It is also the name of a village along the river. River Located in central Belize, the mangroves located at the mouth of this river are the tallest ever reported for the Caribbean region and among the tallest anywhere in the entire Neotropical realm. The mouth of the Sittee River represents the optimal conditions for mangrove development and the forest found there has a high level of structural development. Freshwater flows and sediments carried by the river itself, draining from the Maya Mountains, and tidal flushing from the Caribbean Sea all support this tree growth. The forest at the mouth of the river is composed of three mangrove species: red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans). Village Sittee River Village has a population of 312. In 2001, the arrival of Hurricane Iris caused significant flooding in the community. Located in Sittee River Village, Serpon Sugar Mill is the ruins of a 19th- century sugar refinery which has been designated a park. There is a small general store with camping and a community phone on the main village road.

This species is common along the west coast of Africa, where it prefers moderately shallow waters. The shell of the snail is distinctively large, spiny, and club-shaped, usually pale brown or tan in colour, with an elongated and straight siphonal canal. Description Bolinus cornutus inhabits moderately shallow waters and prefers gravelled or rocky substrate. It is carnivorous and predatory. Although not as widely utilised as other murex species, such as Bolinus brandaris, Bolinus cornutus is one of the sea snail species from which a rich purple dye, generally referred to as Tyrian purple, can be extracted. The dye is a mucus from the snail's hypobranchial gland, which is secreted for defence and as an aid in predation. Bolinus cornutus is protected by a large, thick, spiny shell, club-shaped and with a broad body whorl. The maximum length of the shell is approximately 200 millimetres. Its spire is low and the body whorl has six or seven varices, each varix forming two long, hollow spines. Short spines also spiral off the long, straight siphonal canal of the shell, which is narrowly open along its length. The buff or tan shell colour is interrupted on the body whorl by three darker brown spiral bands, spaced evenly. The majority of the ovate aperture of the shell is white, with an \\"apricot\\" shade on the lip edge, the inductura, and the parietal callus.

A large portion of his compositions were based in folklore and he also arranged and harmonized roughly 400 French and Canadian folksongs; many of which were written for his collaborations with Charles Marchand and the Alouette Vocal Quartet. He worked as an arranger or accompanist on numerous 78 rpm recordings for such labels as Bluebird, Brunswick, Columbia, Starr, and Victor. He contributed numerous articles on folklore to publications like Le Canada français and was a frequent lecturer on folklore subjects. In 1978 CBC Radio recognized O'Brien in a series of six broadcasts featuring his harmonizations. Life and career Born in Ottawa, O'Brien was a pupil of Amédée Tremblay with whom he began studying both the piano and the organ as a young teenager. At the age of 16 he was appointed Tremblay's deputy organist at the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica, Ottawa. He continued to study with Tremblay while taking courses as De La Salle Academy and the University of Ottawa. In 1917 he moved to Montreal where he lived and worked for the rest of his life as a teacher, orchestral pianist, and accompanist. Among his pupils were Joseph Beaulieu, Lionel Daunais, Hector Gratton, Jacques Labrecque, Allan McIver, Lucien Sicotte, and Albert Viau. In 1915 O'Brien became Charles Marchand's accompanist and arranger, a partnership which lasted until Marchand's death in 1930. Marchand instilled a love for folk music in O'Brien and that genre of music made up much of their concert repertoire. The two men toured throughout North America together in concerts and recitals. They also made a number of recordings. In 1927 they performed music composed and arranged by O'Brien at the first CPR Festivals in Quebec. They also performed in the 1928 CPR Festivals and in 1930 O'Brien became the assistant music director of the Festivals for its final year. From 1930 to 1945 O'Brien worked as the artistic director of the Alouette Vocal Quartet (AVQ) which included singers Roger Filiatrault (baritone), André Trottier (bass), Jules Jacob (tenor), and Émile Lamarre (bass). He wrote many of the group's arrangements of French and Canadian folksongs and the group also performed some of his original compositions. The ensemble made several recordings for Victor Records and Bluebird Records and performed on hundreds of radio broadcasts. The quartet gave regular concert tours in the United States, mainly performing in New York City, Washington D.C., Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In 1934 the AVQ was selected as Canada's official delegate to France for the celebrations marking the fourth centenary of the discovery of Canada. In 1937 the quartet gave 35 concerts on a tour of France and Belgium. In 1945 the quartet toured to Brazil after which O'Brien left the group. A devout Roman Catholic, O'Brien became interested in pursuing a religious life and entered the Benedictine monastery at Saint Benedict Abbey, Quebec as a novitiate in 1945. He took his vows in 1947 and was later ordained a priest in 1952 at which time he became known as Dom Oscar O'Brien.

Alexander (Alec) had completed in 1881 his MA with Honours at the University of Aberdeen and in 1885 was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1889, he was appointed headmaster of Allan Glen's Technical School in Glasgow, and the family moved there. However, his health began to deteriorate and he was diagnosed with pneumonia. The couple travelled to South Africa, where the hotter weather contributed for Alec's health to improve considerably, but as soon as they returned to Glasgow, he became ill again and died in November 1890. Marjory thus found herself a widow at the age of thirty-three, and with her two small children, David and Patuffa, to look after. She settled at 5 Mayfield RoadEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1891-2 in southern Edinburgh with her mother and two sisters and made her living as a music teacher and lecturer. In the 1890s, Kennedy-Fraser gave lecture recitals at the Summer Meetings which Patrick Geddes organised at University Hall Extension in Edinburgh.John Kemplay (2009), The Paintings of John Duncan: A Scottish Symbolist, Pomegranate, p. 43 In 1911 she is listed as a piano teacher at 95a George Street in the centre of Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1911-12 She developed a close friendship with the painter John Duncan, with whom she shared a deep interest in the Celtic Revival. They made a trip to Eriskay in 1905, in which occasion he painted her against the island's landscape. While in Eriskay, Marjory witnessed many Gaelic folk songs endangered of disappearing as a result of population decline, and, being herself a singer, began a personal project to record and transcribe the music of the Hebrides. 100px The Kennedy- Fraser grave, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh In the following years, she visited many of the islands to the west of Scotland, recording the traditional songs with a wax cylinder phonograph. She later arranged them for voice and piano, or sometimes for harp or clàrsach —an instrument her daughter Helen Patuffa played. The arrangements, with words translated to English by the Rev. Kenneth MacLeod, were published in her three-volume Songs of the Hebrides in the years 1909, 1917 and 1921. A fourth volume, From the Hebrides: Further Gleanings of Tale and Song, followed in 1925. One of the songs included in this collection eventually came to be widely known by the title \\"Eriskay Love Lilt\\". Incidentally, the Rev. Kenneth MacLeod with whom she often collaborated was a famous poet in both Gaelic and English and the long time Church of Scotland minister of Gigha. He is perhaps best known for \\"The Road to the Isles\\" and \\"Thou Isle of Mull\\" and was related to such other literary figures as the journalist James Cameron and the writer Dr. John Cameron of St. Andrews. For her contributions, Marjory was awarded with a CBE, together with an honorary degree of Doctor of Music from the University of Edinburgh, awarded in 1928. In 1930 she presented her archive of songs to the University Library, including her original wax cylinders of recordings. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser died in Edinburgh in the same year. In order to preserve her original wax cylinder recordings, they were re-recorded on tape several decades later for the Sound Archives of the School of Scottish Studies. More recently, they have been digitized and are held in the collections at the University of Edinburgh. Although her parents and husband are buried in the Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh, the substantial gravestone lying against the southern boundary wall, her own grave is in the island of Iona. =Recitals= Marjory and her daughter Patuffa used to present the collected songs in recitals. Below is a description of one such recital given at the Aeolian Hall, New York City, on 17 March 1916. The Russian tenor, Vladimir Rosing frequently performed Kennedy-Fraser's songs in his London recitals. Ezra Pound, reporting as William Atheling in the New Age, declared that Rosing was \\"the first singer who has been adequate to the music.\\" William Atheling, The New Age, 17 April 1919 See also *John Lorne Campbell References External links *Biography by the Edinburgh University Library Category:1857 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Female composers Category:People from Perth, Scotland Category:Scottish composers Category:Scottish female singers Category:20th-century Scottish singers Category:20th-century women singers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Marjory Kennedy-Fraser"},{"id":"27098172","text":"__NOTOC__ Location of Buena Vista in Virginia This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Buena Vista, Virginia.

Burke (November 27, 1895 – October 6, 1998) was an English professor and Catholic priest who served as the eighth president of Saint Ambrose University (then Saint Ambrose College) from 1940 through 1956. A native of Iowa, he attended the college's high school program, and then the college itself, but was expelled from the seminary for a year and a half by the school's administrator for planning an evening of carousing. He eventually acquired a master's degree and a doctorate in English from Yale University and returned to St. Ambrose in 1921 as an instructor. He was appointed the school's president in 1940 and served for sixteen years, then the longest tenure of any St. Ambrose president. He worked as a pastor and a chaplain for many decades after and remained active until shortly before his death in October 1998, at the age of 102. Early life Burke was born November 27, 1895, in Sigourney, Iowa. At the age of 14 he attended St. Ambrose Academy in Davenport, Iowa, which was then the high school program for Saint Ambrose University (then known as Saint Ambrose College) and has now been merged into Assumption High School. He then moved on to St. Ambrose College, but was expelled in his second year when his plans to go carousing were discovered by the school authorities. He was not permitted to return to the seminary for a year and a half. He was eventually ordained a priest of the Catholic Church in 1921 in Baltimore, Maryland. Career at St. Ambrose Burke had also obtained his master's degree and doctorate in English studies from Yale University and returned to St. Ambrose in 1921 as an English instructor, eventually becoming the head of the department. In 1940 he was appointed to the presidency of the college by Henry Rohlman, then Bishop of the Diocese of Davenport, replacing Carl Meinberg after the latter's retirement. Although he claimed original that he did not want the job, as he would have preferred to continue teaching instead, he served in this capacity for sixteen years, the longest tenure in the post until Edward Rogalski's. During his presidency a library, an administrative building (McMullen Hall), and the Christ the King Chapel were constructed and enrollment reached a then-peak of over 1500 students. During this time he also hosted a three-part series on NBC's Catholic Hour entitled Sainthood, the Universal Vocation. He left the school in 1956 after accepting a position as pastor of St. Mary's Catholic Church. Later life Burke remained at St. Mary's until 1973, when he reached his mandatory retirement, and then served for over a decade as chaplain at the city's Mercy Hospital. Although he was officially retired by 1986, he remained active into his late 90s and continued to attend conventions on Catholicism in Clinton. For his 100th birthday he celebrated a public mass in Clinton and attended a party the following day at St. Ambrose. He died on October 6, 1998, at the age of 102, in Clinton and was buried in Mount Calvary Cemetery in Davenport.

Description The length of the shell varies between 11 mm and 19 mm. The fusiform shell has a moderately high spire and a deep suture. The globose and smooth protoconch contains 1 1/2 whorl. The teleoconch shows strong, elevated, and rounded axial varices set quite far apart from each other (about 6 on the body whorl) and flat spiral cords which overrun the varices. The external surface form an intritacalx (= the chalky outer layer) which gives it a chalky appearance, even on fresh specimens, as is characteristic of the genus. The body whorl has maximum convexity just below the deep suture. Then it is rather parallel sided at the periphery and markedly constricted around the siphonal canal. The aperture is strongly thickened externally by the last varix, with an indistinct inner rim, bearing 5 faint denticles on aged specimens. It is glossy inside in contrast with the outer intritacalx. The siphonal canal is straight and open. The colour of the shell is dirty white, with indistinct yellowish lines along the spiral cords. Distribution This species occurs in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. References * Gofas, S.; Le Renard, J.; Bouchet, P. (2001). Mollusca, in: Costello, M.J. et al. (Ed.) (2001).

Description The shell size of an adult varies between 28 mm and 40 mm. This whitish shell shows four rows of spiny, pointed nodules with numerous smaller spines between. The oval aperture is yellow. The outer lip is with three to four teeth. Drupella cornus lays benthic egg capsules, which hatch into free-swimming planktonic veliger larvae Turner S.J., The egg capsules and early life history of the corallivorous gastropod Drupella cornus (Roeding, 1798)., The Veliger. Vol. 35, no. 1, pp. 16-25. 1992; accessed : 18 November 2010 Drupella cornus is a predator of living coral, grazing on the coral tissue. An abundance of this snail can cause significant destruction to the hard-coral cover on reefs. There is a possible link between coral diseases and an outbreak of this snail. The snail is attracted to Montipora corals when these corals secrete montiporic acids Habitat Drupella cornus commonly occurs on or under tabular corals of the genera Acropora and Montipora or on hard substrates in the lower intertidal zone and shallow sublittoral zone. In areas where Acropora and Montipora coral are rare, D. Cornus has also been known to feed on other corals such as Porites in Kenya, and Pocillopora and Porites in Hawaii. Distribution This species is distributed in the Red Sea and in the Indian Ocean along Aldabra, Chagos, Kenya, Madagascar, the Mascarene Basin, Mozambique, Tanzania, KwaZuluNatal, Gulf of Thailand, Japan, and the Indo-Pacific.

Description Drupella rugosa is a creamy white to orange, conical shell with a height between 20 mm and 35 mm. The sculpture shows five spiral rows of rounded brown nodules separated by twelve axial ribs with fine granules, giving the shell a knobby appearance. The columella is narrow and the anal sinus hardly shows. The elliptical aperture is narrowed by protruding plaits. The outer lip is with five or six teeth. Feeding patterns Drupella rugosa is an obligate corallivore that grazes on the tissue of live corals, especially fast growing or structurally diverse corals such as Acropora and Montipora. Over-populations or outbreaks of the snail have been recorded in multiple regions since the 1980s, and generally occur on reefs impacted by human activities or following mass mortality events such as coral bleaching. D. Rugosa is known to contribute to secondary mortality following such events, and have also been linked to increased prevalence of coral diseases. Distribution and Reproduction This species is distributed in the intertidal zone and shallow rocky areas in the Red Sea and in the Indian Ocean along Aldabra, Chagos, Madagascar, the Mascarene Basin, the Gulf of Thailand, and in the Western Pacific. Little is known about their reproductive cycle, however it was recently documented in the Gulf of Thailand that they use the skeletons of the corals they have recently consumed on which to lay their benthic eggs, particularly on corals of the Fungiidae Family.

In 2013 at The Walkley Awards, she won the \\"Feature Writing Long (over 4000 words) Award\\" for her piece Sinking below sight: Down and out in Brisbane and Logan. In 2019, she won the Miles Franklin award for Too Much Lip. Biography Melissa Lucashenko was born in 1967 in Brisbane, Australia. Her heritage is Bundjalung and European. She is a graduate of Griffith University (1990), with an honours degree in public policy. In 1992 she was a founding member of Sisters Inside, an organisation which supports women and girls in prison. She has said that when she began writing seriously \\"there was still a glaring hole in Australian literature\\", with almost no prominent Aboriginal voices and with only the University of Queensland Press and a few other small outlets publishing the work of Aboriginal writers. When asked whether she considers herself primarily a writer, or an Aboriginal writer, she writes that the question runs into semantic difficulties, because the word means different things to different people. Lucashenko's first work to be published was the novel Steam Pigs (1997), which won the Dobbie Literary Award for Australian women's fiction. It was also a short-list nominee for the NSW Premier's Award and the regional Commonwealth Writers' Prize. In 1998 she released the novel Killing Darcy, which won the Aurora Prize of the Royal Blind Society, was a finalist for the 1998 Aurealis Award for best young-adult novel and named on the 1998 James Tiptree Jr Memorial Award long list. In 1999 her third novel, Hard Yards was published and was a finalist in both the 1999 NSW Premier's Literary Awards and the 2001 Courier-Mail Book of the Year. In 2002 her fourth novel Too Flash, written for young adults, was published. Lucashenko's fifth novel, Mullumbimby, won the prestigious Deloitte Fiction Book Award in 2013 and the Victorian Premier's Literary Award for Indigenous Writing in 2014, as well as being nominated for several other awards. In 2015 it was longlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award. She is also an accomplished essayist, winning the 2013 \\"Feature Writing Long (over 4000 words)\\" Walkley Award for Sinking below sight: Down and out in Brisbane and Logan. Speaking about this essay, Lucashenko said that she was partly informed by her studies in public policy: \\"...one thing I was trying to bring out in the piece was the odd mix of structural factors and just sheer luck, good and bad, that makes up people's lives. All of these women are poor because of the violence and because of intergenerational poverty, and those things can be attacked in policy and should be attacked in policy.\\". In March 2014 The Moth Radio Hour aired a recording of Lucashenko recounting the story of moving with her husband and daughter back to the Aboriginal lands in New South Wales (where her great-grandmother grew up), and subsequent divorce from her husband and mental illness of her daughter. Lucashenko was awarded the Copyright Agency Author Fellowship in 2016 to focus on her new novel, which was published as Too Much Lip in 2018. In early 2019, the novel was shortlisted for the Stella Prize. Judges called it \\"...a fearless, searing and unvarnished portrait of generational trauma cut through with acerbic humour.\\" The novel went on to win the 2019 Miles Franklin Award. In May 2019, Cenozoic Pictures optioned Too Much Lip for a screen adaptation, with Lucashenko as a co-writer and co- creator alongside Cenozoic's Veronica Gleeson.

They are below the thalamus and consist of three defined, white matter areas of the subthalamus. These three regions are also named \\"H fields\\": *Field H1, is the thalamic fasciculus, a horizontal white matter tract composed of the ansa lenticularis, lenticular fasciculus, and cerebellothalamic tracts between the subthalamus and the thalamus. These fibers are projections to the ventral anterior and ventral lateral thalamus from the basal ganglia (globus pallidus) and the cerebellum. H1 is separated from H2 by the zona incerta. *Field H2 (synonymous with lenticular fasciculus) is also made up of projections from the pallidum to the thalamus, but these course the subthalamic nucleus (dorsal). *Field H (sometimes called field H3) is a large zone of mixed grey and white matter from the pallidothalamic tracts of the lenticular fasciculus and the ansa lenticularis which combine in an area just in front of the red nucleus. The grey matter from this field is said to form a prerubral nucleus.

Yan Xiaoling (), a 25-year-old woman from Minqing County, was found dead in February 2008 and was believed by her mother Lin Xiuying () to be murdered after being gang raped by a group of ruffians who had connection with the local police, while the officials insisted that she had died from an ectopic pregnancy. Three human rights activists in Fuzhou, Fan Yanqiong (), You Jingyou () and Wu Huaying (), offered assistance by interviewing Yan's mother and putting the filmed footage online on June 24, 2009, but were soon, among several other netizens, arrested by Fuzhou police and thrown into custody. The three were charged with, but never legally convicted of, making false and malicious accusation and had been detained for nine months before the final verdict was announced on April 16, 2010 without any public trial. The case ended with Fan Yanqiong being sentenced to two years in jail and You Jingyou and Wu Huaying to one year. Fujian authorities later asked for the release of the suspects and an appeal was filed, but it was dismissed in court and the original verdict was upheld.

In 2002, she was elected to the National Council of Austria, where she served on the committees for family, health, interior and education affairs, and chaired the committee on health affairs. She was her party's top candidate in Lower Austria in the 2008 election. The election was a major success for her party, which more than doubled their representation in the parliament. She resigned as member of the National Council on 9 April 2008, and the following day she was appointed to the cabinet of the state as Minister of Building Law and Animal Protection. =Party offices= Barbara Rosenkranz was elected deputy chair of her party in the state of Lower Austria in 1996. She was additionally secretary general of the state party 1998-1999, and in 2003, she was elected chair of the state party. Since 2005, she has also been deputy chair of the Freedom Party at the federal level. =Candidate for President of Austria= Barbara Rosenkranz was the candidate of the Freedom Party for the 2010 Austrian presidential election. Her candidacy was officially presented by the Freedom Party on 2 March 2010. The Kronen Zeitung, the largest newspaper of Austria, supported her candidacy in articles written by its publisher Hans Dichand. The conservative party, the Austrian People's Party, didn't nominate a candidate (their last presidential candidate was Benita Ferrero-Waldner in 2004, who narrowly lost to Heinz Fischer), but refused to endorse any of the two major candidates, incumbent social democrat Heinz Fischer and Barbara Rosenkranz. Rosenkranz received 15.6% of the vote, coming second after Fischer. A third candidate, Rudolf Gehring of the small Christian Party, polled 6%. The voter turnout was only 53.6%, however (compared to 70.8% in 2004, and the lowest in modern history). Political positions A self-described national conservative, she is a controversial and polarizing figure in Austria. She has been a vocal critic of the European Union, immigration and restrictions to the freedom of speech like the Austrian anti-Nazi laws. She is known for her conservative views on the family and social policyhttp://www.salzburg.com/online/nachrichten/newsletter/Die-Welt-der- Barbara- Rosenkranz.html?article=eGMmOI8V5gly3VzCjrNXEkulXX3Ejlx1YsjSVs7&img;=&text;=&mode;= =Social policy= Rosenkranz advocates conservative views on immigration, social policy and the family.

September 2008 She also advocates the reintroduction of border controls.FPÖ-NÖ: LR Rosenkranz: Grenzkontrollen sofort wiedereinführen , 26 November 2009 =Views on national socialism= Rosenkranz' husband, Horst Rosenkranz is a publisher of far right material and was formerly a member of the now-banned National Democratic Party (NDP), a far right party, and the question of whether she shares her husband's beliefs has caused some controversy. Some Austrian media have referred to Rosenkranz as \\"Reich Mother\\". In 1995 Rosenkranz brought a defamation case against the publicist Hans-Henning Scharsach for referring to her as an example of a \\"Kellernazi\\", that is, a closet sympathizer of National Socialist beliefs. The lawsuit led to a fine against Scharsach's newspaper, \\"News\\". This decision was criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, however, as a violation of freedom of speech, as they considered it a matter of opinion, and that Rosenkranz's attitude towards the Nazi past was thoroughly ambiguous. Key points in this ruling were that she had never distanced herself from her husband's activities in the extreme right, and that in the past had been a vocal public opponent of the Verbotsgesetz 1947 law banning Holocaust denial.Dokumentationsarchiv des österreichischen Widerstandes: Rechtsextreme Funktionäre, Aktivisten und Ideologen. Rechtsextremismus in Österreich. Accessed 2 March 2010. Both Scharsach and \\"News\\" were awarded damages.Chamber judgment in the case of Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft mbH v. Austria , Pressemitteilung des EGMR, 13 November 2003 When once asked whether she believed in the existence of gas chambers in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II in an interview with Austrian Radio (ORF), she replied that she has the knowledge of an Austrian \\"who went to school in Austria between 1964 and 1976 -- so that is my knowledge of history and I have no plan whatsoever to change it\\". As this answer was criticised as being \\"evasive\\", she later stated in an interview with Die Presse, that there is no doubt that terrible crimes were committed during the Nazi regime.Die Presse.com: , 7 März 2010 Historian Lothar Höbelt, head of the supporting committee for Rosenkranz, criticized the media of a \\"manipulating campaign\\" against her, and argued that some of these statements were several years old or taken out of context. Personal life Barbara Rosenkranz is married to Horst Rosenkranz, and has 10 children, 6 girls and 4 boys. She studied history and philosophy at the University of Vienna, but didn't graduate. Although raised as a Catholic, she has criticised the church authorities in Austria, and left the Church several years ago. None of her children are baptized.
