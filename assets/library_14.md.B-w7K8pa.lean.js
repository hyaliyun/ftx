Career Lewis attended Southside High School in Muncie, where his father was the coach for many years. He then went on to attend Florida State University. In 1986, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Originally drafted by the Montreal Expos 44th overall in the 1987 draft, Lewis spent a few years in the minors before making his big-league debut. He played only two games professionally in 1987, both in AAA ball. He would prove to be a very valuable minor league player over the next few seasons, both as a starter and reliever. For example, he posted a 2.58 ERA in as a starter, and in with the Jacksonville Expos he posted a 1.26 ERA as a reliever. He made his MLB debut on July 31, 1992 at the age of 26. Standing at the height of , Lewis—who is one of the shortest players ever to pitch in the majors—pitched just over four innings in his debut (he started the game). He gave up five hits and walked six, but he still managed to earn the win. Lewis was selected in the 51st round of the 1992 Expansion draft by the Florida Marlins. He would mostly be used as a reliever for the rest of his career, with his best season being . In 57 games, he posted a 3.26 ERA and 65 strikeouts. Overall, he went 14 and 15 in his career, with 191 walks, 244 strikeouts and a 4.88 ERA in 217 games. Although his major league career ended on June 4, 1998, he bounced around in the minors until 2003. He was the pitching coach for the Columbus Catfish in 2006. A recurring glitch in the EA Sports Triple Play video game franchise caused Lewis to throw certain pitches between 111–120 miles per hour, making him one of the most dominant pitchers in all of the games in which the glitch occurred. in 2016, Lewis was featured in an episode of Dr. Phil which dealt with his depression and alcohol issues. Lewis currently resides in Melbourne, Florida, with his family. He has two daughters and one son.

It is situated on the southwest coast of the Avalon Peninsula and defined by a triangular shaped headland which reaches northward out into Placentia Bay creating a natural harbour in length. Originally settled by the French in the 1630s that fishing settlement was called Petit Plaisance, meaning \\"Pleasant Little Place\\". The name was retained in English (Little Placentia) when the French lost control of the area following the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The census of 1706 records 149 individuals in 14 habitations. The community adopted its present name (unofficially in 1895 and officially in 1901) for the presence of silver ore near Broad Cove Point on the east side of the harbour. The name \\"Argentia\\" is Latin, meaning \\"Land of Silver\\" and was chosen by Father John St. John, the parish priest at Holy Rosary Parish from September 18, 1895, to February 11, 1911. The Silver Cliff Mine operated until the early 1920s but was never profitable. Through most of the 19th century, the fishery was the lifeblood of the community; the Newfoundland Commission of Government built a herring factory at Argentia in 1936. The first church and school were established by Father Pelagius Nowlan in 1835. He was from Ireland and moved to Newfoundland as a missionary priest. In 1836, population was made up 484 people in 76 houses. Railway comes to town Construction started on a branch line to nearby Placentia from the Harbour Grace Railway mainline near Whitbourne (what would later become part of the Newfoundland Railway) on October 14, 1886, and the of track were completed by October 1888. This line became known as the \\"Placentia Branch\\" and it served as a key route to Placentia and the nearby port and anchorage of Little Placentia where coastal ferries would run to outports along the south coast of the island. The Newfoundland Railway chose Port aux Basques to be its western terminus in 1893 and a new ferry intended for service to North Sydney, Nova Scotia, was built in Scotland. In October 1897 the new vessel named the SS Bruce arrived but the docks at Port aux Basques had not been completed. As a result, from October until June, 1898 (when it reverted to Port aux Basques), the Bruce operated first from Placentia and then from Little Placentia to North Sydney. Death of a village =Second World War= War between Britain and Nazi Germany was declared on September 3, 1939, after Adolf Hitler's forces invaded Poland. Argentia was selected in 1940 to be the location of the United States Navy's Naval Station Argentia being built under the United States-British Destroyers for Bases Agreement (which preceded the introduction of Lend-Lease in 1941) which saw fifty obsolete US destroyers given to Britain in exchange for control of selected lands controlled by Britain in the Western Hemisphere. The Argentia site was selected due to its proximity to Europe, the relatively ice-free nature of Placentia Bay, the safe navigational access channel, the sheltered harbour with secure deepwater anchorages nearby at Fox Harbour and Ship Harbour, as well as the local topography for an airfield and the existing railway line. The base was urgently needed as part of the trans-Atlantic supply line which joined North America to Britain, in order to provide anti-submarine patrols to protect shipping from the German U-boat fleet. =Lend-lease arrangement= The land beneath the village was traded to the United States for construction of the base under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement and the residents of Argentia and Marquise received the following notices: In exercise of the powers conferred upon me by the Defence (requisition of land) Regulations, made under the Emergency Powers Defence Act 1940, on the 28th day of December AD 1940, I do authorize all persons who shall be engaged by the United States Government or its agents and contractors on the construction for that government of any naval, military or air works at Argentia to do any work on any land or place any thing in, on, or over any land upon the Argentia Peninsula, insofar as it shall be necessary for any such person so to do for the carrying out of any such work of construction including any preliminary work in relation thereto. Provided, however, that this present authority shall not be valid to authorize the demolition, pulling down or destruction of any building or erection upon any such land, or the doing of any act which renders any such building or erection intangible. Signed, Wilfrid Woods, Commissioner for Public Utilities \\"The Defence (requisition of land) Regulations made under the Emergency Powers Defence Act 1940 on the 28th day of December, A.D., 1940. I have to notify you that the lands and buildings lately belonging to and occupied by you at Argentia, for which said lands and buildings payment has been awarded, are required for occupation by the Government of Newfoundland not later than . Take notice, therefore, that the said premises must be completely vacated by you and peaceably yielded up to the Government of Newfoundland, its servants, agents, on or before the date mentioned. Signed: WW Woods, Commissioner for Public Utilities\\" =Relocation= When Argentia village was demolished during the Second World War and its people were moved mostly to nearby PlacentiaMost people relocated to the nearby villages of Freshwater or Placentia. However what little had been paid as compensation (usually no more than a few thousand dollars for homeowners in Argentia) proved inadequate for building equivalent new homes due to severe wartime shortages of labour and materials. Those buried in the three local graveyards were exhumed and reburied in a new cemetery constructed by the US forces at the insistence of the local parish priest, Father A.J. Dee, who had also raised objections to the wartime delays in finding new housing for Argentia's living residents who were being forced to leave the village. The abandoned homes were ultimately burned or levelled by bulldozers. The US flag was raised in Argentia on February 13, 1941.

The navy base construction in particular was a priority with Navy Operating Base Argentia being officially commissioned on July 15, 1941. =Atlantic Charter= HMS Prince of Wales in Ship Harbour, Newfoundland for the Atlantic Charter The reason for the rush was made clear on August 7, 1941, when the heavy cruiser USS Augusta (CA-31) carrying U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt arrived at an anchorage outside Argentia near Ship Harbour. Roosevelt inspected the base construction progress and did some fishing from Augusta over the next two days. Augusta was joined by the British warship HMS Prince of Wales carrying British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on August 9, 1941. While in the Ship Harbour anchorage from August 9–12, the chiefs of staff of Britain and the US met to discuss the war strategies and logistics once the US joined the war. The two leaders and their aides also negotiated the wording of a press release that they called a \\"joint statement\\". Though not drafted as a legal agreement requiring signatures, Roosevelt and Churchill did sign their own draft markups of the joint statement which was issued as a press release on August 14, 1941, in Washington, D.C., and was issued simultaneously in London, England. Several days later the Daily Herald, a London newspaper, would characterize the contents of that press release as the Atlantic Charter. statement. On August 28, 1941, Naval Station Argentia was officially commissioned by the US Navy. Argentia would prove to be an important base in the US war effort; by 1943 with the U.S. fully involved in the Second World War, Argentia saw upwards of 10,000 US personnel passing through on the way to the European Theatre. An adjoining United States Army base was established as Fort McAndrew to provide anti-aircraft artillery protection for the navy base and naval air station. In 1946 Fort McAndrew became part of the United States Army Air Forces and was renamed McAndrew Air Force Base in 1948. =Cold War= With VE in 1945, Argentia saw a drop in personnel but by the start of the Cold War in 1947–1948, personnel numbers rose to 7,000. By the end of the Korean War in 1953, Argentia saw a total of 8,500 personnel posted in the area. In 1955 McAndrew AFB was deactivated and turned over to the US Navy as the US Air Force moved its personnel to more remote and northern locations along the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador to build radar stations which would become part of the Pinetree Line and DEW Line systems. In the 1960s Naval Station Argentia became a key \\"node\\" in the US Navy's SOSUS underwater hydrophone system. As such, the base was the target for several espionage attempts by the Soviet Union. By 1969 the total US Navy and Marine Corps contingents had dropped to 3,000 and to 1,000 by 1971. =Closure and abandonment= As facilities and structures closed, assets were transferred to the Government of Canada under the terms of the U.S.-Britain lend-lease program; Newfoundland having become a Canadian province in 1949. In 1973 Naval Air Station Argentia was closed and by 1975 the entire north side of the base was out of US hands. In 1994 Naval Operating Base Argentia, was officially decommissioned and the site was transferred to the Government of Canada. From 1994 to 2007, the Government of Canada carried out a $106 million environmental remediation program at Argentia which included the removal of many building structures, and the clean up, removal or safe containment of various hazardous materials on the land and in the water about the site. Concurrently, by 2001, the site was turned over to a private, not-for-profit organization to manage and lead the redevelopment of Argentia. With the military base now closed, Argentia has no permanent residents and is zoned as an industrial area in support of its redevelopment as a seaport and industrial park for the Town of Placentia. Redevelopment Argentia became part of Town of Placentia in 1993, along with Freshwater, Dunville, Jerseyside and townside Placentia. By the end of 2001, Government of Canada had negotiated land transfer agreements to return the lands which formerly comprised the US Naval Base to local ownership and control. Port of Argentia, is the port and property authority for the industrial area and is utilizing these former naval base properties to lead the redevelopment of the site to revitalize the local economy and quality of life in the region. In June 2002, Inco announced an agreement with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador on a three phase plan to develop the Voisey's Bay nickel deposit. The $1 billion initial phase of the Voisey's Bay agreement provided for mine and mill infrastructure development at Voisey's Bay, and a research and development program in hydrometallurgical processing which would include a demonstration plant to be built at Argentia. the demonstration plant at Argentia was constructed and operated from 2004 to 2007. The demonstration plant was an initial step toward the ultimate development of a commercial hydrometallurgical processing facility, the Long Harbour Nickel Processing Plant, to be constructed and operated in Long Harbour.Inco announcement In October, 2013, Husky Energy and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador announced an agreement to amend the White Rose Development. White Rose is the name of an oil field offshore Newfoundland. The announcement included the news that this oil resource could be exploited by installing a gravity based 'wellhead platform' structure over the western section of the oil field on the ocean floor in approximately of water. To support this billion dollar wellhead platform construction project, Husky announced that it would be establishing a graving dock facility on the Northside Peninsula at Argentia to support the construction of the concrete base of the wellhead platform. Construction of the graving dock began in late 2013 and was finished in early 2015. However, in December 2014, Husky announced that, due to declining oil prices, the decision to construct the Concrete Gravity Base (CGS) had been deferred. Transportation =Airport= The former US Navy Air Station airfield on the Northside Peninsula has not been active for air traffic since 1973 other than for the Air Cadet Gliding Program. =Ferry terminal= Naval Station Argentia By the mid-1960s roads were upgraded between Argentia and the newly opened Trans- Canada Highway at Whitbourne. In 1967 a new ferry terminal was opened by Canadian National Railway and the Ambrose Shea became the first seasonal ferry to call at the port, largely carrying tourists bound for the Avalon Peninsula (19 hours crossing time) from North Sydney, Nova Scotia. In the 1980s the terminal was upgraded by CN Marine and in 1989 the company's successor, Marine Atlantic, welcomed the MV Joseph and Clara Smallwood superferry (14 hours crossing time) on the Argentia summer run.

Peasants killed the members of prodotryad and circulated the appeal to rise. On February 9 the chairman of Menzelinsk committee and the chief of Zainsk militia were killed in Yanga Yelan. On February 10 the peasants killed the Soviet representative in Zainsk. The uprising spread to the Belebeysky, Birsky uyezds of the Ufa Governorate, Chistopolsky Uyezd of the Kazan Governorate, Bugulminsky Uyezd of the Samara Governorate. The staff of the uprising was found under I. Milovanov. Their slogans were Down with the communist and the Civil War, long live the Constituent Assembly! The peasant army known as \\"Black Eagle\\" counted 50,000 rebels. However, they were armed only with pitchforks, axes, and spades, which gave the name to the uprising. Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic (Cheka) used heavy machine guns and artillery against them.

The Juice JVM, designed for real-time Java, was specifically developed to run on the NUXI operating system. The most relevant features of Juice are related to the structure for the heap memory, to the object allocation policy and to the garbage collector used.  Heap memory  In Juice, all the available heap memory is shared in \\"chunks\\" of pre-fixed size. The memory unit used is the \\"d-word\\" (that stands for \\"double- word\\"). The actual default size of the chunks is fixed to 64 d-words. The free memory chunks are organized in a linked list, while the chunks occupied by Java objects are connected to each other through a hierarchical structure in a way that resembles the representation of the UNIX file system.  Real-time object allocation policy  The object allocation policy in Juice is strictly connected to the structure used to represent heap memory. Because of this structure, it becomes possible to allocate (and deallocate) Java objects in a time that is dependent only on the size of the object itself (predictability).  The Pay-per-Use garbage collector  The proposed garbage collector is based on a non-copying tracing collector that performs memory reclamation only when a new object has to be allocated. The name of the garbage collector is because the cost paid by the mutator, in terms of wasted time for collector execution, is proportional to the size of the object to allocate.

A dzielnica may have its own elected council (rada dzielnicy, or dzielnica council), and those of Warsaw each have their own mayor (burmistrz). Like the osiedle and sołectwo, a dzielnica is an auxiliary unit (jednostka pomocnicza) of a gmina. These units are created by decision of the gmina council, and do not have legal personality in their own right. The subsidiary units of many towns and cities are called osiedles rather than dzielnicas, although it is also possible for osiedles to exist within a dzielnica. Numbers and sizes of dzielnicas vary significantly between cities. Warsaw has 18 dzielnicas, as does Kraków; Gdańsk has 34, Gdynia 22, Lublin 27, Katowice 22 and Szczecin 4. Some cities are no longer formally divided into dzielnicas, although formerly existing dzielnicas continue to be referred to as such and serve as areas of jurisdiction for administrative offices. Łódź, Wrocław and Poznań are each divided into five districts of this type. The word dzielnica is also used informally in Polish to refer to any distinct part of a town or city. Historically it can also refer to a region of the country, in particular any of the five principalities into which Poland was divided following the death of Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1138; see Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty.

Based at Kildonan Aerodrome and Collinstown Dublin, it operated between 1931 and 1995. Early beginnings When Hugh Cahill started an aviation wing of his motor company - Iona - at Cross Guns Bridge in Dublin in 1931, he was already well known as a Dublin entrepreneur. Initially the Irish Government did not back the proposal for a civil aerodrome, and refused to allow Cahill a licence. It was not until after a few months in operation, when Iona National Airways flights became frequent and after Baldonnel was no longer seen as a location for civil aviation, that the licence was granted. Cahill's chosen site for the aerodrome, was at Kildonan House near Finglas in Dublin. The site was about 3 miles from his garage, making it easy to service aircraft back at base, at Cross Guns Bridge. Iona National Airways, operated out of Kildonan for two years until mid 1933, when Cahill's attentions were re-focused on his motor business. Despite this, two other airlines were to operate from Kildonan, including Dublin Air Ferries (DAF), which was run and owned by the noted aviator Lady Mary Heath and her husband, Jack Williams. Returning to the air Iona National Airways Fairchild-Hiller FH-227 in 1994 In 1955 Pearse Cahill, Hugh Cahill's son, recognised an opportunity in the Irish Aviation market (Ireland had no major flying club, and no major secondary airline). Aer Lingus was also struggling to survive in the economic recessions of Ireland (which allowed for other enterprises to develop). Pearse did not rush into creating a modern airline, possibly because the money he received from his father to do other things (especially not to fly) may not have been enough to buy larger aircraft. Nonetheless, Pearse bought and shipped in three ex-RAF DH Chipmunk aircraft into Ireland. This was to restart the Irish Aero Club, rivalling activities at nearby Weston airfield. Soon afterwards, Pearse realised that he could make aviation in Ireland profitable for Iona, and he imported aircraft for flying clubs around the country, firmly establishing the country with companies such as Cessna and Piper, as well as handling the majority of engine overhauls at Dublin Airport. Iona flourished; media reporters would rent out Iona aircraft for air-to-ground photographs, and for media reports. Iona was on the front line, even the ever-upsetting images of the Stardust Disco tragedy from the air, which have never been forgotten, and have been immortalised in the recent Irish Independent \\"100 Years Of\\" magazine; were taken from an Iona aircraft. Iona had earned a place in Irish hearts and in the late seventies, Iona delivered Cessna 172's to the Irish Air Corps, several of which are still flying today. Throughout the early eighties Iona served the market with international air ambulances, regional services and flight training. Decline and liquidation Following the demise of Avair in February 1984 Iona operated a number of their regional routes, such as Dublin-Sligo. When Ireland West Airport Knock was officially opened on 30 May 1986, Peter Cahill flew the Taoiseach Charles Haughey and Pearse Cahill, from Dublin to Knock to perform the official opening ceremony in the presence of Monsignor James Horan.Traynor 2004, p. 147 By the early 1990s, Iona had suffered economical problems. It was further affected by the decision of FedEx and DHL to end services to Ireland. Other problems included issues with several statutory governing bodies. Iona may have had an opportunity to restructure, but political conditions were unfavourable. These factors led to the liquidation of Iona National Airways Limited in 1995, having flown its last flight on 14 December 1994. After-effects Ryanair, Loganair and Aer Arann eventually took over most of the Iona passenger routes, and today, Air Contractors, one of Europe's biggest cargo carriers, operate some of their old routes. To the Irish flying community however, the main loss was the option provided by Iona to learn how to fly relatively cheaply. Iona had entertained enthusiasts at their facilities, as well as supporting non-commercial aviation with fly-ins, open days, aviation events, and a flying club. These outlets were not replaced.

However, it appears in none of the Canonical gospels of the New Testament but only in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. According to the Gospel of Thomas 97 Jesus said: :\\"The kingdom of the father is like a certain woman who was carrying a jar full of meal. While she was walking on the road, still some distance from home, the handle of the jar broke and the meal emptied out behind her on the road. She did not realize it; she had noticed no accident. When she reached her house, she set the jar down and found it empty.\\" Authenticity The scholars of the Jesus Seminar gave the Parable of the Empty Jar a \\"pink\\" rating, indicating that it is in their opinion probably, but not certainly, an authentic saying of Jesus. The scholars of the Seminar noted parallels with the parable of the leaven, which immediately precedes the parable of the empty jar in the Gospel of Thomas and the parable of the mustard seed: in all three the kingdom starts with something \\"unnoticed or unexpected or modest\\". However, the work of the Jesus Seminar has been criticized by other scholars. Interpretation This parable has been given a wide variety of interpretations. It may be a warning against letting the \\"Kingdom\\", which according to Thomas 3 is \\"inside of you and outside of you\\" slip away like the lost flour: it may also be a simple warning against self-confidence. The emptiness of the jar may represent an empty life: \\"people who live their lives in the world ... carry jars they think are full, but discover, even after much activity, that they are empty\\". Another interpretation is that the parable refers to \\"the imperceptible coming of the Kingdom\\". One commentator recasts the emptiness of the jar in a positive light by highlighting the contrast of the image of the empty jar with the expected ending of the woman finding a full jar: such a \\"happy ending\\" would be \\"fairy tale religiosity\\" whereas \\"emptiness in the world is what is critical to eventual spiritual fullness\\". Ray Shortell believes the parable Alexandrian/Stoic anti-sexist/anti-xenophobic against the temple, represented by the cracked jar carried by a priestess. The knowledge of our creator is strewn across all roads and thinking to contain it leaves one with less. As Jesus said, ‘you may say to worship at the temple, but I say to worship in spirit and truth.‘ References Empty Jar ","title":"Parable of the empty jar"},{"id":"9692221","text":"\\"In A Free Land\\" is a song by Hüsker Dü released as a single in 1982.

A west tower was added around 1800 and the church was restored, extended and made Gothic, with tower battlements, in 1871–2.Raven, Michael, 2005, A Guide to Shropshire (third edition), page 182 The church and a lodge near Sibdon Castle are both Grade II listed.Images of England St Michael's ChurchImages of England Lodge at Sibdon Castle Otherwise the hamlet consists of a farm with its own farmhouse, a small number of cottages and numerous outbuildings. Just to the northeast lies Sibdon Pool, a historic 1.3 hectareBARS Action Plans Sibdon Pool fishing pool. A private tree-lined carriage drive connects the main hamlet with the Clun Road (the B4368). A number of public right of ways converge on the hamlet, giving the public access to the church, one of which is part of the \\"Shropshire Way\\" and \\"Wart Hill Wanderer\\".Wart Hill Wander – a guide to the route The parish The population of the whole parish was recorded as 82 persons, in 34 households, by the 2001 Census.National Statistics Neighbourhood – South Shropshire parishes Instead of a parish council it has a parish meeting;Shropshire Council Local Joint Committee 24: Craven Arms and Rural this is due to the very small population of the parish. There is a parish noticeboard on Watling Street. The parish forms part of the Church Stretton and Craven Arms electoral division of Shropshire Council, the local council. The eastern border of the parish is Watling Street, a Roman road – the other side of this lane is Craven Arms parish. The northern border is Long Lane, with the parish of Wistanstow to the north, whilst to the west is Hopesay Hill and Common. The parish lies on the eastern slope of the hill, between the summit and the town of Craven Arms (where the River Onny flows through); Sibdon Castle itself is at 187 metres above sea level. The western half of the parish, including the main hamlet, lies within the Shropshire Hills AONB, with the lane running through the parish forming the boundary.Shropshire Hills AONB boundary map This western half of the parish is on a steeper gradient and is more wooded, with Sibdon Wood and Oldfield Wood, as well as parkland style trees. The parish also includes half of the hamlet of Long Meadowend, which is situated in the southwestern corner of the parish, at the junction of the B4367, B4368 and the main lane through the parish, which runs north to Long Lane. (However the junction at Long Meadowend lies in Hopesay parish.) The B4368 road (running from Craven Arms to Clun) and the Heart of Wales Line run through the southern part of the parish, with the nearest railway stations at Broome and Craven Arms. A small number of holiday cottages now exist in the parish, on Long Lane and Watling Street. Also on Watling Street a farm has diversified since 2004 into an activities centre for children and groups, which has in recent years created large (temporary) outdoor mazes in nearby fields, including corn mazes.Mickey Millers Maze Maize archives Long Lane is part of the \\"Six Castles Cycleway\\" and the National Cycle Network route 44.Shropshire Council Six Castle Cycleway Etymology and history The parish lies on the ancient Watling Street, now a lane. The place is occasionally written simply with the first part of the name, which has been spelt variously over the centuries. Originally \\"Sibton\\" (in the Domesday Book of 1086 it is recorded as \\"Sibetune\\"), from Saxon origin meaning \\"Sibba's farmstead\\". The second part of the full name, Carwood, means \\"the wood where the rocks are found\\".Poulton-Smith, Anthony, 2009, Shropshire Place Names, page 131-2 The name Carwood is also given to a wooded slope, north of Wart Hill in the north of Hopesay parish, and to three cottages there. The Norman barons who locally had their power base at Clun Castle, the de Say (or \\"Sai\\") family, held the manor after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The name of the neighbouring village and parish, Hopesay, derives from \\"Hope de Say\\" – \\"the valley of Say\\". During the medieval period, the Welsh Marches was an area of instability and conflict, ruled by the Marcher lords. The Domesday Book records Sibdon as having 6 households, making it quite a small manor population-wise.Open Domesday Sibdon Carwood The fortified manor at Sibdon Carwood, the predecessor to the 17th-century Sibdon Castle country house, is given the name \\"Shepeton Corbet\\" by a number of historical documents, including that of John Leland (c. 1535–43), who also gives the suffix to Hopton Castle and Moreton Corbet castle.Internet Archive Itinerary of John Leland This is an indication that the Corbet family owned these fortified manors around the time, of which Moreton Corbet's castle both remains in their ownership and retains the suffix to this day. About a mile to the north, in the neighbouring hamlet of Cheney Longville, was Cheney Longville Castle. A description of the parish published in 1848 records that 59 people lived in the parish, which was wholly owned by the Sibdon Castle estate. It also noted a perpetual curacy, with a net income of £50.British History Online A Topographical Dictionary of England (1848), pp. 104–107 Originally the manor of Sibdon was part of the hundred of Rinlau, as recorded in the Domesday Book, however in the 12th century the hundreds of Shropshire were greatly reformed and the parish from then on came within the hundred of Purslow. In 1894 it became part of Ludlow Rural District and then in 1974 the non-metropolitan district of South Shropshire. In 2009 there was another re-organisation of local administration, with the creation of a unitary authority covering most of Shropshire. The nearby town of Craven Arms is a relatively recent development in the area – it was established only in the mid-19th century, being at the junction of a number of newly-laid railway lines. With much of its recent growth towards the west of the town, its urban area has reached Watling Street and its outskirts fringe into Sibdon Carwood parish.

It was presumably first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and reported in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved). Chemistry 2C-T-17 is the 2 carbon homologue of Aleph-17, which has never been synthesized. The full chemical name is 2-[4-(2-butyl thio)-2,5-dimethoxy phenyl]ethanamine. The drug has structural properties similar to drugs in the 2C-T series, with the most closely related compounds being 2C-T-7 and 2C-T-8. General information The dosage range of 2C-T-17 is typically 60-100 mg and its duration is approximately 10–15 hours according to Shulgin. 2C-T-17 has highly psychedelic effects on thinking, but produces few to no visuals. Pharmacology The mechanism that produces 2C-T-17's hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known. Dangers The toxicity of 2C-T-17 is not well documented. 2C-T-17 is much less potent than 2C-T-7, but it may be expected that at very high doses it would display similar toxicity to that of other phenethylamines of the 2C-T family. Legality 2C-T-17 is not illegal, but possession and sales of 2C-T-17 could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to 2C-T-7. =Canada= As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-17 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php =United Kingdom= This substance is a Class A drug in the Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act.

Taplett served with distinction in the Marine Corps for 20 years. He served aboard ship in the Pacific Theater during World War II. During the Korean War, he served as commander of 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. After retiring from the Marine Corps, he authored a book that chronicled his experiences during the Korean War. Biography Taplett was born in Tyndall, South Dakota, on December 10, 1918. He attended the University of South Dakota where he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He graduated with honors in 1940. Although he was a member of the Army ROTC, he resigned his commission and joined the Marine Corps as a second lieutenant. =World War II= During the attack on Pearl Harbor, Taplett was aboard the USS Salt Lake City which was not damaged during the assault. The Salt Lake City was one of only a handful of ships able to pursue the Japanese fleet. Taplett served on the ship for three years and participated in numerous campaigns in the Pacific Theater, including the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of the Aleutian Islands in 1943. After the war, Taplett, now a colonel, was assigned as the commanding officer of the navy supply barracks first at Clearview, Utah, and subsequently at Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay and at the Naval Air Station Alameda, California. =Korean War= Taplett was dispatched to Korea immediately after the outbreak of hostilities. He was made commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, and participated in numerous battles. His unit held the perimeter at Pusan and led the Inchon landing, taking Wolmi-do Island(Battle of Inchon), which was the gateway to Inchon. He led the 3rd Battalion through the gates of Seoul to liberate the South Korean State House. During the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, Taplett distinguished himself. From November 27 to December 10, 1950, he supported the strategic fallback of American forces, who were outnumbered by the Chinese nearly 5 to 1. Despite the severe cold and harsh weather, he and his men fought desperately to clear the road which allowed for escape from the reservoir. Of the roughly 1,300 men in his unit who began the fight, only 326 able-bodied Marines were left. For his leadership during the battle, Taplett was awarded the Navy Cross. =After the war= After the Korean War, he became the academic director of The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico in 1951 and 1952. From 1957 through 1959, he was based in Marine Corps Base Hawaii, although most of his time was spent training troops in Okinawa and the Philippines. Taplett was also a guest lecturer to various military units throughout the country speaking on the importance of close air support for ground troops. He retired from the Marine Corps in 1960, citing his displeasure with not being able to work directly with his troops and his military pay, which was not enough to support six children. =In retirement= Afterward, Taplett and his family moved to Arlington, Virginia, where he spent the rest of his life. He earned a masters degree from George Washington University in 1974. He joined the United States Postal Service and fully retired in 1993. He went back to visit Korea twice and eventually wrote a book, Darkhorse Six (2003), which chronicled his experiences in Korea.

Biography Wanda was born and raised in Inkster, Michigan. Originally aspiring to be a nurse, Young's professional music career started after fellow Inkster High School classmate Gladys Horton asked her to audition for a spot left by original Marvels member Georgia Dobbins. The Marvelettes After a successful audition, Young joined the group and the quintet, which had auditioned for a deal with Motown earlier, returned with a song written by Dobbins titled \\"Please Mr. Postman\\". In 1963, the Beatles recorded \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" on their second studio album With the Beatles. In 1975, the Carpenters' remake of \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" hit No. 1 around the world and was one of a dozen million-selling Gold-certified singles for the duo in the United States. It was also the second song to ever hit No. 1 by two different artists. Impressed with the group's sound, they were immediately signed and had their name changed to the Marvelettes and after the song was remastered, the song was released and became Motown's first No. 1 Pop single in late 1961—it also held the top slot for seven weeks on Billboard's R&B; chart. Young sang lead on the B-side of the single on a ballad, \\"So Long, Baby\\". While Young did occasionally sing leads on Marvelettes' album cuts, Horton was the main vocalist of the group for singles. Young sang co-lead on Marvelettes' songs, including singles \\"Locking Up My Heart\\" and \\"Too Many Fish in the Sea\\". In 1964, she sang her first (solo) lead on a Marvelettes' single, \\"You're My Remedy\\", which didn't translate as successfully to sales or charts figures. The first hit single to feature her on lead was the dance hit, \\"I'll Keep Holding On\\". From then on until the Marvelettes' departure, Young would be the main lead vocalist of the group. She went on to sing lead on several classics such as \\"Don't Mess with Bill\\" (a million-selling gold 45), \\"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\\", \\"When You're Young and in Love\\" and \\"My Baby Must Be a Magician\\". The Marvelettes' hit making days had waned by the end of the 1960s and in 1970 the group disbanded. In 1970, Wanda recorded a solo album with Smokey Robinson serving as her producer. Sensing marketing value as a Marvelettes release, Motown released the album as The Return of the Marvelettes. The other Marvelettes refused to participate for the album cover and the album flopped. Young left the label in 1972 when the Motown label relocated from Detroit to Los Angeles. Personal life On December 18, 1963, Young married her longtime boyfriend Bobby Rogers, a member of the Miracles, in Detroit and became known professionally as Wanda Rogers. The union produced two children; son Robert III and daughter Bobbae. Young and Rogers divorced in 1975 after 12 years of marriage, and she reverted to being known as Wanda Young. Life after the Marvelettes Young was involved with many years of substance abuse and alcoholism following the Marvelettes' departure, largely due to witnessing the shooting death of her sister at the Young family's Inkster residence. She re-emerged in the late 1980s after accepting an offer from Motorcity Records' Ian Levine to record new songs and revised versions of her classics with the Marvelettes. She made a brief return to performing in the early 1990s but without Marvelettes members Gladys Horton and Katherine Anderson. Katherine retired from show business after the Marvelettes' breakup though both Horton and Young collaborated on a Marvelettes recording for Motorcity Records. They released an album called The Marvelettes Now!, the artwork of which was modeled after their pink, 1967 album, and featured both Young and Horton on the cover. In 2002, Kanye West sampled Young's version of the Miracles' \\"After All\\" for Jay-Z's rap duet, \\"Poppin' Tags\\" from The Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse album, which featured Killer Mike, Big Boi and Twista. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame The Marvelettes were nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 2013 and again 2015.

The series takes place in the fictional Ginsei City, Japan, where a boy named Koshaku Chouno is creating alchemical monsters known as homunculi. During a night, Kazuki Muto, an ordinary boy, is killed by a homunculus, while trying to save Tokiko Tsumura. Feeling guilty, Tokiko, a member of the Alchemist Army, revives him by replacing his heart with an alchemical device called kakugane. The kakugane allows its wielder to form a buso renkin, a special weapon that is the only thing that can destroy a homunculus. With his own buso renkin, Kazuki decides to join Tokiko in the fight against the homunculi. Over the course of the series, they also must to defeat the L.X.E, a group consisting of human-type homunculi, as well as Victor, an entity most powerful than the homunculi. While developing the series, Watsuki was influenced by his previous works, mostly by Rurouni Kenshin from which he drew references to the main characters; Kazuki and Tokiko were conceptualized after Makimachi Misao and Himura Kenshin, respectively. Films such as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Brotherhood of the Wolf also served as source of inspiration, as well as American comics. Reviewers called the characters generic and also criticized their designs. The main characters divided critics' opinion; Kazuki and Papillon have received both praise and criticism, while most of praise was towards Tokiko, who also was voted as the most popular character of the series by readers. Creation and conception Watsuki based Buso Renkins characters and fictional elements on his previous works. He conceptualized Kazuki while imagining Makimachi Misao, and Tokiko was designed as a feminized version of Himura Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin. From the same series, Yukishiro Enishi and Yukishiro Tomoe served as inspiration for the Hayasaka twins; Inui Banjin and Otowa Hyōko for the homunculi Kinjo and Jinnai. Shusui Hayasaka's buso renkin, \\"Sword Samurai X\\", refers to the English name of Rurouni Kenshin. Watsuki declared that Buster Baron is a \\"reincarnation\\" of the Armor Baron from Gun Blaze West. In addition, Victor's buso renkin is named after the X-Men storyline of the same name. Watsuki has drawn many references from films. He choose the Kazuki's weapon as a lance because he watched A Knight's Tale, and thought it was \\"cool\\". Brotherhood of the Wolf served as the inspiration for Silver Skin, which is based on the main characters' outfit, and for Victor, which is based on a Native American. Moonface's replication ability is based in Matrixs Agent Smith. The name \\"League of Extraordinary Elects\\" was based on The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The submarine buso renkin was inspired by the Nautilus from Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. The term for the human followers of the homunculi, \\"familiars\\", comes from the human disciples of the vampires in Blade. Gekisen, the buso renkin of Genji Ikusabe was based on Hollow Man. Characters =Main characters= ; : :A 16-year-old boy who was killed by a homunculi when trying to save Tokiko Tsumura. When Tokiko replaces his heart with a buso renkin to revive him, he decides to help in the fight against the homunculi and is later asked to be an Alchemist Warrior by Captain Bravo, which he accepts due to his will to protect his sister Mahiro and his friends. His buso renkin is , a spear-lance; it has a cloth that turns into energy which allows to be used as propulsion or as a blinding light. ; : :A 17-year-old alchemic warrior. Seven year prior the series events, all the people in her school except for her are killed by homunculi, and she is rescued by Mamoru Sakimori. As such, she is serious almost all the time. The incident also left her with a scar, which could have been removed by using alchemy, but she decides to keep it as a reminder of her will to fight. Her buso renkin is , an execution scythe that attach to her thighs and is controlled via her synapses. ; : :A 19-year-old genius student. He is deathly ill with an unspecified disease, and learns about the process of making homunculi through research notes from his great- great-grandfather, experimenting with various animals first. Later, he turns himself into a human-type homunculus and renames himself . He kills all his family, but is subsequently killed by Kazuki. He is later revived by L.X.E., and wants to fight Kazuki once more; he is first prevented because he is still ill, and then because Kazuki is being chased by the Re-Extermination Squad. To prevent Kazuki's death, Papillon re-creates the white kakugane using Alexandra Powered's research. He and Kazuki finally have their showdown, but in the end he loses to Kazuki, who refuses to kill him again. His buso renkin is , a black gunpowder that can assume any form—it takes the form of butterfly wings as a reflection of his soul—and be detonated remotely. =The Alchemist Army= In the manga, with the exceptions of the three new members (Kazuki and the Hayasaka twins), all members of the Alchemist Army, including Tokiko, have their names annotated exclusively with katakana (e.g. ), while all other characters have theirs regularly with hiragana. Tokiko's family name, Tsumura, was annotated with hiragana (as ) for the first two volumes, however. ; : :His real name is and is Tokiko's commanding officer. He abandons his name after not being able to save all people in the Tokiko's school. Ordered by the Alchemist Army, he tries to kill Kazuki twice, as he fails in the first attempt, but he later defends Kazuki from Sekima Hiwatari, using his buso renkin to protect both of them.

Reception Leigh Dragoon of Sequential Tart qualified the characters as \\"completely forgettable\\" and said they lack of personality, citing Mahiro \\"could be portrayed as a piece of paper\\". Dragoon said Kazuki \\"seems like a direct lift from 3x3 Eyess Yakumo [Fujii]\\", and Tokiko and \\"Rei Ayanami without the interesting attached\\", respectively. Similarly, Michael Aronson from Manga Life stated \\"all [the characters] fit familiar roles\\". Later, Aronson named the character's dialogue as the series \\"strongest suit\\", but criticized how Kazuki and Tokiko \\"only act as bland foils\\". Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network (ANN) qualified Kazuki \\"a non- entity\\", and the remaining characters \\"human-shaped gags\\". Writing for ANN, Luke Carroll said the character designs are \\"a rather uninspired affair\\". Kimlinger said the designs are \\"so generic that they'd shame a dating sim\\". A reviewer of The Star declared \\"the manga's antagonists are quite weak and one- dimensional\\" and that it is \\"difficult to take Papillon Mask seriously.\\" In the same vein, Carlo Santos of ANN criticized the designs, mainly the villains who \\"slides right down into lame\\", saying \\"who would even want to cosplay Papillon?\\", and comparing Moonface to a scary McDonald's campaign. The \\"overblown\\" villains \\"soon start to become old hat\\" and \\"irritating\\", according to UK Anime Network's Andy Hanley. Although praised Papillon's backhistory, Mania's Chris Beveridge criticized his design and called him \\"a very quirky and weird character\\". Conversely, Patti Martinson wrote for Sequential Tart that the characters \\"are distinctive and interesting\\", and The Star reviewer called the character Buso Renkins \\"saving grace\\". Kazuki was said to be a \\"very likeable hero\\" by Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood, who also stated Papillon is the \\"most memorable\\" villain of the series. Carroll said Tokiko \\"is the best of the bunch\\", while Kimlinger, who praised her \\"an oasis of feminine strength in a genre more remarkable for its monster-bait femmes\\", declared it is one of few characteristics that distinguish the series from other shōnen fighting series. Active Anime's Sandra Scholes praised the character's illustration as well as called Kazuki and Tokiko \\"wonderful couple\\". Hanley said he only \\"feel a little empathy\\" for Kazuki and Tokiko in later episodes, while Beveridge praised Papillon taking \\"an amusing role\\" in those episodes. The supporting cast was also praised; Aronson cited there are \\"interesting personalities\\", while Beveridge said they \\"help it out immensely\\", and Kimlinger stated that they \\"so clearly outclassed its main character.\\" The addition of Re-Extermination Squad was praised by Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime who called they \\"interesting\\". At the end of the series, Ellingwood praised how Watsuki did \\"a fabulous job of covering [...] the various characters, juggling them effectively\\". In the Buso Renkin official popularity poll conducted by Weekly Shōnen Jump, Tokiko was elected the most popular among the manga fanbase. Kazuki ranked second, Papillon ranked third, Bravo ranked fourth, Shusui ranked fifth, Mahiro ranked sixth, Gouta ranked seventh, Angel Gouzen ranked eight, Ouka ranked ninhth, and Moonface ranked tenth. Two of the major villains, Victor and Dr. Butterfly, ranked 15th place and 19th place, respectively. Notes ;Notes References ;References ;Bibliography ;Buso Renkin manga volumes by Watsuki, Nobuhiro.

Start of the Belmont Stakes 2014 Horses leaving barrier stalls at the start of a Hong Kong Derby. A starting gate also called a starting barrier or starting stalls is a machine used to ensure a fair start to in horse racing and dog racing.  History  Throughout the history of horse racing, there have been proposals as to how better to start a race. A commonly used starting system for horse races was devised in the mid nineteenth century by Admiral Rous, a steward of the Jockey Club and public handicapper. A starter, standing alongside the jockeys and horses, dropped his flag to signal the start. An assistant some 100 yards down the course raised a second flag to indicate false starts. An official starter might be well paid, but his duties were very demanding. Early in the twentieth century, he was supported by perhaps a single assistant who primed the spring- barrier, as well as the clerk of the course. In the present day there are many attendants to steady runners from super-structured barrier stalls. A strand barrier start of a horse race in South Australia in 1952 The first horse racing starting barriers were simple ropes or occasionally wooden barriers behind which the horses stood. The first automated design was pioneered in Australia and was first used at an official race meeting in 1894. Alexander Gray had concluded that the flapping of a starter's flag distracted the horses. An impetus for his invention was a £5 fine received by his son, Reuben, a jockey, for allowing his mount to step over the white chalk line that marked the start. His machine was first tried out at Canterbury Park Racecourse in New South Wales in February 1894. Gray's prototype consisted of a single strand of wire at about the height of the horse's head that was attached to a spring at either end. When the device was activated the barrier sprang up and away from the horses. Gray's single-strand barrier was among those first used. Versions of barriers designed by Alexander and Reuben Gray were installed at race tracks in Australia and overseas between 1894 and about 1932. By the 1920s the single strand barrier had evolved into a spring-powered five-strand device designed by Johnstone and Gleeson, but based on Gray's prototype, that resembled a strongman's chest expander. Barriers assured fair starts to races. Fair race starts encouraged owners to enter horses in races and punters to bet, and they contributed to changing horse racing from a social sporting event into a billion dollar industry. The inventor of the electric starting gate for horse racing is Clay Puett, who was a rider and starter at various tracks in the American West. Puett's device replaced other starting methods which often failed to produce a fair start, with extra judges employed to catch horses who got a jump on the rest of the field. A transportable starting machine was imported from the United States to Australia in 1946. It wasn't until 1965 that starting stalls were introduced by the Jockey Club to horseracing in the United Kingdom. 10 years ago the European manufacturer Fornells SA ( HORSE RACING ) designed a new kind of starting gate. When the starting gates developed in USA are considered very robust it is obvious that the size and weight of this kind of starting gate are very heavy and very long. It is not adapted for many turf tracks. \\" we are supplying racetrack for more than 40 years and we have been asked constantly by the racecourses if we could design a new starting gates adapted to wet weather and turf tracks where rails needs to be moved. 1O years ago we finally had our first starting gates manufactured and supplied to answer it \\" said David Maizeret, Fornells' CEO. The cost of the maintenance of the turf tracks and the changing in the horse racing industry revenues encourage racecourse management to investigate for new solutions. The international authorities in Ireland HRI, France galop, Morocco SOREC or Saudi Arabia The Equestrian club of Riyadh ( SAUDI CUP ) for instance have now adopted this new generation of starting gates. They was looking for a best economical solution, safe for the horses and jockeys, light to keep the track in good shape and very quiet. But over all, the horse racing industry is now looking for a safe start as the betting is a key point. The new generation answer to this needs. \\" Fornells' opening system has been developed to guarantee the most efficient start with easy maintenance and maximum reliability \\" says Georges Indrian Jafy, Doctor in sciences and director of Fornells' design office. The improvements to be made and the new developments to come are going to be faster in the coming years in an industry who is in his most important changing period of his history. Flat horse racing Starting gate detail, looking in from front to back Many of Puett's actual gates are still in use today at tracks around the world, and all gates are based on his original design. A starting gate is equipped with a number of stalls aligned in a row, usually numbering 12 or 14 for everyday use at tracks. Smaller gates may be used at training facilities for schooling horses, or as an auxiliary gate in addition to the main gate for large-field races such as the Kentucky Derby. The gates are suspended from an overhead welded steel truss, supported at each end by wheels with pneumatic tires. The entire structure is designed to be towed behind a tractor or truck, so that it can be moved about on the racetrack grounds, or towed over highways from place to place.See, e.g., . Horses normally enter from the rear of the stall, with gates locked behind the horse once it is in place; the front gates of the stall are normally closed as the horse is loaded in, though the starting-gate crew may open it in order to entice a horse who balks at entry. Alternately, a horse may be backed into the stall from the front entry, again done in the case of a skittish horse. A Woodbine Racetrack starting gate, backside. The front door of each stall is held closed by an electromagnetic lock. The stall doors are designed to give way in case a horse prematurely attempts to bolt through the front or back, in order to reduce or prevent injury to horse or rider. When the starter is satisfied that all horses are in place and ready to start the race, he presses a button, cutting the electric current, simultaneously opening the front stall doors, ringing a loud bell, and sending a signal to the totalizator system that the race is begun and no more bets should be accepted. Puett's gate was first used at Exhibition Park in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1939, though the management of Bay Meadows Racetrack in San Mateo, California claims that their track was the first to use Puett's gate.BayMeadows.com: Bay Meadows history , accessed 2008-06-06] By the end of 1940, virtually all major race tracks in the United States used Puett gates. Clay Puett began another company, True Center Gate, in 1958 based in Phoenix, Arizona. True Center and Puett's original company (first known as Puett Electric Gate company, now as United) currently account for most starting gate installations in North America. True Center also has gates in South America, the Caribbean and Saudi Arabia. While starting gates are standard for flat racing, steeplechase tracks frequently still use earlier forms of starting barriers. Harness racing A mobile starting barrier used to begin an 8-horse heat. In cases where there are more horses, they will be arranged in a row directly after the first line horses One of the reasons that harness racing was less popular than horse racing has been the reservations in gamblers’ minds about the various means of starting trotting races, particularly when bets have been lost before contests were properly under way. Before mobile starting gates gained popularity in harness racing, a rolling start was used. The horses were driven in a number of circles, and the manoeuvre, if carried out correctly, arranged the horses in lines. The fairness of the start was judged by stewards at the starting line; if they judged that a racer was not fairly in line with the others, a false start would be called and the race would start again. This process was sometimes repeated several times before a fair start occurred. In the middle 20th Century, the mobile starting gate was developed. Most harness races now start from behind a motorized starting gate, called a \\"car start\\" or \\"auto start\\". This device consists of a car or pickup truck equipped with a hinged gate that resembles metal \\"wings\\" on each side of the vehicle. As the vehicle is driven down the center of the track, the wings are extended and the horses line up in order behind it. When the gate reaches the starting line, the starter retracts the wings, which fold inward toward the vehicle body. The vehicle then accelerates away from the horses and pulls off to the outside to let the racers proceed; it many cases, it then follows close behind the racers for officials to view the race and any potential infractions of rules. The modern starting gate uses a driver for steering the vehicle while the starter sits in the rear to concentrate on the actual horses positioning during the \\"score up\\". The starter will also observe the race and call a false start if required. The motorized gate drastically reduced the number of false starts, but did not eliminate them. If the starter, who rides in the vehicle facing backward toward the horses, sees that the start is not fair in some way, he may issue a recall and order the race to be started again. Today, the start speed, acceleration, score up distance, and gate closing are controlled via a computer system, which takes control of the vehicle and provides a printout at the end of the score up. The other kind of start to race is a standing start, where there are tapes across the track and the horses stand stationary behind the tapes before the start. This enables handicaps to be placed on horses according to class. Some European, Australian and New Zealand races start using tapes. Dog racing Greyhound racing uses a device similar in nature and concept to the horse racing starting gate. The machine is usually called a starting box, owing to its use of boxes to hold the greyhounds in place. Dogs are loaded from the rear, with a small window in the front door through which the dog can see the track and the mechanical lure. Once the lure has come around to a point a few meters behind the box, it passes a sensor which trips a switch to release the gates which swing upward to open, releasing the dogs. The opening gates start the race clock. Unlike horse racing, this action does not signal the totalizator system to end betting; that is done instead by a steward just before the lure is sent on its way. Starting boxes normally hold eight dogs, with some holding nine.

The station is owned by El Dorado Broadcasters and airs a Top 40/CHR music format. The KZXY-FM studios are located in the city of Victorville. History =KAVR-FM/KAPV= The station first signed on 17 May 1968 as KAVR-FM. Owned by BHA Enterprises, it was the FM sister station to KAVR (960 AM) and broadcast a middle of the road music format. On 15 September 1972, BHA Enterprises sold KAVR-AM-FM to Phoenix Broadcasters Corporation Ltd. for $423,750. Gerald F. Hicks, president of BHA, held a 4.7% interest in the purchasing party. However, on 11 October 1973, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) blocked the transaction and scheduled a hearing on whether the stations' licenses should be revoked, citing Hicks' obtaining a majority of BHA's stock without FCC approval. On 5 November 1974, an administrative law judge recommended the revocation of BHA's licenses to the stations. In December 1981, KAVR-FM changed its call sign to KAPV. The station reverted to the original KAVR-FM call letters in September 1985. =KZXY-FM= In October 1987, BHA Enterprises Ltd., now controlled by Dick Schofield, sold KAVR-AM-FM to Crown Broadcasting, owned by Ron Strother, for $1.7 million. At the time, the FM station carried a country music format. The FCC approved the transfer of licenses on 18 December. The new owner, also known as Ruby Broadcasting and controlled by Tom Gammon, changed KAVR-FM's call sign to KZXY-FM in June 1988. In December 1997, Regent Communications purchased KZXY-FM, its longtime AM sister station now called KIXW, and KIXA from Ruby Broadcasting for $8 million. In April 2000, Clear Channel Communications proposed a complex station swap with Regent Communications which would have involved 20 stations nationwide, including KZXY-FM, and a payment of over $67 million by Regent to Clear Channel. This deal was one of many divestitures required of Clear Channel and AMFM, Inc. by the FCC as a condition of their merger, in order to satisfy ownership caps in each affected media market. While this exchange was not implemented fully, Clear Channel did acquire the adult contemporary-formatted KZXY-FM and its AM sister station KIXW. From 2001 to 2002, KZXY and its hot adult contemporary music format were simulcast on sister KYHT (105.3 FM) in Yermo, California; together, the two stations were branded as \\"Y 102 & 105\\". In June 2007, Clear Channel sold 16 stations in California and Arizona, including KZXY-FM, to El Dorado Broadcasters for $40 million. Syndicated programming on KZXY-FM includes The John Tesh Radio Show and American Top 40 hosted by Ryan Seacrest.

He was born in Obory near Dobříš. During World War I Balabán joined the Czechoslovak Legions in Russia. Later, he served as an artillery officer in the Czechoslovak Army, then as a staff officer and at the Ministry of Defense (reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel). After Germany occupied the remainder of Czech lands in March 1939, Balabán started to cooperate with the resistance group Obrana národa (Defense of the nation) that had been organized by former army officers. Beginning in the summer of 1939 he was one of the leaders of the organization. Together with Josef Mašín and Václav Morávek, Balabán was part of the group known as the Three Kings (Tři králové), which carried out intelligence gathering and sabotage. The group continued in communication with Paul Thümmel (agent A-54), a Nazi intelligence officer also working as a spy for Czechoslovakia. The most visible acts of sabotage were two bomb attacks carried out in Berlin: one in January 1941 against the Ministry of Air Travel (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) and police headquarters, and the second in February 1941 in the Berlin-Anhalt rail station, which was intended to kill Heinrich Himmler. On 22 April 1941 the Gestapo captured Balabán in Prague after a brief gunfight. In spite of being tortured he didn't disclose any information about the resistance. After Reinhard Heydrich assumed the position of Deputy Reichsprotektor (September 1941), martial law was established and Balabán was sentenced to death. He was executed in Ruzyně Prison in Prague on 3 October. Literature * Petr Koura: Podplukovník Josef Balabán.

Function Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the posttranslational modification of vitamin K-dependent proteins. Many of these vitamin K-dependent proteins are involved in coagulation so the function of the encoded enzyme is essential for hemostasis. Most gla domain-containing proteins depend on this carboxylation reaction for posttranslational modification. In humans, the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase enzyme is most highly expressed in the liver. Catalytic reaction Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase oxidizes Vitamin K hydroquinone to Vitamin K 2,3 epoxide, while simultaneously adding CO2 to protein-bound glutamic acid (abbreviation = Glu) to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (also called gamma-carboxyglutamate, abbreviation = Gla). Presence of two carboxylate groups causes chelation of Ca2+ , resulting in change in tertiary structure of protein and its activation.

He was born in Chocnějovice, a municipality in the Mladá Boleslav District of the Kingdom of Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) on May 13, 1904. Rechcigl was an active member of the Agrarian Party in Czechoslovakia before the World War II. In 1935 he was elected to the Czechoslovak Parliament as its youngest member. In this capacity, he devoted his energies to economic problems, and served on several committees, relating to agriculture, industry and commerce, and international relations.Ottuv slovník naucný nové doby.

He was a reporter for trade agreements for a number of countries, and for agricultural trade issues, in general. The occupation of the country by the Nazis interrupted Rechcigl's political career. In spite of his active involvement in the underground resistance movement against the Nazis, as a non-communist political figure he became a target of persecution after the Communist takeover in 1948.Miloslav Rechcigl, Sr. (1904-1973). Papers, http://www.ihrc.umn.edu/about/pr/dec17-02.html Obituaries: in Denni Hlasatel (Chicago), May 31, 1973; also in Washington Post and Herald Tribune After two failed attempts by the Secret Police to arrest him while he was hospitalized with a serious illness, he illegally crossed the border to Germany in May 1948. After some time in a Displaced persons camp in Germany, he went to Paris, where he became a member of the Executive Committee of the Council of Free Czechoslovakia. In February 1950, he arrived in the United States, where, after several years of manual work in New York City, he joined Radio Free Europe as chief editor of the Czechoslovak agricultural program. In 1956 he was transferred from New York to Munich, Germany. In 1970, he returned to the United States, where he died as a US naturalized citizen in Washington, D.C. on May 27, 1973. Before entering the political scene, he operated a family flour mill in his native village, which he managed for his father from the age of 22, upon graduating from the Prague commercial academy. Two years later he assumed ownership of the mill and independently managed it, together with the adjacent farm. Since 1928, he worked in various professional organizations of millers, including the Millers’ Association, Trade Millers’ Alliance of Czechoslovakia, Czech Territorial Union of Millers and the Central Union of Millers in Czechoslovakia of which he became executive secretary. He also founded the Millers’ Cooperative and became its vice president. In 1938, through his initiative, the supreme organization of Czechoslovak millers was established under the name Central Office of Czechoslovak Millers and he became its president.Ceskoslovenský biografický slovník.

The history of worship in India is one of hybridisation. In ancient times various regions each had their own local myths and folklore, worshipping their own collection of local spirits and deities. Repeated invasions from the north as well as a vast expansion of trade with the west such as Siraf and with China to the east, brought increased contact with other cultures. India prospered through trade beginning in the days of the Roman Empire. An indicator of the Indian merchants' importance in Siraf comes from records describing dining plates reserved for them.Sastri (1955), p302 Over time a process of cultural accommodation occurred and the local pantheons of spirits were merged with the foreign. The origin of the major Hindu deities, Vishnu, Shiva, and the various forms of the female consorts or goddess such as Shakti and Durga and the history of their possible converging or merging is not reliably documented. It is likely that in this way, for example, Vishnu collected his long list of Avatars or bodily manifestations. This accounts for the wide range in their divine powers and their rich and contradictory personalities. History Lord Shiva The history of devotional movements is as ancient as that of the worship of the significant deities. While Hinduism is often described as having 30,000 gods in its pantheon, from an anthropological and historical perspective the most significant devotional movements of the past two thousand years have centered on only a few. But together with these significant gods are thousands of gods arising from ancient customs and beliefs. There are household gods, village gods, gods of the forests and mountains, agricultural gods, and regional deities. The movements of some of these deities are as ancient as those of the primary gods, and the devotees of these deities often have intertwined histories and practices. In trying to account for the large number of Pandyan rock-cut temples built between 650 and 835 A.D. art historian K.V.Soundara Rajan attributes this proliferation to the \\"insistent demand of cult groups\\". However, the history of Hinduism is most closely tied to the parallel creation of two major groups, that of Shiva and Vishnu, each made up of an amalgamation of many minor deities. The Divine Mother or the Goddess, Shakti often shown in the aspect of Durga, is a third major group. Most Hindus allied themselves with one of the three major groups while not denying the existence of the others. The simultaneous development of these Hindu groups seemed primarily peaceful with little documentation of friction or persecution, as the general belief was that the group deities were different aspects of the divine and all led to the same goal whatever the specific practices (Moksha). Form Brooklyn Museum - Devotional Discourse ca.1750-1775 More important in daily life of many Hindus than the major deities are the many ancient minor deities of folklore that control more practical concerns, the pantheon of folk demi- gods and spirits such as the yakshas and yakshini and their king Kubera who regulates such matters as fertility and wealth, and mythical beings such as apsaras, water nymphs associated with good fortune, sacred waters and other natural elements who entertain the gods in heaven. Worship is the common form of Hindu devotion. However, many other forms are commonly practiced, including pilgrimage, festival procession, and healing bathing at sacred sites. Hindu devotional modes of expression are devotional poetry, mythology, art and iconography. See also * Bhakti * Vahana Notes  References  * Dhanul Kottagodage, D.L.K. (1955).

The Headquarters of the association is at Thiruvananthapuram. Prof. K. A. Isaac was the patron of the association. The association has boldly voiced the sentiments and the views of professionals on several occasions to the concerned authorities. It has successfully projected the need for improving library services in College & Universities. KLA helped the Government to formulate policies in relation to library development in the state.  Origin  The first attempt at founding a professional association took place in 1958 by the initiative of a few trained librarians who formed the All Kerala College Librarians Association. In 1961, the University of Kerala opened a new department to offer bachelor's degree in Library science. Subsequently, when the number of degree holders began to increase, it led to the formation of another association called Kerala Librarians Association in 1964 at Thiruvananthapuram. Later in 1971 the present association was renamed as Kerala Library Association, and thus it was registered under the Societies Registration Act and it became the first legitimate organization of the professional librarians in the state of Kerala.

More than half of Cuiba speakers are monolingual, and in Colombia there is a 45% literacy rate. Cuiva is also referred to as Cuiba, Cuiba-Wámonae, Kuiva, Chiricoa, Hiwi, and Maiben. In Colombia, Cuiva is spoken among those who live and who are born surrounding the Colombian rivers, Meta Casanare and Capanaparo. The Cuiba ethnic group is often found in the Casanare region. In Venezuela the language is spoken in the state of Apure, one of the state border with Colombia, which is found alongside the Capanaparo river. History of Cuiba The term Cuiba is usually used to describe the ethnic group itself, although they do not refer to themselves as Cuiba. Most of those who speak the Cuiba language are monolingual, which is why the language is threatened seeing as the ethnic population itself is only approximately 2,950 and continues to decrease. The Cuiba ethnic group are characterized as being hunter-gatherers, who live a nomadic lifestyle in small bands along the borders of Colombia and Venezuela. Before 1967, the Cuiba were spread across the Meta rivers: Casanare, Agua Clara, Ariporo, Unchadia, Arauca, and Capanaparo. For the most part although the groups of Cuiba today are much smaller, they continue to occupy what is left of the areas around the rivers. The banks of the Casanare, Agua Clara, Ariporo, Unchadia, Arauca, and Capanaparo are for the most part known as Cuiba territory and there has been no evidence stating that the Cuiba have occupied other territory but their own. The Cuiba have gone through many wars and invasions, which have slightly influenced Cuiba political and cultural practices at some point. Although the Europeans have left, some Spanish words survived. There is no evidence showing where the Spanish words were originated. There have been many attempts after 1533 invasion attempting to remove the Cuiba from their territory, but although the Cuiba have a small population their culture has largely remained unchanged.

He often undertook a documentary style of filmmaking within narrative works, and frequently employs contemporary Iranian poetry in dialogue, movie titles, and in the thematic elements of his pictures. The Kiarostamian style Though Abbas Kiarostami has been compared to Satyajit Ray, Vittorio de Sica, Eric Rohmer, and Jacques Tati, his films exhibit a singular style, often employing techniques of his own invention (the so-called \\"Kiarostamian style\\"). During the filming of The Bread and Alley, his first film, Kiarostami disagreed with his experienced cinematographer about how to film the boy and the attacking dog. The cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a close up of his hand as he enters the house and closes the door, followed by a shot of the dog. Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact, creating tension. That one shot took some forty days to complete. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes can disrupt the rhythm and content of the film's structure, stating he prefers to let the scene flow as one. Unlike other directors he showed no interest in developing his directorial muscles by staging extravagant combat scenes or complicated chase scenes in large-scale productions. Instead, he attempted to use the medium of film in his own unique way. As he quoted in relation to his cinematographer's perspective on filming: \\"I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to\\". Kiarostami appeared to have settled on his style when he made the Koker trilogy. Nevertheless, he continued experimenting with new modes of filming, using different directorial methods. Much of Ten, for example, was filmed in a moving automobile without Kiarostami present. He gave suggestions to the actors about what to do, and a camera placed on the dashboard then filmed them while they drove around Tehran.The Mac Weekly:With liberty for all: the films of Kiarostami The camera was allowed to roll, capturing the faces of the people during their daily routine, using a series of extreme close-up shots. Kiarostami's cinema offers a different definition of film. According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami, unlike many other contemporary filmmakers Kiarostami has consistently attempted to redefine film by forcing the audience's increased involvement. In recent years he has also progressively trimmed down the size of his films, which Akrami believes reduces the film making experience from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression. As Kiarostami quoted in relation to his individual style of minimalism: > My films have been progressing towards a certain kind of minimalism, even > though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been > eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the > paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted > while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's > something that we do – we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.Jean- > Luc Nancy, \\"On Evidence: Life and Nothing More, by Abbas Kiarostami,\\" > Discourse 21.1 (1999), p.82. Also, cf., . Self-referencing is a feature specific to Kiarostami's cinema. Stephen Bransford contends that Kiarostami's films do not contain references to the work of other directors, but do include a myriad of references to his own work. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic: one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film. Fiction and non-fiction Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often mix fiction and documentary elements. As Kiarostami has said, \\"We can never get close to the truth except through lying.\\" Kiarostami has said of his film making: \\"An artist designs and creates a piece hoping to materialize some thoughts, concepts or feelings through his or her medium. The credibility of great Persian poets like Rumi and Hafez comes from the very fact that they are composed in such a way that they are fresh and meaningful regardless of the time, place and conditions in which you read them—and this means reading them while doing divination or simply as literature.\\" The boundary between fiction and non-fiction is significantly reduced in Kiarostami's cinema. The French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, writing about Kiarostami, and in particular Life, and Nothing More..., has argued that his films are neither quite fiction nor quite documentary. Life and Nothing More..., he argues, is neither representation nor reportage, but rather \\"evidence\\": > [I]t all looks like reporting, but everything underscores (indique à > l'évidence) that it is the fiction of a documentary (in fact, Kiarostami > shot the film several months after the 1990 earthquake), and that it is > rather a document about \\"fiction\\": not in the sense of imagining the unreal, > but in the very specific and precise sense of the technique, of the art of > constructing images. For the image by means of which, each time, each opens > a world and precedes himself in it (s'y prédède) is not pregiven (donnée > toute faite) (as are those of dreams, phantasms or bad films): it is to be > invented, cut and edited. Thus it is evidence, insofar as, if one day I > happen to look at my street on which I walk up and down ten times a day, I > construct for an instant a new evidence of my street.Jean-Luc Nancy, \\"On > Evidence: Life and Nothing More, by Abbas Kiarostami,\\" Discourse 21.1 > (1999), p.82. Also, cf., Jean Luc Nancy. Is Cinema Renewing Itself? Film- > Philosophy. vol. 6 no. 15, July 2002. Close-Up, for example, contains scenes from the real-life trial of a man charged with fraudulently impersonating a film director. To make the film, however, Kiarostami coaxed the antagonists to re-stage scenes occurring between them, including the arrest. While such a technique clearly precludes labeling the film as a documentary, by re-staging events between the deceiver and the deceived Kiarostami implicitly poses questions about the validity and significance of what the audience sees. Because these are the actual participants in a drama played out in criminal court, it dawns on the audience that these re-stagings are also part of the real life of these people, especially since both the impersonator and the family he fooled were interested in working in cinema. If these re-enactments constitute a kind of \\"evidence\\", this is less because they show us what took place to cause the arrest than because the audience is witness to a scene in which the actors are in fact continuing the story of their confrontation and/or reconciliation. For Jean-Luc Nancy, this notion of cinema as \\"evidence,\\" rather than as documentary or imagination, is tied to the way Kiarostami deals with life and death: > Existence resists the indifference of life and death, it lives beyond > mechanical \\"life,\\" it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It > becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is > presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the > objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, for me, is the very > thought of this film [Life and Nothing More...]—is a difficult thought, > perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a > path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images > so that images become this thought, so that they become the evidence of this > thought—and not in order to \\"represent\\" it.Jean-Luc Nancy, \\"On Evidence: > Life and Nothing More, by Abbas Kiarostami,\\" Discourse 21.1 (1999), p.85–6. Wanting to do more than just represent life and death as an opposition, and instead to show the way in which each is inevitably and profoundly involved with the other, Kiarostami has devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the documentable \\"facts,\\" but neither is it simply a matter of artifice. Because \\"existence\\" means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this \\"being more than\\" life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving an interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying is the only way to truth. Themes of life and death Themes of life and death and the concepts of change and continuity play a major role in Kiarostami's works. In the Koker trilogy, for example, we see an ongoing life force in the face of death and destruction, and the power of human resilience to overcome and defy death. The film is set in the aftermath of the 1990 Tehran earthquake. Kiarostami expressed how important these themes are in his films, particularly in the film Life, and Nothing More..., directed soon after the disaster: > It is a very important film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was > filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an > earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the > experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 > people had died. For the survivors, it was as if they were reborn, having > experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five > in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was > almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a > film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned > to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and > death from then on does recur in my films. The theme of suicide is also important in several of his earlier films. He shows how the desire to self-harm is often counteracted by humanity and the need to help others in the face of death. This illustrates the ongoing life force and the power of life over death. Taste of Cherry explores the fragility of life and rhetorically focuses on the preciousness of life. Badii, a middle aged apparently healthy and well off Tehrani (played by Homayoun Ershadi), cruises the city's outskirts in his Range Rover trying to find a stranger who will help him commit suicide. Conversations with people on the way gradually convince him of the positivity and preciousness of life. From the young Kurdish soldier who is spooked by the shuddering request to a middle-aged Afghani seminarian who is unable to dissuade Badii with religious sympathy to a Turkish taxidermist at a natural history museum who urges the glories of nature — the taste of cherries — as the prime reason not to kill oneself, Kiarostami evokes a high degree of emphasis on the different elements of life. When the protagonist reaches his grave, a black screen evokes his symbolic death, but the finality of this ending is undermined by the video sequences that follow, which show the actor playing Mr. Badiei lighting a cigarette and the film crew resting. Again, life goes on, but in an off-screen elsewhere. Symbols of death proliferate throughout The Wind Will Carry Us with scenes set in a graveyard, the imminence of the old woman's passing, and the ancestors that the character of Farzad mentions in an early scene. Such devices ask the viewer to consider the parameters of the afterlife and the concept of immaterial existence. In the film's opening sequence, Behzad tells Farzad that like people, cars have ghosts. This becomes the theme of the work and the subject of the film — they are waiting for the old woman to give up the ghost. The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to the soul after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami stated that his function is that of one who raises questions, rather than answers them. Kiarostami affirms that the audience must decide for themselves. Some film critics believe that the assemblage of light versus dark scenes in Kiarostami's film grammar in Taste of Cherry and The Wind Will Carry Us suggests the mutual existence of life with its endless possibilities and death as a factual moment of anyone's life. When the leading actor in The Wind Will Carry Us enters the dark he recites a poem by Forough Farrokhzad that represents his nostalgic yearning for light and life in a dark, dead moment: > If you happen to come to my house, oh dear, bring a lamp for me; and a > window so that I can watch the crowd in the happy street. Regarding Kiarostami's ABC Africa made in Kampala in 2001 during the AIDS epidemic, Geoff Andrew stated that \\"like his previous four features, this film is not about death but life-and-death: how they're linked, and what attitude we might adopt with regard to their symbiotic inevitability...\\"Jean-Luc Nancy, \\"On Evidence: Life and Nothing More, by Abbas Kiarostami,\\" Discourse 21.1 (1999), p.82. Visual and audio techniques thumb Kiarostami's style is notable for the use of long shots, such as in the closing sequences of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments. This relationship between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is also present in the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical relationship between image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding its way through the mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film's protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of presence without presence manipulates our perception of nature and space in the geographical framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasises the shrinking of time and space and the interconnectedness of the modern world. Film critic Ben Zipper believes that Kiarostami's work as a landscape artist is evident in the composition of distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films. He points out that Kiarostami's use of rural locations and remote settings is reminiscent of Sohrab Sepehri’s attention to landscape as represented in his poems such as Golestaneh, in which the poet treats the rural environment realistically and imbues it with a poetic aura. Poetry and imagery Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland discusses how one aspect of Kiarostami's cinematic style is that he is able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.From Kinetic Poetics to a Poetic Cinema: Abbas Kiarostami and the Esthetics of Persian Poetry, Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak, University of Maryland (2005)] In 2003, Kiarostami directed Five, a poetic feature that contained no dialogue or characterisation whatsoever. The movie consists of five single-take long shots of the natural landscape along the shores of the Caspian Sea. Although the film lacks a clear storyline, Geoff Andrew argues that the film is \\"more than just pretty pictures\\": \\"assembled in order, they comprise a kind of abstract or emotional narrative arc, which moves evocatively from separation and solitude to community, from motion to rest, near-silence to sound and song, light to darkness and back to light again, ending on a note of rebirth and regeneration.\\"Geoff Andrew, Ten, (London: BFI Publishing, 2005), pp. 73–4. He notes the degree of artifice concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery as everyday moments are captured. A piece of driftwood is tossed and broken by the waves; people stroll along the promenade; a group of dogs gather by the water's edge whilst ducks strut across the frame. A pool of water is shot at night with the sounds of a storm, and frogs croaking break the stillness. An aspect of Abbas Kiarostami's artistry that eludes those unfamiliar with Persian poetry and that has therefore remained inaccessible to many is the way he turns poetic images into cinematic ones. This is most obvious in those Kiarostami films that recall specific texts of Persian poetry more or less explicitly (including in their titles): Where's the Friend's Home? and The Wind will Carry Us. The characters recite poems mainly from classical Persian poet Omar Khayyám or modern Persian poets Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad. One of the most poetic moments in Wind Will Carry Us is a long shot of a wheat field with rippling golden crops through which the doctor, accompanied by the filmmaker, is riding his scooter down a twisting road. In response to his comment that the other world is a better place than this one, the doctor recites this poem of Khayyam: > They promise of houris in heaven But I would say wine is better Take the > present to the promises A drum sounds melodious from afar However, the aesthetic involved with the poetry goes much farther back in time and is used much more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.From Kinetic Poetics to a Poetic Cinema: Abbas Kiarostami and the Esthetics of Persian Poetry Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak, University of Maryland, College Park (MD) Sima Daad from the Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Washington feels that the creative merit of Kiarostami's adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad's poems extends the domain of textual transformation. Adaptation is defined as the transformation of a prior text to a new text. Kiarostami's adaptation arrives at theoretical realm of adaptation by expanding its limit from inter-textual potential to trans- generic potential. Spirituality Kiarostami's complex sound-images and philosophical approach have caused frequent comparisons with mystical filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson. Irrespective of substantial cultural differences, much of western writing about Kiarostami positions him as the Iranian equivalent of such directors, by virtue of universal austere, spiritual poetics and moral commitment. Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami's films with that of Sufi concepts. Kiarostami's films often reflect upon immaterial concepts such as the soul and afterlife. At times, however, the very concept of the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art. Asked in a 2000 Film Comment interview if there are any other directors who might be working on a \\"similar wavelength\\", Kiarostami pointed to Hou Hsiao-hsien as one. He said, > \\"Tarkovsky's works separate me completely from physical life, and are the > most spiritual films I have seen — what Fellini did in parts of his movies, > bringing dream life into film, he does as well. Theo Angelopoulos' movies > also find this type of spirituality at certain moments. In general, I think > movies and art should take us away from daily life, should take us to > another state, even though daily life is where this flight is launched > from.\\" Differing viewpoints have arisen in this debate. While the vast majority of English-language writers, such as David Sterritt and Spanish film professor Alberto Elena, interpret these films as spiritual films, critics including David Walsh and Hamish Ford disagree. Kiarostami and digital micro cinema At the turn of the 21st century, Kiarostami decided to change from 35 mm film production to digital video. The first film where he used this technology was ABC Africa, which was compiled from footage shot with two small digital video cameras, material originally gathered for the purposes of research and scouting. Referring to digital cinema Kiarostami said: \\"Digital video is within the reach of anybody, like a ballpoint pen. I'd even dare to predict that within the next decade, we'll see a burst of interest in film-making as a consequence of the impact of video\\". Kiarostami stated about the documentary ABC Africa that \\"directing was spontaneously and unconsciously eliminated, by which I mean artificial and conventional directing.\\" Abbas Kiarostami's film Ten (2002) was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. Kiarostami fastened cameras to the dashboard of a car, and then allowed his actors to act. There was no film crew in the car, and no director. There is no camera movement, other than the movement of the car which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing. This new direction is towards a digital micro cinema, defined as micro-budget filmmaking allied with digital production.Ganz, A. & Khatib, L. (2006) \\"Digital Cinema: The transformation of film practice and aesthetics\\" in New Cinemas, vol. 4 no 1, pp 21–36 Modularity, Repetition and Variation in \\"Ten (2000)\\" According to filmmaker Matthew Clayfield, Kiarostami's work with digital video may be more valuable to cinema than it is to post-cinema, but it also proves that virtually anyone with a camera can contribute to the art form in ways that were previously impossible. In 2005, Kiarostami directed a workshop on digital film-making at the London Film School, in which he expressed reservations about digital cinema. \\"My film 10 is a couple of years old now,\\" explains Kiarostami to film students, \\"and today I'm not so fascinated by digital technology. [...] recently it has become clear to me just how few people actually know how to use it properly.\\" He also stated: \\"I have somewhat lost my enthusiasm [for digital video] in the last four or five years. Mainly because film students using digital video these days have not really produced anything more than superficial or simplistic; so I have my doubts. Despite the great advantages of digital video and the great ease of using the medium, still those who use it have first to understand the sensitivities of how to best use the medium.\\" See also * Film genre * Abbas Kiarostami filmography * French New Wave * Iranian New Wave * Italian neorealism References Secondary literature Books:  Rice, Julian (2020).

The river continues over a series of cascades for approximately 1/4 mile past the falls, where the stream loses approximately 300 ft (100 m) in elevation. Natural history The falls are in South Mountains State Park, which is owned and operated by the State of North Carolina. The South Mountains, carved out of the Blue Ridge by erosion, are a broad belt of peaks and knobs rising abruptly from a deep valley. These steep, rugged mountains encompass 100,000 acres (400 km²) in Burke, Cleveland and Rutherford counties. Water winding through the park to the Catawba River cuts deep into the terrain, forming rugged and steep slopes. Funds to purchase the falls and park were appropriated in 1974. Visiting the falls The falls is located at South Mountains State Park in North Carolina. There are many trails through the state park, and the most popular is the High Shoals Falls Loop Trail. Visitors are encouraged to stay on the trail. Absolutely no swimming is permitted near the falls, as deaths and injuries have occurred through the years, primarily to people who swim at the top of the falls. Four people have died at High Shoals Falls since 1993, including a 17-year-old who fell to his death on June 14, 2011.http://www2.morganton.com/news/2011/jun/14/6/man-dies-after-falling- falls-ar-1121463/ Nearby falls Jacob's Fork River has several small cascades both upstream and downstream from High Shoals Falls.

He compiled a tonarius, dealing with the organisation of the church chants into ‘tones’ – eight modes of the Gregorian chant. Following the reforms initiated under Abbot Immo, who imposed the Benedictine rule at Reichenau, under Berno's enlightened guidance the abbey reached its peak as a centre of learning, with a productive scriptorium, as a centre of Bendictine monasticism and eleventh-century liturgical and musical reforms in the German churches.Hartmut Möller, \\"Zur Reichenauer Offiziumstradition der Jahrtausendwende\\" Studia Musicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 29.1/4 (1987), pp. 35-61. At Reichenau he erected the tall western tower and transept that stand today on the island site of Reichenau-Mittelzell.The monograph on the constructions and reconstructions at Reichenau is Alfons Zettler, Die Frühen Klosterbauten der Reichenau: Ausgrabungen-Schriftquellen—St. Galler Klosterplan (Sigmaringen) 1988. One of his most famous students was Hermann of Reichenau, who transmitted Arabic mathematics and astronomy to central Europe. Politically the abbot cleaved to his patrons Henry and to Henry III, duke of Bavaria and eventually Emperor, and wrote many letters and missives to the Hungarian kings Saint Stephen I of Hungary and Peter Orseolo of Hungary, containing various historical information about the Hungarian kingdom of that time useful for the historian. His activity in regard to Hungary was specially important during the reign of Stephen, as his wife was Gisela, the emperor Henry II's sister.Az államalapítás korának írott forrásai, Szegedi Középkorász Műhely, Szeged, (1999) Notes References * *Roland Rappmann, Alfons Zettler. 1998.

It is in the center of Thiruvananthapuram city, the capital of Kerala.  History  The Library was established in 1829 during the reign of King Swathi Thirunal of Travancore. The work of starting and organising the Library was entrusted to Col. Edward Cadogan, then the British Resident who was the grand son of Sir Hans Sloane, the founder of the British Museum. Col. Cadogan was the first president of the Trivandrum Public Library committee, which managed the affairs of the Library. At that time, only a privileged class who were called to attend the Durbar of His Highness the Maharaja was allowed admission to the Library. The Library was then known as \\"Trivandrum People’s Library\\". Other landmarks in the history of library are: * 1898 AD - The assets of Trivandrum People's Library were transferred to the administrative control of Government and was opened to the public. * 1900 AD - His Highness Sree Moolam Thirunal constructed the present building for housing the library, which is an architectural beauty in the Gothic style, in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. * 1938 AD - The administration of the Trivandrum Public Library was handed over to University of Travancore (now University of Kerala). * 1948 - The State Government was directed to take over the administration of the Library from the University by a resolution of the State Legislature. * 1958 - The Library was declared as the ‘State Central Library’ of Kerala. * 1988 - The library was given the status of a minor department under the administrative control of Higher Education Department of Government of Kerala. *2005 - A New Heritage Model building was constructed within the campus for Children's Library. *2007- Online reservation and RF ID facility is introduced  Sections #Technical Section #Circulation Section (Books & Periodicals) #English Section #Malayalam Section #Hindi / Sanskrit Section #Reference Section #Children's Section #Binding Section #Reprographic Section #Closed Reference Section #Member's Reading Room (For A & B Member's only) #General Reading Room (For C & D Member's & Non Member's) #Cash Section #Administrative Office #Internet Browsing Centre #Kerala Gazette Section #Multimedia Section #Digital Library #British Library Collection #A Library science certification course in place. = Digital library = Library has a digital collection in searchable format of 709 books, in English and Malayalam. =Children's library= The New Heritage Model building within the campus is devoted for Children's library.

Alignment The party was organized to cater to the conservative leanings of some Nigerians, it flourished in the core northern states and Eastern states of Abia and Enugu. However, many felt there was little difference between the party and its competitor, the Social Democratic Party, another government created party. Both parties were under the supervision of the military government and most of its presidential candidates favored a continuation of the Structural Adjustment Programme of the Babangida administration. History  The party was largely an amalgamation of three major organizations, the Liberal Convention, the Nigeria National Congress and the Federalists. In its first presidential primary, the race was dominated by a few prominent Hausa-Fulani leaders. Adamu Ciroma, a former minister and former governor of the central bank was its leading candidate; he collected about 270,000 votes. Umaru Shinkafi, came in second with about 250,000.

He also held the title of Prince of Taranto. His nickname was Otto the Tarantine. Biography Otto was the eldest son of Henry II, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (c. 1289 - 1351) and Jutta of Brandenburg. In 1353, he married Violante of Vilaragut, a daughter of Berengar de Vilaragut and widow of James III of Majorca. There were no children from this marriage. By 1372, Otto was a widower. On 25 September 1376, Otto married his second wife, the three times widowed Queen Joanna I of Naples. The groom was fifty-six years old and the bride about forty-eight. The marriage was childless. The so-called Western Schism started in 1378 with the election of two rival popes, Urban VI of Rome and Clement VII of Avignon. Joanna supported Clement VII and allied herself with his main supporter Charles V of France. With no hope of having further children of her own, Joanna chose to strengthen her alliance with France by adopting Louis of Anjou, younger brother of Charles V, as her heir. Urban VI proclaimed Joanna deposed in 1381. He named her second cousin Charles of Durazzo as his candidate for the supposedly vacant throne. Charles spent the following months gathering his army within the Kingdom of Hungary and then marched against the Kingdom of Naples. Otto led the Neapolitan army in battle but was defeated. Otto was exiled from Naples by the new king and never returned. Joanna was strangled in prison in the Castle of San Fele on 12 May 1382. Otto survived Joanna by at least sixteen years but never remarried. He died childless at Foggia and was succeeded by his first cousin, once removed Eric I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, previously Duke of Einbeck.

It is situated between Leppävaara railway station and Kera railway station, approximately northwest/west of Helsinki Central railway station. History Kilo station has had three station buildings. The first was merely a small wood-heated cabin. The second was a larger wooden building and also included the white house of the track guardian, which still stands between the Kilo and Kera stations. This larger building was torn down in the early 1980s and replaced by a smaller sheet-metal building that served as the station's third station building. This latter building, which had been used as a kiosk since VR stopped selling tickets in Kilo at the beginning of the 2000s, has now been moved to a field across Lansanpurontie from the train station. In the 1980s, there was a small factory south of the tracks, right next to the station, but it was torn down, and many low-rise apartment buildings have been built in its place. The level crossing to the west of the station was removed in the middle of the 1990s and replaced by a tunnel east of the station.

It was brought to notoriety by General Charles de Gaulle in an angry speech during the student protests in Paris during May 1968 in France, when he used the vernacular term as a scatological pun \\"La réforme oui, la chie-en-lit non\\" meaning Reform yes, but chaos - no whilst the pun was Reform - yes, shit in bed - no . The term is now common parlance in French political commentary, used both critically and ironically referring back to de Gaulle. Origins First written appearance of the word Chienlictz in Gargantua. The blurred etymological origin of chie-en-lit / chienlit was the medieval carnival/masquerade when peasants and artisans had one day per year to celebrate, to abandon all work and chores, to abandon contemporary mores and conventions, to shit in bed. Somebody would be chosen as king for a day, and even the lord of the manor sometimes joined in, enduring ritual humiliation, such as being led through the streets like a servant, or slave, or dog. The first known appearance of the term is in the 16th century novel The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel by François Rabelais. and it was used by Émile Zola in both Nana (1880), and L'Assommoir (1887). Charles de Gaulle 'Chienlit' was brought to notoriety by General Charles de Gaulle in an angry speech during the student protests in Paris during May 1968 in France, when he used the vernacular term as a scatological pun \\"La réforme oui, la chie-en-lit non\\" meaning shit in bed. He used it first in a private meeting discussing the demand for direct participation in business and government by students and workers. This was first reported by the Minister of Information Georges Gorse and softened by the French media to 'masquerade/chaos'. De Gaulle then repeated it in a TV broadcast for high impact. Subsequently the students re-used the expression on leaflets where the silhouette of de Gaulle was accompanied by the slogans \\"La chienlit, c'est lui ! - the chienlit, it is him!\\" and \\"La chienlit, c'est encore lui ! - it is still him!\\". The term is now common parlance in French political commentary, used both critically and ironically referring back to de Gaulle. Chien lit - Dog bed De Gaulle's use of obscure vernacular profanity in a major speech was initially mistranslated by The Guardian and the English press corps as chien lit - dog bed, alluding to a chaotic, dishevelled, malodorous, flea pit, as in the English expression \\"a dog's breakfast\\".

The submarine was sunk while en route from Chatham to join the 3rd Submarine Flotilla at Dunoon, under the command of Lieutenant Mervyn Wingfield. From Dunoon she was to carry out a single working-up patrol in the North Sea before heading to the Mediterranean. Young was on board the submarine when it sank She stopped overnight at Sheerness and joined a convoy headed North. The submarine suffered engine failure with one of the two diesel engines and as a result fell behind the convoy; the propellers were driven purely by electric motors on the surface and when submerged with no mechanical linkage to the diesel engines. The convoy passed a Southbound convoy around midnight while about off Blakeney, Norfolk, with the two convoys passing starboard to starboard; this was unusual since ships and convoys should pass port to port. No ships showed any lights because of the risk from German E-boats. However, an armed escort trawler, Peter Hendriks in the southbound convoy accidentally struck Umpire sinking her in 18 metres of water. Four crew members were on the bridge when the submarine sank - Wingfield, the navigator and two lookouts.http://todaysmemoir.net/Jul19.html However, only Wingfield survived in the cold water to be picked up by the trawler. Several other personnel also survived, escaping from the sunken wreck using the conning tower or the engine room escape hatch, the majority wearing DSEA. Chief ERA Killen received a British Empire Medal for leaving the submarine wearing DSEA to check for obstructions around the engine room hatch and then returning to the engine room to assist the other crew members in escaping. He remained in the engine room until everyone else there had escaped. 16 of the crew successfully escaped, 22 crew were lost. Lieutenant Edward Young, one of the survivors from Umpire, later went on to command HMS Storm. The wreck is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

These quarries are now recognised archaeological sites. Eighty percent of the ancient quarry sites are in the Nile valley; some of them have disappeared under the waters of Lake Nasser and some others were lost due to modern mining activity. Some of the sites are well identified and the chemical composition of their stones is also well known, allowing the geographical origin of most of the monuments to be traced using petrographic techniques, including neutron activation analysis. In June 2006, the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) of Egypt established a new department for conservation of ancient quarries and mines in Egypt. The new department was designed to work in close cooperation with the regional SCA offices, and special training programmes for Inspectors of Antiquities will be carried out to enable the regional authorities to tackle inventory, documentation, risk assessment and management of the ancient quarries and mines. This article details some of the most important ancient quarry sites in Egypt.  The quarries of Aswan  The quarries of Aswan are located along the Nile in the city of Aswan. There are a number of well-known sites: Shellal, consisting of northern and southern quarries within an area of about on the west bank, and the islands of Elephantine and Seheil. One of the known directors of the Aswan sites was Hori during the reign of Ramses III. In the present days, the quarry area is to become an open-air museum. Typical materials known from this site are: * Red, grey, and black granite Some of the monuments known to come from this site are: * Cleopatra's Needle * The unfinished obelisk still on site, at the northern quarry * The unfinished partly worked obelisk base, discovered in 2005 * The sarcophagus made from granite at the burial chambers of the Third Dynasty Pharaoh Djoser at Saqqara and the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh Sneferu at Dahshur * Many burial chambers, sarcophagi, columns, and other structures in the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure at Giza  Gebel el Ahmar Gebel el Ahmar is located near Cairo on the east bank of the Nile, near the suburb of Heliopolis. The name means Red Mountain. The site was in full production in the times of Amenhophis III, Akhenaton, Tutankhamon, and Ramses III. The quarry was directed by Huy, known as \\"Chief of the King's Works\\", and also by Hori. Typical materials known from this site are: * Celestine and quartzite or red sandstone Some of the monuments known to come from this site are: * The Colossi of Memnon  Silsileh  Gebel el-Silsila or Gebel Silsileh is north of Aswan along the banks of the Nile. It was a very well known quarrying area throughout all of ancient Egypt due to the quality of the building stone quarried there. The site is a rich archaeological area, with temples cut directly in the hills. Examples include the rock temple of Horemheb on the west bank. Many of the monuments here bear inscriptions of Hatshepsut, Amenhotep II, Ramesses II, Merenptah, and Ramesses III. The quarries and the stone temples here are visible from boats on the Nile. Some of the monuments known to come from this site are: * Temple of Horemheb  Edfu  These quarries are located north of Edfu. Some of the monuments known to come from this site are: * Stone blocks used by the engineers of Septimius Severus to reconstruct the north Colossus of Memnon.  Wadi Hammamat  Wadi Hammamat is a quarrying area located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. This site is noted because it is described in the first ancient topographic map known, the Turin Papyrus Map, describing a quarrying expedition prepared for Ramesses IV.

From August 3, 2005, the lighthouse is occupied by the Russian Army. Not paying attention to the ruling of the Government Court in Sevastopol on the subject of the return of 77 geographical objects to Ukraine (including the lighthouse on Sarych), Russian military officials referred to the fact that they only subordinate to the chief of the Russian Navy headquarters and no one else. The Ukrainian public activists state that Sarych is illegally occupied by the Russian Navy. As a military object the territory around the Sarych headland is closed to trespassers with barbed wire with the Russian flag flying above Sarych. The issue has since become a small part of the broader 2014 Crimean crisis.  Battle of Cape Sarych On 18 November 1914 the waters off Cape Sarych saw the encounter of a Russian and Turkish naval force. The latter consisted of the German battle-cruiser SMS Goeben and the light cruiser SMS Breslau. Both ships were formally purchased by the Ottoman Empire and renamed as Yavuz and Midilli, although they retained their German crews. The Russian force consisted of five pre-dreadnought battleships. During the fight only a few salvoes were exchanged. The forces inflicted minor damage upon each other, but the commanding German admiral Wilhelm Souchon broke off the action after Goeben took a hit in one of her 15 cm casemates. He had to be very careful in putting his ship at risk, as the Ottoman Empire didn't provide facilities for repairing a modern ship like the Goeben. So he had to keep her in a battleworthy state.Action off Cape Sarych, by Steve McLaughlin (retrieved December 15, 2014) References External links * Photographs of Sarych Headlands of Crimea Headlands of Ukraine Territorial disputes of Ukraine Territorial disputes of Russia Russia–Ukraine border ","title":"Sarych"},{"id":"9693558","text":"The Philippine Scout mutiny was a mutiny by the Philippine Scouts of the Philippine Division which occurred in July 1924. The Philippine Scouts were raised by the US Army during the Philippine American War (1899-1902). They served as auxiliaries to the United States units and assisted in various duties such as navigation and combat. In the early 1920s, these scouts began to function as American units. They made up the core of US military rule in the Philippines. However, they were not given the same benefits as their white counterparts. With growing discontent, a mutiny was staged on July 7, 1924, at Fort William McKinley, but was quickly quelled. Many of the scouts who staged the mutiny were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. The US Army made no changes in the Scouts' pay, recruitment policies or leadership promotions.

It is located about eight kilometres to the north/northwest of Helsinki Central railway station. The Pohjois-Haaga station is located in the district of Lassila, between the stations of Huopalahti and Kannelmäki. It is the first station after the split between the Vantaankoski track and the rantarata track towards Turku. Near the station, from underneath the track on the bridge, is a light traffic route, which can be used to follow the train tracks all the way to the city centre. On the other hand, the tracks cannot be followed to the north towards Kannelmäki, because after Pohjois-Haaga, the tracks continue on a narrow bridge. Sometimes, pedestrians use the bridge anyway to get to the other side of Kehä I. This has caused dangerous situations. The Helsinki City Transport takes responsibility of the station.  History  During the planning phases of the Helsinki Metro in the 1960s, it was planned to build a line to the east of what became the Martinlaakso line; a station was planned to be placed in the very center of the district of Pohjois-Haaga. However, as the decision to replace this metro line with a local traffic railway under the ownership of the Finnish State Railways was made, the station was instead built in a sparsely populated area between Lassila and Pohjois-Haaga. Construction of housing and offices around the station took off only after the line was opened for traffic. The Martinlaakso line was opened for regular service in June 1975. The Pohjois-Haaga station building was funded by and came to be owned by the city of Helsinki, and was completed in October 1975, four months after the line itself; until then, the ticket office operated in a temporary building. The station building is made of rebar and brick with a facade of tile, and the final ticket office was situated on the ground level, from where passengers ascend to the side platforms via a stairwell. As with numerous other stations only serving local traffic, ticket sales at Pohjois- Haaga were ceased in June 2004.  Services  Pohjois-Haaga is served by lines P and I on the HSL commuter rail network.

It serves a number of critical functions in immunity, tolerance, and autoimmunity with the other numerous components. Furthermore, it is a crucial factor in connecting the recognition pathways of the overall system instigated by antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complexes to the other effector proteins of the innate immune response. For example, the severity of a dysfunctional complement system can lead to fatal diseases and infections. Complex variations of it can also lead to schizophrenia. Yet, the C4 protein derives from a simple two-locus allelic model, the C4A-C4B genes, that allows for an abundant variation in the levels of their respective proteins within a population. Originally defined in the context of the Chido/Rodgers blood group system, the C4A-C4B genetic model is under investigation for its possible role in schizophrenia risk and development.  History  One of the earlier genetic studies on the C4 protein identified two different groups, found within a human serum, called the Chido/Rogers (Ch/Rg) blood groups. O’Neill et al. have demonstrated that two different C4 loci express the different Ch/Rg antigens on the membranes of erythrocytes. More specifically, the two proteins, Ch and Rg, function together as a medium for interaction between the Ab-Ag complex and other complement components. Moreover, the two loci are linked to the HLA, or the human analog of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the short arm of chromosome 6, whereas previously they were believed to have been expressed by two codominant alleles at a single locus. In gel electrophoresis studies, O’Neill et al. have identified two genetic variants: F, signifying the presence (F+) or absence (f0/ f0) of four fast moving bands, and S, signifying the presence (S+) or absence (s0/ s0) of four slow moving bands. The homogeneity or heterogeneity of the two loci, with the addition of these null (f0, s0) genes, allow for duplication/non-duplication of the C4 loci. Therefore, having separate loci for C4, C4F and C4S (later identified as C4A or C4B, respectively), possibly account for producing multiple allelic forms, leading to the great size and copy number variation. Two important contributors, Carroll and Porter, in their study of cloning the human C4 gene showed that all six of their clones contained the same C4 gene. The C4 protein consists of 3 subunits (α, β, and γ) having molecular weights (MWs) of ~95,000, 78,000, and 31,000, respectively and they are all joined by interchain disulfide bridges. In a study by Roos et al., the α-chains between the C4A and C4B were found to be slightly different (MW of ~96,000 and 94,000, respectively), proving that there is actually a structural difference between the two variants. Moreover, they implicated that a lack of C4 activity could be attributed to the structural differences between the α-chains. Nevertheless, Carroll and Porter demonstrated that there is a 1,500-bp region that acts as an intron in the genomic sequence, which they believed to be the known C4d region, a byproduct of C4 activity. Carroll et al. later published work that characterized the structure and organization of the C4 genes, which are situated in the HLA class III region and linked with C2 and factor B on the chromosome. Through experiments involving restriction mapping, nucleotide sequence analysis, and hybridization with C4A and C4B, they found that the genes are actually fairly similar though they have their differences. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected, which allowed them to be class differences between C4A and C4B. Furthermore, class and allelic differences would affect the performance of the C4 proteins with the immune complex. Finally, by overlapping cDNA cloned fragments, they were able to determine that the C4 loci, an estimated 16 kilobase (kb) long, are spaced by 10 kb and aligned 30 kb from the factor B locus. In the same year, studies relatedly identified a 98 kb region of the chromosome the four class III genes (that express C4A, C4B, C2, and factor B) are closely linked, which does not allow for cross-overs to occur. Using protein variants visualized by electrophoresis, the four structural genes were located between HLA-B and HLA-D. More specifically, they verified the proposed molecular map in which the gene order went from factor B, C4B, C4A, and C2 with C2 nearest to HLA-B. In another study, Law et al. then continued to delve deeper, this time comparing the properties of both the C4A and C4B, both of which are substantial players in the human immunity system. Through methods that include incubation, different pH levels, and treatment with methylamine, they had biochemically illustrated the different reactivities of the C4 genes. More specifically, the C4B has shown to react much more efficiently and effectively despite the 7 kb difference between C4A and C4B. In whole serum, C4B alleles performed at a rate several fold greater during hemolytic activity, in direct comparison with C4A alleles. Biochemically, they also found that C4A reacted more steadily with an antibody’s amino acid side chains and antigens that are amino groups, while C4B reacted better with carbohydrate hydroxyl groups. Thus, upon analysis of the varying reactivities, they proposed that the exceptional polymorphism of C4 genes may bring about some biological advantages (i.e. complement activation with a more extensive range of Ab-Ag complexes formed upon infections). Though at this point in time, the genomic and derived amino acid sequence of either C4A or C4B had yet to be determined.  Structure  The early studies vastly expanded the knowledge of the C4 complex, laying down the foundations that paved the way to discovering the gene and protein structures. C. Yu successfully determined the complete sequence of the human complement component C4A gene. In the findings, the whole genome was found to have of 41 exons, with a total of 1744 residues (despite avoiding the sequence of a large Intron 9). The C4 protein is synthesized into a single chain precursor, which then undergoes proteolytic cleavage into three chains (in order of how they are chained, β-α-γ). The β-chain consists of 656 residues, coded by exons 1-16. The most prominent aspect of the β-chain is the presence of a large intron, ranging from six to seven kilobases in size. It is present in the first locus (coding for C4A) for all C4 genes and in the second locus (coding for C4B) only in a few C4 genes. The α-chain consists of residues 661-1428, encoding exons 16-33. Within this chain, two cleavage sites marked by exons 23 and 30 produces the C4d fragment (where the thioester, Ch/Rg antigens, and isotypic residues are located); moreover, most of the polymorphic sites cluster in this region. The γ-chain consists of 291 residues, encoding exons 33-41. Unfortunately, no specific function has been attributed to the γ-chain. The study completed by Vaishnaw et al. sought to identify the key region and factors related to the efforts of gene expression of the C4 gene. Their research concluded with the fact that the Sp1 binding site (positioned at -59 to -49) plays an important role in accurately starting basal transcription of C4. Utilization of electromobility shift assays and DNase I footprint analyses demonstrated specific DNA-protein correlations of the C4 promoter at the nuclear factor 1, two E box (-98 to -93 and -78 to -73), and Sp1 binding domains. These findings were later added to in another extensive study, that found a third E box site. In addition, the same findings postulated that two physical entities within the gene sequence could have a role in the expression levels of human C4A and C4B, which include the both presence of the endogenous retrovirus that can have positive or negative regulatory influences affecting C4 transcription and the varying genetic environment (dependent on which genetic modular component is present) past position -1524. To provide more context, in the latter study, the previously noted bimodular structure (C4A-C4B) has been updated to a quadrimodular structure of one to four discrete segments, containing one or more RP-C4-CYP21-TNX (RCCX) modules. The size of either C4A or C4B gene can be 21 kb (long, L) or 14.6 kb (short, S). Also, the long C4 gene uniquely contains a retrovirus HERV-K(C4) in its intron 9 that imposes transcription of an extra 6.36 kb, hence the “longer” string of gene. Thus, C4 genes have a complex pattern of variation in gene size, copy number, and polymorphisms. Examples of these mono-, bi-, tri-, and quadri-modular structures include: L or S (monomodular with one long or short C4 gene), LL or LS or SS (bimodular with a combination of homozygous or heterozygous L or S genes), LLL or LLS or LSS (trimodular RCCX with three L or S C4 genes), LLLL (quadrimodular structure with four L or S C4 genes). Not all the structural groups have the same percentage of appearance, possibly even further differences within separate ethnic groups. For example, the Caucasian population studied showed 69% bimodular configuration (C4A-C4B, C4A-C4A, or C4B-C4B) and 31% trimodular configuration (equally split between LLL as C4A-C4A-C4B or LSS as C4A-C4B-C4B). Regarding C4 protein sequence polymorphism, a total of 24 polymorphic residues were found. Among them, the β-chain expressed of five, as the α-chain and γ-chain produced 18 and one, respectively. These polymorphisms can be further categorized into groups: 1) four isotypic residues at specific positions, 2) Ch/Rg antigenic determinants at specific positions, 3) C5 binding sites, 4) private allelic residues. Additionally, the same study identified the expression of human complement C4 transcripts in multiple tissues. The results of a Northern blot analysis, using a C4d probe and RD probe as positive control, showed that the liver contains the majority of transcripts throughout the body. Even so, moderate quantities were expressed in adrenal cortices/medulla, thyroid, and kidney.  Function and mechanism  Two pathways of the complement cascade. Components and enzymes of the classical and alternative pathways of the complement cascade, which provides a complementary means for human and other systems to defend against foreign pathogens (see text). Not shown are elements of the lectin pathway. Note, while the appended letters in this figure are lower cases, they are synonymous with the same designations appearing in upper case in the text. As noted, C4 (mixture of C4A and C4B) participates in all three of the complement pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin); the alternative pathway is \\"triggered spontaneously,\\" while the classical and lectin pathways are elicited in response to the recognition of particular microbes. All three pathways converge at a step in which complement protein C3 is cleaved into proteins C3a and C3b, which results in a lytic pathway and formation of a macromolecular assembly of multiple proteins, termed the membrane-attack complex (MAC), which serves as a pore in the membrane of the targeted pathogen, leading to invading cell disruption and eventual lysis. In the classical pathway, the complement component—hereafter abbreviated by the \\"C\\" preceding the protein number— termed C1s, a serine protease, is activated by upstream steps of the pathway, resulting in its cleavage of the native, parent ~200 kilodalton (kDa) C4 protein—composed of three chains. The C4 is cleaved by the protease into two parts, a peptide C4a (small at ~9 kDa, and anaphylotoxic), and the higher molecular weight protein C4b, at about 190 kDa. The cleavage of the C4 results in C4b bearing a thioester functional group [-S-C(O)-]: work in the 1980s on C3, and then on C4, indicated the presence, within the parent C3 and C4 structures, of a unique protein modification, a 15-atom (15-membered) thionolactone ring serving to connect the thiol side chain of the amino acid cysteine (Cys) in a -Cys-Gly-Glu-Glx- sequence with a side chain acyl group of what began as a glutamine side chain (Glx, here) that resided three amino acid residues downstream (where the remaining atoms of the 15 were backbone and side chain atoms); upon cleavage, this unique thionolactone ring structure becomes exposed at the surface of the new C4b protein. Because of proximity to the microbial surface, some portion of the released C4b proteins, with this reactive thionolactone, react with nucleophilic amino acid side chains and other groups on the foreign microbe's cell surface, resulting in covalent attachment of the slightly modified C4b protein to the cell surface, via the original Glx residue of C4. C4b has further functions. It interacts with protein C2; the same protease invoked earlier, C1s, then cleaves C2 into two parts, termed C2a and C2b, with C2b being released, and C2a remaining in association with C4b; the C4b-C2a complex of the two proteins then exhibits a further system-associated protease activity toward protein C3 (cleaving it), with subsequent release of both proteins, C4b and C2a, from their complex (whereupon C4b can bind another protein C2, and conduct these steps again). Because C4b is regenerated, and a cycle is created, the C4b-C2a complex with protease activity has been termed the C3 convertase. Protein 4b can be further cleaved into 4c and 4d.  Clinical significance  Model of common structural genes and their possible contribution to the development of schizophrenia (as thoroughly defined in the Sekar et al. article) Although other diseases (i.e. systemic lupus erythematosus) have been implicated, the C4 gene is also being investigated for the role it may play in schizophrenia risk and development. In the Wu et al. study, they utilized the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) as an assay to determine the copy number variance (CNV) or genetic diversity of C4. Accordingly, with these results, future prognoses, flares, and remissions will become more feasible to determine. The results basically show copy number variants as a mechanism to effect genetic diversity. As discussed before, the different phenotypes allowed for by the varying genetic variety of complement C4 include a wide range of plasma or serum C4 proteins among two isotypes—C4A and C4B—with multiple protein allotypes that can have unique physiological functions. CNVs are sources of inherent genetic diversity and are engaged in gene-environment interaction. CNVs (and associated polymorphisms) play a role in filling in the gap towards understanding the genetic basis of quantitative traits and the different susceptibilities to autoimmune and neurobiological diseases. Substantial data from all over the world has been collected and analyzed to determine that schizophrenia, indeed, has a strong genetic relationship with a region in the MHC locus on chromosome arm 6. Data and information collected internationally can shed light onto the mysteries of schizophrenia. Sekar et al. analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of 40 cohorts in 22 countries, in total adding up to nearly 29,000 cases. They found out two features: 1) A great number of SNPs reaching only 2Mb across the end, 2) peak of association centered at C4, predicting that C4A expression levels is most strongly correlated with schizophrenia. In addition, they have discovered a mechanism by which schizophrenia could arise from the genetic predisposition of the human complement C4. As shown in Figure 1, four common structural variations discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies have pointed to the high turnout of schizophrenia. Possibly, the higher levels of expression of C4 protein due to pattern of variants of the C4 gene, allows for the unwanted increase in synaptic pruning (an effect produced by the effector proteins of the complement system in which the C4 partakes).

In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, he was an Irish Parliamentary Party MP for South Cork from 1885 to 1892, and then a Parnellite MP for Dublin College Green from 1892 until his resignation in 1896. Dr Joseph Kenny around 1895 Son of J. Kenny, manager of a lead mine at Palmerstown, Co. Dublin, he was educated at the Catholic University of Ireland in Dublin and at the University of Edinburgh, where he obtained his doctorate in medicine (M.D.) in 1870. After returning to Dublin, he became a medical officer to the North Dublin Union and in this role treated smallpox victims in the \\"sheds\\" at Glasnevin in the north Dublin epidemic of 1872. He caught the disease himself in spite of having been vaccinated. An active Irish Nationalist, in 1881 he was arrested under the Coercion Act and confined in Kilmainham Jail. Here his status as a qualified physician was of considerable value to his fellow Nationalist prisoners, including Charles Stewart Parnell, because he was able to insist that the prison authorities provide proper medical care. As a result of this prison term he was dismissed from his post as a medical officer to the North Dublin Union by Chief Secretary W. E. Forster. The Prime Minister Gladstone ordered his reinstatement to this post after his case was raised by Irish members in the House of Commons. Kenny was one of the Treasurers of the Land League and later of the Irish National League. He later became physician to the Catholic national seminary at Maynooth. At the 1885 general election, Kenny won South Cork by a huge majority over the Irish Conservative Party candidate. He was then returned unopposed in 1886. When the Irish Party split over Parnell's leadership in 1890, Kenny supported Parnell. As a result of the hostility of the Catholic Church to Parnell, Kenny was dismissed from his position as Medical Officer at Maynooth College on 23 October 1891, on straightforwardly political grounds. He was one of only nine Parnellites elected to Parliament in 1892, although he easily won Dublin College Green, securing just over 50 per cent of the vote in a three-cornered fight, and defeating the sitting anti-Parnellite T.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, where as member of the Irish Parliamentary Party and leading supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell he represented various Irish seats for much of the period from 1880 until his death in 1904. Life Leamy was educated at the University High School, Waterford and at the Jesuits' Tullabeg College, Co. Offaly. Called to the Irish Bar in 1885, Leamy was in 1880 elected as a Parnellite Home Ruler to one of the two seats for Waterford City. When representation at Waterford was reduced to one seat at the 1885 election, he stood down but was elected unopposed at Cork North East in 1885 and again in 1886. He also stood at Mid Armagh in 1885, but was not elected. Resigning from Cork North East in 1887, he was elected unopposed to a vacancy at South Sligo in 1888. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over Parnell's leadership, Leamy was one of the minority in the Irish National League who supported Parnell. Parnell made him editor of his newspaper United Ireland after regaining editorial control in 1891. At the subsequent general election in 1892, Leamy unsuccessfully contested East Waterford. He also unsuccessfully contested Galway City as a Parnellite in 1895 and as candidate for the reunited Irish Party in 1900.

Hestitantly legitimated by a decree of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria, it overthrew the government of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union headed by Aleksandar Stamboliyski and replaced it with one under Aleksandar Tsankov. Background The Bulgarian army, defeated in World War I, was limited in size of 20,000 men by the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine. A shadow of its former glory, the army retained weapons hidden away for better times. In 1919 a group of officers led by Generals Ivan Valkov and Velizar Lazarov – and joined by Kimon Georgiev and Damyan Velchev – formed the Military Union. This organization grew over the next couple of years to effectively command the army. After the war Aleksandar Stamboliyski was released from prison in an effort to quell the civil unrest against the wartime government and Tsar Ferdinand. The result had mixed success: Ferdinand abdicated in favor of his son, Boris III, and Stamboliyski became Prime Minister in 1919. His new agrarian government brought about reforms that, although may have been popular with the farmers who comprised over 80% of the population of Bulgaria (in 1920), were unpopular amongst the upper-middle class parties. Even more dangerous for Stamboliyski's government was that the armed forces was not allowed to nominate the Minister of Defence and had no representation in cabinet since the end of the war. This meant that Stamboliyski's government had no support from the army. As the power of the Military Union grew the civilian government was in danger of being overthrown by an unloyal army. To the dismay of opposition parties and Tsar Boris III, the BANU and Communist Party polled a combined total of 59% of the votes in the 1920 elections. The middle-class, business men and aristocrats worried for their interests that, for the first time, were being seriously challenged by the communists. As the agrarian government grew more and more autocratic. A group of political parties (the United People's Progressive Party, the Democratic Party, the Radical Democratic Party, and People's Alliance) ran together in the April 1923 elections as the Constitutional Bloc but only won 17 seats. Fraud and the newly effective first-past-the-post voting system were the culprits; although the BANU was still relatively popular amongst the countrymen. In 1922 after gaining the approval by a plebiscite, the government began trying and imprisoning leaders of opposition parties for their roles in previous wars. In the face of repression, several parties decided that the overthrow of the government was a necessity to their survival. Based in the Macedonian region of Bulgaria the nationalist and revolutionary Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization carried out attacks against Greece and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in attempt to free the Bulgarian lands under Greek and Yugoslav rule. On March 23, 1923 Stamboliyski signed the Treaty of Niš pledging to suppress their activities. The organization, until now at peace with the government, now began plotting against it. Preparations Opposition parties met with leaders of the Military Union to prepare for the coup. The Military Union, wanting to give an appearance of legality to the ouster of Stamboliyski, needed a civilian government to hand over power to. Coup On the morning of June 9, 1923, before dawn, the order was given for the garrisons in Sofia to block roads, cut telephone lines, and take control of key objectives such as police stations, post offices and train stations. After three hours, the coup was successful. By 5 a.m. a new government led by Aleksandar Tsankov installed in Sofia. The next morning the leaders of the coup meet with Tsar Boris at his palace in Vrana. After a six-hour meeting they convinced him to sign a decree legitimizing the new cabinet, on the condition the new government include agrarians and avoid repression. Both of these conditions were ignored. Aleksandar Stamboliyski was away from the capital on the day of the coup. He was arrested five days later and handed over to Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) fighters in his home town of Slavovitsa who brutally tortured him for hours, and cut off his hand, before finally murdering him. (Bulgarian) Aftermath Despite the initial success, the new government was still in danger. In several places, the coup met with the opposition of agrarian activists and communist activists, an event known in Bulgarian historiography as the June Uprising. The uprising was largely unorganized in its essence, lacking a common leadership – after the death of Stamboliyski – and a nationwide radius of action. Despite large-scale activity by the rebels around Pleven (which they managed to capture), Pazardzhik and Shumen, it was quickly crushed by the new government. Crucial was the inactivity of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Unlike the agrarians, the Communists Party of Bulgaria (BCP, member of Comintern) had a strong military organization. It was well supplied with arms by BCP followers within the barracks and, unlike the party of the agrarians, was already in the grip of the notorious communist iron discipline. Its position could allegedly have decided between the success or failure of the coup. In a move that would prove fatal to both the agrarians and later themselves, the communists did not take part in the June Uprising. Its leadership regarded both the uprising and the coup as \\"struggle for power between the urban and rural bourgeoisie\\" and as a replacement of one military dictatorship – that of the \\"rural bourgeoisie\\" and their 'posse comitatus', with another – that of the urban upper middle class. The party's stance of neutrality allowed the new government to crush the rebels and consolidate its power. Arrested rebels in Vratsa Under pressure from the Comintern, who condemned their inactivity, the Communist Party made preparations in August for an uprising the following month. This short time frame did not allow for nationwide organization. Furthermore, the new government was made aware of the impending rebellion and subjected the communists to mass arrests. This crippling pre-emptive blow crippled the rebels and who finalized plans for an uprising on the eve of September 23. The insurrection was put down by the army. Thousands of rebels were killed without charge or trial. This marked the debut of Aleksandar Tsankov's reign of \\"white terror\\", prompting the future bombing of the St Nedelya Church, prompting, in turn, martial law and an intensification of the terror.

He attended Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, where he played the saxophone and reeds (Multireedist) with the Auburn Knights Orchestra; Edwards would later try to complete his education at California State University, Los Angeles during the late-1980s while residing in Burbank. Out of school early from Auburn University (having played with The Auburn Knights Orchestra and singer Toni Tennille) he would play on the road with Richard Maltby and then with the Glenn Miller Orchestra before being drafted into the United States Army and stationed with the NORAD band in Colorado Springs, CO.

Edwards would first meet longtime musical associates Dave Wolpe, Warren Luening, Bob Payne, and Larry Ford while stationed at Colorado Springs. He toured extensively with the NORAD musical groups to include appearances at Carnegie Hall (May 1966), the Hollywood Bowl and Disneyland (September 1966), Expo '67 - Montreal World's Fair, the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (August and September 1967), the CBS The Mike Douglas Show, the Today Show, and NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.  The Lawrence Welk Show 1968-1979  After being discharged from the Army, he moved to Los Angeles and joined the Lawrence Welk Show orchestra in early 1968.

During this time Edwards proved to be one of the finest lead alto players for big bands and orchestras of a generation being able to fit any style, display incredible consistency, and having total command of playing lead piccolo/flute/clarinet/soprano sax/alto sax or even the oboe. The schedule for rehearsing and taping the show was rigid, constant, and sometimes hectic; the musicians were expected to play almost exclusively for the Welk television production rehearsals plus live taping (with studio audience) every week at the Hollywood Palladium from 1968 to 1976, 1976-77 at the Hollywood Palace, and CBS Television City from 1977 to 1979.*NOTE from editor/author: Dave commented in the early 1980s on how the pay and job consistency for the Welk Show Orchestra had been quite good but the taping schedule was relentless (it was live television). Over ten years was a long time and the show would be going away soon due to failing ratings and Lawrence Welk getting older as well as his audience. Dave said it was time to move on in 1979., The Lawrence Welk Show, Volare with Dave Edwards playing 2nd alto to Russ Klein's lead soprano, this is Dave's last season on the show.

Sexey's School is named after Hugh Sexey who, in 1599, was appointed as a Royal auditor to Elizabeth I and later as a Royal auditor to James I. Sexey's Hospital was established in 1619 from the proceeds of his will, and the school was founded in 1889. State boarding schools are most unusual in England and Wales. The school became an academy in August 2011. History Sexey's School dates back to a trade school which opened on 6 April 1891 with 15 boys. The first Head Master was William Albert Knight. The Head Master and the boys moved into temporary premises in a house known as 'The Glen' on Quaperlake Street in Bruton.Sexey's School. School History. Accessed 23 September 2016. At the end of its first year there were 40 boys at the school learning basic subjects including practical mechanics, land measuring and elementary science. The school was moved to its current site in 1892 in new buildings designed by Norwich-based architect George Skipper.George Skipper biography Retrieved 5 February 2014 The new buildings were formally opened on 19 April 1892. Sexey's was a grammar school until the Education Act 1944, after which it became a Voluntary Controlled school. In 1991 it adopted Grant Maintained status and in September 1999 it became a Voluntary Aided school. It remained an all-boys school until 1977 when it became fully co-educational. Boarding facilities were expanded in the 1980s with the building of two new boarding houses – Lisbury House and Coombe House – making Sexey's one of the largest schools of its type in the country. The school has continued expansion with the introduction of a policy in 2003 to take day pupils from a local catchment area of 1.5 miles. Prior to this the last day pupil was admitted in 1983. In 2001 the school had 394 pupils. In 2007 there were 512 pupils. As a state boarding (and day) school, Sexey's has complex funding arrangements with both state (government funded) and independent income (for the boarding facilities). In 2013 the then Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, described Sexey's as \\"one of the most outstanding schools in the country,\\" during an interview on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One.Gove Praises Sexey's, 24 November 2013 In 2019 two catering managers were convicted of defrauding the school of over £16,000. In 2019, after a number of poor Ofsted results and on the recommendation of the Regional Schools Commissioner, the school considered merging into the Sherborne Area Schools' Trust multi-academy trust. But following extensive parental engagement by Sexey's parents, governors and government representatives who were in opposition to the move, the Sherborne Trust decided not to proceed, stating there was \\"not an alignment of values or partnership working with Sexey's\\". The Regional Schools Commissioner is considering what the next step should be. Boarding Around one fifth of the school are boarders. There are two boarding houses: * Macmillan House, Opened 2011, is a new £3.5 m installation replacing Walwin House. Its name is a tribute to Douglas MacMillan who was an old boy of the school (Old Sexeian) and founded MacMillan Cancer Support. * Coombe House, opened 1983. Coombe has capacity for around 100 boarders in all year groups. Former boarding houses include: * Walwin House (formerly Junior House) was two houses built in the late 1930s. Walwin House used to accommodate year 7 boarders and had the capacity for 49 children – 30 boys and 19 girls. * Cliff House, a Grade II listed building built by Thomas Hannam in 1820 opened as a boarding house in 1892.

Cara also supports higher education institutions whose continuing work is at risk or compromised. Cara offers academics support to continue their studies either by financially and logistically assisting scholars relocate to higher education institutions abroad or by assisting academics in their country of origin. The organisation was founded in 1933 as the Academic Assistance Council (AAC), to assist academics who were forced to flee the Nazi regime. In 1936 it was consolidated and renamed the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning (SPSL). In 1999 it was renamed the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA). It changed to its current name in 2014. The charity is currently based on the premises of London Southbank University and continues to provide support to academics in danger. History William Beveridge The Academic Assistance Council (AAC) was founded in April 1933 by William Beveridge. Whilst en route to Vienna he learnt of the dismissal of a number of leading professors from German universities on racial and/or political grounds and was moved to launch a ‘rescue operation’ for the increasing numbers of displaced academics. On his return to Britain Beveridge set about enlisting the support of prominent academics. By May 22, 1933, a founding statementhttp://cara.ngo/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/Cara-Founding-Statement.pdf had been produced and it was circulated amongst British universities, politicians and philanthropists. This initial rallying call focused on the need for practical support, assistance escaping persecution and relocating in British universities, and deliberately avoided making any sort of political comment. The council was formed of 41 men and women active in British intellectual activities, and had as assistant secretary, the \\"redoubtable\\" Esther Simpson,BBC Radio 4, \\"Miss Simpson's Children\\", broadcast 12 May 2017: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08pgm4b. with office accommodation provided by The Royal Society. The Nobel Prize-winning chemist and physicist Lord Rutherford was chosen as the first President. A.V. Hill, another Nobel Prize- winning scientist, and also Cambridge University MP, became Vice-President.The council included J. S. Haldane and Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, Lord Rayleigh, Sir William Henry Bragg. In October 1933 ten thousand people attended an event at the Albert Hall organised by several organisations including the AAC. Albert Einstein, in his last major public address in Europe before his departure for the United States, spoke on the importance of Academic Freedom. In his address Einstein encouraged his audience to \\"resist the powers which threaten to suppress intellectual and individual freedom\\" and spoke of our duty to \\"care for what is eternal and highest amongst our possessions\\". In 1936 the AAC changed its name to the Society for Protection of Science and Learning (SPSL). This change reflected the ideological development of the role of the organisation: from assisting individual academics, to the protection of academic freedom itself. Thousands of academics were helped by SPSL in the 1930s and 1940s; some, having escaped Nazi Germany and Austria, then needed further aid to be released from British internment on the Isle of Man as enemy aliens. Sixteen academics assisted became Nobel Laureates, eighteen were knighted and over a hundred were elected as Fellows of the British Academy or the Royal Society. Notably Ludwig Guttmann went on to found the Paralympics; Max Born was a pioneer of quantum mechanics and one of the most prominent physicists to oppose the development of nuclear weapons; and Ernst Chain would be instrumental in the discovery of penicillin. The SPSL's work continued past the end of the Second World War. Beveridge would later explain in his A Defence of Free Learning (1959) how \\"although Hitler was dead, intolerance was not\\" and \\"continued needs and the possible future crises\\" rendered the Society's services as necessary as ever, in Europe and across the world. In the 1940s and 1950s, the SPSL helped many academics seeking refuge from the Stalinist regimes in the USSR and Eastern Europe. As time passed, the SPSL's focus expanded, to include, among others, those fleeing the apartheid regime in South Africa and juntas in Chile and Argentina. One of the most prominent South African exiles, whom the SPSL helped in 1966 and again in 1988, was the anti-apartheid leader Albie Sachs, later a Justice in the South African Constitutional Court under Nelson Mandela. Sachs describes the \\"immense moral and emotional comfort\\" which SPSL's assistance provided and he continues to be a supporter of the charity. Since the 1990s SPSL's focus has shifted to the Middle East, particularly Iraq and Iran, and to troubled regions of Africa. In 1999 SPSL was renamed Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara). In 2014 Cara was renamed again, but retained its acronym, becoming the Council for At-Risk Academics. This change reflected the fact that Cara helps many who are at great risk but do not see themselves as ‘refugees’, and instead still hope to return to their home countries when conditions allow.  Prominent academics assisted by AAC/SPSL/Cara  Amongst the 1,500 academics assisted in the early years, sixteen went on to win Nobel Prizes, eighteen received Knighthoods, well over a hundred were elected as Fellows of the Royal Society and of the British Academy, and many more became leaders in their respective fields. *Sir Walter Bodmer, a prominent human geneticist who is also credited with expanding public understanding of the sciences. *Sir Hermann Bondi, a mathematician who helped develop radar and influenced relativity theory, served as Chief Scientist to two UK government departments and as Master of Churchill College, Cambridge. *Max Born became the Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh and won the Nobel Prize in 1954 for his pioneering work in quantum mechanics. *Sir Ernst Chain won the Nobel Prize in 1945 for his shared work on penicillin. *Sir Geoffrey Elton, a historian and philosopher of history, helped to advance understanding of the Tudor government. *Sir Ernst Gombrich brought fundamental questions of aesthetics in art to scholarly and public attention. *Sir Ludwig Guttmann and his family were helped to emigrate from Nazi Germany in 1939. SPSL negotiated with the Home Office on their behalf, donated a sum of £250 (equivalent to around £10,000 in today's money) and helped them to establish themselves in Oxford. Here they stayed in the family of home of Sansie Lindsay, SPSL Councillor and Master of Balliol College.Interview with Eva Loeffler, daughter of Ludwig Guttmann: http://www.mandevillelegacy.org.uk/documents/Eva_Loeffler_full_interview.pdf Guttmann went on to found the National Spinal Injuries Clinic in Stoke Mandeville Hospital where he revolutionised the treatment of those with spinal injury and went on to establish what would go on to become the Paralympics. *Sir Peter Hirsch modernised the study of materials science and engineering at Oxford University. *Sir Otto Kahn-Freund was a leading theorist and practitioner of labour law. *Sir Bernard Katz won the Nobel Prize in 1950 for shared research on mechanisms of neuro-muscular transmission. *Sir Hans Kornberg works on the nature and regulation of carbohydrate transport in micro-organisms and advises Parliament on science and technology. *Sir Hans Krebs won the Nobel Prize in 1953 for his shared research into the complex sequence of metabolic chemical reactions known as the Krebs Cycle. *Sir Claus Moser, a prominent statistician, directed the Central Statistics Office and served as Pro-Vice Chancellor of Oxford University. *Sir Rudolf Peierls taught theoretical physics at Birmingham and Oxford and was involved in both the development of atomic weaponry and the Pugwash anti-nuclear movement. *Max Perutz won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962 for shared research into the structure of haemoglobin which added to our understanding of diseases of the blood. *Sir Nikolaus Pevsner brought new perspectives on the UK's architectural heritage to scholars and the wider public. *Sir Karl Popper, a hugely influential political and social philosopher, was a critic of totalitarianism in all its forms. *Sir Francis Simon pioneered research in thermodynamics and low-temperature physics at Oxford's Clarendon Laboratory. *Albie Sachs was helped by SPSL in 1966, and again in 1988. *Jack Mapanje Governance and Organisation Cara has a Council of Management of twenty- five, recruited predominantly from the world of academia. The Council of Management meets twice annually whilst the Council's Finance & General Purposes Committee meets at least quarterly. Professor Sir Malcolm Grant CBE is the President of Cara. Anne Lonsdale is Chair of the Council and Professor Sir Deian Hopkin is Vice-Chair. The Executive Director, Stephen Wordsworth, is charged with the day-to-day management of Cara and its staff. Current work  Cara runs several programmes. The Fellowship Programme supports academics, often in immediate danger, to continue their work in safety. Cara works closely with the 112 universities in the Cara Scholars at Risk UK Universities Network, as well as other institutions in the UK and abroad, to secure placements for academics. Cara checks the applicants’ background, qualifications and references and negotiates the details of the higher education placement. Fee waivers and financial and in-kind support are secured by Cara, whilst any additional funding needed is allocated from the organisation's own resources. Cara assists in obtaining the appropriate visas for both the academic and, often, their families as well. Many of the academics supported by Cara are committed to returning to their home country to rebuild their societies when conditions allow, employing the skills and connections they have obtained during their international academic placement. Cara also supports academics unable to return home because of continuing dangers by offering employment advice alongside training and education opportunities that enable academics to rebuild their careers in the UK. Cara's Country Programmes provide support to academics who are either working on in their country despite the risks or who have been forced into exile in the surrounding region. The Iraq Programme was launched in late 2006 in response to a targeted campaign of assassination and kidnap. Over 350 Iraqi academics were murdered between 2003 and 2012, with thousands driven into exile or internally displaced. At the height of the Iraq Programme, over 75 academics from 16 UK universities and 11 Iraqi universities collaborated on research of direct relevance to Iraq. Research focused on issues as diverse as: the impact of depleted uranium-contaminated soils; bias in primary/secondary school curricula and texts; the development of child mental capacities in the absence of existing services; use of mobile phone technologies to enhance public health services; and the status of female academics post-2003. Cara's Iraq Programme sought to ensure skills and expertise in Iraq and the wider region were developed rather than lost. The Zimbabwe Programme was launched in 2009 in response to a marked increase in the number of academics fleeing Zimbabwe, amid reports of a dramatic decline in the quality of higher education. The Programme offered grants and fellowships to pay for vital equipment and supplies, and in 2012 established a ‘Virtual Lecture Hall’ at the University of Zimbabwe. This enabled Zimbabwean academics in exile and others to connect in real time with the colleges and faculties of health and veterinary sciences, to plug knowledge gaps, to improve standards of teaching and research and to facilitate increased networking and collaboration. In response to demand, a second, mobile, system was provided in October 2013. The equipment has been formally handed over to the University of Zimbabwe, and continues to be in regular use, providing a long-lasting legacy  References   Further reading  * Zimmerman,David The Society for the Protection of Science and Learning and the Politicization of British Science in the 1930s (Minerva, 2006) * Seabrook, Jeremy The Refuge and The Fortress: Britain and the flight from tyranny * Marks, Shula (ed) In Defence of Learning * Pyke, David (2000) – ‘Hitler’s Gift’ ()  External links  * Cara (the Council for At-Risk Academics) Official Site Jewish emigration from Nazi Germany Organisations based in the London Borough of Southwark Refugee aid organisations in the United Kingdom * Academic freedom ","title":"Council for At-Risk Academics"},{"id":"9693871","text":"Cadetes de San Martín is a 1937 Argentine film directed by Mario Soffici and written by José A.

As a teenager, he attended Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts, before going to Stanford University to study physics and mathematics, where he obtained his BS in physics in 1959. In the years 1959–60 he studied physics and sociology for almost two years at the University of Warsaw, Poland as an exchange student from Stanford. He returned to Stanford, where he obtained his MA in sociology in 1962 and his PhD in Sociology in 1969.CURRICULUM VITAE: TOM R. BURNS at webb.uu.se.

Vol 3-4. p. 41 He started his academic career as Assistant Professor at the George Washington University, and moved to the University of New Hampshire in 1968, where he became Associate Professor in 1973. From 1976 to 1983 he was senior researcher at the Scandinavian Institutes for Administrative Research. In this period he also was Professor at the Stockholm University in Sweden from 1978 to 1980, Professor at the University of Oslo in Norway from 1979 to 1982. In 1982 he was appointed the position of Professor of Sociology at the University of Uppsala, which he held until 2002 after which he became Emeritus Professor. Back in the United States he was also Clarence J. Robinson University Professor at the George Mason University from 1987 to 1990. From 2003 to 2006 he was NORFA Professor at the Centre for International Environment and Development Studies Nof theorwegian University of Life Sciences. He was Visiting professor at the Lisbon University Institute (ISCTE), in Portugal from 2007 to 2013. Among his other professional engagements, he has been Jean Monnet Visiting Professor at the European University Institute, Florence, Italy, 2002; Visiting Scholar, Stanford University, Spring, 2002, Spring, 2004–2008; Fellow at Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences (Spring, 1992; Autumn, 1998), and Fellow at the European University Institute (Spring, 1998).  Work  = Actor-system dynamics (ASD) = Beginning in the early 1970s, Burns collaborated with a number of researchers, such as Thomas Baumgartner, Walter F. Buckley, Matthew Cooper, Philippe DeVille, David Meeker, Bernard Gauci, among others.Ruth Wodak, Paul Paul Anthony Chilton (2005) A New Agenda in (critical) Discourse Analysis: Theory, Methodology and Interdisciplinarity.. p.307 They have been developing a new theory complex, which came to be referred to as actor-system dynamics (ASD), a new social systems theory, substantially different from Parson's systems theory and the systems theory later developed by Niklas Luhmann.Tom R. Burns, Thomas Martin Baumgartner, Philippe DeVille (1985) Man, Decisions, Society: : The Theory of Actor-system Dynamics for Social Scientists. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers. This approach brought human agents in a natural and coherent way into system modelling. It saw agents (individuals and collectives) in their strategems and ploys as constrained as well as enabled by system structures, but also as forces structuring and restructuring systems and, in some instances, creating entirely new ones. This theoretical work always went hand in hand with a wide range of empirical investigations. It built bridges not only within the social sciences and humanities but also between the social sciences and humanities, on the one hand, and the natural, technical, and medical sciences, on the other hand. Research projects on the environment, technology, engineering, and medicine were an expression of this interdisciplinarity. = The ASD network = The ASD network led by Burns developed a complex of interrelated theories. Besides the ASD theory core, Burns and several of his collaborators developed a socially embedded, role based game theory, generalized game theory, which recognizes the social and psychological complexity of human motivation and action, the dilemmas and contradictions often facing social agents, and the problems matters of game equilibria and disequilibria. = Social rule system theory = On the basis of ASD theory Burns and Dietz developed a non-biological theory of sociocultural evolution, which they called Social rule system theory. Social rule system theory was formulated in the 1980s by Burns and Helena Flam together with others was a contribution to the New Institutionalism. = Sociology of human consciousness = In the 1990s a sociology of human consciousness was developed by Burns, Erik Engdahl, Nora Machado, and Sviatoslav Korepov based on sociology and social psychology traditions, in particular inspired by George Herbert Mead. In addition, a number of new theoretical concepts such as social structuring, meta-power and relational control, organizational dissonance and contradiction, and public policy paradigm theory were formulated and applied in empirical investigations. On a policy oriented level, the risks of complex socio-technical systems, the emergence of post-parliamentary democracy and new forms of governance, and the instabilities and ecological and social destructiveness of capitalism have been particular foci of attention since the early 1990s. = Uppsala Theory Circle = Burns was the founder of the Uppsala Theory Circle (UTC) at Uppsala University,Bernd Kasemir (2003) Public Participation in Sustainability Science: A Handbook. p. vii devoted to the development of sociological and social science theory and its applications in empirical and policy research. UTC functioned as an international, interdisciplinary collegium of scholars. A major pole of UTC was located in Uppsala, Sweden, but with contributors and participants found in other parts of Europe as well as in China, Africa, and the Americas. The group conducted regular seminars, workshops, etc. often engaging leading Swedish and international scholars who were fellows at The Swedish Collegium for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences. Beginning in the mid-1980s, this institution brought many distinguished scholars to Uppsala, in particular. The UTC was particularly active in the 1980s and 1990s. Since 2000, much of the core, which was engaged initially in Uppsala, has dispersed within and outside of Sweden.

He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1917 at the age of 16 and served with a detachment from Fort Riley, driving ambulances and motorcycles near the front lines in Europe. During World War II, just one month before his 41st birthday, he was captured by Japanese forces while working in the shipping business, and spent three years in the Philippines as a civilian prisoner. After the war, Buckles married in San Francisco and moved to Gap View Farm near Charles Town, West Virginia. A widower at age 98, he worked on his farm until the age of 105. In his last years, he was Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation. As chairman, he advocated the establishment of a World War I memorial similar to other war memorials in Washington, D.C.. Toward this end, Buckles campaigned for the District of Columbia War Memorial to be renamed the National World War I Memorial. He testified before Congress in support of this cause, and met with President George W. Bush at the White House. Buckles was awarded the World War I Victory Medal at the conclusion of that conflict, and the Army of Occupation of Germany Medal retroactively following the medal's creation in 1941, as well as the French Legion of Honor in 1999. His funeral was on March 15, 2011, at Arlington National Cemetery, with President Barack Obama paying his respects prior to the ceremony with full military honors. Early life and education Buckles was born to James Clark Buckles, a farmer, and Theresa J. Buckles (née Keown) in Bethany, Missouri, on February 1, 1901. He had two older brothers, Ashman and Roy, and two older sisters, Grace and Gladys. Several family members lived long lives; he remembered speaking with his grandfather who was born in 1817, and his father lived to be 94.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19271148 His ancestry included soldiers of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. In 1903, Frank—then known as Wood—and his brother Ashman contracted scarlet fever. Frank survived, but Ashman died from the disease at the age of four. Between 1911 and 1916, Buckles attended school in Walker, Missouri. Later, he and his family moved to Oakwood, Oklahoma, where he continued his schooling and worked at a bank. He was an amateur wireless operator, and an avid reader of newspapers. World War I and interwar years Five months after the American entry into World War I, Buckles sought to enlist in the armed forces. He was turned down by the Marine Corps for being too small, and by the Navy, which claimed that he had flat feet. He fared better with the Army, which accepted that he was an adult even though he looked no older than his 16 years. A sergeant advised that a middle initial would be helpful, so he adopted his uncle's name, \\"Frank Woodruff Buckles\\". Another sergeant suggested that the quickest way to the front lines would be to seek a position driving ambulances. Frank Buckles upon his national service recruitment age 16 in 1917 Buckles enlisted on August 14, 1917, and went through basic training at Fort Riley in Kansas. Later that year, he embarked for Europe aboard the RMS Carpathia, which was being used as a troop ship. During the war, Buckles drove ambulances and motorcycles for the Army's 1st Fort Riley Casual Detachment, first in England and then France. He later recalled his service as a doughboy: > There was never a shortage of blown-up bodies that needed to be rushed to > the nearest medical care. The British and French troops were in bad shape – > even guys about my age looked old and tired. After three years of living and > dying inside a dirt trench, you know the Brits and French were happy to see > us \\"doughboys.\\" Every last one of us Yanks believed we'd wrap this thing up > in a month or two and head back home before harvest. In other words, we were > the typical, cocky Americans no one wants around, until they need help > winning a war. A belt buckle similar to the one given to Buckles by a German prisoner in 1918 Buckles saw the war's impact on malnourished children in France, and more than 80 years later he could remember helping to feed them. After the Armistice in 1918, Buckles escorted prisoners of war back to Germany. One German prisoner gave him a belt buckle inscribed \\"Gott mit uns\\" (), which he kept for the rest of his life. Buckles was promoted to corporal on September 22, 1919. Following an honorable discharge in November 1919, he returned to the United States aboard . Early in the interwar period, he attended the dedication of the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of the Americans who died in World War I, and met General of the Armies John Pershing, who commanded the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during the war. Buckles then attended business school in Oklahoma City, and found work at a shipping company in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. From 1922 to 1923, he served with the Seventh Regiment of the New York National Guard in New York City where he also worked in financial services. Next came a career as chief purser on cargo and passenger ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed fears about the Nazis, and military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism and its effects firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their country would be brought down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl (Buckles provided these details many decades later). During and after World War II alt=A two-story white house with a porch and a balcony over it, flanked by two trees. A car from 1930s is parked at the house. As of 1940, Buckles had been employed by the White Star, American President, and W.R. Grace shipping companies, and in that year shipping business took him to Manila in the Philippines. After the outbreak of the Pacific War and the invasion of the Philippines, he reportedly remained in Manila to help resupply U.S. troops. He was captured in January 1942 by Japanese forces, and spent the next three years and two months as a civilian internee in the Santo Tomas and Los Baños prison camps. As a prisoner, he battled starvation, receiving only a small meal of mush served in a tin cup—a utensil he kept for the rest of his life. With a weight below , Buckles developed beriberi, and led fellow captives in calisthenics to counter the effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there. All of the captives were freed following a raid by Allied forces on February 23, 1945. Before the war he had become fluent in German, Spanish, Portuguese, and French, and by its end had learned some Japanese. After World War II, Buckles moved to San Francisco and married Audrey Mayo in 1946. Eight years later, the couple bought the Gap View Farm in West Virginia where they raised cattle. Ancestors named Buckles had settled near Gap View Farm centuries earlier. In 1955, their only child, Susannah, was born. By then, the world traveller had settled down to a life of farm activities, social events, and serving as an officer (eventually president) of the county historical society. Audrey Buckles died in 1999, and their daughter moved back to the farm to care for him. Active centenarian Buckles at age 107 with President George W. Bush in the alt=Frank Buckles in a wheel chair is talking to George W. Bush. In the background, above their heads are a plant decoration and a portrait of George Washington. After the start of the 21st century, Buckles continued living near Charles Town, West Virginia, and was still driving a tractor on his farm at age 103. He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war \\"unless it's an emergency\\". He has also stated that, \\"If your country needs you, you should be right there, that is the way I felt when I was young, and that's the way I feel today.\\" When asked the secret of long life, Buckles replied that being hopeful and not hurrying were key traits, adding: \\"When you start to die ... don't\\". In another interview, the centenarian talked about genetics, exercise, and a healthy diet, but put \\"the will to survive\\" above everything else. Buckles joined actor Gary Sinise in 2007 to lead a Memorial Day parade, and that evening his life was featured on NBC Nightly News. With the death of 108-year-old Harry Richard Landis in February 2008, Buckles became the last surviving American veteran of World War I. The following month, he met with United States President George W. Bush at the White House. The same day, he attended the opening of a Pentagon exhibit featuring photos of nine centenarian World War I veterans, with Defense Secretary Robert Gates in attendance. That summer, he visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Buckles was the Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation, which seeks refurbishment of the District of Columbia War Memorial and its establishment as the National World War I Memorial on the National Mall. He was named ABC's World News Tonight's \\"Person of the Week\\" on March 22, 2009, in recognition of his efforts to set up the memorial. Those efforts continued, as Buckles appeared before Congress on December 3, 2009, advocating on behalf of such legislation. He did so as the oldest person who ever testified before Congress. On Armistice Day (i.e. Veterans Day) of 2010, he made a further appeal: > We still do not have a national memorial in Washington, D.C. to honor the > Americans who sacrificed with their lives during World War I. On this eve of > Veterans Day, I call upon the American people and the world to help me in > asking our elected officials to pass the law for a memorial to World War I > in our nation's capital. These are difficult times, and we are not asking > for anything elaborate. What is fitting and right is a memorial that can > take its place among those commemorating the other great conflicts of the > past century. On this 92nd anniversary of the armistice, it is time to move > forward with honor, gratitude, and resolve. Passage of the legislation remained in doubt, because opponents sought relocation of the proposed monument, or alternatively some benefit for the District of Columbia. As of July 2013, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey was concerned that such a memorial would lead to the National Mall becoming \\"cluttered\\".Togneri, Chris. \\"Filmmaker driven to honor final wish of World War I’s last veteran\\", Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (July 7, 2013). Ultimately, the World War I Memorial was approved for a nearby site, with construction set to begin in 2018.\\"A Century Later, Plans Underway For World War I Memorial In Washington\\", Agence France-Presse (April 2, 2017). A Freemason and longtime Shriner, Buckles was a member of the Osiris Shriners of Wheeling, West Virginia, and he became \\"the oldest Shriner in Shrinedom\\". Other interests of his included genealogy; he had been a member of the West Virginia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution since 1935, and was active for many years in the Sons of Confederate Veterans. He was a Life Member of the National Rifle Association. On February 1, 2010—Buckles' 109th birthday—his official biographer, David DeJonge, announced a forthcoming documentary about him, entitled \\"Pershing's Last Patriot\\", described as a cumulative work of interviews and vignettes. DeJonge estimated a 2011 release for the documentary, and actor Richard Thomas is expected to narrate the film. In late 2010, Buckles was still giving media interviews and became a supercentenarian upon his 110th birthday, on February 1, 2011. On February 27, 2011, Buckles died of natural causes at his home at the age of 110 years and 26 days. He was the second-oldest living man in the United States at the time of his death (114-year-old American man Walter Breuning, born in September 1896, died 46 days after Buckles).Table B, as of March 21, 2012 Commemoration and funeral Buckles did not meet the criteria for burial at Arlington National Cemetery as he had never been in combat, but friends and family secured special permission from the federal government in 2008. That was accomplished with the help of Ross Perot, who had met him at a history seminar in 2001, and who intervened in 2008 with the White House regarding a final resting place. Upon Buckles' death on February 27, 2011, President Barack Obama ordered that the American flag be flown at half-staff on all government buildings, including the White House and U.S. embassies, on the day in March when Buckles would be buried at Arlington. Leading up to the March 15 funeral, the governors of 16 states likewise called for lowering their states' flags to half-staff. The United States Senate passed a resolution on March 3, 2011, honoring \\"the last veteran to represent the extraordinary legacy of the World War I veterans\\". Concurrent resolutions were proposed in both the Senate and the House of Representatives for Buckles to lie in honor in the United States Capitol rotunda. However, that plan was blocked by Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. When asked for explanation, their spokesmen would not elaborate on reasons for the decision. Boehner and Reid instead advocated a ceremony in the Amphitheater of Arlington National Cemetery. Various people had supported a rotunda ceremony, including Buckles' daughter, a great-grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, and former Republican Party presidential nominee Bob Dole. Faculty and students at Buckles' high school in Missouri gathered to honor him on March 8, 2011. His home church in Charles Town held a memorial service, attended by the Episcopal bishop of West Virginia, members of Buckles' family and others. On March 12, 2011, a ceremony was held at the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, to honor Buckles and the \\"passing of the Great War generation\\". The keynote speaker was former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers. A ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater Chapel preceded the interment on March 15. During the ceremony prior to burial, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden paid their respects and met with the family. Buckles' flag-draped coffin was borne to the burial plot on a horse-drawn caisson, and the folded flag was handed to his daughter by United States Army Vice Chief of Staff General Peter W. Chiarelli. Buckles was buried with full military honors in Section 34, near General of the Armies John J. Pershing. Reporter Paul Duggan of The Washington Post summed up the occasion: > The hallowed ritual at grave No. 34-581 was not a farewell to one man alone. > A reverent crowd of the powerful and the ordinary—President Obama and Vice > President Biden, laborers and store clerks, heads bowed—came to salute > Buckles's deceased generation, the vanished millions of soldiers and sailors > he came to symbolize in the end. In Martinsburg, West Virginia, on March 26, 2011, a candlelight vigil was held in memory of Buckles. Attendees made donations for a planned statue of him in Charles Town. In addition to being the last U.S. veteran of World War I, Buckles was the oldest World War I veteran in the world at the time of his death, as well as the last field veteran of the war. Following his death and funeral, there were two surviving World War I veterans, British-born Florence Green and British Australian citizen Claude Choules, both of whom served in the British Armed Forces. Choules died on May 5, 2011; Green died on February 4, 2012. Honors and awards For his service during World War I, Buckles received, from the United States government, the World War I Victory Medal and four Overseas Service Bars. He also qualified for the Army of Occupation of Germany Medal due to his postwar service in Europe during the year 1919, and received that medal after it was created in 1941. Buckles did not qualify for the Prisoner of War Medal, because he was a civilian at the time of his imprisonment by the Japanese. As a resident of Jefferson County, West Virginia, he was involved for many years with the Jefferson County Historical Society (including as President from 1960 to 1964). In 1981, the honor of Emeritus Officer was conferred upon him by that organization. In 1999, French president Jacques Chirac awarded him France's Legion of Honour, for his service during World War I. In 2007, the United States Library of Congress included Buckles in its Veterans History Project (VHP). He conducted three oral history interviews, given when he was 100, 103, and 107 years old. Information about Buckles' experiences in both world wars is available from the VHP, including a 148-minute video interview. In 2008, a section of West Virginia Route 9, which passes by his Gap View Farm home, was named in his honor by West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin. The following month, Buckles received the Veterans of Foreign Wars' Gold Medal of Merit at the Liberty Memorial. Also in 2008, he sat for a portrait to be displayed at the National World War I Museum. Buckles received the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry's Knight Commander of the Court of Honour (KCCH) in September 2008.

Cohen and produced by Julie Corman. Despite the implications of the film's title, it is a spoof of classic horror movies and not a parody of the Friday the 13th series or slasher films of that type. It was followed by Saturday the 14th Strikes Back in 1988. Plot An all-American family inherits a deceased uncle's house. John (Richard Benjamin) and Mary Hyatt (Paula Prentiss), together with daughter Debbie (Kari Michaelsen) and son Billy (Kevin Brando), move in, but Waldemar (Jeffrey Tambor), a vampire, and Yolanda (Nancy Lee Andrews), his wife, want desperately to get into the rundown house because it contains a book of evil. Billy finds the mysterious book. He reads of a curse hanging over the date of Saturday the 14th. As he turns the page, a monster is unleashed and with each turn, another disappears from the page and is materialized within or outside the home. The house is soon swarming with monsters. Strange things start happening: eyes appear in John's coffee, sandwiches are mysteriously eaten, the television tunes into The Twilight Zone only, dirt is found in Mary's bed, dishes get done by themselves, neighbors disappear. As this is happening, neither John or Mary suspect anything, completely oblivious to the spooky occurrences around them. Waldemar gets into the house by turning into a bat. Mary keeps hearing noises at night, which she thinks are made by owls, but are actually the sounds of Waldemar in bat form. John hires an exterminator to get rid of the owls. The exterminator turns out to be Van Helsing (Severn Darden), who is also after the book of evil. John and Mary begin planning a housewarming party for Saturday the 14th. Guests arrive, but they cannot leave. When they try, a thunderstorm appears outside the door. As the night unfolds, the monsters begin to kill the guests one by one. Eventually a duel between Van Helsing and Waldemar and Yolanda erupts, where it is discovered that Van Helsing wants the book in order to rule the world and Waldemar and Yolanda were only trying to stop him from getting his hands on it. Good triumphs over evil, as Van Helsing and the monsters are defeated. The Hyatts end up in an upscale new home, while Waldemar and Yolanda keep the original house as their own.

It premiered in Los Angeles on November 20, 1981. =Critical response= Variety called the film \\"a pathetic farce which will seem frail even on TV, for which it should probably have been made in the first place...As usual with recent New World productions, the special effects and, in this case, the monster get-ups are actually pretty good, but they exist in a vacuum of inspiration as to what to do with them.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times dismissed it as \\"an unfunny horror-film parody.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one star out of four and labeled it \\"a feeble comedy with a husband-and-wife star acting team mugging in front of the camera. Comedies don't need stars. They just need jokes, and 'Saturday the 14th' doesn't have many.\\"Siskel, Gene (September 1, 1981). \\"Saturday the 14th\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 12. Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote that the film \\"merely resurrects a passel of haunted-house wheezes so antique that even the Bowery Boys would be driven to groans by them.\\" He thought that children might enjoy it, but \\"that's really not enough to base a movie on.\\" Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was \\"not a laugh riot, but a silly spoof of horror movies whose appeal probably will be limited to younger people who haven't been exposed to making fun of Dracula for as long as the rest of us.\\"Gross, Linda (November 25, 1981). \\"'Saturday' Spoofs Evil In Eerie, PA.\\" Los Angeles Times.

It is a hemotoxin which acts as a serine protease similarly to thrombin, and has been the subject of many medical studies as a replacement of thrombin. Different enzymes, isolated from different species of Bothrops, have been called batroxobin, but unless stated otherwise, this article covers the batroxobin produced by B. moojeni, as this is the most studied variety. History Bothrops atrox was described by Carl Linnaeus as early as 1758, but batroxobin, the active compound in its venom, was first described only in 1954 by H. Bruck and G. Salem. In the years following, this first description of batroxobin was shown to have several uses in surgery. Because of the increasing interest in the properties of batroxobin, several studies on its hemostatic effect and coagulation have been published. More recently, in 1979, a German study showed the uses of batroxobin (reptilase clot retraction test) as a replacement test for the more commonly used thrombin time. Because the enzyme is unaffected by heparin, it is mostly used when heparin is present in blood. Recent studies emphasize more on improving its uses in surgery, mostly spinal surgery, and the uses as serine protease. Available forms Batroxobin is a protein of the serine protease family. Batroxobin is closely related in physiological function and molecular size to thrombin. Five subspecies for the Brazilian lancehead snake (Bothrops atrox) are found. Batroxobin obtained from certain subspecies exhibits the hemostatic efficacy, whereas the protein obtained from other subspecies exhibits the cleavage of fibrinogen. Some of the forms have hemostatic efficacy as main effect, where the other forms have degradation of fibrinogen as main effect. Batroxobin that is naturally extracted from the snake venom is mainly obtained from the snake Bothrops moojeni. But the concentration is low and it is difficult to purify the protein. Often the product remains polluted, this makes it harder to use for clinical purposes. Theoretically, the molecular weight of batroxobin should be around 25.5 kDa. Often, isolated batroxobin is heavier, around 33 kDa. The higher molecular weight is caused by a glycosylation modification during the secretion. The differences in weight result from different possible purification procedures, which can remove different sugar(chains) from the enzyme. Because the batroxobin isolated from venom is highly irregular in quality, it is now more often synthesized in organisms using Bothrops moojeni cDNA.  Structure  The structure and working mechanism of batroxobin extracted from the Bothrops moojeni have been thoroughly studied. Various subspecies exist and the working mechanisms of each batroxobin differ. As such, the structure of Bothrops moojeni batroxobin is further elucidated. The structure of batroxobin has been studied by various research groups throughout the years. These studies have mostly been performed by biologically synthesizing batroxobin from Bothrops moojeni cDNA, and analyzing this product and using homology models based on other proteases, such as thrombin and trypsin, among others. One of the earlier studies from 1986 showed that the molecular weight is 25.503 kDa, 32.312 kDa with the carbohydrate, and it consists of 231 amino acids. The amino acid sequence exhibited significant homology with other known mammalian serine proteases, such as trypsin, thrombin, and most notably pancreatic kallikrein. It was therefore concluded that it is indeed a member of the serine protease family. Based on the homology, the disulfide bridges were identified and the structure was elucidated further. A later molecular modelling study from 1998 used the homology between glandular kallikrein from the mouse and batroxobin, which is about 40%, to propose a 3D structure for biologically active batroxobin. To date no definite 3D structure has been proposed. Biological synthesis in micro-organisms After the cDNA nucleotide sequence of batroxobin from Bothrops moojeni was determined back in 1986, a research group from the Kyoto Sangyo university successfully expressed the cDNA for batroxobin in E. Coli in 1990 The recognition sequence for thrombin was used to obtain mature batroxobin. The fusion protein which was obtained was insoluble and was easily purified. After cleaving the fusion protein, the recombinant batroxobin could be isolated by electrophoresis and it was then successfully refolded to produce biologically active batroxobin. This study showed that it was possible to produce batroxobin using micro- organisms, a method which was more promising than isolating the enzyme from extracted snake venom. In 2004, a research group from Korea produced batroxobin by expressing it in the yeast species Pichia pastoris. This recombinant enzyme had a molecular weight of 33 kDa and included the carbohydrate structure. This method of expressing it in Pichia pastoris turned out to be more effective, as the produced enzyme showed cleaving activity which was more specific than thrombin in some cases and was more specific than non-recombinant batroxobin. Therefore, synthesis using Pichia pastoris seems promising for producing high quality recombinant batroxobin. Toxicodynamics and reactivity =Reactions and mechanism of action= As described earlier, batroxobin is an enzyme which has a serine protease activity on its substrate, fibrinogen. A serine protease cleaves a protein at the position of a serine, to degenerate a protein. Batroxobin is comparable to the enzyme thrombin, which is also a serine protease for fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is an important protein for hemostasis, because it plays a critical role in platelet aggregation and fibrin clot formation. Normally when one is wounded, thrombin cleaves the fibrinogen, which forms clots. As a result, the wound is ‘closed’ by these clots and recovery of the epithelial cells of the skin can take place. This is the natural process necessary for tissue repair. The venom batroxobin also induces clots, but does this with or without tissue damage. This is because batroxobin isn’t inhibited by specific cofactors like thrombin is. These clots can block a vein and hinder blood flow. =The differences between thrombin and batroxobin in binding fibrinogen= Fibrinogen is a dimeric glycoprotein, which contains two pairs of Aα-, Bβ- peptide chains and y- chains. There are two isoforms of this fibrinogen, one with two yA-chains (yA/yA) and one with a yA-chain and a y’-chain (yA,y’) When fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin, it releases fibrinopeptide A or B. Thrombin acts on two exosites to fibrinogen. Exosite 1 mediates the binding of thrombin to the Aα- and Bβ-chains, and exosite 2 causes an interaction with a second fibrinogen molecule at the C-terminus of the y’-chain. Consequently, when thrombin binds a yA/yA fibinogen only exosite 1 is occupied, and when it binds yA/y’ both exosites are bound tightly. So fibrinogen yA/y’ is a competitor to yA/yA, which decrease the amount of clotting. yA/y’ binds with a factor 20-fold greater than yA/yA. There are also clotting inhibitors like antithrombin and heparin cofactor II, which prevent clotting when it isn’t necessary. In contrast, batroxobin isn’t inhibited by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II. Batroxobin also has a high Kd value for binding both forms yA/yA and yA/y’. The bindings sites of batroxobin and thrombin partially overlap, but there are some differences. The fibrin-bound batroxobin retains catalytic activity and is a more potent stimulus for fibrin aggregation than fibrin-bound thrombin. This is probably due to the more lipophilic character of exosite 1, that binds fibrinogen more tightly. Fibrinogen is the sole substrate for batroxobin, whereas thrombin has multiple substrates. This is probably due to the Natrium- binding pocket that thrombin contains. Toxicokinetics Toxicokinetic studies have been performed on various animal species, namely dogs, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats and monkeys. The research was performed by using immunoassays to obtain the plasma and urinary levels of batroxobin. They also measured the levels of fibrinogen. =Exposure= Normally the venom is directly injected into the bloodstream by the snake. In the experiments performed they also used intravenous injection of batroxobin. They used a total dose of 2 BU/kg (in dogs also 0.2 BU/kg) given during a time of 30 minutes, three times a day. In the graph below you can see the plasma concentrations of batroxobin after administration. =Distribution= All the species showed a large Vd (Volume of Distribution). The value of the plasma in animals was around 50ml/kg on average. In dogs and monkeys the value of the Vd was very low compared to other species, namely 1.5 times the value of plasma in other animals. So the batroxobin is distributed mainly through veins and little is taken up by tissues. In the other species this value was around four times higher. This might be because batroxobin is more easily taken up by the reticuloendotherial system in those species. =Excretion= Batroxobin is excreted by the liver, kidney and spleen. The excretion of batroxobin can be detected by small metabolite molecules in the urine. With use of the immunoassay only 0.2 - 1.9% of the dose was detected in the urine. The amount of radioactivity of 125I-batroxobin was 69% in rats and 73% in dogs within 48 hours. So batroxobin is mainly excreted through the kidneys in its degraded form. So it isn’t detectable with an immunoassay. =Metabolism= All the species responded differently to batroxobin exposure. This means that their ability to metabolize this protease is not the same. They all have their own half-lifes. The half-life in dogs are the highest 3.9 h and 5.8 h. In rabbit and mouse the half-life values were very low, 0.3 h and 0.4 h respectively. Because batroxobin is an enzyme, it is degraded by a protease, and cleaved in smaller unfunctional parts. Toxicity An overdose of batroxobin will eventually lead to death, due to hemostatic effects. No lethal- or safe dose has been determined in humans yet. The safe dose for rats is 3.0 KU/kg and for Macaca mulatta 1.5 KU/kg. The lethal dose has only been studied in mice and is 712.5548 ± 191.4479 KU/kg. Clinical use The medicine Defibrase© is the trade name given to batroxobin and is isolated from the venom of Bothrops moojeni. It functions as an defibrinogenating agent and is used for patients with thrombosis. The batroxobin from the snake Bothrops atrox is patented as Reptilase and used as a hemostatic drug.

Postconstructivism was a transitional architectural style that existed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, typical of early Stalinist architecture before World War II. The term postconstructivism was coined by Selim Khan-Magomedov, a historian of architecture, to describe the product of avant-garde artists' migration to Stalinist neoclassicism.Russian: С.О.Хан-Магометов. «Архитектура Советского авангарда».Т1. Москва. Стройиздат. 1996 (S.O. Khan-Magomedov, \\"Soviet avantgarde architecture\\", 1996)English 1987 version: Khan-Magomedov, \\"Pioneers of Soviet Architecture: The Search for New Solutions in the 1920s and 1930s\\", Thames and Hudson Ltd, Khan-Magomedov identified postconstructivism with 1932–1936, but the long construction time and vast size of the country extended the period to 1941. Existence of this style is evident, but Khan- Magomedov's explanation of its evolution as a natural process inside the architectural community, rather than as a result of political direction by the Party and State, is strongly disputed. Khan-Magomedov's viewpoint This section is based on Khan-Magomedov's Soviet avant-garde architecture, vol.1, \\"Avant-garde to postconstructivism and beyond\\" =Background= In 1932–1933, during the Palace of Soviets contest, the State sent a clear message to architects that the age of experiment was over and the new buildings must follow the classical canon. At this time, the architectural profession was divided into three generations: * Mature Neoclassical architects (most of them in their fifties and sixties), like Ivan Fomin, Alexey Shchusev and Ivan Zholtovsky. Excellent education Academic training in Tsarist Russia was long. Zholtovsky trained for his diploma for 11 years, Fomin - 17 years. and experience led them to success in any style – Art Nouveau, Neoclassicism and Constructivism. * A younger, diverse avant-garde movement (itself divided into rationalists and constructivists). With the exception of the Vesnin brothers, few constructivists had acquired professional experience before World War I; the war, Revolution of 1917 and Civil war halted any new construction for a decade (1914–1926). In 1927–1929, former theorists Nikolai Ladovsky, Moisei Ginzburg, Ilya Golosov stepped aside from public discussions and switched to practical building and urban planning. By 1933, they had not more than seven years of practice and were just entering their own age of maturity. * Finally, the vocal students of the 'Proletarian School', members of VOPRA: the \\"class of 1929\\" (Arkady Mordvinov, Karo Alabyan). Trained by Constructivist leaders in a style they dubbed \\"sterile avant-garde,\\" they were completely unaware of the classical legacy and had no practical experience. They compensated for this with left-wing political assaults and accusations, in particular a campaign against Ivan Leonidov. =Birth of a style= According to Khan- Magomedov, two forerunners of the style were Ivan Fomin and Ilya Golosov. They converged on the same form from opposite directions – neoclassicismNote that Ivan Fomin (like Alexey Shchusev) was successful in any style, including Constructivism – he practiced whatever was in demand. and constructivism. Fomin's concept, easily formulated, erected in steel and granite in Moscow (Dynamo Building), was well understood even by the inexperienced youth. \\"The youth instinctively followed those who managed to declare their stance clearly. The youth believed that this period is a self-sufficient cultural stage, not a transition to something else\\". In 1933–34, Golosov publicly disposed of the avant-garde. He returned to Neoclassicism, trying to avoid direct citations from the past. For example, he used square columns instead of traditional, round ones. Square, lean columns without capitals became a trademark feature of the emerging style. Golosov's entries in public design contests exposed his style to numerous followers. Ivan Fomin and Ilya Golosov. Original concepts (never materialized): Image:Yaweyn_kursky_fomin.jpgIvan Fomin. Kursky Rail Terminal, 1933 Image:Yaweyn_kursky_fomin_hall.jpgIvan Fomin. Kursky Rail Terminal, 1933 =Style defined= Khan-Magomedov defined postconstructivism as \\"neoclassical shapes without neoclassical detailing\\". Golosov and his followers deliberately replaced the proven historical details (columns, capitals, friezes, and cornices) with their inventions – to differentiate themselves from pure Revivalists. The main volumes follow the classical rules and usually are perfectly symmetrical. Ilya Golosov and Vladimir Vladimirov. Apartment buildings in Moscow Image:Moscow_golosov.jpgIlya Golosov.

Aviazhilstroy, Patriarshy Ponds, Balcony =Recognition= Postconstructivism benefited from a natural reaction against both the avant-garde and the eclectics of the past. It was perceived as new, and at the same time allowed grand buildings that were to the taste of provincial elite. Another benefit in a time of total rationing was that, unlike Constructivism, the new style minimized use of steel and cement, turning back to primitive masonry with wooden floors and partitions. This helps explain the spread of Postconstructivism in the 1930s.

These architects completely lacked the classical training of older Constructivists; lack of skill prevented them from inventing their own incarnation of classical legacy; all they could do was copying. As a result, they buried their avantgarde teachers and proceeded straight to pure neoclassicism. They could not stop at postconstructivism because they – unlike Golosov or Fomin – could not innovate. Meanwhile, Fomin died in 1936, and Golosov was aging physically, clearing the road for the young. Another group of young architects, seeking academic training, joined the workshops of Zholtovsky and other old neoclassicists. They, too, skipped over postconstructivism – straight to the Stalinist canon. Their old mentors were still active and enjoyed the support of the State. There was no need for inventing new shapes or styling anymore. Postconstructivist projects dragged on for a few more years, but World War II finally sealed the fate of this style. Criticism of Khan-Magomedov's viewpoint =Role of state= Authors like Dmitry KhmelnitskyRussian: Dmitry Khmelnitsky, \\"Stalin and Architecture\\", 2004, www.archi.ru appreciate Khan- Magomedov's studies of the 1920s and 1930s, but completely disagree with him on the origins and evolution of early Stalinist architecture Russian: Dmitry Khmelnitsky, \\"New versions of History\\", 2000, www.archi.ru and the demise of Constructivism. Khan-Magomedov barely mentions the role of State (or Joseph Stalin personally) in those events, presenting the demise of avant-garde as a natural evolution within the professional community. He admits that the profession was manipulated by the \\"class of 1929\\" youth, but does not study the forces that shaped and directed their assaults. Not a word on Stalin's personal influence, not a word on rising terror. Khan-Magovedov discusses the 1929–1931 political assaults by VOPRA at length, but fails to mention that they were part of an all-out national campaign. As Khmelnitsky summarized it, \\"Postconstructivism was born by terror. The very term is misleading. Traces of the Constructivist style in the Postconstructivism of the 1930s are a sign of indecision, not tradition. They banned constructivism, but didn't explain what to do; the result is an architectural pathology. Comparison with European parallels is useless. There were no European parallels, even Nazi architecture does not come close\\". =Art Deco factor= Postconstructivism merged closely with Soviet adaptations of Art Deco. Some examples of this style, like the 1934 Lenin Library by Vladimir Shchuko, may be mistaken for Postconstructivism. In fact, Schuko was a seasoned Neoclassicist and the Library was his attempt to differentiate into proletarian classic with Art Deco tools. The situation inside the professional community was even more diverse than Khan-Magomedov's picture. Vladimirov's apartment block featured above is usually classified as an Art Deco adaptation, too. Present day Preobrazhenskaya Zastava, 2002–2005, Moscow =Public awareness and preservation= The general public is seldom aware of the concept of postconstructivism. Real estate agents classify these buildings as early stalinka, and that's how they are perceived by the public. In Moscow, such buildings are gradually torn down or completely rebuilt (see facadism); demolition of postconstructivist buildings, with few exceptions, goes unnoticed even within the preservationist community. One recently lost example was A.A. Samoilov's building on Novy Arbat in Moscow, torn down in 2006.Russian: photo gallery, www.wbb.ru =Safety hazards= The buildings of the 1920s–1930s were built using primitive technologies (masonry, wet stucco, wooden ceilings and partitions), low-grade materials and a low-grade workforce. Poor initial quality and inadequate maintenance led to rapid decay. Excluding a few well-maintained, high-class apartment buildings, early stalinka are unsafe. February 10, 1999, a fire in Samara police department, built 1936, killed 57 men and women.Russian: Radio interview with federal fire marshal of Russia, 10/02/2000 echo.msk.ru On February 13, 2006, Panteleimon Golosov's Constructivist Pravda Building burnt down, killing one person and injuring four.Russian: Анна Куприна. \\"Виновники в пожаре 'Правды' не найдены\\". 12.07.2007, www.smi.ru English: \\"Fire on Ulitsa Pravda Comparable To Manezh Fire for the Russian Avant-Garde', Izvestia, 20.02.2006, Moscow Architecture Preservation Society =Reconstruction= Proper reconstruction of Constructivist or early stalinka buildings is challenging. The structures are weak, and often require complete demolition. A notable example is School 518 (Balchug, Moscow), designed in 1933 by Ivan Zvezdin (1899–1979) Russian: Zvezdin bio at School 518 site and completed in 1935. Praised by Khan- Magomedov, the only Postconstructivist building entered on the national monument register, the school was reconstructed in 2001 to modern safety standards. Most of load-bearing walls and all 1935 interiors were completely rebuilt from scratch.Photo gallery, interiors before and after reconstruction School 518 site =Revival= New postconstuctivist or early stalinka buildings are rare. Preobrazhenskaya Zastava (Преображенская Застава) mixed- use project (two blocks, 308 apartments and retail stores) was completed in 2002–2005. Unusually for present-day Moscow, it actually looks like a period piece, not a cheap modern replica. There are no trademark square columns or slim porticos, yet it is the best attempt to recreate a style of the 1930s. On a smaller scale, Russian architectural firms design country houses in true postconstructivist shape.Russian: photo gallery www.wbb.ru See also * School 518 * Russian Revival architecture Footnotes Architectural styles Architecture of Russia Soviet art ","title":"Postconstructivism"},{"id":"9694126","text":"Muchachos de la ciudad is a 1937 Argentine film directed and written by José A.

While a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, he won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1996 for his coverage of the Srebrenica massacre. From 2002 until 2005, he was co-chief of The New York Times South Asia bureau, based in New Delhi, India. He later contributed to the newspaper's team coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan that received the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting and was a finalist in his own right in the category in 2010.Finalist: David Rohde of The New York Times pulitzer.org He is also a global affairs analyst for CNN. While in Afghanistan, Rohde was kidnapped by members of the Taliban in November 2008, but managed to escape in June 2009 after seven months in captivity. While he was in captivity, The New York Times collaborated with a number of media outlets, including al-Jazeera and Wikipedia, to remove news of the kidnapping from the public eye. Background Rohde is a native of Maine. He is a graduate of Fryeburg Academy, a boarding school located in Fryeburg, Maine. He attended Bates College before transferring to Brown University, where he received a B.A. in history in 1990. He is married to Kristen Mulvihill, a picture editor for Cosmopolitan magazine. =Reporting= Rohde worked as a production secretary for the ABC News World News Tonight program from June 1990 to August 1991 and as a production associate for ABC's New Turning Point from January to July 1993. He has also worked as a freelance reporter based in the Baltic republics, Cuba, and Syria. He served as a county and municipal reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer from July 1993 to June 1994 before joining The Christian Science Monitor. He initially covered national news, reporting from Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C.. In November 1994, he was sent to Zagreb, Croatia, to work as the newspaper's Eastern European correspondent, in which role he helped to expose the ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Muslim population of eastern Bosnia. He joined The New York Times in April 1996 and worked for them through mid-2011. He reported from Afghanistan for the first three months of the US-led war against the Taliban and served as co-chief of the Timess South Asia bureau from 2002 to 2005. From 2005 to 2011, he was a member of the Timess investigations department in New York City. Before joining The New Yorker in May 2017, he worked for Reuters in a variety of capacities, including foreign affairs columnist (2011-2013), investigative reporter (2014-2015) and national security investigations editor (2015-2017).https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-rohde-00ab5614 He was described by his Times colleagues as \\"an intrepid yet unassuming reporter who conducts himself modestly around the office, predictably attired in neatly ironed Oxford shirts and, often, his weathered Boston Red Sox cap.\\" Srebrenica Rohde was the first outside eyewitness of the aftermath of the Srebrenica massacre when he traveled to the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica and Zepa in August 1995, a month after the fall of the towns to the Army of the Republika Srpska. He reported seeing human bones, \\"Muslim prayer beads, clothing and still legible receipts and election ballots from Srebrenica\\", as well as shell casings and ammunition boxes in the vicinity of three large mass graves. He described being told that Bosnian Serb troops were hunting down and summarily executing Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) from the town. He subsequently located eyewitnesses to the massacre and wrote about the circumstances that led up to the killings. He returned to the Republika Srpska in October 1995 to follow up his article on the Srebrenica massacre but was secretly arrested by Bosnian Serb authorities on October 29 in the town of Zvornik, around 80 miles from Sarajevo. He was charged with \\"illegal border crossing and staying on the territory of the Republika Srpska and for falsifying documents\\". He was held captive in the Bosnian Serb-held town of Bijeljina for ten days, during which he was repeatedly interrogated, harassed and kept in a 10-foot-by-20-foot (3m by 7m) cell with five other inmates for over 23 hours a day. Rohde was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment on the first two charges and was due to be sentenced on the spying charge before he was released. The trial had been held in Serbo-Croatian and, although a translator was present, there was no defense lawyer and no US diplomatic representation as required by the Vienna Convention. The espionage charge, the most serious of the three, was \\"punishable by three to 15 years (imprisonment) in peacetime and 10 years to death in wartime.\\" Rohde's capture was not initially admitted by the Bosnian Serb authorities, who gave conflicting answers as to whether he had been detained and where he was being held. Five days after he was taken prisoner, the Bosnian Serb news agency issued a statement on his capture. The US Government subsequently brought to bear intense diplomatic pressure to release him. A key role was played by Kati Marton, an author and journalist married to the US envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was negotiating with the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević to end the Bosnian War. Marton, who was at the time the chairwoman of the Committee to Protect Journalists, intervened repeatedly during the talks that led to the Dayton Agreement to persuade Milošević to use his influence to secure Rohde's release. The US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was also involved in pressing for Rohde's release at the Dayton talks. A variety of other political and journalistic figures were also involved in campaigning on Rohde's behalf, including Senator Bob Dole, Peter Jennings, Ted Koppel, Samantha Power, and David Frost. Rohde was subsequently pardoned by order of the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić in what Karadžić characterized as a goodwill gesture. Following his release, Rohde reported that he had reached Srebrenica and found substantial evidence of the massacre at four of six of the mass grave sites previously identified by US reconnaissance aircraft and satellites and commented: \\"A final, accurate accounting of the Srebrenica massacres will only come if Sahanici and the other five sites are dredged for the truth.\\" He described the circumstances of his arrest: \\"This correspondent changed the date of issue on a Bosnian Serb press accreditation from 19/12/94 to 29/10/95 and used it to pass through Bosnian Serb checkpoints and reach the area. This correspondent was arrested at the execution site by Bosnian Serb police, stripped of all documents and photos taken of the area, accused of espionage, and jailed for 10 days.\\" His ordeal in captivity and the subsequent negotiations to free him were described in detail in a three-part special report published a few days later. Rohde's reporting from Bosnia, according to the British journalist Henry Porter, \\"had a deep effect on the journalists who had covered the Bosnian civil war. They became not so much militarised as passionately committed to fighting Milosevic's regime ... if Rohde had not – at some personal risk – set out to prove the rumours about the massacres, a great truth would have been buried along with the thousands of men from Srebrenica.\\" Porter observed that \\"the extent of the slaughter might not have emerged if it had not been for the bravery of David Rohde.\\" Rohde went on to testify before the US House of Representatives Committee on Security and Cooperation in Europe in December 1995 on what he had seen at Srebrenica. He returned to Srebrenica with a group of Western reporters at the start of April 1996, reporting that \\"approximately 70 percent of the larger of the two mass graves and approximately 50 percent of the smaller of the two have been recently dug up\\" and that other evidence that he had seen the previous October had been removed. Also in April 1996, Rohde won the Polk Award for foreign reporting, being cited for \\"risking his life to uncover the Srebrenica massacres of Bosnian Muslims, the worst genocide in Europe since the Holocaust.\\" Shortly afterwards, Rohde was awarded the 1996 Pulitzer Prize \\"for his persistent on-site reporting of the massacre of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica. In 1997, Rohde published a widely acclaimed account of the massacre, Endgame: The Betrayal and Fall of Srebrenica, Europe's Worst Massacre Since World War II (published in paperback as A Safe Area: Srebrenica – Europe's Worst Massacre Since the Second World War). It was described as a \\"masterly\\" account of how \\"good – but conflicted and weakly held – Western intentions were swept away by the racist imperatives of the Serb leaders.\\" Writing in The Guardian, Julian Borger declared it to be \\"essential reading\\" and commented: \\"It is journalism at its committed best – painstaking, compassionate, full of telling detail and rigorous in its judgments.\\" Rohde's work was the subject of study by a class in \\"Elements of International Reporting\\" at Columbia University's journalism school in spring 2001. The study explained: \\"We felt that Rohde's work was ideal for a case study in reporting on gross human rights violations, presenting opportunities to study both the professional techniques and the moral issues that pertain to such work.\\" Detainees While at The New York Times, Rohde has written about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He has reported among other things on the hardships endured by men detained and released from the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. During 2004 and 2005 he wrote extensively on the treatment of detainees at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad and at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. He also broke the story of the full extent of the US Government's roundup of American Muslims following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The American Prospect noted: In April 2009, Rohde shared in a second Pulitzer Prize, awarded to the staff of The New York Times for \\"its masterful, groundbreaking coverage of America's deepening military and political challenges in Afghanistan and Pakistan, reporting frequently done under perilous conditions.\\" Kidnapping In November 2008, while in Afghanistan doing research for a book, Rohde and two associates were kidnapped by members of the Taliban. After being held captive for seven months and ten days, in June 2009 Rohde and one of his associates escaped and made their way to safety. The other associate escaped a month later. During his captivity, Rohde's colleagues at The New York Times appealed to other members of the news media not to publish any stories relating to the abduction. The resulting media blackout of Rohde's kidnapping has caused a wider debate about the responsibility to report news in a timely manner. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales complied with a request from the Times to maintain the blackout, which he did through several administrators. Recognition In January 2012, Rohde was named one of the International Press Institute's World Press Freedom Heroes.

This book is Kel's first appearance as a Knight of the Realm. Plot summary War with the neighboring country of Scanra is declared at last, and Kel finds herself in charge of a refugee camp. Her district commander, Lord Wyldon, has chosen not to place her in control of a border post or a portion of the army like the other knights, so she's certain that he wishes to keep her—who, as a woman, he views as inferior in combat to males—out of fighting. However, it is revealed that she was chosen for her post because she is the only knight Wyldon knows who wouldn't discriminate against those not of noble blood. Kel soon comes to realize that these refugees, torn from their homes, robbed of their wealth and self-respect, are her responsibility. She must feed them, house them, and keep them safe from harm far too close to the Scanran border. She is able to be a hero, even outside of the battlefield. In her work at the camp Kel names Haven, she receives help in the shape of her old friends Neal and Merric, the horses Peachblossom and Hoshi, the dog Jump, and her personal sparrow flock, as well as from a mixed myriad group of others: the Wildmage Daine; Daine's lover, the great mage Numair Salmalin; Neal's own father, Duke Baird of Queenscove; Kel's former knight-master Raoul of Goldenlake and Malorie's Peak; men of the King's Own (including Kel's friend and Neal's cousin Sergeant Domitan of Masbolle); convict soldiers who have been given the choice to fight in the army or to die at hard labor; several hundred disillusioned refugees who have received too many empty promises from nobles; smugglers; and a young, orphaned boy with wild magic for horses named Tobe. While Kel struggles with her responsibilities and the urge simply to abandon the camp and find a real fight, another obligation hangs over her. Before the war began, she was given a task by the Chamber of the Ordeal: to find and destroy the mage whose necromancy creates the giant, swift-moving, deadly metallic machines from the souls of children, known to the Tortallans as \\"killing devices.\\" But, tied to the camp, she cannot pursue it. However, as the summer wears on and the war intensifies, events move to put that perverted mage and his conscienceless war-leader in Kel's path, and at last her resolve is tested, and she and all of Tortall find out if she is truly worthy of her shield. After months of hard work with the refugees, Kel feels that they can sufficiently take care of the camp while she is gone for several days to deliver a requested oral report to Lord Wyldon. However, when Tobe is brought into the fort, tired from a long trek from Kel's refugee camp, she knows that something is wrong. The Scanrans have captured her people, and Kel believes that the children will be used to create the horrible metal killing devices terrorizing Tortall. Worse, Lord Wyldon forbids her to go after them. She is left with a choice: obey Wyldon's orders and leave her people for the killing devices, or go after them and presumably be declared a traitor. After burying the few dead at Haven, Kel tricks her guards into returning to Lord Wyldon without her, and begins what she believes will be a long and harrowing journey into enemy territory. Much to her surprise and dismay, she is soon joined by Neal, several of her other year-mates, Owen, Tobe, and members of the King's Own. They follow the path of the kidnapped refugees across the deadly Vassa river and into Scanra. A series of altercations result in the Scanran guards being depleted, and the rescue of the adult refugees and convict guards of Haven. Continuing to track the kidnapped children, they are led to Fief Rathhausak, and a final battle between the Tortallans and the Scanrans leaves Blayce dead, and the people of Rathhausak free from his tyranny. The Tortallans and villagers of Rathhausak return across the border to Tortall. In recompense for disobeying orders, she is ordered to build and command a new refugee camp, known as New Hope. Errata There is a minor continuity error between Lady Knight and Lioness Rampant, the fourth book in the earlier Song of the Lioness quartet, concerning the Chamber of the Ordeal. In Chapter One of Lady Knight (\\"Storm Warnings\\"), Kel's former knight master Raoul of Goldenlake tells her that no one has been allowed back inside the Chamber a second time in all of history.Pierce, Tamora, Lady Knight, New York: Random House, 2002, page 11. This conflicts with events in Chapter 8 of Lioness Rampant (\\"Crossroads in Time\\"), in which Jonathan of Conté enters the Chamber a second time for the Ordeal of Kings—his first experience being his Ordeal of Knighthood.Pierce, Tamora, Lioness Rampant, New York: Random House, 1988, page 262.

Because the name \\"John Jones\\" was one of the most common in Wales at the time, he is usually differentiated by others of the same name by the use of the suffix \\"Talysarn\\", denoting the village where he lived. Life John Jones was born in a house called Tanycastell, in Dolwyddelan, and brought up in a farming family but which also had many connections with Nonconformist religion. He was a monoglot Welsh language speaker, and the only formal education he received was at the Sabbath school. As a young man around 1820 he was engaged as a labourer building Thomas Telford's road from London to Holyhead (now known as the A5), and was heard by his fellow workers preaching on religious matters as he walked to work. In 1822 he moved to Talysarn to find work in the quarry, but was increasingly devoting himself to preaching. He was ordained in 1829. He would become widely known by the name \\"John Jones, Talysarn\\" after his adopted home village. He married Frances (Fanny) Edwards around this time and left the quarry as they kept a shop together - although in practice it was she who understood business and kept the shop, so that he could devote time to matters of religion. Between 1850 and 1852 he was a joint owner of the Dorothea Quarry but this was not to his taste. He died on 16 August 1857 and was buried at the parish graveyard in Llanllyfni. In the funeral procession were 8 doctors, 65 ministers, 70 deacons, 200 choristers and around 4,000 others with a further 2,000 who joined en route. His work In an age when Nonconformist preaching had been riven by doctrinal differences, John Jones spoke plainly on matters that concerned the common people. They considered him one of their own, which was the foundation of his widespread appeal. He was also a singer, and composed the hymn tune Llanllyfni. Genealogy John Jones was a member of a large family which has gone to some trouble, before and since, to record its genealogy. Both his father and mother were descended from the poet Angharad James. In the mid-nineteenth century several of his brothers and sisters and their offspring emigrated to the area around Cambria, Wisconsin, United States. As a result there is interest to this day from many in Wales and the USA in tracing their genealogy through this family.

She began her career writing and putting on plays, which were often censored by the Soviet government, and following perestroika, published a number of well-respected works of prose. She is best known for her plays, novels, including The Time: Night, and collections of short stories, notably There Once Lived a Woman Who Tried to Kill Her Neighbor’s Baby. In 2017, she published a memoir, The Girl from the Metropol Hotel. She is considered one of Russia's premier living literary figures, having been compared in style to Anton Chekhov and in influence to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.Groskop, Viv. \\"Russia's last writer,\\" Financial Times, January 14, 2011. Retrieved 2017-12-28 Her works have won a number of accolades, including the Russian Booker Prize, the Pushkin Prize, and the World Fantasy Award. Her creative interests and successes are wide-ranging, as she is also a singer and has worked in film animation, screenwriting, and as a painter.  Early life  Petrushevskaya was born in Moscow, USSR, on 26 May 1938, in the stately Metropol Hotel. She lived there with her family until 1941, when her father, a Bolshevik intellectual, was declared an enemy of the state. He abandoned Petrushevskaya and her mother, who were forced to flee the city for Kuibyshev (now Samara). Following this, Petrushevskaya recounts a harrowing early childhood spent in group homes, on the streets, and later in communal apartments. She states in The Girl from the Metropol Hotel that she earned the nickname \\"The Moscow Matchstick\\" from other children during this time, due to her thinness. At age nine, Petrushevskaya and her mother returned to Moscow, where she spent the rest of her childhood and adolescence. She attended Moscow State University, from which she graduated with a degree in journalism. Career Petrushevskaya is regarded as one of Russia's most prominent contemporary writers, and one of the most acclaimed writers at work in Eastern Europe; Publishers Weekly has stated that she is \\"generally considered to be one of the finest living Russian writers\\". In recent decades, her work has become increasingly well-known in the West. Her writing combines postmodernist trends with the psychological insights and parodic touches of writers such as Anton Chekhov. She spent most of her early career until perestroika writing and putting on plays rather than novels and stories, as the censorship of theater was often in practice less strict than that of written work. She recounts, nevertheless, being frequently monitored by the KGB, and facing resistance from Soviet censors to having her work performed. In an interview with the Financial Times, she recalls presenting an early work of prose to the prominent literary journal Novy Mir, and having it deemed too risky to publish: “They said they couldn’t protect me. Those were very bloody times ... If they had published me I would have had a terrible sort of fame. It would have been dangerous. I would have ended up in prison.\\" Nevertheless, she produced a number of respected plays, one of the most prominent of which is Andante. Additionally, in 1979, she was a co-writer for the influential Russian animated film, Tale of Tales; her influence in Russian film continued when she served as a jury member in the 3rd Open Russian Festival of Animated Film in 1998. Following Gorbachev-era governmental reforms, she began to publish novels and short stories that she had previously kept to herself. With her first collection of stories, Immortal Love, she \\"became a household name virtually overnight,\\" and published in Novy Mir as she had not been able to only a couple of decades earlier. Other later works include the novels The Time: Night (1992) and The Number One, both short-listed for the Russian Booker Prize. Since the late 1980s her plays, stories and novels have been published in more than 30 languages, and she has earned a number of accolades. In 2003 she was awarded the Pushkin Prize in Russian literature by the Alfred Toepfer Foundation in Germany. She was additionally awarded the Russian State Prize for arts in 2004, the Stanislavsky Award in 2005, and the Triumph Prize in 2006. There Once Lived a Woman who Tried to Kill Her Neighbor's Baby, a short story collection, was published in the U.S. by Penguin Books in October 2009 and became a New York Times Book Review bestseller in December of that year. In 2010, it won the World Fantasy Award for Best Collection. The first major translation of her work by an American publisher, the stories often contain mystical or allegorical elements which are used to illuminate bleak Soviet and post-Soviet living conditions. The collection of stories has been well reviewed, buttressing Petrushevskaya's reputation in the English-speaking world. An article in Dissent called the collection \\"a striking introduction to the author's work\\": > \\"Petrushevskaya's stories could easily be read as bleak grotesques, > populated by envious neighbors, selfish adolescents, and parents who > overcompensate with exaggerated love. But ultimately, Petrushevskaya's > skillful juxtapositions yield glints of light.

Petrushevskaya tends to shy away from praise of her literary achievements--in a 1993 interview with Sally Laird, she said, \\"Russia is a land of women Homers, women who tell their stories orally, just like that, without inventing anything. They're extraordinarily talented storytellers. I'm just a listener among them.\\"Sally Laird \\"Voices of Russian Literature: Interviews with Ten Contemporary Writers.\\" https://books.google.com/books?id=kxXogV0O1SoC&dq;=%22sally+laird%22&source;=gbs_navlinks_s She has also responded, according to Viv Gruskop, to her fame by stating, \\"It has nothing to do with me.\\" In her late 60s, Petrushevskaya started a singing career, creating new lyrics for her favorite songs. Since 2008, she has been regularly performing as a cabaret singer in Moscow (from nightclubs to major venues such as the Moscow House of Music) and across Russia, as well as internationally. She is known to sing French and German jazz songs, and recently has begun writing her own. Petrushevskaya is also known as a visual artist; her portraits, nudes, and still lifes have been shown in Russia's major museums, including the Tretyakov Gallery, Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, and State Museum of Literature, and private galleries.

Majken Johansson (August 7, 1930, Malmö - December 11, 1993) was a Swedish poet, writer and a Salvation Army soldier. Majken Johansson was born out of wedlock in Malmö, and spent her childhood in foster care with an abusive foster mother. At the age of 9, she was evacuated from Malmö at the outbreak of World War II and lived with relatives in Småland. Despite her difficult childhood she went through school with good grades and managed to get in at the prestigious Lund University, where she graduated. During her teenage and university years she also suffered from alcoholism. In 1956, after a stormy relationship with another woman, which ended with the woman committing suicide, Majken Johansson suffered a life crisis which would lead to her decision to join the Swedish section of the Salvation Army in 1958. She began to write in the early 1950s, both socially debating articles in newspapers, and poetry. Her first volume of poetry was the critically acclaimed Buskteater in 1952. She published 8 volumes of poetry between 1952 and 1989. Her poems are not only concerned with life, love and God, but also on everyday reflections in a very simple and keen way, often with a lot of humor. Her life partner was the Salvation Army officer and hymn writer Karin Hartman, who in 2002 published Bottenglädjen, a book about Majken Johansson's life. In recent years Johansson's poetry has been published in new editions and gained a generation of new readers. She is today regarded as one of Sweden's greatest poets of the mid-20th century, alongside names such as Hjalmar Gullberg and Werner Aspenström. In 1970 she was awarded the Large Prize by Samfundet De Nio. She was also awarded a literary prize by the magazine Vi in 1958, the Sveriges Radios poetry award in 1965, the Deverthska kulturstiftelsens Forsethpris in 1972, and the Sydsvenska Dagbladets kulturpris in 1975.

Plot summary Completed by Mirbeau's long-time friend Léon Werth, when the author's ill health prevented him from writing the concluding chapters, Dingo, Mirbeau's final novel, appeared in completed form with Fasquelle in 1913. An autobiographical fiction, Mirbeau's tale chronicles the author's adventures with his pet dog Dingo while simultaneously offering a jaundiced view of country life, in Ponteilles-en-Barcis, a squalid town modeled on the village of Cormeilles-en-Vexin, where Mirbeau had the misfortune to reside.  Commentary  Carrying on in the same vein as La 628-E8, in which the hero of the novel had been Mirbeau's automobile, Dingo again takes a non-human as its central character, the marauding, untamed creature that assumes mythical proportions in Mirbeau's book. Uncorrupted by social institutions, endowed with animal good sense, Dingo exposes the vices, duplicity, and venality of the local autochthons while also instructing his \\"master\\" in the virtue of living in harmony with the instincts. Despite praising his dog, Mirbeau offers an unromanticized image of the predatory beast, whose displays of goodness and affection are offset by murderous rampages, his wholesale slaughter of sheep and chickens. Herein Mirbeau shows that man and animal alike obey the \\"law of murder\\", whose operation Mirbeau had described in Le Jardin des supplices (Torture Garden).

The process is meant to add moisture to the dish, and some believe that steam from the beer serves to steam the chicken from the inside and add flavor to the dish. Some people are avid proponents of the dish, while others have contended that the efficacy of using the beer is overrated, and that the science regarding beer can chicken is debatable. It has been suggested that the dish possibly originated in the U.S. state of Louisiana. Overview Beer can chicken is a barbecued chicken dish and method of indirect grilling, in which an open can of beer or other canned beverage is inserted into the cavity of a chicken and then used to hold the chicken vertically while it cooks on a grill or in an oven. During the cooking process the beer in the can might steam, which might add moisture in the cavity of the bird, and some theorize that the beer vapor serves to add flavor to the dish. Because the chicken is in an upright position, the fat in the bird drains away and the skin is evenly cooked. Prior to cooking, some of the beer in the can is typically removed, with a partially-full can of beer placed inside the bird's cavity. Some cooks use a full can of beer. Some cooks use a standard 12-ounce beer (355 ml) can, while others use a tallboy beer can, a larger-sized can. The chicken is sometimes coated with a spice rub prior to cooking, and some use marinated chicken. Some people are enthusiastic proponents of the dish, while others feel that the dish and process is overrated. It has been stated that the efficacy of the beer serving to steam whole chickens from the inside and adding flavor is debatable. Some critics of beer can chicken exist; one critic referred to the practice as \\"dangerous\\" and \\"a waste of good beer\\". Another critic stated that the process may actually make the chicken drier compared to other types of roasting, and it has also been stated by some cooking experts that the beer does not reach a boiling point, and therefore does not steam. History It has been suggested by Steven Raichlen that beer can chicken possibly originated in the U.S. state of Louisiana. Beer can chicken is featured as a dish at some barbecue cooking competitions in the United States, and is served at some U.S. restaurants. As fast food In October 2014, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen purveyed a limited edition beer can chicken dish that was produced without the use of beer. The dish consisted of sliced chicken breast meat marinated in a spice mixture designed to mimic the flavor of beer can chicken, which was then battered and deep fried. The spice mixture was composed of butter, onion, garlic, rosemary, lemon zest, cayenne pepper and a \\"secret ingredient\\" that Popeyes did not disclose. The company's chief marketing officer stated to a press source that the company had \\"... been working on the Beer Can Chicken for years\\".

The badge, sometimes known as the \\"Discharge Badge\\", the \\"Wound Badge\\" or \\"Services Rendered Badge\\", was first issued in September 1916, along with an official certificate of entitlement. The large sterling silver lapel badge was intended to be worn on civilian clothes. The decoration was introduced as an award of \\"King's silver\\" for having received wounds or injury during loyal war service to the Crown's authority. A secondary causation for its introduction was that a practice had developed in the early years of the war in the United Kingdom where some women took it upon themselves to confront and publicly embarrass men of fighting age they saw in public places who were not in military uniform, by ostentatiously presenting them with white feathers, as a suggestion of cowardice. As the war had developed substantial numbers of servicemen who had been discharged from His Majesty's Forces with wounds that rendered them unfit for war service, but which were not obvious from their outward appearance, found themselves being harassed in such a manner and the badge, to be worn on the right breast while in civilian dress, was a means of discouraging such incidents being directed at ex-forces' personnel. It was forbidden to wear the badge on a military uniform. The badge bears the royal cypher \\"GRI\\" (for Georgius Rex Imperator; George, King and Emperor) and around the rim \\"For King and Empire - Services Rendered\\". Each badge was uniquely numbered on the reverse. The War Office maintained a register recording which serviceman each one had been issued to in United Kingdom, and the governments of Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Rhodesia maintained their own registers of issue (which were copied to the War Office in London to provide it with an Imperial master-record).This Master List was administratively destroyed by the Ministry of Defence later in the 20th Century, only a few pages of it are extant at The National Archives, in Kew, Surrey. Silver War Badges issued by the Empire's dominion nations had their identification numbers on the reverse prefixed with the first letter of the issuing nation: Australia with the letter 'A', Canada 'C', etc. In the United Kingdom the War Office made it known that it would not replace Silver War Badges if they were lost, however if one was handed into a police station then it would be returned to the War Office, which would seek to return it using its records to its recipient. A similar award called the King's Badge was issued in World War II. Although each was issued with a certificate, unlike its World War I counterpart it was not individually numbered. Silver War Badge - Medal Cards and Rolls The \\"SWB List\\" when mentioned on a medal card refers to a list that is now kept in The National Archives. There are two different types of cards on which the List can be mentioned. *The SWB can be shown on a normal medal card index as in the adjacent picture. Silver War Badge listed on a normal Medal Card *It can also be recorded on a new medal card issued for the purpose, called a Silver War Badge Card. If there is no Silver War Badge Card, then the details of the soldier's discharge can be found out by a visit to The National Archives at Kew. There should be a reference to a Silver War Badge Roll, for example in the picture above it says \\"SWB List TH/345\\" this refers to the roll in which the man is mentioned. On the Silver War Badge roll it should mention at the very least the number of the badge, the official reason and date of his discharge. A silver war badge card can be accessed online via The National Archives. On the card it should mention the date of discharge, the cause and the number of the badge (in many ways just like a Silver War Badge Roll but online, and therefore easier to access) Records for the Australian Imperial Force can be accessed via the Australian War Memorial. King's Regulations For Discharge A Silver War Badge Card There are 29 different ways in which someone could have been discharged under the King's Regulations. On a Silver War Badge Card, it could say KR (xxi) as it does on the example SWB card. This stands for King's Regulations, section 21. The different regulations are; * (i) References on enlistment being unsatisfactory. * (ii) Having been irregularly enlisted. * (iii) Not likely to become an efficient soldier. * (iv) Having been claimed as an apprentice. * (v) Having claimed it on payment of £10 within three months of his attestation. * (vi) Having made a mis-statement as to age on enlistment. * (vii) Having been claimed for wife desertion. * (viii) Having made a false answer on attestation. * (ix) Unfitted for the duties of the corps. * (x) Having been convicted by the civil power of_, or of an offence committed before enlistment. * (xi) For misconduct. * (xii) Having been sentenced to penal servitude. * (xiii) Having been sentenced to be discharged with ignominy. * (xiv) At his own request, on payment of _ under Article 1130 (i), Pay Warrant. * (xv) Free, after  years' service under Article 1130 (ii), Pay Warrant. * (xvi) No longer physically fit for war service. * (xvii) Surplus to military requirements (having suffered impairment since entry into the service). * (xviii) At his own request after 18 years' service (with a view to pension under the Pay Warrant). * (xix) For the benefit of the public service after 18 years' service (with a view to pension under the Pay Warrant). * (xx) Inefficiency after 18 years' service (with a view to pension under the Pay Warrant). * (xxi) The termination of his  period of engagement. * (xxii) With less than 21 years' service towards engagement, but with 21 or more years' service towards pension. * (xxiii) Having claimed discharge after three months' notice. * (xxiv) Having reached the age for discharge. * (xxv) His services being no longer required. * (xxvi) Surplus to military requirements (Not having suffered impairment since entry into the service). * (xxvii) At his own request after 21 (or more) years' service (with a view to pension under the Pay Warrant). * (xxviii) After 21 (or more) years' qualifying service for pension, and with 5 (or more) years' service as warrant officer (with a view to pension under the Pay Warrant). * (xxviv) On demobilization. Issued numbers Approximately 1,150,000 badges were issued, which had to be claimed and then approved, generally covered by §(xvi) above. The numbers on the back of the badge kept changing during the war. *Between September 1916 and March 1918, they were issued with just a number and were better quality than most stampings. Around 335,000 of these were issued. *Between March 1918 and September 1918, these were the second series. This took the number of badges issued up to 450,000. *Between September 1918 and December 1919, they had a 'B' prefix before the number. Around 450,000 of these were issued. *Between December 1919 and January 1920, they had a 'O' prefix, around 5,000 of these were issued. *Between January 1920 and March 1922, they went back to ordinary numbers again.

Guerrero wrote well over 100 plays, 41 of which have been published. His unpublished plays have either been broadcast over the radio or staged in various parts of the Philippines. His plays can be found in various anthologies: 13 Plays (first published in 1947), 8 Other Plays (1952), 7 More Plays (1962), 12 New Plays (1975), My Favorite 11 Plays (1976), 4 Latest Plays (1980), and Retribution and eight other selected plays (1990). Guerrero also published a family memoir, The Guerreros of Ermita (1988). Guerrero taught and trained many notable figures in the Philippine Performing Arts: Behn Cervantes, Celia Diaz-Laurel, Joy Virata, and Joonee Gamboa.Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero. ncca.gov.ph (June 3, 2015) Biography Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero was born in Ermita, Manila. He wrote his first play at the age of 14 in Spanish, entitled, \\"No Todo Es Risa.\\" This play was produced at the Ateneo de Manila University when he was 15. Guerrero worked as a reporter and proofreader for La Vanguardia, a Spanish newspaper, and as a drama critic for the Manila Tribune. He also worked for some time in the Philippine film industry as a scriptwriter. He served as director of the Filipino Players from 1941–1947. In 1947 he was appointed as Director of the Dramatic Club at the University of the Philippines despite not having a degree, and he held that position for sixteen years.Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero. Upreplib.tripod.com. Retrieved on January 5, 2018. In 1962, he organized and directed the U.P. Mobile Theater, which travels around the Philippines to give performances. Several of Guerrero's plays have been translated into and produced in Chinese, Italian, Spanish, Tagalog, Visayan, Ilocano and Waray. Six of his plays have been produced abroad: \\"Half an Hour in a Convent\\" at the Pasadena Playhouse, California; \\"Three Rats\\" at the University of Kansas; \\"Condemned\\" in Oahu, Hawaii; \\"One, Two, Three\\" (premiere performance) at the University of Washington, Seattle; \\"Wanted: A Chaperon\\" at the University of Hawaii; and \\"Conflict\\" in Sydney, Australia. He is the first Filipino to have a theater named after him within his lifetime: The Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero Theater of the University of the Philippines. =Childhood= Guerrero grew up in an affluent family. His father, Manuel Severino Guerrero, was renowned for having a “clinical eye” which could diagnose illness just by studying a person’s outside appearance. His father's clientele included some of Manila’s richest denizens: Brias Roxas, the Ayalas, Pardo de Taveras, the Zobels, the Roceses, the Osmeñas, the Alberts, et al. As a result, the young Wilfrido enjoyed a comfortable upbringing along with his brothers Renato, Edmundo, Lorenzo, and Manuel. As indicative of their social status, the Guerrero children were forbidden to eat with their hands (custom in certain households) and to converse in Tagalog. Guerrero was nearly seven when his father died. His father bequeathed the family their home at Plaza Ferguson, two cars (which his mother sold), and a Php10,000 life insurance payout. Five months after the funeral, the surviving family rented the first floor of the house belonging to his cousins, the Mossesgelds, for Php50.00. His mother in turn rented the Plaza Ferguson home to an American family to generate income. Guerrero and his brothers attended high school at the Ateneo in Intramuros. They became choristers to receive free tuition, but this required their presence at Mass every day. Even with their tuition exempt (Php60.00 per semester), they still needed money to purchase their textbooks. Guerrero completed his first play, the one-act \\"No Todo Es Risa,\\" during his second year of high school. He showed it to the late Father Juan Trinidad, S.J. (who at that time was translating the Bible into Tagalog), who decided to stage it for their Father Rector’s (Fr. O’Brien) birthday. By Wilfrido's third year at the Ateneo, he purportedly had his fill of hearing daily Mass. This emboldened him to approach Don Alejandro Roces, Sr., a patient of his father and husband of a close friend of his mother. Having heard Guerrero's proposal in his office at the Manila Tribune, Don Alejandro readily agreed, thereby paying Guerrero's tuition for his last two years in high school and ostensibly freeing him from daily Mass. =Writing career= It was Guerrero's favorite aunt, Maria Araceli, who discovered his writing ability. When he was 12 or 13 she noticed him writing on scraps of paper and then hiding them inside his cabinet drawer. After his aunt's death, Guerrero wrote some of his most popular comedies, \\"Movie Artists,\\" \\"Basketball Fight,\\" and \\"Wanted: A Chaperone.\\" He also made her the basis for the principal characters in \\"Forever\\" (Maria Teresa) and \\"Frustrations\\" (Maria Araceli). “Both women are like my aunt: imperious, strong-willed, wise, but also humane,” he wrote. ' =Awards= Guerrero received three national awards: the Rizal Pro-Patria Award in 1961, the Araw ng Maynila Award in 1969, and the Republic Cultural Heritage Award in 1972. The U.P. Mobile Theater received two awards when he was director: The Citizen's Council for Mass Media Trophy (1966) and the Balagtas Award (1969). In 1997, Guerrero was posthumously distinguished as a National Artist for Philippine Theatre.Guerrero, Wilfrido Ma. (1988) The Guerreros of Ermita: Family History and Personal Memoirs.

Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, District of Columbia Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). District of Columbia ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the District of Columbia Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the District of Columbia ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Mayor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. Components The District of Columbia Air National Guard consists of the following major unit: * 113th Wing : Established 10 April 1941 (as: 121st Observation Squadron); operates: F-16C/D Fighting Falcon, C-38A and C-40C : Stationed at: Joint Base Andrews, Camp Springs, Maryland : Gained by: Air Combat Command History The District of Columbia Air National Guard origins date to 10 April 1941 with the establishment of the 121st Observation Squadron and is oldest unit of the District of Columbia Air National Guard. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The 121st Observation Squadron was ordered into active service on 1 September 1941 as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps prior to the United States entry into World War II. On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units. Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 F-51H Mustangs of the 121st Fighter Squadron, 1949 The modern DC ANG received federal recognition on 26 October 1946 as the 121st Fighter Squadron at Andrews Army Airfield, Maryland. It was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of Washington, D.C. On 2 November 1946 the 113th Fighter Group was allotted by the National Guard Bureau, extended federal recognition and activated. The 121st was assigned to the 113th as its operational squadron. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the District of Columbia Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. On February 1, 1952, the 8205th Air Base Squadron was activated as part of the DC ANG. The unit's mission was to receive, maintain, and store equipment as well as provide trained personnel for the soon-to-be formed 231st Airways and Air Communications Squadron (Mobile) (which was to be stationed at Camp Simms, Washington, DC). However, the unit was discontinued on August 26, 1952, when it merged with the 231st AACS (Mobile). Under a variety of names, since 1986 the 231st Combat Communications Squadron, the 231st remained active with the DC ANG into the twenty-first century. Today, the District of Columbia Air National Guard primary mission is training of air combat and operational airlift crews for national defense. The 113th also provides a ready response force of fighters for the defense of the District of Columbia area 24/7. Members of the 113th also assist local and federal law enforcement agencies in combating drug trafficking in the District of Columbia on a case by case basis. After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit of the DC ANG were activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) air defense overflights of major United States cities. On 11 September 2001, the wing was given authorization for its pilots to shoot down threatening aircraft over Washington DC. During one of those missions, on 11 May 2005 the squadron scrambled to intercept an aircraft that wandered into the no-fly zone around the White House. Customs officials had also scrambled a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and a UC-35B Cessna Citation jet at 11:47 a.m. to intercept the plane. The Customs aircraft gave way when the F-16s arrived flew on the wing tips of the little plane. They dipped their wings - a pilot's signal to ‘follow me’ - and tried to raise the pilot on the radio. But the Cessna didn't change course and it was flying too slow for the F-16s. The frustrated pilots had to take turns dropping flares, breaking away and returning to drop more flares. One senior Bush administration counter-terrorism official said it was ‘a real finger-biting period’ because they came very close to ordering a shot against a general aircraft. Finally, when the Cessna came within three miles of the White House - just a few minutes flying time - it altered course Also, DC ANG units have been deployed overseas as part of Operation Northern and Southern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as well as other locations as directed. Special Recognition D.C. Air Guard's 231st CMBTCS won the Air National Guard Mission Support Trophy for the year 1995. The trophy is given annually to the number one non-flying unit in the Air National Guard. It was estimated at the time that 600 Air National Guard units were eligible for the award. The Mission Support Trophy is the equivalent of the Spaatz Trophy for Air National Guard flying units.

He played wide receiver for the Chicago Bears. Early life Brian Baschnagel's family relocated often due to his father's professional responsibilities and moved to the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania when he was in his early teens. Baschnagel attended North Allegheny High School (Pittsburgh PA) and was a running back on the North Allegheny football team. Baschnagel was the first running back in WPIAL history to rush for over 400 yards in a single game. According to an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Baschnagel rushed for 409 yards in a 1971 game against Sto Rox. According to an article in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Baschnagel then set a WPIAL rushing record that would stand for 17 years when he ran for 432 yards in a 1972 game. College Baschnagel attended The Ohio State University after graduating from North Allegheny High School. Initially, Baschnagel was a running back but then was converted to a receiver (wing back). In addition to his position as a starting player on the Ohio State football team, Baschnagel was a two-time Academic All-American (1974, 1975) and a recipient of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame scholarship award (1975). NFL Baschnagel was selected by the Chicago Bears in the third round of the 1976 NFL Draft. He wore jersey #47 in his rookie year, which he began as a defensive back, and #84 the remainder of his career with the Bears after moving back to receiver. Contrary to popular belief, Baschnagel was not on the active roster in 1985 when the Bears went 18–1 en route to a Super Bowl victory. He injured his knee in training camp and spent the entire 1985 season on IR. However, he did travel with the team that year, assisted the coaches from the coaching booth, and helped in practice after he recovered from his injury. He received a Super Bowl ring after the Bears' dominant Super Bowl XX win.

This is the first of the Joe Pitt Casebooks. Plot summary Already Dead follows the adventures of a vampyre named Joe Pitt as he tries to figure out a mysterious zombie epidemic stemming around New York. He has connections in Manhattan Underworld which make him a valuable item for clans. Joe is then asked to find the gothic daughter of a rich man, and is pressured to do the work. Meanwhile, a disease is spreading zombie like symptoms around the town, causing whoever is bitten (or infected) by this disease into \\"Shamblers\\", and it's up to Joe to find the mysterious carrier of this sickness. Aside from his line of work, Joe has a girlfriend named Evie, a human that is HIV positive, is currently terrified of any sexual contact since she's afraid of infecting him with the sickness. Joe knows how to cure her HIV, but fears the side effects; so he tries his best to keep his vampyrism a secret from her. Characters Joe Pitt: The main protagonist; a vampire who works as a freelance detective doing odd jobs for other clans around New York for some blood; namely The Society and The Enclave, but occasionally, The Coalition. He has a human girlfriend named Evie, who is HIV positive. However, he keeps his vampyrism secret from her. Evie: Joe's girlfriend, who's a redheaded waitress down at a bar he regulars at. She's also HIV positive, and refuses to get intimate with Joe out of fear of infecting him. Even though Joe knows the ultimate way to cure her, he's afraid of infecting her with the Vyrus and transforming her into a vampyre. Philip Sax: Joe's pompadoured \\"sidekick\\" of sorts, but he is used mainly for syphoning information for Joe's various cases. Unfortunately, he's rather dimwitted and flaky, which angers Joe most of the time and ends up getting beaten if he doesn't do as Joe asks. He wants to become a vampyre (or as Joe refers to him, a \\"Renfield\\"), but Joe believes he's far too dumb. Dexter Predo: A very powerful vampyre in charge of running The Coalition; the most prestigious clan in New York. Sometimes Joe takes odd jobs for him if he's in need of blood. Terry Bird: Head of The Society; a vampyre with something of a hippie complex. He harbors a fondness for Joe, and, unlike Predo, can see that Joe has a sharp wit, and acts as a bit of a father-figure to vampyres in need. His main three cohorts are Lydia, a gay-and-lesbian rights activist, Tom, an anarchist who has an extreme hatred for Joe, and his burly Irish bodyguard, Hurley. Daniel: Leader (and Elder) of the Enclave; a very old vampyre, but possibly one of the single most dangerous ones in Manhattan. He and his followers have made an art out of \\"starving\\" the Vyrus, so it could be stretched to its full potential in combat and survival. Tends to refer to Joe as by real name, \\"Simon\\", which usually aggravates him, but he believes Joe will be the one that eventually takes his place as leader.

Founded as a departmental honor society for French at the University of California, Berkeley in 1906, Pi Delta Phi is the oldest collegiate academic honor society for a modern foreign language in the United States. After many years as a local chapter, Pi Delta Phi reorganized and declared itself the National French Honor Society in 1920, and later chartered the Beta Chapter at the University of Southern California in 1925, and the Gamma Chapter at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1926. The society expanded slowly during the next fifteen years but enjoyed renewed interest after World War II. In 1949 the American Association of Teachers of French (AATF) endorsed the Society officially as the only collegiate French honor society in the United States. The society was admitted to membership in the Association of College Honor Societies in 1967. It currently numbers more than 380 chapters established at representative public and private colleges and universities in almost every state, as well as chapters in Paris and Aix-en-Provence. Purpose The purpose of the Society is: (1) to recognize outstanding scholarship in the French language and francophone literatures, (2) to increase the knowledge and appreciation of Americans for the cultural contributions of the French-speaking world, and (3) to stimulate and to encourage French and francophone cultural activities. Organization The Society's Executive Board, composed of elected regional Vice Presidents, is chaired by an elected President who appoints the Executive Director and Newsletter Editor. All Board positions are volunteer. The official publication of Pi Delta Phi is the Newsletter. The Society awards undergraduate scholarships for summer study in France and Québec to Regular undergraduate members of active chapters, and a graduate student scholarship for any study or research in a French-speaking country. Membership Regular members include undergraduate and graduate students at the sponsoring institution who are nominated in recognition of their academic achievement in French. Undergraduate or graduate candidates do not need to be French or French Studies majors or minors to be nominated for membership. The eligibility requirements for all undergraduate students are: completion of at least one course of upper division French (i.e. beyond the intermediate-level series of courses); 3.0 GPA in French, 3.0 GPA overall, AND rank in the top 35% of their class; and sophomore (second year) standing. Graduate students who are not already members of Pi Delta Phi are eligible for regular membership. The eligibility requirements for all graduate students are: completion of 2 graduate courses in French; and minimum 3.5 GPA in graduate coursework. Honorary members include: the French faculty of the sponsoring institution who are not already members of Pi Delta Phi; members of the faculty at large who are not already members of the Society; undergraduate and graduate students who do not meet the above requirements for regular membership; college or university alumni who did not become members while attending the sponsoring institution; and diplomats, community and business leaders, and others who have demonstrated support of French language, and/or of the cultures and literatures of the French-speaking world.

NEMO is a subunit of the IκB kinase complex that activates NF-κB. The human gene for IKBKG is located on chromosome Xq28. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.  Function  NEMO (IKK-γ) is the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which activates NF-κB resulting in activation of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, cell survival, and other pathways.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the IKBKG gene results in incontinentia pigmenti, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and several other types of immunodeficiencies. Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked dominant disease caused by a mutation in the IKBKG gene. Since IKBKG helps activate NF-κB, which protects cells against TNF-alpha induced apoptosis, a lack of IKBKG (and hence a lack of active NF-κB) makes cells more prone to apoptosis. Moreover, NEMO has been shown to play a role in preeclampsia and may offer insights into the genetic etiology of this condition. An increased level of NEMO gene expression was found in the blood of pregnant women with preeclampsia and their children. However, a decrease of the mRNA levels of total NEMO and the transcripts 1A, 1B, and 1C in placentas derived from preeclamptic women may be the main reason for intensified apoptosis. Sanger sequencing has indicated two distinct variations in the 3’ UTR region of the NEMO gene in preeclamptic women (IKBKG:c.*368C>A and IKBKG:c.*402C>T). The occurrence of a maternal TT genotype and either a TT genotype in the daughter or T allele in the son increases the risk of preeclampsia by 2.59 fold. The configuration of those maternal and fetal genotypes (TT mother/TT daughter or TT mother/T son) is also associated with the level of NEMO gene expression. NEMO deficiency syndrome is a rare genetic condition relating to a fault in IKBKG. It mostly affects males and has a highly variable set of symptoms and prognoses.NEMO deficiency syndrome information, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children  As a drug target  A drug called NEMO Binding Domain (NBD) has been designed to inhibit activation of NF-κB. NBD is a peptide that acts by binding to regulatory subunit NEMO (IKK-γ) thereby preventing it from binding subunits IKK-α and IKK-β and activating the IKK complex. In the absence of regulatory subunit IKK-γ the IKK complex is inactive, preventing the downstream signal transduction cascade leading to NF-κB activation. Binding of IKK-γ to IKK-α and IKK-β subunits activates the IKK complex leading to phosphorylation of IκB kinase, IκBα, and release of NF-κB dimers p105 and RELA to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of NF-κB responsive genes. In the presence of the NBD peptide, the IKK complex remains inactive and IκBα sequesters NF-κB dimers in the cytoplasm inhibiting transcription of NF-κB responsive genes. While NF-κB inhibitory drugs have previously been attractive to disease such as chronic inflammation and diabetes, specific cancers have been shown to have constitutive NF-κB activity. Advanced B-cell lymphoma (ABC), a subtype of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been shown to have fundamental and upregulated NF-κB activity. ABC lymphoma also has the lowest survival rate compared to DLBCL subtypes, Germinal Center B-cell-like and Undefined Type 3 lymphoma, highlighting the great clinical need to define targets for cancer therapy. Notably, the NBD peptide targets the inflammation induced NF-κB activation pathway sparing the protective functions of basal NF-κB activity allowing for greater therapeutic value and fewer undesired side effects. The NBD peptide was designed by identifying the amino acid binding sequence on IKK-α and IKK-β to which NEMO binds. A small region on the carboxyl terminus of IKK-α (L738-L743) and IKK-β (L737-L742) is essential for a stable interaction with NEMO and for the assembly of the active IKK complex. Henceforth this region is called the NEMO binding domain (NBD). The NBD peptide consists of the region from T735 to E745 of the IKK-β subunit fused with a sequence derived from the Antennapedia homeodomain that mediates membrane translocation. Furthermore, wild type NBD peptide has been shown to dose-dependently inhibit interaction of IKKB with NEMO compared to mutant controls. Additionally, NF-κB activation was suppressed in HeLa cells after incubation with NBD wild type peptides. Moreover, to better understand the potential efficacy of the NBD peptide in suppressing inflammation, NBD peptide was tested on collagen induced rheumatoid arthritis mouse models. Notably, aberrant NF-κB activity is strongly associated with many aspects of the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis. Mice injected with wild-type NBD peptide showed only slightly visual signs of paw and joint swelling whereas mice injected with PBS or mutant NBD control peptides developed severe joint inflammation. Additionally, analysis of the number of osteoclasts present in the joints of rheumatoid arthritic showed to be more prevalent in mice treated with PBS or the mutant NBD peptide compared to the NBD wild type peptide. Markedly, throughout the mouse model studies neither toxicity or lethality nor damage to kidneys or livers, was observed. Despite the potential for NBD peptide as a viable NF- κB inhibitory drug, disadvantages arise because of its peptide form. Peptides as drugs lack membrane permeability, are poorly orally viable, and generally have lower metabolic stability than small molecule drugs. Therefore, the NBD peptide is unable to be an orally available compound and must be administered either intravenously or via intraperitoneal injection.

Askville went into beta testing in October 2006 and launched to the public in November 2007. In August 2008, members of the Askville community complained of a lack of moderation and participation from the Askville administrators. In response, Askville appointed a community manager to track and handle user feedback, and the site management made a commitment to more effectively enforce their policies. The voting system underwent a major revision, including the addition of anonymous voting. In December 2008, Amazon announced that work on Questville, a planned addition to Askville, would be postponed indefinitely. In 2011, Amazon filed a new trademark application on Questville, and reactivated the Questville blog. On March 23, 2012, the staff announced that after almost seven years, Askville Bonus questions would cease being offered to Amazon Mechanical Turk in early April 2012 due to a change in operating strategies.

Unlike other Question-and-answer sites, Askville evolved into a social community as well as an information site. This was primarily due to the discussion boards, where \\"Askvillians\\" entered into long discussions sparked by individual questions. Though sparked by the questions, discussions often took on a personality of their own. No \\"experience points\\" or \\"quest gold\\" were awarded for discussions, but many Askvillians came to value the give-and-take, the bickering, and especially the supportive friendships made there. The questions were 120 characters-long maximum, with a description field that allowed 1000 characters for full explanation of the question. Questions were tagged for tag-based search capacity. Questions were associated to 2 of the 6 topics covered by Askville.  Askville Awards  Askville launched the Askville Awards in April 2009. These awards were an attempt by Askville to reward its longstanding and active members and motivate the newer members. There were several different awards, including the Veteran Award and the Orientation Award. The former was for members who had been with Askville for a year or more, and the latter was for the members who were new to the site. Awards showed up on the public profiles of all members.

Skeppsbrokajen (Swedish: \\"Ship's Bridge's Quay\\") is a quay in central Stockholm, Sweden. Passing along Skeppsbron, it forms the east waterfront of the old town Gamla stan.  History  The steamships S/S Blidösund and Saltsjön moored on Skeppsbrokajen. Skeppsbrokajen was preceded by a medieval quay called Koggabron (\\"Cog bridge\\") located a hundred metres inland from the present quay and only stretching along the southern part of the shore. During the 1630s, the work on the foundations of the present quay were begun, probably initiated by King Gustavus Adolphus. While the present name came into use during the period 1640–1700, the quay itself was not completed until 1854 when the area around Slussen was developed in connection to the construction of the lock of Nils Ericson. While the quay is still frequently used by ships, including international cruisers and locally well-known ships: a couple of old steamships, such as SS Blidösund (1911) and SS Saltsjön (1925); and some somewhat less genuine, such as MS Teaterskeppet, (\\"The Theatre Ship\\"), a Portuguese fishing boat built in 1959, today serving as a conference centre; and Svea Viking, originally a minesweeper built in the UK in 1943 for D-Day, then serving as ferry on Öland for many years before being transformed into a Viking ship in 1996. In the northern end of the quay, next to the Royal Palace is the statue of King Gustav III by Tobias Sergel inaugurated in 1808, and in the southern end is the sculpture Sjöodjuret (\\"Sea monster\\") by Carl Milles.

In cancer studies, Fenretinide treatment may cause ceramide (a wax-like substance) to build up in tumor cells and is associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in cell death through apoptosis and/or necrosis. Fenretinide accumulates preferentially in fatty tissue such as the breast, which may contribute to the effectiveness of fenretinide against breast cancer. Phase III clinical trial data has suggested that fenretinide reduces breast cancer relapse in pre-menopausal women. Common side effects associated with fenretinide treatment include skin dryness and night-blindness, which is reversible upon cessation of treatment. Specific types of cancer under investigation include or have included ovarian, prostate, cervical, lung, renal, bladder, breast, glioma, skin, head and neck carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and Ewing's sarcoma.

It opened in August 1981. At of gross leasable area, it is the largest mall in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area of southeastern Virginia and one of the largest malls on the East Coast. The mall contains more than 180 stores, including Dillard's, JCPenney, and Macy's as main anchor stores. Other stores and junior anchors at the mall include Apple, Barnes & Noble, Dick's Sporting Goods, L.L. Bean, XXI Forever, H&M;, and Old Navy. Dave & Busters is also a recent addition to the mall and region. An 18 screen AMC Theatres complex anchors an open-air pedestrian plaza. The mall is managed by Brookfield Properties Retail Group of Chicago, Illinois. History Lynnhaven mall opened in 1981. The mall was built by Melvin Simon & Associates (now Simon Property Group) of Indianapolis, Indiana, on Lynnhaven Parkway south of Interstate 264 (then State Route 44). The mall originally included six anchor stores: national chains JCPenney and Montgomery Ward, as well as regional chains Rices Nachmans, Thalhimers, Miller & Rhoads and Leggett. Over time, all of the anchors with the exception JCPenney were changed several times. The first to change was Rices Nachmans, which became Hess's in 1984. Miller & Rhoads closed in 1990 as part of the chain's bankruptcy, and was converted to Hecht's that year. Hess's closed at Lynnhaven Mall on March 30, 1991, as part of a corporate decision to eliminate smaller and underperforming stores. Its location was then sold to the Limited Brands, who converted the space to several of their brands, including The Limited superstore which opened in early 1992. Thalhimers closed in 1992 as well, and became a second Hecht's location. The two Hecht's stores remained until 1998, when the chain built a new location between Dillard's and Montgomery Ward Leggett was sold to Belk in 1997; one year later, the store was transferred to Dillard's as part of a mutual exchange. Dillard's also acquired the former Thalhimers, placing its women's departments in one and men's departments in the other. In addition, Lord & Taylor opened a new location at the mall in 1999 replacing the old Miller & Rhoads/Hecht's. =2000s= Montgomery Ward closed in 2001 with the chain's bankruptcy. Simon sold the mall to General Growth Properties (now Brookfield Properties Retail Group) of Chicago, Illinois in 2003 for $256.6 million. DSW Shoe Warehouse also opened. Lord & Taylor closed in early 2005, citing market conditions, and has remained vacant since then.http://hamptonroads.com/2011/03/six-years-lynnhaven-mall-anchor-spot- still-vacant The Montgomery Ward space at the mall was divided among Dick's Sporting Goods, Barnes & Noble and Steve & Barry's between 2003-2005. Dillard's expanded the former Thalhimers/Hecht's and moved into it in 2005 so as to vacate the former Leggett/Belk. That space was then demolished and rebuilt into an outdoor plaza called The Inlet anchored by an AMC Theatres complex. Hecht's, another nameplate of May Company, was converted to Macy's in 2006 when Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) acquired the May Company and converted several May nameplates to the Macy's brand. H&M; also opened in a portion of the former Hess's space when The Limited moved to a new location, and Steve & Barry's closed on January 30, 2009 with the company's liquidation and became Furniture Mart in 2010. DSW Shoe Warehouse moved out as well, and was replaced by a Forever 21. In 2012, Furniture Mart closed and moved elsewhere in the city. In its place, a newcomer to the area, Dave & Busters, opened on July 20, 2013. At the end of 2013, the mall's carousel, which greeted shoppers at the main entrance for 17 years, was removed to make way for a planned renovation.http://hamptonroads.com/2013/12/carousel-leave- lynnhaven-mall-after-17-years The renovation, announced in January 2014, added 29,000 square feet to the mall, including a new ground-level food court and an open atrium. The new food court opened October 27, 2014; the same day, the remaining mezzanine was closed for demolition.http://hamptonroads.com/2014/01/lynnhaven-mall-plans-major-remodel- new-food-court Apple opened a brand new store near Sephora in September 2014, marking the second Apple Store to come to the Hampton Roads area (the first being at MacArthur Center). At the same time as the mezzanine was being dismantled, the abandoned Miller & Rhoads/Hecht's/Lord & Taylor anchor was mostly torn down and rebuilt. The space was partitioned into two smaller sections and a public entrance. The public entrance opened in October 2015. L. L. Bean moved into the south half of the rebuilt space and opened on June 10, 2016, and most of the north half is taken up by a Maggie McFly's restaurant (the first outside of Connecticut) that opened in May 2017. With all but one of the connector bridges removed due to the renovations, the upper parking deck was no longer being used effectively, so it was partially demolished from March to June 2016. Only the section in front of JCPenney and its intact bridge remains. The area opened by the demolition has been leveled and reverted to open-air parking.

Fiesel had recently been removed from his mother's care by child protective services, and placed into foster care with David and Liz Carroll in Union Township, where he died from hyperthermia after being restrained and neglected in a closet for a two-day period. On February 21, 2007, Liz Carroll was convicted of murdering him. On February 26, 2007, it was announced attorneys for David Carroll had reached a plea agreement. Background Marcus Fiesel was born on June 24, 2003, and spent the first three years of his life in Middletown, Ohio, with his mother Donna Trevino (née Fiesel) and his two siblings, Michael and Peaches. He was described by a neighbor as \\"an awesome little guy\\" who loved flowers, Bob the Builder, and bubbles. According to friends, Fiesel was autistic and attended a school for special needs children. Fiesel was a very active child, and his mother found it difficult to cope with him, and a neighbor said she occasionally saw Trevino weeping with exhaustion. Frequent calls to the police were made to the home as Trevino was a regular victim of domestic violence at the hands of her boyfriend, and during these visits police officers noticed that the home was infested with fleas and reeked of feces. On September 29, 2005, police observed severe bruising on Fiesel's left buttock, and the family was also being investigated by child welfare workers who had received complaints of abuse. In January 2006, Fiesel crawled out of his second-story window and fell off the roof, resulting in a cut to his chin that required stitches. In April 2006, Fiesel was found wandering the streets and was almost hit by a car. Trevino told police that \\"she didn't know if she could care for her children any more and that it was getting to be too much for her.\\" She handed them over to Butler County. =Foster care= Lifeway for Youth, a private agency contracted by the state foster care system, placed Fiesel in the care of foster parents Liz and David Carroll, a couple from Union Township in nearby Clermont County. At the time, Lifeway for Youth were unaware that David Carroll had a mental health issue that would have disqualified him from foster parenting if known, and that a third adult, Amy Baker, said to be the Carrolls' girlfriend, was living in the home. In June 2006, David Carroll was arrested on a domestic violence charge that was later dismissed, and did not report the arrest to Lifeway for Youth as required. Family and friends said that David Carroll did not like Fiesel and was jealous of his \\"constant\\" need for attention from Liz Carroll and Baker. At one point, Carroll left his wife because he was not sure he wanted a life with her raising foster children. When he moved back in with his wife, he brought Baker with him. Disappearance Liz Carroll reported that Fiesel had gone missing on August 15, 2006. She said that she had she blacked out due to low blood pressure at Juilf's Park in neighboring Anderson Township, where she was with four children: a child she had with David Carroll, another foster child, a toddler she was babysitting, and Fiesel. Carroll said when she regained consciousness, Fiesel was missing. Hundreds of people, and search dogs, searched the area as part of the official search for Fiesel. Thousands more searched surrounding neighborhoods independent of the official search. On August 22, 2006, Liz Carroll held a press conference asking that whoever may have taken Fiesel return him. She said, \\"I need help from the public to help my son, Marcus is my son. I know people think foster care is temporary, but please return him to a hospital. [...] Waking up every morning and not having him run to me is very difficult. I am closer than his birth mother to him.\\" Because no witnesses reported seeing Fiesel in the park with Liz Carroll on August 15, and no trace of him was found, police and the public grew suspicious of Liz and David Carroll's claims. Discovery of Fiesel's death Fiesel's incinerated remains were discovered on an estate owned by Mike Cales in Brown County, Ohio. Police said that Liz and David Carroll had left Fiesel locked in a closet, bound with a blanket and packing tape, while they attended a family reunion in Williamstown, Kentucky on August 4–6, 2006. This was confirmed by Liz Carroll in testimony before a grand jury on August 28, 2006; she claimed, \\"I didn't have any intentions of hurting him.\\" Fiesel was left without food or water, but authorities believed he was killed by heat rather than dehydration or starvation, as temperatures in the closet may have reached . They found him dead when they returned home. Authorities believed it was David Carroll and Amy Baker who incinerated Fiesel's body. Amy Baker was granted immunity in Ohio in return for testimony, but is currently facing extradition from Ohio to Kentucky for a tampering with evidence charge brought against her by Mason County. Amy Baker confessed to helping to dispose of the body in the Ohio River, but charges against her have now been dropped. Charges against Liz and David Carroll Both Liz and David Carroll were indicted in Clermont County and Hamilton County for playing a part in Fiesel's death and hindering the police investigation into Fiesel's disappearance. On August 28, 2006 Liz and David Carroll were indicted by a Hamilton County Grand Jury on two counts of child endangerment, and one count of involuntary manslaughter. David Carroll was charged with an additional count of gross abuse of a corpse.Foster boy dead; Foster parents charged with involuntary manslaughter , WCPO- TVHamilton County Court Record for David Carroll, Hamilton County Clerk of CourtsHamilton County Court Record for Liz Carroll, Hamilton County Clerk of Courts A day later on August 29, 2006 additional Hamilton County indictments were made against the Carrolls. Both David and Liz were charged on one count of making false alarms, and one count of inducing panic. Furthermore, David was charged with one count of gross abuse of a corpse. Liz was charged with two additional charges of perjury.New charges, information in Fiesel case , WCPO-TV On September 1, 2006 Clermont County Prosecutor Don White and Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters held a joint press conference, where they discussed plans for prosecuting the defendants. All murder and/or homicide charges were to be prosecuted by Clermont County, since Fiesel's death occurred inside the Carroll's Union Township home. However, since State of Ohio contends the Carrolls attempted to cover up Fiesel's death in Anderson Township in Hamilton County, all charges related to inducing panic and covering up the death of the child would be prosecuted in Hamilton County.Carrolls to be tried in both Clermont and Hamilton counties , WCPO-TV Several days later on September 6, 2006, a Clermont County grand jury indicted David Carroll on eight criminal counts. The charges against the Carrolls included: murder (1 count each), involuntary manslaughter (1 count each), kidnapping (1 count each), felonious assault (1 count each), endangering children (3 counts each). David Carroll was also charged with one count of gross abuse of a corpse.Clermont County Court Record for David Carroll , Clermont County Clerk of CourtsClermont County Court Record for Liz Carroll , Clermont County Clerk of Courts Trials Liz Carroll was found guilty of all charges on February 21, 2007. The jury, made up of nine women and four men, deliberated for 4-6 hours. The trial lasted for 10 days beginning on February 12, 2007 and ending on February 21, 2007. Her lawyer Gregory A. Cohen promised to appeal. The appeal was also over a report that a juror reportedly said in an interview that she \\"knew in her heart Liz Carroll was guilty\\". During closing comments the assistant prosecutor Daniel Breyer said \\"They say you wouldn't treat a dog like that, and you know what? She [Liz] wouldn't! She took the dog with her. She took the dog with her.\\" He referred to the Carrolls taking their dog with them to their family reunion, but leaving Fiesel at home. After the assistant prosecutor's closing remarks Liz Carroll said: \\"The dog was alive!\\" She was sentenced to 54 years to life on February 22, 2007. After accepting a plea deal, David Carroll pleaded guilty to murder and gross abuse of a corpse. The judge accepted his plea, and sentenced Carroll to 15 years to life in prison. Carroll said that Amy Baker bound Fiesel, but he admitted he was present. On Friday, April 20, 2007, the Commonwealth of Kentucky charged Amy Baker with tampering evidence. Prosecutors in Kentucky claim that the immunity she was given was only with the state of Ohio and Kentucky has jurisdiction over the Ohio river. She waived extradition and defended charges brought against her in Kentucky, which carry a maximum five- year sentence. Her attorneys are moved both to dismiss all charges against her and to suppress all testimony given by her in the prosecutions of Liz and David Carroll and alleged that the Kentucky prosecutor promised Ohio prosecutors to give Amy Baker immunity in Kentucky as well. Her trial was set for November 7, 2007, in Maysville, Kentucky. Her charges were then dropped in early 2008. Memorials On Saturday, April 21, 2007, the chimney which was used to burn Fiesel's remains was demolished and turned into a memorial to him in a peaceful setting. Hanlon Park-Georgetown, OH, a Bench was dedicated to his memory on what would have been his 4th birthday, June 24, 2007. Effects on foster care in Ohio The case of Fiesel's death has led to many questions over the placement of foster children within the state of Ohio and elsewhere. Lifeway, the agency that placed Fiesel with the Carrolls, had its license revoked. Several bills have been put before the United States Congress and investigations continue into why Fiesel was placed with the Carrolls. Many placement organizations have since modified their procedures and intensified their background screening for potential foster parents. In all, state legislators, foster care workers, and child advocates have recommended 55 changes to Ohio's foster care system.

Azazi was commissioned 2nd Lieutenant on 14 December 1974. At the end of the combined training he won the bronze medal for being first in Art subjects. He has served as a Brigade Intelligence Officer, Divisional Intelligence Officer and Colonel Coordination, Headquarters Directorate of Military Intelligence. He was assistant Defence Attaché at the Embassy of Nigeria, Washington DC, United States for three years. He served as a member of the Directing Staff of the Command and Staff College from where he was posted to Lagos Garrison Command as the Intelligence Officer and subsequently to the Directorate of Military Intelligence as Colonel Coordination. He was later posted to the Training and Doctrine Command as Colonel Research and Development and then Director of Training. On graduation from War College, he was appointed Colonel General Staff, 81 Division of the Nigerian Army and later Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence, Defence Intelligence Agency. General Azazi also served as a member of Directing Staff of the National War College Abuja, rising later to become its Principal Staff Officer Coordination. He was appointed Director of Military Intelligence in 2003. He was appointed Chairman of the Committee of Nigerian Army in the Next Decade in May 2004. He was appointed the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division, Nigerian Army in January 2005, and subsequently appointed Chief of Army Staff in June 2006. He was an external examiner at the National War College and a Guest Lecturer on Military Operations Other Than War and Revolution in Military Affairs. General Azazi was a member of Nigeria’s Defence Policy Review Committee 2000/2001. Azazi had for some time had one of the fastest growing military careers in the history of present-day democratic Nigeria, between May, 2006 and June, 2007 the General had worn the ranks of Major General, Lieutenant General and General. General Azazi held an MSc in Strategic Studies from the University of Ibadan, and completed the Staff Intelligence and Security Course, School of Service Intelligence, Ashford, Kent, United Kingdom and Combined Strategic Intelligence Training Programme, Defence Intelligence College, Washington DC, United States. He is a graduate of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College Nigeria, and the National War College, Nigeria where he won the President and Commander-in-Chief's merit award for best all round performance. On 20 August 2008 Umaru Yar'Adua replaced Azazi with Paul Dike as CDS and announced Azazi's retirement from military service. National Security Adviser Azazi emerged from retirement to assume the National Security Adviser (NSA) post as a civilian. He inherited a range of challenges from extremists, including the militant Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) in his native region, and the rise of a new violent Islamist group called Boko Haram, which first emerged in 2009. Shortly after taking office, Azazi presided over the interception and public exposure of a large illegal shipment of weapons from the Islamic Republic of Iran. He did not speculate publicly on the origin of the weapons, and left it up to the Foreign Ministry to make the official allegation before the United Nations. News accounts differ as to the destination of the arms, with Israeli reports saying they were headed for Gaza, and others, including Nigerian government sources, saying they were to be smuggled elsewhere in West Africa, including to rebels based in Senegal and Gambia. Nigerian officials arrested an Iranian national reported to be a senior officer with the Qods Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and placed him on trial. The Iranian government called the shipments a \\"misunderstanding.\\" As National Security Adviser, Azazi worked with other countries, notably African neighbors, European countries and the United States, toward developing a new security and counterterrorism strategy. In the autumn of 2010, he met with then-CIA Director Leon Panetta at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. In August 2011, Azazi held meetings with US AFRICOM Commander Gen. Carter F. Ham about American training and sharing intelligence to combat Boko Haram and Niger Delta extremists. He attended a CIA event in California in November. On Christmas Day, 2011, the White House confirmed that U.S. officials had been in communication with top Nigerian officials to combat terrorism. Azazi took a systematic approach to the reform of Nigeria's security and intelligence apparatus, with a low-key demeanor that some critics termed as indifference. He was quoted as having said in effect that real reform comes with human development of national security personnel and officials and greater citizen participation, and not with mere documents, statements, and bureaucratic or leadership rearrangements. The few public statements Azazi made as the national security advisor on terrorism matters tended to be cautious and nuanced. Azazi appeared to prefer allowing the Foreign Ministry and judicial system to make definitive statements to the public, which led some critics to allege that he had not been attentive to counterterrorism matters. In contrast to his public persona, Azazi was reported to be aggressive behind the scenes. Nigeria's State Security Service (SSS), which reports to Azazi, took what observers consider an unusual step in November 2011 by arresting a federal senator and charging him with aiding Boko Haram. That senator, Mohammed Ali Ndume, had switched political affiliations to become a member of President Jonathan's own party. After Senator Ndume's arrest, a federal court in December 2011 ordered the politician jailed in expectation of a trial in 2012.Ahuraka Isah, \\"Federal High Court Ordered Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume to Kuje Prison,\\" AllAfrica.com, December 16, 2011. Azazi appeared to be studying extremist threat doctrine in his shaping of a national response to Islamist extremism. Islam in Nigeria takes many forms, and Azazi sought to differentiate among them. After the Christmas 2011 Boko Haram bombings of churches, Azazi strongly cautioned fellow Christians against talk of retaliation against Muslims or even wider religious warfare. He called on citizens to question the strategic intentions of the perpetrators, and said that counterterrorism policy must address those strategic intentions. Discussing Boko Haram and its strategy to incite retaliatory sectarian violence, Azazi said, \\"Have we thought of what their ultimate intentions are? Why will somebody go on to bomb Christians on a Christmas Day? Look at the ultimate intentions. Do they want to really raise tempers elsewhere?\\"Ahamefula Ogbu and Seriki Adinoyi, \\"In Jos, Christian, Muslim Leaders Seal Peace Deal,\\" This Day Live (Lagos, Nigeria), December 28, 2011. Boko Haram terms Nigeria an \\"enemy of Islam\\" and seeks the disintegration of Nigeria as a country. Rather than pursue counterterrorism solutions that would require mass policing of the country, Azazi stressed public participation in monitoring extremism and in assisting the security services.\\"Azazi Rules Out Changes in Leadership of Security Agencies,\\" Nigerian Tribune, December 28, 2011. In January 2012, Azazi praised the bipartisan findings of a homeland security subcommittee of the U.S. Congress that characterized Boko Haram as a threat to him and the \\"U.S. homeland which him and Governor Yakowa was gunned down by the Boko Haram and he escaped death while yakowa died.\\" The subcommittee report urged stronger U.S. intelligence and counterterrorism ties with Nigeria.\\"Boko Haram: Emerging Threat to the U.S. Homeland,\\" Report of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of Representatives, November 30, 2011. Azazi publicly voiced support for a strategic security relationship with the United States in an essay he authored for the Washington Times.Owoye Andrew Azazi, \\"Combating a Common Terrorist Threat: Time for a Strategic Security Relationship Between the U.S. and Nigeria,\\" Washington Times, January 5, 2012. Personal life and death Azazi was married with five children, three sons-in-law, two daughters-in-law, a grand daughter and two grandsons. His hobbies included reading biographies, Nigerian music and playing squash. On 15 December 2012 Azazi died along with Governor Patrick Yakowa of Kaduna state in a naval helicopter crash in Okoroba Village of Bayelsa State while on their way back to the Port-Harcourt Airport from the funeral of Oronto Douglas's father. http://tweetbuzz.us/entry/133653597/www.leadership.ng/nga/articles/42664/2012/12/15/update_gov_yakowa_azazi_4_others_killed_helicopter_crash.html Honors and Military Decorations * Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR) * Grand Service Star (GSS) * Distinguished Service Star (DSS) * Meritorious Service Star (MSS) * Force Service Star (FSS) * Corps Medal of Honour (CMH) * Pass Staff Course Dagger (PSC+) * National Defence College Dagger (NDC+) * President and Commander in Chief's Merit Award Lectures and participations His recent seminar and conference highlights include: *Keynote speaker at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies,National Defence University, Washington DC, January 2009 *Addressed a Seminar at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, National Defence University, Washington DC, September 2008 on Defense Transformation in Africa. *Participant at the Forum on African Exit Strategies, Institute for Higher National Defence Studies (IHEDN), Paris, June 2004 *Member Curriculum Review Workshop for Senior Leadership Seminar on the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies/National Defence University, USA *Facilitator, Seminar on Energy and Security in Africa March 2005 *Participant in the OECD/DAC Workshop on Security System Reforms held in Ghana in December 2005 He was recently a guest lecturer at the Department of Psychology of the Post-Graduate School, University of Ibadan and the Friedrich Ebert Siftung Institute Sensitization Training Workshop for Experts and Personnel in the Security Sector in West Africa.

He held the distinction of firing the first shots in defense of the United States during World War II.  Biography  Outerbridge was born in Victoria, Hong Kong, and was raised in Middleport, Ohio. He attended Middleport High School and graduated from Marion Military Institute in Alabama. He was then appointed to the United States Naval Academy from which he graduated in 1927. He served in various capacities on ships and ashore, including 3½ years on the China Station (1937–40) aboard the heavy cruiser . In 1940-41 he was Executive Officer of the destroyer , and on December 5, 1941 he was appointed as the captain of the destroyer , stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. = December 7, 1941 = Early in the morning of December 7, 1941, the Ward, while on patrol near the entrance to Pearl Harbor, was alerted by the cargo ship to the presence of a Japanese midget submarine attempting to infiltrate into the harbor entrance. The Ward opened fire with her number three deck gun, then dropped depth charges, and sank the submarine. Outerbridge's radio reports were discounted by senior officers at naval headquarters despite his efforts to emphasize that there could be no mistake, sending a second report with more explicit detail: \\"We have attacked, fired upon, and dropped depth charges upon submarine operating in defensive sea area.\\" This happened just 70 minutes before the Japanese naval air forces commenced their attacks on Pearl Harbor. The action by the Ward's crew was thus the first naval action by U.S. forces in World War II, and the gun that fired the first shot was installed as a memorial at the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The midget submarine the Ward sank that morning was finally located in August 2002 in of water just outside Pearl Harbor. For this action Outerbridge was subsequently awarded the Navy Cross. = World War II = From 1942 Outerbridge worked at the Office of the Chief of Naval Transportation in Washington, D.C., before being given command of the destroyer in June 1944. On D-Day the O'Brien stood off the coast of Normandy, and helped protect Allied forces landing on the beaches, by using her guns to attack German defenses near the landing zones. Later the O'Brien performed a similar action off the French port of Cherbourg as Allied ground forces captured the city. Outerbridge and the O'Brien were then reassigned to the Pacific Fleet to participate in the liberation of the Philippines. In a strange twist of fate, on December 7, 1944, during the landings at Leyte Gulf, Outerbridge was ordered to use the O'Brien's deck guns to sink the Ward, which had been severely damaged in a Japanese kamikaze attack. = Post-war = After World War II Outerbridge continued in his naval career, serving as the commander of Destroyer Division 42 in 1945-46, before joining the staff of the Naval War College. In 1949 he returned to sea in command of Destroyer Squadron Four, and served as Chief of Staff and Aide to the Commander of Destroyer Flotilla Four in 1950-51. He was on the staff of the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 1951-52, and served as Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans, Operations and Intelligence, Naval Forces, Far East in 1952-53. Outerbridge commanded the cruiser from 1953 to 1955, then served as Head of the Transportation and Petroleum Branch in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (Logistics, Plans). He retired in 1957, receiving promotion to rear admiral. Outerbridge taught school in the area of science in the late 1960s at an elementary and junior high private school, Gulfstream School, located in the town of Gulf Stream, Florida (near Delray Beach). He also taught biology at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. for one year, 1965-1966. Outerbridge died at his home in Tifton, Georgia on 20 September 1986. Outerbridge was portrayed by Jerry Fogel in the 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora!.  References   External links  * Rear Admiral William W.

This installation is located within the grounds of Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico 14 km (9 miles) east of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Overview The 156th Airlift Wing mission is to provide airlift support for missions of the U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) and airlift for joint military exercises while displaying military capabilities and bolster United States ties with our Latin American neighbors. The 198th Airlift Squadron, a subordinate unit of the 156th Airlift Wing, also located at Muñiz Air National Base provides airlift support. The 156th Airlift Wing is under the Air National Guard/Air Mobility Command. Muñiz Air National Guard Base also commonly known in Spanish as \\"Base Muñiz\\" provides support in local emergencies and mobilization of U.S. military troops from Puerto Rico for deployments worldwide. History Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Muñiz, co-founder of the PRANG. The Puerto Rico Air National Guard consolidated its operations and moved from the Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport in May 1956 to a new facility at the Isla Verde Airport located in Carolina, Puerto Rico now known as Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport just 14 km (9 miles) east of San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 10 April 1958, the 156th Tactical Fighter reorganized into a Fighter Group. On 1 January 1976, the 156th Tactical Fighter Group converted from F-104 Starfighter to A-7D Corsair. The first A-7s arrived in November and the last in March 1976. =Jose Antonio Muñiz= In 1963 the Air National Guard Base was renamed \\"Muñiz Air National Guard Base\\" while commemorating the 20th anniversary of its federal recognition in honor of Puerto Rico Air National Guard Co-founder, Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Muñiz a former United States Air Force officer who during World War II served in the United States Army Air Forces. In 1960, Muñiz was killed when his F-86D flamed out on take-off and crashed. The Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Muñiz Memorial is located at this base. =Attack by Macheteros= On January 12, 1981, 10 LTV A-7 Corsair IIs and a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter were damaged and destroyed. It is believed that this was a terrorist act made by Boricua Popular Army Machetero commandos that infiltrated into the base. The United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations became in charge of the investigation. The loss was calculated at $45 million. The base Security detail increased from 11 to 22 Air Force Security Police personnel and 46 civilian contract guards. =Papal visit and presidential visit= On October 12, 1984, Pope John Paul II made the first papal visit to Puerto Rico and was welcomed to Puerto Rico by governor Carlos Romero Barcelo and U.S. State Secretary George P. Shultz at Muñiz ANGB. Pope John Paul II left Puerto Rico on the evening that same day. On June 14, 2011, United States president Barack Obama made an official visit to Puerto Rico for four hours. He arrived on the 747 Air Force One with Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi at Muñiz Air National Guard Base and he was greeted by Governor Luis Fortuño. Later, after campaigning, President Obama gave a speech from a hangar at Muñiz Air National Guard Base. =Air mobility role= On November 22, 1997. Muñiz ANGB received its first Lockheed C-130s while celebrating the 50th anniversary of its federal recognition. The Air Force announced conversion of the 156th Fighter Wing from F-16A/B aircraft to C-130 aircraft, changing the task from combat to transport. =Operation Coronet Oak= Coronet Oak was the name for the continuing operation in which Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) C-130 aircraft, aircrews and related support personnel deploy from the United States to Muñiz Air National Guard Base, Puerto Rico, to provide theater airlift support for the U.S. Southern Command. The Guard and Reserve support the Coronet Oak mission year round since April 19, 1999 from Muñiz Air National Guard Base when this mission moved from Howard Air Force Base, Panama as result of the U.S. military withdrawal from Panama. Units rotate in and out of Muñiz ANGB every two weeks. Forces assigned to CORONET OAK provide United States Southern Command with logistic and contingency support throughout Central and South America. Today Muñiz's PRANG P-47 on display at Muñiz Air National Guard Base. Since 1997 the mission for Muñiz Air National Guard base and the 156th Fighter Wing is to provide air mobility support for the U.S. Southern Command. This air base also provides mobilization to assist with humanitarian support in natural disasters such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Muñiz ANGB plays a mayor role in the mobilization for the Puerto Rico Air National Guard troops as well Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve soldiers from Puerto Rico for deployments to Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Muñiz Air National Guard Base host the STARBASE Youth Program. STARBASE is a nonresidential educational program for students (grades K-12) that provides them with real-world applications of math and science. Hundreds of students from schools all over Puerto Rico come to Muñiz ANGB to participate in the STARBASE Youth Program. Some Active Guard Reserve personnel from the Puerto Rico Air National Guard work permanent at Muñiz ANGB. In addition some of the facilities at Muñiz ANGB include a Hangar, Maintenance Shops, Command Offices, Family Readiness Center, Lt. Col. Rafael A.

She was one of a considerable number of Romanov pretenders who emerged from various parts of the world following the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family at Yekaterinberg on July 18, 1918. She stands out, however, as one of very few who claimed to have been Grand Duchess Olga, the Tsar's oldest daughter. She was also known as Maria Bottcher.  Purported escape from Russia  By her own account, Marga Boodts survived the execution at Yekaterinberg when a member of the firing squad, whom she identified only as Dimitri K., knocked her unconscious and pretended that she was dead.\\"Woman claims she is daughter of Czar, survivor of execution\\", St, Petersburg Times (Florida), February 12, 1960, p 20a Dimitri K., who had been a Cossack soldier, replaced her missing corpse with that of a young woman who had been caught stealing from the bodies of the other members of the Imperial family. He later accompanied her to Vladivostok. Boodts claimed that upon her arrival to Vladivostok she was received by a German elite commando,Olga Nicolaievna \\"Estoy Viva memorias ineditas de la última Romanov\\" Martinez Roca, Spain, 2012; and from Vladivostok, she reputedly said to have traveled through China and later she was taken by sea to Germany.Summers, Anthony and Tom Mangold. The File on the Tsar, pp 192, 347. Re-emergence and life in Europe Boodts took her surname from Carlo Boodts, a German officer whom she married in Berlin on May 5, 1926 and divorced two years later.\\"Marga Boodts\\"; www.les-derniers-romanov.com. Retrieved January 12, 2010. It was also while living in Germany that she claimed to have traveled to Doorn, the Netherlands, and visited Kaiser Wilhelm II (1859–1941), who recognized her as Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna. He apparently provided her with financial support for the remainder of his lifetime. She recalled that she had also promised the former Kaiser that she would never reveal her Imperial identity, and would \\"keep the secret of my survival throughout my life\\". According to Boodts, the former Kaiser choose the daughter of a friend, Baroness Elisabeth von Schevenbach, to pick her up upon her arrival to Hamburg, and asked her to take care and provide Mrs. Boodts with accommodation. Boodts lived with Frau von Schevenbach for a few years at Potsdam, and later moved to Berlin. She also lived in a state near Stralsund, in eastern Germany. Boodts' claim gained further credence from 1957, when she was recognised by Prince Sigismund of Prussia (1896–1978), who was a first cousin of the actual Grand Duchess Olga. He, in turn, introduced Boodts to Nikolaus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg (1897–1970), a godson of Tsar Nicholas II, who provided her with financial support until his own death in 1970. In 1974, Prince Sigismund remained convinced of Boodts' authenticity. As he told journalists Anthony Summers and Tom Mangold, \\"we spoke about so many familiar matters that an outsider could not have known about, because they were things that had happened between us two\\". They maintained correspondence until 1976 when she died. There are 530 letters kept in a private archive in Italy as evidence of that relation. In 1958 Princess Charlotte Agnes of Saxe- Altenburg also visited Marga Boodts, together with her brother Prince Frederick Ernst of Saxe-Altenburg. Prince Sigismund and Princess Charlotte both provided affidavits that the woman living at Lake Como was indeed Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia. During that period, Boodts is also said to have received financial support from Pope Pius XII.Massie, Robert. The Romanovs: The Final Chapter, p 147. Mother Pascalina Lehnert, governess of Pope Pius XII, declared in 1983 to have witnessed the special meetings between Boodts and the Pope and said that he acknowledged her as the real Grand Duchess Olga of Russia.Giornale Il Tempo, Italy, November 17, 1983. Living in Lake Como, Boodts remained in relative obscurity for many years and thus managed to avoid the sensational press coverage (and the suspicion of surviving Romanov descendants) that had long plagued her rival Imperial pretender, the notorious Anna Anderson, who claimed to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia. In 1955 she signed a contract with Mondadori editorial of Italy to publish her memoirs \\"Io Vivo\\" (I am alive) as a book. In spite of the contract the book was never published in Italy but in Spain in 2011 by Editorial Martinez Roca becoming a sensational editorial success. Close friends of the Grand Duchess blamed The Vatican for interfering with the publication, due to a legal case pending at the Tribunal of First Instance of the Vatican and the alleged Olga Romanov. Again in 1960, when Anna Anderson took her case to the Hamburg Courts, Boodts decided to make her own claims public. In an interview with United Press International, Boodts insisted that she had seen \\"her sister Anastasia\\" executed at Yekaterinberg, and had now come forward in an effort to discredit the \\"impostor\\" in Germany. She further stated that she was considering legal action of her own against Anderson, and was willing to \\"step into the Hamburg Courts to unmask her\\". Boodts, at that time was very aware that her benefactor, Prince Sigismund of Prussia, was also a firm supporter of Anderson's claims. Indeed, some of Anderson's strongest opponents (including Lord Mountbatten) cited Prince Sigismund's support of Boodts to discredit him as a witness in the Anderson case.Lovell, James Blair. Anastasia: The Lost Princess, pp 225-26, 426. For her own part, Anderson herself once admitted, in a taped interview with journalist Alexis Milukoff, that there was a possibility that Boodts may indeed be her \\"sister\\". The two women, however, never met. By contrast, Boodts is alleged to have met up with a far lesser- known Romanov pretender, Suzanna Catharina de Graaff, who claimed to have been the hitherto unknown fifth child of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, born after an alleged \\"hysterical pregnancy\\" in 1903. Mrs de Graaf's son stated that Boodts not only met his mother but acknowledged her claims, because Boodts herself had been old enough to remember the pregnancy in 1903. Both women exchanged correspondence during ten years. When Mrs. de Graaf's son and his wife subsequently visited Boodts themselves, she reportedly \\"welcomed them as nephew and niece-in-law\\". In 1960, Boodts also revealed to the press that she was currently working on her memoirs in collaboration with a close friend, Gräfin Brigitte von Harrach. Their ambitious project was described as \\"a 300-page book containing a number of very important documents allegedly proving, without any shadow of doubt, that she really was the first-born daughter of the Czar\\". This book was published in September 2012 by Martinez Roca Editorial in Spain. It has an extensive introduction by historian and researcher Marie Stravlo, who found the manuscript in Italy in 2010, together with thirty five thousand documents which supposedly prove that the woman known as Marga Boodts was indeed Olga Nikolaevna. The book is available in Spanish. In 1975, journalists Anthony Summers and Tom Mangold visited Boodts at her Lake Como villa as part of research for their book, The File on the Tsar. She reportedly declined to speak about herself, or past events, and that \\"nothing at all emerged from the meeting to support the notion that she was either the Grand Duchess Olga, or even a Romanov\\". Death Marga Boodts died of pneumonia on October 13, in a nursing home at Sala Comacina, Como, Italy, at the purported age of 81 years. It is said that the money for her grave had been set aside by her former benefactor, the Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg, who had himself died six years earlier. According to the prologue written by historian and researcher Marie Stravlo in the book \\"Estoy Viva\\", following directions of Prince Sigismund of Prussia, her gravestone did not bear the name Marga Boodts but, rather, was inscribed (in German) with text that translated as \\"In memory of Olga Nikolaevna, 1895-1976, eldest daughter of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia\\". As there were no direct descendants to pay for its maintenance, the gravestone was destroyed in 1995. In the epilogue of that same book, Marie Stravlo clarifies that Boodts' remains were not placed in a mass grave, as was told in the past. The bones were carefully transferred to another grave, under the supervision and custody of the Italian family that took care of Boodts until she died. Legacy Boodts' claim to be the Grand Duchess Olga, which was taken seriously by some people during her lifetime, was disproved thirty years later, when archaeological investigation and scientific testing confirmed that all seven members of the Russian imperial family had been murdered at Yekaterinberg in 1918. This was disputed by the Russian Orthodox Church, which requested new DNA testing, authenticating the original findings. On August 23, 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years old. Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Anastasia's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found \\"shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber\\". The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes.

It is, along with the Puerto Rico Army National Guard and the Puerto Rico State Guard, an element of the Puerto Rico National Guard. After beginning as four units, the PRANG expanded to 11 units by the 1980s, including the 1956th Tactics Combat Group, the 140th Radar Squadron and others. As commonwealth militia units, the units in the Puerto Rico Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Puerto Rico though the office of the Puerto Rico Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Puerto Rico Air National Guard is headquartered at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and commanded by Brigadier General Wayne A. Zimmet. Overview Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, Puerto Rico Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Puerto Rico ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Puerto Rico Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with their federal reserve obligations, as commonwealth militia units the elements of the Puerto Rico ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. Commonwealth missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. Components The Puerto Rico Air National Guard consists of the following major unit: * 156th Wing : Established 23 November 1947 (as: 198th Fighter Squadron); operates: C-130H Hercules : Stationed at: Muñiz Air National Guard Base, Carolina, Puerto Rico : Gained by: Air Mobility Command Support Unit Functions and Capabilities: * 141st Air Control Squadron. - Punta Borinquen Radar Station - Aguadilla, Puerto Rico (former Ramey AFB) : During exercises, contingencies, or actual war, the 141st Air Control Squadron's Command and Control mission is to provide meteorological support and deploy with, advise, and assist the ground force commander in planning, requesting, coordinating and controlling close air support, tactical air reconnaissance, and tactical airlift.http://mobile.goang.com/Unit/141st+Air+Control+Squadron * 140th Air Defense Squadron. - Fixed Radar Unit, Punta Salinas - Toa Baja, Puerto Rico : The mission of the 140th Air Defense Squadron involves work with a variety of satellites and systems to provide individuals in the field with real-time space situational awareness. History The Puerto Rico Air National Guard came into existence as a result of the efforts led by Colonel Mihiel Gilormini also known as \\"El Gallo de Yauco\\", Colonel Alberto A. Nido and Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Muñiz. On October 26, 1947, several officers were sworn as members of the nascent PRANG. On November 23, 1947, 18 officials and 33 national guardsmen were organized as a unit under Cpt. Nido. The unit was assigned to the Isla Grande Airport and received its first combat aircraft of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt model. The new PRANG was subdivided into four units. The entity was also assigned the 156th Tactical Combat Group, a medical unit. In November 1950, the 198th was activated during the Jayuya Uprising, remaining in action for 11 days, conducting aerial assaults on U.S. citizens in the municipalities of Utuado and Jayuya, as well as conducting reconnaissance and transporting supplies. In 1954 the PRANG received its first T-33 planes and the following year it received F-86 jets. Aboard these jets, several members of the 198th's Flying Buccaneers broke the sound barrier, including Col. Alberto Nido, Com. Mihiel Gilormini, First Lt. Peter Kryzanowski and Second Lt. José Bloise. The squadron also became distinguished since several of its members were bilingual, a novelty during these days. In a subsequent inspection of Ramey, a group of eleven generals led by Gen. George Finch of the 14th Air Force, noted the progress of the 198th in five years. Sgt. Eugenio Betancourt and Sgt. Rafael Altieri were decorated during this visit, receiving medals donated by the Legislature of Puerto Rico for outstanding service during the year. In 1956, it was relocated at the Isla Verde Airport. After serving during the Korean War, José Muñiz was placed in charge of the 198th Combat Squadron, a function that he performed until his death on July 5, 1960. During this year, the PRANG was activated to provide assistance to the government during a series of floods that affected the east coast of Puerto Rico. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, all pilots were placed on alert and waiting for orders while the crisis was solved in the adjacent island. In 1963, the PRANG participated in the search for Mercury Astronaut Scott Carpenter following his first orbital flight, which the 140th Radar Squadron accomplished under Col. Fred Brown. The following year, personnel and supplies were sent to the Dominican Republic in response to the Dominican Civil War. Beginning in 1964, the unit was assigned the tactical combat and surveillance of the Puerto Rico air space. The 198th Tactical Combat Squadron was placed under Commander Jan Johnson, receiving F-86E, F-86D, F-86H and F-104 models in 1967. This same year, its home base was renamed after Lt. Col. José Muñiz and the PRANG also trained personnel for three groups IOC the Venezuelan Air Force. The entity recruited poor children, hosting a camp for that population in 1970. That same year, the 156th was given an award as the most prominent medical unit in all of the USNG system. One of P-47 Thunderbolts was restored for flight in 1972. Towards the year's end, the PRANG was sent with supplies for the victims of the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake. In 1974, the unit was sent to Honduras following the passing of Hurricane Fifi–Orlene. The following year, the PRANG was sent to respond to the 1976 Guatemala earthquake. In 1976, the 198th received an A-7D Corsair. In 1976, the unit's double task was modified. By 1977, the same year that the PRANG celebrated its 30th Anniversary, the 140th Radar Squadron was operating additional detachments at Ramey Air Force Base. Gilormini was promoted to brigadier general and served as commander until his retirement in 1975. Colonel Nido was promoted to Brigadier General and served at National Guard Headquarters as Chief of Staff for Air. Brigadier General Jose M. Portela, the youngest C-141 Starlifter aircraft commander and captain was the only reservist ever to serve as director of mobility forces for Bosnia, served as commander of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard from January 11, 2005 to November 2006.National Guard Bureau biography of Brigadier General Jose M. Portela The tactical aviation element of PRANG operates as the 156th Airlift Wing, 198th Airlift Squadron, flying C-130E aircraft. They operate out of Muñiz Air National Guard Base, located within the grounds of Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport. In the past, they have operated P-47 Thunderbolts, C-47 Skytrains, C-45, T-6 Texan, B-26 Invader, L-5 Sentinel, T-33 Shooting Star, F-86D, F-86E, and F-86H Sabre Jets, F-104 Starfighters, C-54, T-29, C-131, U-3, O-2, A-7D Corsair II, F-16 Fighting Falcons, C-26, and currently, C-130 Hercules type aircraft. Phasing out the F-16s left Puerto Rico with no air-to- air defense assets. In August 2016, the 156th was recognized. Muñiz Air National Guard Base Muñiz's PRANG P-47 on display at the Peterson Air & Space Museum, Colorado Muñiz Air National Guard Base or \\"Base Muñiz\\" in Carolina, Puerto Rico was formally named in 1963 to honor of one of the initial members of the unit who was killed in the line of duty. Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Muñiz (full name: José Antonio Muñiz Vázquez) was lost on July 4, 1960 when his F-86D lost power on climbout for a formation fly-by. Major General Orlando Llenza, then a fellow aviator in the unit, later described the loss in the following translation: > We were short one pilot and Joe offered to stand in. I was formation lead. > Right after departing the runway, his afterburner nozzles failed open, > indicating a loss of power. The ejection seats in use at the time could not > safely extract a pilot at low altitude and Joe went in little after takeoff. > No one in the flight mentioned the event; we executed the flyover and were > notified of the loss upon our return to base. Shortly after that, we > received the F-86H which did not use afterburning and could fly non-stop > from Homestead AFB (in Florida) to San Juan unlike the previous D and E > models, which had to stop for fuel at Guantanamo, Cuba. . Muñiz ANGB is the home of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's 156th Airlift Wing and the 198th Airlift Squadron. 2018 U.S. Air National Guard WC-130H crash 65-0968, the aircraft involved in the crash, photographed in November 2016 On May 2, 2018, a Lockheed WC-130H weather reconnaissance aircraft of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard crashed in the US state of Georgia, shortly after departing from Savannah Air National Guard Base (which is located at Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport). All nine airmen (five crewmen and four passengers) were killed in the accident. =Aircraft= The aircraft was a Lockheed C-130H Hercules more than fifty years old, with tail number 65-0968 and serial number 4110, that had been converted to a WC-130H for weather reconnaissance operations. It was assigned to the United States Air National Guard and operated by the 156th Airlift Wing of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. 1981 Muñiz Air National Guard Base attack On 12 January 1981, the Boricua Popular Army (Ejército Popular Boricua), a Puerto Rican separatist organization, carried out multiple bombings at the Muñiz Air National Guard Base. At the time, it was the largest attack on U.S. military forces since the Vietnam War. The attack was timed to coincide with the birthday of the Puerto Rican independence advocate Eugenio María de Hostos.Anderson, Sean and Stephen Sloan. The Historical Dictionary of Terrorism, Scarecrow Press, 2009 , Pg. 409 The attack caused approximately $45,000,000 in damages to ten A-7D aircraft and a single F-104. It was carried out by eleven commandos of the Popular Army of Puerto Rico, also known as \\"The Macheteros.\\" The base was home to eighteen A-7D and one F-104 aircraft. Eleven saboteurs, disguised in military uniforms, penetrated the security fence and infiltrated the A-7 parking ramp through a hole cut in the perimeter chain link fence. Investigators believe that some, if not all, arrived near the ramp in a boat guided along a nearby channel. The operation occurred during a shift change of the base security, which was provided by both contracted civilian guards and uniformed Air National Guard Security Policemen. The perpetrators exited the area the same way they came in, using the entry point as the exit point. Choosing to strike at shift change indicates the possibility of prior surveillance or insider information. The commandos placed approximately 25 explosive devices on the aircraft. An A-7D Corsair II of the 198th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 156th Tactical Fighter Group in flight prior to the 12 January 1981 attack. This was one of the destroyed aircraft. The planes were destroyed using individual satchels containing four sticks of Iremite (an emulsion explosive) with detonators and incendiary charges. They were time-delayed using a simple watch and battery combination. The explosives were stolen from a Puerto Rican explosives factory, with the theft traced back to the Boricua Popular Army. The AFOSI (United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations) called the explosives \\"sophisticated\\". It was estimated that the entire operation took less than eight minutes to complete. Officials expressed concern as to how a group of semiskilled intruders were able to inflict severe damage to mission capability. Press coverage was substantial at the time of the incident, but died down quickly. This was the first peacetime incident in which USAF aircraft were destroyed by a domestic act, and the first time separatists had attacked a USAF installation on US soil. It was the greatest material loss from any single attack perpetrated against the USAF anywhere in the world. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) was aware of the shortfalls in security at Muñiz ANG Base, and of the threat, yet corrective actions had not been implemented at the time. The bombings resulted in the implementation of more strict security protocols and systems around the perimeter of the base. It was also determined that an increase in security personnel was in order raising the number to 22 guards, up from 11, funded entirely by the federal government, as well as electric devices added to the fence. Destroyed aircraft were A-7D AF Serial Numbers 72-0189; 72-0219; 72-0221; 72-0222; 73-0994; 73-1050; 74-1748, and 74-1755. The sole F-104C, of a Mission Design Series previously flown by the PRANG, was a non-flyable aircraft destined to be a permanent memorial static display.

It was founded as an independent company in the USA, by brothers Hank and Bucky Kashiwa in 1989. The brothers developed the stainless steel \\"cap\\" ski, and founded the company with the belief that stainless steel skis would provide better performance than skis made from other materials. In 2001, Volant production was moved from Wheat Ridge, Colorado to Atomic's Altenmarkt factory in Austria on an OEM basis. In 2003, the Volant brand was acquired by Amer Group, LLC (the parent company of Atomic, and several other brands of sporting equipment). Volant purchased Aggression Snowboards in 1994, in order to acquire a snowboard manufacturing facility. A steel capped snowboard was introduced to the Aggression line (the Aggression Steel) initially. In the following season, Volant introduced its own line of snowboards and shifted the steel capped boards to the Volant line. Volant purchased Limited Snowboards, bringing their president to Wheat Ridge but continuing to produce the Limited line in Canada. Volant was still not profitable due to continuing problems achieving economies of scale with the steel top caps. Costs issues were further heightened with the opening of eastern Europe and globalization of the industry. An average of 4.5 hours of labour spent on each pair of skis could not be justified. Meanwhile, the primary investor's stock portfolio was taking a beating due to the Dot Com bust and he no longer desired to keep pumping money into the haemorrhaging company.

It is located in Morningside Heights on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The youngest students are beginners (2 or 3 years old), and students graduate when they complete eighth grade.  History  St. Hilda’s & St. Hugh’s (SHSH) was founded 1950 by Sister Edith Margaret and the Reverend Mother Ruth (Ruth Elaine Younger). Mother Ruth, a biracial nun from Harlem, obtained her bachelor's degree from St. Hilda's College, University of Toronto. She obtained her master's degree and doctorate in education from Columbia University. Having suffered personally from racial discrimination, Mother Ruth sought to create a school that would be inclusive and welcome diverse groups of students and their families: “I hope that an Episcopalian who attends our school becomes a better Episcopalian, a Jewish child a better Jew, and an agnostic a better agnostic.” In 2016, 50 percent of students come from diverse ethnic backgrounds. In 1992, SHSH’s Board of Trustees made the decision to close SHSH's upper school (grades 9 through 12) at the end of the 1992-93 school year.  Curriculum  Accredited by NYSAIS, St. Hilda's & St. Hugh's follows a classical liberal arts curriculum.

Established in January 2006 following the collapse of the former Novelo's Bus Lines Limited, the reigning monopoly company in Belizean transportation, the NTSL is run by the former owners of that company, David and Antonio Novelo, on much the same permits as the original Novelo's.However this company too has failed like its predecessor. In 2010 to 2011 a massive void was dented into the transport system for Belize when the company went into bankruptcy.  Routes  As of February 2007: # Belize City-Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico * stops in Corozal and Orange Walk * daily from 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM (Corozal and OW to 9:00 pm) # Belize City-Melchor de Mencos, Peten, Guatemala * stops in Belmopan, San Ignacio and Benque Viejo * daily from 5:00 AM to 9:00 PM # Belize City-Punta Gorda Town, Toledo District * stops in Belmopan, Dangriga, Independence Village * daily from 5:00 AM to 9:00 PM # Other routes: Dangriga- Independence-Placencia, etc. Buses are classified as either Regular runs (usual prices) or Express runs (faster, for slightly higher prices).  History  In December 2005, the former Novelo's Bus Line shut down abruptly after more than two and a half decades of transportation service in Belize. Beginning in about 1998, the Novelo brothers, David and Antonio, embarked on an ambitious plan to control all transport services in Belize. They began buying up smaller, competing companies, including Batty's Bus Line, their largest competitor, and Venus Line, owned by Corozal's Froylan Gilharry. Before long, Novelo's controlled the Northern routes to Corozal and the Orange Walk Districts, the Western route to Cayo and most of the southern route to Dangriga and Punta Gorda (the rest was patrolled by P.G.'s James Bus Line), having bought out companies running these routes. The Novelos used monies borrowed from the Development Finance Corporation to pay for these takeovers and operational costs. As often happens with monopolies, hiccups in the industry began to affect the company. Gas prices soared, and it quickly became more expensive to maintain 24-hour-a-day routes. At the same time, monies were due to the Atlantic and Belize Banks, which had bankrolled the expansion plan. By 2005, the situation was too much, and the brothers declared bankruptcy; the once-proud Novelo's Line went into receivership. Even in receivership the company remained unable to lift itself out of trouble, and it went down in December. Meanwhile, the brothers planned to get back into the transport business under a new name: National Transport. This new company would run mainly to the West and North, and in Belize City, under the name Belize In Transit Services. The wary Ministry of Transport at first refused to give the brothers licenses. Attempts to run the routes without licenses were shut down until the process was complete, but for several days Belizeans had no bus transport. NTSL now ran in competition with the Belize Bus Drivers (now Owners) Cooperative, consisting of drivers from the old Novelo's group, which broke ranks with the company following the drivers' dismissal in December. The NTSL and BBOC are two of the \\"big three\\" of Belizean transport, the other being James, the only company the former Novelos did not buy. The thirty- million-dollar loan from the DFC, borrowed by the Novelos, became a main topic of the subsequent hearings into the actions of that company beginning in mid-2006 and continuing. Recent revelations to the investigative commission indicate that the Novelos used their clout to fasttrack the loan in one day, an action that infuriated Belizeans. In February 2007, the Novelos appealed to the Supreme Court to halt the commission, charging conflicts of interest with appointed auditor Mark Hulse (who they said had been part of the receivership cadre) and general ignorance of the Novelo side of the story. This case is currently being argued.

It is situated out of the centre of Cannock. At the 2001 census it had a population of 6,394, and an area of of which 86% is green open space. The population had increased to 7,470 at the 2011 Census. Areas of the village include Little Norton, Little Wyrley, and North Lanes (Lime Lane). The Cannock Chase Coalfield once had 45 collieries within of Norton Canes, employing over 5,800 men, as well as 2 large surface mines; the last pit in the area closed in 1993. Grove Pit was one of these pits, and on 1 October 1930 was the scene of a major tragedy when 14 miners were killed in an explosion there. Another local colliery was owned by the Jerome family, hence Jerome Road now on the site of the pit. This was the family of the author Jerome K. Jerome. Norton Canes borders Chasewater - a collection of man-made lakes formed through old mining pits and a reservoir that feeds the canal system of West Midlands. Chasewater is a popular leisure destination offering facilities for water-skiing and yachting, mountain biking, jogging, walking and bird watching. Norton Canes straddles the UK's first and only Toll Motorway, the M6 Toll which has its northern Toll Plaza and Norton Canes Services is the only services for that motorway. Norton Canes was home to Europe's first drive-through chemist. This is now closed as the chemist has moved into the local health centre located in Brownhills Road.  Schools  There are two primary schools in Norton Canes: Jerome Primary School and Norton Canes Primary Academy. There is one high school: Norton Canes High School. The Jerome Primary School was named to reflect the association with the Jerome family who owned the pit referred to above. Railway Norton Canes never had been served by a railway station with the nearest being Cannock but there were mineral and colliery lines which served Norton Junction which was a major junction for traffic to and from Aldridge, Walsall Wood, Hednesford, Chasewater and Wolverhampton via Cannock. The junction closed to all traffic in the 1980s. The site is now a public park with all the lines being now houses and roads. Only a slight remnant of the former Pelsall - Norton Junction line remains; as a public right of way between the former Ryders Crossing and where the M6 pedestrian overpass is.

She served as regent of Naples during the minority of her stepgrandaughter, Joanna I of Naples, from 1343 until 1344. Life She was the fifth child but second daughter of King James II of Majorca and Esclaramunda of Foix. The exact date of her birth is unknown, although the Chronicle of San Juan de la Peña placed her as the second daughter of the Majorca Royal couple: la primera....Isabel...la otra Sancha,Crónica de San Juan de la Peña, vol. XXXVIII, p. 232. and traditionally she is placed as the penultimate of the six children born from them. In Perpignan on 17 June 1304 Sancha was married by proxy to Robert, Duke of Calabria and Prince of Salerno, the widower heir of the throne of Naples. The wedding in person took place three months later, on 20 September at the Chapelle des Hospitaliers at the Royal Palace of Collioure, Pyrénées-Orientales. The union was childless.ARAGON - CATALONIA in: Foundation for Medieval Genealogy by Charles Crowley [retrieved 1 January 2015]. Sancha became Queen consort of Naples with the death of her father-in- law King Charles II of Naples on 5 May 1309. Two years later (2 August 1311) her husband gave her the Lordships of Potenza, Venosa, Lanciano, Alessa and Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi. The next year, on 24 March 1312, the testament of her mother Queen Esclaramunda (Sclarmunda...regina Majoricæ) secured a bequest to her (...Sanciæ..Reginæ Siciliæ...filiæ nostræ...).Spicilegium Tome III, p. 702. On 22 May 1319 at Marseille, Sancha and her husband prayed before the relics of his brother Saint Louis of Toulouse. At her court in Naples, Sancha welcomed her brother Philip, who was recently joined the Franciscans. He wanted to practice strictly the Rules of Saint Francis of Assisi, and gathered around him a group that became known as \\"the brothers of poor life\\", a branch of Fraticelli or zelanti. This group was therefore a great influence over the King and Queen of Naples and over Delphine of Glandèves, Sancha's confident.Paul Amargier: Dauphine de Puimichel et son entourage au temps de sa vie aptésienne (1345-1360) in, Le peuple des saints. Croyances et dévotions en Provence et Comtat Venaissin des origines à la fin du Moyen Âge, Académie de Vaucluse et CNRS, 1987, p. 155. Philip of Majorca asked his sister and his brother-in-law to intercede with the Avignon Papacy to obtain the privileges necessary for the transformation of the Santa Chiara monastery in a place where would welcome \\"the brothers of poor life\\". However, Pope Benedict XII ended their hopes with three bulls dated on 24 June 1336, 20 February 1337 and 7 August 1340. After the death of Philip of Majorca in 1342, Sancha and her husband remained under the influence of \\"the brothers of poor life\\". Their chaplains, Andrea de Galiano and Pietro de Cadeneto were also followers of Michael of Cesena. The rulers had hosted at Castel Nuovo two spiritual bishops, John Bertholeo, who had just been relieved of his office of Calvi, and William of Scala, who became confessor to the Queen; however, the worst of all was certain Fra Roberto, a personal friend of Angelo Clareto, the leader of the Fraticelli. On numerous occasions, Sancha petitioned the Pope for the dissolution of her marriage, as she desired to become a nun. King Robert died on 20 January 1343, and Sancha became Queen Mother, Regent of the Kingdom and tutrix of her husband's granddaughter and successor, Joanna I. In his will dated four days before, on 16 January, Robert created a Council of Regency who would rule until Joanna's majority, who was fixed at the age of twenty-five. The Council was composed by Sancha, the Vice-Chancellor Philippe de Cabassoles, Bishop of Cavaillon, Fillipo di Sanginetto, Great Seneschal of Provence, and Admiral Giffredo di Marzano.Émile-G.

When Petrarch arrived in Naples in September 1343 as an ambassador of Pope Clement VI, he discovered a Kingdom similar to \\"a ship that was directly to a sinking\\". He particularly put into question the work of Fra Roberto, whose real name was Roberto de Mileto. This little fat man, dressed in rags, still leaning on a cane and wearing a hat or head covering, it seemed like the height of abjection and is described as \\"a horrible animal with three legs\\". Sancha supported her step-granddaughter in the first year of her reign against other factions. However, the ineffectiveness of the Council of Regency forced the Pope, in his capacity as Overlord, to impose his direct rule by sending a Legate, Cardinal Aimery de Châtelus.Émile-G.

In the first anniversary of her husband's death (20 January 1344), and under the influence of her chaplains and confessors, Sancha formally renounced to the Regency and became a nun at the convent of Santa Maria della Croce in Naples, which was known as the place of the buried-alive (sepolte vive). She died there eighteen months later (28 July 1345), aged about 64. Initially was buried at Santa Maria della Croce, but later her remains where translated to Santa Chiara Basilica.

However, there was a border station of the Border Service of Ukraine, a small fishing settlement, some private garden lots, and two vacation resorts, \\"Middle spit\\" and \\"Two Seas\\". The island's electricity was supplied by two diesel power stations. There was also is a pier and a helicopter pad. A second pier, located near the fishing settlement, is in critical condition and is not in use. Two concrete surface roads ran along the island. From May through October, a store was operational at the \\"Two Seas\\" resort. The island was used in construction of the Crimean Bridge, which opened in May 2018, connecting Crimea to mainland Russia. History Tuzla Island was formed when the spit that continued the Taman peninsula suffered from massive erosion during a major storm in 1925. In ancient times (2,500 years ago) the sea level was 4 meters below the present, which meant that at the site of modern Tuzla was quite an extensive area of land, which was part of the Taman Peninsula. Taman Peninsula itself at that time was part of the Kuban delta, and was separated from the rest of the land by river channels, which fell into the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Some historians identify Tuzla as the island of Alopeka, mentioned among the ancient authors, located in the waters of Cimmerian Bosporus, and when the island periodically joined to the Asian shore of the Bosporus, the resulting braid was used as the entrance to the passage through the narrowest part of the Cimmerian Bosporus, which is located between Alopekoy and the European shore of the Bosporus. Other historians and geologists reject such a hypothesis, believing that neither the island nor the Tuzla Spit existed in ancient times. Before the Soviet Union entered World War II in 1941, it was part of the Crimean Oblast which in its turn on February 19, 1954, became a part of the Ukrainian SSR, which after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 became the state of Ukraine. 2003 dispute There was a territorial dispute over the ownership of the island between Ukraine and Russia in October 2003. The Russian authorities claimed the 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine had only included the continental parts of Crimea, even though the Tuzla Island had been administratively part of Crimea since 1941.https://books.google.dk/ The Russian side started to build a dam from the Taman Peninsula towards the island to revive the eroded peninsula without any preliminary consultations with the Ukrainian government authorities. After the construction of the 3.8 km long dam was suspended at the exact point of the Russian-Ukrainian border, the distance between the dam and the island is now . The construction of the dam led to the increase of the intensity of stream in the strait and deterioration of the island. To prevent the deterioration the government of Ukraine funded ground works to deepen the bed of the strait. The reason for those ground works was to stop Russian ships from having to pay a toll to Ukraine for crossing the strait of Kerch, which is considered as territorial waters of Ukraine. Ukraine refused to recognize the strait as inner waters of both countries until 2003. On October 21, 2003 the Border Service of Ukraine arrested the Russian tugboat Truzhenik that crossed the State Border of Ukraine and conducted photo and video surveillance of the island. After the incident, a respective protocol was created and the ship was handed over to the Russian border authorities. On October 23, 2003 the Ukrainian parliament issued a resolution \\"to eliminate a threat to the territorial integrity of Ukraine that appeared as a result of dam construction by the Russian Federation in the strait of Kerch\\". A provisional special parliamentary commission was created to investigate the case more thoroughly. On October 30–31, 2003 talks started between Ukraine and Russia that led to suspension of the construction of the dam. Due to the conflict, on December 2, 2003 a border patrol station of Ukraine was installed on the island. On December 5, 2003 the Cabinet of Ukraine issued Order #735p in regards to urgent measures to save the island. On July 4, 2004 the Cabinet of Ukraine issued Order #429p, which foresaw the construction of shore reinforcement structures and population transfer from the flooding territories. Following the 2003 conflict, the Supreme Council of Crimea ordered the establishment of a new settlement on the island. However, on September 6, 2006, the Kerch city administration refused to create such a settlement, as it conflicted with the administrative- territorial composition of the city. The distance to the unfinished dam that stretches from the Taman peninsula is about , with water depth along the former shallow no more that . Disputes about right of passage were resolved by a 2003 bilateral agreement on cooperation in the use of the sea of Azov and the strait of Kerch, which made these water bodies shared internal waters of both countries, but new tensions arose after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.

Plot Scrooge McDuck foils what Donald Duck calls \\"Magica De Spell's most bizarre and complex scheme yet\\". Donald says neither of them will be satisfied until becoming so rich as Croesus. Scrooge says he's already richer than Croesus once was (actually the doubt about who's the richest man on history remains a doubt around all the story). His three grandnephews tell Scrooge about an exposition at the Duckburg Museum on Croesus. This visit leads our heroes in search of his fabled treasure, as Scrooge himself did 50 years ago. They find the treasure, but due to a rightful ownership by the Turkish locals, all Scrooge keeps is his first coin. Upon learning that a witch named Circe wanted the first coin minted by Croesus for the same reason Magica wants the Number One Dime, Scrooge finds a way to turn this tragedy in a triumph: he gives the coin to Magica. If the spell works, she will no longer try to steal his Number One Dime. Because it doesn't, much to Donald's relief as she tested the amulet on him, Scrooge is now sure he is richer than Croesus once was.

The songs were sung as Riding High was being filmed instead of the customary lip-synching to previous recordings. The film is a remake of an earlier Capra film called Broadway Bill (1934). While the film is generally a light musical comedy, it has an unexpected tragic turn in its story.American Movie Classics Plot Yale graduate Dan Brooks (Bing Crosby) is expected to marry wealthy boss J.L. Higgins' (Charles Bickford) daughter Margaret (Frances Gifford) and join the family box-making business. He is far more interested in racing a horse he owns, Broadway Bill. Doing poorly at work, Dan and his groom Whitey (Clarence Muse) leave town to enter Bill in the Imperial Derby, but first must find money for the entry fee. He and old pal Professor Pettigrew (Raymond Walburn) each try to con the other out of a few bucks, then end up singing the Yale school song to get out of a restaurant tab they cannot pay. Maggie's younger sister Alice (Coleen Gray) is secretly in love with Dan, so she offers him some money, pawning her belongings. Whitey is beaten up trying to win some in a craps game, and Broadway Bill is carted away because Dan does not pay his feed bill. Dan is jailed, too. A rich man makes a bet on 100-to-1 shot Bill, leading to false rumors that the horse is a shoo-in. The odds drop fast, but gamblers and a crooked jockey try to make sure their own favorites win the race. Broadway Bill somehow manages to win, but collapses at the finish line and suffers a fatal heart attack. A saddened Dan takes comfort in deciding to buy and race Broadway Bill II. His enthusiasm persuades Alice and even her dad to lend Dan a hand. Cast *Bing Crosby as Dan Brooks *Coleen Gray as Alice Higgins *Charles Bickford as J.L.

The track burned to the ground in July 1964, just before it was to be demolished. Release and reception To raise funds for a sports stadium, Crosby arranged for the world premiere of the film to be held in Front Royal, Virginia, on April 1, 1950. Crosby’s initial involvement came about on April 30, 1948, after acting as grand marshal of the Grand Feature Parade of the 21st Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival in Winchester, Virginia, and he went on to Front Royal where he sang on the courthouse steps as part of a concert to help raise money for a new stadium. Bing was the first contributor to the Front Royal Recreation Center Building Fund when he donated $1,000. On April 1, 1950, Front Royal celebrated “Bing Crosby Day” and starting at 11 am, Crosby led a two-hour parade through the streets in front of a crowd of 20,000 to Recreation Park for the dedication of the baseball stadium. Park Theater was the venue for the official world premiere of Riding High at 8:30 pm, where Crosby entertained the audience with several songs. During his appearance at the Park Theater, Bing wrote out a personal check for $3,595 to bring the gross receipts of the day to $15,000. The film had its New York premiere at the Paramount on April 10, 1950. The critics liked it, with Bosley Crowther of The New York Times saying; \\"Inspiration is something which strikes rarely in Hollywood—and when it does, it is usually tagged 'genius', out of customary deference to restraint. But whatever you want to call it, it is certainly what hit Frank Capra hard when he thought of recruiting Bing Crosby to play a remake of the oldie, Broadway Bill. And it is surely what stuck with Mr. Capra—and rubbed off on Mr. Crosby, too—all through the redoing of that classic into the current Riding High. For this Capra-Crosby project, which came to the Paramount yesterday, is a genial and jovial entertainment that ties the original...The final word goes to 'Der Bingle', whose lovable way with a horse—as well as with music and people—gives that quality of richness to this film that makes it not only amusing, but deeply ingratiating, too...Even though light and familiar, sentimental, and even absurd, Riding High is his feedbox full of barley. Bing has a stakes winner in Broadway Bill.\\" Varietys review was favorable, too. \\"Big yen by the Hollywood film factories recently for remaking past hits is bound to get another hypo when this one gets around. Frank Capra has taken Mark Hellinger’s yarn, Broadway Bill, which he produced and directed for Columbia in 1934, and turned it into one of the best Bing Crosby starrers that’s come along for a considerable time.\\" The film fan magazine Photoplay was very positive: \\"Just when folk were wondering when Bing Crosby’s lean season was due to end, along comes Frank Capra with a tailor- made story worthy of Bing's considerable talents... Full of high spirits, as fresh as a newly-cut sward, and deliciously humorous, this is without question the best Crosby film for years.\\" Harrison's Reports called the film \\"as good and even better than the original, for the leading role is a 'natural' for Bing Crosby, whose easy-going style and nonchalant glibness give the picture much of its charm.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker also liked it, writing, \\"Besides including interesting stuff about racing, 'Riding High' offers several pleasant songs, rendered genially by Mr. Crosby.\\" Soundtrack *\\"A Sure Thing\\" (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke): sung by Bing Crosby *\\"Someplace on Anywhere Road\\" (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke): sung by Bing Crosby and Clarence Muse *\\"The Whiffenpoof Song\\": sung by Bing Crosby, Raymond Walburn, William Demarest, and group *\\"Sunshine Cake\\" (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke): sung by Bing Crosby, Clarence Muse, and Coleen Gray *\\"The Horse Told Me\\" (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke): sung by Bing Crosby and group *\\"Camptown Races\\": sung by Bing Crosby, Coleen Gray, Clarence Muse, and children Bing Crosby recorded four of the songs for Decca Records.

Besides being Shimada's first novel and a best seller, it was nominated for the prestigious Edogawa Rampo Prize for mystery novels.\\"Nominated for the Edogawa Rampo Prize and a best seller in Japan, this is an intriguing, well-crafted mystery with charts and crime scene maps to ponder over.\\". From \\"The Tokyo Zodiac Murders: Detective Mitarai's Casebook\\". Ron Samul. Library Journal. New York: August 2005, Vol. 130, Iss. 13; pg. 60, 1 pgs Plot The novel is divided into several sections. A foreword from the author challenges the reader to solve the gruesome mysteries; it claims that every clue necessary will be included in the text, and that the characters will have no unfair advantage over the reader. The first section is a fictional short story and will which lays out the setting: it is 1936 in the Shōwa period of pre-World War II Japan. A painter and womanizer named Heikichi Umezawa has long been obsessed with astrology and alchemy; he is a wealthy but fairly old man from a respectable family, who stills lives in a traditionally run sprawling household. He is finishing his greatest work: 12 large paintings, each depicting a member of the zodiac. As he works in his private studio on the last one, a portrait of Aries, his head is smashed with a blunt object. The murder is curious: it took place on a heavily snowing day, and many of the suspects have solid alibis. Further, when discovered, the room is locked and apparently had been locked from inside - leading to a locked room mystery. When the studio is investigated, a bizarre note is discovered - the same short story which starts the novel. In it, the narrator, who identifies himself as Heikichi, describes a long-running battle with mental disease, diabolism, and his murderous urge to create the perfect woman called \\"Azoth.” To do this, he will cut up his 2 daughters, 2 of his 3 stepdaughters and his 2 nieces, and take a single astrologically aligned piece of her body and combine it with the others. The reason given for excluding his remaining stepdaughter, Kazue Kanemoto, is that she is not a virgin. Each one will be killed with an alchemically significant metal and buried in a place which produces those metals. He writes that he will carry out his plan as soon as he finishes the Aries portrait. Shortly after the murder of Heikichi, Kazue Kanemoto is discovered with her head smashed as well. The murder is deemed an unrelated case of aggravated robbery. After that murder, the Heikichi's remaining daughter, stepdaughters and nieces, along with Heikichi's widow, travel to Mt. Yahiko to lay Heikichi's spirit to rest. They split up there, and the 6 young women disappear. Their bodies are discovered over the next few months, buried near mines all over Japan, and missing a body part as listed in Heikichi’s note. The murders become a national sensation, but each one remains unsolved for the next 40 years. The novel is brought up to the present, where a freelance illustrator and avid fan of mysteries, Kazumi Ishioka, is teaching his friend, the astrologer Kiyoshi Mitarai, about the Zodiac Murders; Mitarai had been approached by a client who claimed to have new evidence about the murders. This evidence is revealed to be a secret confession by a policeman involved in the investigation of the murder of Kazue. Just before she was murdered, he had in fact gone with her to her house and had sex with her. Afterwards, an anonymous letter arrived, which claimed to be from one of the many secret agencies in pre-war Japan like the Nakano School. The sender threatens to reveal his tryst with Kazue, which would make him the prime suspect if ever discovered. In exchange for their silence, he would carry out a task for them: take the dead mutilated bodies of six young women to different places in Japan and bury them as specified. In Act 2, Ishioka and Mitarai travel to Kyoto to interview surviving people related to the case. Act 3 sees a more comprehensive investigation of the environs of Kyoto and the people. In the last page, Mitarai is musing about an old scam in which one used tape to counterfeit new paper bills from existing ones. Abruptly, he is struck by insight and he solves all three cases. The author follows with a note to the reader, warning that in the subsequent pages the solution would be revealed, and that the reader has all the needed information, and a valuable hint. =Solution= In Act 4, Mitarai remains coy as to the solution, but takes Ishioka to a polite meeting with the culprit: an old woman who would have been 23 at the time of the murders. Ishioka concludes that that means the culprit behind the murders was in fact one of the daughters, but is unable to deduce which one. The final act sees Mitarai revealing the solution to a number of people. He explains Heikichi’s murder, Kazue's murder, and the Azoth murders: it is possible, if one cuts apart paper money and then tapes the pieces back together appropriately, to create one more bill than one originally had. In the same way, the culprit, Heikichi's daughter from his first marriage, Tokiko (now living under the name of Taeko Sudo), had cut apart the bodies of the other five young women and arranged them in such a way that it seemed as if there were 6 bodies, when in fact there were only 5 - the missing pieces which everyone had assumed would go to building Azoth were in fact all hers. The note too was a forgery intended to mislead and focus attention on Azoth. Taeko was motivated to her elaborate revenge by the extremely poor treatment she received at the hands of her stepmother, stepsisters, and cousins and particularly by the treatment her mother (Heikichi's first wife, Tae) had received: divorced by Heikichi and impoverished, she had to waste her life selling cigarettes on the street. After Mitarai explains everything, the police take credit and news soon arrives that Taeko has committed suicide, after sending a letter to Mitarai detailing her exact role in the story.

It was first published in Germany and Austria in 2004 and soon became a bestseller. Plot The book follows an ensemble of protagonists who are investigating what at first appear to be freak events related to the world's oceans. The book has several sub-plots and will occasionally follow minor unrelated characters to illustrate how events unfold around the globe. Sigur Johanson, a marine biologist working at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, is asked to analyze a new species of marine worms, superficially related to Hesiocaeca methanicola. After several expeditions it becomes clear that the worms, together with bacteria, are destabilizing the methane clathrate in the continental shelf. When the continental slope collapses the subterranean landslide causes a tsunami that hits most of the North Sea's coasts, killing millions and severely damaging the infrastructure in the coastal regions. At the same time Leon Anawak, a marine scientist who investigates the behavior of whales and works for a whale watching company, makes startling observations in the whales' behavior; and is called to investigate an incident where whales and sea-borne mussels seemed to have attacked and incapacitated a commercial freighter. When he returns to his whale watching job, he witnesses how humpback whales and orcas attack the watcher's boats. The whales work together to capsize the boats and then kill the people drifting in the water. These events are part of a worldwide phenomenon. Several other attacks are briefly described in the plot: swimmers are driven from the coast by sharks and venomous jellyfish; commercial ships are attacked and sometimes destroyed; France sees an outbreak of an epidemic caused by lobsters contaminated with a highly lethal type of Pfiesteria. When it becomes clear that all those events are related, an international scientific task force is created under the lead of the United States, led by Lieutenant General Judith Li, a close friend and adviser to the President; the protagonists become part of it. While the task force is in session, the attacks on humanity continue: the North American east coast is overrun by Pfiesteria-infested crabs that attack New York City, Washington D.C., and later Boston, causing millions of deaths and rendering the affected cities uninhabitable. The Gulf Stream has also ceased to exist, an event that may initiate a global climate change that would threaten human civilization. Sigur Johanson finally announces his hypothesis: the phenomena are intentional attacks by an unknown sentient species from the depths of the oceans; he states that this is the only logical conclusion, since the attacks are outside the power of any human agency and cannot be a natural phenomenon. Johanson calls them \\"yrr\\", after three letters he typed randomly on his computer. The goal of the yrr is to eliminate the human race, which is devastating the Earth's oceans. General Li and a small group of scientists take to the sea on the helicopter carrier USS Independence in an attempt to find the yrr and make contact with them. They discover that the yrr are single-cell organisms that operate in groups (swarms), controlled by a single hive-mind that may have existed for hundreds of millions of years. The yrr form a collective intelligence and have inheritable memories that are passed on by manipulating parts of their DNA. Individual yrr recognize each other by using a specific pheromone. The scientists have some success in investigating the yrr and make limited contact. The attacks do not cease, however. Sigur Johanson also finds out that General Li has not been honest with them. One of the scientists has been working on a modified pheromone to eradicate the yrr completely. Johanson disagrees with this approach because the elimination of the yrr may completely destroy the marine ecosystem and thus the human race. Li, however, is unwilling to accept that dominance over the Earth may not be a God-given birthright of mankind, and the United States in particular. She will rather take the risk than allow the US power to wane. While she gives orders to have Johanson killed, the ship is attacked and crippled by the yrr and a final showdown ensues on the sinking Independence. Li races for the ship's DeepFlight midget submarines with two torpedoes containing the modified pheromone. The scientists are trying to stop her and at the same time implement their own plan to save humanity. She is stopped at the last moment by Johanson who gives his own life to detonate the torpedoes and kill Li. Karen Weaver, a scientific journalist, then manages to get hold of the last surviving submarine and dives into the depth of the oceans. There she releases a dead human pumped full of the yrr's natural pheromone, hoping to trigger an \\"emotional\\" response. This works and the yrr cease their attacks on humanity. The epilogue reveals that a year later, mankind is still recovering from the conflict with the swarm. The knowledge that humans are not the only intelligent lifeform on Earth has plunged most religious groups into chaos, while parts of the world still suffer from the epidemic the yrr sent to destroy the threat to their marine homeland. Humanity now faces the difficult task of rebuilding their society and industry without coming into conflict with the ever-watching superpower under the sea again.Schätzing, Frank: The Swarm. (New York) ReganBooks, 2006  Themes and motives  The story touches various topics, including the destruction and poisoning of the marine ecosystems on earth, the importance of the sea for humanity and the coexistence of different species. The book also remarks on the human inability to thoroughly understand \\"alien\\" life; it speculates on the philosophical and religious consequence that the discovery of another sentient species on Earth may have. The novel borrows some ideas from the Gaia Theory. It hits on the notion that mankind's activities have created conditions that begin to affect a delicate equilibrium of biotic and abiotic conditions that have fostered and sustained complex life forms and ecosystems. Publication history  The Swarm was a number-one-bestseller for eight months in Germany and has been translated into 18 languages. It was lauded by many critics and readers for its accurate representation of marine biology, geology, and geophysics. = Use of real life persons = Four characters from the novel actually exist and were written into it by Schätzing as thanks for answering his questions on the scientific background: and Heiko Sahling are geologists at the University of Bremen, while is a marine biologist and professor at the University of Kiel. John Ford is a marine biologist in British Columbia and an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia. The character of Samantha Crowe is strongly based on SETI director Jill Tarter, who was also the main inspiration for Jodie Foster's character Ellie Arroway in Contact. =Claims of plagiarism= Thomas Orthmann, a German marine biologist and journalist, claims that dozens of passages in The Swarm have been lifted word for word from his writings. He is demanding compensation from Schätzing. Schätzing refuses to pay any compensation, but has agreed to acknowledge Dr Orthmann in the next edition of The Swarm. =Film adaptation= Hollywood actress and producer Uma Thurman and the German producers Michael Souvignier, Ica Souvignier and Till Grönemeyer Eco-Disaster Book 'The Swarm' Getting Adapted bought the film rights to The Swarm in May 2006. On May 9, 2007, it was announced that a film based on the novel was in the works. Ted Tally has finished writing the screenplay and Dino De Laurentiis was to be one of the prime financial benefactors of the project. The release date was estimated to be 2015, but as of 2018 the film was still in development.IMDb pageSchatzing's 'Swarm' takes film form - Entertainment News, Film News, Media - Variety =Boardgame adaptation= Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling have designed a board game based on the book, published originally by Kosmos and in English by Z-Man Games.\\"The Swarm\\" boardgame from Z-Man Games Each player represents a nation competing in attempts to communicate with The Swarm, and the winner is determined as the most successful researcher.

The English started well, beating Northern Ireland to match the heavy Welsh victory over Scotland on the same day, which featured a hat trick by John Toshack. Scotland recovered by beating the Irish in their next match while England and Wales played out a goalless draw, leaving three sides theoretically capable of winning the Championship in the final round. Wales could only manage a draw with the Irish and so in the deciding match between England and Scotland, a 1–1 half time score gave the Scots some hope but a strong second half performance from England was rewarded with a deserved 3–1 win. This result gave England the Championship, with Wales in second place. The tournament also saw the introduction of goal difference to separate teams, although it had no effect on the eventual outcome.

The school, established in 2003, is Virginia's only three-year accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy program. ACP's mission is to improve the health outcomes of rural and underserved communities, particularly those in Central Appalachia, through education, service, and scholarship. History In 2003, citing a need to address a higher than normal age adjusted mortality rate (42% higher locally as opposed to the rest of Virginia) and a national pharmacist shortage, local leaders in Buchanan County, Virginia began to explore the possibility of founding a new pharmacy school in the region. Spurred by the existence of the Appalachian School of Law, the Buchanan County Board of Supervisors commissioned County Attorney Frank Kilgore to found the University of Appalachia, College of Pharmacy. The school matriculated its first class of students in August 2005, with Edgar R. Gonzalez as president and founding dean,Gonzalez, Edgar R. \\"School of Pharmacy Newly Opened in Southwest\\". Virginia Capitol Connections Quarterly Magazine. Fall 2005. and graduated its first class in May 2008. In March 2009, in order to facilitate its application for accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), the school changed its name from the University of Appalachia, College of Pharmacy to the Appalachian College of Pharmacy. This change was made because the previous name did not \\"accurately represent the singular stand-alone nature of the College’s operations.\\" ACP, like the Appalachian School of Law, was envisioned to become an economic redevelopment tool for the region. Since the college opened, an apartment complex, multiple multi-family housing units, restaurants, and a Walmart have opened less than fifteen miles from the college. The school has been estimated to have added $20 million per year to the local economy. Academics ACP is one of fewer than twenty colleges of pharmacy in the United States that offers a three-year accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy program (Most Doctor of Pharmacy programs take four years to complete). A minimum of 140 credits and more than 1,700 hours of experiential coursework are required for graduation. The majority of experiential coursework occurs during the third year of study, while didactic coursework is conducted during the first two years. Accreditation ACP received full accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) in January 2010, after becoming eligible after the first class of students graduated in May 2008. The college was awarded full accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in December 2011, rendering students eligible to apply for Title IV federal financial aid. Additionally, ACP is certified by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) to operate in Virginia and confer the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Admissions ACP requires that applicants apply online via PharmCAS (the Pharmacy College Application Service). Each applicant must also complete and submit a supplemental application directly to ACP. Beginning in April 2014, international applicants, not living in the United States, became eligible to apply. Facilities The college's first campus, known as the Slate Creek campus, was located four miles (6 km) east of Grundy, Virginia. This facility opened in 2005 to the inaugural class as their primary facility for study and closed in June 2009 when the college moved all operations and activities to its present location. The college's Garden campus, located in Oakwood, Virginia, opened in the fall of 2006 as the academic facilities for the second class of students enrolled at ACP. Garden Hall, a building constructed in the Georgian architectural style by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1940 and the former site of Garden High School (1940-2000), comprises 25,000 square feet and was fully renovated in 2005 with a new student laboratory, library, offices, boardroom, faculty and student lounge, and student gymnasium. In January 2008, construction of an adjoining building began at the Garden campus to consolidate the college onto one campus. McGlothlin Hall, now the primary academic building, opened in June 2009, adding two student lecture halls, eight breakout rooms, and a faculty laboratory, more than doubling the size of the college campus, with an additional 30,000 square feet. An Office of Research opened in June 2013 in McGlothlin Hall, at which time additional laboratory equipment was purchased to support research involving cancer biomarkers and drug targets. Two nearby buildings of more than 10,000 square feet, former sites of the Hagy Café and United Central Industrial Supply Company, were purchased in September 2013 and are being renovated to expand overnight accommodations and research and medication management services to Central Appalachia. The campus now totals more than eight acres. NAPLEX Pass Rates In 2019, 79.4% of students from Appalachian College of Pharmacy passed the NAPLEX on the first attempt compared to a national rate of 87.9% The Class of 2015 achieved the highest first-attempt pass rate for the North American Pharmacists Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) thus far for Appalachian College of Pharmacy graduates, at 95.89%, higher than the national average (92.64%) for 2015 and the highest of all colleges of pharmacy in Virginia (94.44%). The Class of 2015's first-time pass rate for their professional licensure exam is the second successive year of record-breaking NAPLEX first-time pass rates for ACP and again the highest first-time pass rate for all Doctor of Pharmacy degree programs in the state of Virginia. ACP's Class of 2015 achieved the second-highest NAPLEX® first-time pass rate of all accelerated, three-year Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree programs and in the top-third of all colleges of pharmacy in the United States. The Class of 2014's overall pass rate for the North American Pharmacists Licensure Examination was 95.83%, with 95.65% of students passing in their first attempt. The Class of 2014 also achieved overall and first-attempt pass rates that were higher than the national averages (94.48%, 94.88% respectively) for 2014 and the highest 2014 pass rates of all colleges of pharmacy in Virginia. Post Graduate Year 1 (PGY-1) Pharmacy Residency Program A PGY-1 community-based residency program began in July 2011 and was expanded in July 2012 from one residency position to three. It received full accreditation from the American Society of Health- System Pharmacists (ASHP) in spring 2014. , nine pharmacists have completed residencies. Student life =Community Service= The college implemented the innovative Pharmacists in Community Service (PICS) student program, where each student must volunteer a total of one-hundred and fifty hours of community service during their three years of enrollment (fifty hours each academic year) as a requirement for graduation. Students are required to complete one hundred hours of community service before beginning Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) rotations their third year. With approval from the Experiential Education Director prior to service, students can choose or develop their own volunteer activities and serve at their own pace, granted that one hundred hours have been completed by the end of their second year. Of the total one-hundred fifty hours, one hundred community service hours must be health-related, fifty of which must provide patient care, as part of the college's mission to improve the health-related needs of rural and underserved communities. Among the activities students have contributed to are the Appalachia Service Project, Blessings in a Backpack, March of Dimes' March for Babies, Open Airways project, Relay For Life, Remote Area Medical clinics, and the Susan G. Komen for the Cure. In July 2011, the college opened the Mountain Care Center, a community clinic that provides health screenings, medication therapy management, and a prescription assistance program for community residents who are uninsured and unable to afford their medications. In addition, health and wellness programs such as smoking cessation and nutrition counseling are available. A nurse practitioner, affiliated with the Health Wagon, joined the clinic in 2014 on a part-time basis. =Student organizations= ACP has eleven student organizations: *American Pharmacists Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists (APhA-ASP) *American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) * Apothecary Medicinal Plants Society (AMPS) * Fellowship of Christian Pharmacists (FCP) *Kappa Psi - Epsilon Delta chapter * National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) *Phi Delta Chi - Gamma Gamma chapter *Phi Lambda Sigma - Delta Iota chapter *Rho Chi Society *Student Government Association *Student Leadership Council References External links * ACP Web Site * School Profile and Admissions Information in PharmCAS Appalachian culture in Virginia Education in Buchanan County, Virginia Appalachian Educational institutions established in 2003 Pharmacy schools in Virginia Universities and colleges accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Buildings and structures in Buchanan County, Virginia 2003 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Appalachian College of Pharmacy"},{"id":"9695646","text":"Districts of Lower River Division Kiang Central is one of the six districts of the Lower River Division of the Gambia.

The Central Islip State Hospital (CISH) Powerplant was constructed in 1953 by the Titusville Iron Works Co. and The Interboro Co. It was constructed to meet the rising electrical demands of the expanding psychiatric facility located in Central Islip, New York on Long Island. The Powerplant utilized 3 large turbine generators driven by steam created in 6 water tube boilers heated by coal, then eventually oil. Both fuels were delivered by freight train. The steam that spun the generators was then funneled through a system of pipes housed in underground cement corridors to the various buildings on the psychiatric grounds for district heating. The powerplant was known as Building number 101 and technically referred to as The Powerhouse. It was the last of 3 powerplants constructed on the psychiatric facility grounds and by far, the largest. In the mid-1970s, a World War II Sherman Tank was discovered buried south of the Powerplant.Sherman plow tank As deinstitutionalizing progressed across the United States and commercial powerplants on Long Island emerged, The CISH Powerplant was eventually relegated to the role of an electrical distribution hub for externally supplied electricity to the few remaining psychiatric buildings still in use.

See for example the specification for audio to video timing given in ATSC Document IS-191. Modern television systems use large amounts of video signal processing such as MPEG preprocessing, encoding and decoding, video synchronization and resolution conversion in pixelated displays. This video processing can cause delays in the video signal ranging from a few microseconds to tens of seconds. If the television program is displayed to the viewer with this video delay the audio- video synchronization is wrong, and the video will appear to the viewer after the sound is heard. This effect is commonly referred to as A/V sync or lip sync error and can cause serious problems related to the viewer's enjoyment of the program. Error correction To correct audio video sync problems, the video processing circuitry outputs a DDO (digital delay output) signal, which carries information about the amount of delay the video signal experiences due to the video processing. The DDO may, for example, be provided by equipment which adheres to the SMPTE http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText;=SMPTE%20ST2064 ST2064 Audio to Video Synchronization Standard. The audio synchronizer receives the DDO signal and in response delays the audio by an equivalent amount, thereby maintaining proper audio-video sync. Modern audio synchronizers operate by digitizing and writing the audio signal into a ring memory, which is most commonly a RAM-based memory having independent read and write ability. At the appropriate delay time (as conveyed by the DDO) after an audio sample (or group of samples) are written into the memory, the previously stored audio sample is read from the ring memory. The storage and reading of the audio samples take place continuously in response to the respective memory write and read addresses, which increment by 1 count for every write or read operation. For example, an audio sample would be written at address 1, a different sample read from (previously written) address 5, another sample is written at address 2, yet another read from 6, write at 3, read from 7 and so on. The delay between writing and reading a particular sample is 4 addresses which, when multiplied by the amount of time it takes to change from one address to the next, gives the total audio delay. =Tracking changes= Unfortunately, video delays frequently make quick and large changes, for example, a jump in delay time from 2 seconds to 6 seconds is possible. To maintain proper audio-video sync, the audio delay must track these video delay changes. Changing the audio delay requires changing the difference between the write address and the read address. This change can be accomplished by causing either the write or read address to jump forward or backward, however, this jump causes some audio samples to repeat or be lost resulting in an unwanted and annoying pop, click, gap, distortion and/or noise in the audio signal. Some audio synchronizers operate by making repeated, very small jumps that cause unwanted (but less annoying) distortion and noise in the audio signal, rather than pops, gaps, and clicks. Other audio synchronizers change delay by changing the speed of the reading of audio from the ring memory. If audio samples are read out of the memory more slowly than they are written, the delay increases. If audio samples are read out faster than they are written the delay decreases. Using variable speed reading prevents pops, clicks, gaps, distortion and noise from being introduced into the audio, but does create unwanted and annoying pitch errors. For example, reading faster than writing causes the audio pitch to increase and reading slower than writing causes the pitch to decrease. =Variable speed reading= Audio synchronizers that use variable speed reading are generally preferred in professional applications. The control of audio delay is generally more accurate and more easily accomplished. Pitch errors in lower performance devices are uncompensated and kept to a level generally not perceived by the average viewer, by limiting the amount of change of reading speed. Typically the change limit is in the order of 0.2%. Unfortunately, this limits the rate of delay change and when large video delay changes occur the slow tracking rate of these uncompensated synchronizers can cause the audio-video sync to be off for several seconds or minutes until the audio delay catches up with the video delay. Additionally, listeners with excellent pitch perception may notice and be annoyed by even these small pitch errors. =Pitch correction circuit= In higher performance audio synchronizers, the rate of delay change is allowed to be much faster, generally in the order of 25%, and the resulting pitch error is corrected with a pitch correction circuit. The pitch correction circuitry is frequently a proprietary design, due to the difficulty in performing correction so the errors are imperceptible to critical listeners. These higher performance audio synchronizers allow the audio delay to track even large and quick video delay changes without generating any artifacts that are perceptible to even critical listeners for most audio program material. =Recent developments= Recent development in video processing devices permit those devices to sense when a large video delay change will need to be made beforehand and allow that change information to be communicated to the audio synchronizer. The \\"advanced notice\\" from the video processing device allows the audio synchronizer to anticipate and take advantage of particular audio material (e.g., periods of relative silence or periods without music) to facilitate making corresponding large audio delay changes that do not risk generating noticeable audio artifacts. Further developments permit handshaking between the video processing device and the audio synchronizer to control when the video delay change is made to optimize the timing of the tracking audio delay change thereby further reducing the risk of generating noticeable audio artifacts and at the same time reducing the risk of missynchronization due to rapid video delay changes.

It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the Idaho Falls Chukars Minor League Baseball team. It was built during the Pioneer League 2006-07 offseason. American Legion and local high school games are also played at the field. By 2004, the old stadium that used to sit on the same lot, McDermott Field, was outdated, deteriorating, and viewed as an unsuitable baseball venue. In May of that year, the Chukars approached the City of Idaho Falls about a major renovation; the estimated cost was $3.35 million. After the city agreed to allocate $2 million toward the project, the Chukars started a \\"Step Up To The Plate\\" fundraising campaign to come up with the remaining $1.35 million. Despite a fundraising campaign launched by the city of Idaho Falls, a sharp rise in anticipated construction costs resulted in a budget shortfall of half a million dollars. Idaho Falls multi-level marketing company Melaleuca provided $600,000 to complete the construction and the stadium was renamed Melaleuca Field on June 22, 2007. The old McDermott Field stadium was torn down on October 30, 2006, and the new Melaleuca Field stadium was dedicated on June 22, 2007. The new stadium includes a seating capacity of 3,400, eight luxury boxes, two large concession booths, and a sponsored hot tub on the right field line. Features The grandstand includes 1,200 box seats, 1,459 bench seats with backs, eight custom suites with balcony seating, a large press box, two large concession booths, a souvenir shop and various offices. The playing surface is natural grass (Kentucky bluegrass). The concourse wraps around the playing field with a picnic area on the third base side and a party area with hot tub on the first base side. A separate building next to the field contains two locker rooms and extra storage. Awards In 2007, Melaleuca Field was awarded “Best Ballpark Renovation” in the inaugural Ballpark Digest Awards of Distinction. In 2015, the field was selected by fans as the top rookie-level ballpark in Ballpark Digest’s Best of the Ballparks contest and was named fourth best rookie-level ballpark by the Digest.

Waliso is the administrative center of this Zone. Wonchi Lake Waliso town has seven administrative Kebeles. Dej. Geresu Duki Comprehensive Secondary School, Oromia Institute of Water Technology, Ambo University – Faculty of Social Science (Waliso Campus) and other private institutes and colleges are located in Woliso. In Waliso, there is a natural hot-spring, which makes the town one of the leading tourism heritages in Ethiopia. The town allows a round view of 360 degrees from Meja hill – a volcanic mountain (Tulluu Majaa in Afaan Oromoo), situated in the middle of the town. There is also a natural hot-spring, which makes the town a tourism heritage in Ethiopia. In addition, Wonchi volcano (Wancii in Afaan Oromoo), the highest volcano Ethiopias, is 32 kilometers away from Waliso. This volcano contains a crater lake which became a tourist destination.  History  Waliso is derived from the name of an Oromo clan. Legend has it that Waliso is the son of Liban (Liiban in Afaan Oromoo), who had three children: Ammaya (Ammayya in Afaan Oromoo), the oldest, Waliso (the middle) and Kutaye (the youngest). Liban belongs to Metcha, a bigger Oromo clan. The road that ran from Addis Ababa to Waliso was one of the few roads built by the Ethiopian Empire before the Italian-Abyssinian War; by 1938, the 110 kilometers from Addis Ababa to Waliso had been asphalted, and the 90 kilometers beyond to Abelti gravelled. After the Italian occupation of much of Ethiopia, two rival Ethiopian resistance fighters, the Arbegnoch, operated around Waliso: Geresu Duki; (Afaan Oromoo: Garasuu Dhukii) and Olika Dingel. Geresu Duki (a former member of the Ethiopian Crown Prince's personal guard) was in the end the better-known – and the longer-lived of both – but Olika Dingel, a Welega Oromo, was as legendary.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 27 November 2007) Geresu Dhuki was the offspring of a local Oromo Prince, Akkawaaq Darra Gada. In 1955 a 40 kW hydro-electric power station was built; by 1965 the installed electrical capacity was 32 kVA and the annual production 64,500 kWh. In 1958, Waliso was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. The Multipurpose Community Telecentre was opened in February 2000, with assistance from the British Council. It was the first of its kind in Ethiopia, and the next one was opened in Debre Berhan almost two years later. That same year, construction of a 200-bed hospital was completed, the Wolisso Hospital (officially the St. Luke Catholic Hospital), which was then opened on 27 April 2001. Construction was launched in 1997 by an Italian organization (CUAMM Doctors with Africa), equipment included surgical, X-ray and laboratory equipment, at a cost of 72 million Birr. The second largest flower farm in Ethiopia, owned by the Indian company Surya Blossoms, had its official opening in Woliso on 22 June 2009. Present at the opening was Trade and Industry Minister Girma Biru, Indian Ambassador to Ethiopia, Gurjit Sing, Oromia Regional president Abadula Gemeda, and Chairman of Karuturi Global Limited, the parent corporation of Surya Blossoms, Surya Rao.\\"Second largest flower farm in Ethiopia inaugurated, exporting 17 varieties of flowers\\" Ethiopian News Agency 22 June 2009 (accessed 23 July 2009)  Demographics  The 2009 national census reported a total population for Waliso of 59,685, of whom 18,880 were men and 18,998 were women.

MK-4 is produced via conversion of vitamin K1 in the body, in the testes, pancreas and arterial walls. While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for the transformation of vitamin K1 to MK-4, studies demonstrate the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, occurring in germ-free rats and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats. In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4. Dose Bioavailability studies have shown that small oral doses are not detected in the blood – for example 420 mcg of menatetrenone or less tested over minutes and hours are not detectable, and larger doses in the order of milligrams are required, unlike vitamin K2 MK-7 which is detectable in the blood in mcg doses.

It provided bus services across England's widest geographical area, stretching from Berwick-upon-Tweed on the Scottish border, south to Filey in North Yorkshire. History Preserved Bristol LH in October 2009 United was founded in Lowestoft in 1912, with two routes, one in Suffolk and one over 200 miles away between Bishop Auckland and Durham. During the 1920s, the company expanded into Norfolk and south Lincolnshire, and in Northumberland, County Durham and North Yorkshire. In 1929 control passed to the Tilling Group and the London and North Eastern Railway,Control of East Coast Road Services Commercial Motor 2 July 1929 page 50 and in 1931 the new owners split off the East Anglian operations into a separate company, Eastern Counties Omnibus Company.Companies House extract company no 257815 First Eastern Counties Buses Limited formerly Eastern Counties Omnibus Company LimitedEastern Counties history website. United also started East Midland Motor Services. This came about through the desire to expand. One of their managers, W.T. Underwood, was sent to Clowne (near Chesterfield) to set up a bus company in his own name. The Underwoods company later became East Midland. United was nationalised in 1948, and controlled first by the British Transport Commission, from 1 January 1963 by the Transport Holding Company, and from 1 January 1969 by the National Bus Company. The company ran vehicles from its head office in Darlington and garages across their area, including Durham, Hartlepool, Whitby and Peterlee amongst others. Most of those vehicles were Bristols with Gardner engines and Eastern Coach Works bodies, the LH and VR being common vehicles. Another vehicle commonly used was the Leyland National. United were one of only three operators (and the only English operator) to buy the Bristol REMH coach chassis. These 35 vehicles, which had Plaxton Panorama Elite III 49-seat coach bodywork, were delivered between 1971 and 1975. During the mid-1980s, after deregulation, a huge number of Mercedes-Benz and Dodge S56 minibuses were purchased by United for use on new 'town' services in many areas, some replacing existing United 'big bus' services and others on brand new services which were highly competitive with local authorities existing routes (notably the Darlington and the Hartlepool networks). Most were branded with names such as Roadranger (Darlington), Clipper (Whitby), Hoppa (Hartlepool) and Panther (Peterlee) amongst others. These new minibus routes ran around housing estates to a Hail and Ride system and after some initial controversy, these services proved successful for United, most notably in Darlington where the minibus network was hugely expanded.

It was written in Rio de Janeiro from 1921 to 1926 and is the largest and most challenging work Villa-Lobos wrote for the solo piano. It is in one continuous movement and runs about 19–20 minutes. The piece has been described (with license) as \\"Le Sacre du printemps meets the Brazilian jungle\\" . For the title of this work, as he also did for other compositions, such as Vidapura and Momoprecoce, Villa-Lobos compounded two words together: rude, meaning \\"rude\\", \\"coarse\\", \\"uncultured\\", \\"discourteous\\", and poema, \\"poem\\" . However, the score's dedicatee, Arthur Rubinstein, explained, \\"The 'Rude' of the title did not have the English meaning. In Brazil it meant 'savage'. When I asked him if he considered me a savage pianist, he said excitedly, 'We are both savage! We don't care much for pedantic detail. I compose and you play, off the heart, making the music live, and this is what I hope I expressed in this work'\\" . Rudepoêma was later orchestrated by the composer, and premiered under his baton in Rio de Janeiro on July 15, 1942 . The piece was intended as a tonal portrait of the Polish-American pianist Arthur Rubinstein, who premiered the work at the Salle Gaveau in Paris on 24 October 1927, on the first of a pair of concerts devoted to Villa-Lobos's compositions. The (Portuguese) dedication of the score to Rubinstein reads, \\"My true friend, I do not know if I can have fully assimilated your soul with this Rudepoema [not italicised in the source], but I swear with all my heart that I have the impression in my mind of having recorded your temperament and of having mechanically transcribed it on paper, like an intimate Kodak. Therefore, if I have succeeded, you will be the true author of this work\\" . It is rhapsodic in style and elastic in its structure. It is filled with varied rhythms and dynamic tempo changes which are meant to portray Rubinstein's brilliant and varied personality. The two main themes of the work are presented at the outset, the first one in the bass register in the left hand, the second answering it in the right hand. Fragments of both themes are clearly audible throughout the composition, which reaches its climax only five bars from the end, with the right hand raining four fortissimo blows on three low notes, C, B, and A .

Its binomial name means \\"sucking fish\\" in Greek and \\"one-pointed\\" in Latin. The silver lamprey is a member of the Class Agnatha, sometimes referred to as cyclostomes (round-mouths). Other common names include: Bloodsucker, Blue Lamprey, Hitch-hiker, Lamper, Lamprey Eel. The silver lamprey should not to be confused with the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), which has caused considerable damage to native fish populations in the Great Lakes region. Range/Distribution Forbes and Richarson. The silver lamprey is commonly found along the Great Lakes and in the Mississippi River and Ohio River and their tributaries from Minnesota to Nebraska, Tennessee, and West Virginia. There have also been a small number of isolated encounters around the Hudson Bay and in the Mississippi River in Mississippi. Identification The silver lamprey is an eel-like fish with an attenuate body composed of 49–52 clearly defined segments (i.e. myomeres, between the last gill slit and the anus). Silver lampreys possess a cartilaginous skeleton, and adults generally grow to a length of 12 inches and are silvery or bluish in color when spawning. Prior to spawning adults are often a dull brown or tan color. The dorsal fin is continuous, though it may be notched. The mouth is a jawless, sucking disc, with unicuspid teeth arranged in circular rows and is in the inferior position. When expanded, the mouth is wider than the lamprey's body. The lamprey's gills are arranged in a straight line immediately behind the eye, and a single nostril is located between the eyes. Larvae are a brown to tan all over have no eyes (instead they have eyespots) and are called ammocoetes. They also have seven gill openings and do not have any paired fins, they have only a long continuous fin runs from the dorsal to the ventral side. Ammocoetes also have no teeth and instead have an oral hood which houses skin extensions that help them filter particles out of the water as they draw it into their oral cavity. A detailed view of a Sea lamprey's oral disc. The oral disc of the Silver lamprey has a similar pattern of tooth-like structures. Habitat Adult silver lampreys prefer the clear waters of large streams, rivers, and lakes. Adults migrate to nest in flowing water that has stoney or gravelly bottom material. When they hatch, the larvae move to slowly flowing areas initially with thick organic layers. As they grow in size, they begin to migrate to sandy environments where they will reside until they reach metamorphosis. Diet Adult silver lampreys are parasitic, feeding on the blood of other fishes. Most non-parasitic lamprey feed only as larvae, then die. Silver lampreys use their oral discs to attach to their hosts, then cut through the skin and scales with their teeth. The lamprey will remain attached to the host over a long period of time, but they seldom kill their host (which have coevolved with these lampreys). Adults feed on a variety of fishes, including trout, whitefish, smelt, pike, white sucker, brown bullhead, rock bass, walleye, and the armored lake sturgeon. The silver lamprey's larval young feed on drifting plankton, algae, and detritus. Reproduction and life cycle Adult silver lampreys move upstream to spawn in May and June, when the water temperature reaches 50 °F. Using their mouths to move sand and gravel, they dig a nest in the stream bed. Once the nest is completed, the female attaches herself to a rock and the male attaches to her head, wrapping his tail around hers to bring the genitals close together. Eggs and sperm are released, then the pair separates. Once spawning is completed and the eggs are deposited in the nest, the adults die. Upon hatching, the larvae (called ammocoetes) are blind, toothless, and provided with a fine-mesh tissue sieve. They drift downstream and burrow in the sand, mud, and organic material for 4–7 years. During this time, the ammocoetes feed mostly on detritus and algae. When they are approximately four to five inches long, the ammocoetes metamorphose into parasitic adults and migrate downstream to search for hosts. After one to two years feeding as a parasite, adult silver lampreys move upstream to spawn and die. References * Fishes of the Minnesota region :Gary L. Phillips, William D.

She was the mother of T.S. Eliot, a famous poet, editor and literary critic, spouse of Henry Ware Eliot, who ran the Hydraulic Press Brick Company in St. Louis, Missouri, and daughter-in-law of William Greenleaf Eliot, a leading minister in St. Louis and a founder of Washington University. Early life and education Charlotte Champe Stearns was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the second daughter of nine children from her parents Charlotte Stearns (née Blood) and Thomas Stearns Jr. Her father, Thomas, was a merchant who lived in several cities, before he settled down as a partner in the trading firm of Stearns & Bailey in Boston, Massachusetts. Charlotte attended private school and graduated from the State Normal School of Framingham, Massachusetts in 1862. She was employed as a teacher at a private school in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Her teaching career led her to Pennsylvania and Milwaukee at Antioch College, back to Framingham and then to the St. Louis Normal School in St. Louis, Missouri. Married life Stearns married Henry Ware Eliot (18431919) on October 27, 1868, in Lexington, Massachusetts. They returned to Eliot's home city of Saint Louis where they worked and reared their family. They had five daughters and two sons: Ada (Eliot) Sheffield, born in 1869; Margaret Dawes Eliot, born in 1871; Charlotte (Eliot) Smith, born in 1874; Marian Cushing Eliot, born in 1877; Henry Ware Eliot, Jr., born in 1879; Theodora Sterling Eliot, born in 1885 but died in infancy; and Thomas Stearns Eliot, born in 1888.Find-a-Grave In the 1870s when her husband went bankrupt, Charlotte taught school at the nearby Mary Institute. Charlotte's youngest child, Thomas Stearns Eliot, would become well known as the poet T. S. Eliot.  Life with T.S. Eliot  The cover of Stearns's 1926 dramatic poem, Savonarola T.S. Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1888, while the family resided at 2635 Locust Street. T.S. attended Smith Academy and then furthered his education at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. When T.S. was at Harvard, Charlotte sent him a letter that stated: > \\"I hope in your literary work you will receive early the recognition I > strove for and failed. I should so have loved a college course, but was > obliged to teach before I was nineteen. I graduated with high rank, 'a young > lady of unusual brilliancy as a scholar' my old yellow testimonial says, but > when I was set to teaching young children, my Trigonometry and Astronomy > counted for nought, and I made a dead failure.\\" Career Likely Charlotte Stearns's handwriting, or her niece's, on the flyleaf of Stearns' biography of her father-in-law. Title page of William Greenleaf Eliot: Minister, Educator, Philanthropist, written by Eliot, 1904. Eliot was a teacher for several years before she was a scholar and a writer of poems. Many of her poems appeared in religious periodicals. A collection of her poems, Easter Songs, was published in 1899. Her dramatic poem, Savonarola, was published in 1926 with the help of her son, T.S. Eliot. She was interested in the dramatization of events from medieval and Renaissance history that reflected the struggles of men who died for their faith. After her years as a teacher, she participated in social reforms including providing a house of detention for juveniles. Eliot wrote a biography of her father-in-law, William Greenleaf Eliot, a Unitarian minister and leading citizen of St. Louis titled, William Greenleaf Eliot: Minister, Educator, Philanthropist. It was published in 1904. Death Eliot left St. Louis and moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts after the death of her husband in 1919. She died there in 1929 at eighty-six of a cerebral thrombosis. Her ashes were buried next to her husband's plot in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. After her death, Henry Ware Eliot Jr. placed her poems and literary work in the Eliot collection at Harvard University.

Composed in 1911, it was first performed under the direction of Albert Coates, at the Queen's Hall in London on February 26, 1920. That was a concert of the Royal Philharmonic Society with soloists Maud Willby and Norman Stone, with the newly formed Philharmonic Choir under the direction of its founder Charles Kennedy Scott making its first public appearance.Elkin 1944, 65: Elkin 1946, 148. The piece is symphonic, and uses the chorus mainly as a wordless background. Delius explained that > I have tried to express the joy and rapture felt in the High Mountains and > to depict the lonely melancholy of the highest altitudes of the wide > expanses. The vocal parts typify Man in Nature. Sir Thomas Beecham described this as one of Delius's major works ('on an heroic scale, and the inspiration is on an exalted level throughout'Beecham 1975, 168.) and a transitional work, in which Delius moved away from the human sensibilities described in such works as Sea Drift towards a 'certain austerity of manner', attaining 'a magical sequence of sounds and echoes, both vocal and instrumental, all culminating in a great outburst of tone that seems to flood the entire landscape.'Beecham 1975 (cited above), 168. '...we have hitherto unfamiliar elements of austerity and impersonality, as if the composer had grown tired of interpreting the joys and sorrows of human beings and had turned to the contemplation of nature only.'Beecham 1975 (cited above), 221.

The line was originally designed in Yamaha's California custom-shop by Rich Lasner, working with guitar builder Leo Knapp. Initially intended by Lasner and Knapp as a test project, Yamaha Japan chose to produce the instruments. Many variants of the Pacifica have been produced since the 1990s, including models styled like the Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster, twelve string models, carved-top and set-neck versions.  Models  Pacificas all have one of two basic body shapes: a Stratocaster inspired double cutaway shape, or a Telecaster-like single cutaway. Apart from these similarities, the models vary in materials, hardware, and electronics. As of December 2009, there were currently 5 models in production. The best-selling and most recognisable models are the entry-level PAC012 and PAC112. The 112 has a solid Alder body and has always been available with a clear varnish finish, showing the grain of the wood. At the time of the original launch this guitar was intended to compete with some of Fender's budget models. The entry level PAC012 has one Yamaha humbucker and two single coil pickups, an agathis body and a Strat-style vibrato bridge. The early PAC1412 and PAC1421 models had set necks and carved tops with Floyd Rose locking vibrato bridges. These guitars were ultimately too costly to produce and hence too expensive for Yamaha's market. Other variations include the twelve-string PAC303 12, and the reversed headstock PAC721R. The high-end PAC1511MS has a solid swamp ash body, with a Seymour Duncan humbucker neck pickup, and a Seymour Duncan \\"hot-rails\\" humbucker pickup in the bridge position, and a non-vibrato bridge with strings passing through the body. A more affordable version of the Mike Stern signature model Pacifica is the PAC311MS. Both are Telecaster-style guitars similar in shape, but in the case of the PAC311MS controls are slanted rather than on a chrome plate parallel to the strings and the M stands for Maple (neck) and the S for Singlecut as there also was a PAC311S with a rosewood neck. The 311MS and 311S were released in 1998 and production lasted only a couple of years. The 1511MS, however, remains in production. This illustrates how some Pacificas were lower or higher priced versions of conceptually similar guitars. The 904 model featured a Warmoth produced neck with a compound radius, locking Sperzel machineheads, and a push push tone control (like the 604W and 604V) that split the front dual single coil pickup into a single one. The Body was an ash slab top on an alder back and featured a highly engineered neck joint. At the 2011 Frankfurt Musikmesse Yamaha announced the 611HFM, 510V and 311H models and the reintroduction of the 120H. The 120H is similar to the 112V, but features a hardtail, instead of a tremolo bridge, and a pair of humbucker pickups. Endorsers of the Pacifica guitars include Michael Lee Firkins and Mike Stern. The Mike Stern signature guitar is the PAC1511MS.

Bevan was born in Neath. He played for Aberavon RFC, the British Lions and The Barbarians. He formed a formidable club half back partnership with Clive Shell, and was a player got the most out of players outside of him. During his playing career he rivalled Phil Bennett for the Welsh No 10 position. Bennett originally held the place but the club performances of Bevan put him in the ascendancy during the 1974-5 season. A fly half, capped four times for Wales, he won his first cap against France in Paris in January 1975, following a sound performance playing for The Barbarians in the drawn game (12-12) against the touring All Blacks at Twickenham the previous month. During the Paris test, he was one of five Welsh players making their debut (Trevor Evans, Graham Price, Ray Gravell and Steve Fenwick being the others. Wales won for the first time in Paris for many years by 25–12pts with Bevan producing a remarkable try saving tackle. England were the next opponents for the unchanged Welsh and were hammered 20–4 at Cardiff Arms Park. Next up were Scotland at Murrayfield where Bevan sustained a dislocated shoulder. He was replaced by Bennett and Wales lost the match 12–10. Bevan’s season was over. In the 1975-6 season Bevan won his place back and was selected to face the touring Wallabies in Cardiff. His ability to make space for others resulted in Wales winning the fixture 28-3. J. J. Williams, scoring three tries. Bevan was picked for the first Four Nations international against England, with the young David Richards on the bench, remarkably at the expense of Bennett who was omitted from the squad. In a twist of fate, both Bevan and Richards obtained injuries and Bennett was recalled. Wales beat England and went on to win the Grand Slam. Bevan never played for his country again. Bevan, a schoolteacher at Dyffryn Comprehensive at Port Talbot toured New Zealand with the British Lions on their 1977 tour but did not play in any of the internationals against the All Blacks, although, following a dip in form of the tour captain Phil Bennett, many thought he should have been picked for the final test. Bevan was one of three Aberavon players to make the 1977 tour, Allan Martin lock and Clive Williams prop being the others. After his playing career was cut short by his shoulder injury, he coached Aberavon RFC and then the Wales national side from 1982 to 1985. He was forced to retire on the grounds of ill health. Bevan was also a cricketer, an opening batsmen who captained Neath Cricket Club and represented his country. He died of cancer aged thirty-eight in 1986, survived by his wife Judith, a son and a daughter.

He was born and raised in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. In 2009 he was nominated for the main Edinburgh Comedy Award (formerly the Perrier awards) at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Early life Wrigglesworth was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, the fourth of five siblings; he comes from Totley in south-west Sheffield. He was educated at King Ecgbert School near Totley off the A621 (Baslow Road and Abbeydale Road), and went on to study Electrical Engineering and then Acoustics at Salford University (Salford Acoustics). Career After graduating, he worked in the telecommunications and satellite industry, before caving in to friends' repeated requests to perform stand-up comedy. =Stand- up comedy= Wrigglesworth began performing stand up comedy in 2003, when he won the So You Think You're Funny award. In 2006, he quit his day job and became a full-time comedian on the UK comedy circuit. His debut Edinburgh show in 2008 was titled I'm Struggling To See How That's Helping. But it was in 2009 that his second hour-long show, An Open Return letter to Richard Branson, bought him critical acclaim. The show was based on a true story, beginning with Wrigglesworth narrating a letter to Sir Richard Branson. It goes on to describe a hung-over Wrigglesworth boarding a Virgin train at Manchester, and witnessing a ticket inspector forcing an OAP called Lena Ainscow to purchase a new full-price train ticket. Wrigglesworth then conducted a whipround to help Lena, much to the annoyance of the ticket inspector, who arranged for the police to meet the train at Euston, after stating Wrigglesworth would be charged with begging. Thanks to several other passengers becoming embroiled in the story, a furore ensued and he and Lena were released from police questioning. The show ends with the conclusion of the letter to Richard Branson, the point of which was to ask Branson for help in making train fares fairer. After the Edinburgh run, the show toured around the UK, New Zealand, and the Montreal Comedy Festival, before a half-hour version was aired on BBC Radio 4 in 2010. His third Edinburgh show in 2010—called Tom Wrigglesworth's Nightmare Dream Wedding—then toured the UK, before Wrigglesworth took a two- year hiatus from performing at the festival. In 2013, he returned with a new show called Utterly at Odds with the Universe, which is expected to tour the UK and further afield in 2014. This show tracks the relationship he had with his grandfather, centring on audio cassette interviews made in the mid 80s, when Wrigglesworth was a small child. In 2014, Wrigglesworth performed in Green Bay, Wisconsin after his strong resemblance to Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers caught attention in the media. He eventually got to meet Rodgers at Lambeau Field, in addition to receiving the key to the city, as well as a custom Packers jersey, sporting his name and Rodgers' number 12. =Radio= Wrigglesworth regularly appears as a panellist on shows such as The Unbelievable Truth, It's Not What You Know, and It's Your Round, as well as providing the continuity links for one week every month on The Comedy Club on BBC Radio 4 Extra. In early 2011, he recorded a series of four live performances called Tom Wrigglesworth's Open Letters for BBC Radio 4. Each episode was based on different examples of maddening corporate policies in areas such as utility companies and wheel clampers. Each episode highlighted the sometimes infuriating rationales behind huge organisations, and featured a letter from his grandmother to try to get to the bottom of the comedic issues raised in the programme. A second series of the same format was then aired in May 2012. In 2013, he started recording his latest series for Radio 4, called Tom Wrigglesworth's Hang Ups. The series is based on telephone calls he makes back to his family in Sheffield, interspersed with sections of stand up as the stories unfold. From his parents' telephone number, quoted as the pre-1960s 5-digit number 6xxxx, which would now be the 7-digit number 266-xxxx, they live in Crookes. The series was written by Wrigglesworth and James Kettle with additional material from Miles Jupp. It was recorded live at the BBC Radio Theatre with Judy Parfitt, Kate Anthony, and Paul Copley playing the parts of his Granny, Mum, and Dad respectively. Elizabeth Bennett took over from Parfitt in subsequent series of the show. Series 5 was first broadcast in 2019. He also appears regularly alongside Rhod Gilbert on the Rhod Gilbert Radio show, Saturday mornings on BBC Radio Wales. =Television= Wrigglesworth has twice appeared on Live at the Comedy Store for the Paramount Comedy Channel, as well as Edinburgh Comedy Live. In 2009, he starred in three part BBC 2 TV series Electric Dreams, which took an \\"average\\" British family back to the 1970s, 80s, and then 90s, and charted their experience and reactions to gadgets that were available at the time. In 2012, he co-hosted another three part series for BBC 2, Engineering Giants, which oversaw the dismantling and maintenance of massive machines, namely an oil platform, a passenger ferry, and a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. He has also been a contributor for the programme You Have Been Warned for all five seasons so far, and on Dead or Alive for Discovery TV channel. He currently has appeared in 2 seasons (2012–2014) in 24 episodes as Himself – Engineer on the TV Show Outrageous Acts of Science for Discovery TV channel. He is also appearing in a State Farm commercial for his strong resemblance to Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Personal life Wrigglesworth lives in East London.

The Musical Times, 123 (1669): p. 189. In 1921, Delius told Peter Warlock that he had misplaced most of that score.Robert Anderson, \\"Also- Rans?\\" (1998). The Musical Times, 139 (1860): p. 33. Delius resumed work on this composition after becoming blind, dictating the notes to his amanuensis, Eric Fenby. Sir Henry J. Wood conducted the premiere in London on 17 September 1931. The first recording was made by John Barbirolli with the Hallé Orchestra on 4 February 1950. Fenby himself also recorded the score, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in a recording released in 1981 Delius explained the context of the tone poem to Fenby by saying: > \\"I want you to imagine we are sitting on the cliffs of heather and looking > out over the sea. The sustained chords in the high strings suggest the clear > sky and stillness and calm of the scene...You must remember that figure that > comes in the violins when the music becomes more animated.

Biography  William Weston Young, born 20 April 1776, Lewin's Mead, Bristol, England, into a devout Quaker family, the third son of Edward Young, a Bristolian merchant and Sarah (Sally) Young (née Weston). He was educated at Gildersome Quaker boarding school in Yorkshire, which among other things gave him a rudimentary knowledge of science which he was to apply in his invention of the silica firebrick. After a flustered attempt to emigrate to America in 1794, involving his ship being captured by a fleet of French men-of-war, his ultimate escape from captivity and arduous journey home, Young settled back in Bristol, found employment and married fellow Quaker, Elizabeth Davis, in April 1795. In 1798, Young had acquired the financial backing (with notable help from his uncle Thomas Young, father of the physicist, physician and egyptologist Dr Thomas Young) to lease a farm and water mill from John Llewellyn of Ynysygerwn, at Aberdulais, in the Neath Valley, Glamorganshire, Wales. After a lucrative start to his new venture as a miller, corn-factor and farmer, a large purchase of corn, beans and grist coinciding with the Treaty of Amiens, which crashed the value of his goods, as well as some unfortunate dealings with men of false credit brought Young into trouble with his own creditors, and was made bankrupt in May 1802.  The Cambrian Pottery & Friendship with Lewis Weston Dillwyn  Young's early bankruptcy had lasting impact upon his career, no longer independent – he sought employment and so put his artistic skills to use. On 23 January 1803, Young and his wife moved to new lodgings in Swansea, Glamorganshire, where he had gained employment under fellow Quaker, Lewis Weston Dillwyn, as a \\"draftsman\\" at Dillwyn's Cambrian Pottery, where he remained until August 1806. Dillwyn and Young, both in their mid twenties, struck up a close friendship due to their common interest in natural history. Many of Young's painted wares feature accurately depicted flora and fauna as well as the taxonomic names of the illustrated species. Collections of this pottery can be seen at the V&A; Museum, South Kensington, The National Museum of Wales, Cardiff and at the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea. During this period, Young shared his time between decorating the Cambrian Pottery's best porcelain and assisting with Dillwyn's botanical field work. Between 1802–1814, Dillwyn worked on a groundbreaking study of British algae species, The British Confervae, Young's illustrative plates are to be found from Part III onwards in Dillwyn's publications. In Part IV, Dillwyn credits Young with the discovery of:- > *Conferva dissiliens, (Plate 63), in Crymlyn Bog, Swansea, > *Conferva youngana, (Plate 102), in the limestone rock pools near Dunraven > Castle, Glamorganshire. Young's discoveries and collaboration on the work with Dillwyn earned him Associate Membership of the Linnaean Society.  Wreck-Raising, Surveying & Thomas Mansel Talbot's Tomb  In 1806 Young conceived of an improved \\"grab\\" or \\"forceps\\" mechanism to be used in wreck-raising and set about a wreck- raising business, retrieving sunken vessels in the Bristol Channel. His first commission to raise the freight ship Anne and Teresa, salvaged a cargo of copper, making him enough money to establish himself comfortably in the village of Newton Nottage, Glamorganshire as a wreck-raiser, merchant and farmer. In 1811, the death of established local surveyor John Williams of Newland, near Margam, Glamorgan, enabled Young to add surveyor to his list of occupations, filling the niche that Newland left in the region for the next decade. It was during his work as a surveyor, that Young, an amateur geologist too, discovered the potential of a limestone found at Mumbles, Swansea, Glamorganshire being fashioned as marble. In 1814, Thomas Mansel Talbot (1747–1814) (father of Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot (1803–1890)) died at Penrice, Gower, Glamorganshire and Young was commissioned to design Talbot's tomb using locally-sourced minerals. The tomb is a large and elaborate edifice, deploying Penrice alabaster and Mumbles marble, and took a whole six years of design and modelling before its completion in February 1820 in the nave of Margam Abbey Church, Margam, Glamorganshire.  The Nantgarw Pottery  In early 1814, Young became the major investor in William Billingsley and Samuel Walker's venture; the Nantgarw Pottery, Nantgarw, Glamorganshire. Billingsley and Walker, through their prior ties with Flight, Barr & Barr at Royal Worcester had signed an agreement not to disclose their new porcelain recipe to a third party, but there was no clause preventing them from using that recipe themselves. The pottery was set up, but something of Billingsley & Walker's understanding of the recipe or manufacturing process was amiss, as 90% of the porcelain was ruined in the firing. The resources of the three associates soon ran out, and the group approached the British Government's Committee of Trade and Plantations asking for a grant of £500, referring to the subsidy the French Government had given the famous Sèvres Porcelain Factory. They were not successful, but one member of the committee, a porcelain enthusiast; Sir Joseph Banks, suggested to his friend and ceramicist Lewis Weston Dillwyn of the Cambrian Pottery of Swansea, Glamorganshire, should make an inspection and report on the matter. Dillwyn made the inspection, and saw the extent of the firm's losses, but was so impressed with the quality of the surviving pieces that he offered Billingsley and Walker use of the Cambrian Pottery to improve their recipe and process. An annexe was built for porcelain production at the Cambrian Pottery, where Walker and Billingsley were based from late 1814. During this time, Young was preoccupied with the construction of the Tomb of Thomas Mansel Talbot, at Margam Abbey. Billingsley's porcelain recipe was modified and improved, but was still wasteful enough for Dillwyn to abandon the project in Swansea and in 1817, the pair returned to Nantgarw. Young reinvested in the pottery at Nantgarw, additionally becoming an art teacher at Cowbridge Free School to help raise the funds. Billingsley and Walker continued to fire their porcelain at a loss however until one day in April 1820, while Young was away in Bristol, the pair absconded to Coalport leaving behind them the lease to the pottery and several thousand pieces of undecorated porcelain in various stages of production. Young put the Nantgarw Pottery and its contents up for sale via public auction in October 1820, enabling himself to buy-out his minor partners and become sole proprietor. He invited his friend and former co-working artist from the Cambrian Pottery, Thomas Pardoe, to aid him with the completion and decoration of the salvaged porcelain. Young and Pardoe experimented to perfect a glaze for the biscuit ware, but were unable to ever add to Billingsley's stockpile of porcelain, having no access to his recipe. The final sales of the finished porcelain (sold between 1821 and 1822), paid Pardoe and his staff's salaries in arrears, but failed to recoup Young's total losses, leaving Young narrowly avoiding a further bankruptcy. The rare surviving pieces of Nantgarw porcelain are considered today to be among the most valuable artefacts ever produced in Wales. Collections of this pottery can be seen at The V&A; Museum, South Kensington, London and The National Museum of Wales, Cardiff. In 1833 the Nantgarw estate was sold to William Henry Pardoe, son of Thomas Pardoe.  The Dinas Firebrick  Young's experience of firing ceramics, together with his familiarity with the region as a local surveyor and his amateur interests in geology enabled him to conceive of a heat-proof, blast-furnace brick, using silica found in large deposits at the head of the Neath Valley. The process of \\"vitrifying\\" the walls of a ceramic brick-built furnace had been patented by William Harry, of the Swansea Valley in 1817, but Young's solution was to build the whole furnace from a \\"silica firebrick,\\" made with a 1% addition of lime, to bind the blue-grey \\"clay\\" of the Dinas rock. The idea being that the interior of the blast furnace would vitrify and be vastly more durable and ultimately economical, than a mere veneer of silica within a comparatively fragile ceramic shell. Young made early experiments with the recipe and fired his trial bricks at the Nantgarw Pottery kilns, while he and Pardoe finished the Billingsley porcelain for sale between 1820 and 1821 when he finalised his recipe. In 1822, Young applied to the Marquis of Bute to lease the lands near Craig-y-Dinas, Pontneddfechan, in the upper Neath Valley for a period of twenty-one years. Young had the lease, and the patent (No. 5047) but had no funds left to set up the required brickworks. He sought financial backing from a number of sources, including his extended family once more and on 19 October 1822, the Dinas Fire Brick Co. was established in a partnership involving David Morgan, a Neath Ironmonger, John Player and Joseph Young (William Weston Young's older brother). (W.W. Young was a party but could not be a partner in the final enterprise, owing to his previous bankruptcy in 1802 at Aberdulais watermill.) A brickworks was built at Pontwalby, about a mile down river from Craig-y-Dinas. The lucrative company, which sold bricks to industry across the world, transferred through many hands, but the Young family, held their shares throughout, finally passing via Joseph Young to his son William Weston Young Junior (1798–1866). (William Weston Young had no children). From \\"The Dinas Firebrick Co.\\" to \\"John Player & Co.\\" in 1825, to \\"Riddles, Young & Co.\\" in 1829 and finally, becoming world famous as \\"Young & Allen\\" in 1852, the company brochure later mentions that it had supplied firebricks to Swansea's White Rock Copper Works for forty years.  The Final years  Frontis page, featuring a depiction of Neath Castle. The Dinas Firebrick Works experienced some financial and technical troubles during 1829, and Young laid out further monies to support his nephew William Weston Young Jr.'s stake in the company, but the company traded at limited profits for some time, requiring Young to start painting commercially yet again, this time in watercolours of the Neath Valley, where he'd moved once more, to Fairyland House, near the Ivy Tower on the Mackworth Estate, Tonna, Neath, Glamorganshire. In 1835, Young published an eighty-five-page, illustrated book Guide to the Scenery and Beauties of Glyn Neath, published by John Wright & Co. Bristol and sold by Longman, Rees, Orme, Browne & Co. London MDCCCXXXV. The naive but charming book comprises a prose guide to the Neath Valley and is illustrated with landscapes, scenery and decorative topographical and geological maps. Young's wife; Elizabeth died following an awkward fall in March 1842, prompting Young to publish in 1843; The Christian Experience of Elizabeth Young, as a tribute to her, again published by Young's friend John Wright & Co. Bristol. William Weston Young's profit share from the Dinas Firebrick Works was ultimately a very modest pension, and he died in relative poverty in Lower Mitton, Kidderminster on 5 March 1847.

It is the largest artesian spring in the world and the site of the oldest commercial tourist attraction in Florida. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1971 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Its main features are the glass-bottom boat tours on the river, which have operated there, in various forms, since 1878. Long privately owned and operated, the springs area was formerly the site of a small amusement park, Silver Springs Nature Theme Park. Developed in the late 19th century, the springs became a tourist destination for Northerners. It changed hands several times over the years, with various operators introducing boat rides and building related attractions of varying scientific and entertainment quality. It was first used as a location for a Hollywood film in 1916, and was a frequent location for the series of Tarzan films in the 1930s and into the 1950s. Beginning in 1993, the first thorough scientific studies of the springs were conducted and wildlife rehabilitation was started. That year, the State of Florida bought the underlying land, while private businesses continued to operate the attractions and concessions. Environmental issues such as nitrate runoff, related to development in the region, adversely affected the park's health and tourist revenues declined. On January 23, 2013, the Florida Cabinet announced the state would take over the facility after the end of the 2013 summer season, and that the park operators would pay a $4 million buyout of their lease. In October 2013, the State of Florida took over operations of Silver Springs Nature Theme Park and combined the property with the adjacent Silver River State Park to form Silver Springs State Park.  History  = 1800s = The springs were the first tourist attraction in Florida. In the 1860s, Samuel O. Howse bought the 242 acres surrounding the headwaters of the Silver River. Several years after the American Civil War, the springs began to attract tourists from the North via steamboats up the Silver River. Silver Springs gained national attention through journals and guidebooks, and became a mandatory stop on the \\"grand tour\\" of Florida. In the late 1870s, Hullam Jones and Phillip Morell developed the glass-bottom boat and the glass-bottom rowboat, respectively; these were used to take visitors on the river to give them a unique view of the springs. The first railroad to reach Silver Springs, the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad, went into operation by the end of 1879 and transported people and goods from the river landing at the headspring area to the nearby town of Ocala. In 1880, former president Ulysses S. Grant visited the area. In the 1890s, commercial-sized glass-bottom boats were developed. H.L. Anderson purchased Silver Springs and the surrounding area from Howse in 1898. = 1900-1961 = C. Carmichael bought 80 acres of land from Anderson in 1909 for less than $3,000. He soon refitted the tour boats with cushioned seats and canopies to enhance their comfort. The Seven Swans was filmed on location at Silver Springs in 1916; it was the first known use of the Springs as a setting for cinematography. President Calvin Coolidge visited the Springs in the 1920s. Ocalans W. Carl Ray and W. M. \\"Shorty\\" Davidson became partners and leased the land around the Springs in 1924. They incorporated improvements for the tour boats, adding gasoline engines in 1925. Ross Allen, a noted herpetologist, opened the \\"Ross Allen Reptile Institute\\" on some of the land near the head of the Springs. It attracted thousands of tourists to the site for many decades. In 1932 the glass-bottom boats were equipped with electric motors. The 'Princess Donna' built in 1934 still exists and is the only remaining operational boat from this era. The 'Princess Donna' currently tours on Jug Creek in Bokeelia, FL. It's also the oldest commercial tour boat in the state. In the 1930s Colonel Tooey, a concessionaire who operated the \\"Jungle Cruise\\" boat ride, established the first troop of wild rhesus monkeys on an island in the Silver River. He planned to use the attraction of the colony as one of the sights on his Jungle Cruise, but did not know that the rhesus monkeys were excellent swimmers. They quickly escaped the island, forming their own feral troops along the river. Rhesus monkeys are still seen along the river. The Seven Swans was filmed at Silver Springs in 1916, but it was not until 1932 that the location become popular as a filming hot-spot. It was the location for filming of Tarzan the Ape Man, featuring Johnny Weissmuller. During the 1930s and early 1940s, five more of these original Tarzan movies were filmed at Silver Springs. In 1954 Creature from the Black Lagoon was filmed there. The Silver Springs attraction was restricted to white patrons only until 1969. Carl Ray and W.M. Davidson opened a nearby attraction, Paradise Park, which was \\"for colored people only\\", in 1949. Paradise Park became a popular attraction for Black American tourists, and closed in 1969 after Silver Springs became integrated. By 1950 the number of guests annually at Silver Springs was more than 800,000 people. On June 17, 1955, a fire destroyed many buildings by the entrance of Silver Springs, including ticket offices, the gift shop, the cafe, and a storage building. The buildings were rebuilt, and a new building was added across from the dock, with space for retail stores and restaurants. It survives today. In 1958, episodes of the television series Sea Hunt were filmed at Silver Springs, continuing to the end of the series in 1961. = 1962-1983 = On May 1, 1962, Ray and Davidson were talking to the American Broadcasting Company about selling Silver Springs for $7.5 million, but Ray's son W. C. (Buck) Ray Jr., general manager of the park, denied it. On May 29, representatives announced that Silver Springs was being sold to ABC-Paramount. The sale was completed on October 31, 1962. The sale included the \\"lease of the Springs, all of the buildings and about 3,900 acres of land from the head of the Springs to the Ocklawaha River\\". The sale did not include independent concessions such as the Ross Allen Reptile Institute and Tommy Bartlett's Deer Ranch. ABC wanted to control all the attractions, and in June 1963 gave Bartlett a 30-day notice to move his business or sell it to them. Media attention was drawn, as Bartlett said his lease had been extended to January 29, 1967 before Ray and Davidson sold the park to ABC. The parties had a pre-trial conference planned for April 15, 1965, but settled on April 9, 1965; Bartlett turned over the Deer Ranch and all of its contents to ABC. Allen also eventually made a deal with Silver Springs Inc. and sold his Institute. Their agreement allowed him to stay as director of the Institute, which he did for years until his retirement. In October 1971, the natural Silver Springs were declared a National Natural Landmark, recognized as a national resource. In 1973 Silver Springs started a wildlife rehabilitation program. From 1974 to 1978 ABC expanded development at Silver Springs and the surrounding area. In 1974 they started to renovate a 5-acre island. Cypress Island opened as an attraction in November 1974, with formal opening in the spring. Developments included the Cypress Gift Shop and an open-air beer pavilion. Activities and exhibits on the island included a new facility for the Ross Allen Reptile Institute, with three large wooden amphitheaters for reptile shows, and some animal exhibits. The Jungle Cruise loading dock was moved to the island. ABC developed a sister water park, Wild Waters, giving 450 press representatives a tour of all the Silver Springs facilities on April 28, 1978, before opening the next day to the public. = 1984-1999 = In 1984, ABC sold the land occupied by Silver Springs and Wild Waters to Florida Leisure Attractions. In 1989 Florida Leisure Acquisition Corporation bought the land. It opened a 35-acre \\"Jeep Safari\\" in 1990. Visitors are taken into the forest to see wild animals, such as the rhesus monkeys, or entertainment artifacts, such as the tree house built for use in filming the 1930s Tarzan movies. In 1991 \\"Lost River Voyage\\" opened to the public. The boat dock was located where the TV series Sea Hunt was filmed. The boat tour took guests 1 mile down the Silver River to a small island where zookeepers showcased native animals. The boat then returned to dock with its passengers. In 1993 the first comprehensive scientific study of Silver Springs' main spring was conducted, including geological, paleontological and biological studies of the spring. It is the largest artesian spring in the United States. Later in 1993, Florida Leisure Acquisition Corporation (FLAC) sold the land occupied by the Silver Springs and Wild Waters to the State of Florida, but continued to manage the parks under a long-term lease. In 1994, FLAC opened \\"A Touch of Garlits,\\" a museum of antique cars and race cars. It opened the White Alligator exhibit a year later in 1995. In 1996, Ogden Entertainment of Florida, Inc. acquired the lease for Silver Springs and Wild Waters. It initiated a multimillion-dollar expansion project in 1997, finishing in early 1999. The largest expansion in Silver Springs history, this project developed the attractions of \\"World of Bears\\", \\"Big Gator Lagoon\\", \\"Panther Prowl\\", \\"Kids Ahoy!\\", the Twin Oaks Mansion, and other elements in the park. It moved the Giraffe exhibit. In 1999, Steve Irwin, notable as \\"Crocodile Hunter,\\" visited the park. = 2000-present = On January 14, 2000, the state renamed Cypress Island as Ross Allen Island in honor of the late herpetologist who directed his institute at the park from the 1930s until the 1970s. On January 14, the \\"Florida Natives\\" exhibit was opened to the public. Later in 2000, SmartParks, Inc. acquired the lease to Silver Springs and Wild Waters. In March 2002, SmartParks failed to pay the $1.2 million annual lease payment to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. In July 2002, SmartParks sold Silver Springs/Wild Waters to Palace Entertainment. Palace signed a 20-year management agreement with the state. On March 8, 2004 it closed the \\"Jungle Cruise\\" and sold all the associated animals to the Micanopy Zoological Preserve. The attraction was redesigned to show guests Florida history, and was named the Fort King River Cruise, opening in the summer of 2004. Also in 2004, Palace built \\"The Lighthouse\\" ride and the Fantastic Fountains water show. These three new attractions were opened on July 8, 2004. The springs began to exhibit problems affecting many springs in Florida, associated with modern development: fertilizer runoff and septic outflow contain nitrates, which resulted in the overgrowth of brown algae. Thick algae mats have formed on the water, and alligators use them for sunning, but the algae is destroying the river habitat. Increased development in the surrounding area has drawn more water from the aquifer, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the volume of water from the springs. Since before 2000, flow has dropped from 510 million gallons per day (mgd) to 346 mgd in 2012. The pollution has had other adverse effects: a study concluded that the fish population has decreased 90% compared to 1950s levels. To prevent storm runoff from carrying pollution into the springhead, the parking lot will be moved from the area along the waterway. The last two giraffes at Silver Springs, Kimba and Khama, died on November 7, 2011 and December 19, 2012. They were mates, and were both born at Silver Springs (in 1982 and 1987, respectively). \\"Frank the Tank\\", an Aldabra tortoise who had lived in the park for nearly 40 years, died on April 19, 2012. He was the oldest animal in the park, being approximately over 100 years old. The park's profit margin over ten years fell from 23.5% to a meager 5.3%, and Palace wanted out of their lease before they began losing money. In January 2013, the State of Florida announced it would begin managing the park on October 1 of that year. Palace Entertainment agreed to pay a $4 million buyout to end their lease. The private park closed as of September 21, 2013; it became part of the state park system.  Areas  Although Silver Springs does not have official \\"areas\\", the following are areas of attractions and animal exhibits. =Entrance= The main gift shop is located near the entrance. Three flagpoles mark a fork in the path, and the head of Silver Springs. A 1972 plaque identifies Silver Springs as a National Natural Landmark. To the left are shops and restaurants. To the right is a waiting area and loading dock for tours by glass-bottomed boats. =Ross Allen Island= Ross Allen Island, known as Cypress Point Island, Cypress Point and Cypress Island at various times, is a man-made boardwalk area on a 5 1/2-acre island. It opened in November 1974. In 1975 it mainly contained the revamped Ross Allen Reptile Institute, which included three wooden amphitheaters for animal shows, and multiple exhibits for reptiles such as alligators, turtles and snakes. Also, the Jungle Cruise boat dock was moved to the island soon after it opened, and had six new boats that were electrically powered (rather than by diesel engine), could hold 70 people, and had a speed of 8-knots when fully loaded. When it opened, the island also had a gift shop (Cypress Market), a snack shop and an open-air beer pavilion (Billy Bowlegs Cafe). During the 1997-1998 expansion of Silver Springs, \\"Big Gator Lagoon\\" and \\"Panther Prowl\\" were added to Cypress Island. The area was renamed Ross Allen Island on January 14, 2000, in honor of Allen's long-time contribution to Silver Springs through the Ross Allen Reptile Institute. Also on January 14, the Florida Natives exhibit was opened to the public. Ross Allen Island was closed in March 2013 in preparation for the State of Florida's takeover of the park in October that year. All of the animals have been sold, and most of the structures on the island will be torn down, including the Fort King River Cruise (formerly Jungle Cruise) dock and the show amphitheater, according to the Ocala Star-Banner. In late 2016 Ross Allen Island was reopened to the public. Most of the former buildings were demolished, including Billy Bowlegs' Cafe, the gift shop and all of the animal enclosures. All of the original boardwalks were removed and the area was left to return to its natural state. A new, smaller boardwalk loop was constructed to allow visitors to view the area. The only remaining structures are the former Jungle Cruise dock (converted into a pavilion) and one of the amphitheaters. =Twin Oaks Mansion area= Located between the glass-bottom boat dock and the World of Bears area, attractions here have included the Twin Oaks Mansion, built in 1997-1998 in antebellum style; Kiddie Korral, Giraffe exhibit, and the Silver River Showcase Theater. All have been closed. Twin Oaks Mansion was solely used for the Silver Springs annual Concert Series. Giraffes held in the park were moved to this exhibit during the 1997-98 expansion. The Silver River Showcase Theater is an outdoor \\"theater\\" which hosted the Wings of the Springs show. =World of Bears= The World of Bears area was mainly constructed during the 1997-98 expansion of Silver Springs. In that area were the World of Bears, Wilderness Trail ride, a gift shop, Kids Ahoy! Playland, the carousel, and the former location of the Lost River Voyage boat ride. During the 2013 state takeover of the park, the entire area was shut down. The facilities and exhibit have since been demolished.  Rides and activities  = Former rides and activities = Carousel Located near \\"Kids Ahoy! Playland\\" and \\"Kritter Korral\\", the 40-passenger carousel featured endangered animal figures. Lighthouse Ride Located near the headwaters of the Silver River, the Lighthouse Ride combined the features of a carousel and a gondola ride. Passengers rose up to 80 feet above ground to get a panoramic view of the Silver River and the land around it. It was deconstructed in 2013 before the state took over operations in October. Wilderness Trail Ride The Wilderness Trail Ride, formerly the Jeep Safari, was a Jeep ride where guests were taken through a 35-acre section of forest surrounding the park to see many of the native species of animals and more of Silver Springs history (such as Rhesus Monkeys and Tarzan's house from the original Tarzan movies filmed in the 1930s). = Activities = \\"Wings of the Springs\\" show The \\"Wings of the Springs\\" show was located in the outdoor Silver River Showcase Theater, near the Giraffe exhibit. It showcased many birds from around the world. Some of those birds included Parrots, Ducks, Raptors (Eagles, Hawks, Owls, etc.), and other birds. = Other = Kids Ahoy! playland This playland allowed kids to climb ropes, use slides, crawl through tubes, and more. A small ride had miniature motorboats. = Current rides And activities = Glass-bottom boat tours Silver Springs' world-renowned glass bottom boats take guests on tours of the Silver River, which has its head waters within the park. From the boats guests can observe many of the river's springs and wildlife. Self-guided tours Visitors to Silver Springs can now launch kayaks and canoes at the park. A designated paddle trail has been established on the Fort King Waterway which was once used by the Jungle Cruise. Kayaks are also available for rent through a vendor. The former Jeep Safari route has been opened to the public as a walking trail. It is labeled as the \\"Creek Trail\\" on the park's new maps.  Animal exhibits  These are all of the former animal exhibits at Silver Springs. They were shut down in 2013 to make way for the state's takeover of the park. =Big Gator Lagoon= Big Gator Lagoon is a multiple-acre exhibit that housed over 20 American alligators at its time of closure in 2013. It maintained a swamp look to coincide with the alligators' natural habitat. It was constructed during the 1997-98 expansion of Silver Springs, and was closed with Ross Allen Island in March 2013. =\\"Florida Natives\\" exhibit= The Florida Natives exhibit was opened to the public on January 14, 2000. It featured animals and reptiles native to Florida, including otters, many types of snakes, and other reptiles. The otter exhibit was closed in 2012. The entire exhibit was closed and animals relocated in March 2013. =Giraffe exhibit= The Giraffe exhibit in Silver Springs dates back to the early 1980s, and is likely even older than that. The current exhibit is a large roped area with a barn for the giraffes in the center of it. It isn't actually \\"closed\\", but it is empty since \\"Khama\\", the last Giraffe at Silver Springs, died on December 19, 2012. =Panther Prowl= Panther Prowl, was built during the 1997-98 expansion of Silver Springs. It was accessible from Ross Allen Island; as of March 2013, when it was closed, it housed one Florida Panther and two Western Cougars. =World of Bears= World of Bears was the bear exhibit at Silver Springs. It housed three Kodiak bears and five Black bears when it closed in May 2013. When it was built in 1997, it housed many species of bears, such as Black bears, Kodiak bears, Spectacled bears, and even a Polar bear in the winter. Its last day of operation was on May 23, 2013.  Rides, exhibits and activities  These rides and exhibits are listed in the order they were closed. =Silver Springs Reptile Institute= Founded by Ross Allen in 1929, the Silver Springs Reptile Institute (more commonly known as the Ross Allen Reptile Institute) was a site for research as well as exhibit. Allen developed many snake anti-venoms, including dried anti-venom. He also imported venoms for medical and biochemical purposes. Originally located near the current entrance to the park, the Institute was demolished and moved to the Cypress Island in the 1970s. It was enlarged on 1974 to include three amphitheaters for animal shows. The park operators used the premises until 2013 for less dangerous animal shows and animal exhibits; they exhibited diverse crocodile and similar species. =\\"A Touch of Garlits\\"= Opened in 1994, this museum featured antique cars and race cars. It was a branch of the Don Garlits Museum of Drag Racing, located nearby in Ocala. =Lost River Voyage= Opened in 1991, this boat tour started where the television series Sea Hunt was filmed and continued one mile down the Silver River. It was closed in 2011. \\"Reptiles of the World\\" show Located on Ross Allen Island, this exhibit featured alligators, crocodiles and turtles. It was located in one of the three wooden amphitheaters built in the 1970s for the Silver Springs Reptile Institute. It was closed in March 2013 along with the rest of Ross Allen Island. Non-venomous snake show This show featured non-venomous snakes and gave visitors a chance to interact with and learn about many such species from around the world. Visitors were also taught about the snakes' place in the local environment. Located in one of the three amphitheaters on Ross Allen Island, it closed in March 2013. Fort King River cruise This tour carried visitors up the Fort King Waterway. On that voyage, historical scenes and exhibits from Silver Spring's past are featured, including replicas of a Seminole Indian village, 1830s Fort King Army stockade, and a pioneer \\"Cracker\\" homestead. In the 2000s, park operators started removing non-native animals from attractions and refocused on the regional environment and history. It was closed in March 2013 along with the rest of Ross Allen Island.

It was built by the Great Western Railway (GWR), on their route from London Paddington to Birkenhead via Birmingham Snow Hill. It was the most northerly broad-gauge station on the GWR network. Design The OWWR's engineer, John Fowler, designed the frontage, while the GWR's Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed the layout. The station building is two storeys high and constructed of Staffordshire blue brick in Italianate style, which is an unusual combination but the blue brick was abundant in the area in the 19th century. The design of the station was similar to that of the earlier High Level station. The main building has a large pediment; tall, round-headed, pedimented windows with ashlar brackets on the first floor which the main entrance on the ground floor. Plainer wings extend to either side of the main building which protrude to the front. The interior of the former booking hall continues the Italianate theme, with a high, coved ceiling and full-height cornices. The interior was carefully restored in the early 2000s. History Diagram of railways around central Wolverhampton from 1914. The Low Level station is the yellow station in the centre labelled \\"G.W. Pass.\\" The station opened in 1854, although construction was not completed until late 1855. The station was built jointly by the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OWWR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR). The station was initially called Wolverhampton Joint and was renamed to Wolverhampton Low Level in April 1856, at the same time as the nearby London and North Western Railway station was renamed from Wolverhampton Queen Street to Wolverhampton High Level. The station was converted to standard gauge in 1869, and remained basically the same until 1922, when new booking office was built within the booking hall, and a new telegraph department was added to the stationmaster's office. The platforms were extended and the passenger footbridge was replaced. The overall roof had corroded badly and was replaced with standard GWR platform canopies. In July 1939, an Irish Republican Army bomb exploded at the station, wrecking the parcels office area.Subterranea Britannica: SB-Sites: Wolverhampton Low Level Station Closure Closure of the station was made likely by the West Coast Main Line electrification scheme started in 1959, which included the Stour Valley Line, a rebuilt High Level station, and new connections between the former LMS and GWR systems north of the town. From late 1963 to March 1967 the Low Level saw a considerable increase in traffic, but this was only while the electrification work was in progress, as many services were temporarily diverted away from the High Level. When the Stour Valley Line reopened, the services through Low Level were quickly reduced. The last London to Birkenhead express ran in March 1967, and in 1968 Shrewsbury services switched to the High Level. By 1970, the only services left running from Low Level were local trains to Birmingham Snow Hill via Wednesbury Central. This service ceased when the line closed to passengers in 1972. In 1970, the station was converted to a Parcels Concentration Department. Much of the trackwork was removed, the north signal box was demolished and the platforms were greatly modified. It opened on 6 April 1970 and was very successful, handling up to 8,000 parcels each day. However, British Rail's policy on parcel handling soon changed, and the station was closed on 12 June 1981. Platforms and trackbed, prior to redevelopment, January 2006. A general view of the southern end of Wolverhampton Low Level station in the year 2000. The building was listed as Grade II on 25 March 1986. It remained as the British Rail Divisional Engineer's Department until it was purchased by Wolverhampton Metropolitan Borough Council in May 1986, who immediately renovated and preserved the exterior. Meanwhile, the route of the trackbed between Bushbury and Birmingham Snow Hill was preserved in case of future reopening of the line. Redevelopment During the 1980s and 1990s, there were several proposals for redevelopment of the site, including re-opening the station and converting the station into a transport museum, but none came to fruition. In 1999, the Midland Metro tramway opened, using most of the GWR route between Wolverhampton and Birmingham, but this turns towards the centre of Wolverhampton to run along the A41 Bilston Road before reaching Low Level. Redevelopment of the Low Level station site began in 2006, retaining the main station building (which is a listed building) whilst the remainder of the station, including the former main southbound platform is being demolished to make way for a 'mixed use' retail, hotel and residential development. This redevelopment of the station is now (January 2009) mostly complete. The station building itself was destined to become a casino. This has now fallen through. The restored station was home to an art gallery until July 2010. The station building has been transformed into the Grand Station banqueting hall and wedding venue. Station surrounds Several other structures associated with the station are listed buildings. A tall, blue-brick retaining wall and subway lead beneath the High Level tracks to the station, originally built as a shortcut between the two stations and known as \\"the colonnades\\". The brickwork on the interior is glazed white, and has decorative iron railings mounted to it The wall and subway form a grade II listed building.

His works included well-known lyrics such as Bugeilio'r Gwenith Gwyn (Watching the Wheat), and Mae Robin yn Swil (Robin is Shy). His bardic name is derived conventionally from the place of his birth, but probably refers also to Talhaearn Tad Awen, a noted 6th-century Welsh poet. Although he was accepted into Gorsedd y Beirdd in Bala in 1869, he is known to have failed several times to win the chair at the Eisteddfod. In 1849 at the Aberffraw eisteddfod he rose to his feet to contest the adjudication and defend his defeated awdl. In 1863 at the Swansea eisteddfod he held that the Nonconformist judges were biased against him as an Anglican.

In July 1666, he was part of a delegation sent by governor Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy to the English at New York, but a sudden outbreak of Indian hostilities compelled them to turn back. In 1670–71, however, he was sent to assist Father Jean Pierron at a mission among the Mohawks. This assignment proved particularly challenging due to the influence of the Dutch and English traders at Albany, who supplied the tribe with liquor.

AV synchronization can be an issue in television, videoconferencing, or film. In industry terminology, the lip-sync error is expressed as an amount of time the audio departs from perfect synchronization with the video where a positive time number indicates the audio leads the video and a negative number indicates the audio lags the video. This terminology and standardization of the numeric lip- sync error is utilized in the professional broadcast industry as evidenced by the various professional papers, standards such as ITU-R BT.1359-1, and other references below. Digital or analog audio video streams or video files usually contain some sort of synchronization mechanism, either in the form of interleaved video and audio data or by explicit relative timestamping of data. The processing of data must respect the relative data timing by e.g. stretching between or interpolation of received data. If the processing does not respect the AV-sync error, it will increase whenever data gets lost because of transmission errors or because of missing or mistimed processing. Incorrectly synchronized There are different ways in which the AV-sync can get incorrectly synchronized: *During creation AV-sync errors happen because of **Internal AV-sync error: Different signal processing delays between image and sound in video camera and microphone. The AV-sync delay is normally fixed. **External AV-sync error: If a microphone is placed far away from the sound source, the audio will be out of sync because the speed of sound is much lower than the speed of light. If the sound source is 340 meters from the microphone, then the sound arrives approximately 1 second later than the light. The AV-sync delay increases with distance. *During mixing of video clips normally either the audio or video needs to be delayed so they are synchronized. The AV-sync delay is static but can vary with the individual clip. *Video editing effects. Examples of transmission (broadcasting), reception and playback that can get the AV-sync incorrectly synchronized: *A video camera with built-in microphones or line-in may not delay sound and video paths by the same number of milliseconds. A video camera should have some sort of explicit AV-sync timing put into the video and audio streams. Solid-state video cameras (e.g. charge-coupled device (CCD) and CMOS image sensors) can delay the video signal by one or more frames. *An AV-stream may get corrupted during transmission because of electrical glitches (wired) or wireless interruptions - this may cause it to become out of sync. The AV-sync delay normally increases with time. *There is extensive use of audio and video signal processing circuitry with significant (and often non-constant) delays in television systems. Particular video signal processing circuitry which is widely used and contributes significant video delays include frame synchronizers, digital video effects processors, video noise reduction, format converters and compression systems. *The video monitor processing circuit may delay the video stream. Pixelated displays require video format conversion and deinterlace processing which can add one or more frames of video delay. *A video monitor with built-in speakers or line-out may not delay sound and video paths by the same number of milliseconds. Some video monitors contain internal user-adjustable audio delays to aid in correction of errors. *Some transmission protocols like RTP require an out-of-band method for synchronizing media streams. In RTP's case, each media stream has its own timestamp using an independent clock rate and per-stream randomized starting value. A RTCP Sender Report (SR) is needed for each stream in order to synchronize streams. The necessary RTCP packets might be lost (since RTP/RTCP does not guarantee delivery) or not sent until at least several seconds after the stream has begun. Many software clients do not send RTCP at all or send non-compliant data. Effect of no explicit AV-sync timing When a digital or analog audio-video stream does not have some sort of explicit AV-sync timing these effects will cause the stream to become out of sync: *In film movies these timing errors are most commonly caused by worn films skipping over the movie projector sprockets because the film has torn sprocket holes. *Errors can also be caused by the projectionist misthreading the film in the projector, although this is rare with competent projectionists. *AV-sync is commonly corrected and maintained with an audio synchronizer. Television industry standards organizations have established acceptable amounts of audio and video timing error and suggested practices related to maintaining acceptable timing. *AV-sync errors are becoming a significant problem in the digital television industry because of the use of large amounts of video signal processing in television production, television broadcasting and pixelated television displays such as LCD, DLP and plasma displays. *In the television field, audio-video sync problems are commonly caused when significant amounts of video processing is performed on the video part of the television program. *Typical sources of significant video delays in the television field include video synchronizers and video compression encoders and decoders. Particularly troublesome encoders and decoders are used in MPEG compression systems utilized for broadcasting digital television and storing television programs on consumer and professional recording and playback devices. *A source of significant video delay is found in pixelated television displays (LCD, DLP and plasma) which utilize complex video signal processing to convert the resolution of the incoming video signal to the native resolution of the pixelated display, for example converting standard definition video to be displayed on a high definition display. \\"Lip-flap\\" may exceed 200 ms at times. *In broadcast television, it is not unusual for lip- sync error to vary by over 100 ms (several video frames) from time to time. *The EBU Recommendation R37 “The relative timing of the sound and vision components of a television signal” states that end-to-end audio/video sync should be within +40ms and -60ms (audio before / after video, respectively) and that each stage should be within +5ms and -15ms. Viewer experience of incorrectly synchronized AV-sync The result typically leaves a filmed or televised character moving his or her mouth when there is no spoken dialog to accompany it, hence the term \\"lip flap\\" or \\"lip-sync error\\". The resulting audio-video sync error can be annoying to the viewer and may even cause the viewer to not enjoy the program, decrease the effectiveness of the program or lead to a negative perception of the speaker on the part of the viewer. The potential loss of effectiveness is of particular concern for product commercials and political candidates. Television industry standards organizations, such as the Advanced Television Systems Committee, have become involved in setting standards for audio-video sync errors. Because of these annoyances, AV-sync error is a concern to the television programming industry, including television stations, networks, advertisers and program production companies. Unfortunately, the advent of high-definition flat-panel display technologies (LCD, DLP and plasma), which can delay video more than audio, has moved the problem into the viewer's home and beyond the control of the television programming industry alone. Consumer product companies now offer audio-delay adjustments to compensate for video-delay changes in TVs and A/V receivers, and several companies manufacture dedicated digital audio delays made exclusively for lip-sync error correction. Recommendations For television applications, the Advanced Television Systems Committee recommends that audio should lead video by no more than 15 milliseconds and audio should lag video by no more than 45 milliseconds. However, the ITU performed strictly controlled tests with expert viewers and found that the threshold for detectability is -125ms to +45ms. For film, acceptable lip sync is considered to be no more than 22 milliseconds in either direction. The Consumer Electronics Association has published a set of recommendations for how digital television receivers should implement A/V sync. SMPTE ST2064 SMPTE standard ST2064, published in 2015, provides technology to reduce or eliminate lip-sync errors in digital television. The standard utilizes audio and video fingerprints taken from a television program. The fingerprints can be recovered and used to correct the accumulated lip-sync error. When fingerprints have been generated for a TV program, and the required technology is incorporated, the viewer's display device has the ability to continuously measure and correct lip-sync errors. Timestamps Presentation time stamps (PTS) are embedded in MPEG transport streams to precisely signal when each audio and video segment is to be presented, to avoid AV-sync errors. However, these timestamps are often added after the video undergoes frame synchronization, format conversion and preprocessing, and thus the lip sync errors created by these operations will not be corrected by the addition and use of timestamps. The Real-time Transport Protocol clocks media using origination timestamps on an arbitrary timeline. A real-time clock such as one delivered by the Network Time Protocol and described in the Session Description Protocol associated with the media may be used to synchronize media. A server may then be used to for final synchronization to remove any residual offset.

This is an area of forest and grassland which is becoming increasingly more populous as more and more land is cleared for agriculture. Setting The Cameroonian Highlands forests extend across the Cameroon Highlands, a chain of extinct volcanoes, covering an area of in eastern Nigeria and western Cameroon. The ecoregion lies above 900 meters elevation, and is surrounded at lower elevations by the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests at the southern end of the range, and by Guinean forest-savanna mosaic along the central and northern ends of the range; the Cameroon Highlands form the boundary between the Guinean and Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic ecoregions. The highest mountain in the chain, Mount Cameroon is considered a separate ecoregion, while the highest peak within the region is Mount Oku (). As with similar highland areas in Angola and in East Africa the climate is cooler here than is typical of tropical Africa. The highlands are an important source of water for both Nigeria and Cameroon. Flora The vegetation varies with elevation. Submontane forests extend from to meters elevation. Above elevation are distinct montane forests and patches of montane grassland, bamboo forest, and subalpine grasslands and shrublands. The ecoregion is characterized by the presence of afromontane species, which have an archipelago-like distribution across the highlands of Africa. Typical afromontane species are Nuxia congesta, Podocarpus latifolius, Prunus africana, Rapanea melanophloeos, and Syzygium guineense bamendae. Fauna The ecoregion is home to a number of endemic species, along with several more that are also found in the nearby Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests ecoregion. Seven species of birds are strictly endemic: the Bamenda apalis (Apalis bamendae), Bangwa forest warbler (Bradypterus bangwaensis), white-throated mountain-babbler (Kupeornis gilberti), banded wattle-eye (Platysteira laticincta), Bannerman's weaver (Ploceus bannermani), Mount Kupe bush-shrike (Telophorus kupeensis) and Bannerman's turaco (Tauraco bannermani), which is a cultural icon for the Kom people who live in the area. Fourteen species are endemic to the Cameroon Highlands forests and Mt. Cameroon: Andropadus montanus, Phyllastrephus poliocephalus, Laniarius atroflavus, Malaconotus gladiator, Cossypha isabellae and the subspecies Cisticola chubbi discolor (sometimes considered a separate species C. discolor). Nine more montane endemic species are shared with Mt. Cameroon and Bioko: Psalidoprocne fuliginosa, Andropadus tephrolaemus, Phyllastrephus poensis, Phylloscopus herberti, Urolais epichlora, Poliolais lopezi, Nectarinia oritis, Nectarinia ursulae, and Nesocharis shelleyi. Eleven small mammal species are endemic to the ecoregion: Eisentraut's striped mouse (Hybomys eisentrauti), the Mount Oku hylomyscus (Hylomyscus grandis), Mount Oku rat (Lamottemys okuensis), Mittendorf's striped grass mouse (Lemniscomys mittendorfi), Dieterlen's brush-furred mouse (Lophuromys dieterleni) and Eisentraut's brush-furred rat (L. eisentrauti), Oku mouse shrew (Myosorex okuensis,) Rumpi mouse shrew (M. rumpii), western vlei rat (Otomys occidentalis), Hartwig's soft-furred mouse (Praomys hartwigi), and Bioko forest shrew (Sylvisorex isabellae). The ecoregion is home to several endangered primates, including the Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli), an endemic subspecies of western gorilla, mainland drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus leucophaeus), Preuss's red colobus (Pilocolobus preussi), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and several species of guenon including Preuss's monkey (Cercopithecus preussi). Forty species of amphibians are endemic to the ecoregion: Petropedetes parkeri, Petropedetes perreti, Phrynobatrachus cricogaster, Phrynobatrachus steindachneri, Phrynobatrachus werneri, Phrynobatrachus species, Phrynodon species, Cardioglossa melanogaster, Cardioglossa oreas, Cardioglossa pulchra, Cardioglossa schioetzi, Cardioglossa trifasciata, Cardioglossa venusta, Astylosternus nganhanus, Astylosternus perreti, Astylosternus montanus, Astylosternus rheophilus, Leptodactylodon axillaris, Leptodactylodon bicolor, Leptodactylodon boulengeri, Leptodactylodon erythrogaster, Leptodactylodon mertensi, Leptodactylodon polyacanthus, Leptodactylodon perreti, Afrixalus lacteus, Hyperolius ademetzi, Hyperolius riggenbachi, Leptopelis nordequatorialis, Xenopus amieti, Xenopus species, Bufo villiersi, Werneria bambutensis, Werneria tandyi, Wolterstorffina mirei. The following reptiles are also considered more or less endemic: Atractaspis coalescens, Chamaeleo eisentrauti, Pfeffer's chameleon (C. pfefferi), four-horned chameleon (Trioceros quadricornis), Leptosiaphos ianthinoxantha, and Angel's five-toed skink (L. lepesmei). Threats and conservation The forest is continually being cleared for firewood, timber and to create farmland, and many of the mountains have lost significant amounts of forest cover. There is very little formal environmental protection. Urban areas and settlements In Cameroon the mountains are quite heavily populated and used for farming and grazing; much of this ecoregion lies in the Northwest and Adamawa Regions. Towns include Bamenda, capital of the Northwest and base for visiting the mountains including Oku, the Kilum-Ijim Forest and Lake Nyos. In Nigeria the ecoregion is located mainly on the Mambila Plateau, an area of agricultural and grazing land in Taraba State.

Its location is north of Saskatoon and south of Prince Albert on highway 11, in the rural municipality of Duck Lake. Immediately to the north of Duck Lake is the south block of the Nisbet Provincial Forest. It is also the administrative centre of the Beardy's and Okemasis Cree First Nations band government. Duck Lake was home to one of the last operating Residential Schools in Canada, St. Michael's Indian Residential School (Duck Lake Indian Residential School), which closed in 1996. The disruption in the transmission of Cree language, culture, family systems and policy caused by the St. Michael’s Residential school created immense trauma and suffering through the generations of children and youth today who continue to seek justice by reclaiming their identity, culture, and language while supporting the survivors. History Duck Lake was one of the 5 Southbranch Settlements settled by French speaking Métis from Manitoba in the 1860s and 1870s. A Roman Catholic Mission was established in Duck Lake in 1874 by Father André O.M.I. and by 1888 the village had a school, a post office (called Stobart), a flour mill (gristmill) and a trading post. From 1882 to 1905 Duck Lake was within the District of Saskatchewan of the North-West Territories. In 1885, Duck Lake was the site of the Battle of Duck Lake, a conflict between Métis warriors and the Government of Canada, at the start of the North-West Rebellion. At Duck Lake, the Prince Albert Trail, which ran from Regina to Prince Albert, crossed the Carlton Trail and it marked the halfway point between the Métis headquarters at Batoche and the North-West Mounted Police at Fort Carlton. Historic Carpenter Gothic style All Saints Anglican Church built in 1896 is a municipal heritage site.

Rocca's preferred models were the 1742 Alard Guarneri and the 1716 Messiah Strad. His instruments are appreciated today and are considered better than those made by his son Enrico Rocca. Rocca was born in Barbaresco, a small village in the Langhe hills near Alba in Piemonte, and died in Genoa. His parents were Maria Teresa and Giovanni Battista Rocca. He was educated and served in the military and soon after married Anna Maria Calizzano. At the time, Rocca was a baker. The circumstances are unknown what brought him, in a few years, to take up an apprenticeship in Giovanni Francesco Pressenda's Turin workshop. By 1834, his wife died and he moved to Turin to pursue his craft. It was during this time that he became acquainted with Luigi Tarisio, a violin dealer, who had in his possession the Alard and the Messiah. These then became the models Rocca used for his violins. He remarried. His second wife, Caterina Barone died in 1842. Rocca remarried a third time to Giuseppina Quarelli. They had three children, one of whom is Enrico, born in 1847. In 1850, Rocca's third wife died. Rocca moved to Genoa in pursuit of opportunities after the Guadagnini workshop became the clear favorite in Turin. For years he continued his work in both Turin and Genoa. He married a fourth time and was widowed. He earned a reputation as a drunk and his production became inconsistent in quality. In 1856, Rocca married a fifth time to Filomena DeFranchi. Rocca was found dead one night in January 1865 in a well in the gardens of Pila, Genoa, near the Bisagno river. His work became celebrated and well appreciated a few decades after his death. His production was consistent on the violins, violas, cellos, double basses, and guitars he made. According to a few paper documents and the two copper and silver medals, Rocca won prizes in his craft at a national arts and crafts exhibitions in 1844 and 1846.

The room is used for smaller, more private meals than those served in the State Dining Room. Used in the 1800s as a space for the First Family to have their meals, the Family Dining Room was used less for family meals and more for working lunches and small dinners in the 20th and 21st centuries. (Family dinners are now more often served on the Second Floor in the President's Dining Room.) Creation Architect James Hoban 1792 design for the White House featured a Grand Stair in the western part of the mansion on the State Floor. Not completed when the White House was occupied in 1800, the Grand Stairs were probably finished by architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe in 1803 or shortly thereafter. To the north of this wing was a Public Dining Room and (between the dining room and the entrance hall) a Porter's Lodge and a narrow, winding Private Stair. To the south of the Grand Stair was a smaller room, to be used as a Cabinet Room or President's Library. To the east of this room was a President's Antechamber (later known as the Red Room). An oval-shaped Drawing Room (now the Blue Room) and a Common Dining Room (now the Green Room) served as additional dining and living space. During the presidential administration of Thomas Jefferson, the Common Dining Room rather than the Public Dining Room was used primarily for family meals. At Jefferson's request, Latrobe drafted plans for altering the State Floor. In 1807, he proposed turning the Porter's Lodge into a sitting room, and partitioning the Public Dining Room. The eastern part of the room would contain a toilet and dressing room, while the western two-thirds of the room would become a bedroom. Latrobe envisioned this as private space for the president to use during the day, or as quarters for a high-ranking presidential aide. Latrobe's changes, however, were never implemented. 1817 recreation Following the Burning of Washington and the near-destruction of the White House in 1814, the State Floor was rebuilt. This 1817 recreation saw the old Cabinet Room/Presidential Library turned into the State Dining Room, and the President's Antechamber into a Yellow Parlor. The Public Dining Room now became the Private Dining Room. The room was partitioned to make it smaller, and the western third of the room turned into a pantry. President James Monroe gave State Dinners in the Private Dining Room from 1817 to 1825, and subsequent presidents used it as a formal dining room for the First Family or as a space for official but small official events. An 1829, 18-light chandelier (fueled by whale oil and of unknown make) was moved from the East Room into the State Dining Room in 1834 to provide light. In time, the term \\"Family Dining Room\\" began to replace the name \\"Private Dining Room.\\" In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant rebuilt the Grand Stair. Now, only a single staircase led up the north wall to the landing, while a second stair on the south wall led from the landing to the Second Floor. Because so much new room was created on the landing by this renovation, this area on the State Floor became known as the West Sitting Hall. In 1880, during the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes, First Lady Lucy Webb Hayes purchased a large mahogany table and a sideboard from Henry L. Fry of Cincinnati, Ohio. The table was transformed into a console table two years later. During the first administration of President Chester A. Arthur, the D.C. firm of W. B. Moses & Son manufactured a large table for the dining room, which could be extended with leaves, and a mahogany sideboard. An oak sideboard was supplied by John C. Knipp & Brothers of Baltimore. Eighteen leather-upholstered dining room chairs were ordered in 1882 from Hertz Brothers of New York, and another 12 more in 1883. A few years later, 22 copies of these chairs were manufactured by Daniel G. Hatch & Company of Washington, D.C. But by 1901, these 40 chairs were moved to the State Dining Room. 1902 Roosevelt redesign The Family Dining Room during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt. The White House was extensively renovated in 1902, during which the Stair Hall and its staircase were demolished and the State Dining Room expanded northward. Renovations by architect Charles Follen McKim during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt architecturally transformed the Family Dining Room. Using White House architect James Hoban's groin vaulted ground floor hall ceilings as a model, McKim installed a similar groin vault ceiling. The surface was articulated with a low relief plaster meander (Greek key) and five-pointed star decoration, and an eagle within a laurel wreath on the east wall above the mantel. McKim commissioned the Boston furniture manufacturer A. H. Davenport and Company to build a somewhat overscaled Federal-style sideboard, china cabinet, and dining table. Reproduction Chippendale-style sidechairs replaced the series of Victorian chairs used in the nineteenth century. The style combined both Jacobean and Chippendale styles. McKim also ordered a new mahogany console table based on Anthony Quervelle's 1829 console table (made for the East Room, but since about 1860 having stood in the Family Dining Room), and a new mirror. To light the room, McKim hired Edward F. Caldwell & Co. of New York to design a new chandelier and wall sconces for the room. The chandelier design was copied from 18th-century English and French chandeliers, and cut glass was used for the chandelier and wall sconces. 1952 Truman reconstruction A photograph of the ceiling area taken while the room was being dismantled previous to the Truman reconstruction, shows the simple c. 1818 moulding and several pieces of Victorian era wall paper. Plaster decoration and wood trim was removed from the room with the intention of reinstalling it after the reconstruction. Like much of the salvaged wood and plaster from the house, it was pronounced unusable. McKim's groin vaulted ceiling and plaster decoration was copied, along with the Greek key, stars and large eagle ornament. Most of McKim's Colonial Revival furniture was returned to the room. 1961 Kennedy restoration The Family Dining Room during the administration of John F. Kennedy. During the Kennedy restoration the room was designed largely by Sister Parish who asked preservation architect Robert Raley, a consulting architect to Henry Francis du Pont's Winterthur Museum, to assess the room. Raley considered the room to be very strong and in keeping with the White House's time of construction. He made two proposals which were followed: the removal of moulding that organized the walls into a series of upper and lower panels; and the lowering of the window height by extending a cornice across the north wall of the room. These changes had the dual effect of unifying the room and giving the vaulted ceiling more presence. Parish had the walls painted a soft yellow, and yellow silk curtains, tied back twice with ornamental cords and tassels, installed within the frame of the windows. French interior designer Stéphane Boudin had recommended a similar treatment by her in the Yellow Oval Room. A series of mantels and chandeliers were tried, finally resulting in permanent installation of a late Louis XVI green marble mantelpiece with a carved eagle and festoons in white marble. This mantel was acquired for the Yellow Oval Room but proved too small for the scale of that room. Baseboard trim was painted to match the green marble of the mantel, and Federal period dining and side chairs installed. Several pieces of early 19th-century furniture, made in Maryland, were also added to the room. The Kennedy alterations were both praised and criticized. Patrick Phillips-Schrock, writing in 2013, noted that the room's \\"furniture, fireplace and fixtures serve the space well\\" and praised the lowering of the upper sill of the window to more correctly match the cornice line of the room. But he harshly disapproved of the room's painting scheme (calling it a \\"Yellow Fever Epidemic\\"), and called the insertion of a register in the frame above the room's northeast door \\"in incredibly poor taste\\". In 1981, First Lady Nancy Reagan hired Ted Graber to update the Kennedy design slightly. Yellow silk draperies based on an English Regency pattern were installed to cover the window frames. Reagan also had the chairs reupholstered and the carpet replaced. A silver mirror plateau, made in New York by John W. Forbes about 1820, was placed on the table. 2015 Obama redecoration In February 2015, a newly redecorated Old Family Dining Room was unveiled. The redecoration marked the first time since the Kennedy administration that the room was entirely renovated. The room was repainted a light gray to make it look more airy. The room's new style is Mid-Century American, and features a rug, artwork, table, gilded metal and glass wall light sconces, and tea service typical of mid-20th century American design. Some elements of the room were retained, such as the buffet table. New red drapes, influenced by the 1961 Kennedy redesign but less formal, graced the windows. The room's new brown, beige, black, and white rug has a design adapted from the 1950 work Black, White, and Gray by textile artist Anni Albers. The silver tea service was manufactured by Graff, Washbourne, & Dunn of New York City and was manufactured for the 1939 New York World's Fair. The service is accompanied by ceramic, porcelain, and glass servingware. The World's Fair servingware and other 20th century American tableware are on display in the Philadelphia bookcase (which is against the south wall), while the tea service is on display on the sideboard on the west wall. A mirror replaced C. Gregory Stapko's 1952 portrait of Frances Folsom Cleveland over the fireplace in the east wall. The mirror has a historic connection to the room: It was present in the room in 1901 when President Theodore Roosevelt hosted a dinner attended by Booker T. Washington. (The informal event triggered protests by racists who opposed African Americans as guests in the White House.) A 1902 portrait of Edith Roosevelt by Theobald Chartran was taken down from the west wall, and the 1998 Robert Rauschenberg work Early Bloomer [Anagram (A Pun)] took its place. On the north wall, a mirror was removed and replaced with the 1966 Alma Thomas work Resurrection. On the south wall are two paintings by Josef Albers: the 1963 Study for Homage to the Square: Asking and the 1966 Homage to the Square. Use of the Family Dining Room President Abraham Lincoln and his family used the Family Dining Room frequently. Presidents throughout the 1800s and 1900s continued to use it for private family dining, but nearly all disliked it, finding it too cavernous. In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy had a new kitchen and President's Dining Room created on the Second Floor of the White House, which largely ended the practice of the First Family eating in the Family Dining Room. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, Jacqueline Kennedy asked that a Mass be held in the White House at 10:00 AM on November 23. White House Chief Usher J. B. West initially had the Family Dining Room set for this service. But Jacqueline Kennedy asked that the Mass be moved, and it was held in the State Dining Room instead. (A second Mass, held on November 24 at 11:15 AM, was held in the East Room.) When events are held in the State Dining Room, the Family Dining Room is often used as a pantry. Since the White House kitchen is on the mansion's Ground Floor, this helps alleviate many of the inconveniences which occur when moving food, china, and serving dishes up to the State Floor. On February 10, 2015, the Family Dining Room was opened to the public for the first time as part of the White House Tour.

In 1930, more than 30,000 people jammed Notre Dame Stadium to watch Mishawaka beat undefeated South Bend Central, 6-0. At the time, it was one of the largest crowds to witness a high school football game in the United States. Indiana high school football is still immensely popular, with tens of thousands now packing Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis to watch six state championship games over two days in November. The following is a history of Indiana's big school state football championship.  1920-1936: The North and mythical state champions  From the late 1800s through 1919, Indiana high school football teams often played fewer than five games per year and many times skipped entire seasons. Pre-1920 games often featured high school teams playing semi-pro club teams, college teams, and even intramural scrimmages. Various teams made state championship claims, but most were unfounded until organized leagues and verified games became commonplace beginning with the 1920 season. By that year, as many as 26 high schools in northern Indiana — stretching from Fort Wayne to East Chicago — were annually compiling standings and functioning as the state’s first organized football conference. These northern football teams frequently defeated powerhouse teams from other states and were rarely defeated by Indiana teams from outside the league. For example, From 1921 to 1926, Gary Emerson never lost a game to an in-state team. The winner of this early super conference usually claimed the \\"mythical\\" state football championship prior to 1928. Indeed, when an Indiana mythical state championship game was played between the best teams of northern and southern Indiana (in 1923, 1924, 1927,19’29, and 1930)n the northern league champion won every time. In 1926, for one year, the league standings included power teams from around the state, including Evansville Central, Richmond, Indianapolis Tech, Marion, and Muncie, all of whom finished behind league leaders Mishawaka and Gary Emerson. In 1927, many of these same northern teams – from Elkhart to East Chicago – officially formed the Northern Indiana Conference (NIC), with its champion going on to dominate the #1 final ranking in the AP and UPI polls well into the 1960s. By the early 1930s, the Evansville and Terre Haute areas were also well established as Indiana high school football hotbeds. Clinton (north of Terre Haute) won three titles between 1928 and 1933, and Evansville Memorial, best in the south in 1937, defeated McKeesport, champions of Western Pennsylvania, 21-0, in what some newspapers called the mythical national championship.

Although the majority of all homicides in New York City occur within the confines of this neighborhood, BSVAC remains the dominant ambulance service. Programs When BSVAC first started its program, the average response time in Bed-Stuy for city ambulances averaged 30 mins. BSVAC established responses to emergency calls with an average response time of less than four minutes. BSVAC has established a neighborhood first aid center. BSVAC has a Youth Corps program that provides CPR, first aid and basic emergency medical training to teens and young adults. A program for younger children, called the Trauma Troopers, has also been developed by BSVAC. BSVAC has reached out to other minority communities, from Harlem, New York to Los Angeles, California, providing emergency medical training and assistance in setting up programs. Awards BSVAC has received the Robin Hood Foundation Hero of the Year Award, New York City Hero Award, American Institute for Public Service Jefferson Award, Thousand Points of Light Award (awarded by President George H.W.

Composed in 1947, it was first performed in London on 24 October 1948, conducted by Roger Désormière. The work, light and full of dance rhythms, is in four movements.  History  Poulenc, who initially was urged to study business by his parents, came to music late, without much formal education. He scored a success with a full-length ballet, Les biches, written on a commission by Diaghilev and premiered in Monte Carlo in 1924. A young audience cherished the unsophisticated fresh charm, and the composer received commissions in the wake of the success. He composed the Sinfonietta in 1947 on a commission from the BBC for the tenth anniversary of their Third Programme. It was first performed in a broadcast concert in London on 24 October 1948, played by the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Roger Désormière. Poulenc made his first concert tour to the U.S. the same year, which increased his international recognition.  Structure  The composition, Poulenc's only symphonic work, is in four movements: # Allegro con fuoco # Molto vivace # Andante cantabile # Très vite et très gai The work is light and full of dance rhythms, at times satirical. The first movement begins force but is contrasted with melodic elements. The second movement of scherzo character is reminiscent of the last movement of the ballet Les biches, and has \\"brief misterioso moments\\". The third movement is gentle, with an expansive melodic theme. The final recalls last movements by Haydn with \\"folksy\\" themes, and \\"scurries along to a breathless conclusion\\". = Scoring = The Sinfonietta is scored for a small symphony orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in Bb, 2 bassoons, 2 French horns (in F), 2 trumpets in C, harp, timpani (4), and strings.

Early life Born in Mantua, he was the third child of Frederick II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and Margaret Palaeologina. At the age of 10 he was sent to Paris to inherit the assets left by his grandmother, Anne d'Alençon, widow of Marquess William IX of Montferrat. He entered Henry II of France's army and fought in the battle of St. Quentin (1557), where he was taken prisoner by the Spanish. Marriage and townhouse in Paris Louis de Nevers and his spouse On 4 March 1565 Louis Gonzaga married Henriette of Cleves, heiress to the Duchies of Nevers and Rethel. Thereafter he was known as the Duke of Nevers. Their son Charles became duke of Mantua in 1627, establishing the Gonzaga-Nevers line. Charles' grandson, Charles II, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat, sold the titles of Nevers and Rethel to Cardinal Mazarin in 1659.NEVERS and the Counts of Nevers. Louis, Duke of Nevers, and his wife had five children: *Catherine Gonzaga (21 January 1568 – 1 December 1629), married Henry I, Duke of Longueville *Maria Henrietta Gonzaga (3 September 1571 – 3 August 1614), married Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne *Frederick Gonzaga (11 March 1573 – 22 April 1574). *Francis Gonzaga (17 September 1576 – 13 June 1580). *Charles I, Duke of Mantua (6 May 1580 – 20 September 1637). In 1572 Nevers purchased from the French king, Charles IX, the Grand Nesle, an old townhouse located just east of the Tour de Nesle on the Left Bank of Paris. Nevers had it reconstructed, after which it became known as the Hôtel de Nevers.Braham and Smith 1973, p. 238. Although it was never completed, it was greatly admired by contemporaries. Nevers' secretary, Blaise de Vigenère, a distinguished antiquarian and art historian, wrote that the house had a vault, built by Italian workmen, which was more grand than the one at the Baths of Caracalla. Although De Vigenère likely overstated the size, it must have been very impressive and was an architectural feature that was new to Paris.Thomson 1984, p. 137. Later life Nevers became one of the important patrons of the arts and sciences in 16th-century France. He fostered faience production in the Duchy of Nevers, beginning in 1588 under the Italian masters, the brothers Augustin Conrade, Baptiste Conrade, and Dominique Conrade from Albisola, and Giulio Gambin, who had worked in Lyon.Riccardi-Cubit 1996, p. 604. Nevers is also considered by many historians as one of the courtiers most responsible for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572. He died at Nesle in 1595.

Structure editors can be used to edit hierarchical or marked up text, computer programs, diagrams, chemical formulas, and any other type of content with clear and well-defined structure. In contrast, a text editor is any document editor used for editing plain text files. Typically, the benefits of text and structure editing are combined in the user interface of a single hybrid tool. For example, Emacs is fundamentally a text editor, but supports the manipulation of words, sentences, and paragraphs as structures that are inferred from the text. Conversely, Dreamweaver is fundamentally a structure editor for marked up web documents, but supports the display and manipulation of raw HTML text as well. Similarly, molecule editors typically support both graphical and textual input. Structure editing predominates when content is graphical and textual representations are awkward, e.g., CAD systems and PowerPoint. Text editing predominates when content is largely devoid of structure, e.g., text fields in web forms. WYSIWYG word processing systems such as Word, which appear to edit formatted text directly, are essentially structure editors for the underlying marked-up text. In linguistics, syntax is the study of the structure of grammatical utterances, and accordingly syntax- directed editor is a synonym for structure editor. Language-based editor and language-sensitive editor are also synonyms. A language-based editor's features may be implemented by ad hoc code or by a formal grammar. For example, language sensitivity in Emacs is implemented in the Lisp definition of the edit mode for the given language. In contrast, language sensitivity in an XML editor is driven by a formal DTD schema for the given language. Although structured editors allow the viewing and manipulation of the underlying document in a structured manner, the file format in which the document is stored on disk may or may not be heavily structured and may or may not be open or standardized (e.g., plain text versus Microsoft Word documents). Structure editing has often been employed in source code editors, as source code is naturally structured by the syntax of the computer language. However, most source code editors are instead text editors with additional features such as syntax highlighting and code folding, rather than structure editors. The editors in some integrated development environments parse the source code and generate a parse tree, allowing the same analysis as by a structure editor, but the actual editing of the source code is generally done as raw text. Each programming language typically has a well-defined syntax given by a context-free grammar, and accordingly the meaningful structural elements in source code written in the language correspond to the grammatical phrases in the text. Early syntax-directed source code editors included Interlisp-D (for Lisp’s limited syntax) and Emily (for PL/I’s rich syntax). A syntax-directed editor may treat grammar rules as generative (e.g., offering the user templates that correspond to one or more steps in a formal derivation of program text) or proscriptive (e.g., preventing a phrase of a given part of speech from being moved to a context where another part of speech is required) or analytic (e.g., parsing textual edits to create a structured representation). Structure editing features in source code editors make it harder to write programs with invalid syntax. Language-sensitive editors may impose syntactic correctness as an absolute requirement (e.g., as did Mentor), or may tolerate syntax errors after issuing a warning (e.g., as did the Cornell Program Synthesizer). Strict structured editors often make it difficult to perform edits that are easy to perform with plain text editors, which is one of the factors contributing to the lack of adoption of structured editing in some domains, such as source code editing. Some syntax-directed editors monitor compliance with the context-sensitive constraints of a language such as type correctness. Such static-semantic constraints may be specified imperatively by actions (e.g., as in Gandalf), or declaratively by an attribute grammar (e.g., as in the Synthesizer Generator) or by unification in a many-sorted algebra (e.g., as in PSG ) or a logic program (e.g., as in Centaur and Pan), with compliance checked by the underlying editing machinery. Structured editors vary in the degree to which they allow their users to perform edits that cause the document to become syntactically or semantically incorrect. It is common for a language sensitive editor to represent a document as a parse tree with respect to language's grammar, or as an abstract syntax tree (AST). For example, a DOM tree is essentially an AST with respect to a given DTD. Frequently, the textual view of that underlying tree is generated by prettyprinting the underlying tree. Editors associated with intentional programming and language-oriented programming for general-purpose languages and domain-specific languages share many of the features of language-sensitive editors, but aim for greater separation between the underlying representation (the intention) and the surface representation (text in a programming language).

Turin, 21 April 1847 – Genova, 9 June 1915) was an Italian violin maker of the 19th and the 20th Centuries and son of Giuseppe Rocca. Although he worked differently from his father Giuseppe Rocca, Enrico's work takes more inspiration from Eugenio Praga.  Biography  Enrico Rocca was son of Giuseppe, who is considered probably the most important maker of the 19th century; Enrico had a very hard life and he wasn't trained all the way by his father. The loss of his father at the age of 19 forced him to run away from his family. He ended up working as a boatman, a sailor, a ship carpenter (for many years) and a woodworker. He opened his workshop in 1878. After twenty years passed on the docks of the port of Genova, he began violin making building mainly six strings lombard mandolins and guitars; he started making violins only after 1890. By the turn of the century and after Praga's death (1901), Enrico Rocca became the pre-eminent violin maker in Genoa. His work is always dominated by a great spontaneity and reveals a strong personality. He was consistent in his production as well as style till his death. His preferred models were Guarneri, Stradivari and Amati. Enrico Rocca's instruments are much appreciated today.

South of the street is the statue of Charles XIV John, the creation of Bengt Erland Fogelberg and inaugurated in 1854. Järntorgsgatan leads north to the square Järntorget. History While the street was created together with the statue in 1854 as a by-product of Nils Ericsson's construction of the third lock guiding the water flow from Lake Mälaren to the Baltic Sea, the name came into official use in 1872. An alley named Kvarnhusgatan passing between the block north of the street and a mill was discontinued together with the latter. The street and the area around it was considerably altered following the reconstruction of the Slussen area completed in 1935. The botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), while living on Österlånggatan during the period 1738–1741, had his consulting rooms in the so-called Räntmästarhuset (literally: \\"Interest Master's Stairs\\", meaning: \\"Stairs of the Director of the Financial Administration\\"), once located on number 9.

Following his debut in Paris on June 6, 1906, he appeared successfully in London and Vienna. His first American appearance as soloist came with the New York Symphony on November 8, 1908. A year later he soloed with the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra when that orchestra toured the United States. In 1916, he was recognized as a national honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music. During World War I, Spalding served in the U.S. Army Air Corps (at one point as aide-de-camp to then-Congressman Fiorello La Guardia) and would eventually be awarded the Cross of the Crown of Italy. Not long after his return to the United States, he married Mary Vanderhoef Pyle on July 19, 1919, in Ridgefield, Connecticut. French violinist Jacques Thibaud and Andre Benoist, Spalding's accompanist, provided the music for the ceremony. In 1920, Spalding appeared on the European tour of the New York Symphony. In 1922, he became the first American violinist to appear with the Paris Conservatory Orchestra; a year later he was the first American to serve on a jury at the Paris Conservatory, helping to award prizes to the graduating class of violinists. In February 1941, he premiered the violin concerto of Samuel Barber. Upon the United States' involvement in World War II, Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle successfully urged Spalding to accept an assignment with the Office of Strategic Services. He was posted to London, for six weeks, and then served in North Africa until he was ordered to Naples where he was attached to the Psychological Warfare Division of SHAEF. In 1944, Spalding gave a legendary concert to thousands of terrified refugees stranded in a cave near Naples during a bombing raid. Following a concert in New York on May 26, 1950, Spalding announced his retirement from the concert stage. Thereafter, he taught master classes at Boston University College of Music and, in the winter months, at Florida State University. His last recital, with pianist Jules Wolffers, at Boston University on 15 May 1953 was preserved on record (LP 33 rpm, Halo 50296  ℗1957). Ten days later he died in Manhattan, New York City, at the age of 64. Legacy He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.Delta Omicron Works Spalding wrote several musical compositions including a suite for orchestra, two violin concerti and a String Quartet in E Minor. He also wrote an autobiography, Rise to Follow, published in 1943. His novel about Giuseppe Tartini, A Fiddle, a Sword, and a Lady, appeared in 1953. Recordings =Individual 78 RPM sides and album sets= During the 78 era, when the maximum capacity of a single ordinary record side or cylinder was less than five minutes, Spalding recorded extensively for Edison Records, with some issues on cylinders and many more on diamond discs. Most featured short works or encore pieces that could fit on a single record side. These recordings were all by the acoustical process, as well as vertically-cut, through 1925, but he made his first electrical recordings in 1926 for Brunswick Records using that company's problematic \\"Light-Ray\\" system. After his unsatisfactory experience with Brunswick, Spalding went back to Edison and made some electrical Edison hill-and-dale Diamond Discs as well as a very few Edison \\"Needle Cut\\" lateral recordings in late 1928. These were much better recorded than Spalding's Brunswicks, but the Diamond Discs sold as scantily as the rest of Edison's product in that period, and the \\"Needle-Cut\\" discs were issued only for a very short time—from August to November 1929—and are exceedingly rare today. Following the Edison company's demise in November 1929, he recorded a handful of more extended works broken across multiple sides for RCA Victor Records. =Long playing records= Spalding's role as a leading Edison artist secured him representation on the first long-playing records: Edison's commercially ill- fated long-playing diamond discs, introduced in 1926, which were capable of playing up to 20 minutes per side at 80 RPM. Because, like all material on these pioneering records, his selections were dubbed from standard diamond disc masters, they represented the same short pieces in his standard catalogue. At the end of his life, Spalding again appeared on LP records, this time budget issues by small labels, but performing more substantial fare. Particularly of note are his accounts of the Beethoven and Brahms violin concerti recorded for Remington Records in Vienna, Austria's Brahms Hall in 1952, his last recording sessions. In both, Wilhelm Loibner conducted an ensemble billed as the Austrian Symphony Orchestra. For the same company Spalding earlier recorded the three Brahms violin sonatas with pianist Ernő Dohnányi; selected Brahms Hungarian Dances with pianists Dohnányi and Anthony Kooiker,Rec: 1950 / 12\\", 33 rpm, Remington RLP-199-23 / ℗1951 who toured with Spalding for four years; and a collection of music by Tartini, Corelli, and J.S. Bach, some in his own arrangements, with Kooiker. A recital of short pieces issued on the Halo label, with accompanist Jules Wolffers, captures Spalding's voice as he announces two of the works.

In the 19th century, it was completely restored and covered with glazed burgundy tiles. It is located in the commune of La Rochepot in the Côte-d'Or department, Bourgogne-Franche- Comté, France. History The castle was built in 1180 on the ruins of a castle burnt down in the 11th century. It belonged to seigneur de Montagu Alexander of Burgundy (1170-1205) (son of Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy). Nowadays, these ruins are located in the nearby forest.

He renamed it after himself and transferred it to his son, seigneur Jacques Pot, who, in turn, transferred it to his son, seigneur Philippe Pot. After seigneur Régnier Pot bought the castle, Pinot noir grapes started being planted in its vicinity – as application of the Decree of Philip the Bold of 1395. In the 16th century, Marshal of France Anne de Montmorency became the owner of the castle (he possessed more than 130 castles). In the 17th century, Jean François Paul de Gondi, the Cardinal de Retz, inherited the castle and, in 1644, he sold it to the cavalier and first President of the Parliament of Burgundy Pierre Legoux de la Berchère. Joseph Blancheton was the last lord of the castle. In 1789, during the French Revolution, castle was renamed Château de La Roche Fidèle, declared a national asset, and afterwards was partially destroyed by vandals. Left without the keep, the domain passed from hand to hand. In 1893, Cécile Carnot (the wife of Sadi Carnot, President of the Republic) purchased the ruins and offered them as a gift to her eldest son, infantry colonel Sadi Carnot (1865-1948), who during 26 years carried out a great and meticulous historical restoration in the spirit of the 15th century. In 2013, some parts of the castle were acknowledged as regional historical monuments. In 2014, annex buildings, vineyards and the park were given the status of national monument. In October 2018, the castle was seized by the French government after investigation into an alleged money laundering scheme by Dmytro Malynovskyi, a Ukrainian. Malynovski was arrested after an investigation into a corruption and money laundering scheme in which he purchased and lived in the castle after faking his own death.

He was a physician who devoted much of his time to helping the poor and sick. He turned his home into a free clinic, providing his patients with food and lodging as well as medical care. He was later ordained a priest by the patriarch. When the Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great became ill he sent for Sampson to cure him. He was the only physician in the city to do the emperor any good, and the emperor wanted to reward him. Sampson requested that the emperor help him establish a new hospital for the poor. With the emperor's assistance Sampson founded the hospital, which became the largest free clinic in the empire and served the people of Constantinople for 600 years. Sampson was buried in the Church of the Holy Martyr Mocius in Constantinople. It was on his feast day that Peter the Great defeated Charles XII of Sweden in the Battle of Poltava.

It was unique among by-elections since 1918 in that one of the candidates was the sitting Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home; he was nominated for the constituency after disclaiming a peerage, as he felt he needed to be a member of the Commons rather than the House of Lords during his premiership. Douglas-Home won the election. Candidates The by-election was caused when Scottish Office Minister Gilmour Leburn died while on holiday on 15 August 1963. The constituency of Kinross and West Perthshire, a large rural area at the southern end of the Scottish Highlands, was the safest Conservative seat in Scotland (majority 12,248 in 1959) and a plum seat for any Conservative candidate. On 11 September, the Executive of Kinross and West Perthshire Unionist Association selected Hon. George Younger, a 31-year-old heir of the Scottish aristocracy who was looking to make a start in national politics. On 11 October the required notice was given to the Speaker of the vacancy (the House being in recess) so that the writ for a new election would be issued. On 17 October the full membership of the Unionist Association adopted Younger as its candidate. However, the emergence of the Earl of Home as the new Leader of the Conservative Party and his appointment as Prime Minister on 19 October led to a sudden requirement to find him a seat in the House of Commons. Douglas- Home's Scottish ancestry made him look with particular interest at Kinross and West Perthshire; speculation earlier in the week had already linked him with it. On Sunday 20 October, Younger announced his offer to withdraw in favour of Home, an offer which was graciously accepted. Younger was later selected for Ayr, which he represented from 1964 to 1992. On 23 October, Home executed an instrument of disclaimer under the Peerage Act 1963, becoming Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The new session of Parliament was delayed to await the outcome of the by-election. The Labour Party chose Andrew Forrester, a 25-year-old schoolteacher from Glasgow who was Chairman of Scotstoun Young Socialists. The Liberal Party nominated Alistair Duncan Millar, a son of James Duncan Millar who farmed in Perthshire. The Scottish National Party leader Arthur Donaldson, a 62-year-old journalist who had fought Dundee in the 1945 general election, was also nominated. With a sitting Prime Minister fighting a by-election, interest was high and three additional candidates stood. Willie Rushton, the satirist and broadcaster, was put up as an Independent candidate by Private Eye magazine. Ian Smith, a 43-year-old former Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force and now garage owner of Callander, stood as an Independent Unionist. A last-minute candidate appeared in the shape of Richard Wort, a schoolmaster from Wimbledon who stood as an Independent right-wing candidate; his nomination paper was handed in with 29 minutes to spare. On the eve of poll, Willie Rushton announced that he was retiring from the contest, and endorsed Liberal Party candidate Alistair Duncan Millar, who he thought stood the best chance of defeating Douglas-Home. Result The result was declared from the County Buildings in Perth, shortly after noon on Friday 8 November. Douglas- Home won with a majority of 9,328, and all but he and the Labour and Liberal candidates forfeited their deposits. He went on to represent the constituency until the October 1974 general election.

It is a part of the Vuoksi River basin, constituting its southern armlet, and drained by Burnaya River. Originally waters of Lake Suvanto (Lake Sukhodolskoye) quietly flowed into Vuoksi through a waterway at Kiviniemi. However, in 1818 the channel that had been dug to drain spring flood waters from Suvanto into Lake Ladoga unexpectedly turned into Taipaleenjoki (Burnaya River), which started draining Suvanto and decreased its level by 7 m. The Kiviniemi waterway dried out. In 1857 a channel was dug there, but the stream reversed direction, revealed rapids and rendered navigation at Kiviniemi impossible. Since 1857 Lake Sukhodolskoye and Burnaya River have constituted the southern armlet of Vuoksi River, which has decreased the level of the original northern armlet flowing through Priozersk by 4 m.
