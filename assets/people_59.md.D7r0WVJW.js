As the connection between the three major cultural and geographic centres of Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Iranian plateau, the boundaries of the region prior to this time changed with the rapid advancement of armies, with the land belonging to a vast range of empires over the last two millennia. The diversity of Afghan history allows for the diversity that exists in the country's architecture and architectural remains, with influences ranging over time from Greek to Persian to Indian to Chinese and European in recent centuries. A range of religious influences over time are also reflected, with evidence primarily exhibiting early Buddhist, Zoroastrian and Islamic inspiration.  Architectural origins  With the advent of the Iron Age in Central Asia the first indications of circular city planning is evident, typical across the Iranian plateau from this point. The circular form most likely had defensive intent as their origin. Parts of the major historical cities such as Balkh and Kandahar have evidence of ramparts with foundations dated back to this period, with characteristic mud-brick construction and towers at regular intervals. A citadel was also commonly situated within the centre of these structures, evidence that these settlements also operated as administrative centres and market places. This tradition of defensive architecture was spread and maintained across much of Central Asia from these beginnings. = Hellenism from the West = Following Alexander the Great's conquest of the region in the 4th century BC and the subsequent rule of his Seleucid generals, Hellenistic influences strengthened previously extant connections to the West. This was particularly evident in the north of the region, while Mauryan rule continued in the south. Although temples retained their classic Iranian form, evidence of Greek motifs are extant in the decoration and layout of the structures, with sculptures being the key manifestation of Western art. The Greeks also influenced town planning with the introduction of the agora, or city centre square, with this tradition further developed in under the later Timurid rule.  Early Buddhist architecture  With the establishment of the Kushan empire both political and dynastic centres were established, with one such dynastic centre identified in Afghanistan at Surkh Kotal, established during the height of Buddhism in Afghanistan. Excavations of the site revealed a monumental set of stairs leading down the hillside from a Kushan temple, with these built in the first half of the 2nd century AD. Zoroastrian associations are possibly evident in fire worship symbols, and exist alongside Buddhist architectural features. Hellenistic pilasters and column bases alongside a limestone with Greek letter inscriptions of an unknown language are evidence of Western influence, while Iranian influences may also exist within the concept of a monumental dynastic centre. Artificial cave structures were a primary feature of Buddhist communities, with the caves utilised as sanctuaries and cells for Buddhist monks. The most prominent example of these in Afghanistan are in Bamiyan Province, which became the capital of Buddhism in the 4th century AD. Hundreds of these such caves exist at this site, which is also notable for its immense Buddha statues and their public destruction by the Taliban in 2001. = The stupa= Stupa excavated 35km from Kabul, Afghanistan Within this period came the widespread construction of the stupa, a key architectural form of the early Buddhist period. This structure developed from the original earthen mounds built in north-eastern India following the death of Buddha, with the role of the structure progressing from a commemorative reliquary to a place of worship itself. This occurred around the 3rd century BC with the opening of the original stupas by Emperor Ashoka in order to utilise relics to disseminate the religion, coinciding with the dissemination of the structure itself. With this development of purpose came a lengthy and complex development of form, from an earthen mound to solid masonry structures consisting of a square base beneath a hemispheric dome. Eventually, this form came to be dwarfed by an adornment of a mast featuring seven umbrella-like discs, or chakras, each representing a different layer of heaven. These structures were rarely isolated, with other stupas and traditional Buddhist monasteries and chapels commonly in the vicinity. Despite the incorporation of much of Afghanistan into the Sassanian empire in the 3rd century AD, the region was never fully conquered and regional architectural development was relatively unaffected. The Sassanids were succeeded through the invasion of the Hephthalites in the 5th century AD. There is some conjecture around the extent to which the destructive nature of the Hephthalites extended to their time in Afghanistan, although scholars agree that local Buddhist influence was not totally eliminated in this period. Buddhism therefore continued in the region until the arrival of Islam with the Abbasids. Despite the prominence and duration of Buddhist influence in Afghanistan prior to this period, the religion and any influence it had on architectural structures was entirely eliminated under Islamic rule.  Early Islamic architecture  The initial spread of Islam to Afghanistan occurred around the 8th century AD, with Abbasid rule succeeded by Saffarids and later Samanids to 961 AD. Following this point in time Afghanistan was established as the centre of Islamic civilisation under the Ghaznavid Empire, succeeded by the Ghorids until 1219. = The mausoleum= Mausoleum at Mazar-I Sharif The mausoleum was a significant Islamic structure, with the great distance between the Afghanistan region and Mecca elevating the structures enshrining holy men to alternative focal points for the required pilgrimage to the city. At Mazar-i Sharif there exists evidence of this in the great shine of 'Ali, the fourth Sunni rightly guided Caliph, which today remains a point of great pilgrimage for the Sunni Muslim population in Afghanistan. The form of a mausoleum typically involved either a domed square chamber or a conical cupola atop a tower. An iwan, an ornamental vaulted entrance portal, was a common later additions subsequently a key feature. The iwan originated in pre-Islamic Central Asia, and saw itself incorporated into many mausoleum and mosque designs with the Islamic expansion, particularly in architecture of the later Timurid period. It was also maintained as a prominent feature of secular architecture, with pre- Islamic evidence in the palace architecture at Ai Khanum, and a later Islamic example at the 12th century AD Ghaznavid palace at Lashkari Bazar. The dome was another essential form utilised particularly in mausoleums and mosques. = The mosque= Another key impact of Islamic rule on the architecture in Afghanistan was the introduction of the universal religious building of the mosque, with aspects of the basic structure dictated by the religion itself. A mosque must face Mecca, or qibla, the direction of prayer, and contain a mihrab or prayer niche within the qibla wall. An ablution area allows for the requirement of cleanliness before prayer, and a clean, covered floor allows for the touching of the head on the ground during prayer. With the Qur'an restricting depictions of animals or the human form, decoration of Islamic structures evolved with a more abstract aspect than previous eras. Much of this decoration utilised the literal text of the Qur'an. Ghorid minaret at Jam A markedly Iranian influence is notable in the subsequent Ghaznavid and Ghorid periods, were tiles were arranged to form decorative inscriptions making up entire walls, a tradition later greatly developed in the Timurid era. Mosques were generally based on a four-iwan plan with a central dome chamber. The oldest Islamic structure in Afghanistan is a square, nine-domed mosque at Balkh, built by the Abbasids in the 9th century AD. = The minaret= The 65-metre Ghorid minaret at Jam ‚Äì one of two surviving monuments in Afghanistan from this period ‚Äì and the two minarets at Ghazni are often cited as the most exceptional examples of this Islamic architectural tradition. These particular minarets themselves are also evidence of the variety in form that existed in minaret erection, with the former a colossal three-story minaret and the two latter small and star-shaped. With their height serving the purpose of marking the site of a religious structure, minarets almost always accompanied a mosque, and could either exist in connection to it or freestanding. There were few monuments in Afghanistan from the Abbasid, Saffarid, Ghaznavid, Seljuk, Ghorid, and Khwarezmian periods to survive the later destruction with the coming of the Mongols, although examples of Ghaznavid, Ghorid and Seljuk architecture remain and continued in India during this period under the Sultans of Ghor.  Timurid architecture  In 1219, the Ghorid empire was overthrown in Afghanistan with the invasion of the Genghis Khan. As well as causing widespread destruction \\"leaving Afghanistan in ruins\\", the coming of the Mongols halted the development of new architecture as virtually all artistic activity in the region was eliminated. This remained the case until Timur assumed leadership of the Mongols in the late 14th century AD. Although subjecting the land to wars similar to those experienced under Genghis, Timur is also accredited with initiating the rebuilding of some of the regions culturally significant urban centres ruined by the Mongol conquest. Administration of this did not really occur in Afghanistan until the beginning of the 15th century AD with the reign Timur's son Shah Rukh, where Timur's capital at Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan served as key inspiration for Shah Rukh's capital at Herat. Not much development occurred in the way of architectural form with comparison to design prior to the Mongol invasion. Reliance on the dome and iwan for the basis of structural design continued, with some evolutions: for example, the double dome became frequently used, where the iwan developed into a monumental entrance hall. Mosques rarely varied from the pre-Mongol design consisting of four iwans and a dome chamber forming the main prayer hall. These features accompany an emphasis throughout the Timurid period on giganticism and the conspicuous. Evidence of this remains in Samarkand with the colossal mosque of Bibi Khanum, built in honour of Timur's Chinese wife. Unlike architecture, considerable change did occur in the decoration and ornamentation of structures and monuments. Although small bricks had been utilised during the Ghaznavid and Ghorid periods, a key innovation of the Timurids was the introduction of glazed and polychrome tiles. Colours began with turquoise, white and royal blue and were followed by a myriad of shades and pigments, with these arranged into complicated and intertwining geometrical girikhs or knots. Featured decor included floral motifs, depictions of mountains and clouds, and ornamentation inspired by Chinese art. A preserved example of glazed tilework mihrab exists in the mosque of Hauz-i Karboz.  Contemporary architectural education  Kabul skyline, displaying both historical and contemporary buildings Beginning with the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, decades of war and destruction ensued in Afghanistan. This impacted architecture both through the destruction of historical buildings as well as the degradation of architectural education and engineering programs in the country's universities. With support from USAID, higher education in the field of architecture was introduced as a department under the Engineering Faculty at Kabul University in 1968. Both the Department of Architecture and the Engineering Faculty at Kabul University were not sustained after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, with focus shifting in 1980 to the Soviet-modelled Kabul Polytechnic Institute for architectural education. Here the Department of Architecture was closed after five years with the graduation of the 1985 cohort. Following the Soviet withdrawal in 1988, President Najibullah's government reinitiated the Engineering Faculty at Kabul University, with architectural education then available only at Kabul University and Kabul Polytechnic Institute despite the establishment of other universities across the country, such as at Herat and Kandahar. Education was hindered in Kabul due to unrest in the city, during which large parts of the city were also destroyed. In 2007, the University of Hartford College of Engineering, Technology and Architecture received funds to establish an architecture program and to rejuvenate the engineering program at the University of Herat. Theodore Sawruk, who travelled to Herat as one of the lead figures of the endeavour, noted that architecture as a profession had been replaced through the decades of war with engineering, where engineers had little design education due to an emphasis on practicality. This also lead to limited focus on restoration and historic preservation, which were incorporated into the program at the University of Herat along with courses surrounding stone masonry and Islamic architecture.

Cook was a founder and president of the Colored Women's League, which consolidated with another organization in 1896 to become the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), an organization still active in the 21st century. Cook supported voting rights and was a member of the Niagara Movement, which opposed racial segregation and African American disenfranchisement. In 1898, Cook publicly rebuked Susan B. Anthony, president of the National Woman's Suffrage Association, and requested she support universal suffrage following Anthony's speech at a U.S. Congress House Committee on Judiciary hearing. Early life Helen Cook was born to William Appo, a prominent musician, and Elizabeth Brady Appo, who owned a millinery business in New York. Because of William Appo's music career, the family lived in various cities, such as Baltimore and Philadelphia before settling permanently in New York. As a teenager, Helen Cook attended meetings about women's rights with her mother and self-identified with the women's cause: > I was born to an inheritance of appreciation and sympathy for the cause of > women's rights, my mother before me being so ardent a supporter of its > doctrines that I felt myself, in a measure, identified with it. Among my > earliest recollections are the Sunday afternoon meetings, held at the home > of Lucretia Mott, on Arch street, in Philadelphia... on one of those > occasions...I heard that eloquent advocate of human freedom, the English > abolitionist, George Thompson. As an adult, Cook attended the first suffrage convention held in Washington, D.C. in January 1869 and organized by the Universal Franchise Association. Leadership and activism =National Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Women and Children= In 1864 the National Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Women and Children was incorporated by an act of the United States Congress to provide \\"suitable home, board, clothing, and instructions, and to bring them under Christian influences\\". Elizabeth Keckley, seamstress and confident to former first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, was one of the founding association member. Helen Cook was a member for nearly 35 years and held various leadership positions. In 1880, she was the first African American woman to be elected Secretary of the association, a position she held for ten years. African-American men also supported the association. Frederick Douglass paid for life membership in 1866. Dr. Charles B. Purvis and James Wormely, owner of the Wormley's Hotel in Washington, D. C., joined the Board of Trustees in 1872. John F. Cook, Jr., Helen Cook's husband, joined the Board in 1885, provided financial assistance and helped influence Congress for continued funding. Congressional appropriations, though, ended in 1892. The Association maintained a building for the homeless and orphans at Eighth and Euclid Streets, Northwest with standing committees on Admission and Dismission, Household management, Education, and Clothing. At the time of her death, Helen Cook was President of the association. =Colored Women's League= In 1892, Helen Cook, Ida B. Bailey, Anna Julie Cooper, Charlotte Forten Grimk√©, Mary Jane Peterson, Mary Church Terrell, and Evelyn Shaw formed the Colored Women's League in Washington, D.C. The goals of the service- oriented club were to promote unity, social progress and the best interests of the African American community. Helen Cook was elected president. Cook wrote the first \\"Washington Letter\\" about the activities of the Colored Women's League (CWL) in The Woman's Era (1894-1897), the first national newspaper published for and by African American women. Cook shared the CWL's 1894 accomplishments that included raising $1,935 towards a permanent league home; hosting a series of public lectures for girls at a local high school and at Howard University; the establishment of CWL-sponsored classes in German, English literature and hygiene; the establishment of a sewing school and mending bureau with 88 students and ten teachers; the payment of tuition for two nursing students and part salary to hire a kindergartner teacher. CWL member Mary Church Terrell provided subsequent updates from Washington, D.C. league efforts to the newspaper. In May 1898, Helen Cook spoke at the Second Annual Convention of the National Congress of Mothers, held in Washington, D.C. The National Congress of Mothers was the forerunner to today's National Parent Teachers Association. In her speech \\"We Have Been Hindered: How Can We Be Help?\\", she denounced those who identify negative behavior traits as inherent among African American instead of looking at the negative traits as a response to the effects of poverty and prejudice. W.E.B. DuBois also appeared at the Congress of Mothers Conference and, on May 6, presented a paper titled \\"The History of the Negro Home\\". Later in 1898, W.E.B. DuBois invited Helen Cook to submit a paper for the third annual Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems held at Atlanta University. The purpose of the conference series (1896-1914) was to identify difficulties the African American community faced and suggest solutions. Others invited to submit papers included Rev. Henry Hugh Proctor of First Congregational Church (Atlanta, Georgia), journalist and attorney Lafayette M. Hershaw, and Miss Minnie L. Perry, board member of the Carrie Steele Orphanage. Helen Cook's paper outlined the accomplishments of the CWL, including the enrollment of more than 100 children in its kindergartens. Over time, the Colored Women's League established a training center for kindergarten teachers as well as maintained seven free kindergartens and several day nurseries. The league also established sewing schools, night schools and penny-saving banks. By 1903, the league had a permanent building at 1931 12th Street, Northwest which offered temporary room, board and a day nursery. Additionally, with Helen Cook still the elected president, the organization had the largest membership of any African American women's club in the country, according to historian Fannie Barrier Williams. From its inception, league members envisioned a national organization, according to an 1893 article by founding member, Mary Church Terrell. \\"The Colored Women's League recently organized in Washington has cordially invited women in all parts of the country to unite with it, so that we may have a national organization,\\" she wrote. =First National Conference of Colored Women of America= Officers of Convention of 1895. Historical Records of Conventions of 1895-96 of the Colored Women of America] In 1895, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, president of the Woman's Era Club of Boston, invited all African American women to convene for a three day conference in Boston to discuss critical issues related to Black women's \\"moral, mental, physical and financial growth and well-bring\\" following disparaging remarks about the character of African American women by John Jacks, president of the Missouri Press Association. The Colored Women's League and twenty-four other clubs nationally attended the First National Conference of Colored Women of America July 29-31, 1895. Officers of the Convention were responsible for making conference arrangements and included Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, president; Mrs. Hannah Smith, recording secretary, Mrs. Florida Ruffin Ridley, corresponding secretary, and Miss. Eliza Gardner, chaplain. Elected convention officers included Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, president; Helen A. Cook and Margaret Murray Washington, vice-presidents; Eliza Carter and Mrs. Hannah Smith, secretaries. Helen Cook gave an address, titled \\"The Ideal National Union\\" on the first day of the convention calling for unity and outlining the goals and purpose of a national organization supporting Black woman. Cook also spoke about a vision for a national organization on the last day of the conference. Mrs. Victoria Earle Matthews presented a resolution asking that a national organization be formed. An additional day was added to the convention and held at Charles St. Church to further discuss creating a national organization. The resolution passed and a committee was formed to work through the details of a national organization. = Second National Conference of Colored Women of America= A year later African American women clubs from across the country gathered in Washington, D.C. for a convention of the National Federation of Afro American Woman with Mrs. Booker T. Washington presiding. On July 20, 1896, the second day of the convention, a motion passed for a committee to form to create a union between the National Federation of Afro American Women and the Colored Women's League. The new organization, the National Association of Colored Women, elected Mary Church Terrell as its first president. =Admonishing Susan B. Anthony= On February 15, 1898, the House Committee on Judiciary heard from representatives of the National Woman's Suffrage Association (NWSA) on a proposition to amend the United States Constitution and grant women's suffrage. Women's rights activist and NWSA president Susan B. Anthony spoke at the hearing of \\"ignoramuses who held the elective franchise\\". Anthony suggested the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, which would give citizens the right to vote, regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, humiliated [white American] women. Anthony said, according to one news account, \\"[T]he ballot ...is put in the hands of every man outside the State Prison, whether they have sufficient sense to cast their ballots or not, yet the women of the country were compelled to humiliate themselves in pleading for rights that should have been accorded them long ago.\\" Anthony continued and \\"drew comparisons between many of the ex-slaves and the large number of women of high intellectual rank compelled to acknowledge their political inferiority to these\\". Days later, Helen Cook responded \\"with pained surprise\\" to Susan B. Anthony's congressional testimony through a letter published in the Washington Post outlining Cook's own history engaged with women's rights. Cook appealed to Anthony to promote the cause of universal suffrage over disparaging \\"a noble manhood\\" or African American men. Cook noted Anthony's \\"great influence with other women...[and] power to direct their thoughts and endeavors\\" and suggested Anthony support universal suffrage before negative views about Black men and their suffrage gained greater popularity. =Niagara Movement= At nearly seventy years old, Helen Cook and her husband, John F. Cook, Jr., traveled to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia to attend the August 1906 national meeting of the Niagara Movement. The Niagara Movement (1905-1910) was an African American civil rights organization founded a year earlier by W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter to oppose racial segregation and African American disenfranchisement. John Cook attended as a member of the organization. At the meeting, after debate, it was decided women could become associate members, and Helen Cook became an associate member. Marriage and children Helen and John Francis Cook, Jr. married in 1864. He became the wealthiest African American resident in Washington, D.C. with a reported worth of $200,000 in 1895. His professional endeavors included an appointment as D.C.'s chief tax collector (1874 to 1884), serving as a trustee of Howard University (1874-1908), and partner with his brother, George F. T. Cook, and former congressman George Henry White in the firm Cook, Cook and White, which manufactured bricks from 1904 to 1906. The Cooks had five children, including Elizabeth Appo Cook (1864-1953), John Francis Cook, III (1868‚Äì1932), Charles Chaveau Cook (abt 1871‚Äì1910), George Frederick Cook (1874‚Äì1927), and Ralph Victor Cook (1875-1949). Death Helen Cook died from pneumonia and heart failure on November 20, 1913 in Washington, D.C. at the family Cook residence (1118 Sixteenth Street, Northwest). One African American newspaper noted that she was \\"easily the wealthiest colored woman in the District of Columbia. The Cook estate has been considered to be worth not less than a quarter of a million dollars...Mrs. Cook was greatly interested in Negro organizations and charity work and was a woman of kindly heart and broad sympathies.\\" Cook was buried at Columbian Harmony Cemetery, along with her late husband, John F. Cook, Jr. and other Cook family members. The law firm Carlisle, Luckett & Howe handled Cook's estate.

More energy and longer time are required for them to move from one place to another.  Chronic pain  Chronic pain causes stress and makes parents become less patient with their children in daily life. And more rest is needed, which limits the time allocated for parenting. The side effect caused by pain relief and other necessary medicines including possible addiction is another challenge faced by this kind of parents. = Mentally disabled parents = ‚ÄúMental or behavioral disorder includes psychoses, neuroses, intellectual and developmental disorders, and other mental or behavioral disorders. ‚Äù  Intellectual disabilities  Parents with intellectual disabilities face great discrimination when they try to maintain their families. They have difficulties at managing housing and financial issues because of their socio- economic disadvantage, which may lead to the result of having a debt. As their children grow up and have knowledge that is superior to parents‚Äô, new challenges like providing children with assistance on education and other kind of guidance come up. A 2018 systematic review found low quality evidence that some parents, mainly mothers with intellectual disabilities, provided effective parenting when provided training and support for the required skills.  Learning difficulties  Parents with leaning difficulties need help to process information and manage objectives. The way in which they gain and understand information is different from normal parents, which puts them under social criticism and stigma.  Young carer  The term ‚Äòyoung carer‚Äô means children who participate in taking care of their parents in life. = Types of caring activities provided by children = * Direct care for parents, including assist in parents‚Äô mobility and other personal cares like toileting, eating, communicating, showering and dressing. Among these assist in mobility is the most common direct assistance provided by young carers. * General household tasks, for example laundry, cooking, gardening and simple repairing works. Children participating in this form of assist occupy a greater portion than those helping with direct personal care. * Financial management like helping with money and bills, even work to earn for living expense.James, E. (2017). Still Hidden, Still Ignored Who cares for young carers?. [ebook] Barnardo's. Available at: https://www.barnardos.org.uk/still_hiddenstill_ignored_- _barnardo_s_young_carers_report.pdf [Accessed 29 May 2019]. Young boy at work = Age and identification = Comparing to children in young age, more children in high school age are taking the responsibility of caring for their disabled parents, which reflects that whether higher-aged children are more possible to have disabled parents or children of higher age are more often asked to provide their parents with assistance thanks to their higher-levelled capacity. According to the data resulted from the research, the local disabled parents in Leicester and Leicestershire of UK are less likely to identify children aged between 12 and 19 as young carers. This fact illustrates that rather than what children virtually do parents rely more on broader social relations within the family when they consider whether their children should be defined as ‚Äòyoung carers‚Äô. Whereas doctors depend on how much burden a child take in caring to identify young carers. School teachers play crucial role in identifying young carers in early age and offering help. The young carers identified by teachers are in averagely younger age than those identified by doctors, which makes it important for primary teaching institutions especially to identify young carers. = Why children become young carers = Participants from a Young Carers workshop held in Wellington, New Zealand in 2005 indicated that New Zealand children and young people become young carers mainly because of cultural expectations, nature of disability, awareness and acceptance of services, and other reasons relating to the family unit like no one else is taking the responsibility. = Impacts on young carers =  Negative  When young carers are not supported, negative outcomes will apply. These consequences involving both young carers‚Äô social and personal life. * Children's academic achievement is negatively impacted due to the time they spend on doing caring activities for disabled parents. Young carers‚Äô academic outcomes are below their peers and boys are effected more severely than girls. * Further study impacted. The number of young carers who want to continue studying in university is fewer than normal students, whether because of financial difficulties or need of time for caring. * Young carers are afraid of being seen differently. They feel anxious and worried.  Positive  * More mature than peers, greater sense of responsibility. They feel proud and happy to be able to care for families. = Support towards young carers = Large number of young carers have to sacrifice their future to take care of their family. Institutions that have close connection with young carers including schools and social service departments need to search for young carers and provide proper support. For example, transport services should be offered to children whose parents are unable to take them to school. School should train teachers to be aware of young carers and build special mechanism to assist young carers. Connection with other local young carer service institution also needs to be established. Other useful support include emotional support, opportunity of meeting others in similar situation, counseling and so on.  Effects on children  = About negative effects = The lack of relative research in this area leads to the prejudice that disabled parents bring negative effect, which is inaccurate. As high-quality studies state, the sources of problems happening in parenting with disability is the same as that in non-disabled parenting, which include parents' former experience of being abused physically, sexual, or on substance, poverty, lack of appropriate support and so on. The disability in parenting alone, is not the cause of negative impact to children. It is widely considered that children's participation in education will be negatively influenced by their parents‚Äô disability. 1998 Survey of Disability, Aging and Carers provided broad data showing this kind of impact is relatively low by comparing the number of children participating school from families with and without disabled parents. However the data does show that the existence of disabled parents will negatively influence further education. = About positive effects = Little difference is found between the household tasks done by children with or without disabled parents. And life details of children with disabled parents like the number of friend and activities they do with parents are almost same with those of children with normal parents. Children who have parents with disabilities even have an ‚Äúaverage to better-than-average‚Äù development. Children from the family with disabled parents are more skilled at solving problem, more compassionate, more respectful towards disabilities and differences, more sensitive about justice and more independent. Parents with intellectual disability always have a strong and warm family bonds with their children, even when some children were removed by welfare system. And most children of disabled parents regard their childhood as happy memory. Researchers at Israel's Bar Ilan University has delivered a study and the result shows that children who have parents with sensory impairment are more empathic and shows higher awareness of emotions of others than other children from normal families. Other advantages of children with disabled parents like greater maturity, higher sensitivity and more abundant life experience were also reported by earlier research.  The needed support  = How supports need to be = * Specialized support. Except for the universal needs of income, housing, access to leisure activities and other informal supports which are demanded by both disabled and non-disabled parents, parents with disabilities requires more specialized supports regarding to different conditions of their impairment. * In-time support. Instead of being provided when children have been in an urgent need of help, the support towards families with disabled parents is ideally supposed to be available throughout the whole parenting process from preparation of parenthood.Wheelchair * Flexible support. Depending on different stages of children's maturity and alterations in parents‚Äô health condition, the support needed varies. And the family as a whole and other non-disabled members of the family should also be taken into account when the assistant is offered. * Respect privacy. Not all parents with disabilities want their children or other family members to participate in the discussion about their disability when support is offered. = Types of needed support =  Peer support  which is the assistance from people in similar situation. It's of great importance since it provides parents with disability the opportunity of sharing and communicating with others who are experiencing similar life Owing to the scarce information about parenting with disability, the peer support network plays an even more significant role.  Support in education system  The facilities and environment of school should be accessible to all including disabled and normal parents, students and staffs. Inaccessible school facilities lead to lack of participation in children's school life for physically disabled parents. For parents with sensory impairment, appropriate way of communication with school is essential.  Need of special equipment  Parents of physical disability mention difficulties in taking care of children without proper equipment and with restriction in mobility. Deaf parents need equipment to be alerted when children are in need of help. Hearing Aid  Financial support  Comparing to normal parents, more disabled parents are not employed. Families with disabled parents also face extra expanse during daily life and parenting tasks due to their disability. They are more likely to suffer the pressure of poverty and depend on public benefit. There are this kind of family not qualified for financial support because of their medium income level, which prevent them from affording special equipment and services. The public benefit should be accessible towards disabled parents.  Physical and mental health care  Parents with disabilities face barrier when attempt to get access to health care, especially women. Professionals in health care hold negative attitudes towards disabled parents, and underestimate life quality of disabled people. Depression is another significant issue faced by disabled parents. Women with disability have six times more chance than normal women to have depression. Appropriate service and support is necessary for disabled mothers under the effect of depression.  Support in personal daily life  Large number of disabled parents reported the need of assistant in daily living activities like cooking, toileting and cleaning. Assistance in parenting tasks including taking recreational activities with children, carrying and holding children and so on are also reported as needed by parents with disabilities.

The act updates definitions to include same-sex relationships, death in marriages and De facto separation. It re-outlines requirements in to the division of property and aims to modernize past concepts of relationships, marriage and property involved in such arrangements. The amendment specifically states its recognition of male and female relationship equity, socioeconomic status, same sex relationships and children; providing updates in definition since development in related legislation. The main policy of the Property (Relationships) Amendment Act 2001 cites a goal for equal sharing of property from both relationship parties; upholding values of fairness and justice.  History  The Property (Relationships) Act 1976 was established to deal primarily with the division of the property of married, de facto and civil union couples upon divorce or separation. The initial act was known as the 'Matrimonial Property Act 1976, though was updated upon amendment due to changes in the New Zealand definition of what constitutes a legal relationship. This change in name was a part of the 2001 amendments despite confusion regarding its initial implementation in 1976. This act was amended again in 2005 following the controversial civil union Act 2004; making it legal for same-sex unions to be included under definition as a 'civil-union'. Changing family structures in New Zealand grew the necessity for an amendment to the seemingly outdated relationship definition in 2001. The addition of the 2001 amendments also sought to further include other circumstances that would otherwise effect the outcome of a division of property. This may include, but is not limited to socio-economic status, de facto relationships, civil unions, division of labour, marriage and native land issues.  Amendments  = Division of Property = The act is mainly applied to define the how property is divided upon termination, separation or death in/of a relationship. The act applies itself differently depending on type and length of relationship. Provisions of the act may also differ depending on whether both beneficiaries are alive or if one is deceased. Property is defined as family home (whenever acquired), all jointly owned property (whether acquired before or after the relationship occurred), proportion of the value of any life insurance policy, any policy of other insurance, proportion of superannuation value, any income or gains, etc. = Equal Sharing = In Section 1G(d): amended, on 26 April 2005, by section 3(4) of the Property (Relationships) Amendment Act 2005 (2005 No 19), it states that the assessment of the division of property in equal sharing must be noted by: what basis property is divided, relationship tenure of more than 3 years, living standards and income and marital contribution of each partner of the relationship to maintain equity in division. Part 5 of the act also addresses what rights secured and unsecured creditors maintain, and what extent may the share be of unsecured credits a spouse or partner has. The proceeding thus deals with general to more specific issues relating to the division of property but ultimately aims to maintain legal equity and 'fairness' in ultimatum. = New Additions = The 2001 amendment mainly addressed the recent legislative additions to the definition of a 'relationship' within New Zealand. The purpose of this act is to \\"reform the law relating to the property of married couples...recognize the equal contributions of husband and wife...and of de-facto partnership\\" and \\"...to provide for a just division of the relationship property...\\". The reformed principles of the act follow the guide that: \\"men and women have equal status\\", \\"all forms of contribution...[to the relationship]...have equal status\\", that a \\"just division of relationship property has regard to [socio-economic status]\\" and that \\"relationship property should be resolved as inexpensively, simply and speedily as is consistent with justice\\".  Criticism  There has been much academic criticism regarding the effectiveness of the act in cases of agriculture, native land and the general 'effectiveness' of the 2001 amendment. One of the main areas of criticism within the act has been the alleged prevalence of 'sham trusts', 'alter-ego' trusts, the bundle of rights doctrine and 'illusory trusts'. There is a common call for the clarification of definitions to include such cases. There is a growth in the idea that these issues do not allow the legislation to fulfil its original intention. Criticism has also been placed upon the lack of modernity the current amended act entails. = De-facto Relationships = Criticism regarding the balance of equity within the act has also been deconstructed. While the amendment balances gender position and re-defines relationship to broaden the individuals involved with property, some inconsistency regarding de facto pairings has been cited. Under the act's amendments, both married and civil union couples maintain higher access to compensation than unmarried de facto couples. The policy of the legislative landscape maintains itself under the guise of equal sharing and the definition and place of de facto relationships within the act therefore somewhat contradicts this. The de facto couple's place outlined in the amendment therefore incites conflict with the core directive of the Property (Relationships) Act. Therefore, the basis of this criticism stems from the contradiction of the act's purpose in maintaining equal sharing for both parties of a relationship against the lack of compensation in de facto pairings. This had led to proposition for change in up-holding policy purpose. = Socio-Economic Status = Issues regarding the just division of property amongst plaintiffs of varying socio-economic status has also been critiqued in recent years. The current Property (Relationships) Act under amendment does not account for equity in a relationship rather focusing on specifically financial and physical objects of a relationship; i.e. it does not account for a stay-at-home parent or other domestic duties. This division of labour both domestic and work-force related does not appear in detail under definition in the act's amendments and has been highly criticised due to a statistical shift of household labour in New Zealand; often leading to a financial disadvantage to partner A or B. For Example, Women are much more likely to leave the work force after pregnancy while their partners are also statistically likely to support the domestic arrangement financially; thus creating a financial divide between partners despite both individuals retaining a clear role within the familial unit. This inconsistency within definition has led to many cases being decided by court, which out of 15 cases over 16 years, has remained equally as inconsistent and conservative leading to the further call for change in the Amendment.  Notable Cases  = Ward v Ward = The Ward v Ward issue is a commonly presented case that showcases the implementation of the amended 2001 legislation. The couple were married for fourteen years in which the Mr Ward inherited a farming business. Legal advisers recommended the couple invest half the shares. The shares were then transferred in to a trust by the couple and soon began incurring debts owed by the trustees. Upon the couple's separation each plaintiff was owed equal from the incurred debts but the value of the farm had significantly increased in the period. This was noticeably less than what would have been received by Mrs Ward had her relationship property entitlement been retained through share ownership. As Mrs Ward was party to the disposition she retained no ability to s44 to claim that the outcome was to diminish her rights. However the balance of debt incurred outside of the investment trust was not sufficient to cover Mrs Ward's entitlement in the claim. Section 182 of the act therefore allowed Mrs Ward to provide compensation, and the court ordered 50% of the trust to be resettled separately. Had the claimants maintained a de facto relationship, section 182 would not have been lawful and Mrs Ward would not have received her perceived compensation and redress. This case is often cited in presenting inconsistencies within the 2001 amendments of the Property (Relationships) Act. = O v S = The O v S case presents a result in which a de facto relationship sees a seemingly more unfair order over property ownership. This case is commonly cited due to its example of de facto relationship status remaining inconsistent with the 2001 Amendment Act's core policy. The O and S parties maintained a de facto relationship for 10 years prior to separation. The related trust was discovered as an alter-ego and therefore justified a trust claim of $75,000; the judge however ordered in favour of the Property (Relationships) Act. Though there was an attempt to defeat rights under s44, property was received by the second respondents under good faith. Compensation was still ordered however, the judge allowed the husband the ability to raise the funds on the basis of past business evidence. Thus, the wife would have to wait for redress on the husband's terms despite other income and trust sources. Had O and S been married, this outcome would have likely presented different results. This case has led to much criticism regarding the status and definition of trusts in New Zealand legislation, citing in-coherency of definition.  Future Propositions  A call for a modern-approach has been increasingly active to reform current relationship legislation. increasing criticism has paved further discussion regarding future amendments to the act. This includes the addition of definitions relating to UN-specified trusts, native land entitlements and further clarification of legislative definitions. Other propositions include the further redefinition of relationships. The 2001 amendments aimed to re-address relationship standings within legislation, further specification has been cited as an area for redevelopment. The case of Ward V Ward brought a conceptual flaw to light regarding the amendment act's original policy of maintaining equal sharing in a relationship. The lack of specification regarding de facto relationships in this amendment has warranted lawmakers to suggest changes to amend this and further fulfil the act's core directive. The topic of immeasurable contributions within relationships has also maintained significant controversy under the 2001 amendment's re- definition. This has led for a call to update such definitions to add more specific terms for ease of property distribution. Domestic duties, child birth and child care are relationship contributions that cannot be divided upon separation and can therefore leave some individuals short-handed following separation or divorce. Future proposals have named the addition of these actions in a relationship to be included as part of a newly proposed amendment to further conceptual relationship equity post-separation as opposed to the current policy of equal sharing. The current status of equality within the 2001 amendment has left some individuals without an equal share of the relationship; as seen in the case of O v S. O v S and cases not too dissimilar have left a growing movement of proposal that is not un-welcomed by New Zealand legislators, and is therefore not unlikely to have observed changes and additions made in future.

It is the deadliest train accident in Taiwan since 1900.  Incident  At about 16:00 (UTC+8), EMU100 series Tze- Chiang (T.C) 1006 Train and Chu-Kuang (C.K) 1 Train collided. Chu-Kuang 1 was turning into the centre of the secondary line but Tze-Chiang 1006 lost its control. The traffic light of K134 Station was green, so the driver of Tze- Chiang 1006 Train did not notice anything wrong. When he noticed the unusual condition, it was too late. The first three carriages of Tze-Chiang 1006 crushed to the antepenultimate carriage of Chu-Kuang 1 and all of the six carriages turned over onto the ground. The accident caused 30 deaths and 112 injuries. Tze-Chiang 40ED102„ÄÅ40ET101 and Chu-Kuang 35FPK10207„ÄÅ35FPK10209 were all scrapped. There were many Japanese passengers among the casualty, including Congressman Hideaki Oshiro (Â§ßÂüéÁßÄÊò≠).  Investigation  The reason for this accident was because of the Automatic train stop (ATS). It is a system that helps to train to stop when the emergency happens which to help to prevent train accidents. The ATS of the Tze-Chiang 1006 was not working, so it did not stop before crashed to the Chu-Kuang 1. Also, Taiwan Railway dispatched cranes and lifted the bogies, and at the same time investigated the cause of the accident from the mechanical parts of the signal, track conversion, and self-propelled operation or if there were some human factors. Taiwan Rail way also simulated and restored the train collision which saw the Tze-Chiang 1006 Train crushed to Chu-Kuang 1 Train and all three carriages of Chu-Kuang Train were all crushed heavily. Mr. Chen Shifang, the railroad chief who just took office four months ago, initially excluded the disabled part. He said:\\" There are no problems of signal. The collision was because the train did not slow down, all the responsibility were all on drivers.\\" The direction of the survey points to human error, and Huashi had an exclusive interview with the injured driver of Tze-Chiang. The automatic braking system was actually installed but had failed at that time, so it needs to be repaired in advance. The train driver felt wronged. The whole incident showed that the machine and human conditions were both fine. But injured people and the bereaved were all unsatisfied with this result, so the Taiwan Railway Administrator had to investigated faster. Finally, the result was because the ATS system had broken down. The driver and the railroad chief are all sentenced involuntary homicide.  Aftermath  After the accident, Premier of the Executive Yuan Hau Pei-tsun and Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government Lien Chan went to condoled and every passenger received NT$3 million as compensation. Chen Shifang and the Tze Chiang train driver Su Jinkun (ËòáÈáëÁÑú) were both prosecuted for professional negligence. Su was sent to jail for 4 years and Chen was acquitted.

There is limited scientific research on the effects of marijuana and sex, however, and it is not well understood. The lack of research is in part due to U.S. drug policies centered on prohibition. In addition, the effects are difficult to study because sexual arousal and functioning are in themselves extremely complex and differ among individuals. Moreover, marijuana affects people differently. As a result, it is challenging to study. Men and women report greater sexual pleasure after having consumed marijuana, but there is no direct scientific evidence of the effects on the physiological components of the sexual response cycle when using the drug. Research Research of the effects of marijuana and sex on humans is so far limited to self-report studies. This type of study has disadvantages because it requires people to accurately remember how much they consumed and its effects, while researchers have no way to verify responses. In these studies, the majority of men and women who consumed marijuana prior to sex reported they experienced greater pleasure than without it. Researchers believe this reported increase in sexual pleasure with marijuana is likely a result of the drug‚Äôs effects on the senses. In particular, it commonly makes users feel more relaxed. There is some research that suggests the amount of marijuana consumed affects the experience. In one study, 59% of users thought that sexual pleasure was enhanced after smoking one joint. Less than half (39%), however, thought that consuming more than one joint provided further enhancement. In addition, large doses of marijuana have been used as a sexual depressant in India. It is not clear if marijuana consumption affects the quality of orgasms. Just over half of male consumers and a lower percentage of female consumers reported that it enhanced their orgasms. In a small study published in 1979 of 84 graduate students, the majority of which were men, those who reported being ‚Äúexperienced smokers‚Äù believed that it increased the intensity of an orgasm and should be considered an aphrodisiac. A number of more recent studies do suggest orgasms are improved with marijuana use, however. Studies on marijuana consumption‚Äôs effects on sex have shown little other significant physical improvements. Masters and Johnson completed a five year long study in 1979, with a sample size of 800 men and 500 women whose ages ranged between 18 and 30 years old. In this study, men reported no improvements in maintaining erections or an increase of penile firmness. Women reported no increase of vaginal lubrication. A more recent study in 2017 in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, looked at data from the large nationally representative National Survey of Family Growth and included more than 28,000 women and nearly 23,000 men. It reviewed survey responses on how frequently they had consumed marijuana and had sex in the four weeks prior to the survey. It found that women who consumed cannabis daily had an average of 7.1 sexual encounters in the previous four weeks compared to 6 for those who never consumed it. Men who consumed marijuana daily reported having sex 6.9 times on average compared to 5.6 times in those men who never consumed it. There has also been some evidence of negative effects on marijuana use on sex. Some studies show a correlation between chronic marijuana use and reduced testosterone levels in men. Furthermore, it has been found that heavy use of marijuana decreases the sperm count of healthy men. This reduction in sperm count can be reversed. Chronic use of marijuana is also linked to a decrease in sexual performance, while increasing sexual arousal. Products There are a variety of cannabis- infused sex products, such as lubricants and massage oils containing CBD and THC.

Eskind Biomedical Library Special Collections, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.. Franklin Church Bing was a nutritionist, scientist and a chemist and he had studied and made many contributions to these related fields during his whole life. TOC  Early life and education  =Early life and family (1902-1919)= Franklin Church Bing was born in 1902 by his mother Alice Church in North Wales, Pennsylvania, America. She was a mixture of Scottish and French. His father was Franklin Howard Bing and he was a craftsman who made Musical Instruments. Then Franklin Church Bing grew up around Philadelphia and he had four younger brothers. He studied in a senior high school in Philadelphia, Frankford area. In high school, he was inspired by his science curriculum to pursue a later scientific career. Franklin Church Bing studied chemistry in the Yale University to got his PhD until 1930. In that period, he met his wife Catherine Payne. She was a pediatric nurse working at Grace New Haven Hospital. Then they fell in love and married and after a few years, they had a child, named as John Howard. During the time he met and lived with his wife, he wrote many poems for her. =Education= alt= Pfahler Hall of Science Ursinus College alt= After graduating from the high school, Franklin Church Bing studied in the Ursinus College during 1920. Then he left the Ursinus College after 1 year's study and then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania to study biology and chemistry in 1921Bing, F. C. (1980) Oral History. M. Balsley, interviewer. Bing Papers Box 9: Archives of the Vanderbilt Medical Center Library, Nashville, TN.. In 1924, he earned his bachelor's degree of the University of Pennsylvania. After that, he had been a biology and chemistry teacher for a year at the Davis and Elkins College. Then he studied chemistry in the physiological chemistry department of Yale University and got his PhD of this major in 1930. In 1928, he studied at the Yale University and published his first history essay in the University in the 'Scientific Monthly'. The journal article introduced an early American scientist-John Lining. He did many experiments on metabolism and he had his own viewpoints on epidemics. In order to improve his academic background in physiological chemistry, he attended a summer course in physiology at the Woods Hole University. During the summer camp, he met and lived with Eugene Markley Landis, an upperclassman. Eugene became one of Franklin Church Bing's friends and taught Bing to be persistent in his academic researchBing, F. C. (1979) Letter to D. Bearman. Bing Papers Box 9: Archives of the Vanderbilt Medical Center Library, Nashville, TN.  Work experience  American Medical Association HQ During the time he was writing dissertation to get the PhD, he became a faculty member in the apartment of Biochemistry in the Western Reserve University between 1929 and 1936. During that period, his students and he published approximately 15 scientific and chemical articles.. After many years of studying, in Bing's later career, he joined the American Medical Association and became one of the scientific researchers from 1936. At the same time, he expected to continue his academic research and teaching thus he became a teacher and researcher at the Northwest University between 1936 and 1952. From 1950 to 1952, he worked as an advisor to the Delaney Committee of the United States House of Representatives. He has made many contributions to the Delaney Committee over the next two years, such as preparing background papers for members of the Committee and attending hearings and preparing abstracts for the technical part of the meeting. In 1949, he gave up the job of the advisor and he started a consulting company of his own in Chicago. With his years of experience in nutrition and biochemistry, he has taken care of the company for more than 20 yearsBing, F. C. (1950) Diary for the year 1950. Bing Papers Box 7: Archives of the Vanderbilt Medical Center Library, Nashville, TN.. In 1967, Bing wrote a biographical sketch for Lydia Jane Roberts (June 30, 1879 ‚Äì May 28, 1965) who contributing in the aspects of nutriology and biochemistry and published in The Journal of Nutrition. Since then, he has become an independent food and drug advisor for private businesses and government agencies. In 1973, Bing wrote a biographical sketch for Friedrich Bidder (1810‚Äì1894) and Carl Schmidt (1822‚Äì1894) who contributing in nutriology and biochemistry and published in The Journal of Nutrition. In 1985, Franklin Church Bing became an archivist and worked for the American Institute of Nutrition. Then he and his wife moved to Upper Sandusky to stayed with their child. After he retired in 1988 and they lived in a nursing home until 1988. In October 1988, he died of a brain hemorrhage  Contribution to nutriology  In 1932, W. Lloyd Adams Russel O. Bowman and Bing published an article, which called 'The Protein Requirements of the Albino Mouse'. They considered the relationship between the protein casein levels and the weight gained of mice. These healthy mice were fed special diets containing 0.95, 1.96, 4.0, 7.8, 15.6, 23.2 and 49.7 percent protein casein levels of their total calories, respectively. The researchers measured the changes in food intake and the weight in mice for three to seven weeks. The mice ate 0.95 percent casein lost weight, those ate 1.96 percent stayed the same and the mice ate 4 percent lost weight rapidly. The result was that a diet containing 15.6 percent casein certainly met the mice's protein needs. At the same time, metabolic differences became apparent when weight gaining per gram of protein ingested. From 1935, Franklin Church Bing and his team had launched many nutrition education campaigns. Under Bing's guidance, a large number of articles had been published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Those articles described the latest information about vitamins and the articles attracted and helped many scholars and professionals. Then the articles were written into an influential bookAmerican Medical Association (1939) The Vitamins American Medical Association Chicago, IL.. In addition, Bing constant research in nutrition has aroused his interest in vitamins G. He did an experiment in which he changed the diet of some healthy mice and made their food lack of vitamin G. At the same time, he kept the other mice on a normal diet for a long period. Experiments showed that the neutral fat content was greatly reduced of these vitamin deficient mice and their bones developed at a slower rate than other normal mice. The final result of this experiment showed that Vitamin G is essential. In 1940, Alfred H. Free and Franklin C. Bing published an article in The Journal of Nutrition. The report recorded iron and ionogenic iron levels in wheat tested using a dipyridyl method. The result of this test showed that on average, 81% of the total iron contented in wheat is ionogenic iron. Bing's test reported that the range of ionogenic iron as a percentage of total iron was 73 to 88 percent. In this scale, the percentage of ionogenic iron in the total iron was the same. In 1954, Bing and his team published an article called 'Some New Questions Relating to Chemicals in Foods' in 'American Journal of Public Health and the Nations Health'. This article summed up many nutriology and chemical opinions of different experts and professors from those years. In 1956, Harold R. Sandstead, F. C. Blanck, Bernard L. Oser, Bernard E. Procter, Glenn G. Slocum and Franklin C. Bing wrote and published an article in Chemical committee on food and nutrition. They suggested that the use of food additives should be more strictly regulated and should cared more about human health. In 1976, Franklin Church Bing wrote and published an article called 'Nutrition research and education in the Age of Franklin. A Bicentennial study' in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. He documented two hundred years of advances in nutrition and science. In addition, this journal article showed the contributions of many experimental scientists and nutritionists, such as Lavoisier, Count Rumford, and Benjamin Franklin. Their works and experiences laid the foundation for 200 years of progress in scientific knowledge.  Contribution to medicine  During the period when Franklin Church Bing studied in Yale University, he made a large number of notes and considered about a historical medicine ‚Äì ‚Äòmetabolism‚Äô from himself and the field of nutriology from himself and his teacher ‚Äì Professor Lafayette B. Mendel in past years. His new views of ‚Äòmetabolism‚Äô attracted and helped many scholars and professionals. The Professor Lafayette B. Mendel was the head of Physiology and Physiologic Chemistry in Yale University. In addition, Bing worked for American Institute of Baking in Chicago from 1943 to 1950. During that period, some researchers and he conducted a survey of placebos and vitamin in a steel mill. They expected to consider if the effects of placebos and vitamin on factory output and workers' morale would be different thus his team and he picked up one group of workers to do this research. Bing gave the group of workers a vitamin supplement for the first time, a placebo for the second, and no supplements for the last time. They took a long period to come to a result due to a large workload and variables of this experiment. As a result, they considered that placebos and vitamins did not make much difference in boosting workers' morale and the output of the factory. In 1971, Bing published an article on the website - JAMA Network named 'Vitamin C and the Common Cold'. This article argued that Professor Linus Pauling's suggestion that ascorbic acid could be an effective treatment for the common cold. Bing considered that ascorbic acid was not a completely harmless chemical to treat the common cold. In addition, Bing believed that when Professor Linus Pauling used ascorbic acid, it did not prove the safety of all drugs and it meant that the use of ascorbic acid remained controversial. Actually, Bing proposed a possibility to treat the common cold - vitamins.  Contribution to biological chemistry  Hemoglobin During Franklin Church Bing's time as a faculty in the department of Biochemistry in the Western Reserve University, Heinle and Bing developed a new approach to measure the number of red blood cells and the concentration of hemoglobin in 1933 and this measurement was more accurate than previous method and it may has certain application value in small animal research. In 1934, Bing did an experiment with a group of anaemic mice and a group of normal mice to measure their levels of copper and iron. The result of this experiment presented that the significant intraperitoneal advantage over oral iron may be due to the retention of copper. The rapid reconstruction of hemoglobin reflected the improvement of copper utilization rate. In addition, he did a chemistry experiment on anaemic mice and bread. He fed a group of mice bread which containing iron and copper elements for a long period. At the same time, he kept the other mice on a normal diet. The result of this chemistry experiment showed that hemoglobin could be grown and regenerated by both iron and copper elements in bread . In 1940, the JAMA Network published an article on lead and food safety. This report was an experimental study supported by the American Medical Association. Bing and other researchers conducted a number of experimental studies that provided that most of the large amounts of food they tested before, contained trace amounts of lead. Studies showed that these trace amounts of lead could be dangerous to humans over time. According to existing studies and researches, The Council on Foods had repeatedly highlighted the dangers of lead to humans and increased efforts to improve food safety from lead contamination.

History  = 1910‚Äì1926 = Employers Mutual Limited is a combination of three associations which are formed in the early 20th century. 255x255pxMaster Bakers Association is a prospered bread company which established in 1881. On the celebration of the third anniversary of the formation of this company, managers of this company started to realise the importance of workers' rights and living standard. Great Southern Bakeries is one of the large baking business in the early 20th century in Australia. After realising that the requirement of providing compensation to workers who get injured while working, Great Southern Bakeries and the Master Bakers Association set up the Master Baker's Mutual Indemnity Association Ltd, which was registered in Sydney, New South Wales as a limited company in 1910. According to Employers Mutual Limited (2019), with five employees, the Master Bakers Association provides compensation services to workers in baking, plumbing and transport industries in New South Wales at that time. This organisation established the first compensation act which affects the state at that time. In 1911, the Master Bakers' Mutual Indemnity Association Ltd guaranteed to protect workers' right by assisting individuals to against claim and demands in respect of accidents to workers This concept of insurance and compensation gradually separated into other industries at that time. Limited by guarantee, the Plumbers‚Äô Mutual Indemnity Association was registered in 1912 with the core service of resulting in injury to employees and help workers to reduce their losses when get injured from work. The head office of the Plumbers‚Äô Mutual Indemnity Association was set in Sydney. The Master Carriers‚Äô Mutual Indemnity Association was established in 1914. In June 1926, a subjoined special resolution was passed by the Master Plumbers‚Äô Mutual Indemnity Association, as their asset might be handed over to the Master Carriers‚Äô Mutual Indemnity Association, and in return Master Carriers‚Äô Mutual Indemnity Association will accept membership from the Master Plumbers‚Äô Mutual Indemnity Association. Together with the Master Baker's Mutual Indemnity Association Ltd, these three association that has been acting independently but in similar lines for several years merged to become the Employers Mutual Limited in 1926, which is a combination of interest of this three large workers' compensation company. At that time, Employers Mutual Limited was estimated to own an initial membership of 500 to 600 in total, and approximately ¬£40,000 revenue in the first year. = 1987‚Äì2003 = After Employers Mutual Limited was established, the company enlarged and expanded its business throughout the following decades. In 1987, the company became an agent of the WorkerCover( now named icare workers insurance) in New South Wales, with a license to manage workers compensation claims.303x303px Aiming at providing workplace compensation and health insurance to mining workers, Employers Mutual Limited established Coal Services Pty Limited in 2001. By establishing this organisation, the company expands its services into the Coal mining industry in New South Wales.

As one of the service providers for icare, Employed Mutual Limited provides compensation service and other specialist support including Ministry of Health (South), Police and Emergency Services, Planning and Premier and Cabinet for government departments employees and workers who get injured from work. In 2006, there were around 540 employees worked in the company and the company was appointed by WorkCoverSA (now named ReturnToWorkSA) as the sole management agent for workers in New South Wales. The aim of WorkCoverSA is to provide insurance and compensation services for workers in South Australia who get injured when they are working. Employers need to pay an annual insurance premium for employees. As for a case manage agency, EML provides face to face services for workers when they are injured because of their work and also provide services such as financial support and medical health care support to assist workers to get back to the workplace. In 2008, the company expands its service into the hotel industry in New South Wales. Teamed up with the Australian Hotels Association (NSW) and Clubs NSW, this company established Hospitality Employers Mutual Limited (Hospitality) to provide compensation insurance and compensation scheme service to workers within the hotel industry in New South Wales. = 2012‚Äì2018 = The company further increased its service range in the hospitality industry by cooperating with Clubs NSW to formed the Club Employers Mutual in 2012.

Career  Gelle was born in Szombathely, Hungary. She lived and worked in Asia for several years. After graduating in History and Cultural Management at BDTF College, Szombathely in 1990, and in Tibetan Studies at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University (ELTE), Budapest in 1995, she worked as an office manager at Tibet House Foundation, and as a lecturer at ELTE University and Dharma Gate Buddhist College. She did her colloquial Tibetan Studies in Darjeeling at the Manjushree Institute in 2005-2006, and was a member of the Doctoral College for Himalayan Cultural Transfer and Cross-Contacts in the Himalayan Borderlands at the University of Vienna between 2011 and 2014. She worked as a Khyentse Fellow at ELTE University, Budapest at the Institute of Far Eastern Studies between 2014-2016. She taught the following subjects: Tibetan literature, Tibetan canonical literature, Tibetan religion in practice, Civilized Shamans, sacred space and pilgrimage, and sacred places of Buddhism. Among her responsibilities was to organize lectures and conferences about Buddhism, to invite foreign scholars and promote research on Buddhism. She has a broad interest in the field of Tibetan and Buddhist studies, Himalayan religious practices, rituals, ritual texts, mountain cult, pilgrimage, and Asian performing arts. Her main areas of interest are the teaching lineages of the Nyingma school, gter ma tradition, Himalayan hidden lands (beyul), Buddhist eschatology, and Hyolmo tradition. Between 1999 and 2003 she worked with some of the last Tibetan storytellers in India, Mani Lamas, who used to recite stories with painted scrolls to spread the teaching of compassion and popularize the Chenrezi cult, and the use of its mantra, Om mani padme hum. Gelle traveled widely in India to find traces of this storytelling tradition, and meet its representatives, the buchens of Spiti; Buchen Gyurme, one of the last active mani lamas living in Dekyiling that time; and Buchen Norgye in Kollegal, South India. She was one of the main contributors of the exhibition \\"Demons and Protectors\\" organized by the Ferenc Hopp Museum of Eastern Asiatic Arts in 2003. Her other major project started in 2011, when she became a member of the Doctoral College for Himalayan Cultural Transfer and Cross-Contacts on the Himalayan Borderlands at the University of Vienna, Austria to conduct research on Hyolmo history and tradition. When the earthquake hit Nepal in 2015, most of the Hyolmo villages were destroyed, and she started the Hyolmo Heritage Project to preserve Hyolmo tradition and create a platform where memories can be shared. Presently, she is working as a freelance translator and independent researcher, writing contributions for museum catalogues, project publications and conference proceedings.

Extreme Characters (also known as brink users and extreme users) is a methodology used within user-centered design in order to represent edge case users of a product, brand or user interface. Extreme Characters also fits under the umbrella of market segmentation within marketing as it formulates design solutions for both average users and extreme, brink users. The concept of creating extreme users has been adopted heavily into the concept user- centered design and human-centered computing, and has led to its wide adoption both within online and offline applications, along with its placement within marketing communications. Extreme characters is based within designing for the brink users for a product, this behaviour is cultivated through the collection of data through focus groups and interviews with specific users. From this, a clear goal, or user need, is formulated. By designing for a user need that is only reflected by a minority of the focus group, the use-case of extreme users is born. Through designing for this minority, design solutions stem for both use brink users, and the average user. The concept of extreme characters has, however, come under scrutiny, leading to a critique of its placement within user-centered design and marketing. This scrutiny comes under the umbrella that it leads designers and marketers away from the target market for a specific product or service. Moreover, the critique also dictates that the methodology does not ultimately portray real end users of a specific product or service. Through the use of extreme users, designers are able to characterise and formulate their products needs to fit around the extreme users differing contexts. By observing these work arounds the extreme users use, it allows for the designer to not only form a product for the general population, but for also these brink users. Finally, the influence of extreme characters can be seen to have formed landmark technologies. This can clearly be seen with J. Djajadiningrat's Interaction Relabelling and Extreme Characters referencing the creation of first telephone by Alexander Graham Bell and the creation of the first closed source email protocol within the year 1972 by Vint Cerf. It also has a large play in modernistic technology and its overall design. This can be seen with the creation of the Nintendo Wii and the redesign of the Ford Focus.  History  Vint Cerf (right) pictured in 2007 The earliest study that coined the name 'extreme characters/extreme users' for this approach was J. Djajadiningrat's Interaction Relabelling and Extreme Characters. It is here that the concept of using brink users for the exploration of unexplored use cases for a product or service. However, the concept of using extreme characters in the user experience of product or services can be dated back to the 19th century. This can be seen with through Vint Cerf's exploration into programming a closed source email protocol within the year 1972. From his programming, he communicated that through the capability for electronic letters within a closed network, he was inherently able to talk to his deaf wife whilst they were both at work. Moreover, another known landmark use of this design methodology before the cultivation of its academic recognition within the aforementioned J. Djajadiningrat's study, was Alexander Graham Bell's work with the deaf formulating in his patient for the first telephone Alexander Graham Bell ((booklet)). Halifax, Nova Scotia: Maritime Telegraph & Telephone Limited. 1979. p. 8.. Through designing for patient with hearing difficulties, a user that is not inherently the 'generic user', Bell's work cultivated in one of the biggest telecommunication leaps in the modern age. = J. Djajadiningrat's study = The first academic recognition of extreme users can be seen within Interaction Relabelling and Extreme Characters: Methods for Exploring Aesthetic Interactions. Through its citing of specific studies in the use-cases of personas, it brings to fruition how many studies had been citing the use of extreme characters within their product design without realising its academic potential. J. Djajadiningrat depicts this in judgement of Actors, Hairdos and Videotapes - Informance Design. which was already using extreme characters before the technique was coined. They used it in this design in order to steer away the product design away from the characters within a specific target group. He judges how through their accidental use of three extreme personas, a drug dealer, the Pope and a woman with two husbands. Following this, Djajadiningrat judged the development of each character in order to analyse the creation of specific products that helped their contexts. For the Pope, it was a product that gave status, for the drug dealer it was a product that highlighted secrecy and finally for the polyandrous wife, it created a product that designed a management system Thereby, by J. Djajadingrat's study, the first academic recognition of extreme users formed the academic advantage of how the methodology can expose emotions and traits that are not obvious for standard user's scenario. Moreover, by utilising this technique, J Djajadiningrat argues that allows for designers to make more humane and human centric products and services.  Benefits  In accordance with Martin Tomitsch, a lead user experience designer at the University of Sydney, the concept of \\"extreme characters\\" stems from the design process as it installs a consideration for the users outside of the typical and generic user base of a product or service. It can, thereby, provide a compelling design solution and focus in on constructing abstract data, that is received through user testing, into a complete design solution for the non stereotypical type of user of a product or service. It is often used in the early stages of the design, according to Tomitsch, as it allows for the User Experience Designer to generate new problem aspects of the design, and, in hand, promote new elements and aspects of the design concept. Following this, representation of the 'extreme users', through other various User Experience methodologies, such as bodystorming or role playing into these type of characters, it can thereby promote a bigger picture of this character profile that the design team can manufacture and ideate a product or service towards. As dictated by the Harvard Business School, an exploration of extreme users can be ventured into through several approaches. The analysis of representing extreme characters through personas is one approach, as dictated through Martin Tomitsch's study, however benefits can also present themselves if the extreme consumer is donned by the very designers. This can be seen with studies, such as the redesign of the Ford Focus, that showed the benefits of the methodology by the engineers physically becoming these extreme consumers.  Acclaimed usages of the methodology  = August de los Reyes = Global recognition, within the user experience community, of this methodology resounded with the appearance of the 'extreme user' approach by August de los Reyes, a lead designer for the Xbox One. This occurred due to his recent wheelchair bound state, resulting in him creating a design for the video game console that could be accessed by the non-conventional user of the device, individuals who are wheelchair bound. = Chris Messina and Twitter's hashtags = Moreover, often cited as the \\"father of the hashtag\\", Chris Messina proposed, a tweet in 2007, the concept of having a metadata tag to group specific events that could generated by users on the social media platform Twitter in order to create order to constant streams of tweets. It would thereby, also, allow users to find similar messages and people who are also reacting and replying to this specific theme or event. Twitters initial response to this proposition by Messina was quoted to be \\"these things are for nerds\\". However, through extreme users of the Twitter platform, as seen with the fire that ravished through San Diego within 2007 saw the first \\"social trend\\" of a hashtag. The hashtag \\"#sandiegofire\\" allowed users to gain easily updates on the fire location and track constant news outlets. Through this, the benefits were saw by the Twitter platform itself and was quickly implemented by the platform. Using the hashtag has become prominent on the internet and, as calculated in 2018, 85% of websites that can be found in the top 50 websites (as based by traffic) use the hashtag. as a way for users to be able to group metadata and content under a specific hashtag. This use of extreme users adopting this service, proposed by Messina, promoted this thinking of designing for use cases for individuals effected by events like the 2007 wildfires and how specific products will benefit them. = The Nintendo Wii = In accordance to the Harvard University Business School, the Nintendo Wii game console stemmed from Nintendo researching into the extreme users of the gaming market, people who hate playing games on gaming consoles . From this, apparent research took place and resulted in an array of information about the struggles of gaming for the \\"non-gamer\\". This included that, at the current gaming environment at the time before the launch of the Wii, consoles were too complicated and that the console controllers were too difficult to operate. In response, the Nintendo Wii was born. The controlled they designed was motion controlled which emulated all the real-life motions in order to counteract this difficulty for users with the original gaming controllers. Moreover, the system designed used easier to understand graphics to avoid the convoluted user interface. The Wii was a revolution and, through Nintendo's analysis of extreme users, it created this instant hit of a console. In all the Nintendo Wii is the fifth best selling game console ever put to market \\"Historical Data: Consolidated Sales Transition by Region\\" (xlsx). Nintendo. April 27, 2017. Archived from the original on October 26, 2017. Retrieved May 31st, 2019. and has forced the competition in the gaming market to follow suit with its motion controlled gestures that mimic real life.Pogue, David (November 4, 2010). \\"Kinect Pushes Users Into a Sweaty New Dimension\\". The New York Times. Retrieved May 31st, 2019 This is abundantly clear with the subsequent creations of the Xbox Kinect and the PlayStation Move. Both these products were made as a result of the design leap that the Wii took from its exploration within the extreme characters design methodology. = The Ford Focus redesign = The Ford team used the extreme user approach in their engineering of the Ford Focus. Through their approach of learning from an extreme demographic of the user of their car, the elderly with physical limitations, they were able to dictate the troublesome tasks for this age bracket. By observing this specific user in this demographic, it was clear that their physical constraints made it difficult for them to use different functionalities of the car, such as the seatbelt. Through using specific body suits that removed motion around the legs, arms and neck movements, with similar constraints put on for hearing and sight, the engineers became this extreme user. By the engineers becoming the user, they released how the different designs of the Focus forced difficulty for users with these physical limitations. Thereby, through this method of design, the end redesign of the car focused on this accessibility factor. It allowed for new features that promoted accessibility for not only this demographic, but provided important features for all consumers.  Critique and criticism  As dictated through Prof. Luciano Gualberto's research into user modelling through personas and extreme characters, the concept of using an extreme scenario for a user will, in hand, lead the user to situations that they can design for, but in reality, are viewed as redundant. As taken from his research User Modelling with Personas, he brings to light this concept of designing for an extreme user, a drug dealer, who could use a specific service to hide a 'secret agenda', in this case it would be hiding an organised crime syndicate. However, Gualberto argues that the senior, generic user, will not need the same complexity of secrecy which, in hand, formulates this concept of \\"feature overload\\" - where the resources available clutter the real, usable data on the interface of the product or service. Gualberto's concluding critique of the methodology formulates the concept that the extreme user does lead to new design and user requirements, however, the difficulty of recognising of the important user needs within the user experience process as a whole can stem from the extreme user approach. Moreover, the method does not depict the real user need of the system, product or service and, in hand, the methodology does not argue for much creation time during the design process.

It is usually a last- resort treatment for severe aggressive behavioral disorders and similar behaviors including hyperexcitability, violent outbursts, and self-mutilation. The practice of medical amygdalotomy typically involves the administration of general anesthesia and is achieved through the application of cranial stereotactic surgery to target regions of the amygdala for surgical destruction. While some studies have found stereotactic amygdalotomy in humans to be an effective treatment for severe cases of intractable aggressive behavior that has not responded to standard treatment methods, other studies remain inconclusive. In most cases of amygdalotomy in humans, there is no substantial evidence of impairment in overall cognitive function, including intelligence and working memory, however, deficits in specific areas of memory have been noted pertaining to the recognition and emotional interpretation of facial stimuli. This is because there are specialized cells in the amygdala which attend to facial stimuli. Background The amygdala is considered to be an important underlying structure in the fight-or-flight response, playing a mediating role in aggression in both humans and animals. Clinical studies have revealed that the stimulation of the amygdala produces rageful behavior and or accentuates in animals. Research has also revealed that lesions of the amygdala in both humans and animals produces a calming effect on aggressive behavior. Based on these findings, amygdalotomy was developed as a neurosurgical procedure to ameliorate aggression by reducing arousal levels in the amygdala. The location of the amygdala in the human brain  Medical use  Since the early 1900s there has been an accumulation of experimental evidence to demonstrate the role of the limbic system, specifically the amygdala complex in mediating emotional expressions of fear and anger. Early primate studies have revealed that chemical and electrical stimulation of the amygdala region accentuates aggressive behavior. Conversely, destruction of the amygdala nucleus results in a taming effect of normal anger and fearing responses in primate behavior. Similarly, clinical studies in humans have revealed the close etiological role of temporal lobe structures, particularly the limbic system and the amygdala in mediating fear and rageful behavior. These findings have been instrumental in the development of clinical amygdalotomy as a form of neurosurgery to produce placating effects on abnormal aggressive behaviors. Procedural amygdalotomy is used as a last recourse treatment for severe intractable aggression when other options including pharmacological treatments have been exhausted. The psychopathology of patients with severe aggressive behavior in clinical cases of amygdalotomy over the past 20th century vary, including epileptics with violent convulsions, psychotics with violent outbursts, individuals with unmanageable conduct disorder, and patients with self-mutilative tendencies. The clinical practice of amygdalotomy in humans is commonly implemented under the stereotactic frame, with varying techniques used to destroy the amygdala, ranging from radiofrequency, mechanical destruction and the injection of oil, wax, and alcohol. The preferred target zone of the amygdala also varies from basal and lateral nuclei, to the medial region, the cortico-medial group of nuclei and the bed of the stria terminalis. The size of the lesion differs from one-third to one-half, to three-quarters, to the entire amygdalar region. In spite of these methodological differences, most published accounts of human amygdalotomy have indicated beneficial outcomes in reducing the intensity and frequency of aggressive behaviors.  Historical evolution  = Animal studies = Amongst some of the earliest studies conducted on the removal of the amygdala were animal and primate studies. In the early 1890s, Friedrich Goltz conducted experiments on temporal lobectomy in dogs including the removal of the amygdala and found that dogs post-surgery experienced a taming effects on aggressive behaviors. Deep brain stimulation studies in animals revealed that the temporal lobe is involved in mediating expressions of rage and aggression. A more detailed analysis of specific regions of the temporal lobe in animals revealed that the limbic system, specifically the amygdala complex, is involved in mediating fear and aggression. Some of the earliest primate studies on amygdalotomy were carried out on rhesus monkeys by Kluver and Bucy in the late 1930s. Data collected from these studies revealed that bilateral destruction of the amygdala resulted in a reduction in the intensity and frequency of fear and aggression behaviors. = Clinical trials = The stereotaxic apparatus used for clinical amygdalotomy The human counterpart of the role of the amygdala was then observed in the 20th century at the height of psychosurgery. Professor Hirotaro Narabayashi and his colleagues were the first researchers to carry out stereotactic amygdalotomy for the treatment of abnormal aggression and hyperexcitability in a series of 60 patients with psychological disturbances. The procedure was performed under a stereotactic frame devised by Professor Narabayashi and involved the administration 0.6-0.8ml mixture of oil-wax to destroy the lateral groups of the amygdala nucleus, localized via pneumoencephalography. The clinical results revealed a marked reduction in emotional disturbances amongst 85% of the cases. Following Narabayashi's study, there have been over 1000 cases of amygdalotomy reported in clinical trials as a last-resort treatment for severe intractable aggressive disorders. Around the same time, Hatai Chitanondh utilized a slightly different technique of stereotactic amygdalotomy using an injection of an olive oil mixture to induce lesions to mechanically block signals in the amygdala. The results revealed an improvement in social adaptability of all seven patients. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Balasubramaniam and Ramamurthi investigated the largest clinical patient series to undergo stereotactic amygdalotomy for aggression behaviours. The procedure was performed via high- frequency current generating electrodes inserted stereotactically to induce several small thermal lesions, creating a total lesion volume of 1800mm, a size that is larger than the amygdala. The improvement in maladaptive behavior in patients, including hyperexcitability, rebellious behavior, and destructive behavior, ranged from moderate to high. The development of MRI technology in the recent 20th century has enabled a more accurate and efficient process of amygdalotomy, with easier localization of amygdala regions during neuro- navigation as well as the use of advanced radiofrequency generating electrode to induce surgical lesions. Despite these recent advances in technology, there has been a decline in clinical cases of amygdalotomy for treatment of maladaptive behavior, with growing skepticism in the medical community of the cost-benefits of the procedure and partly due to a greater reliance on pharmacological treatments  Clinical effectiveness of Amygdalotomy  = Short-term results = There has been a general consensus amongst many researchers on the general effectiveness of amygdalotomy in reducing aggression amongst patients with psychosis, violent epilepsy, and self- mutilative behavior. A diverse study on stereotactic amygdalotomy used to treat 25 patients primarily for aggressive behavior and violent epilepsy, found that behavioral abnormalities were completely eliminated in 2 of the 20 patients, with a significant improvement in another 9 of the 20 patients with aggressive behavior manifests. Convulsions were also eliminated in 4 of the 21 patients, whilst 12 of the patients experienced a significant decrease in the number of epileptic convulsions. Patient rehabilitation was also effective with 2 of the 12 patients committed to mental institutions being discharged, whilst 5 of 8 patients awaiting institutionalization were no longer being considered. A multi-disciplinary project carried out on amygdalotomy amongst epileptics with violent outbursts found that amygdalotomy showed promising results, with a decline in violent, aggressive and anti-social behavior as well as a reduction amongst patients and an improvement in the occupational functioning of some of the patients. The researchers, however, concluded that the results cannot be generalized to non-epileptics. Other studies conducted on patients with conduct disorder, personality disorder, self-mutilation, and schizophrenics with violent hallucinations found that these maladaptive behaviors also improved across these groups of patients. Using reliable and objective methods of evaluation, Heimburger and colleagues found that in patients who did not respond to non-surgical therapy, amygdalotomy was effective, with both conditions of uncontrolled conduct disorder and seizures seeming improved after surgery. Stereotaxic amygdalotomy conducted on 12 patients with schizophrenia and frequent self-mutilations found that, in 11 of the 12 patients, amygdalotomy resulted in elimination and or marked reduction of aggressive episodes. In two of patients with frequent self-mutilative episodes and reactive psychotic hallucinations, however, these symptoms disappeared only after an additional basofrontal tractotomy had been performed. = Long-term results = There is a dearth of long-term studies on the follow-up effects of clinical amygdalotomy in humans. Amongst the few follow-up studies, includes a research study which compared the results of clinical amygdalotomy in 58 patients pre and post-surgery over an average of 6 years using objective analysis such as psychiatric interviews, neuropsychological tests and EEG analysis and found no indication of worsening of symptoms. Additionally, the researchers found some evidence for the retention of positive outcomes in one-third of the patients, which were not limited to improvements in rageful behaviour but also included a decrease in the overall frequency of seizures. Another follow-up study by Professor Narabayashi and colleagues observed the clinical effects of amygdalotomy in 40 cases from 3 to 5 years and found 27 of the cases had continued a satisfactory improvement in calming and taming effects on what was previously uncontrollable aggression including destructive and violent behaviour.  Risks and side-effects  In most cases of amygdalotomy in humans, there is no substantial evidence of impairment in overall cognitive function, including intelligence and working memory. However, deficits in specific areas of memory have been noted, particularly areas of memory pertaining to the recognition and emotional interpretation of facial stimuli. These findings of face recognition impairment after amygdalotomy are of particular importance due to the neurophysiological data collected on the importance of cells in the amygdala that specifically attend to facial stimuli in both humans and primates. A detailed case study of a patient who had undergone a bilateral amygdalotomy found incidences where the patient showed poor learning of new faces and impaired recognition of familiar faces, particularly troubles with naming faces. Additionally the patient also revealed further deficits in the emotional processing of facial stimuli, demonstrating difficulty in identifying and matching a range of facial expressions. Another study of 15 patients showed no reduction in general intelligence, but there was a similar pattern of changes in attention and memory involving facial stimuli. This link between the amygdala and social disturbances pertaining to the processing of facial stimuli has been investigated as a possible side-effect of amygdalotomy in some patients  References  Neurosurgery Physical psychiatric treatments ","title":"Amygdalotomy"},{"id":"60613002","text":"303x303px Kokutairon and Pure Socialism (1906), otherwise known as , is a radical socialist treatise written by Kita Ikki in critique of the Japanese Meiji Government. Kita Ikki was a notable Japanese political intellectual in the late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century. His political views, commonly aligned with the ideology of Sh≈çwa Nationalism, reflect the widespread Japanese reaction against Meiji government and kokutairon ideology on which their society was based.  Historical background  In September 1905, Kita returned to Tokyo (from home city Sado) at the time of the Hibiya Riots, which protested the Treaty of Portsmouth. The treaty marked an end to the Russo-Japanese War and was externally negotiated by US President Theodore Roosevelt. It contained beneficial terms for Japan's imperialist policies. There was now an international recognition that Japan had influence and control over parts of Russian-dominated China and Korea. Yet activist groups considered these terms a humiliating failure and thus rioted. While Kita agreed with the protester‚Äôs aim to secure Japan‚Äôs increased international prestige, he disagreed with their values in the Kokutai; which Kita believed \\"was a tool in the hands of the genro.\\" 18 It was in these circumstances that Kita wrote his first book, Kokutairon and Pure Socialism. George Wilson summarises this context: \\"Kita wrote his first book against a background of widespread popular discontent over the outcome of the Russo-Japanese War.\\"Wilson, 16 The riots marked a rise in violent political uprisings in Japan, a trend that favoured Kita and his radical political ideology. Kokutairon was Kita's first politically-inspired book and therefore reflects his early political views and alignments. Danny Orbach contends the book reflects Kita's \\"socialist, secular and rational phase.\\" According to Oliviero Frattolillo, Kita was personally motivated to writing Kokutairon because of the uncritical mindset of his intellectual peers. Frattolillo claims, \\"Kita was particularly critical of the submissive attitude of certain intellectuals towards the system who obsequiously accepted the acquisition of new theories and new forms of knowledge from the west, translated and transplanted in Japan.\\" He therefore wishes to plainly critique the faults of his society and propose a socialist alternative.  Political ideology (Sh≈çwa nationalism)  Kita's contextualised political ideology is defined as Sh≈çwa statism, otherwise known as Japanese fascism or Sh≈çwa nationalism. It is a sector of fascism/socialism that was often ultra-nationalist and militaristic in nature. It is categorised as a political syncretism, a political alignment that combines sectors from both left and right-wing politics and thus defies a singular identification. Kita was considered one of the great Japanese thinkers and intellectuals in this movement. Kita often took a more socialist and progressive-economic approach than the majority of Sh≈çwa nationalists. Kita's Kokutairon was influenced by his lecturers Ukita Kazutami, Ariga Nagao and Abe Isoo at the Waseda University.Wilson, 18  Kita's argument  Kita's book is essentially a critique of the Meiji government and their interpretation and teaching of the 'kokutai\\". The kokutai is a concept of imperial sovereignty. During the Meiji period, the popular ideology of kokutairon was formed and disseminated throughout Japan via education reforms that taught constitution, civil codes and the sovereignty of the Emperor. It was this Meiji interpretation and propagation of kokutairon ideology that Kita challenged in his political treatise. Kita's main argument, according to George Wilson, was that socialism and kokutai (as Kita defined it, i.e. a legal social democracy) were one of the same. Danny Orbach contends that Kita's views were heavily influenced by Marxism. Kita makes a few key arguments which will be summarised below to encapsulate his main thesis, criticisms and plan for the reorganisation of Japan. = Biological evolution = Kita argues that social democracy was the next natural progression of ideology and political structure for Japan. Social democracy is defined by Kita as the means \\"of extending political power to all elements of the state... it asserts that sovereignty resides in the state (which is equivalent to society)\\".Ikki, Kita. \\"Kokutairon and Pure Socialism.\\" In Kita Ikki Chosakushu (Writings of Kita Ikki), edited by Kamishima Jiro, 1-435. Tokyo: Misuzu Shobo, 1959, 246 Kita radically proposes that this is the only ideology that will allow human society (merely one species within the animal kingdom) to prosper in the struggle for survival. Any other system, will result in our extinction. Kita claims that Japan was currently in a stage of political change in the evolution of socialism. Hiroshi Osedo identifies three distinct stages in Kita's history of Japan's social evolution. The first was a state run by the emperor, \\"the supreme organ\\" of the state.Osedo, Hiroshi. \\"The Political Thought of Kita Ikki: The Logical Link between His Critique of the National Polity and His Advocacy of War.\\" The University of British Columbia, 1973, 12. The second was a co-run emperor and Diet government. This second change was precipitated in the early nineteenth-century during the Samurai revolution, or Meiji restoration, where the Tokugawa Shogunate were overthrown and replaced by the new Meiji government. Before this, an aristocratic, hierarchical form of state existed, where power laid with the emperor and the shogun class. While this was an important and positive change for Japan, it was an inadequate development in Kita's perspective. The final, idealised form of state structure is described by Osedo: \\"Thirdly, there was the system in which the majority, declared equal to one another, constitute the supreme organ.\\"Ibid. The third stage of Japan's social evolution is described by Kita as the \\"citizen-state kokutai\\", described in the following section.Ikki, 247 = Citizen-state Kokutai = Kita claims that this stage should have been obtained in the social revolution of 1868, but misinterpretation halted 'positive' social change. Predominantly, Kita opposes the widely-held belief of the sacred-divine right of the emperor. Such an opinion dangerously placed him in constant opposition with the Meiji regime and its kokutairon ideology.Wilson, 27 Contrary to popular sentiment, Kita believed the emperor was not sovereign, only the state could be sovereign and therefore the emperor was merely an \\"organ of the state.\\"Ibid Kita states in kokutairon, \\"The emperor of Japan is an organ who began and continues to exist for purposes of the survival and evolution of the state.\\"Ikki, 425 This was the main drive of Kita's argument.Osedo, 10 Essentially, Kita believed that under the Meiji regime, the emperor held too much power and prestige in a society that distinguished themself as a democracy. Therefore, in a modern democratic society such as Japan, they could not retain the sovereignty of the emperor. Kita's definition of 'true' kokutairon ideology is neatly expressed in his book: > \\"The present kokutai is not that of the age in which the state existed for > the monarch's benefit, as his possession. It is the citizen-state Kokutai in > which the state is recognised as a legal person having actual human > character...It is socialism because sovereignty resides in the state, and it > is democracy because power rests with the people\\"Ikki, 247 = The problem of the economic class = Despite this ideal, Kita identified practical barriers to this structure's implementation in Japan. This was because Japan's economic situation and privileged economic elite class failed \\"to conform to its new citizen-state kokutai.\\"Wilson, 32 Kita's solution therefore was to \\"readjust the present economic structure, which conflicts with the legal ideal of the [Meiji restoration]... designate nationalisation of land and capital -- the economic aspect of socialism.\\"Ikki, 370-371 The economic and legal sectors of Meiji society were inherently contradictory - one clung to tradition and the other, social democracy. = International sovereignty = Kita's Kokutairon is not limited to domestic concerns. He is as much concerned with class-struggle in Japan as he is with state-struggle in the international community. Kita's socialist ideal for the international society is the formation of a \\"world federation\\". Such an establishment would have the authority to resolve international disputes and conflicts of interests. However this was only possible where one state had majority control. Therefore Kita was a big supporter of imperialism. He describes it as a \\"precondition of internationalism\\", eventually allowing the \\"liberty and equality of all states\\" under the world federation.Ikki, 434 Kita's support of imperialism as a means to obtain socialist political structures, put him in contention with other socialists of his day. Japanese socialists, often pacifist in nature, strongly opposed the increasingly imperialist endeavours of the Japanese State. Kita on the other hand, was a big supporter of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904.Wilson, 34 = Kita's proposed solution = Kita finishes his book with a proposal for the reorganisation of the state. The first step was to initiate an economic revolution, removing the \\"economic aristocrats\\" who halted change as they gripped to pre-revolution ideals of state. Furthermore, Kita's solution to class struggle would be to introduce universal suffrage and enforce a system of election for representatives in the Diet. Once domestic issues were resolved, then the state struggle of prestige and influence in the international community could be dealt with. Through a policy of imperialism, the socialist \\"world federation\\" could be established, ultimately a \\"socialist utopia.\\"Wilson, 36 In order to achieve this utopia, however, Japan must \\"tire endlessly.\\"Orbach, 348  Public reaction  Kita's book was rejected by almost every reputable publisher he approached. Many rejected due to the radical fascist ideology expressed, which directly opposed the ideology of their current government and thus endangered potential publishers.Osedo, 9 Others, such as the Heimin Shimbun, a socially inclined publishing house, rejected it on grounds of its sheer length (1000 pages).Tsuzuki, 250 Kita's uncle, Homma Kazumatsu, eventually printed 500 copies of the manuscript on May 9, 1906. However, the home ministry of the Meiji Government had banned and removed all copies of Kita's book within 10 days of its publication.Wilson, 18 Kita only managed to successfully republish parts of Kokutairon over his lifetime. It was only published in its entirety in 1959 by Mizusu Shobo.Wilson, 42 Despite its quick removal from the public domain, Kokutairon managed to illicit some response, though none in the way Kita envisaged. Chushichi Tsuzuki summarises the reaction: \\"His book was welcomed by advanced intellectuals of the day such as Katayama Sen, the prominent economist Fukuda Tokuzo, and Kawakami Hajime.\\" Tsuzuki, 251 Katayama Sen, as a pacifist socialist, disagreed with Kita's imperialist international approach, yet was otherwise impressed with his socialist perspectives, describing Kokutairon as \\"probably the greatest work among Japanese writings on socialism.\\"Katayama Sen, \\"Kokutairon oyobi junsei shakaishugi (Kita Terujiro fun no chojutsu o shokaisu)\\" Hikari (May 20, 1906),p. 6: included in Hikari, p104 It even illicited the support of prominent economic academics of his day (Fukuda Tokuzo and Kawakami Hajimie). These positive receptions were however halted by an awareness of the inevitable backlash from Meiji authorities, due to its provocative nature. In 1906 Kita was invited to the Kakumei Hyoronsha group (Revolutionary Review Society), a Japanese socialist group dedicated to encouraging social revolution in China.Tsuzuki, 250 Tsuzuki suggests that this was a reaction to Kokutairon's publication. Christopher Szpilman suggests that Kita had purposely filled Kokutairon with emotionally and politically provocative elements in order to evoke an extreme reaction. That it was a plot to gain the attention of Japanese authorities. He states, \\"Kita constantly had ensured the book would stir extreme emotions by deliberately filling it with insults against the imperial family and various prominent academics.‚Äù Szpilman then includes a recurrent phrase in Kita's book to justify his claim.Szpilman, 470 Kita often described the Japanese people as \\"idiots who had their skulls smashed in by the single phrase bans nikkei (the imperial line unbroken for ages immemorial)\\"Ikki, pp 220, 277, 308, 312 etc Kokutairon is now used as evidence for historical investigation of Kita Ikki and his changing political ideologies, evolution of Japanese fascist political thought and of public opinion toward Meiji government.

It allows for a quiz-style teaching and learning method based on technology, which can be used in schools and other educational institutions. Students can use Quizizz on any electronic devices with browse, like, laptops, iPads and smartphones. Quizizz can be used as a 'check' machine that reveals how the students know about the knowledge and teachers can use Quizizz to assign students some homework.  Overview of Educational Technology  There are many types of educational technology in the world, and many different branches. For example, E-learning, Web-based Learning, Digital Learning and so on, all of these methods are collectively as Distance learning. Classroom technology has become a necessary condition for conducting daily learning activities. Technological advances have made it possible to integrate into classroom activities, for example, to support group learning and refurbishment education. multidimensional education is a particular learning model where students can learn both in the classroom and at home. In class, time is spent on practice or one-on-one learning, when students back to home they can use other educational techniques, like Kahoots, Quizizz or any other Google Forms methods to Self-Diagnostics. The most important point is that use educational technology can improve and reform the way of students learn and benefit educators.  Description of Quizizz  280x280px Quizizz is the same educatinoal technique with Kahoots, but it still has some slight differences with Kahoot!, Kahoot is only used for real-time formative evaluation, testing, questionnaires, and discussions in the classroom. Quizizz clearly lists two different application modes. One is to form a formative evaluation in real-time in the classroom, and the other is to be arranged by the teacher to the student as an extracurricular assignment. 1038x1038pxSimultaneously, Kahoot must use the whole class together, even if one of the classmates answers the question, then the student needs to wait for rest of the students answer the question then enter the next topic. But Quizizz is different, students wait differently and can follow their own schedule. Another big difference between Quizizz and Kahoot is that Kahoot is a teacher-dominated guide that all the questions and answers only on teachers' devices, but Quizizz is more like a student-dominated guide that students can know the questions and answers on their own devices. This application is quite simple to use for students, students can sign up by using their Google account, then they can start to use Quizizz. For teachers, they are using in a simple way as well, after sign up just click the 'create a quiz' at the top of the page, then start to create the questions that relate to students' courses.  The development of Quizizz  Quizizz was founded by Antik Gupta and Deepak Joy Cheenath in 2015, and it started to use in a school in Bengaluru, India. Quizizz is a web 2.0 tool, it has built a learning stage for both pedagogies, learners and parents to help teachers and parents to check children's homework and exams and bring those tasks into a self-paced game. In August 2018, the CEO of Quizizz, Antik Gupta, held a conference. He stated that it has attained 10 million active users and they raised $3 million in funding, which is a milestone for those two founders of Quizizz. They are using fundings to support new creations that can help learners overcome specific standard requirements that gave from states, schools, parents or Education Bureau. In 2018, in the United States, nearly half of schools have been using Quizizz, and 500 million questions have answered in each month in 2018.  Current use of Quizizz  Quizizz can be used in any teaching and learning areas, a teacher uses Quizizz to link students' engagement of study in an accounting and business class in university, or teacher uses this online education app or students who are in a Spanish Language course 2. In an accounting and business class, using Quizizz is a better way to keep students are listening and avoid some students distracted. In 2017 a high school in New Mexico, Los Alamos Public Schools, a physic teacher said, he will recommend Quizizz to every teacher and his students said this app will put their personality, interest, and ability into study. A researcher from Rutgers University picked a group of students who are undergraduate and major in Mathematics. Mathematics is often viewed as a subject that uses the traditional method to teach in the past and now, but the researcher found that after those students learned from Quizizz and test from it, teachers said it decrease theirs' pressure of teaching preparation and students felt more flexible and interesting than before just use the traditional method.  Impacts of using educational technologies  = Advantages = Educational Technology can also be viewed as Gamification Technique, it is using the way of creating games into learning and teaching areas, so Kahoot, Socrative, iClicker and Quizizz both of them are examples of gamification technique. Educators are frequently using Quizizz in class to creating occasional test and it increases students' participation. There is research about how gamification technique can increase students' motivation and engagement in the classroom. The Polytechnic Muadzam Shah Pahang in Malaysia, students who are in Database Design subject are divided into two groups, one is using Quizizz throughout the whole semester, another group just use it in some particular events. The final observation shows that those students who use Quizizz over the semester are more engaged and motivated than those who are not. At the same time, some students are taking the initiative in reviewing the knowledge, because students want to be the best. They are aggressive and competitive, according to the research from Bina Nusantara University, researchers are only looking for the impacts in Computer science' students who are in undergraduate level. They definitely believe that educational technology, like Quizizz, which is a good way to keep students in motivated and students are able to increase their interest in learning and get better grades, but also there have some drawbacks of using Quizizz, which is students will become more individualism, they are not willing to help other students who are in trouble. Another case that use Quizizz is in Sultan Idris Education University Malysia, an Arabic Class. For non-native speaker Arabic is quite hard to learn, researchers use this method to test around 90 students in three sections, educators by using Quizizz to test students' measurement of the knowledge and enhance their interests of the new language during the period. According to the survey, educators found students are more voluntary to answer questions and pay more attention on the curriculum. = Disadvantages = The drawbacks addressed in this part is Quizizz can distract students when they are using Quizizz in class, the second one is this kind of e-learning based technique is not design the knowledge individually. According to Deci and Ryan, there have three key points underlie the Self Determination Theory, which are Competence, Autonomy and Relatedness. Quizizz does not deliver knowledge and assessments individually, at this point, it is a lack of consideration of personal needs and motivation. Also, it is hard to use Quizizz to set up the same complexity tasks for students. Pedagogies can use e-learning techniques to decrease their working pressure, but for students, they are in different levels of learning, they are hard to follow teachers' progress and make themselves feel more stress when they get low results than others. Most of educational techniques can only impart intellectual knowledge content. In primary school, there is not many courses and knowledge that students need to learn, what's more, is self-control or help students to cultivate interests in those course. For emotional aspects, such as emotion management, creativity training, etc., there are still examples of courses that need to be taught personally. And some courses such as art and crafts and sports are better to teach a person in person than those who rely on educational techniques. From recent educators' research, indeed, the learning materials are only available for those assessments which are already made by educators, even though the e-learning platform can increase the quality of education. Educational psychologists state that Quizizz is a type of Motiple Choices Questionnares (MCQs) platform to test how students know about knowledges. As mentioned before, Quizizz is an application that students use on a digital device, when students use it in class, it might break their attention and play with their phones when the teacher is talking if the high-tech method can be used in a well-developed environment, students are extremely self-controlled that might have changed in the future. At the same time, when students use Quizizz it decreases the interaction between their peers or instructors, students are only focused on the score did they get and lose the motivation on that course. The adequate competition can bring in some funs and learning motivation or intrinsic motivations for students, but excessive competition might harmful to students' mental development even learning interests. Quizizz is one of the technical methods that help learners to input knowledge, therefore it is unavoidable to have some downsides of learners' mental health. In recent research, online learning can't communicate and communicate with teachers better. It lacks face-to-face practical skills. The content of online learning tends to be self-interested. It is partially lacking in interpersonal communication. Usually, classroom learning makes some involuntary. Under the influence of a good learning atmosphere, the students, especially the young people, are not only logical but also mastered very quickly. They do not have to delay too much time by their own learning. Moreover, there is a greater lack of interactivity, and it is impossible to achieve interactive and interactive learning among students, and mastery will not be comprehensive. At the same time, online learning will only lead to serious distractions and even inertia for friends with poor self- control, which is more different from classroom learning. According to some surveys, among the age groups, the 12- to 30-year-olds have the highest Internet access rate, and are also most prone to depression and physical health. In fact, the negative impact of online learning on the mental health of young people has always been the focus of domestic and international scholars. If adolescent students use Web 2.0 tool to understand and interact with others, they are prone to lack of emotional communication between people, which may lead to alienation, indifference and abnormal mentality. In the group of network dependence and internet addiction, the incidence of frequent eye discomfort after Internet access was significantly higher than that of the normal group. The incidence of wrist discomfort was significantly higher than that of the normal group, and the incidence of frequent lumbar discomfort was significantly higher than that of the normal group. Related studies have also found that Internet addiction is more harmful to children than other age groups, because children are still growing up and developing, and indulging in electronic products for a long time, damage to the brain will be irreparable. And, it is particularly detrimental to the development of early childhood intelligence.
