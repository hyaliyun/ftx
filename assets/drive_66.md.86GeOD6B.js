He composed it in Leipzig for the second Sunday after Easter and first performed it on 15 April 1725.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in his second annual cycle in Leipzig for the second Sunday after Easter, called . The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, Christ as a model (), and from the Gospel of John, the Good Shepherd (). According to John Eliot Gardiner, the poet is likely the same as for two preceding cantatas, Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden, BWV 6, and Am Abend aber desselbigen Sabbats, BWV 42, before Christiana Mariana von Ziegler became the poet for the following cantatas of the period. The three cantata texts were probably written for Bach's first year in Leipzig, but postponed due to the workload of the first performance of the St John Passion that year. They are a sequence on themes from the Gospel of John. The poet opens the cantata with the beginning from the Gospel, verse 11. The second movement explains that being a Good Shepherd was realized in the Passion. The thought is commented by the first stanza of Cornelius Becker's hymn \\"\\" (1598), a paraphrase of Psalm 23. The poet refers In movement 4 to verse 12 of the Gospel, the contrast of the shepherd who is awake to watch over the sheep, whereas the hired servants sleep and neglect them. Movement 5 names love as the shepherd's motivation to care for the sheep. The cantata ends with the chorale \\"\\", the fourth stanza of Ernst Christoph Homberg's hymn \\"\\" (1658). Bach first performed the cantata on 15 April 1725.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir only in the chorale, two oboes, two violins, viola, violoncello piccolo and basso continuo. # Aria (bass): # Aria (alto): # Chorale (soprano): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Chorale (satb):  Music  In the first movement, the bass as the vox Christi sings \\"I am a good shepherd\\", framed by instrumental ritornellos. The motif on these words appears already four times in the ritornello. The movement is between aria and arioso, with the oboe as a concertante instrument in \\"a mood of tranquil seriousness\\". The alto aria is accompanied by an obbligato violoncello piccolo. The chorale stanza is sung by the soprano on the tune of \\"Allein Gott in der H√∂h sei Ehr\\" by Nikolaus Decius, with a slightly ornamented melody, whereas the two oboes play a theme in ritornellos which is derived from the first line of the tune. The only recitative is a miniature sermon, accompanied by the strings accenting phrases of the text. Movement 5 is the only movement in the cantata in pastorale rhythm. The strings, violins and viola's, play in unison, so in the low register. Thus the tenor voice frequently appears as the highest part, beginning with three times \\"\\" (look). Gardiner observes the similarity to an alto aria (movement 60) of the St Matthew Passion, , similarities in both the theme \\"pastoral love emanating from the cross\\", and the music, described as \\"rich, flowing melody and gently rocking rhythm\\". The closing chorale is a four-part setting.

The semantic similarity relationships of the SSN represent several of the general relationship types of the standard Semantic network, reducing the complexity of the (normally, very large) network for calculations of semantics. SSNs define relation types as templates (and taxonomy of relations) for semantic similarity attributes that are common to relations of the same type. SSN representation allows propagation algorithms to faster calculate semantic similarities, including stop conditions within a specified threshold. This reduces the computation time and power required for calculation. Implementations include genetic information handling.

Her novel Blue Willow, about the experiences of Janey Larkin, the ten-year-old daughter of a migrant farm worker in 1930s California, is a Newbery Honor book and Lewis Carroll Shelf Award winner. A librarian in Fresno, California, Gates lived and worked among the people described in her novels. She is also known for her collections of Greek mythology. Life Doris Gates was born on November 26, 1901, in Mountain View, California, the oldest daughter of Charles Obed and Bessie Louise (Jones) Gates. Her father was a small-town doctor; her mother had a BA from Milton College in classical studies. When she was seven they moved to Charles' parents' prune ranch outside San Jose. It was there, at the age of eight, that Doris began school. According to Gates, her childhood, \\"even for those times, was unusually happy.\\" She wrote about it in The Elderberry Bush. Later the Gates family moved to Los Gatos. After graduating from high school, Gates found work in a library and a grocery store. Her father then moved the family to Fresno, and in 1924 she enrolled in Fresno State Teachers College. Two years later Gates attended Los Angeles Library School. She then became the assistant in the children's department of the Fresno County Free Library. After one year Gates took a leave of absence to study library science at Western Reserve University, (now Case Western Reserve) in Cleveland. She returned to Fresno to work as the children's librarian at the Fresno County Library in central California from 1930 to 1940.Some sources give the dates as 1931-1940. While in Fresno, Gates had a radio program telling stories to children. She also visited the schools erected for the children of workers displaced by the Dust Bowl, telling stories and sharing books.Rehart, Catherine, The Valley's Legends and Legacies, Quill Driver Books, 1996, pg. 267; Budget constraints caused the library to cut back its hours, so Gates used her extra day off to begin writing.Silvey, Anita, (editor), Children's Books and Their Creators, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1995, pp 267; Her first published book, Sarah's Idea (1938), is about a girl who wants to buy a burro and helps with the harvest on her family's prune ranch to earn the money she needs. Two years later Blue Willow, a book about the daughter of a migrant farmer like those she worked with, appeared. Also in 1940, Gates began working for San Jose State College, teaching children's literature and storytelling.Hansen, Debra Gold, A Pioneering and Independent Spirit, Trafford Publishing, 2010, pg. 41; Gates was a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Southern California, Los Angeles; and the University of San Francisco. She also spoke around the country to groups of librarians and teachers. In the 1960s she worked for the textbook publishers Ginn and Company editing the Ginn Basic Readers, a series of reading textbooks for elementary schools.Chevalier, Tracy (editor), Twentieth- Century Children's Writers, St. James Press, 1989, pp. 378; Married and later divorced, she moved to Carmel, where she bought and rode horses. Several of her later books reflect this interest, including A Morgan for Melinda. In 1971 and 1972 Gates made two trips to Greece, in preparation for a series of books retelling Greek mythology. As she later said, \\"I had a storyteller's knowledge rather than a scholar's knowledge of the myths\\". In 1972 she published the first two in a series of books based on Greek myths. She returned to Greece in 1983. Doris Gates died in Carmel, California, on September 3, 1987.Some sources say Monterey, CA. The children's room at the Central Fresno Library has been named the Doris Gates Room in her honor. Gates' papers are held at the University of Oregon and the University of Minnesota. Influence Blue Willow was a ground-breaking children's novel. \\"Many consider Blue Willow to have been the first realistic, problem novel for children, and it was recognized both for its lasting literary merit and for its expansion of the range of subjects which could be explored in books for children.\\" Children's literature expert Anita Silvey says its realistic handling of modern social issues is a \\"significant contribution to children's literature\\". Christine Jenkins writes in Literary Trends that librarians for children especially appreciated its \\"combination of literary quality, child appeal, and positive values.\\" The working class setting and portrayal of migrant families conditions were firsts for children's literature, and the fact that Gates made Janey's best friend a Mexican American was also groundbreaking. Jenkins says \\"the publication and professional recognition accorded Blue Willow was an affirmation of the value of both imaginative and realistic literature for children.\\" When Blue Willow was published there was an ongoing debate among teachers and librarians about whether children's literature should be imaginative or realistic. Blue Willow was both; but the story of Janey, her father and step-mother, living in a shack in central California while working in the fields, was generally more recognized for its realism. Julia Sauer, head children‚Äôs services librarian in Rochester, New York, was commissioned by the American Library Association to address the divisive issue. In Making the World Safe for the Janey Larkins, Sauer wrote \\"We need many more books about the Janey Larkins in our literature for children. And when we get them we will need the courage to give them to our children.\\" In Horn Book, Jan/Feb 1945, Howard Pease's essay \\"Without Evasion\\" says this: \\"Only at infrequent intervals do you find a story intimately related to this modern world, a story that takes up a modern problem and thinks it through without evasion. Of our thousands of books, I can find scarcely half a dozen that merit places on this almost vacant shelf in our libraries; and of our hundreds of authors, I can name only three who are doing anything to fill this void in children's reading. These three authors - may someone present each of them with a laurel wreath - are Doris Gates, John R. Tunis, and Florence Crannell Means.\\" Awards and reception Several of Gates' books were recognized with awards. Blue Willow was one runner-up for the annual Newbery Medal, was named to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list in 1961, and was named one of the Best Books of the Year by Horn Book Magazine. It also won the silver Commonwealth Club of California Book Award. Sarah's Idea and The Cat and Mrs. Cary were also named Horn Book Best Books of the Year, and Little Vic was given the William Allen White Award by the school children of Kansas. Gates' work was appreciated especially for its characterization and sense of place. Twentieth-Century Children's Writers praises her use of traditional story elements and strong sense of structure.Chevalier, Tracy (editor), Twentieth-Century Children's Writers, St. James Press, 1989, pp. 379; According to another reviewer \\"Gates writes with integrity, combining strength of story line with well-developed characters, authentic settings, and themes of consequence.\\" The reviewer goes on to say her excellent characterization and sensitivity toward her characters make her books \\"a solid contribution to American children's literature\\".Cech, John (editor), Dictionary of Literary Biographies: American Writers for Children, 1900-1960, Gale Research, 1983, volume 22, pp. 209; Selected works blue willow pattern like Janey Larkin's in Blue Willow =Children's novels= * Sarah's Idea, Viking Press, 1938 (illustrated by Marjorie Torrey) * Blue Willow, Viking Press, 1940 (illustrated by Paul Lantz) * Sensible Kate, Viking Press, 1943 (illustrated by Marjorie Torrey) * Trouble for Jerry, Viking Press, 1944 (illustrated by Marjorie Torrey) * North Fork, Viking Press, 1945 (illustrated by Wesley Dennis) * My Brother Mike, Viking Press, 1948 (illustrated by Wesley Dennis) * River Ranch, Viking Press, 1949 (illustrated by Jacob Landau) * Little Vic, Viking Press, 1951 (illustrated by Kate Seredy) * Becky and the Bandit, Ginn & Co., 1955 (illustrated by Paul Lantz) * The Cat and Mrs. Cary, Viking Press, 1962 (illustrated by Peggy Bacon (US) and Shirley Hughes (UK)) * The Elderberry Bush, Viking Press, 1967 (illustrated by Lilian Obligado) * A Morgan for Melinda, Viking Press, 1980 * A Filly for Melinda, Viking Press, 1984 =Myths and legends= * Lord of the Sky: Zeus, Viking Press, 1972 (illustrated by Robert Handville) * The Warrior Goddess: Athena, Viking Press, 1972 (illustrated by Don Bolognese) * The Golden God: Apollo, Viking Press, 1973 (illustrated by Constantinos Coconis) * Two Queens of Heaven: Aphrodite and Demeter, Viking Press, 1974 (illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman) * The Mightiest of Mortals: Hercules, Viking Press, 1975 (illustrated by Richard Cuffari) * A Fair Wind for Troy, Viking Press, 1976 (illustrated by Charles Mikolaycak) =Textbooks= * Roads to Everywhere, Ginn, 1961; * Trails to Treasure, Ginn, 1961; * Wings to Adventure, Ginn, 1961; * Along Story Trails, Ginn, 1962; * Down Story Roads, Ginn, 1962; * On Story Wings, Ginn, 1962.

Potomac Hospital, an independent, non-profit community hospital, merged with Sentara Healthcare in December 2009 and is now known as Sentara Northern Virginia Medical Center (from April 16, 2012). The SNVMC market has experienced tremendous growth since the opening of the hospital in 1972. History In 1972, after an eight-year community fundraising effort, Potomac Hospital opened its doors to the residents of eastern Prince William, southern Fairfax and north Stafford Counties. Potomac has come a long way since then, growing from 29 patient beds, 115 employees and 61 physicians to 183 patient beds, more than 1000 employees and more than 250 medical staff members. Before Potomac Hospital opened, there was no civilian hospital between Fredericksburg and Alexandria. Residents of eastern Prince William County knew that building their own hospital would cut travel time for medical care by 30 to 45 minutes. In 1965 the Woodbridge Jaycees hired professional consultants to study the feasibility of building a hospital in the area. Architects were hired and at least five sites were surveyed to determine the hospital's location. In June 1968, community leaders joined together to form the Potomac Hospital Corporation and elected John Johnson, then head of Virginia Power, as president. In 1969 the first hospital membership drive began and soon there were 3,300 members ready and willing to support the hospital's fundraising efforts. The result was that over $2 million was raised by the community to help build and open Potomac Hospital. The Board of Directors hired as the first hospital administrator, L.E. Richardson, Jr. Richardson had recently retired from the U.S. Navy‚Äôs Medical Service Corp. His last duty station was at the Naval Hospital of Quantico Marine Corps base, when the hospital was still a full service institution for the U.S. Marines. Richardson took the new Potomac Hospital through its original construction, opening and first expansion, serving as administrator for the first ten years.

The Polish army was commanded by the Hetmans of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, commanding the armies of their respective country. The most unique formation of both armies was the heavy cavalry in the form of the Polish-Lithuanian winged hussars. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Navy never played a major role in the military structure, and ceased to exist in the mid-17th century. Commonwealth forces were engaged in numerous conflicts in the south (against the Ottoman Empire), the east (against the Tsardom of Muscovy and later, the Russian Empire) and the north (the Kingdom of Sweden); as well as internal conflicts (most notably, numerous Cossack uprisings). For the first century or so, the Commonwealth military was usually successful, but became less so from around the mid-17th century. Plagued by insufficient funds, it found itself increasingly hard-pressed to defend the country, and inferior in numbers to the growing armies of the Commonwealth's neighbors. Following the end of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth military traditions would be continued by Napoleonic Polish Legions and the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw. Background The Commonwealth was formed at the Union of Lublin of 1569 from the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The armies of those states differed from the organization common in western Europe, as according to Bardach, the mercenary formations (Polish: wojsko najemne), common there, never gained popularity in Poland. Brzezinski, however, notes that foreign mercenaries did form a significant portion of the more elite infantry units, at least till the early 17th century. In the 15th century Poland, several other formations formed the core of the military. There was a small standing army, obrona potoczna (\\"continuous defense\\") about 1,500‚Äì3,000 strong, paid for by the king, and primarily stationed at the troubled south and eastern borders. It was supplemented by two formations mobilized in case of war: the pospolite ruszenie (Polish lev√©e en masse ‚Äì feudal levy of mostly noble knights- landholders), and the wojsko zaciƒô≈ºne, recruited by the Polish commanders for the conflict (it differed from Western mercenary formations in that it was commanded by Polish officers, and dissolved after the conflict has ended). Several years before the Union of Lublin, the Polish obrona potoczna was reformed, as the Sejm (national parliament of Poland) legislated in 1562‚Äì1563 the creation of wojsko kwarciane (named after kwarta, the type of tax levied on the royal estate in royal lands for the purpose of maintaining this formation). This formation was also paid for by the king, and in the peacetime, numbered about 3,500‚Äì4,000 men according to Bardach; Brzezinski gives the range of 3,000‚Äì5,000. It was composed mostly of the light cavalry units manned by nobility (szlachta) and commanded by hetmans. Often, in wartime, the Sejm would legislate a temporary increase in the size of the wojsko kwarciane. Operational history Royal Polish Guard, 1732 At its heyday, the Commonwealth comprised the territories of present-day Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, and Russia. It was engaged in the struggles along most of its borders, with only the Western border with the lands of the Holy Roman Empire being relatively peaceful. In its first decades, major conflicts included the Livonian campaign of Stephen B√°thory, the interventions in Moldavia, the Danzig rebellion, and the War against Sigismund. Early 17th century saw a number of the Polish‚ÄìSwedish wars, the Polish‚ÄìOttoman Wars, and the Polish‚ÄìRussian Wars (Dymitriads, the Smolensk War). The Commonwealth also suffered from a number of Cossacks uprisings, culminating in the devastating Chmielnicki Uprising of 1648. That period also saw some of the Commonwealth's most talented military commanders: Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski (1547-1620), Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (1560-1621), Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski (1593-1646) and Stefan Czarniecki (1599-1665). The Commonwealth managed to hold its weight in most of those conflicts, and scored a number of major victories on all fronts, such as the battle of Kircholm, the battle of Klushino, and had briefly garrisoned Moscow. However, the Chmielnicki Uprising, together with the Russo-Polish War and the Swedish Deluge, all taking place around the same period of the 1650s, proved devastating for the country, resulting in a loss of most of Ukraine to Russia in the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667. In 1683 the Commonwealth scored its last major victory that resounded on the European scene, the relief of Vienna by king John III Sobieski. During the 18th century, European powers (most frequently consisting of Russia, Sweden, Prussia and Saxony) fought several wars for the control of the territories of the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, particularly during the Great Northern War. By the end of the 18th century a series of internal conflicts and wars with foreign enemies (the War of the Bar Confederation) led to the dissolution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the partitioning of most of its dependent territories among other European powers. The final attempts to preserve independence of the Commonwealth, including the political reforms of the Great Sejm, eventually failed on the military front, with the Commonwealth defeats in the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792 and the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising of 1794, ultimately ending in Poland's final partition and the final dissolution of the remains of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Composition =Organization= Banner of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian cavalry's squadron. By the time of the Commonwealth formation, there was little practical difference between the Polish and Lithuanian components but they were kept separate; the Lithuanian component formed about a fourth to a third of the Commonwealth army. The army of the Commonwealth was organized along several different models, with the primary division being that into two 'contingents' or 'enlistments' (or in Polish: autorament): national and foreign. The name applied to types of formation, regulations and the officer cadres; the majority of regular recruits for both came from within the Commonwealth, particularly from the 1630s onward. National units included the towarzysz cavalry (including the Winged hussars and lighter pancerni (Polish) and petyhorcy (Lithuanian) units) and some light cavalry units, with infantry being the distant second in reputation; whereas the foreign units were primarily centered around the infantry and artillery formations, with dragoons gaining prominence from the 1620s, and reiter cavalry soon afterward. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian national contingent was organized in traditional formations dating back to the earlier medieval times, with chorƒÖgiew (banner) unit, commanded by a rotmistrz and composed of smaller poczet (lance) retinues, each composed of one towarzysz and a varying number of aides. The size of a chorƒÖgiew could vary from as little as 60 to as many as 300 men. Two or more choragwie (through rarely more than a dozen, and never more than about forty) formed a regiment (pu≈Çk) unit, a type of a unit similar to the medieval battle or modern division or corps. Its senior commander was known as pu≈Çkownik (colonel). The foreign contingent was organized into regiments, often numbering around 500-1,000, and divided into companies. King John III Sobieski made an attempt in the 1670s to replace the national-foreign contingent divisions with a single structure, dividing units into infantry, cavalry and dragoons, but it would take many decades before those reforms bore fruit. =Formations and their evolution= alt= After the creation of the Commonwealth, several new types of military units were introduced. First among these were the registered Cossacks, formed in 1578. These were the troops made up of Cossacks, paid for their service and not subject to serfdom. Their numbers varied from about 500 to many times that number, with the Treaty of Zboriv setting the record at 40,477. The Cossacks' refusal to submit to serfdom, and the Commonwealth's nobility attempts to force them into it led to much political wrangling with regard to the size of the Cossack register, and to numerous Cossack uprisings, particularly in the 17th century. These weakened the state, and eventually led to the Cossack subjugation and destruction by the Russian Empire. In addition to the Cossack formations, another group that provided notable service to the state were the Tatars, some of whom resided in Lithuania, and were Commonwealth subjects. Known as Lipka Tatars, they provided some light and medium cavalry units for the Lithuanian army. In the late 16th century, during the reign of Stefan Batory (1576‚Äì1586), a peasant-based levy formation, piechota wybranicka (lit. drafted or selected infantry, also known as piechota ≈Çanowa, lit. acreage infantry) was formed. It was based on peasants from the royal estates only, who received a unit of land (≈Çan) in exchange for their service. The formation numbered about 2,300 and after early disappointments was never seen as of much military value. It supplemented the few small units of haiduk infantry, which saw service in Poland primarily around late 16th and 17th centuries. In 1655 a new infantry unit was created, the ≈ºo≈Çnierz dymowy (or ≈ºo≈Çnierz ≈Çanowy ‚Äì lit. chimney or ≈Çan soldier, named again after the type of tax applied). It required all lands, no matter whether owned by king, nobles or the Church, to provide peasant recruits, and applied a similar requirement to towns. Starting in 1613, the growing inefficiencies of the central government, as well as an increase in foreign threats, led to the creation of a local territorial defense force, known as ≈ºo≈Çnierz powiatowy (district's soldiers raised by the powiat regions). The artillery formations, at first staffed by foreigners, were reformed in the 1630s, with a new tax levied to support them. This time also marked the introduction of the General of the Artillery post into the Commonwealth army. In the mid-17th century, the numbers of wojsko zaciƒô≈ºne and kwarciane proved to be insufficient, which led to the creation of wojsko komputowe (named after komput, a document passed by the Sejm). Wojsko komputowe numbered (in 1649) 26,000. At the same time, wojsko kwarciane was disbanded, and kwarta directed towards the newly created artillery forces. Brzezinski notes that wojsko kwarciane was dissolved in the aftermath of its defeat at the battle of Batoh in 1652. In 1659, in aftermath of a series of wars, the reformed army numbered around 54,000-60,000; it would decline from that point onward, as the country, impoverished from those wars, would not be able to support such a number again. Another element of the Commonwealth army consisted of various private armies fielded by the most powerful magnates. In time of peace these consisted of usually small regiments of a few hundred men, but at their extreme they could number up to 10,000, including cavalry and artillery. In some instances the magnate contribution could surpass that of the main Commonwealth army on the frontlines, although often the magnates preferred to save their troops, as they were not compensated for the state for their contributions. The troops were paid for and equipped by the richest of the noble families, such as the Opali≈Ñski, Lubomirski, Potocki, Ossoli≈Ñski, Zamoyski, Koniecpolski, Sieniawski, ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, Sapieha, Chodkiewicz, Pac and Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç families. This was one of the reasons why the magnates played a major role in Polish politics, and on occasion, allowed them to engage in bloody civil wars (such as the Lithuanian Civil War in 1700) amongst themselves. Similarly, occasional forces of town guard and militia were fielded by some cities. The most impressive town guard and accompanying fortifications belonged to the port of Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig), which in 1646 boasted 12 infantry companies of 6,000 men total. There was also a small royal guard regiment, paid for directly by the king. In peacetime, the royal guard numbered around 1,200, but would often be expanded during time of war. The royal force included a hussar banner, reiter cavalry element, and an infantry unit, based upon the \\"foreign\\" model. Finally, there were also some irregular militia or mercenary troops which received no official pay but operated with the permission of the government and were allowed to retain their loot; most notable of these were the Lisowczycy mercenary group which operated in the first half of the 17th century. Both the state and the magnates supported the construction and renovations of several fortifications (such as the Kamianets- Podilskyi Castle). =Command structure= The army of the Commonwealth was commanded by king, under whom served four hetmans: two Grand Hetmans (the Grand Crown Hetman and Grand Lithuanian Hetman) and two Field Hetmans (the Field Crown Hetman and Field Lithuanian Hetman). The office of a hetman appeared in the late 15th century as a consequence of the introduction of the wojsko zaciƒô≈ºne, and a need for a more professional army commanders than the king could usually provide. By the 1530s the hetman system has evolved into that of regular offices that would exist both in Poland and Lithuania for the next three centuries. From 1581 it became officially a lifelong appointment. Hetmans had the right to carry out summary justice in the field. Grand Crown Hetman had the right to maintain his representatives in the Ottoman Empire, which allowed him to influence Poland‚ÄìOttoman relations and also laid groundwork for the first Polish intelligence services. Hetman deputy was known as regimentarz and could replace a hetman on a temporary basis. Navy The Commonwealth Navy was small and played a relatively minor role in the history of the Commonwealth. Despite having access to the Baltic Sea, neither Poland nor Lithuania had any significant navy throughout their histories. In the 16th century, as Poland and Lithuania became involved in conflicts in Livonia, Polish king Sigismund II Augustus supported the operations of privateers, but that met with opposition of the Poland's primary port, Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig), which saw them as a threat to its trade operations. This led to the development of a privateer port in Puck. At the turn of the century, Poland became ruled by the House of Vasa, and was involved in a series of wars with Sweden (see also dominium maris baltici). Vasa kings attempted to create a proper fleet, and W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa built a dedicated port for the royal navy (W≈Çadys≈Çawowo), but their attempts met with repeated failures, due to lack of funds in the royal treasury (seeing little need for the fleet, Polish nobility refused to raise taxes for its construction, and Gda≈Ñsk continued its opposition to the idea of a royal fleet). Although W≈Çadys≈Çaw bought 12 ships, they were sold between 1641 and 1643, marking the end of the Commonwealth Navy. Logistics and tactics Due to lack of centralized logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered by large baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage with the development of the tabor ‚Äì military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack of sufficient funding. Problems and reforms With the growing influence of foreign powers in the Commonwealth, the Russian-dominated Silent Sejm of 1717 declared that the size of the Commonwealth Army should be 24,200 (18,000 from Poland and 6,200 for Lithuania). Due to insufficient taxation, the military was often not paid properly, which led to a relatively small army size; in mid-18th century, the Commonwealth had funds to field an army of around 24,000, whereas the Commonwealth's neighbors' armies were often up to 12 times larger: the Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000; the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army, 150,000, and a few decades later, the Commonwealth could field an army of about 16,000, with Prussian and Austrian armies rising to 200,000. The stated size of the Commonwealth army was further exaggerated, as some money was lost due to corruption. The first half of the 18th century, following the 1717 Sejm, marks the nadir of the Commonwealth army, as it lacked funds and training, and was primarily used for ceremonial purposes. The only constructive reform of that time was the introduction of a stable (if grossly insufficient) budget for the military. Furthermore, the unpaid units of the army were known for mutinying and forming confederations, occupying the Commonwealth's own lands until such a time that they were paid properly or pillaged enough to satisfy themselves. The trend reversed itself following the election of the last king of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus, in 1765 and the introduction of the new governing body, Permanent Council, in 1775. Its Military Department attempted to modernize the army, and increase its size (although even the target number of 30,000 was never achieved). A major military reform came with the passing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791, which stated that the Army was to be built up to 100,000 men. (The exact number would be settled on only on 22 May 1792, at 25,654 cavalry and 72,910 infantry). A new conscription law was introduced, affecting all lands (royal, noble and Church-owned). With the days of the Commonwealth numbered, the Constitution was never fully implemented in practice, although the new Military Commission saw the Army expanded to 65,000 before the Polish defeat in the War in Defense of the Constitution. After the Commonwealth defeat in that war and the rescinding of the Constitution, the Army was reduced to about 36,000. In 1794 Russians demanded a further downsizing of the army to 15,000. This plan was one of the sparks that led to the Army's (and Commonwealth's) final conflict, the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising.

It was published by Houghton Mifflin (US) and The Bodley Head (UK). The author worked in Malawi from 1963 to 1965 with the United States Peace Corps, before being deported for public criticism of dictator Hastings Banda. Because the Banda regime did not like the novel, it was banned in Malawi for many years.Paul Theroux, Dark Star Safari, page 329, Penguin edition publ. 2002, Inspiration After being deported from Malawi, Theroux was fired from the Peace Corps, as he had violated restrictions against getting involved in country politics. He moved to Asia and in 1968 got a job teaching Jacobean literature at the University of Singapore. One of the conditions was that he neither write nor publish anything about Singapore while he was there. He instead wrote a novel inspired by his time in Malawi, keeping his writing secret from his employers. He contracted dengue fever and was able to work on the book only in the evenings and at weekends. It took him over two years to write. In an introduction to the novel for the German edition, Theroux revealed that the two main characters, an insurance salesman and a revolutionary activist, were two opposing sides of his own personality. He had thought he could protect his pupils while he was a teacher in the country, but spoke out in support of the opposition at a time of political turmoil. He was deported from Malawi in 1965, charged with 'covert revolutionary activities'. He later wrote that this was 'a novel of futility and failed hopes'.Paul Theroux, Sunrise with Seamonsters, Hamish Hamilton, 1985, pp. 328-330 & 364 Plot introduction The story concerns Calvin Mullet from Hudson, Massachusetts, a recently divorced insurance salesman working in Malawi; and Marais, a white leader of a guerrilla army intent on overthrowing the government of the country. Calvin is based in a brothel in the capital Blantyre but makes frequent journeys to Lilongwe further north, where he is captured by Marais (to whom he tries to sell a policy) and then released. Disillusioned with his work, Calvin is secretly writing a book, The Uninsured, as an outlet to his frustrations. In one of his trips to Lilongwe he meets and falls in love with Mira, a young native girl. On a later return trip, he learns that her brother has been killed and she has been raped by Marais' rebels. He brings her to the south and marries her. Reception *Mordecai Richler, writing in the New York Times, said: > '\\"Jungle Lovers\\" is filled with incidental delights, some very funny set- > pieces.

In 1832, his family began operating M. A. Patout Enterprise. The firm is managed by a non-family member president and board of trustees, but Patout continued in his later years as a consultant and a member of the company board of directors, who remain family members. Early life and education Patout was the oldest son of William S. Patout, Jr. (1908‚Äì1991), and the former Hester Catherine Bernadas (1911‚Äì1982). When Patout was eight years old, his family moved to Patoutville in Iberia Parish, where he developed his interest in the sugar industry. Patout earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Engineering from Louisiana State University. Career After graduating from college, Patout began his career with the M. A. Patout Company in 1956. He worked there as an assistant engineer for three years before moving on to become an engineer for Brewer & Co. in Honolulu from 1959 to 1960. He moved from company to company to gain work experience before rejoining his family's company in 1970. He started as an assistant general manager and worked his way up to president and chief executive officer. Patout is credited with having kept M. A. Patout afloat during his tenure. Despite drought, crop disease, hurricanes, freezes, low sugar prices, and the loss of land because of pressure from residential and commercial developments, Patout was able to expand the company. He acquired Sterling Sugars, Inc., from former Governor Mike Foster and Raceland Sugars. He increased the sugar-growing acreage from 12,000 to 56,000. Under Patout's leadership, the Enterprise mill in Patoutville became the first and only factory to mill two million tons of cane, and was the only cane diffuser operating in North America. Patout sat on the board of M. A. Patout and was a consultant for sugar businesses around the world. He advised China on the country's sugar industry and was also served as an advisor to the United States Department of Commerce, in addition to private companies in Jamaica and Mexico. =M. A. Patout= M. A. Patout & Sons, Ltd. is the 18th oldest family-owned company in the United States, incorporated in 1910. It began when Simeon Patout moved his family from France, where he ran a winery, to Isle Picante in Louisiana in the late 1820s. He began growing sugar cane and built a sugar mill. The area was renamed Patoutville. When Simeon died of yellow fever in 1847, his wife Appoline took over the company, and under her direction, it continued to grow. Her son Hippolyte ran the company for a short time before he, too, succumbed to the disease, after which his widow, Mary Ann Schwing Patout, assumed control. Highly successful, she became the United States' first female member of a bank board and later its president. After her stint as head of M. A. Patout, the company was run by family members (in chronological order) Hippolyte Jr., William S. Patout, William S. Patout, Jr., and William S. Patout, III. Billy Patout then hired a non-family member, Craig P. Caillier, to head the operations. Today M. A. Patout runs three sugar mills which produce about a third of the sugar in the state of Louisiana, or 450,000 tons per year. =Awards and other activities= Patout won the Dyer Memorial \\"Sugar Man of the Year\\" award in 2007 and various other Louisiana awards throughout his career. In addition to M. A. Patout, Patout was involved with: * American Sugar Cane League, an interest group which seeks to direct agricultural and manufacturing research and impact legislation in Louisiana and in Washington D.C.; director, 1974‚Äì1999, and past president, 1997‚Äì1999 * Western Sugar Producers (represented Bayou Teche sugar factories): past president, 1974‚Äì1975; received the league's President's Award in 2000. * Sugar Processing Research Institute (worked with United States Department of Agriculture): member, 1990‚Äì2001; past president, 1999‚Äì2001 * Agro-Flex (non-profit whose goal was to bring more agricultural business to Louisiana): past president, 1975‚Äì1975 * In 1997, he became a board member of the First National Bank of Jeanerette.  Personal life  From 1954 to 1955, Patout served in the United States Navy. He married Susan Ann Crawford of Indiana in 1971, and the couple had seven children. At the time of his death, Patout had seventeen grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. Patout died in Lafayette, Louisiana at the age of 84 on August 5, 2017. A Roman Catholic, he is entombed at St. Nicholas Cemetery in Patoutville.

Plot A nine-year-old girl's name is in dispute. Manuela is named after her father, a socialist and atheist; but her grandmother, Catholic and conservative, insists on giving her the name that all the first-born of the family have carried for generations: Dolores. The story takes place in a valley in the Ecuadorian Andes, in the summer of 1976.

The lower antenna is a bowtie array. The upper antenna is a Yagi design. UHF television broadcasting is the use of ultra high frequency (UHF) radio for over-the-air transmission of television signals. UHF frequencies are used for both analog and digital television broadcasts. UHF channels are typically given higher channel numbers, like the US arrangement with VHF channels 2 to 13, and UHF channels numbered 14 to 83. Compared with an equivalent VHF television transmitter, to cover the same geographic area with a UHF transmitter requires a higher effective radiated power, implying a more powerful transmitter or a more complex antenna. However, the additional channels allow more broadcasters in a given region without causing objectionable mutual interference. UHF broadcasting became possible due to the introduction of new high-frequency vacuum tubes developed by Philips immediately prior to the opening of World War II. These were used in experimental television receivers in the UK in the 1930s, and became widely used during the war as radar receivers. Surplus tubes flooded the market in the post-war era. At the same time, the development of color television was taking its first steps, initially based on incompatible transmission systems. The US FCC set aside a block of the then-unused and now-practical UHF frequencies for color television use. The introduction of the backward compatible NTSC standard led to these channels being released for any television use in 1952. Early receivers were generally less efficient at UHF band reception, and the signals are also subject to more environmental interference. Additionally, the signals are less susceptible to diffraction effects, which can improve reception at long range. UHF generally had less clear signals, and for some markets, became the home of smaller broadcasters who were not willing to bid on the more coveted VHF allocations. These issues are greatly reduced with digital television, and today most over-the-air broadcasts take place on UHF, while VHF channels are being retired. To avoid the appearance of disappearing channels, digital broadcast systems have a virtual channel concept, allowing stations to keep their original VHF channel number while actually broadcasting on a UHF frequency. Over time a number of former television channels in the upper UHF band have been re-designated for other uses. Channel 37 was never used in the US and some other countries in order to prevent interference with radio astronomy. In 1983, the US FCC removed channels 70 through 83 and reassigned them to Land Mobile Radio System. In 2009, with the move to digital television complete in the US, channels 52 through 69 were reallocated as the 700 MHz band for cellular telephone service. In 2011, Channel 51 was removed to prevent interference with the 700 MHz band. Additionally, in 2019 the US removed channels 38 through 50 for cellular phone service. The US UHF channel map now only includes channels 14 through 36. UHF vs VHF This modern DTV antenna uses a Yagi for UHF reception placed in front of a log-periodic for VHF-high. Although the UHF band has five times as many channels as VHF, the antenna needed to receive them is much smaller in both length and width. An older design that also received VHF-low would have many more elements extending to the right. The most common type of antennas rely on the concept of resonance. Conductors, normally metal wires or rods, are cut to a length so that the desired radio signal will create a standing wave of electrical current within them. This means that antennas have a natural size, normally of a wavelength long, which maximizes performance. Antennas designed to receive a given signal will almost always have similar dimensions. Because the antenna size is based on the wavelength, UHF broadcasting can be received with much smaller antennas than VHF while still having the same gain. For instance, Channel 2 in the North American television frequencies is at 54 MHz, which corresponds to a wavelength of 5.5 m, and thus requires dipole antenna about 2.75 m across. In comparison, the lowest channel in the UHF map, Channel 14, is on 470 MHz, a wavelength of 64 cm, or a dipole length of only 32 cm. A powerful VHF antenna using the log-periodic design might be as long as 3 m, while a UHF Yagi antenna with similar gain is often found placed in front of it, occupying perhaps 1 m. Modern UHF-only antennas often use the bedspring array and are less than a meter on a side. Another effect due to the shorter wavelength is that UHF signals can pass through smaller openings than VHF. These openings are created by any metal in the area, including lines of nails or screws in the roof and walls, electrical wiring, and the frames of doors and windows. A metal-framed window will present almost no barrier to a UHF signal, while a VHF signal may be attenuated or strongly diffracted. For strong signals, UHF antennas mounted beside the television are relatively useful, and medium- distance signals, , can often be picked up by attic mounted antennas. On the downside, higher frequencies are less susceptible to diffraction. This means that the signals will not bend around obstructions as readily as a VHF signal. This is a particular problem for receivers located in depressions and valleys. Normally the upper edge of the landform acts as a knife-edge and causes the signal to diffract downwards. VHF signals will be seen by antennas in the valley, whereas UHF bends about as much, and far less signal will be received. The same effect also makes UHF signals more difficult to receive around obstructions. VHF will quickly diffract around trees and poles and the received energy immediately downstream will be about 40% of the original signal. In comparison, UHF blockage by the same obstruction will result on the order of 10% being received. Another difference is the nature of the electrical and radio noise encountered on the two frequency bands. UHF bands are subject to constant levels of low-level noise that appear as \\"snow\\" on an analog screen. VHF more commonly sees impulse noise that produces a sharp \\"blip\\" of noise, but leaves the signal clear at other times. This normally comes from local electrical sources, and can be mitigated by turning them off. This means that at a given received power, a UHF analog signal will appear worse than VHF, often significantly. For these reasons, in order to allow UHF stations to provide the same ground coverage as VHF, ideally about , the FCC allowed UHF broadcasters to operate at much higher power levels. For analog signals in the United States, VHF signals on channels 2 to 6, the low-VHF range, were limited to 100 kW, high-VHF on channels 7 to 13 to 316 kW, and UHF to 5 MW, well over 10 times the power of the low-VHF transmitter power limit. This greatly increased the cost of transmitting in these frequencies, both in electrical cost as well as the upfront cost of the equipment needed to reach those power levels. The introduction of digital television (DTV) changed the relative outcome of these effects. DTV systems use a system known as forward error correction (FEC) which adds additional information to the signal to allow it to correct errors. This works well if the error rate is well known, in which case a fixed amount of extra information is added to the signal to correct for these errors. This works well with constant low-level interference found on UHF, which FEC can effectively eliminate. In comparison, VHF noise is largely unpredictable, consisting of periods of little noise followed by periods of almost complete signal loss. Forward error correction cannot easily address this situation. For this reason, DTV broadcasting was initially going to take place entirely on UHF. In the US, the FCC initially wanted to move all stations to UHF, auctioning off the VHF frequencies for cell phone use. This required a large number of stations to move out of their current VHF channel assignments. Moving from one UHF channel to another is a fairly simple exercise and generally costs little to accomplish. Moving from VHF to UHF is a much more expensive proposition, generally requiring all new equipment, and a dramatic increase in power in order to maintain the same service area. DTV offsets the latter to a great degree, with the current FCC power limitations at 1 MW for UHF, the former limits. Nevertheless, moving from a 100 kW low-VHF analog signal to a 1 MW UHF signal is still a considerable change, which some broadcasters estimated could cost up to $4 million per station (although most estimates were much lower, on the order of $400,000). For this reason, channels in the high-VHF region were kept for television use. The power of the stations on these channels was also reduced, to 160 kW, about one-third of the earlier limit. Stations making the transition generally acquired a second channel allocation in the upper UHF region to test their new equipment, and then moved into the low-UHF or high-VHF once the conversion period was over. This adds some complexity to the system as a whole, as the antennas needed to receive VHF and UHF are very different. Australia In Australia, UHF was first anticipated in the mid-1970s with TV channels 27‚Äì69. The first UHF TV broadcasts in Australia were operated by Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) on channel 28 in Sydney and Melbourne starting in 1980, and translator stations for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The UHF band is now used extensively as ABC, SBS, commercial and public-access television services have expanded, particularly through regional areas. Canada The first Canadian television network was publicly owned Radio-Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Its stations, as well as that of the first private networks (CTV and TVA, created in 1961), are primarily VHF. More recent third-network operators initially signing-on in the 1970s or 1980s were often relegated to UHF, or (if they were to attempt to deploy on VHF) to reduced power or stations in outlying areas. Canada's VHF spectrum was already crowded with both domestic broadcasts and numerous American TV stations along the border. The use of UHF to provide programming that otherwise would not be available, such as province-wide educational services (BC's Knowledge: channel, or TVOntario - the first UHF originating station in Canada), T√©l√©-Qu√©bec, French language programming outside Qu√©bec and ethnic/multilingual television services), has therefore become common. Third networks such as Quatre-Saisons or Global often will rely heavily on UHF stations as repeaters or as a local presence in large cities where VHF spectrum is largely already full. The original digital terrestrial television stations were all UHF broadcasts, although some digital broadcasts returned to VHF channels after the digital transition was completed in August 2011. Digital Audio Broadcasting, deployed on a very limited scale in Canada in 2005 and largely abandoned, uses UHF frequencies in the L band from 1452 to 1492 MHz. There are currently no VHF Band III digital radio stations in Canada as, unlike in much of Europe, these frequencies are among the most popular for use by television stations. Ireland In the Republic of Ireland, UHF was introduced in 1978 to augment the existing RT√â One VHF 625-line transmissions and to provide extra frequencies for the new RT√â Two channel. The first UHF transmitter site was Cairn Hill in Co. Longford, followed by Three Rock Mountain in South Co. Dublin. These sites were followed by Clermont Carn in Co. Louth and Holywell Hill in Co. Donegal in 1981. Since the analogue television switchoff on October 24, 2012, all digital terrestrial TV is on UHF only, although VHF allocations exist. The UHF band has been used in parts of Ireland for television deflector systems bringing British television signals to towns and rural areas that cannot receive these signals directly however since the introduction of free to air satellite transmission of UK TV channels these deflectors have largely ceased operation. Japan In Japan, an is one of a loosely knit group of free commercial terrestrial television stations that is not a member of the major national networks keyed in Tokyo and Osaka. Japan's original broadcasters were VHF. Although some experimental broadcasts were made as early as 1939, NHK (founded in 1926 as a radio network modeled on the BBC) began regular VHF television broadcasting in 1953. Its two terrestrial television services (NHK General TV and NHK Educational TV) appear on VHF 1 and 3, respectively, in the Tokyo region. Privately owned Japanese VHF TV stations were most often built by large national newspapers with Tokyo stations exerting a large degree of control over national programming. The number of VHF broadcasters varied depending on the prefecture. For example, in the Kanto region, there were seven VHF channels available. Outside of Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Fukuoka, most prefectures had four privately owned television stations, with three of them broadcasting on UHF. Almost all prefectures had at least one privately owned VHF television station (except for Saga). The independent stations broadcast in analogue UHF, unlike major networks, which were historically broadcast primarily in analogue VHF. The loose coalition of UHF independents is operated mostly by local governments or metropolitan newspapers with less outside control. Compared with major network stations, Japan's UHF independents have more restrictive programming acquisition budgets and lower average ratings; they are also more likely to broadcast single episode or short-series UHF anime (many of which serve to promote DVD's or other product tie-ins) and brokered programming such as religion and infomercials. Japanese terrestrial television was converted entirely to digital UHF starting in December 2003, with all analogue television signals (both VHF and UHF) being terminated between 2010 and 2012. The analogue translators in northeastern Ishikawa Prefecture were shut down as part of a technical trial on 24 July 2010; analogue signals in the rest of that prefecture and 43 other prefectures were terminated on 24 July 2011. The analogue transmitters in the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima were switched off on 31 March 2012. Malaysia UHF broadcasting was used outside Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley by private TV station TV3 in the late 1980s, with the government stations only transmitting in VHF (Bands 1 and 3) and the 450 MHz range being occupied by the ATUR cellular phone service operated by Telekom Malaysia. The ATUR service ceased operation in the late 1990s, freeing up the frequency for other uses. UHF was not commonly used in the Klang Valley until 1994 (despite TV3's signal also being available over UHF Channel 29, as TV3 transmitted over VHF Channel 12 in the Klang Valley). 1994 saw the introduction of the channel MetroVision (which ceased transmission in 1999, got bought over by TV3's parent company ‚Äì System Televisyen Malaysia Berhad ‚Äì and relaunched as 8TV in 2004). This was followed by Ntv7 in 1998 (also acquired by TV3's parent company in 2005) and recently Channel 9 (which started in 2003, ceased transmission in 2005, was also acquired by TV3's parent company shortly after, and came back as TV9 in early 2006). At current count, there are 6 distinct UHF signals receivable by an analog TV set in the Klang Valley: Channel 27 (8TV), Channel 29 (TV3 UHF transmission), Channel 37 (NTV7), Channel 42 (TV9), Channel 55 (TV Alhijrah) and Channel 39 (WBC). Channel 35 is usually allocated for VCRs, decoder units (i.e. the ASTRO and MiTV set top boxes) and other devices that have an RF signal generator (i.e. game consoles). New Zealand Refer to Australasian television frequencies for more information. Philippines UHF broadcasting was introduced in the Philippines in the early 1960s when FEN Philippines began broadcasts on channel 17 in Pampanga and Zambales (as in Subic and Clark bases), and channel 43 in Bulacan and also in Metro Manila on Channel 50 until 1991 (most of its programs and newscasts are from a satellite feed directly from their U.S. military bases in Japan), at the time when Mount Pinatubo erupted and became abandoned. Commercial UHF stations began in May, 1992, as DWCP-TV on channel 21 became the first local UHF TV station in Metro Manila by the Southern Broadcasting Network as SBN-21 (then Talk TV) and commenced free programing, the second channel, DWKC-TV (on channel 31) of the Radio Mindanao Network was launched on October 31 of the same year as CTV-31 from 1992 to 2000 (then E! from 2000 to 2003 and BEAM in 2011). The third channel, DZRJ-TV (channel 29) was also launched in 1993 for the Rajah Broadcasting Network, Inc. which specializes niche programing (mostly infomercials, foreign shows and cartoons). Two more channels include DWDB-TV (channel 27) of GMA Network, Inc. (as Citynet Television from 1995 to 1999 and EMC from 1999 to 2001) and DWAC- TV (channel 23) of ABS-CBN (as Studio 23) between August 27, 1995 and October 12, 1996, as fourth and fifth UHF stations, and the sixth and the last, DWDZ- TV (channel 47) of the Associated Broadcasting Company in 1999, but it was silent in 2003. UHF channels in Metro Manila were used as an alternative to cable television which offered free programing for households in the target markets and became popular in the 1990s. Similarly, pay services were also introduced in late 1992, when DWBC-TV on channel 68 began initial transmissions as a paid UHF station offers foreign programs not shown on local TV and commencing regular service in January 1993, but it was closed down as a result from intense competition from the rival Sky Cable. From 2001 to the present, more channels were established, regional stations are established in the provinces which specialize news, public service and free programing. With Digital TV was introduced, all UHF channels will allocate their frequencies and can be served for broadcast companies such as ABS-CBN, GMA Network and TV5, among others as the National Telecommunications Commission plans to migrate all VHF channels to digital UHF channels before December 31, 2015, though this was delayed until 2020 or 2023. Digital terrestrial television services are currently in development by the major broadcasting companies before the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) will be passed by law. South Africa South Africa only received analog TV service in the 1970s There were four TV channels: TV1 (now SABC1), TV2 (now SABC2), TV3 (now SABC3), and later came Etv. United Kingdom In the UK, UHF television began in 1964 following a plan by the General Post Office to allocate sets of frequencies for 625-lined television to regions across the country, so as to accommodate four national networks with regional variations (the VHF allocations allowed for only two such networks using 405 lines). The UK UHF channels would range from 21 to 68 (later extended to 69) and regional allocations were in general grouped close together to allow for the use of aerials designed to receive a specific sub-band with greater efficiency than wider-band aerials could. Aerial manufacturers would therefore divide the band into over-lapping groups; A (channels 21‚Äì34), B (39‚Äì53), C/D (48‚Äì68) and E (39‚Äì68). The first service to use UHF was BBC2 in 1964 followed by BBC1 and ITV (already broadcast on VHF) in 1969 and Channel 4/S4C in 1982. PAL colour was introduced on UHF only in 1967 (for BBC2) and 1969 (for BBC1 & ITV). As a consequence of achieving maximum national coverage, signals from one region would typically over-lap with that of another, which was accommodated for by allocating a different set of channels in each adjacent area, often resulting in greater choice for viewers when a network in one region aired different programmes to the neighbouring region. Initial uptake of UHF television was very slow: Differing propagation characteristics between VHF and UHF meant new additional transmitters needed to be built, often at different locations to the then-established VHF sites, and in general with a larger number of relay stations to fill the greater number of gaps in coverage that came with the new band. This led to poor picture quality in bad coverage areas, and many years before the service achieved full national coverage. In addition to this, the only exclusively UHF service, BBC2, would run for only a few hours a day and run alternative programming for minority audiences in contrast to the more populist schedules of BBC1 and ITV. However the 1970s saw a large increase in UHF TV viewing while VHF took a significant decline: The appeal of colour, which was never introduced to VHF (despite preliminary plans to do so in the late 1950s and early 1960s) and the fall in television prices saw most households use a UHF set by the end of that decade. With the second and last VHF television service having launched in 1955, VHF TV was finally decommissioned for good in 1985 with no plans for it to return to use. The launch of Channel 5 in 1997 added a fifth national television network to UHF, requiring deviation from the original frequency allocation plan of the early 1960s and the allocation of UHF frequencies previously not used for television (such as UK Channels 35 and 37, previously reserved for RF modulators in devices such as domestic videocassette recorders, requiring an expensive VCR re-tuning programme funded by the new network). A lack of capacity within the band to accommodate a fifth service with the complex over-lapping led to the fifth and final network having a significantly reduced national coverage compared to the other networks, with reduced picture quality in many areas and the use of wide-band aerials often required. The launch of digital terrestrial television in 1998 saw the continued use of UHF for television, with six multiplexes allocated for the service, all within the UHF band. However analogue transmissions have been planned to cease completely by 2012 after which time it is uncertain as to whether the vacated capacity will be used for additional digital television services or put into alternative use, such as mobile telecommunications or internet services.  United States  = The need for the UHF band = Bandwidth for television in the United States was allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1937, solely in the VHF (Very High Frequency) band, across 18 channels. American television broadcasting began experimentally in the 1930s with regular commercial broadcasting in cities such as New York and Chicago in 1941. Efforts at TV broadcasting on any channel were drastically curtailed once World War II began, due largely to lack of available receivers. The upper five VHF channels were removed from the FCC allocation list during the war with those frequencies re-allocated for military use, leaving thirteen channels (1 through 13) as of May 1945. The end of the war brought rapid expansion in the nascent broadcast television industry. Thirteen VHF channels was found to be insufficient to support the desired expansion of broadcast television across the United States. Interference and channel crowding in densely populated areas (such as the eastern mid-Atlantic states) was a particular problem. This bandwidth crunch was made even worse by the need to re-allocate VHF Channel 1 to land-mobile radio systems in 1948 due to radio-interference problems. To illustrate the channel crowding problem, the following cities were never allocated any VHF-TV stations at all, due to technical reasons found by the FCC: Huntsville, Alabama; Fort Wayne, Indiana; South Bend, Indiana, Lexington, Kentucky; Springfield, Massachusetts; Youngstown, Ohio; Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; and Yakima, Washington. Other cites were able to receive only one VHF broadcast station. The entire state of New Jersey would receive only one VHF broadcast station of its own (which was to ultimately become WNET 13 Newark). Similarly, Delaware also had only one VHF station. Meanwhile, UHF broadcasting until 1949 was designated as experimental. In the fall of 1944, the Columbia Broadcasting System proposed a high-definition black and white system on the UHF band employing 750‚Äì1,000 scanning lines that offered the possibility of higher-definition monochrome and color broadcasting, both then were precluded from the VHF band because of their bandwidth demands; more significantly, it offered the possibility for sufficient numbers of conventional 6 MHz channels to support the FCC's goals of a \\"truly nationwide and competitive service\\". CBS was not trying maximize broadcast (or network) competition through freer market entry. Instead CBS's 16 MHz channels would have allowed only 27 UHF channels versus the 82 channels possible under the standard 6 MHz bandwidth. CBS Vice President Adrian Murphy told the FCC: \\"I would say that it would be better to have two networks in color\\" instead of the four or more networks possible with narrower bandwidths in UHF. In October 1948, the Federal Communications Commission stopped accepting applications for new stations, a freeze expected to last \\"six months to a year\\". The freeze would give the FCC and broadcasting interests time to address questions such as the allocation of additional channel frequencies, and the selection of a color television standard. At the time of the freeze, less than 100 stations were on the air, but stations already under construction would be allowed to complete work. All but one of these was on the VHF band; on December 29, 1949, KC2XAK of Bridgeport, Connecticut, became the first and only pre-1950 UHF television station to operate on a regular daily schedule. Existing FCC rules at the time of the freeze had designated 42 UHF channels, designated 14‚Äì55, between 475‚Äì890 MHz. = Freeze on new television stations (1948) = Ultimately, the question the FCC faced of how to allocate bandwidth for new television licenses would not take \\"months\\" to resolve, but several years. To newer entrants into TV broadcasting such as the American Broadcasting Company and DuMont Television Network, the need for additional TV channels in major markets was urgent. For proponents of educational TV broadcasting, the difficulties in competing with commercial broadcasters for the increasingly scarce VHF channels was also a problem.\\"Missed Opportunities: FCC Commissioner Frieda Hennock and the UHF Debacle\\", Susan L. Brinson, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Spring 2000 Allocating more of the VHF band (30 to 300 MHz) by moving existing radio communication users away seemed to be impossible. FM radio broadcasting had already suffered a huge setback after a forced move from a 42‚Äì50 MHz allocation to an 88‚Äì108 MHz allocation in 1946. This had rendered all pre-1946 FM transmitters and receivers obsolete, and there was heavy resistance to moving FM a second time. Aeronautical radio is located above 108 MHz; military aeronautical radio used 225‚Äì400 MHz. Additional public safety, commercial land-mobile, and amateur radio services had allocations in Band II. It was impractical and uneconomic to require these well-established VHF users to move to other frequencies, such as the 300 MHz ‚Äì 3 GHz UHF band. All of this made expansion of broadcast television channels into the UHF band inevitable, though the technology and broadcasting characteristics of UHF was at this time largely unproven. Even the television standard to use to broadcast on UHF was in question at the time of the 1948 FCC freeze. With the knowledge that UHF channel allocation would be necessary to expand television coverage, and with the knowledge that by 1949 VHF television was an entrenched standard, the FCC proposed intermixture, licensing both VHF and UHF stations in a single city. Intermixture would rely on consumers rapidly adopting television sets with UHF tuning capability, and on the base assumption that a UHF television station was functionally equivalent to a VHF one. To allocate four to as many as seven VHF channels to each of the largest cities would mean forcing the smaller, intervening cities completely onto UHF channels, while an allocation scheme that sought to assign one or two VHF channels in each smaller city would force VHF and UHF stations to compete in most markets. The largest cities with the most sets in use benefitted most from VHF allocations. For example, New York City, Washington- Baltimore, Los Angeles, and San Francisco received seven VHF stations apiece, and Chicago was allocated five, with the other two of those channels going to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Rockford, Illinois. FCC rules published on April 11, 1952, defined the final modern-day UHF allocation of 70 channels, 14 through 83, with 6 MHz separation. It used standard NTSC standards. This would allow the license freeze enacted in 1949 to end. Through the entire three-and-a-half year freeze period, KC2XAK remained the only UHF television station in regular operation. = End of the license freeze (1952) = When the FCC television license freeze ended in 1952, a huge backlog of potential stations applied, many allocated to the UHF band as defined by the 1952 rules. The first commercially licensed UHF television station was WWLP in Springfield, Massachusetts; however, the first commercial UHF television station on the air was KPTV, Channel 27, in Portland, Oregon, on September 18, 1952. Early in 1953, 35% of televisions sold contained a UHF tuner compliant with 1952 rules, lending hope to the idea that intermixture of UHF and VHF stations might succeed.  UHF reception issues  thumb Several problems with early UHF tuners became evident. One was poor image frequency rejection in superheterodyne receivers with the standard intermediate frequency of 45.75 MHz. Another was very poor adjacent-channel rejection and channel selectivity by early tuner designs and manufactures. These problems were so significant that UHF-TV stations in the same geographic area were usually assigned a minimum of six channels apart from one another. Technical problems with the design of vacuum tubes for operation at high UHF frequencies were beginning to be addressed in 1954,\\"VALVES AT UHF: A REVIEW OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\\", S. Simpson, Practical Television magazine, March 1954. but in the meantime, these shortcomings led to \\"UHF taboos\\", which in effect limited each metropolitan area to only moderately more UHF stations than VHF ones, despite the much higher number of channels.\\"The Superheterodyne Concept and Reception\\". Charles W. Rhodes, TV Technology, July 20, 2005. Television sets in the United States were not mandated to include UHF tuners until 1964. With UHF's reputation for reception problems, the fraction of new TV receivers that were factory- equipped with all-channel tuners dropped from 35% in early 1953 to 9% by 1958, a drop that was only partially compensated for by field upgrades or the availability of external UHF converters for separate purchase. Plummeting inclusion of UHF tuners in sets placed VHF‚ÄìUHF intermixture at grave risk of failure.  UHF transmission issues  On the transmission side, UHF stations were also found to have issues involving transmission distance and strength. The FCC tried solving this problem by allowing the lower powered UHF stations to broadcast with more power, but VHF continued to have more stations. Advertisers soon caught on to this and did most of their business with VHF stations since UHF tuner adoption was flagging.Sterling, C. H., & Kittross, J. M. (1990). Stay Tuned: A Concise History of American Broadcasting (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. While the more-established broadcasters were operating profitably on VHF channels as affiliates of the two largest TV networks (at the time, NBC and CBS), most of the original UHF local stations of the 1950s soon went bankrupt, limited by the range their signals could travel, the lack of UHF tuners in most TV sets and the paucity of advertisers willing to spend money on them. UHF stations fell quickly behind the VHF stations, losing $10,500,000 in 1953. More stations left the air than opened, and sixty percent of television industry losses from 1953 to 1956 losses came from UHF stations. TV network affiliations were difficult to get in many locations; the UHF stations with major-network affiliation would often lose these affiliations in favor of any viable new VHF TV station that entered the same market. Of the 82 new UHF-TV stations in the United States broadcasting as of June 1954, only 24 of them remained a year later. The majority of the 165 UHF stations to begin telecasting between 1952 and 1959 did not survive. Not until the passage of the 1962 All-Channel Receiver Act did FCC regulations require all new TV sets sold in the U.S. after April 30, 1964 to have built-in UHF tuners that could receive channels 14‚Äì83. In spite of this, by 1971, only about 170 full-service UHF stations were in operation.Stay Tuned: A History of American Broadcasting; pp. 387‚Äì388; Christopher H. Sterling, John M. Kittross; Erlbaum, 2002; = Independent and educational stations = In the United States, UHF stations gained a reputation for local ownership, nonprofessional operations, small audiences and weak signal propagation. While UHF-TV was available to American TV broadcasters in today's form since 1952, affiliates of the 1950s four largest American TV networks (NBC, CBS, ABC, and DuMont) preferentially transmitted on VHF wherever it were available. All available VHF-TV allocations were already in use in most large TV markets by the mid-1950s, owing to FCC spacing rules to avoid co-channel and adjacent channel interference between VHF TV stations in the same or nearby cities. Two VHF TV stations on the same channel needed to be 160 or more miles apart, and two VHF TV stations on adjacent channel frequencies needed to be 60 or more miles apart. UHF stations in major population centers of the United States were usually either educational network or independent TV stations. The movie UHF (starring \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic and Michael Richards) parodied the independent UHF station phenomenon;U-62 program schedule, July 1989 a fictional UHF station was also parodied in 1980 film Pray TV. Some cities did develop successful independent UHF stations, many of these located in or near state capital cities, or served by nearby major rural regions. These included Montgomery, Alabama; Frankfort, Kentucky; Dover, Delaware; Lincoln, Nebraska; Topeka, Kansas; Jefferson City, Missouri; Lansing, Michigan; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Madison, Wisconsin; and Springfield, Illinois. In the United States, television stations in or near state capital cities are important because they closely covered the operations of state governments and spread information to residents across their state. TV antenna manufacturers often rated their top-of-the-line \\"deep-fringe\\" antenna models with phrases like \\"100 miles VHF/60 miles UHF\\" if the antenna included UHF reception at all. (In the practice of electrical engineering, the frequency range in which an antenna is to be used is an important factor in its design.) TV set manufacturers often treated UHF tuners as extra-charge optional-items until they became required. Various FCC attempts to protect UHF stations were met with mixed results. * Limits on the number of owned-and-operated stations controlled by one corporation were raised from five stations to seven, provided that two of them were UHF stations. Both NBC-TV (WBUF 17 Buffalo, WNBC 30 Hartford) and CBS-TV (WHCT 18 Hartford, WXIX 19 Milwaukee) acquired pairs of UHF stations as an experiment in the mid-1950s, only to abandon the stations in 1958‚Äì9. (NBC has since reacquired channel 30 in Hartford, now WVIT.) Their commercial network programming soon returned to VHF channel affiliates. WBUF's allocation on channel 17 was donated to the public-TV broadcaster WNED-TV, which now broadcasts as a Public Broadcasting Service station.Buffalo Broadcasters: History ‚Äì UHF * The UHF television impact policy (1960‚Äì1988) allowed applications for new VHF TV stations to be opposed in cases where licensure could lead to the economic failure of an existing UHF TV broadcaster. * The secondary affiliation rule (1971‚Äì1995) prohibited a network entering a market with two existing VHF TV network affiliates and one UHF independent TV station from placing its programs on a secondary basis on one or both VHF stations without offering them to the UHF station. * Limits on UHF effective radiated power, originally very restrictive, were relaxed. A UHF TV station could be licensed for up to five megawatts of carrier power, unlike VHF TV stations, which were limited to 100 (Channels 2‚Äì6) or 316 kilowatts of carrier power (Channels 7‚Äì13) depending on their channel. * More recent limits on station ownership are based on the combined percentage of the American population (originally 35% maximum, now increased to 45%) reached by one group of stations under common ownership. A UHF discount, by which only half of the audience of a UHF station would be counted against these limits, would ultimately allow groups such as PAX to reach the majority of the American audience using owned-and-operated UHF stations. The situation began to improve in the 1960s and 1970s, but progress was slow and difficult. While the smaller ABC-TV and DuMont Networks had a number of UHF affiliates, National Educational Television and its successor, PBS had even more. The original SIN (Spanish International Network) was established in 1962 as the predecessor of the modern Univision network. It was built primarily by UHF stations, such as KWEX-TV, Channel 41 in San Antonio and KMEX-TV, Channel 34 in Los Angeles. = Fourth networks, satellite and cable television = In 1970, Ted Turner acquired a struggling independent station on Channel 17 in Atlanta, Georgia, purchasing reruns of popular television shows, the Atlanta Braves baseball team and the Atlanta Hawks basketball team. This station, renamed WTBS, was uplinked in 1976 to satellite alongside new premium channels such as HBO, gaining access to distant cable television markets and becoming the first of various superstations to obtain national coverage. In 1986 Turner purchased the entire MGM film library. Turner Broadcasting System's access to movie rights proved commercially valuable as home video cassette rental became ubiquitous in the 1980s. In 1986, the DuMont owned-and-operated station group Metromedia was acquired by News Corporation and used as the foundation to relaunch a fourth commercial network, which obtained affiliations with many former big-city independent stations as Fox TV. Fox initially combined former independents and UHF stations. it had large programming budgets that the original DuMont lacked. Ultimately, it was able in some markets to draw existing VHF affiliates away from established Big Three networks, outbidding CBS for National Football Conference programming in 1994 and attracting many of that network's affiliates. Various smaller networks were created with the intent to follow in its footsteps, often by affiliating with a disparate collection of formerly independent UHF stations that otherwise would have no network programming. By 1994, New World Communications was moving its established stations from CBS to Fox affiliations in multiple markets, including WJBK-TV 2 Detroit. In many cases, this pushed CBS onto UHF; \\"U-62\\" as the new home of CBS in Detroit became CBS owned-and-operated station WWJ-TV in 1995, obtaining access to audiences thousands of miles distant through satellite and cable television. The concentration of media ownership, the proliferation of cable and satellite television and the digital television transition contributed to the quality equalization of VHF and UHF broadcasts. The distinction between UHF and VHF characteristics declined in importance with the emergence of additional broadcast television networks (Fox, The CW, MyNetworkTV, Univision, Telemundo, and ION), and the decline of direct OTA reception. The number of major large-city independent stations also declined as many joined or formed new networks. = Digital television = The majority of digital TV stations currently broadcast in the UHF band, both because VHF was already filled largely with analog TV when the digital facilities were built and because of severe issues with impulse noise on digital low-VHF channels. While virtual channel numbering schemes routinely display channel numbers like \\"2.1\\" or \\"6.1\\" for individual North American terrestrial HDTV broadcasts, these are more often than not actually UHF signals. Many equipment vendors therefore use \\"HDTV antenna\\" or similar branding as all but synonymous to \\"UHF antenna\\". Terrestrial digital television is based on a forward error correction scheme, in which a channel is assumed to have a random bit error rate and additional data bits may be sent to allow these errors to be corrected at the receiver. While this error correction can work well in the UHF band where the interference consist largely of white noise, it has largely proven inadequate on lower VHF channels where bursts of impulse noise disrupt the entire channel for short lengths of time. A short impulse-noise burst might be a minor annoyance to analog TV viewers, but due to the fixed timing and repetitive nature of analog video synchronization is usually recoverable. The same interference can prove severe enough to prevent the reliable reception of the more fragile and more highly compressed ATSC digital television. Power limits are also lower on low-VHF; a digital UHF station may be licensed to transmit up to a megawatt of effective radiated power. Very few stations returned to VHF channels 2‚Äì6 after the transition was completed in 2009, and were mainly concentrated in the Desert Southwest and Mountain West regions, where few geographical obstructions and adjoining co-channel stations exist. At least three quarters of all full-power digital broadcasts continued to use UHF transmitters, with most of the others located on the high-VHF channels. In some American markets, such as Syracuse, New York, no full- service VHF TV stations remained. The one remaining limitation of UHF is its greatly reduced range in the presence of terrain obstacles. This continues to adversely affect digital UHF TV reception. This limitation could potentially be overcome by the use of a distributed transmission system. Multiple digital UHF transmitters in carefully selected locations can be synchronized as a single-frequency network to produce a tailored coverage area pattern rivaling that of a single full-power VHF transmitter. Due to the inferiority of UHF broadcasting for analog television, the FCC counts the audience of UHF stations by half for the purposes of its national market share cap of 39%, a policy known as the UHF discount. The rule was briefly removed in September 2016, with the FCC citing that the rule was obsolete because almost all digital television channels are on the UHF band, and that the policy was being abused by broadcasters as a loophole to increase their market share. However, in April 2017, under new FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, the discount was reinstated. = UHF islands = One notable exception to historical patterns favoring VHF broadcasters has existed in television markets that could not qualify for their own VHF stations because they were sandwiched between the outer fringes of VHF stations in two or more larger markets. Such cities received only UHF licenses. With all stations (including network affiliates) on UHF, all-channel receivers and antennas became commonplace locally and UHF stations signing on as early as 1953 were often able to obtain the programming and audience needed to remain viable into the modern era.WSJV 28 South Bend, Indiana history indicates station founded 1954, still extant as no VHF channels available due to proximity to Chicago. These communities, known as UHF islands, included cities like Youngstown, Ohio; Tri-Cities, Washington; Springfield, Massachusetts; Elmira, New York; South Bend, Indiana; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Peoria, Illinois; Huntsville, Alabama; Salisbury, Maryland; Lexington, Kentucky; and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Other smaller cities such as Madison, Wisconsin; Bakersfield, California; Fresno, California; Fort Myers, Florida; Mankato, Minnesota; Watertown, New York; Erie, Pennsylvania; Columbia, South Carolina; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania only received one VHF license, meaning that any additional programming would need to be provided either by UHF, by distant stations, or by low-power broadcasting. The Bakersfield and Fresno markets originally had stations that operated on a VHF channel (KERO-TV on channel 10 and KFRE-TV on channel 12); those markets became UHF islands between 1961 and 1963 after the FCC initiated a deintermixture process, with KERO-TV moving to channel 23 and KFRE-TV moving to channel 30.\\"Vhf-to-uhf change approved for KERO-TV.\\" Broadcasting, November 19, 1962, pg. 78. \\"KFRE-TV moves to uhf; backed deintermixture.\\" Broadcasting, February 20, 1961, pg. 44. The allocations of the two channels that were vacated were reassigned to nearby markets; channel 10 would be reallocated to the Las Vegas, Nevada market as a fifth VHF channel (which would be used by KLVX when it signed on in 1968), while channel 12 would be reallocated to the Santa Barbara, California market as a third VHF channel (which would be used by KCOY-TV when it signed on in 1964). = Broadcast translators and low-power television = Very small UHF TV transmitters continue to operate with no programming or commercial identity, instead retransmitting signals of existing full-power stations to a smaller area poorly covered by the main VHF signal. Such transmitters are called \\"translators\\" rather than \\"stations\\". The smallest, owned by local municipal-level groups or the originating TV stations, are numbered sequentially ‚Äì W or K, followed by the channel number, followed by two sequentially issued letters, yielding a \\"translator callsign\\" in a generic format that appears K14AA through W69ZZ. Translators and repeaters also exist on VHF channels, but infrequently and with stringently limited power. The translator band, UHF TV channels 70‚Äì83, consisted mostly of these small repeaters; it was removed from television use in 1983 with the tiny repeaters moved primarily to lower UHF channels. The 806‚Äì890 MHz band segment is now used primarily by mobile phones. Many of these transmitters, if still in operation, were moved again in 2011 as UHF channels 52‚Äì69 were lost primarily to mobile telephony during the DTV transition, and a third time by 2020, when the 2016 wireless spectrum auction eliminated channels 37‚Äì51. As improvements to originating stations lessen the need for these translators, the small transmitter facilities and their allocated frequencies were often repurposed for low-power broadcasting; instead of repeating a distant signal, the tiny transmitter would be used to originate programming for a small local area.

in carbon fiber and powered by a Lamborghini engine, named \\"Centenaire\\". The company also produced a street legal Spyder (convertible car) named \\"Beau Rivage\\". Their supercar models have been developed and produced by ex- Lamborghini engineers and other Italian car designers with many prototypes built. As for 2016, nearly 60 cars were produced since the 1980s including prototypes many of them were models built intended both for racing and for roadgoing, mostly using Italian Lamborghini mechanicals and other Italian components. The local Montecarlo Motor Museum has its own display of all the MCA models that have been made including racing cars since the early 1980s, besides a large collection of other rare foreign exhibit featuring luxury models and other well-known sports cars. In 1993 the Centenaire V12 won its class in the six hours endurance of Vallelunga. In 1995, the Monte Carlo Automobile was acquired by the French Aixam Mega group, who built and sold some sportscars derived from the original MCA Centenaire, called MEGA Montecarlo V12 a new European supercar for the late 1990s that was equipped with a powerful Mercedes V12 unleaded petrol engine. Although several prototypes were made their promised production run never started and the company passed again back to its Italian founders.

This is a circle that is tangent to each of the polygon's sides. The dual polygon of a tangential polygon is a cyclic polygon, which has a circumscribed circle passing through each of its vertices. All triangles are tangential, as are all regular polygons with any number of sides. A well-studied group of tangential polygons are the tangential quadrilaterals, which include the rhombi and kites. Characterizations A convex polygon has an incircle if and only if all of its internal angle bisectors are concurrent. This common point is the incenter (the center of the incircle).Owen Byer, Felix Lazebnik and Deirdre Smeltzer, Methods for Euclidean Geometry, Mathematical Association of America, 2010, p. 77. There exists a tangential polygon of n sequential sides a1, ..., an if and only if the system of equations :x_1+x_2=a_1,\\\\quad x_2+x_3=a_2,\\\\quad \\\\ldots,\\\\quad x_n+x_1=a_n has a solution (x1, ..., xn) in positive reals. If such a solution exists, then x1, ..., xn are the tangent lengths of the polygon (the lengths from the vertices to the points where the incircle is tangent to the sides). Uniqueness and non-uniqueness If the number of sides n is odd, then for any given set of sidelengths a_1, \\\\dots , a_n satisfying the existence criterion above there is only one tangential polygon. But if n is even there are an infinitude of them.. For example, in the quadrilateral case where all sides are equal we can have a rhombus with any value of the acute angles, and all rhombi are tangential to an incircle. Inradius If the n sides of a tangential polygon are a1, ..., an, the inradius (radius of the incircle) isAlsina, Claudi and Nelsen, Roger, Icons of Mathematics. An exploration of twenty key images, Mathematical Association of America, 2011, p. 125. :r=\\\\frac{K}{s}=\\\\frac{2K}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i} where K is the area of the polygon and s is the semiperimeter. (Since all triangles are tangential, this formula applies to all triangles.) Other properties *For a tangential polygon with an odd number of sides, all sides are equal if and only if all angles are equal (so the polygon is regular). A tangential polygon with an even number of sides has all sides equal if and only if the alternate angles are equal (that is, angles A, C, E, ... are equal, and angles B, D, F, ... are equal).De Villiers, Michael. \\"Equiangular cyclic and equilateral circumscribed polygons,\\" Mathematical Gazette 95, March 2011, 102‚Äì107. *In a tangential polygon with an even number of sides, the sum of the odd numbered sides' lengths is equal to the sum of the even numbered sides' lengths.Du≈°an Djukiƒá, Vladimir Jankoviƒá, Ivan Matiƒá, Nikola Petroviƒá, The IMO Compendium, Springer, 2006, p. 561. *A tangential polygon has a larger area than any other polygon with the same perimeter and the same interior angles in the same sequence. *The centroid of any tangential polygon, the centroid of its boundary points, and the center of the inscribed circle are collinear, with the polygon's centroid between the others and twice as far from the incenter as from the boundary's centroid.

In the early Middle Ages, there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; it can be seen in the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of D√°l Riata suggests that it was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Insular art is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved high crosses found particularly in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of Iona. Scotland adopted the Romanesque style relatively late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items. Visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. Early Middle Ages =Pictish stones= The Dunnichen Stone, a Class I incised stone, with double disc and z-rod, mirror and comb and flower Pictish symbols About 250 Pictish stones survive and have been assigned by scholars to three classes.J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, Scotland, Archaeology and Early History (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), , pp. 161‚Äì5. Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus).J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , pp. 7‚Äì8. Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas. =Pictish metalwork= Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so. The very large hoard of late Roman hacksilver found at Traprain Law may have originated in either way. The largest hoard of early Pictish metalwork was found in 1819 at Norrie's Law in Fife, but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down.S. Youngs, ed., \\"The Work of Angels\\", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD (London: British Museum Press, 1989), , pp. 26‚Äì8. Over ten heavy silver chains, some over long, have been found from this period; the double- linked Whitecleuch Chain is one of only two that have a penannular ring, with symbol decoration including enamel, which shows how these were probably used as \\"choker\\" necklaces. The St Ninian's Isle Treasure of 28 silver and silver- gilt objects, contains perhaps the best collection of late Pictish forms, from the Christian period, when Pictish metalwork style, as with stone-carving, gradually merged with Insular, Anglo-Saxon and Viking styles.L. R. Laing, Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), , p. 37. =Irish-Scots art= The front of the Hunterston Brooch, found near Hunterston, North Ayrshire, which shows Irish elements of style and may have been made in the kingdom of D√°l Riata Thomas Charles-Edwards has suggested that the kingdom of D√°l Riata was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements.T. M. Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 331‚Äì2. This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the Hunterston brooch, found in Ayrshire, which may have been made in D√°l Riata, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which D√°l Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed.A. Lane, \\"Citadel of the first Scots\\", British Archaeology, 62, December 2001. Retrieved 2 December 2010. In the eighth and ninth centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular brooches with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish pseudo-penannular brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The eighth century Monymusk Reliquary has elements of Pictish and Irish style.S. Youngs, ed., \\"The Work of Angels\\", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD (London: British Museum Press, 1989), , pp. 109‚Äì113. =Early Anglo-Saxon art= Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.C. R. Dodwell, Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), , pp. 2‚Äì4. There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at Dalmeny Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with filigree and garnet, similar to sword harness mounts found at Sutton Hoo. There is also a bun-shaped loom from Yetholm, Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian runic inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword pommel from Culbin Sands, Moray and the Burghead drinking horn mount.L. Laing, The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400‚Äì1200 AD (London: Taylor & Francis, 1975), , p. 28. After Christianisation in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.C. E Karkov, The Art of Anglo-Saxon England (Boydell Press, 2011), , p. 5. =Insular art= The opening page from the Gospel of John from the Book of Kells, usually thought to have been made in Iona. Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art, is the name given to the common style produced in Scotland, Britain and Anglo-Saxon England from the seventh century, with the combining of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon forms.H. Honour and J. Fleming, A World History of Art (London: Macmillan), , pp. 244‚Äì7. Surviving examples of Insular art are found in metalwork, carving, but mainly in illuminated manuscripts. In manuscripts surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession. The best examples include the Book of Kells, which may have been wholly or partly created in Iona, and the Book of Durrow, which may be from Ireland or Northumbria. Carpet pages are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although historiated initials (an Insular invention), canon tables and figurative miniatures, especially Evangelist portraits, are also common. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.C. R. Dodwell, The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800‚Äì1200 (Yale UP, 1993), , pp. 85 and 90. Christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so the majority of examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned.C. R. Dodwell, Anglo-Saxon Art, a New Perspective (Manchester:Manchester University Press, 1982), , p. 4. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines (\\"cumdachs\\") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent‚Äîthough the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland.S. Youngs, ed., \\"The Work of Angels\\", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork (London: British Museum Press, 1989), , pp. 134‚Äì140. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops.S. Youngs, ed., \\"The Work of Angels\\", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork (London: British Museum Press, 1989), , pp. 15‚Äì16. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used.S. Youngs, ed., \\"The Work of Angels\\", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork (London: British Museum Press, 1989), , pp. 72‚Äì115, and 170‚Äì174 and D. M. Wilson, Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest (Overlook Press, 1984), pp. 113‚Äì114 and 120‚Äì130. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.R. G. Calkins, Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press 1983), pp. 57‚Äì60. The Monymusk Reliquary, made c. 750 The most significant survivals in sculpture are in High crosses, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition may have begun in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1‚Äì5 (ABC-CLIO, 2006), , pp. 915‚Äì19. They are found throughout the British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a Celtic cross, apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that may have begun at Iona.D. M. Wilson, Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest (Overlook Press), 1984, p. 118. Distribution in Scotland is heaviest in the Highlands and Islands and they can be dated to the period c. 750 to 1150. All the surviving crosses are of stone, but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed. In Scotland biblical iconography is less common than in Ireland, but the subject of King David is relatively frequently depicted. In the east the influence of Pictish sculpture can be seen, in areas of Viking occupation and settlement, crosses for the tenth to the twelfth centuries have distinctive Scandinavian patterns, often mixed with native styles. Important examples dated to the eighth century include St Martin's Cross on Iona, the Kildalton Cross from the Hebrides and the Anglo-Saxon Ruthwell Cross. Through the Hiberno-Scottish mission to the continent, insular art was highly influential on subsequent European Medieval art, especially the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic styles.G. Henderson, Early Medieval Art (London: Penguin, 1972), pp. 63‚Äì71. =Viking age art= Some of the Lewis chessmen Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries.J. Graham- Campbell and C. E. Batey, Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 34. Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 \\"pagan\\" burials in the north and west from the mid- ninth to the mid-tenth centuries.M. Carver, The Cross Goes North: Processes of Conversion in Northern Europe, AD 300‚Äì1300 (Boydell Press, 2006), , p. 219. These include jewellery, weapons and occasional elaborate high status items.J. Jesch, Women in the Viking Age (Boydell & Brewer, 1991), , p. 14. Amongst the most impressive of these is the Scar boat burial, on Orkney, which contained an elaborate sword, quiver with arrows, a brooch, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar Dragon Plaque, made from whalebone, most of which were probably made in Scandinavia.K. Holman, The Northern [I. E. Northern] Conquest: Vikings in Britain and Ireland (Signal Books, 2007), , p. 137. From the west, another boat burial at Kiloron Bay in Colonsay revealed a sword, shield, iron cauldron and enamelled scales, which may be Celtic in origin.L. Laing, The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400‚Äì1200 AD (London: Taylor & Francis, 1975), , p. 201. A combination of Viking and Celtic styles can be see in a penannular brooch from Pierowall in Orkney, which has a Pictish-style looped pin. It is about two inches in diameter, with traces of gilding, and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons.W. Nolan, L. Ronayne and M. Dunlevy, eds, Donegal: History & Society: Interdisciplinary Essays on the History of an Irish County (Geography, 1995), , p. 96. After the conversion to Christianity, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, stone crosses and cross-slabs in Viking occupied areas of the Highlands and Islands were carved with successive styles of Viking ornament.J. Koch, Celtic Culture: Aberdeen Breviary-Celticism (ABC-CLIO, 2006), . p. 918. They were frequently mixed with native interlace and animal patterns. Examples include the eleventh-century cross-slab from D√≥id Mh√†iri on the island of Islay, where the plant motifs on either side of the cross-shaft are based upon the Ringerike style of Viking art.J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey. Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 90. The most famous artistic find from modern Scotland, the Lewis Chessmen, from Uig, were probably made in Trondheim in Norway, but contain some decoration that may have been influenced by Celtic patterns.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 31. Late Middle Ages =Architecture and sculpture= Archibald, 5th earl of Douglas (1390‚Äì1439) in St Bride's Church, Douglas Architectural evidence suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked in much of Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland in the second half of the twelfth centuryR. N. Swanson, The Twelfth-Century Renaissance (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), , p. 155. and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the English perpendicular style that had come to dominate.T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 190. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France. The interiors of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish landscape, 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 117. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style.S. H. Rigby, A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (London: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), , p. 532. Monumental effigies began to appear in churches from the thirteenth century and they were usually fully coloured and gilded. Many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels, including members of the clergy, knights and often their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to brass etchings, they continued to be produced until the end of the Medieval period, with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century,R. Brydall, The Monumental Effigies of Scotland: From the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century (Kessinger Publishing, 1895, rpt. 2010) .K. Stevenson, Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424‚Äì1513 (Boydell Press, 2006), , pp. 125‚Äì8. including the very elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas. Sometimes the best continental artists were employed, as for Robert I's elaborate tomb in Dunfermline Abbey, which was made in his lifetime by the Parisian sculptor Thomas of Chartres, but of which only fragments now survive. The greatest group of surviving sculpture from this period are from the West Highlands, beginning in the fourteenth century on Iona under the patronage of the Lordship of the Isles and continuing until the Reformation. Common motifs were ships, swords, harps and Romanesque vine leaf tracery with Celtic elements.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 34‚Äì5. =Decorative arts= The 12th century \\"Loch Shiel Crozier Drop\\", hollow for a relic, with the bust of a king.V. Glenn, Romanesque and Gothic: Decorative Metalwork and Ivory Carvings in the Museum of Scotland (National Museums of Scotland, 2003), , pp. 105‚Äì106. Survivals from late Medieval church fittings and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even compared to those from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as Limoges enamels.Glenn, 1‚Äì4; Chapter III on enamels It is often difficult to decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles. Two secular small chests with carved whalebone panels and metal fittings illustrate some aspects of the Scottish arts. The Eglington and Fife Caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the caskets follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with \\"simple decorations of fleurons and debased egg and dart\\" while the whalebone panels are carved in relief with a late form of Insular interwoven strapwork characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.Glenn, 147, 186‚Äì191; both now Museum of Scotland Key examples of native craftsmanship on items include the Bute mazer, the earliest surviving drinking cup of its type, made of maple- wood and with elaborate silver-gilt ornamentation, dated to around 1320.Glenn, 34‚Äì38, and 16th century cover, 191‚Äì192 The Savernake Horn was probably made for the earl of Moray in the fourteenth century and looted by the English in the mid-sixteenth century.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 127‚Äì9. A few significant reliquaries survive from West Scotland, examples of the habit of the Celtic church of treating the possessions rather than the bones of saints as relics. As in Irish examples these were partly reworked and elaborated at intervals over a long period. These are St Fillan's Crozier and its \\"Coigreach\\" or reliquary, between them with elements from each century from the eleventh to the fifteenth, the Guthrie Bell Shrine, Iona, twelfth to fifteenth century, and the Kilmichael Glassary Bell Shrine, Argyll, mid-twelfth century.Glenn, 92‚Äì115, all Museum of Scotland; MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , p. 32. The Skye Chess piece is a single elaborate piece in carved walrus ivory, with two warriors carrying heraldic shields in a framework of openwork vegetation. It is thought to be Scottish, of the mid- thirteenth century, with aspects similar to both English and Norwegian pieces.Glenn, 146‚Äì147, 178‚Äì181; now Museum of Scotland One of the largest groups of surviving works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, beginning at the royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the Gaelicised areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401Glenn, 116‚Äì144; C. J. Neville, Land, Law and People in Medieval Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , pp. 83‚Äì99. and seal matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry. Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in Perth, the vestments and hangings in Holyrood and the Medieval maces of the Universities of St Andrews and Glasgow. =Illumination and painting= The Trinity Altarpiece, attributed to Flemish artist Hugo van der Goes for the Trinity College Kirk in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the late fifteenth century Manuscript illumination continued into the late Middle Ages, moving from elaborate gospels to charters, like that confirming the rights of Kelso Abbey from 1159.R. Brydall, Art in Scotland: its Origins and Progress (Edinburgh and London: Blackwood, 1889), p. 17. Very little painting from Scottish churches survives. There is only one surviving Doom painting in Scotland, at Guthrie near Arbroath, which may have been painted by the same artist as the elaborate crucifixion and other paintings at Foulis Easter, eighteen miles away.M. R. Apted and W. R. Robinson, \\"Late fifteenth century church painting from Guthrie and Foulis Easter\\", Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 95 (1964), pp. 262‚Äì79. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions, but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 57‚Äì9. Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included a fine portrait of William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen (1488‚Äì1514); the images of St Catherine and St John brought to Dunkeld; Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh, commissioned by James III, and the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named. There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons, including the prayer book commissioned by Robert Blackadder, Bishop of Glasgow, between 1484 and 1492 and the Flemish illustrated book of hours, known as the Hours of James IV of Scotland, given by James IV to Margaret Tudor and described as \\"perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use\\".D.

The work exists in two redactions: the first was composed after the siege of Calais in 1436 but before the end of 1438, and a second edition of the work before June 1441. This second edition was probably revised again.Frank Taylor has suggested a third edition (\\"Some Manuscripts of The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye\\"). Nineteen manuscripts contain the Libelle, which consists of about 1,100 lines in rhyming couplets, with a proem in rhyme-royal and a stanzaic envoi that differs between the poem's two editions.Sobecki, ‚ÄúBureaucratic Verse\\", 254.  Overview  The Libelle combines mercantilism with a jingoistic approach to England's neighbours. It recommends tight control of the British Sea and the Channel in particular to ensure prosperity and tranquility. Given England's waning fortunes in the Hundred Years War following Burgundy's alliance with France after the Treaty of Arras, the Libelle advocates a defence of the wool staple at Calais at any cost, besides \\"keeping\\" Wales and Ireland. This staunchly colonial position is complemented by a long list of European territories and countries with an inventory of their commodities. Finally, the poem complains about widespread piracy, the devaluation of English currency, and closes with a meditation on the value of peace.  Authorship  In 1926, George Warner attributed the poem to Adam Moleyns,Warner, The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye, xxxix-xlvi. Warner first attributed the poem to Moleyns in his review of Hertzberg‚Äôs 1878 edition which appeared in The Academy, 14 (1878), 491-92. but this theory was partly based on Warner's mistaken identification of Moleyns as a member of the family's Lancashire branch. Dismantled by G.A. Holmes in 1961, the theory of Moleyns's authorship has since been abandoned.Holmes, \\"The Libel of English Policy\\", 211-12. John Lydgate has also been proposed as the poem's author, but this theory has been rejected by Frank Taylor.Taylor, \\"Some Manuscripts\\", 414‚Äì18. Most recently, William Lyndwood, Keeper of the Privy Seal from 1432 to 1443 and the son of a wool merchant, has been associated with the poem's production.Sobecki, ‚ÄúBureaucratic Verse\\". In 2019, Sebastian Sobecki identified the author as Richard Caudray, Moleyn's immediate predecessor as clerk of the council who stepped down from this role in 1435 and was therefore best placed to compose this poem.Sobecki, Last Words, 101-26. Caudray's composition of the Book of the Council, his political views, and a further evidence points to his role behind the poem.Sobecki, Last Words, 101-26.  Reception  Although the poem did not alter foreign policy at the time, it became influential during the formulation of English mercantilism in subsequent centuries. The Paston family appears to have possessed a copy of the work in the fifteenth century. The Libelle was first printed by Hakluyt in the second edition of his Principall Navigations (1598-1600). Another prominent sixteenth-century owner was Elizabeth I's Lord High Treasurer, William Cecil (Lord Burghley). John Selden used the work to mount his case for closed seas in his Mare clausum (1635) and Samuel Pepys, clerk of the acts at the Navy Board, owned a copy, as did the influential seventeenth-century barrister Matthew Hale.Breeze, \\"Sir John Paston, Lydgate, and The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye\\", Lester, \\"The Books of a Fifteenth-Century English Gentleman\\", and Sobecki, ‚ÄúBureaucratic Verse\\" 254.  Critical approaches  Interpretation has focussed on the mercantile aspects of the poem. Carol Meale proposes that the poem's \\"composition was encouraged by mercantile patronage\\",Meale, \\"The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye and Mercantile Literary Culture\\", 216. whereas John Scattergood suggests that the poem's bullishly colonialist and protectionist outlook offers ‚Äúa redefinition of the nation‚Äù by reference to the ‚Äúspecific sectional interest‚Äù of merchants.Scattergood, \\"The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye: the Nation and its Place\\", 33. Sebastian Sobecki draws attention to the use of legal forms in the poem and its interest in documentary authenticity, placing the work in a bureaucratic government context.Sobecki, ‚ÄúBureaucratic Verse\\", passim. In his identification of Richard Caudray as the poem's author, Sobecki links the poem's production to Caudray's departure from the council in 1435 and appointment as chief secretary to John Holland, high admiral of England, Ireland, and Aquitaine, and later duke of Exeter.Sobecki, Last Words, 101-26  References   Editions  * Warner, George, ed, The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye: A Poem on the Use of Sea-Power, 1436 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1926) * Anthony Bale and Sebastian Sobecki, ed., The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye, in Bale and Sobecki, ed., Medieval English Travel: A Critical Anthology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2019), 303-51.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on September 27, 2001. Plot The episode begins where the previous episode left off, at the end of Monica and Chandler's wedding. Ross congratulates Monica on her pregnancy, only to be told that she is not pregnant. Phoebe asks Monica why she told him that, saying they found the pregnancy test. Spotting Rachel desperately shaking her head at her, Phoebe quickly decides to pretend it is hers and claims the father is James Brolin. At the wedding reception, Chandler surprises Monica by telling her that, in preparation for their first dance, he has been taking dancing lessons. However, when he tries, he finds his slippery new shoes make him utterly incapable of dancing. He asks Joey whether he can borrow his shoes, only to look down and realise that Joey is not a shoe size 11, as he claimed, but in fact a size 7. Monica finally manages to get Chandler onto the dance floor, saying it does not matter that he cannot dance traditionally, as long as she can dance on her wedding night with her husband. She tells him to keep his feet still, so he does not slip, and dance like that. Chandler starts tentatively, but rapidly gets into the \\"Chandler dance\\". He stops, though, when Jack enthusiastically tells him he is \\"stealing his moves.\\" Meanwhile, Phoebe quizzes Rachel on the identity of the father ‚Äì guessing at Tag, Ross and Joey. Rachel refuses to tell her until the father knows about the pregnancy. Monica, still unaware of the truth, discusses with Rachel how difficult it will be for Phoebe to be a single mother and lists the numerous problems she will have to face. Rachel agrees unenthusiastically and unthinkingly drinks some champagne, and then quickly spits it out again. Seeing this, Monica realises that it is Rachel who is pregnant. She punctures Phoebe's facade, and asks Rachel to take another test to make sure she is pregnant, saying it will be her wedding present. Chandler's mother introduces her date, Dennis Phillips, a famous Broadway producer. Joey, who has changed from his army costume into a tennis outfit (the only thing they had in the hotel shop), is very excited about this. Joey asks Chandler to put a word in for him with Dennis, and later on in the reception, Joey gets up on stage to do a speech that is tailored, increasingly unsubtly, to show off his dramatic skills to Dennis. He then approaches Dennis about getting an audition for his newest play, but Dennis says it is an all Chinese cast. Whilst collecting table placings, Ross meets Mona, a colleague of Monica's. He flirts with her, complimenting her on her name, and when she leaves, he switches his table so he can sit with her, only to discover that he switched onto the wrong table ‚Äì he has in fact seated himself at the children's table. Ross asks Mona to dance, but a little girl from his table asks him whether he can dance with her. Mona says she can have the first dance, and Ross, looking to impress Mona, dances with the girl standing on his shoes. He then dances with multiple young girls, but when Ross thinks he can dance with Mona, he is surprised when Gert, a significantly larger girl than the ones he has previously danced with, insists it is her turn to dance on his shoes. Rachel, Monica and Phoebe get together in the washroom to discover the result of Rachel's second pregnancy test. The wait seems endless for Rachel, whilst Monica tells her that they will be there for her whatever the result. Finally, Phoebe tells Rachel that the result is negative. To her surprise, Rachel reacts sadly. She wonders how she can be sad about losing something she never had. Phoebe then tells her that it was positive ‚Äì she had lied in order for Rachel to find out how she really felt about having a baby. An overjoyed Rachel decides she is going to have the baby, and hugs Phoebe and Monica in celebration. At the end of the reception, Joey helps Ross ‚Äì who has been injured by weight of Gert ‚Äì off the dance floor. Mona compliments him on this, saying he is one of the few nice guys left in the world. Ross, spotting Joey gearing up to flirt, reacts angrily saying he is the nice guy, having to dance all night with children for the attention of Mona. Bent over in pain, Ross too realises how small Joey's feet are.

Description The building was constructed 1861‚Äì1870 and was designed by architect/builders Ebenezer Hanks, Edward Dalton and William A. Warren, all members of the local community. The basement was completed by 1867 when it began to hold meetings. The first meeting held in the relatively large chapel, which seated 800, occurred when LDS Church leader Brigham Young visited in April 1870. The building has two separate staircases with entrances, originally one for males and one for females. The building was abandoned by the church after 1914 when the new adjacent Prairie School styled Parowan 3rd Ward Meetinghouse was built on the same lot. Somewhere around 1920, ownership was taken over by the city, who turned over the building to the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers who retain caretaker status.

Its site is within the bounds of the modern village of . Cytinium was more frequently mentioned in history than the other towns of the Tetrapolis owing to its situation, which rendered it a place of great military importance. The position of the town, commanding the northern entrance of the pass leading from the valley of Doris to the plain of Amphissa, illustrates the intended expedition of Demosthenes from Naupactus in 426 BCE. This commander proposed, if he had been successful over the Aetolians, to have marched through the Locri Ozolae, leaving Parnassus on the right, to Cytinium in Doris, and from thence to have descended into Phocis, whose inhabitants were to have joined him in invading Boeotia. When Eurylochus, the Spartan general, shortly after the failure of the expedition of Demosthenes, was about to march from Delphi against Naupactus, he deposited at Cytinium the hostages he had received from the Locrians.

It is known from finds in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, and Uzbekistan. Taxonomy Puppigerus was described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1870. As of 1997, P. camperi and P. crassicostata were considered the two valid species. P. camperi was later thought to be the sole species of the genus until the 2005 discovery of P. nessovi from Uzbekistan. Description Restoration of P. camperi Fossils show that Puppigerus was around long, and its weight has been estimated as being somewhere around . Although cheloniids such as Puppigerus first appeared during the Cretaceous, several traits of this genus give it more of a resemblance to modern cheloniids: its \\"huge\\" eyes pointed sideways rather than upward, unlike more primitive cheloniids, and its shell was completely ossified. The pygal (rearmost plate of the upper shell) also lacked the notch seen in earlier cheloniids. It was a herbivore, living on marine vegetation, and one of the \\"best-adapted\\" prehistoric turtles; its \\"unusually large\\" eyes helped it gather as much light as possible, and its specialized jaw structure kept it from accidentally breathing in water. Its front legs were flipper-like, but its hind legs were not developed in this manner, suggesting it would have spent considerable time on dry land, where females would have laid their eggs. Palaeoecology Puppigerus camperi is known from the London Clay and Bracklesham Beds of England, as well as the Sables de Bruxelles and the Sables de Wemmel of Belgium. P. nessovi is known from the Dzheroi 2 locality of Uzbekistan. A Puppigerus species is also known from the Fur Formation of Denmark.

It later expanded into radio and television networks. As a radio network it was a heated competitor of the RHC-Cadena Azul network. Founding The company was founded on March 12, 1933, by Miguel Gabriel and √Ångel Camb√≥. Ten years later, on August 1, 1943, half of it was acquired by the business group of Goar Mestre. In the beginning, it transmitted only in the capital expanding later to the rest of the country. Pre-revolutionary Cuba was an early adopter of new technology, including TV. Cuba was the first Latin American country to have television. In December 1946 station CM-21P conducted an experimental multi- point live broadcast. Regular commercial broadcasting began in October 1950 with Gaspar Pumarejo's Uni√≥n Radio TV. This was followed by Goar Mestre Espinosa's CMQ-TV on channel 6 on December 18, 1950. CMQ officially launched on March 11, 1951, and would become an NBC affiliate. By 1954, CMQ-TV had expanded into a seven station network.

Life Grenald was born in 1928 in Louisville, Kentucky as Raymond Greenwald. He attended DuPont Manual High School, graduating in two-and-a-half years rather than the usual four. He then attended the University of Cincinnati until he enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1946. At the conclusion of his army service, he attended Washington State University on the GI Bill, majoring in Aeronautical Engineering. He worked for Boeing in that capacity, and also served in the Army during the Korean War era. He then returned to school to get a degree in Architecture at the University of Washington. Career Following graduation, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and became a practicing architect for the next 14 years. In that capacity, he won international recognition for his lighting designs, and in 1968 opened his own firm specializing in architectural lighting design. The move would make him one of the founding members of a new profession. He also became one of the founders of the International Association of Lighting Designers (IALD) in 1969. During his career he has served as president of the IALD and is currently on the board of directors for the National Lighting Research Organization. A long-time observer of people's cultural habits, Grenald's conversations are packed with recollections of the places he's visited and the spaces he's experienced and designed, and the phenomenon of how people see. He was elected to the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects in 1985, is a founder and past president of the IALD, and has chaired the IES's national committee on museum and art lighting. Long active in professional education, Grenald has served as a faculty member or visiting lecturer at more than a dozen major universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, Yale University, the University of Southern California, and the Moore College of Art, and has been a board member of the Lighting Research Institute. Lighting design firm Grenald founded his own lighting design firm, Grenald Associates, in Philadelphia in 1968. In 1994, it became Grenald-Waldron Associates with the elevation of Lee Waldron to partner. Awards * IALD 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award * Fellow, American Institute of Architects * Fellow, International Association of Lighting Designers * Fellow, Illuminating Engineering Society Projects of note * Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico Grenald redesigned the entire system, using lamp color and distribution characteristics to render the cave's scale and depth. Lighting intensity was gradually reduced so visitors could adapt to the Cavern's lower levels, while lamp color brought out the natural contrasts of the stone walls. Lighting was used to alternately reinforce the immense scale of the caverns and highlight the restrictions of space. * Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C. Relit the thoroughfare stretching from the Capitol to the White House as part of a project from 1976 to 1996, sponsored by The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation. The lighting worked to bring out the significance of the boulevard that could be enjoyed by tourists and become an important destination for tourists and locals alike. * Boathouse Row, Philadelphia Created evening lighting to bring out the beauty of the Victorian-era boathouses and their reflection on the Schuylkill River. The site, once slated for destruction, is now an important Philadelphia landmark. * Locust Walk, University of Pennsylvania An important component of the University of Pennsylvania's master plan to illuminate the campus at night and make it a safe and attractive destination for students. It also involves lighting the architecturally important Furness Building * Liberty Bell Pavilion, Philadelphia This building has housed the Liberty Bell since 2004, and Grenald headed the team that designed the museum's exterior and interior areas. * Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts An important building designed by Frank Furness, Grenald designed lighting during the building's centennial to bring out the beauty of Furness's original designs and enhance the use of the space as a museum and school. * The White House, Washington, D.C.

After another associate of Sivle's has been killed right under his eyes, the police arrest the courier. To his surprise, he is soon released and finds out that his unrequested client works for the FBI. The courier visits him at home and learns that the suitcase is from Russia and that the FBI considers it the only chance to get to Evil Sivle, who is an infamous assassin. The FBI agent also points out that Evil Sivle is about to turn tables with the courier. Sivle orders a duo of assassins to kill Stitch and Anna. The assassins kill Stitch. As the courier and Anna mourn his loss, the assassins attack them. The courier bugs the assassins. The FBI agent gets to Anna and convinces her to leak information about the courier's progress on the promise that the FBI can help fix the mess.

During this time he claimed to have visited Timbuktu, which would have made him the first Westerner to reach the city, though his narrative is dubious. Upon his stated liberation, and return to Europe, Adams' story was published in two heavily edited and divergent accounts, most notably The Narrative of Robert Adams in 1816. Because his story was sanctioned by some of the most distinguished men in England, including members of government, who had a noted financial interest in Africa, his narrative(s) gained credibility despite \\"its most glaring absurdities.\\" Widely cited as an example of white slavery, and having inspired Robinson Crusoe today both accounts are widely known to have been fabrications, lending to the dismissal of Adam's story within general history discussions and recordings. Early life Robert Adams was an American of mixed black and white ancestry. It was written that he was \\"born up the river of New York, where his father lived when he quitted America;\\" and that his mother was a Mulatto. However, there is no record of a man under either of his known aliases, or fitting his general description, in Hudson during this period. Joseph Dupuis, the British Consul in Mogador who eventually ransomed Adams, wrote of Adams' appearance: Dupuis wrote that Adams left America to avoid being prosecuted for refusing to legitimize his relationship with a young woman. However, nothing else is known of his early life until 1810 when, under the name \\"Benjamin Rose,\\" he signed onto the ship Charles as a merchant seaman. While he used the name \\"Benjamin Rose\\" leading up to his time on the Charles, he exclusively went by name, \\"Robert Adams,\\" after his release from slavery. It is not known which, if either of these names was his real one, though at the time it was not uncommon for sailors, especially \\"distressed seamen\\", to change their names. Adventure =Shipwreck= As Adams recounts in his Narrative, the ship sailed from New York City on June 17, 1810 (or May 7, 1810, as he recounted in Cadiz) led by captain, John Horton. The ship, carrying flour, rice, and salted provisions, was bound to Gibraltar. Along with Adams, the crew included Stephen Dolbie (mate), Thomas Williams, Martin Clarke, Unis Newsham, Nichofas (a Swede), John Stephens, John Matthews, and James Davison. Adams stated that, after 26 days, the ship arrived at Gibraltar, where the cargo was discharged. There, the crew added another crewman, Unis Nelson. According to Adams, the ship sat in Gibraltar for about a month, and proceeded after Captain Horton decided to go to the Isle of May for salt. However, it soon became clear that the captain was, rather, going on a trading voyage down the coast. After three weeks at sea, Adam said he overheard two of the older crew members ‚Äì Newsham and Matthews ‚Äì who were old and had been on the coast before, state that the Captain was lost. For eight or nine days, after that, the ships fought heavy winds until, on October 11, around 3:00am, the ship struck some reef in Cape Blanco...about four hundred miles north of Senegal. Despite two members of the crew being unable to swim, no lives were lost. =Life as a slave= As day broke, Adams claims the entire crew was surrounded by a group of about 35 Moors, who imprisoned them. Luckily, the Moors also had an imprisoned Frenchmen who was able to communicate with Captain Horton, who also spoke French. The crew, according to Adams, was stripped naked and forced to dig holes in the sand in order to sleep, so they could keep cool. Adams claimed that Captain Horton fell ill, and was killed with a sword by the Moors, who were frustrated that they could not communicate with him, despite having the Frenchman as a translator. Robert Adams said that, across three years of being enslaved in northern Africa, he passed through the hands of at least five different owners. His first owners were the Moors, who captured the shipwrecked sailors of the Charles. After about 12 days, after the shipwreck, Adams said that the Moors divided the prisoners among themselves, with Adams and Newsham being assigned to about twenty Moors who traveled on foot, with four camels. He said they traveled southwest, crossing the desert at an estimated rate of 15‚Äì20 miles a day, under great hardship, with scarcity of both food and water. He claimed they were often forced to drink a mix of water and camel urine just to stay alive in the parched conditions. At one point in the journey, Stevens says that his group of Moors was overtaken by a larger group of black Africans, who took the Moors and the slaves as prisoners, including Adams. They again traveled great distances, first to the Africans' village. According to Adams' account, he and a Portuguese slave, 18-year-old John Stevens, were taken to Timbuktu in around July 1812. Adams never provides any parameters for Steven's captivity, but expresses that they were treated as honored guests of the king rather than as slaves, and were free to move about as they pleased within the city. They were considered an exotic oddity by the locals, and Adams later recounts that people used to come from far off lands to stare at them. Eventually, Adams' stay as a guest came to a close, and he was traded to a group of Moors who sold tobacco. Several days after making their trade, Adams set off farther east, and eventually north, with his third group of captors. Adams suffered his second great desert crossing, once again drinking camel urine to survive and avoid dehydration. Eventually the Moors reached a village of tents, where Adams was put to work for several months tending goats and sheep. At some point during this phase of his enslavement, Adams' master had promised to take him all the way to Mogador and trade him to the British consul, thus helping him attain freedom. However, his master later went back on his word and Adams rebelled as a result, refusing to care for the animals. This angered his master, who later sold him to someone else. Adams' stated that his fourth master was a man with two wives. Adams was given to one of the wives as her personal slave. Some time later, the second wife enlisted the assistance of Adams to care for her goats. In payment, she allowed Adams to ‚Äúrest‚Äù in her tent. This relationship continued for months and, upon his master's knowledge of the affair, Adams was traded for blankets and dates. His fifth master took him farther north to a village settlement where he met other Westerners, including some of his former companions from the Charles. One of the white men had already renounced his Christian faith to attain freedom and, shortly after, two of his sailing companions from the Charles also renounced their faith. Not long after, the British consul, Joseph Dupuis, ransomed Adams, thus securing his freedom. =Freedom= After trading for Adams, the British consul Dupuis took him first to Agadir, then to Mogador, where Adams stayed for nearly seven months. It was here that he first appeared in the historical record, with the date October 6, 1813. From here, he was sent north to Tangier, to the American Consul-General, James Simpson. After this, Adams sailed to Cadiz, Spain, where he hoped to connect with a ship headed for the United States. Unfortunately, he arrived two days late. There he recounted his story to the American Samuel A. Storrow, who eventually published this \\"Cadiz Narrative\\" in 1817. Subsequently, Adams went to Gibraltar, where he was able to travel by ship to Holyhead on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales. Adams later ended up in London, where he survived as a beggar. In November 1815, Adams was sought out by Simon Cock of the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa, who had been led to him by a traveler who recognized Adams from Cadiz. Intrigued by the prospect of speaking to someone who had been to Timbuktu, Cock brought Adams to the Company's office. There, Adams agreed to recount his story in exchange for finances and security to travel home to New York. Cock and company questioned Adams and assembled a narrative of this account; it was published as The Narrative of Robert Adams in 1816. Narratives Two versions of Adams' story were published. The Company of Merchants Trading to Africa (aka the African Company) published the first version based on interviews held with Adams at their London offices. This version was titled The Narrative of Robert Adams and included an introduction, notes, and other supporting material. Simon Cock was its primary editor and Joseph Dupuis added notes based on his encounter with Adams. The book was published by John Murray in 1816. The Narrative is reminiscent of Barbary slave narratives, which were written by other shipwrecked sailors who had been taken captive and enslaved in Northern Africa (he was not captured by Barbary corsairs, and he spent his captivity in the Sub-Saharan region south of the Barbary coast). The one notable difference in the Narrative of Robert Adams is that Adams describes his visit to the legendary city of Timbuktu, much coveted by Europeans in that time. Adams was the first Westerner to ever give a full account of the city of Timbuktu. As Frank T. Kryza writes, \\"No European explorer had been there and returned since the Middle Ages.\\" According to Cock's introduction to the Narrative, Adams sailed home in December 1815, omitting much of his payment as well as his royalties from the book, but promising to return in the spring. Due to the dangerous nature of trans-Atlantic crossings in the winter, he gave Cock the \\"particulars of his family\\" to verify claims on his earnings. However, the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa's records do not show any money was ever paid to, or held for, Adams or his family. From this point, Adams vanishes from the historical record. The second version, known as the \\"Cadiz Narrative\\", was written up by Samuel A. Storrow, a \\"gentleman of Boston\\" who Adams met in Cadiz. This version was published as \\"Interiour of Africa\\" in the North American Review in May 1817, with an introductory note from editor Jared Sparks. In July 1817 Sparks wrote a review of the African Company's version, noting the discrepancies between the Cadiz account and the London version and calling Adams' tale a \\"fiction.\\" Significance The legends of the gold of Timbuktu spread after Mansa Musa, King of the Empire of Mali, set out in the year 1324 on a hajj, or journey to Mecca, showering gold on everyone he met. Ibn Battuta, famed Moroccan traveler, visited Mali for several months from 1352-1353 and confirmed an abundant supply of gold in the kingdom. These accounts spread throughout Africa and Europe, with many European countries coveting gold from the Malian city. The only people not looking for Timbuctoo were the Americans, because the United States was such a young country at that time. Timbuktu was at the time a major center of trading, with a focus on salt, books, and gold, which were all very in-demand at the time. Goods coming the Mediterranean shores and salt Tegaza in the north were traded in Timbuktu for gold, which came from the immense gold mines of the Boure and Banbuk. The prosperity of the city attracted both black African and Arab scholars, merchants and traders from all over North Africa. The fact that the city was a major center for trading goods for gold only increased its fame, and it was this very trade that made the city enormously wealthy. Many failed expeditions to the remote city of Timbuktu were attempted by the following explorers: the American John Ledyard, the Englishman Simon Lucas, the Irishman Major Daniel Houghton, the Scotsman Mungo Park, the German Frederick Hornemann, an Englishman named Nicholls, and the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. They all failed in one way or another, mostly by either disappearing in the middle of the expedition or by dying before reaching the city. Most did not return home. Robert Adams' tale of his visit to Timbuktu was highly significant for two reasons: (1) being a tale of a westerner finally managing to arrive at the famed city, long coveted for its supposed wealth and extensive reserves of gold, and (2) because he was said to have arrived there by accident, and not through an organized exploration. Despite the controversy regarding the veracity of Adams' story, the publication of his Narrative was deemed a triumph for British science and exploration. Though, Adams was said to have been an American, his tale was told in England, and it was there that the Narrative was published, granting an international victory to England. In contemporary times, Adams' tales is often cited as an example as white slavery; however given he was stated as being mulatto in his tale, due there is no record accounting for him or his family on either side of the Atlantic, and due to numerous other discrepancies in his tale, his story is accepted as having been fabricated. Controversy Adams' account does not match what is now known of Timbuktu, and is regarded as a probable fabrication. No trace has ever been found of either Adams or his family. In fact, no family, of his name, was known in the Hudson, nor had Adams ever been heard of in the area. In addition, the collector of New York, which certified ship, verified that no vessel resembling Adams' description of the Charles had ever left his stated port. Lending to doubts in Adams' story was also the fact that he had no firm national, racial, personal, language, or name identity, allowing him to pass through his own story, unnoticed e.g. he is both \\"Robert Adams\\" and \\"Benjamin Rose,\\" he speaks English, Arabic and \\"Negro.\\" There are also various noted holes in Adams' story. For example, there is no reason given for why he was allowed to roam Timbuktu freely for six months. It is also noted that Adams was induced, by Simon Cock, to answer questions about the region that had stumped Europeans for generations. He had an answer to every question he was asked by the Europeans. Raising more doubt is the manner in which Cock \\"found\\" Adams, a then destitute beggar, wandering the streets of London in 1815, and how an illiterate person, who learned nothing from books, knew the exact number of days of his journeys, the precise number of miles he traveled each day, and the precise directions of all his travels on foot. It is notable that it was a well-established fact that no wrecks occurred south of Cape Bajado at that time. In addition, Adams' illiteracy is at odds with the fact that sailors were substantially literate during this period. Also, lending to doubt of Adams' story, is the \\"artlessness,\\" considered necessary for poor storytellers, which often give them the feel of truth. Michel de Certeau wrote of such narratives when he linked the history of writing history to the legitimization of political power, a practice found in \\"Western\\" cultures which used the act of writing as a tool of colonialism; writing their own histories while minimizing or eradicating the traditions of native peoples. For example, Dick said of Adams: Adams, is painted by critics as a \\"found narrator,\\" who is not only unable to narrate a ‚Äúcontinuous and straight-forward story,‚Äù but who also could only answer questions put to him, first by Dupuis in 1810 in Africa, and then in 1815-16 in London, meaning the editors constructed his ‚Äústory‚Äù from fragments. This, argues critics, was done to the point in which Cock brought in a group of ‚Äúscientific and respectable gentleman‚Äù to interview Adams, in order to verify details and geographical descriptions of Africa. Adams' story was deemed to be obviously fabricated, to the point in which it was denounced in the North American Review, in 1817, which delivered its critique only after assessing both narratives. The critique stated: Despite its discrepancies, it is surmised that Adam's story found an audience due to \\"sympathy and curiosity of Africa\\" at the time.\\"  See also  * James Riley (captain) References  Further reading  *The Narrative of Robert Adams, a sailor, who was wrecked on the western coast of Africa, in the year 1810, was detained three years in slavery by the Arabs of the Great Desert, and resided several months in the city of Tombuctoo.

With the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the Bambisanani Partnership has used sport as a catalyst to develop international understanding, education, health and leadership. The initiative, which began in 2006, has gained both national and international acclaim. The Nkandla region is in the heart of Zululand and is extremely deprived with 90 per cent unemployment, 60 per cent adult illiteracy and one of the highest AIDS rates in the world with one in three adults infected. 20 percent of children never go to school, many unable to afford the school fees and uniform costs.Wharfedale Observer - Menston school's efforts give children in poverty a chance Mnyakanya High School was opened by Nelson Mandela and Jacob Zuma in 2004. The school serves a vast area and many students walk two hours to and from school each day. Class sizes are in excess of 60 and the school has very limited resources. Mnyakanya has over 850 students. History The road to Mnyakanya High School, Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Many pupils walk for several hours. The Bambisanani Partnership began in 2006 when David Geldart, Assistant Headteacher at St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston first visited Mnyakanya High School. In 2007, David Geldart returned to Mnyakanya with two Sixth form pupils. The purpose of the week-long visit was to conduct joint leadership training with South African learners, sport assistants, educators and volunteers.KwaZulu Natal Department of Sport and Recreation - United Kingdom and South Africa School Linkage Programme In 2008, St. Mary's was visited by Ina Cronje, Minister of Education, Kwa-Zulu Natal.Wharfedale Observer - Menston school is host to African visitors Bambisanani Enterprises, a social enterprise was established in 2009.

He founded the Sherwood Music School, which was acquired by Columbia College Chicago in 2007. Family history and early life Sherwood was born on January 31, 1854 in Lyons, New York to Reverend Lyman H. Sherwood and Mary Balis Sherwood. Sherwood's paternal grandfather was a judge and a Senator and his grandmother, who was also a skilled musician, had ancestry traces back to the English nobility. Mary Balis Sherwood was a well-educated woman, born near Catskill, New York where she grew up in a home that had been given to her great-grandfather for service in the Revolutionary War. Lyman H. Sherwood was an Episcopal minister, a college professor, and a talented musician. In 1854, the year of William Hall Sherwood's birth, his father left the ministry to pursue his interests in music further by opening the second incorporated music school in the United States, the Lyons Musical Academy in Lyons, New York. At age nine, Sherwood began attending this school and learning piano. Due to his rapid progression, Sherwood began teaching younger students at the Lyons Musical Academy in 1866. Music instruction abroad During the summer of 1871, Sherwood took five weeks of piano lessons with the American composer and pianist, William Mason. Recognizing Sherwood's talent, Mason encouraged him to study piano in Europe. Sherwood first traveled to Berlin, Germany with his father, where he began piano studies with Theodor Kullak. Kullak criticized the limitations of Sherwood's small hands and expressed concern that he would not do great legato octave work. Recognizing this challenge, Sherwood drafted his own manipulations of the joints within his thumbs, practiced slowing and accurately, and over time was able to successfully demonstrate his octave exercises to Kullak. During the winter of 1871, Sherwood moved to Stuttgart due to health problems, where he simultaneously studied composition with Carl Doppler and worked as the organist at the English Church at Stuttgart. After about six months, he returned to Berlin to study more with Kullak, and he began music theory and composition studies with Carl Friedrich Weitzmann, piano lessons with Ludwig Deppe, and counterpoint and composition lessons with Ernst Friedrich Richter. During this time, Sherwood began composing some piano pieces and was encouraged to begin performing them in Weimar and Hamburg. Sherwood's most successful and popular concert recognition comes after the 1872‚Äì1873 winter season, when he performed Ludwig van Beethoven‚Äôs ‚ÄúEmperor‚Äù Concerto, No. 5 in E-flat major with the Berlin Orchestra. This concert was so successful that it was repeated under the direction of Richard W√ºerst before thousands of audience members. During this time, Sherwood was introduced to one of Kullak's other students, Mary Neilson Fay (born 1855), originally from Williamsburg, New York. Fay was an accomplished pianist in her own right, having excelled under a number of piano teachers in America and Germany and moving on to public performances. In 1874, Sherwood and Fay married; they had three children together. Sherwood and Fay spent about six months in Weimar, Germany where they had the privilege of hearing and studying under the guidance of Franz Liszt, whom offered to act as their eldest daughter's godfather. Return to United States Sherwood and Fay returned to the United States in May 1876, where Sherwood began working as a faculty member at the New England Conservatory of Music. He began his American concert debut as the soloist with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Throughout the next couple of years, Sherwood and Fay toured together, performing in a variety of American cities. However, their marriage ended in divorce, and Fay even sued Sherwood for child support in April 1886 after he had neglected to pay on an order from November 1885. In 1887, Sherwood married one of his former students, Estelle F. Abrams of Monongahela, Pennsylvania; they had two children together. Music educator During the summer of 1889, Sherwood began holding workshops and lessons for piano teachers at the Chautauqua Institution‚Äôs summer Music School Festival. Sherwood continued to travel back to Chautauqua every summer to provide instruction at the camp, until the summer of 1910 before his death. In Fall 1889, Sherwood and his wife moved to Chicago, Illinois as he became the Director of the Pianoforte Department in the newly established School for Music and Dramatic Art within the Conservatory of Music. In 1895, Sherwood left his position at the Conservatory of Music to establish his own school, the Sherwood Music School, at the Fine Arts Building in Chicago, Illinois (now a part of Roosevelt University). While managing his own school, Sherwood also acted as a piano faculty member for the Siegel-Myers Correspondence School of Music. In 1906, Sherwood began writing lesson plans, exercises, studies, and compositions for piano for distance students learning piano methods by mail order. Siegel-Myers advertised this as an opportunity for their students to learn from ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äôs Foremost Pianist.‚ÄùSchool information booklet, 1910‚Äì1911 for Siegel-Myers Correspondence School of Music.

It was among the first Municipal Advisory Councils of California, elected representative bodies created in 1970/1971 in certain localities in response to race riots. Background The State of California created a new special form of local government agency in 1970 with the creation of Municipal Advisory Councils, legislation enacted in response to the increasing frequency of violent race riots and other disturbances in its urban settings. The new legislation was intended to empower local unincorporated communities and their involvement in policy decisions resulting in the provision of standard municipal services in areas distant to elected officials and seats of local government.California Local Government Code, Section 11560 et seq., Municipal Advisory Councils First Municipal Advisory Councils Among the first counties in the State to enable Municipal Advisory Councils (MACs) were Santa Barbara and San Mateo, which set up Councils in Isla Vista and in East Palo Alto in response to extensive riots in these unincorporated areas. These two MAC's became the most well-known examples in the State of this new form of quasi-representative government. The Isla Vista Municipal Advisory Council held its first election in early 1971 with nine local residents of the student community elected to the government with funding from the County of Santa Barbara to finance its operations. The new Council members elected were a mix of University students, local property owners and owners of commercial outlets, although this mix of residents is not legally mandated. In the same year, the County formed another special district with the creation of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District.Santa Barbara News-Press archives, 1971 Isla Vista Recreation & Park District The state legislation authorized the election of local community members in specified unincorporated areas of counties and the placement of such elections on the official ballot as well community issues to be voted on in a plebiscite. Upon election of nine residents, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors appointed the same members, by official resolution, to the open seats on Isla Vista Municipal Advisory Council (IVMAC) for a one-year term. Six of the seats were determined by district elections while three remaining positions were at-large seats. Council members were eligible for re- election and re-appointment Council members were first elected to the Isla Vista Community Council. The enabling State legislation also provided for local plebiscites on planning, land use and economic development issues of community importance.\\"Isla Vista Archives\\". SBHC Mss.41.

Early life He was the only son of Henry Grey, 3rd (6th) Baron Grey of Codnor, and Margaret Percy, daughter of Sir Henry Percy and Elizabeth Bardolf, daughter of William Bardolf, 4th Baron Bardolf. After her first husband's death Margaret remarried Sir Richard de Vere, younger son of John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, and died in 1464.Burke's Peerage 107th Edition 2003 Vol. 2 p.1666 He was only nine when his father died. In 1461 he fought for Henry VI at the Second Battle of St. Albans; but after the Yorkist victory at the Battle of Towton he was rapidly pardoned, as a part of Edward IV's effort to secure widespread support among the nobility.Ross p.67 Career He was one of the principal magnates in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and like many nobles of the time, he was prepared to assert his power by force, and even to act in open defiance of the law.Ross p.119 In 1467 a serious feud erupted between Lord Grey and the Vernon family, in which one of the Vernons was killed. The King appointed a particularly strong commission of oyer and terminer headed by his brother George, Duke of Clarence, to restore order in the region. The commission does not seem to have reached a verdict, and the following year Grey and the Vernons were made to swear oaths not to intimidate the jurors appointed to investigate the matter. One difficulty in settling the feud was that while the Duke of Clarence favoured the Vernons, the King was said to favour Grey.Ross p.119 The King was prepared to tolerate a certain amount of law-breaking by members of the nobility, since his own power depended on their support, but his patience had its limits, and in 1471 Grey was charged with inciting a serious riot in Nottingham. He was summoned before Star Chamber, where the King personally questioned him about his links to the rioters. At the end of the hearing the King strictly ordered Grey not to favour or maintain any malefactors in the town of Nottingham.Ross p.303 Grey's record of law-breaking was one of the reasons for the passage of an Act of Parliament in 1468,8 Edward IV c.2 declaring illegal the practice of retaining, i.e. the maintenance of a private army. Although proceedings were taken against him in the Court of King's Bench, there is no record of a conviction, and little serious effort was made to enforce the Act.Ross p. 412 He was soon restored to favour and received substantial grants of land in Ireland, and the office of Steward of the royal castles of Ulster. Lord Deputy of Ireland  Like most medieval English kings, Edward IV was normally prepared to leave Ireland to be governed by the Anglo-Irish nobility, but he made intermittent efforts to assert his authority over that Kingdom. In 1478, concerned at the increasing power of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, he dismissed him as Lord Deputy and appointed Grey in his place.Otway-Ruthven, A. J. History of Medieval Ireland Reissued Barnes and Noble 1993 p.397 Grey however faced the united opposition of the Anglo-Irish ruling class. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Baron Portlester, who was Kildare's father-in-law, refused to allow him use of the Great Seal of Ireland (although Grey was able to have a rival seal minted). Sir James Keating, Prior of the Order of Hospitallers, acting Constable of Dublin Castle, refused him entry to the castle, and his efforts to hold a Parliament at Trim collapsed when the sheriffs of Dublin and Louth simply ignored the writs of summons. Unable to impose his authority, Grey left Ireland the following year, thus leaving the way open for Kildare to become all-powerful in his generation: he was later called \\"the uncrowned King of Ireland\\".Otway-Ruthven p.398 Personal life Grey died in April 1496. His first marriage on 29 August 1454 was to Katherine Strangeways, daughter of Sir Thomas Strangeways by Katherine Neville, Duchess of Norfolk, daughter of Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and his wife Joan Beaufort; the marriage was childless. He had two natural sons, Richard and Henry, for whom he made generous provision in his will. After Katherine's death he remarried Margaret Stanley, daughter of Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley and his wife Joan Goushill, and widow of Sir John Boteler. She died in 1481. He married thirdly Katherine Stourton, daughter of William Stourton, 2nd Baron Stourton and Margaret Chideock;.Burke's Peerage p.1666 Both his second and third marriages were childless. After Grey's death, Katherine, who received substantial lands under his will, quickly remarried Edward IV's nephew William de la Pole. As a potential Yorkist pretender to the Crown, William was soon imprisoned in the Tower of London and remained there till his death. Katherine died in 1521. As Grey had no legitimate heir, the barony fell into abeyance between his father's three sisters.Burke's Peerage p.1666 It was finally called out of abeyance in 1989. He is said to have been keenly interested in alchemy, and obtained a licence from the King for the transmutation of metals, on condition that he must inform the Crown if he succeeded in producing gold.Burke's Peerage p.1666  References  Category:Barons in the Peerage of England Category:English politicians Category:1435 births Category:1496 deaths ","title":"Henry Grey, 4th (7th) Baron Grey of Codnor"},{"id":"35521405","text":"Alain Lefebvre (born 1960) is a French entrepreneur,Biographie Alain Lefebvre now Author of several books.Amazon.fr: Alain Lefebvre: Boutique Kindle He is recognized as a French pioneer in the client server computing and Internet era.

It is in the collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Description Fine Weather, Georgian Bay is an oil painting by the Canadian painter J.E.H. MacDonald, a member of one of the most well known Canadian group of painters, the Group of Seven. The painting was first exhibited at the Ontario Society of Artists in 1913. The peaceful, Sunday afternoon excursion painting, was quite different from MacDonald's previous works of industry and machinery. The work is vast and full of light, an uninhabited, untouched landscape, the only intrusion being the two small figures‚ÄîA. Y. Jackson on the left and Tom Thomson on the right‚Äîtying up their canoe, silhouetted against the clear, still waters. The painting exudes an air of the easy life. It is clear the emphasis of the composition is the sky, which covers more than three-quarters of the canvas. The low-lying cloud cover reflects the tree line below and the cumulus masses gently floating upwards draw the viewers eye from the lower left to the upper right corner of the painting. The sky is reflected in the light, dancing across the calm waters. MacDonald has achieved this effect through strong strokes parallel to the distant shoreline. Even in this piece, with its muted colours and pastel tones, MacDonald shows his skilled command over colour. The water is composed of dark and light blues and greens, showing its various depth and hinting at its crystal clarity, but MacDonald has also painted creamy pinks and soft purples reflecting the multi-coloured sky above. The small strip of beach in the foreground is also rich in colour, giving it life and movement. =Acquisition= This piece is part of the 2002 Ken Thomson gift to the Art Gallery of Ontario.

There are many different varieties of sphatikam. High quality quartz crystals are single- crystal silica with optical or electronic properties that make them suitable for hardstone carvings. The Hindu temples in South India use this semi- precious mineral for making Shiva Lingams. Sphatikam beads are made from translucent rose quartz are cut and polished as beads. Each bead is about ten millimeters in diameter. It is good conductor of heat. Hence people wear sphatikam jewelry (mala) to keep their body cool. Some other people claim that these beads have healing properties. Sphatika Lingam in scriptures In Hindu Shiva temples, Saiva Agamas(Shaivism's Agamas) allows worshiping Lord Shiva in the form of Sphatika Lingam or Crystal Lingam. The Saiva Agamas says \\"one can worship this Great God Shiva in the form of a Lingam made of mud or sand, of cow dung or wood, of bronze or black granite stone. But the purest and most sought-after form is the quartz crystal (Sphatika), a natural stone not carved by man but made by nature, gathered molecule by molecule over hundreds, thousands or millions of years, grown as a living body grows, but infinitely more slowly. Such a creation of nature is itself a miracle worthy of worship.\\" Sphatika Lingam in Temples Sphatika Lingam is representing the icon of Lord Nataraja. The Sphatika Lingams are protected in the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Shiva. Hindu priests offer milk, water, or vibhuti abhisheka to the Sphatika Lingam. They also chant 108 times Shiva Panchakshari Mantra . It is believed that Sphatika Lingam removes all curses and negative karma and will enhance ones confidence and power. =Thillai Natarajah Temple, Chidambaram= Thillai Natarajah Temple, Chidambaram is considered as one of the most ancient and most celebrated of Shiva temples in India.

Chidambaram temple is associated with Lord Nataraja, or Shiva in his Ananda Tandava pose (the Cosmic Dance of bliss) in the cosmic golden hall (Ponnambalam) and the hall of consciousness (Chit Sabha). Lord Shiva is also worshipped in this temple as \\"formless form\\" and this fact is being understood as Chidambara Rahasyam.

He is currently one of two guitarists in the experimental rock outfit Circa Survive, sole musician in Psychic Babble and previously in the band This Day Forward. Career = This Day Forward (1996-2003) = Frangicetto's musical career began in 1997 as the drummer of This Day Forward, consisting of brothers Mike and Gary Shaw on vocals and bass, respectively, Randy Wehrs and Mike Golen on guitars and Colin Frangicetto on drums. Their first full-length album, Fragments Of An Untold Story Born By Shunning The Opportunity (1999), released on Break Even Records, gained them significant credit in the local Philadelphia Suburbs. Soon after they signed to Eulogy Recordings and released The Transient Effects of Light on Water (2000) elevating them beyond the local scene. In late 2002, This Day Forward signed with Equal Vision Records and added guitarist Brendan Ekstrom who would go on to join Colin in Circa Survive. After releasing In Response in 2002 and touring with bands such as Thursday and Murder by Death, the band announced their break up in November for reasons unknown to the public. The band played their last show in December while on tour with Alexisonfire at the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, a venue they played earlier in their career. = Circa Survive (2004-present) = After the disbanding of This Day Forward, Frangicetto met up with friend and vocalist Anthony Green, then lead singer of the California rock band Saosin who, on the surface seemed on track to success. Green had decided to take a short amount of time off to return to Philadelphia and \\"hang out for a little bit\\" when he met with Colin and they began \\"jamming and writing every day\\". With the support of Equal Vision Records, who backed them with enough to get things moving after hearing the rough demos, things began to fall into place. Guitarist Brendan Ekstrom, who had previously worked with Colin in This Day Forward, was the first addition to the band. Colin has expressed a sincere admiration for Ekstrom's work in This Day Forward stating \\"I had always known that if I were to ever start another band I would need and want him with me.\\" Colin, Anthony and Brendan then found drummer Steve Clifford and bassist Nick Beard of Taken to complete the lineup. The group then went on to rent a house near Philadelphia where they found the inspiration for their first EP The Inuit Sessions and eventually their first full-length album Juturna(2005), released April 29, 2005. Juturna was produced by Brian McTernan and went on to peak at #183 on Billboard 200. After the initial success of Juturna, Circa stayed on with Equal Vision Records to release their second full-length album On Letting Go in 2007. The album entered the US billboard at #24 on Billboard 200 selling 24,000 copies in the first week. In 2008, Circa Survive returned from their tour with Thrice and Pelican began working on their third full-length album. On April 20, 2010 they released Blue Sky Noise on Atlantic Records and entered the Us Billboard at #11. = Psychic Babble (solo work) = While touring and recording as lead guitarist of Circa Survive, Frangicetto began writing songs that \\"were initially brought into consideration for inclusion on Circa Survive albums\\". Colin soon discovered that the material he was creating on his own \\"needed a different outlet.\\" After five years of writing and recording in \\"hotel rooms, tour buses, and apartments\\" Colin found himself with enough material to release a full-length studio album under the name Psychic Babble. The album, titled My Brother‚Äôs Ears/My Sister's Eyes, was released on August 18 under Yenta Records and features Colin on every instrument including vocals, guitar, drums, and bass. Colin's band mates from Circa Survive have expressed their full support for his solo work in particular front man Anthony Green who has also taken short breaks from Circa to work on solo acts. Although Colin did not tour with material from the album, he has made it clear that hopes to continue to work on Psychic Babble in the future and possibly record a second solo album. On November 5, 2013, Psychic Babble completed a successful Indiegogo Campaign which raised funds to hire a backing band. In 2013, Psychic Babble embarked on the \\"Young Legs Tour\\" with Anthony Green, Dave Davison (Maps & Atlases), and Brick + Mortar. = Film scoring = After the release of My Brother's Ears/My Sister's Eyes, Frangicetto began talking to directors most of which were friends of his about scoring a film. Not long after, he was asked to score a short horror-comedy film titled Play Dead. With only a four-week deadline, Colin was able to score the film using \\"a laptop, keyboard and guitar.‚Äù The film went on to premiere in minor indie film festivals. = Painting = Colin began painting on his downtime while touring with Circa Survive as \\"a great way to stay focused and mellow\\". This hobby quickly grew into a serious passion and Colin began selling his work in local exhibits and online. His influences range from Esao Andrews, who has created most of the work used for Circa's album covers, to Christopher Davison, Natalia Fabia, Jeremy Geddes and Picasso.

The Soviet Union maintained an embassy in Oslo and a consulate in Barentsburg, while Norway maintained an embassy in Moscow. Timeline A 2013 article in the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet said that the autumn of 1951 removal of more than 8,000 Soviet corpses from graves in North Norway, Operation Asphalt, led to \\"the toughest diplomatic conflict ever between Norway and Soviet\\".60 √•rs taushet og tristesse Strains in bilateral relations Thanks to the Svalbard Treaty, a state-owned statue of Vladimir Lenin could look over the Russian settlement in Barentsburg in Norway Both the environmentally devastating emissions from the Norilsk Nickel plant outside Nikel in the Murmansk Oblast and the territorial dispute over the Barents Sea have for decades been unresolved issues in Norway‚ÄìSoviet, then Norway‚ÄìRussia relations. On 27 April 2010 Norway and Russia officially resolved the territorial dispute in the Barents Sea.Norway, Russia agree on Barents Sea border A Soviet border provocation on 7 June 1968, which has been regarded as serious by historians, together with the invasion of Czechoslovakia that year and a general increase in Soviet military activity on the Norwegian border, contributed to a large increase in the funding for the Norwegian military presence on the Norwegian-Soviet border in Finnmark.Kunne besette Finnmark p√• tolv timer, Jakob Arvola Disagreements concerning the interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty, in conjunction with both countries' presence on Svalbard, was a heated political debate during the Cold War. From 1931, the Soviet Union maintained a presence on the archipelago in Barentsburg, Grumant and Pyramiden through the coal-mining company Arktikugol. In 1958, Norsk Polar Navigasjon proposed to build a civilian airport on Svalbard, but this was protested by the Soviet Union. Thus the establishment was stopped by Norwegian authorities. When a government-owned airport was proposed, continued Soviet protests were made, until a bilateral agreement was made permitting Svalbard Airport, Longyear. The Soviet Union also protested Kongsfjord Telemetry Station and the production of the 1985 action film Orion's Belt. Border The two countries retained a land border between S√∏r- Varanger and Murmansk Oblast. There was only one legal crossing point, at Storskog (Norway) and Boris Gleb (Russia), on the E105 road some 15 km east of Kirkenes. The border between Norway and the Soviet Union in the Varangerfjord was agreed upon in a treaty from 1957. Negotiations on the outside marine border were initiated in 1970. Norway claimed, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Article 15 and the Convention on the High Seas, that the border should follow the midline principle, the border being defined by midpoints between the nearest land area or islands, as is normal practice internationally. The Soviet Union claimed, based on a decision by Joseph Stalin from 1926, which was not recognized by any other country than the Soviet Union,http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.7064395 that a \\"sector principle\\" should apply, such that the border should follow meridian lines. Most of the disputed area was within what would normally be considered Norwegian according to the relevant international treaties. In 1975 the two countries agreed upon a moratorium prohibiting exploration for oil and gas in the disputed area. In 1978 a temporary agreement regulating fishery in a zone, named the ' () in some documents from the same time, was signed, which has since been renewed annually. From the Norwegian side, the agreement was negotiated by Labour politician Jens Evensen and his prot√©g√© Arne Treholt, who was later exposed as a Soviet spy and convicted of treason. The agreement was highly controversial in Norway. Many Norwegians believed that Evensen and Treholt gave too many concessions to the Soviet Union, and that they were motivated by Soviet sympathies. The agreement caused consternation in parliament and government, and Evensen had difficulty getting it accepted by his own government, where many held the opinion that he had exceeded his authority.http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/04/27/nyheter/innenriks/utenriks/russland/norge/11471787/ The opposition parties criticized Evensen for using the term Grey Zone, because it implied that Norway did not maintain its claim on rightful Norwegian territory in their opinion.K√•re Willoch, Myter og virkelighet, Cappelen Damm, 2002, In an interview with Danmarks Radio in 1990, Treholt, who was then serving a 20-year sentence, admitted that he had acted as an informer for the Soviet negotiators.Stein Vale, Teppefall i Treholtsaken, Cappelen Damm, 2009, , pp. 35‚Äì36 and p. 135 The arrest and conviction of Treholt in 1984‚Äì1985 had a devastating effect on Evensen, who withdrew completely from public life in Norway.Berit Ruud Retzer, Jens Evensen: Makten, myten og mennesket, 1999, File:Russian embassy Oslo front building.jpgThe Russian embassy in Oslo, Norway File:Consulate of Russia in Barentsburg.jpgThe Russian consulate in Barentsburg, Norway =Notes= Soviet Union Category:Bilateral relations of the Soviet Union ","title":"Norway‚ÄìSoviet Union relations"},{"id":"35521730","text":"Helmuth Schmalzl (born 8 October 1948, in Urtij√´i) is an Italian former alpine skier who competed in the 1972 Winter Olympics.

The film stars Ritter, Kate Bosworth, Kristen Johnston, Geoff Stults, Jason Biggs, and Rachel Bilson. Ritter plays the main character, Kim, who lives with her two roommates, Deena (Bosworth) and Laura (Bilson), in Los Angeles. Kim becomes pregnant after a one-night stand so she turns to her friends for help. Life Happens was released theatrically on April 13, 2012. Plot Deena (Kate Bosworth) and Kim (Krysten Ritter) each bring home a guy one night. Realizing they have no condoms, they go looking around in their house where Kim ultimately finds the last one, but Deena takes it and Kim has unprotected sex. One year later, Kim is a single mother. She still lives with her two girlfriends, Deena and Laura (Rachel Bilson), while trying to juggle her son named Max. She takes Max to his father Mark (Coiro), but he announces that he is not interested in being a father. Kim brings Max along to work with her one day, as a dog service company assistant to her youth-obsessed boss Francesca (Kristen Johnston). Francesca reprimands Kim for bringing Max with her and says that she would be fired if she does it again. Kim then takes Max to her grandfather (Seymour Cassel) who is currently living in a retirement home. Meanwhile, Deena tries to finish writing her book in a library and ends up hooking up with a guy. One night, as Kim works as a bouncer in one of Francesca's parties, she falls for a guy named Nicolas (Geoff Stults) who was with two of his friends, Henri (Justin Kirk) and Sergei (Jason Biggs), attending the party. That night, Francesca finally allows Kim to have a break and meet up with Nicolas who promised to buy her a drink earlier and they spend the night getting to know each other. They quickly form a relationship after Nicolas intently asks Francesca to have Kim take his dog in his house. Kim brings along Max with her yet again where she lies to Nicolas that Max is a child of one of her roommates and that she was just relied on to look after Max. Kim asks Deena to come with her on her date with Nicolas that evening where Deena agrees. Nicholas arrives along with his friend Henri, where they look to Deena as her roommate with the baby. Kim begs Deena to just go with the lie they have come up with where Deena responds that it wouldn't take long enough for them to know that Kim is the one with a baby. They have a double date where it seems that Deena and Henri are attracted to each other, although Henri dresses up in hippie clothing. The next day, Deena seems promoted from her career as a writer when someone could recognize her from an article she wrote. Kim on the other hand, seems to be an underdog as Francesca wouldn't allow to invest in her own dog service business. Laura, the other roommate seems to be unstable as she has been shifting jobs every week. Kim asks her to take care of Max since she has a date with Nicholas that night, but tells her she can't. She then freaks out and calls Deena who isn't answering her calls. Finally, she asks a young boy to babysit Max for her. Nicolas and Kim have sex after their romantic date, but it is not long before Nicolas discovers Kim's secret when milk leaks out of her breasts. This leaves Nicholas upset and Kim leaves. On her way home, she sees a paramedic leave and asks Deena what happened. Kim yells at Deena for not returning home early where Deena strikes back at her saying that Max is her responsibility and there is nothing that could excuse her behavior. Deena and Kim's friendship is compromised. Kim spends all day around the house and finally quits her job telling Francesca she never looked 21. The next day, Kim informs Deena that she has to move out of the house and focus her life on being a mother and as for Deena, her successful career. Kim buys a house and visits Mark who regrets everything he said about not being ready and he wants a shot of being a dad for once. Laura then enters a show competition and seems to be successful. Kim finally reconciles with Deena and Nicolas where they all play pool together. Cast Development In an interview, Ritter described how she and Coiro came up with the movie's plot. \\"Kat and I have been longtime friends. We‚Äôre both very psychotically driven, hard-working young women, and we always had this plan to dominate the world, like the two characters in the movie. We started writing and she had a baby, and we had this eureka moment where we just realized that‚Äôs the story we wanted to tell, about young girls, figuring out who they are and trying to have it all, but also when you throw a baby in the mix, it creates a whole other set of challenges.\\"Radish, Christina.

Overview Cover for The Immortals: An Art Collection of Baseball's Best by Dick Perez, published in 2010 He is a native of San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico. He moved to New York City at age six and to Philadelphia at age sixteen where he studied at the Philadelphia College of Art and the University of Pennsylvania.Kashatus, William C. (2010) \\"Introduction\\". In Perez, Dick (2010). The Immortals: An Art Collection of Baseball's Best. Dick Perez (self-published). . Perez's art was on exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia in 2004. It was the only one-man show dedicated to sports art at that institution. There is now a permanent exhibit of the 33 paintings (the original 32 plus an additional one of Pat Gillick, who was admitted to the Hall of Fame in 2011) in the Hall of Fame section at Citizens Bank Park. He has been the official artist for the Philadelphia Phillies since 1982 and was the official artist for the Major League Hall of Fame for twenty-five years. Starting in 1982, Perez painted a yearly set of cards for the \\"Diamond Kings\\" series for the Donruss Trading Card Co. The paintings were of baseball's premier players. The paintings were in partnership with Frank and Peggy Steele. (The Perez-Steele Galleries). Perez currently paints for Topps baseball cards. Perez's most notable work with Topps are the \\"Turkey Red\\" series cards, which featured both active and retired notable players. His paintings use acrylics, oils, gouache and watercolors. His artistic influences include such greats as John Singer Sargent, Anders Zorn, Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, and Diego Vel√°zquez. His works include other sports and non-sports paintings. Perez painted a portrait of Grover Cleveland Alexander for President Ronald Reagan and a Japanese stickball scene for Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. He also painted Arky Vaughan for President Bill Clinton. He was commissioned to paint Robert N. C. Nix, Jr., a former Pennsylvania Supreme Court Chief Justice, for the Pennsylvania Bar Association. He won a national contest in 1976 for the National League official centennial logo and designed the cover for the 1982 World Series. For Perez, baseball has a rich history with multiple facets (offense, defense, running, catching and pitching) and multiple focal points (the stadiums, the uniforms, the equipment and the fans in the stands). He tries to incorporate all of these elements into his paintings.

Life and career Born in Glasgow, his first club was the Scottish junior club Kirkintilloch Rob Roy. Hume signed for Rangers in 1959 and was to make 23 first-team appearances (including 17 League appearances) with them, scoring 3 goals. He made his Rangers d√©but in December 1959 in a home match against Kilmarnock. He was in the Rangers side that faced Fiorentina of Italy in the first leg of the first European Cup-Winners' Cup final in 1961, a final Rangers lost. His Rangers first-team appearances were probably limited by the form of left-winger Davie Wilson. He was one of the first British footballers to wear contact lenses on the field of play. In 1962 he signed for Middlesbrough where he would make 19 first-team appearances (scoring 5 goals) before returning to Scotland where he signed for Aberdeen (33 appearances and 4 goals in two seasons). He also played 3 times for Alloa Athletic, scoring a single goal. In 1965 he emigrated to South Africa where he signed for Johannesburg club Highlands Park; his brother Ronnie was a teammate. He helped Highlands Park win their fifth South African league title in seven years in 1966. After retirement he continued to live in Johannesburg with his wife and four children. Hume was shot dead in March 1997 at the wheel of his car near his home, the victim of a carjacking.

Maged's popularity and renown have dramatically increased due to her critical coverage of political events since the 2011 Egyptian revolution, as well as her hosting of individuals on her show that are critical of the military Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, that has ruled Egypt since the resignation of Hosni Mubarak. She has been described as \\"Egypt‚Äôs best and arguably most vocal [female voice] in delivering the true happenings to the country on a nightly basis.\\" Maged stopped presenting the show in 2013 and in 2014 joined a hunger strike campaign in solidarity with political prisoners.  Education and early career  Maged studied media at Cairo University and graduated in 1995. After graduating, Maged began working at Nile TV where she was employed for 12 years. Maged also produced films for the Al Jazeera Children's Channel. She later traveled extensively while working for Dubai-based Hot Spot productions, producing a series of documentaries. She currently works for ONTV.  Egyptian Revolution and Post-Revolution Political Coverage  Maged gained renown during the initial days of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, in which she would spend her days at protest locations and then report the stories she had been told by protesters during the nightly newscasts. After the revolution, her talk show emerged as a crucial space for the airing of critical opinions regarding pressing political and social issues in Egypt. Maged's hosting of individuals critical of the Egyptian military and its handling of the post- revolution period led her to be summoned for questioning by military authorities, and at one point pro-SCAF demonstrators displayed banners at a protest that called for her execution, along with fellow Egyptian television hosts Mona el-Shazly, Lamis Elhadidy and Amr Adib. = Baladna bel Masry = Maged hosted the talk show Baladna bel Masry on Egyptian satellite channel ONTV on which she and her guests frequently tackled controversial political issues. Egyptian media have largely struggled to adapt to the post-revolution atmosphere, in which red lines for coverage initially appeared to have been erased. It quickly became clear, however, that SCAF was re-organizing state media and moving to quash criticism of the military in private media. It is within this atmosphere of uncertainty regarding the acceptable limits of political coverage that Baladna bel Masry emerged as one of \\"the most respected and nuanced programs in Egypt in the post-revolution atmosphere\\". Maged's critical coverage of Egyptian politics and the SCAF led to the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, as well as her summoning for questioning by military authorities following comments made by journalist and blogger Hossam el-Hamalawy on her program. =Role in resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik= On 2 March 2011, Maged hosted then-Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, who had been appointed by ousted president Hosni Mubarak, and Egyptian novelist Alaa Al Aswany, author of The Yacoubian Building, as well as veteran journalist Hamdy Kandeel. Al Aswany was highly critical of Shafik during the broadcast. Shafik attempted to defend his previously publicized plan to turn Tahrir Square into an Egyptian version of London's Hyde Park, where protesters could gather to make speeches. Al Aswany responded, accusing him of \\"ignoring the more than 300 people who died in the protests and wanting to give out 'sweets and chocolate'\\". The Wall Street Journal wrote that Shafik retorted, \\"'wanting the people to stay in a clean place is wrong?' ... 'We should find out who killed them first,' answered Aswany\\". Al Aswany furthermore accused Shafik of being a holdover of the regime that Egyptians had struggled to topple, and that he was unfit to represent Egyptians in the post-revolution era. The episode led to Shafik's announcement of his resignation as Egyptian Prime Minister the next day. His poor performance and the vocal reaction to his responses, as well as the response to Al Aswany's fierce questioning of him, allegedly \\"helped push Egypt's military rulers into acceding to protester demands and pushing out Mr. Shafik\\". Importantly, the episode of Maged's program was argued to be \\"the first real political debate between a prime minister and opposition figures in Egypt\\", as interviews of government figures under the Mubarak regime generally involved sets of prepared questions and would never be so contentious. The interview has been called \\"the episode that toppled an Egyptian cabinet\\". The Los Angeles Times dubbed the interview \\"the TV talk show that played the biggest part in speeding up his imminent resignation\\". Maged said that she does not attribute Shafik's resignation solely to her show, stating that \\"I don‚Äôt think the show inspired his decision to resign, it simply sped it up. I believe there was already an idea to do just that. The show was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back.\\" =Summoning for Questioning by Military Authorities= Maged and Egyptian journalist and activist Hossam el-Hamalawy were interrogated by military authorities in May 2011, following Maged's hosting of el-Hamalawy on Baladna bel Masry. El-Hamalawy alleged in the broadcast that military police had tortured activists and that the head of the military police should be held responsible. El-Hamalawy wrote on his blog that he initially met with a military prosecutor as an \\"accused\\" and that Maged was a \\"witness\\", but that shortly after the questioning began the military claimed that they were only present for a \\"coffee and chat,\\" and that el-Hamalawy had been invited to hand over any information he had regarding abuses in military prisons. El-Hamalawy maintained that his accusations were based on evidence documented by international human rights organizations and local Egyptian activists, and that the same evidence remains publicly available. =Interview with Hazem Salah Abu Ismail= In November 2011, Maged conducted an interview with salafi Egyptian presidential candidate Hazem Salah Abu Ismail in which he urged her to wear the veil, telling her, \\"I like for you what I like for my sister, and I admire your courage during the January revolution and I wish the next time we meet, things will be different.\\" A salafi news outlet later re-aired the interview, covering Maged's hair and face with a dark filter during the broadcast. Cessation of broadcasting in 2013 Maged stopped presenting her talk show in 2013. In an interview with Al-Shorouk, she said that ONTV's priorities were national security and unity while her priority was freedom. In September 2014, she went on a 48-hour hunger strike as part of a campaign of solidarity with political prisoners who were also on hunger-strikes.

After originally beginning his career at the rather advanced age of 36, he was promoted through the ranks to eventually become Governor of the Dutch Gold Coast in 1858. He retired to the Netherlands in 1862, but returned to the Gold Coast as governor in 1869, to restore order in the embattled colony. In 1871, he left the Gold Coast again, one year before the transfer of the colony to the United Kingdom. Biography Cornelis Nagtglas was born in Utrecht on 16 May 1814 to Cornelis Nagtglas, sr. and Maria Ruyghart. He attended the Latin school in Utrecht but did not graduate, and instead pursued a career in the military. As new rules forbade the promotion of non-commissioned officers to commissioned officers, Nagtglas saw his career plans fall apart. Nagtglas decided to leave the army and pursue a civil career. Adventurism and a desire to get ahead made him apply for a position in the colonial administration of the Gold Coast. Nagtglas started his career as colonial administrator on the Gold Coast in 1851. After having been installed as an assistant by royal decree on 9 January, he arrived in Elmina on 28 May, and started working as an assistant judge from 28 July onward. On 10 January 1852, he was appointed commander of Fort Cr√™vecoeur in Accra. Nagtglas returned to Elmina in 1853, where he was promoted to resident on 7 December. On 1 May 1857, after returning from a leave to the Netherlands, Nagtglas became accountant of the Gold Coast. On 9 September 1857, he took over the duties of governor Jules van den Bossche, who left for the Netherlands because of illness, in an acting capacity. By royal decree of 8 May 1858, Nagtglas was appointed full governor, and upon receiving this news, he was installed by the Colonial Council in Elmina on 21 June 1858. After eleven years of service on the Gold Coast, Nagtglas was, at his own instigation, relieved of his duties on 23 June 1862, retiring to the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, he wrote a small pamphlet named A word concerning the question: \\"What should the Netherlands do with its possessions on the coast of Guinea?\\" (1863), in which he first elaborated on the dilapidated state of affairs of the colony, before arguing for increased salary for the administrators, for better education of the local people, for an interchange of territory with the British, for equal tariffs, and for the installation of qualified people on the Gold Coast. If all this were to turn out impossible, Nagtglas posited it would be better to sell the forts to Britain, as Denmark did in 1850. Golden palmtree awarded to Nagtglas by the colonial administrators of the Gold Coast on 8 June 1871. The last stone of the Nagtglas Redoubt built in 1868 on the coast east of Elmina, laid by Cornelis Nagtglas on 28 September 1869 upon his return to the Gold Coast. The stone was later transferred to Elmina Castle, where it can still be seen today. The stone does not commemorate, as is sometimes believed, the departure of the Dutch from the Gold Coast. Nagtglas was then installed as an advisor to the Dutch government, and negotiated with fellow-advisors Henri Alexander Elias and Bentinck the Convention between Great Britain and the Netherlands for an Interchange of Territory on the Gold Coast of Africa with the United Kingdom. After this trade of forts proved a failure, and the Dutch Gold Coast came at the brink of being run-over by revolting local peoples, Nagtglas was again appointed governor of the Gold Coast on 20 March 1869, arrived in Elmina on 14 May, and installed the next day. Nagtglas commanded several Dutch military interventions in an effort to subject the revolting locals. Due to illness, he quit his job as Governor on 8 June 1871, left for the Netherlands two days later, and was discharged with honour on 20 October. Reputation Among both Dutch and British colonial administrators, Cornelis Nagtglas had a reputation of devotion to all matters concerning the Gold Coast. He initiated and maintained an extensive bureaucracy while governor, giving the impression that was the governor of a large colony rather than the governor of a small colony consisting of a few forts. Cornelis Nagtglas is often portrayed in literature as an enlightened colonial ruler, with a good feel towards local customs and politics, and with a sense of realism in terms of the limited Dutch influence on the Gold Coast in the 19th century. Michel Doortmont of the University of Groningen questions this reputation, however, in an investigation of Nagtglas' handling of a dispute between a local chief and the Dutch commander of Fort St Anthony at Axim concerning hammock-bearers. Not understanding the lack of power of the chief towards his subjects in this respect, Doortmont argues that \\"Nagtglas was perhaps not the big colonial thinker many have held him to be\\".  Scientific work  During his time on the Gold Coast, Nagtglas collected 236 bird specimens together with zoologist Hendrik Pel, which he donated in 1862 to the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, which is now Naturalis Biodiversity Center. The Nagtglas's African dormouse is named after Cornelis Nagtglas.  Personal life  During his first period on the Gold Coast, Nagtglas had a son named Karel Anne Nagtglas with the local Euro-African Anna Abraba Smith (about 1840‚Äì1920), whom he legally recognized as his when he returned to the Gold Coast in 1869. Anna Abraba Smith would later marry George Emil Eminsang. In the Netherlands, he married Wilhelmina Sophia Michell on 17 December 1862. They had two daughters that survived infancy.

The by-election was important for shaping the future Labour Party attitude to electoral relations with the Liberal Party.  Vacancy  In September 1919 the Conservative MP Robert Burdon Stoker died. He had previously represented Manchester South since March 1918. At the 1918 general election he had been in receipt of the Coalition Government coupon.  Electoral history  The seat was created for the 1918 general election partly out of the Unionist/Liberal marginal seat of Manchester South and partly out of the Liberal seat of Stretford. The result at the last general election was;  Candidates  *The Liberal party selected a new candidate in 45-year-old William Pringle, who had been Member of Parliament for North West Lanarkshire until the 1918 general election, when he had been defeated at Glasgow Springburn. *There was speculation that Labour would not contest the election, allowing the Liberals a clear run at the Unionists. Since the general election, Lib-Lab co-operation, otherwise known as the progressive alliance had seen the two parties gain two Unionist seats each. One of Labour's leading figures, Arthur Henderson was sympathetic to such an arrangement.The Downfall of the Liberal Party by Trevor Wilson Henderson had himself been the beneficiary of Lib-Lab co-operation when the Liberals allowed him a straight fight with the Unionists at the 1919 Widnes by-election a month earlier. The Widnes seat neighboured Rusholme and the Liberals had been active in support of Henderson.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies The local Labour party insisted on fighting the seat and on 9 September announced a new candidate Dr. Robert Dunstan from Fulham, who had been a Liberal politician up until 1917. He had contested Birmingham Moseley at the previous election.\\"Labour Candidate For Rusholme.\\" Times [London, England] 10 Sept. 1919: 7. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 5 Aug. 2014. *The Conservative party's new candidate was 32-year-old John Thorpe, who had not contested the 1918 general election. Thorpe was the eldest son of Ven. John Henry Thorpe, Archdeacon of Macclesfield. He had trained as a barrister. *The Conservative party also now faced a challenge from the right when the National Party intervened with first time candidate Capt. Roger Crewdson. Campaign The election campaign took place during the great railway strike of 1919.The Downfall of the Liberal Party by Trevor Wilson Dunstan, the Labour candidate, sought to appeal to the centre ground by calling for widespread abolition of economic war-time restrictions. Pringle, the Liberal candidate, came out in support of Labour's policy of a capital levy, something that was not Liberal policy. It has been suggested that this stance may have cost him votes, lost to the Unionist candidate.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies Pringle advocated economic retrenchment to appeal to Unionist voters and also the nationalization of the railways and mines to appeal to Labour voters.\\"Labour Candidate For Rusholme.\\" Times [London, England] 10 Sept. 1919: 7. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 5 Aug. 2014.  Result  The turnout for the by-election was up on the last general election. The Unionists managed to hold the seat. Their support had fallen, but not much because of the intervention of the National Party. The Labour candidate did particularly well and pushed the Liberal candidate into third place. The relative success of the Labour party in such a constituency encouraged them to field candidates in further Unionist/Liberal marginals rather than seek to reconstruct the Progressive Alliance.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies  Aftermath  Thorpe sat until his defeat to the Liberals in 1923. His son Jeremy Thorpe, became Leader of the Liberal party. Dunstan continued to be unsuccessful in his bid to enter parliament. Pringle made a successful return to the House in 1922, winning Penistone for the Liberals. Crewdson's political career ended here.

Ivan Kostov graduated in Economics from the Karl Marx Higher Institute of Economics (today's University of National and World Economy) in Sofia in 1974, and later earned a Ph.D. in Mathematical Modeling of Economic Processes from Sofia University. He then worked as an associate professor at Sofia Technical University and entered politics after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the Bulgarian communist leader, Todor Zhivkov. Kostov became an economic expert for the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF). His political career began as Member of Parliament in the 7th Grand National Assembly in 1990 (he was an MP from 1990 to 2013) and he went on to become Bulgaria's Finance Minister in the two consecutive governments of Dimitar Popov (December 1990 ‚Äì October 1991) and Filip Dimitrov (November 1991 ‚Äì December 1992).  Chairman of the UDF and Prime Minister  : For more information on the Kostov cabinet, see Kostov Government. Kostov was elected chairman of the UDF in 1994. During the winter of 1996 - 1997, mass protests took place against Bulgarian Socialist Party's government. The causes for the complete crisis were hyperinflation, unemployment and food shortages. The protests ultimately led to the fall of the socialist government. The UDF won the May 1997 elections, and Kostov became Bulgaria's Prime Minister, his cabinet eventually became the country's first post-communist government to serve its full 4-year term. Kostov is credited with turning around his country's fortunes, implementing the currency board in Bulgaria, removing price controls and creating a modern market economy, which put it on the path of sustainable economic growth. Under his government, long-delayed economic reforms were carried out, including privatization of state-owned enterprises was carried on a large scale and the country started long-sought accession talks with the European Union (which Bulgaria joined on January 1, 2007). In foreign affairs, Ivan Kostov followed a strongly pro-EU and pro-NATO course, putting the country on a firm path of integration with the EU and NATO. As a part of the pro-NATO stance of his government, during the war in Kosovo he showed leadership by allowing NATO but not Russia to use Bulgaria's airspace despite overwhelming opposition in Bulgaria to the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia and daily protest marches led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party. This single act prevented Russia from resupplying its forces occupying Pristina airport, thus denying the Russians a foothold in Kosovo. This decision ensured the success of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo War and ultimately led to a visit to Sofia by US President Bill Clinton in 1999. Against the insistence of the United States, Kostov didn't allow refugees from Kosovo to enter Bulgaria, but arranged for them to be temporarily settled in the Republic of Macedonia instead. Kostov's rule was characterized by media claims for massive mismanagement and corruption, none of which have been proven. A number of major Soviet era enterprises that were already bankrupt and in the process of liquidation were sold to the highest bidder below the price of their assets because of the tremendous debts these enterprises had. This was done to allow the new investor to save the jobs of the employees, who would otherwise have to immediately lose their job because these enterprises were in a procedure of liquidation to pay off their creditors. This sale under the book value of assets has been misused by critics of Kostov's government since in unfounded accusations of corruption. While successful in stabilizing the country, Bulgaria's current account balance started growing negative.. Some of Kostov's privatization policies were criticized by his opponents from the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Ultimately the UDF lost in the June 2001 election to the newly formed National Movement Simeon II. Kostov resigned as chair of the UDF and eventually left the party to establish, in 2004, a new political party, Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB). He chaired DSB until June 2013. Support for Fiscal Rules In 2010, the GERB government of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov proposed instituting a tight fiscal rule in the Bulgarian Constitution, namely that the budget deficit could not exceed 2% of GDP in any one year. The proposal was supported by Ivan Kostov and his party Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria and Parliament adopted it in November 2010. Kostov's DBS supported several other initiatives by GERB's government, including the ban on smoking in public places, and the pension reform proposed by Finance Minister Simeon Djankov. Personal He is married to Elena Kostova. Kostov's hobby is tennis and he is also an avid follower of chess.
