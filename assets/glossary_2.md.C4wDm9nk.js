ATOM concept arose from a need to clarify, the adoption and widespread recognition of the laws and regularity, based on strict criteria. The rationale for its creation are: :* huge accumulation of knowledge dispersed in the specialist literature of many fields and disciplines, :* excessive one-sidedness still emerging of partial approaches, :* lack of synthetic, coherent approach, which integrates various views on the organization and management, :* necessity to establish of the basic paradigms of the organization and management, including in relation to issues such as: subject of organization and management, dominant position of the work processes, classification of management functions, partition the system into subsystems, process-modelling of the system, the relationship between the concepts of 'organization' and 'management', impartial classification of schools and directions.  The subject of the organization and management  Table 1. Ergo-transformational systems location in the system classifications ; Ergo-transformational process: A sequence of mutually dependent states of material transitions, occurring under the influence of purposeful actions of a person who participates in this process (or have been designed and running by a person) and under the influence of the functioning equipment. As a result, the input material is transformed into the desired output product. ; Ergo- transformational system: The system of purposeful processing of material objects and/or information, which is regulated (or controlled) by human. The subject of the organization and management are only and exclusively ergo- transformational systems and ergo-transformational processes. Essential nature of the ergo-transformational systems and ergo-transformational processes are the products that have been purposeful created. These are material objects or information.This assertion replace widespread view that the purpose of organization and management is a 'work process' or any other views on this topic. Location of ergo-transformational systems in the classification of systems, shows Table 1. Classification criterion is the degree of human intervention (involvement) in the system.  Law and regularity  = Law of the ergo-transformational process structure: three related sequences of change = Table 2. Process classification of the ergo-transformational system depending on gradation of intentional goals and on relationships resulting from servicing Table 3. Process classification of the ergo-transformational system due to the nature of the material being processed Any ergo- transformational process is the synthesis, the integration of three components, running parallel and mutually coupled sequences ‚Äì sub-processes involved. They are: :* the sequence of the state transitions of material [M], :* the sequence of human activities directly involved in the process (or the people directly involved in the process) [H], :* the sequence of state transitions of equipment and tools (functioning of equipment and tools) [E]. This law deserves to be called the first basic law of organization and management. Consistently arise from it further logical regularity. Process classification of the ergo-transformational system depending on gradation of intentional goals and on relationships resulting from servicing, shows Table 2. Are distinguished the following types of processes: : A) the Primary Processes (Ppri), : B1) the Auxiliary Processes (Paux), : B2) the Information Processes (Pinf). Due to the nature of the processed objects can be distinguished processes for matter processing, and a processes for information data processing (see Table 3). = Law of the servicing by the Auxiliary Processes Paux = The functioning of any ergo-transformational process requires servicing the sequence of human activities 'H' and the sequence of functioning of equipment and tools 'E', by the Paux processes. One may to distinguish four categories of Paux processes: # The processes of repairs and maintenance of equipment (Prep) # The processes of servicing of tools (Pt) # The processes of energy service (Pen) # The processes of servicing of people (PH) As belonging to one of the categories of ergo-transformational processes, each Paux process also requires servicing by other auxiliary processes, unless did it himself. = Law of the servicing by the Information Processes Pinf = Figure 1. A logical model of the ergo-transformational process Functioning of any ergo-transformational process is dependent on the integration of its three sequences through servicing by the Pinf processes. Segmentation of ergo- transformational process for consecutive operations also requires servicing by the binding Pinf processes. Therefore, any ergo-transformational process requires servicing by three kinds of Pinf: # Pinf processes binding three sequences of ergo-transformational process within individual operations # Pinf processes binding subsequent operations within ergo-transformational process # Pinf processes binding processes of the ergo-transformational system Any Pinf process as a special category of ergo-transformational process, also requires servicing by other Pinf process (and of course, by other Paux processes), unless did it himself. Figure 1 presents a logical model of the ergo- transformational process. = Law of multi-dimensional decomposition and synthesis of ergo-transformational systems = Figure 2. Schema of the ergo- transformational system model Law of multi-dimensional decomposition and synthesis of ergo-transformational systems can be define as the second basic law of organization and management. The primary issue of identification or designing each ergo-transformational system (new or improved) is their accurate decomposition into subsystems. Arbitrary decomposition into subsystems is methodologically unacceptable, as not based on precise criteria. ATOM not treat the system as a 'flat' configuration, but as a 'spatial', taken from several points of view - as separate, although reciprocally incorporated 'sectional views' (reflections), depending on separable criteria of decomposition. It is assumed that these cuts may be many, but so far succeeded established only four criteria (sectional views and structures): # The first sectional view considers the system as the structure of all processes occurring in system: S1 = . # The second sectional view refers to the structure of all the resources participating in the system (materials and products [M], people [H], equipment and tools [E], information resources [D], capital and financial resources (free financial resources) [F] ): S2 = . # The third sectional view reflects the hierarchical structure of all organizational units (primary, auxiliary and informational) that make up the ergo- transformational system: S3 = . # The fourth sectional view presents the dynamics of subsequent stages of the development of the system - from the design of the facility and preparing the way through the stage of implementation and normal operation until the changes or possible liquidation of the system: S4 = . The individual sectional views belong to the relational configuration of the system: Sn = . Figure 2 cites the schema of system model. = Law of phasic structure of integral Information Process = Table 4. The next phases of any ergo-transformational process Figure 3. Relationships between the phases of the information process and parameters of other serviced processes Law of phasic structure of entire Information Process can be described as the third basic law of organization and management. It is a prelude to determine the further regularity of designing of the information subsystems. The essence of any Information Processes (Pinf) is servicing of other processes or objects. In any integral Pinf process there are four consecutive phases: # Phase of prospective preparation products parameters serviced processes, the methods of achieving and other factors (normative N1), # Phase of the planning serviced processes (Np), # Phase of current state records and results of running serviced processes, once operational (Rec), # Phase of the control and adjustment serviced processes. A more detailed interpretation of the successive phases of any Pinf process, presents Table 4. Figure 3 shows the relationships between the phases of the Information Process and parameters of serviced processes. = Regularity of the links between processes. Models of relationships. = Figure 4. An example model of linkages and couplings between the serviced and servicing processes of the ergo- transformational system These regularity and the models are a consequence resulting from the previously specified laws, i. e.: the law of the process structure (three related sequences of changes), the law of unavoidable servicing of two sequences by a specialized Auxiliary Processes (Paux) and the law of the sequence servicing by the relevant Information Processes (Pinf). There can be many variants of the possible combinations of servicing of processes and coupling of processes. In any case, always spaces the law of servicing of everyone without exception ergo-transformational processes. Figure 4 presents an example model of linkages and couplings between the serviced and servicing processes of the ergo-transformational system. = Regularity of combinatorics any kind of processes in any ergo-transformational system = Figure 5. Mutual relationships between Primary Processes (Ppri), Auxiliary Processes (Paux) and Information Processes (Pinf) in ergo- transformational system In any ergo-transformational system it is unavoidable occurrence of a set of Primary Processes (Ppri), Auxiliary Processes (Paux) and Information Processes (Pinf). Depending on the nature of the processed materials is grouped processes for matter processing, and a processes for information processing. Figure 5 refers to the mutual relationships between Primary Processes (Ppri), Auxiliary Processes (Paux) and Information Processes (Pinf) in ergo-transformational system.  Management as a special kind of Information Process  The regularity of the above shows that the management can only logically be interpreted as a Pinf process higher degree. This process coordinates several Pinf processes on lower degree. Particularly relevant to management processes is its integrity; they must take into account comprehensive the requirements for control of all Primary Processes (Ppri), Auxiliary Processes (Paux) and Information Processes (Pinf) and cover all four phases and components of Information Process. According to gradation of linkages and coupling of ergo-transformational processes, process of management is a Pinf process at least 3rd degree (Pinf ‚â• 3), co-ordinating Information Processes at least 2nd degree (Pinf ‚â• 2). Information Processes lower degree (Pinf ‚â§ 2) can be oriented to either phase or part of an integrated Information Process, or to control of one kind of the process in ergo-transformational system. It follows, that the term 'organization' in the sense of functional can be interpreted as each Information Processes of at all levels in ergo-transformational system. For example, a worker at the workplace, master, technologist, engineer, clerk, planner, controller, etc., certainly are involved in the organization, but do not always have to be a 'management', which is the domain of information processes of higher degrees, usually associated with higher levels of management.

Matayos is a small township of about two thousand inhabitants along the B1 road (Kisumu-Busia Highway), sixteen kilometres from the Busia border point, and about two kilometres east of the Sio River bridge. Matayos Division, whose seat is at Matayos centre is a very small borough covering the stretch of about twenty-two kilometres from Korinda junction near Busia town at its extreme west-point to the Rakite stream depression near Bumala junction to the east. The division is home to about eighty-thousand people. Location Matayos is a cross-roads trading centre, formed from the confluence of dirt-roads that serve the hinter-regions of Funyula, Mulwanda, Namboboto to the south, and eLugulu, Nasewa sugar-belt and Nambale district headquarters to the North. Matayos township at Lwanya area, is the administrative seat of Matayos Division in Busia County which have three location namely Nasewa, lwanya and Nangoma, and has been administered by a divisional officer continuously since the year 1990, when it was carved by presidential decree out of the larger Nambale Division of the former Busia District. Matayos is well served by streams and bisected by the River Sio as it flows form Mount Elgon toward Lake Victoria. Matayos is hilly to the south- east, with the land generally slanting to its lowest points in the Sio swamp, and rising again as it sprawls towards the international border with Uganda. Name The name Matayos is an offshoot of colonial Christian influences. Elderly residents recount that the man whose land was transformed into the public forum (baraza) seat of the colonial Chief's, was named Matayo, baptized as such by Italian missionaries of the early 20th century. Religion A contested base for both the Church Missionary Society and the Roman Catholic Church, Matayos area retains schools and other symbols of the two Christian sects. The Catholics run their affairs from the eastern end at Lwanya, while the Anglicans have made Busende to the west their local fiefdom. The township is therefore known by its English rendition, as Matayo's market, later turned into Matayos, much in the same sense as Mumias town was derived from Nabongo Mumia's base at Elureko. Constituency A new Matayos Constituency was represented in Kenya's 11th Parliament under the new constitutional dispensation represented by Honorable Godfrey Odanga and has four ward represented area i.e. Matayos, Bukhayo west, Burumba, Mayenje wards. Previously combined with Nambale to the North and Busia Township to the West, to form the carved-up Nambale Constituency represented in the 8th through the 10th Parliaments by Kenya's former Energy, Trade and later Finance Minister Chrysanthus Okemo. Economy With the establishment of farmers co-operatives in the 1950s and sixties, Matayos was one of the early townships to host a cotton seed distribution store and a milk-collection centre. The inhabitants of Matayos are subsistence farmers who mainly grow cassava, white and yellow (Nyayo) maize, sweet potatoes,{ground nuts},{ soya beans}sorghum, finger millet, yams {bananas} and beans on small pieces of land, usually an acre or less. They raise livestock on a similarly small scale, mainly cattle which acts as draught animals for ploughing purposes, some goats,{pig farming}{ fishpond farming }sheep and usually some free-range chickens the area also grow cash crop such as sugarcane farming in Busibwabo and Nasewa area . Matayos area has been rapidly influenced by national economic and development policy, with efforts aimed at literacy, basic healthcare and water provision. There has been sustained effort by the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) of the national government to develop and equip schools, provide piped water and supply drugs at country referral hospital and local health centre i.e. Matayos health centre and Nasewa health centre and five working dispensaries, matayos health centre one of the oldest in the country. Located some sixteen kilometers away from the international border, blessed with an abundance of construction materials (sand from the Sio and stones from the Nangoma, Ganjala, Odiado hills) and served by one of Kenya's main highways, Matayos was viewed as a favorite candidate to become the county of Busia, away from the insecurity and hustle-and-bustle of the Busia border town. Education The area has 13 public secondary schools and more than thirty primary schools three village polytechnics, all run by the government. Notable residents In national affairs, Matayos has produced several public figures, including the longest-serving former Attorney-General of Kenya, Amos Wako, and the current permanent secretary in the office of prime Minister Andrew Mondo and former chair of the Law Society of Kenya, Kenneth Akide.

This HBO film interpretation directed by Ed Bell and Thomas LennonInternet Movie Database website - Unchained Memories, accessed May 5, 2010. is a compilation of slave narratives, narrated by actors, emulating the original conversation with the interviewer. The slave narratives may be the most accurate in terms of the everyday activities of the enslaved, serving as personal memoirs of more than two thousand former slaves. The documentary depicts the emotions of the slaves and what they endured. The \\"Master\\" had the opportunity to sell, trade, or kill the enslaved, for retribution should one slave not obey. History The largest collection of slave narratives emerged from the Federal Writers' Project. Created by the Federal Government under the WPA to reduce unemployment during the 1930s, one component of the Federal Writers' Project involved interviews with thousands of former slaves in 17 states. The oral history interview project yielded an extraordinary set of 2,300 autobiographical documents known as the Slave Narrative Collection. What emerged from these documents were pictures of living standards, the daily chores, and long days, along with stories of the good and bad \\"Master.\\" The brutality, torture, and abuse under slavery are themes in the interviews. After the Civil War ended in 1865, more than four million slaves were set free. The main objectives were to inform the public and describe the history and life of the former slaves. More than 2,000 slave narratives along with 500 photos are available online at the Library of Congress as part of the \\"Born in Slavery\\" project.

Established in 1995, the orphanage serves girls ages 2 through 12 and is operated by the Reformed Church of Transcarpathia. History In the mid 1980s the Dutch relief organisation Stichting Hulp Oost-Europa delivered a large amount of humanitarian relief to many Ukrainian state orphanages. This, however, failed to reach the children. Having satisfied themselves that this was the case and in view of the dreadful state of affairs prevailing at that time in Ukrainian state orphanages; the lack of basic hygiene, indifference towards the children, the physically and mentally retarded condition of the children, the poor condition of the buildings and the impracticality of improvement, they decided to set up a Christian children's home which could serve as a model for the whole of Ukraine. At the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union, Stichting Hulp Oost-Europa together with the Weeshuis der Hervormden (Lindenhof) and the Partnerhilfe foundations started to organise this, and by March 1995 after two years of construction the brand new, two-cone basic building (more than 130x130 feet) in Nagydobrony, near Uzhhorod in Ukraine was ready for occupation. On December 1, 1995 the children's home was handed over with all due ceremony to the district of the Reformed Church of Transcarpathia to which it officially belongs. From its inception the establishment made every endeavour after self-sufficiency by setting up its own farm. Supporting funds were sufficient from the very beginning for a wide variety of things, so much so that whatever new building was needed it could be built from the surplus. In the course of time, however, due to continually rising prices and cost of wages coupled with stagnation of supporting funds, not only was the work unable to be finished but now the yearly support funds do not even cover the minimum annual wage of the children's carers alone. In reality, the majority of the workers are on a partly voluntary basis. Compensation for the below-average wages is by allowances in kind and other concessions e.g. holiday leave. Electricity and gas is purchased at industrial prices, and for that reason it has not been possible so far to implement gas heating - it is too expensive. The Ukrainian state has provided no material assistance, apart from an up-to-date computer in February 2007 from the district council. As one of the models for the country, the children's home is visited every year by government ministers, various regional medical officers and some church bishops too. Facilities The children's home itself is situated in an area of . Here is the main building and a large outbuilding which everybody simply refers to as the \\"new building\\". In this area, too, are the cowshed, stables, pig shed and various other farm buildings, garages, the workshop and stores. There are 7 polytunnels (i.e. polyethylene greenhouses) which alone cover an area of 23.000 SF. It can be seen from the foregoing how much dependence there is on the farm (set up through considerable effort) together with gifts from abroad. In the fields and polytunnels, among other things, carrots, parsley, kohlrabi, potatoes, radish, cauliflower, peas, beans, tomatoes, paprika, beetroot, cabbage etc. are grown. Out of this, other institutions are supported too. An apiary provides honey for the children. Cattle and pig stocks provide meat and dairy produce: milk, sour cream and cottage cheese. Altogether, approx. is under cereals: spelt, durum wheat and other milling wheat, providing all-year- round feeding for the animals. Unfortunately, more often than not, they are unsuitable for bread flour. The working bakery supplies the daily bread requirements, also rolls and approx. 15 types of bakery produce. The bakery was set up with the help of donations from the Netherlands and the U.S.A. and has been in production since December 2004. The agricultural work required implements so, the staff (partly from donations) set up a machine pool consisting of several tractors. The upkeep and repair of the tractors and implements is done by the staff. Since 1999 there has been a combine harvester, and in 2006 the SARA foundation in the [United States - USA] donated a brand new [Belarus tractor]. The children take part in looking after the animals and in agricultural work so that they may experience what kind of work provides the food that reaches the table. The aim for the children is that they should become useful members of the community. For those children, who, on account of handicap, will not be able to leave the children's home, an appropriate field of activity is ensured so that they will not feel themselves superfluous. So those girls wishing to proceed to further studies get whole- hearted support to help them reach the goals they have set themselves. There are a great many foreign visitors, so from 2005 a guest house has provided suitable accommodation for supporters. The guest house provides a conference hall with a seating capacity of 60, giving opportunity to different organisations and groups to organise conferences e.g. medical, mental health care, agriculture etc. The children's home keeps up a very good relationship with state orphanages, schools, children's hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and institutions for the blind and deaf. From the crops and the humanitarian aid received, distribution is made (according to ability) to the above- mentioned and other institutions. Services Children from 2 years old to 12 years old are taken in - but only girls. Admission does not consider creed or ethnic background; only their need of help (i.e. difficult social environment) or those who are seriously handicapped physically or psychologically, orphans, one-parent children or those in situations where they are endangered. 32 of the children are such as have been given up by their parents. 3‚Äì4 years old children with various medical conditions have come from state orphanages, each one of them diagnosed there as mentally and physically handicapped and lacking the ability to speak. By the grace of God, love and care can work wonders, since nearly all of these children can now speak, and right now 33 children out of the 73 in the home attend the village school - and not with poor results either. Five are now 1st and 2nd year pupils in the Nagydobrony Reformed Lyceum. From among the primary school children 5 attend music school. In the children's home itself there is a special class. 17 children do not go to school, 16 go to this special class, and the other 2 have already finished school and now work, one as a kitchen assistant and the other as a secretary in the home. This is not a closed institution like the state orphanages. These children who are physically and mentally capable of attending school go by themselves to Nagydobrony High School more than 1000 yards away. The older children attend church and take part in other activities too. Here the children know the people in the village, they see the flowers, trees and animals belonging to the houses. They learn the rules of the road, they know their environment, they meet friends and so it wil be easier for them later on to make their way in life. Over and above this the children will stay as long as they need to, that is for their whole lives. Members of the local and neighbouring congregations can take their \\"own children\\" home from noon on Saturday till Sunday afternoon every second week. Only such persons can do this as are morally suitable. We seek by means of these family visits to form in the children a true picture of Christian family life which in a state institution they could never experience. The children are divided into 9 groups. In setting up each group, age, personality and physical and mental capabilities are taken into account. In each group there are 6-8 children. Each room has its own washroom and the disabled have their own specially fitted out washroom. Education is provided in the building for those who are either physically incapable of going to school or who are mentally retarded. In the grounds there is a flower bed (60 yards long by 30\\" wide) for the children where even those confined to wheel-chairs can enjoy the pleasure of gardening. In the building there is a computer room with permanent internet access, a therapy room, a library, a study room and a practice kitchen. The children have the possibility of using various open-air recreational facilities suited to each age group. There are three small play areas, a soccer field, a diameter swimming pool and the opportunity to go horse riding too. there is also a fish pond on which it is possible to go boating and each child who can ride a bicycle has one of her own. The children often go on trips to the nearby woods and regularly organise various outings during the holidays. Visits are made to the well known sights and towns of Carpathia. Sometimes neighbouring towns are visited so that they get to know town life as well.

He was the first president of the Constitutional Council (Arabic ) of Lebanon, from 1994 to 1997. He resigned from the Council over the handling of the parliamentary elections of 1996. Early years Born on November 22, 1919, Wajdi Mallat was the scion of a family of poets from the city of Baabda, the capital of Ottoman Mount Lebanon. His uncle Tamer (1856‚Äì1914), a judge during the Ottoman era, was a well-known poet who stood publicly against the arbitrariness and corruption of Wasa Basha (Arabic ), the plenipotentiary governor of Mount Lebanon.Tamer Mallat's verses on Wasa Basha (ruled 1883‚Äì1892) are celebrated to date in Lebanon as the expression of courage in the face of corruption: \\"They say: Wasa has passed away, I responded, for I knew/Let coins ring off the marble of his grave, and I guarantee you he will come back to life.\\" The verses, said upon Wasa's death in 1892, appear in the Diwan of the two brother poets, Diwan al-Mallat, Al- matba'a al-adabiyya, Beirut 1925, p.17. On 19 April 2010, the Lebanese daily al-Nahar's obituary of Wajdi Mallat concluded with the last verse, and the elegy of Amal Haddad, the president of the Beirut bar association started with reference to the verses. His mother, Marie Checrallah, hailed from a family of physicians educated in Constantinople. His father, Shibli (1875‚Äì1961), was celebrated as the \\"Poet of the Cedars\\" (Arabic ) in Cairo and Alexandria, Baghdad, Damascus, Aleppo and Haifa, and entertained close friendships across the region, from then Emir Abdallah of Transjordan (later King Abdullah I of Jordan) to the first president of independent Lebanon, Bechara El-Khoury.See the poems said on the various occasions in Shibli Mallat, Diwan (part 2), Beirut 1952, pp.55‚Äì140. Education and early career Wajdi Mallat was educated at the Jesuit college of Beirut, then studied for an advanced degree in Latin while earning a Masters in law from Saint Joseph University, where his classmates included many of the subsequent intellectual and political leaders of Lebanon. Among his professors was Choucri Cardahi. Wajdi Mallat was attached early on to the unique interwar experiment of liberalism in the Levant, especially Egypt, which he lived first hand from the close friendship between his father and the leader of the Egyptian national movement, Saad Zaghloul.Wajdi Mallat, \\"Chibli Mallat (Life and Works 1875‚Äì1961)\\", English introduction to Shibli al-Mallat, Sha'er al-arz, madrasat al-talaqi al-watani (Chibli Mallat, The Poet of the Cedars: A school for national identity), Raidi Press, Beirut 1999, p.90. As the young representative of the Lebanese delegation to UNESCO, which held an early Congress in Beirut in 1948, he made friends with such luminaries as Taha Hussein and Louis Massignon on his trip to Paris in preparation of the meeting.Wajdi Mallat, \\"Risalat al-unesco (Unesco's call)\\", Mawaqef-Positions, Dar al-Nahar, Beirut 2005, pp.152‚Äì54. Lawyer and minister Following a legal apprenticeship with prominent Lebanese lawyers Edmond Gaspard and Yusuf al-Sawda, he established Mallat law offices in 1949. As a lawyer, he defended celebrated cases in Lebanese modern advocacy, winning landmark judicial victories on behalf of the Vatican and the Beirut Maronite Church. In 1972, he was elected president of the Beirut bar, and founded the first Arab Organization for Human Rights in 1974, together with prominent Arab lawyers like Abderrahmane Youssoufi (Arabic ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅŸä), a prisoner of conscience and later prime minister of Morocco. In peacetime, he was an influential figure in Lebanon through the respect expressed to him by the leaders of various factions and his intimate knowledge of the Lebanese political scene. In 1964, he was appointed Minister of Social Affairs by Lebanese president Charles Helou, but resigned a year later over the arbitrary dismissal of leading judges under the pretext of fighting corruption. During the Lebanese civil war (1975‚Äì90), he refused to take sides, repeating his distaste for violence, while denouncing the atrocities carried out by various Lebanese factions and the excesses of foreign intervention. His mantra was taken through the long war from a saying attributed to Renaissance humanist thinker Erasmus, \\"to be Guelfe amongst the Gibelins, and Gibelins amongst the Guelfes\\", entrenched factions in Italy's 13th century civil wars. Amongst the Lebanese leadership, he maintained a close friendship with Raymond Edd√©, Kamal Jumblatt, Musa al-Sadr and the successive heads of the Maronite Church.See correspondence with Raymond Edd√© over the Constitutional Council in Wajdi Mallat, \\"Raymond Edd√© et le Conseil Constitutionnel\\", Mawaqef-Positions, pp. 301‚Äì2; on Kamal Jumblatt, pp. 247‚Äì49; photograph with Musa al-Sadr, id., p.144f; texts on Maronite patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Khoreiche, id., pp. 266‚Äì88; 299‚Äì300. Al-Nahar's obituary on 19 April 2010 mentions that \\"in early summer 1970, ...Kamal Jumblatt suggested him in the last common meeting of the Lebanese political parties as unanimity candidate for the Lebanese presidency.\\" The official elegy of Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir on 19 April 2010 also mentioned Jumblatt and Mallat's closeness. In an article published in al-Nahar on 29 April 2010, lawyer Bassam Amin al-Halabi relates his eye-witnessing two occasions, in 1970 and in 1976, when Jumblatt proposed Wajdi Mallat for president. The assassination of Kamal Jumblatt in 1977 came as a particular shock because of their literary and professional closeness and the particular affinity that had developed through a century and half of close family ties. In 2009, he published a diwan (poetry collection) of hitherto unknown poetry by his grand uncle Tamer, including poems to Nasib Jumblatt, a leader of the Lebanese Mountain in the second half of the 19th century.Tamer Mallat, Majmu'at qasa'ed wa ash'ar (Collection of lost poems), Beirut facsimile edition 2009, pp. 7‚Äì9, 26‚Äì29. He was also dismayed by the kidnapping in Libya soon afterwards of Imam Musa al-Sadr. He had achieved a historic compromise with Sadr, the head of the Lebanese Shi'i community, over a land dispute in Beirut, where the Imam Sadr Center now stands. His office later brought the case against Mu'ammar al-Qaddafi which led to an indictment and arrest warrant against the Libyan dictator and his aides.Gaddafi charged for cleric kidnap\\", BBC News, 27 August 2008. He was a strong opponent of Israel's war on Lebanon in 1982 and provided the constitutional formula that put a definitive end to the attempted legitimization of the Israeli invasion known as \\"the May 17 Agreement\\".In an obituary published in his party's newspaper al-Anba on 19 April, Lebanese leader Walid Jumblatt criticized the short memory of Lebanese officialdom on the role of Wajdi Mallat, who \\"provided the legal and constitutional argument for cancelling the [May 17] agreement in the Lebanese Parliament.\\" \\"Tashyi' wajdi mallat fi ba'abda (Wajdi Mallat's funerals in Baabda)\\", al-Hayat, 20 April 2010, L'Orient-Le Jour, 20 April 2010. He was attached to the coming together of the Arab world in what he coined as \\"white Arabism\\", which he consistently opposed to the dark military and dictatorial regimes across the Arab world.\\"Al-'uruba al-bayda\\", a concept coined by Wajdi Mallat and developed in Chibli Mallat, \\"White Arabism\\", Bitterlemons.org, 3.3.2005, then extensively discussed, see e.g. Joseph Braude, \\"Arab nationalists react to Saddam's trial\\", The New Republic, posted 12.12.2005. President of the Constitutional Council In 1994, he was elected by a large majority in the Lebanese Parliament to sit on the newly established Constitutional Council, then by his peers on the Council as its president. Within two years, the Constitutional Council had become the most respected institution in the country owing to its fiercely independent and principled decisions.See in addition to the considerable controversy over the resignation of its president, which was carried out in the press for the following two weeks, the chronicles on Lebanese law for the years 1995, 1996 and 1997, including English translations of some of the Council's decisions, in Eugene Cotran and Chibli Mallat eds, Yearbook of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law, Kluwer Law International, London, 1994‚Äì1996, vols.1‚Äì3. Discussion of the resignation in vol.3, 'Lebanon', pp.221‚Äì27. He resigned from the Council over unfair tampering with parliamentary elections on April 3, 1997. While he never expressed the full reasons for his resignation to avoid further shocks to the country, he did say in a rare television interview that \\"the Constitutional Council came to Lebanon 25 years later before its time.\\"Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) interview with Gis√®le Khoury, in the program \\"Hiwar al 'umr (a life conversation)\\", 27 January 1999. In an obituary published on the front page of the Lebanese daily al-Nahar on 19 April 2010, Lebanese Minister of Justice Ibrahim Najjar mentioned that Mallat felt \\"there was an obstacle between him and some members of the Council, ...who were keen on pleasing political figures.\\" His pattern of resigning high government positions earned him a reputation of a statesman who was keener to protect the public position's dignity over earning it in the first place.Statement of Ahmad al- Zein, in LBC interview \\"Hiwar al 'umr (a life conversation)\\", 27 January 1999. Retirement and legacy He developed in his late years his rare literary talents into several books, including a best-selling book on his various political and professional positions entitled Mawaqef-Positions, in Arabic and French, and a reference compendium of some 700 pages on the mark of his father on contemporary Arab poetry, The Poet of the Cedars: a School for National Identity.

Sponsored by Raytheon, the ride let park guests custom-design their own thrill ride using mathematical tools, an innovative touch screen table and a robotic simulator. It opened to the public on October 14, 2009 as the first ride to be located within the Innoventions attraction at Epcot. Guests designed a thrill ride using an interactive touch screen that let them determine height and speed, while adding features such as dips and corkscrew turns. Once \\"built\\", guests climbed aboard their customized design in the 4-D robotic simulator that used sight, sound and movement to give them a realistic experience. The ride closed on September 14, 2016.  Ride overview  One of the four KUKA Arms in motion The first-ever Innoventions ride at Epcot, Sum of All Thrills, presented by Raytheon, was a simulated thrill ride. The ride let guests use a computer program to specify the drops, curves and loops of a coaster track before boarding an industrial robotic arm to experience their creation. Three vehicle options were available: bobsled, roller coaster and jet aircraft. It was possible to program actual loops into both the coaster and jet courses, with the robotic arm swinging the rider upside down. In addition to the vehicle, guests also selected the kinds of turns, loops and hills in their track design. Choices ranged from mild, broad curves to extreme multiple-loop inversions. Using computer-design tools, they could further customize these components by changing the height and width of each piece.

It is easily seen from the shores of Shimoni, Kenya. Mkwiro Primary School is the only school in the village, covering kindergarten and standards one through eight. Constantly running electricity is not sustainable, so most villagers do not have access to electricity. The community itself is a devout Muslim, thus very conservative and requires tourists to respect the dress code. Women must wear headscarves and cover their backs and shoulders; both men and women must cover their thighs above the knee. Mkwiro is primarily a subsistence fishing village that utilizes several methods to catch fish: spear fishing, ring net fishing, line fishing, trap and aquarium fishing are among the most common ways in which local fisherman will catch fish in the area. Villagers in Mkwiro, Shimoni, and Wasini work very hard together with KWS to prevent any and all fishing in the Kisite-Mpunguti Marine Park and Reserve. Despite best efforts from the community and KWS, fishing still occurs within the Park's borders. Turtle by-catching whilst fishing is also a problem, as 5 out of the world's 7 species of turtles have been spotted in and around Wasini Channel. Mkwiro also benefits from seaweed farming. Dried seaweed is often exported to Asian markets. Priced at about 15 shillings per kilo of dried seaweed, Mkwiro villagers work very hard for a very low commission. Mkwiro is also becoming more receptive to the tourism industry. On the opposite side of Wasini Island, Wasini Village is a competing tourism destination for visitors that take their lunches before and/or after dhow trips around the Marine Protected Areas, managed by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). These dhow trips feature dolphin-watching, snorkeling, and educational speeches provided by the tour guides. Paradise Divers is a peaceful and luxurious destination for lunch in Mkwiro. In Wasini Village, Charlie Claw's and Coral Spirit are the lunch destinations for tourists.

The project is then invoiced to the customer based on the actual costs incurred plus the agreed margin. It is essentially the same as what is known (especially in the U.S.) as a cost-plus contract. This contract form is popular to ensure that a competitive price is obtained, for instance in cases where tender competitions are impractical. It is also useful if the work is difficult to specify precisely up front, or if the buyer is not willing to pay for the risk-premium that sellers typically add when giving fixed prices. Frequently, an incentive is included for the supplier to give a realistic price and to minimize the costs during the project. Typically, the mechanism for such an incentive is that the supplier gets a bonus or penalty calculated as a percentage of the difference between the real cost of the project and an estimate provided up front. (Note: Setting the percentage at 100% would make the pricing identical to that of an EPCI contract). Open-book contracts in third-party logistics services were popularised by John Anthony Harvey CBE, head of Tibbett & Britten Group plc, between 1984 and 2004.

When fully grown, the larva makes an oval excision in the mine, and pupates there. The excision only drops out of the mine with the withering of the leaf.

Background  It is not known when He Quanhao was born. His grandfather He Jintao, who had taken over Weibo Circuit after being supported by mutineers who had overthrown and killed the previous military governor Shi Xiancheng, and his father He Hongjing, had successively served as the military governors of Weibo.Old Book of Tang, vol. 181. When He Hongjing died in 866, He Quanhao was serving as one of the military commanders, and the soldiers supported him to succeed He Hongjing. Then- reigning Emperor Yizong approved and made him acting military governor, and then, in 867, full military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250.  As military governor  In 868, when the rebel Pang Xun took over Xu Prefecture (ÂæêÂ∑û, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), the imperial government reacted by launching a three-pronged operations against Pang's rebels. The northern wing was initially commanded by the imperial guard general Wang Yanquan (), but Wang was later replaced by Cao Xiang () the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) in late 868. He Quanhao sent troops, commanded by his officer Xue You (), to assist Cao. The Weibo troops put the rebel stronghold of Feng County under siege, and repeatedly attacked it. When Pang himself made a surprise attack on the Weibo troops in summer 869, however, Weibo forces collapsed and were forced to withdraw and regroup, allowing the siege on Feng County to be lifted.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 251. Still, after Pang's rebellion was suppressed later that year, He Quanhao, for his contributions, was given the honorary titles of acting Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). It was said that He Quanhao, who was still described as young at that point, was cruel in his punishment, favoring death penalties, and also whipped subordinates severely for even minor offenses. The soldiers thus feared him. In 870, with there being rumors that he would decrease the food and clothing stipends for the soldiers, the soldiers mutinied. He Quanhao tried to flee by himself on horse, but the soldiers tracked him down and killed him. They supported the officer Han Junxiong to replace him, and the imperial government subsequently agreed.New Book of Tang, vol. 210.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252.

The origin of the name, Msambwe (plural Misambwe) is a hardy and wild fruits () tree indigenous to Msambweni. A few remnants of the Msambwe trees are still existing at Mkunguni Beach, Sawa Sawa Village. By road, Msambweni is south of Mombasa and northeast of Lunga Lunga on the Tanzanian border. As of 2009, the town had a population of 11,985 people. Fishing is the primary source of income, although coconut palm, buxa coloring,See Bixa orellana cashew nuts and fruits are produced for trade. Because of its reef and extensive beaches, the snorkeling industry is gaining in popularity in Msambweni, and holiday cottages and hotels have sprung up in the area, such as the Msambweni Beach House. The town is noted for its leprosarium and contains the Msambweni District Hospital. The Koromojo Dam is immediately north of the town. Geography By road, Msambweni is south of Mombasa, southeast of Kwale, and northeast of Lunga Lunga on the Tanzanian border. It lies along the A14 road (Ukunda-Ramisi Road) between the villages of Ukunda and Shimoni. Msambweni forms a constituency that starts from the Mwachema River at the border of Tiwi and Diani Beach to the north, and down to Vanga at the border of Kenya and Tanzania to the south. The area's scenery is characterized by its beaches, rocky outcrops and low cliff tops and is relatively unspoiled. At one end of the beach is a \\"rocky headland of fossilized coral, which is a jumble of cracks, caves and chimneys that make an ideal roost for bats\\" and there are baobab trees in the vicinity. There is a reef channel at Msambweni and aquifer which is about south of the Tiwi aquifer. The reef, which stretches from Msambweni to Malindi in the north, is the world's largest continuous fringing reef. At the northern end of Msambweni Bay is Chale Island, a headland rather than an island, which is known as a sacred kaya (worshipping place). Many of the locals are superstitious and believe in witchcraft and spirits (). Bedrock in the area was likely formed by Mazeras Sandstones. Msambweni has an average rainfall of 55.18 inches a year. Politics Msambweni Central forms a constituency with an elected Member of Parliament. As of 2001 the Msambweni Constituency had an area of with a population of 211,011 people. By 2009 it had a population of 288,393 people. Kassim Mwamzandi was MP from 1988‚Äì1997. The MP for Msambweni was Suleiman Dori Ramadhan until his death on 9 March, 2020. He assumed office in 2013 and was re-elected in 2017. There is an upcoming by-election towards the end of 2020 to replaced him. Economy Msambweni grew from a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing is important to the local community of Msambweni and is the primary source of income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002‚Äì2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica sand is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union. A result of its reef, the tourist industry is taking off in Msambweni attracting snorkelers. Holiday cottages and hotels have sprung up. Club Green Oasis caters mainly to German tourists. Although supplied with electricity, in the 1990s the government expressed concerns about access to an ample clean water supply in the division. Landmarks Msambweni Beach House Msambweni is noted for its leprosarium, and contains the Msambweni Level 5 Hospital, which is reportedly one of the best hospitals on the coast, and Kari Medical Clinic, Vingujini Primary School, and Msambweni Secondary School. The Msambweni Campus of Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), formerly the Matuga Medical Training College in Matuga, is located next to the hospital. It was established in 1977 and shifted location to Msambweni in August 2006. It trains students in the Health Sciences, and since 2005 they have offered a three and half-year pre-service diploma course in Community Health Nursing. On a clifftop is the Msambweni Beach House, set in 28 acres with a stretch of private beach. Although predominantly Muslim, the town has an interdenominational church. Immediately to the north of Msambweni is the Koromojo Dam. and between Msambweni and Kwale is the Shimba Hills National Reserve. There is a marine reserve at Shimoni beyond Funzi Island to the south.

In doing so, it worked in conjunction with the Music Chamber of the Reich Chamber of Culture. Degenerate music The Office was established as a result of an 'Order Concerning Undesirable and Dangerous Music', issued by the Music Chamber in December 1937. Heinz Drewes became the Office's first director. Initially, the Office's remit was to screen all foreign music before publication or distribution, but in March 1939, this role expanded to encompass all music. As this task was too great for one bureau to deal with, publishers were only under compulsion to submit music to the Office if it was requested, although some composers submitted their own compositions anyway. As part of its work, the Reich Music Examination Office published lists of 'undesirable' compositions, the first of which was produced on 31 August 1938 and published in the Music Chamber's official journal on 1 September. Several more of these lists were published. In practice, very few compositions were actually banned, as the mere existence of the office had a self-regulatory effect. Much of the banned material comprised what the Nazis called degenerate music, such as jazz or negermusik as well as the compositions of Jewish composers like Mahler.

History Originally named Dalldorf it was first mentioned in 1332. Historical infos about Wittenau In 1869 the city of Berlin had acquired land in the Dalldorf in order to build the St√§dtische Irrenanstalt zu Dalldorf (Municipal Mental Asylum at Dalldorf), today's Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik (Karl Bonhoeffer mental home), between 1877 and 1879.Michael Zaremba,Reinickendorf im Wandel der Geschichte, Berlin: be.bra, 1999, p. 99\\\\. . In the following years Dalldorf became the synonym for 'madhouse' in Berlin parlance.Reinickendorf, Axel Reibe and Wolfgang Ribbe (eds.), Berlin: Colloquium, 1988, (=Geschichte der Berliner Verwaltungsbezirke; vol. 4), pp. 69seq. Therefore, in 1903 Dalldorf applied at the Niederbarnim district commissioner for a new toponym, Wittenau after its late mayor Peter Witte, granted by the Prussian government with effect of 23 August 1905.Gerd Koischwitz, Sechs D√∂rfer in Sumpf und Sand ‚Äì Geschichte des Bezirks Reinickendorf von Berlin, Berlin: Der Nord-Berliner, 1984, pp. 81‚Äì92. No ISBN In 1920 Wittenau merged into Berlin by the Greater Berlin Act. After the capture of the district by the Red Army was relatively quickly formed again a provisional local government. This was because small groups of anti-fascists found themselves ready to take over the administration in coordination with the occupiers. In Wittenau Anton Jadasch was appointed mayor. Immediately after the end of the fighting in Berlin, the Soviet occupying power began with the dismantling of undamaged industrial plants and their facilities. The temporary British occupying power did not continue this. However, with the arrival of the French Allies as final occupying power, the dismantling began again. These continue until the signing of the Petersberg Agreement on 22 November 1949. Nevertheless, some companies were able to produce different products again as early as November 1945, the former armaments factories in Wittenau mainly produced household goods and products needed for reconstruction (the Mauserwerke, for example, potato hoes and bread loaves, the former German weapons and munitions factories now made ovens and building hardware ago). However, the industry in Wittenau, which had just regained momentum, was suddenly slowed down by the Berlin blockade in the years 1948/1949. Numerous companies temporarily stopped production, especially craft enterprises only resumed work several months after the blockade ended. The political reconstruction progressed faster: already in September 1950, the foundation stone was laid for the cultivation at the town hall Reinickendorf. Only for the period after 1953 is a noticeable growth of industrial production demonstrable. Many companies were able to expand their production at this time (e.g. Waggon Union, ZF Friedrichshafen), others were just in this time in the district (e.g. Collonil). Not only industrial enterprises settled in Wittenau, also the largest of the residential complexes for the members of the French armed forces ‚Äì the Cit√© Foch ‚Äì originated here since 1953. Several blocks of flats along the Cyclopstra√üe later followed numerous residential, administrative and supply buildings northeast of the demolished today Wittenau freight yard on the border with Waidmannslust. The location on the edge of the district and the fact that the French representatives resided in Waidmannslust (see: Former residence of the High Commissioner of the French Republic for Germany), still today lead to the fact that the Cit√© Foch is falsely counted among Waidmannslust. Even the Federal Real Estate Agency, which manages the area today, makes that mistake. The construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 also had far-reaching consequences for the Wittenau economy. As in the entire district of Reinickendorf, the number of small businesses declined and work was increasingly carried out in companies with more than ten employees. Furthermore, the public administration with the construction of the tax office Reinickendorf in 1976 once again centralized. This constellation required ‚Äì as well as the low cultural offer ‚Äì an efficient infrastructure. As early as 1958, the then subway line C (today: Line U6) had been extended to Tegel, whereby at least Borsigwalde was affected by the subway. As part of the S-Bahn boycott in West Berlin Wittenau was increasingly dependent on the Berlin subway, buses and private transport. The complete suspension of train operations on the Kremmener Bahn and the Nordbahn in January 1984 exacerbated this situation even further. The eastern part of Wittenau already had a well developed north-south connection for private transport with the federal highway 96. In addition, in the 1970s with the construction of the A 111 ‚Äì a feeder for the Berlin city highway and the Berlin Ring ‚Äì began, the complete completion lasted until 1987. With the junction Holzhauser road West Wittenau was a direct connection to the city center. In the 1970s and 1980s not only Wittenau was invested in the transport infrastructure, but also in public buildings: In 1971, the construction of the Ringelnatz elementary school in Wilhelm-Gericke-Stra√üe was completed, followed only a year later, the Peter Witte primary school in the town hall promenade. After the completion of the tax office Reinickendorf in 1976 and Eichborndamm followed in 1978, the school Am Park east of the Volkspark Wittenau. Finally, the new building for two upper grades centers was opened in 1983 in the Cyclopstra√üe, which are now run under the name Emil Fischer School and Ernst Litfa√ü School. In 1985, the new building of the Humboldt Hospital was opened on a site on the northern ditch. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent reunification, favorable building land was available north of Berlin. This and a coordinated economic promotion in the district of Oberhavel led in the following years increasingly to the exodus of young families and industrial companies to the northern outskirts of Berlin. In September 1994 Wittenau was connected to the U8 line of the Berlin subway, after already in 1992 the Northern Railway drove back to Oranienburg. It was not until 1995 that operations on the Kremmener Bahn were resumed, meaning that Wittenau has been fully connected to the two historic north-south routes since this time. The partial migration of the Wittenauer industry caused a structural change in the district to a mixture of commercial and residential. In 1994, in the immediate vicinity of the Trift Park with the construction of a housing estate started, which is known today because of its facade color as Blue Settlement ‚Äì analogous to the Yellow Settlement on the other side of the Trift Park, the terraced houses were completed in 1988. In addition, two terraced housing estates were built in the 1990s, but these two new construction measures were accompanied by various inconsistencies and corresponding protests. Originally on the park-like grounds Am Spie√üweg a replacement for the previously demolished retirement home should arise, this plan was never realized, instead, there is a terraced housing since 1999. Concluded, however, were the plans for the area of the former allotment colony \\"New Home\\", after various eviction since March 1996, could finally be laid in December 1996, the foundation stone for a row house and two-storey row buildings. Without protest, however, was the departure of the French from the Cit√© Foch, which were subsequently rehabilitated. The apartments there were managed and marketed in the course of the move of the Federal Government to Berlin by the Federal Agency for Real Estate Tasks; they should be made available mainly to federal officials with their families. In 1994, the Romain-Rolland-Gymnasium was founded here in the former rooms of the French elementary school √âcole Victor Hugo, a high school with a French focus. In the late 1990s, the Cit√© Foch experienced a short-lived recovery, especially through the opening of a famila department store in the old shopping center. In July 2001 famila was taken over by Kaufland in Berlin, in February 2006 the branch in the Cit√© Foch was closed, the near Kaufland branch on Eichhorster Weg still exists. As was feared at the time, the settlement continued to desolate, in 2011 also closed the last grocery store. Wittenau's former neighbourhood M√§rkisches Viertel was elevated to locality status in 1999. Until 24 April 2012 Borsigwalde, now also a locality of its own, was part of Wittenau.

The line 124 connects in east-west direction the districts Tegel and M√§rkisches Viertel, in north-south direction, the lines 120 connects the Wedding with Frohnau. Wittenau is connected to Charlottenburg-Nord via the M21 metro bus line and the parallel express bus X21. Even in subordinate roads some lines run, but these have rather feeder functions. For motorized private transport Wittenau is connected to the federal highway 96, the federal highway 111 runs about one kilometer west. In addition, exist with the Eichborn dam and the southern Oranienburger Stra√üe two more main roads to the south, the streets Am Nordgraben, Gorkistra√üe and Alt-Wittenau run through the district in an east-west direction. The major roads mentioned have predominantly road-side cycle paths, but in large parts they are in need of major refurbishment. Cobblestone is only present in a few minor roads; most of the roads are covered with a closed surface. In most public green areas separate bicycle paths are indicated. Especially in the vicinity of these facilities, many paths are reserved exclusively for pedestrians and serve as a connection between two roads. At the exit no. 5, it is named \\"Holzhauser Stra√üe\\".

It is found from the coast of southern Great Britain and western France to the Iberian Peninsula, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Greece and Cyprus. The wingspan is 4.1-5.6 mm. Adults are on wing from May to July. There is one generations per year. The larvae feed on Rubus sanguineus and Rubus ulmifolius. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a narrow corridor, largely filled with frass and following a vein. Now and then, a hairpin turn occurs. The corridor widens into an elongate blotch with dispersed black frass in the base or along the sides. Generally the leaf around the mine is intensely coloured wine red over a large area. There is a very long period of larval feeding. In the northern part of its range larvae from September until November, but in the south larvae can be found all over the winter until March, April and occasionally later.

An fMRI study of a subject with a supernumerary phantom left arm was done by Khateb et al. at the Laboratory of Experimental Neuropsychology at the University of Geneva. When the subject was told to touch her right cheek with the phantom limb, there was increased activity in the motor cortex of her brain in the area roughly corresponding to the left arm. When she announced that she had touched the phantom limb to her cheek, activity was monitored in the area of the somatosensory cortex that corresponded to the right cheek. At times during the experiment, the subject was asked to move the phantom limb to a location that was obstructed or otherwise unfeasible. In these instances, there was similar activation of the motor cortex but no such activity in the somatosensory cortex.

The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17 turbofan engines.  Crash  The aircraft was at and climbing when it began to descend and turn left. The left wingtip hit the ground, and the aircraft broke apart and burst into flames. The wreckage came to rest from the end of the runway at Lubango Airport. The crash killed all 130 people on board. Probable cause UNITA guerillas claimed to have shot down the aircraft, which they believed to be carrying only military personnel, with a surface-to- air missile to protest Angola's government. Post-crash investigation of the aircraft's wreckage by the Angolan authorities reported no conclusive evidence of missile damage, and the cause of the crash is officially considered to be a mechanical failure.

Life Born on May 5, 1912, in D√ºsseldorf, Kurt Lingens was disqualified from all German academies in 1933 because of his membership in an anti-fascist group of students. His father, chief of police in Cologne, Germany, was fired from his job in 1936 because he was associated with the Catholic, anti-Nazi Zentrumspartei, and because he had tried to thwart Sturmabteilung persecution of Catholics. Ella, who was born in Vienna in 1908, had a doctoral degree in law and studied medicine at the University of Vienna. When the Nazis annexed Austria, she began to help Jews, especially students she knew through her studies. For example, during the Kristallnacht pogrom, she hid 10 Jews in her room. In 1939, the Lingenses met and became friends with Baron Karl von Motesiczky, an anti-Nazi whose mother was Jewish, and who until that time had - like Ella - studied medicine in the University of Vienna. Motesiczky invited the Lingenses to live in a large house he owned in the Vienna suburb of Hinterbr√ºhl during the summer months. At this house, the Baron often hosted Jews and members of the anti-Nazi resistance, and he, the Lingenses, and other collaborators hid and provided other assistance to Jews. In summer 1942, the Nazi regime began to deport Jewish people from Vienna. Many Jews asked the Lingens couple for help. Some of the Jewish people stored their valuables at the Lingens' home. Additionally, the anti-Nazi Polish underground movement, with which the couple worked together, asked them to help two Jewish couples to escape or to find a suitable hideaway. Arrests and punishment On 13 October 1942, the Lingens and Motesiczky were arrested because they financially supported members of the Polish resistance and because they distributed faked IDs. They, some of their collaborators, and some people they'd helped had been betrayed by their \\"friend\\", Rudolf Klinger, a Jewish former stage actor who was later proven to be an informer. Motesiczky and the couple were taken to the Gestapo headquarters at Morzin place. After a short custody Kurt Lingens was transferred to a penalty unit comprising soldiers who were sent to the Russian front as a form of punishment for various crimes. While at the front, Lingens sustained serious injuries. Ella and Motesiczky were sent to Auschwitz; Motesiczky died there of typhus on June 25, 1943. Ella was assigned as a doctor of the camp inmates and managed to save a number of Jews from death in the gas chambers; she was sent on a death march from Auschwitz to Dachau and managed to survive until the end of the war. Klinger, the Gestapo informant, was arrested in 1943 after his handlers decided he could no longer be useful to them. He was sent to Auschwitz, where he died. Post-war After World War II Kurt Lingens first worked in a paediatric clinic in Vienna and then emigrated to the United States, where he worked as a psychiatrist. In 1980, he and Ella were honored by Yad Vashem with the medal of honor \\"Righteous among the nations\\". Personal life The Lingens' son is the Austrian journalist Peter Michael Lingens.

Background  Han Junxiong was born in 814, during the reign of Emperor Xianzong. His family was from Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei), the capital of Weibo Circuit. His father Han Guochang () was a long-time officer in the Weibo army under the military governor He Hongjing. Because of his heritage, Han Junxiong started serving in the military in his youth, and subsequently served in a campaign in 833-834, during the reign of Emperor Xianzong's grandson Emperor Wuzong, with his father Han Guochang, where He Hongjing joined the imperial forces in attacking Liu Zhen, who had seized neighboring Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) without imperial sanction.Old Book of Tang, vol. 181.  Seizure of Weibo Circuit  By 870, during the reign of Emperor Wuzong's cousin Emperor Yizong, He Hongjing's son He Quanhao was the military governor. He Quanhao was harsh in his discipline, and at that time, there were rumors that He Quanhao was set to reduce the food and clothing stipends for the soldiers. The soldiers mutinied, and He Quanhao was killed in flight. The soldiers supported Han Junxiong as their leader. With Wang Jingchong the military governor of neighboring Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) supporting the request, Emperor Yizong commissioned Han as the acting military governor,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252. with Emperor Yizong's son Li Yan the Prince of Pu nominally serving as military governor. In 871, Han was officially commissioned as full military governor. In 873, Emperor Yizong died, and Li Yan succeeded him (as Emperor Xizong). Emperor Xizong, upon ascending the throne, commissioned a number of military governors with honorary chancellor designations, and Han was given the honorary designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Emperor Xizong also gave him a new personal name, Yunzhong (meaning \\"fair\\"). In 874, Han Yunzhong died. The soldiers supported his son Han Jian, who was then deputy military governor, as his successor, and Emperor Xizong subsequently approved.

He was born in Ostr√≥wek, and lived in Lipinki. Later he attended school in Duczki and Zielonka. Zych took part in various resistance activities, among them, serving as a secret courier for right wing political organisation KPN.KPN As a part of many Communist-orchestrated political trials of this period, in 1982 he was charged with attempting to overthrow Polish political system. After being accused and sentenced for his alleged involvement in the Zdzis≈Çaw Karos case, between 1982-1986, he was imprisoned by the Communist regime. The body of Sylwester Zych was found at night on July 11, 1989, at a bus stop in Krynica Morska. The circumstances surrounding the deaths of three Polish priests (Sylwester Zych, Stefan Niedzielak, and Stanis≈Çaw Suchowolec) were later investigated by a Senate commission composed of Zbigniew Romaszewski (chairman) and Alicja Grze≈õkowiak (vice chairman). The investigation concluded that \\"there was criminal activity aimed at priests\\". The commission also suggested Polish secret police, the S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa, involvement in these crimes.

Narosura also boasts a large concentration of university graduates complemented by a large number of skilled professionals in Maasailand. Important community institutions include a public-run health center, several churches and schools. Geography People Economy Though located in the backwaters of predominantly semi-arid plains at the foot of the Loita hills, Narosurra Town is a fairly modern and fast growing commercial hub. Education While Narosura has remained for decades without a high school, it is probable that it has the largest concentration of post- secondary educated residents. Until the establishment of Kuntai Primary School, the only primary school that offered primary school education to local children was Kanunka Primary School on the foot of the Loita Mountain range, about seven miles to the due south of Narosura Town.  Archaeology  Archaeologists discovered an important Pastoral Neolithic site at Narosura in the early 1970s. The site was occupied by a Savanna Pastoral Neolithic pastoralist community c.3000-2000 BP.

With the Google Translator Toolkit, translators could organize their work and use shared translations, glossaries and translation memories. It allowed translators to upload and translate Microsoft Word documents, OpenDocument, RTF, HTML, text, and Wikipedia articles. Google Translator Toolkit was supported by Google Translate, a web-based translation service. Google Translator Toolkit could be configured to automatically pre-translate uploaded documents using Google Translate. Google Translator Toolkit was released by Google Inc. on June 8, 2009. This product was expected to be named Google Translation Center, as had been announced in August 2008. However, the Google Translation Toolkit turned out to be a less ambitious product: \\"document rather than project-based, intended not as a process management package but simply another personal translation memory tool\\". Google claimed that Google Translator Toolkit was part of their \\"effort to make information universally accessible through translation\\" and \\"helps translators translate better and more quickly through one shared, innovative translation technology\\". Originally the Google Translator Toolkit was meant to attract collaboratively- minded people, such as those who translate Wikipedia entries or material for non-governmental organizations. However, nowadays it is also more and more widely used in commercial translation projects. \\"The significance of the Google Translator Toolkit is its position as a fully online software-as-a- service (SaaS) that mainstreams some backend enterprise features and hitherto fringe innovations, presaging a radical change in how and by whom translation is performed\\". As of December 4, 2019, Translator Toolkit was shut down.  Source and target languages  Starting with only one source language ‚Äì English and 47 target languages in June 2009, Google Translator Toolkit now supports 100,000 language pairs. Translator Toolkit can translate from 345 source languages into 345 target languages. Google translator toolkit - Supported languages  User interface  Google Translator Toolkit's user interface was available in 37 languages:Translator Toolkit Settings Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional - Taiwan), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.  Workflow  The workflow of Google Translator Toolkit can be described as follows. First, users upload a file from their desktop or enter a URL of a web page or Wikipedia article that they want to translate. Google Translator Toolkit automatically 'pretranslates' the document. It divides the document into segments, usually sentences, headers, or bullets. Next, it searches all available translation databases for previous human translations of each segment. If any previous human translations of the segment exist, Google Translator Toolkit picks the highest-ranked search result and 'pretranslates' the segment with that translation. If no previous human translation of the segment exists, it uses machine translation to produce an 'automatic translation' for the segment, without intervention from human translators. Users can then work on reviewing and improving the automatic translation. They can click on the sentence and fix a translation, or they can use Google‚Äòs translation tools to help them translate by clicking the \\"Show toolkit\\" button. By using the toolkit, they can view translations previously entered by other users in the \\"Translation search results\\" tab, or use the \\"Dictionary\\" tab to search for the right translations for hard-to-find words. In addition, translators can use features like custom, multi-lingual glossaries and view the machine translation for reference. They can also share their translations with their friends by clicking the \\"Share\\" button and inviting them to help edit or view their translation. When they are finished, they can download the translation to their desktop. For Wikipedia articles, they can easily publish back to the source pages.Google Translator Toolkit Supports Wikipedia, Wikimedia blog, June 9, 2009.

It was the first major battle of the Cleomenean War. The battle occurred at Mount Lycaeum on the border of Elis and Arcadia and ended in a Spartan victory. Prelude In 229 BC, Cleomenes III, King of Sparta, initiated a campaign with the aim of extending the regional power of his kingdom.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 4 This was opposed by the major power in the Peloponnese, the Achaean League. In an attempt to curtail the resurgent power of Sparta, the Achaeans led by their strategos, Aratus, unsuccessfully attempted to re-capture the cities of Tegea and Orchomenus.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.46; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 4; . This failure was made worse when a vastly numerically superior Achaean army commanded by Aristomachos of Argos declined to offer battle to the army of Cleomenes.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 4 Though these failures were offset to some extent by the occupation of Caphyae, a city that had previously been taken over by Cleomenes, the Spartan ascendancy in the war was becoming apparent. Ptolemy III of Egypt, who had been supporting the Achaean campaign against Macedon, shifted his financial backing from the Achaean League to Sparta. Ptolemy based this on the assumption that Sparta would be a more useful ally in counterbalancing Macedon.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.51; ; . Battle Aratus was re-elected strategos in 227 BC and then launched an invasion of Elis, a Spartan ally. The Elians, unable to defeat the Achaeans, asked Sparta for assistance. The Spartan response was to dispatch Cleomenes with an army to aid their allies.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 5 As the Achaeans were returning from Elis, Cleomenes launched an attack on the Achaeans near Mount Lycaeum, on the border of Elis and Arcadia. The Achaeans, who were unprepared for battle, fled in disarray from the combat. The Spartans scored a comprehensive victory, routing the opposing army. They managed to capture a great part of the Achaean army as well as inflicting massive casualties. The victory was so complete that it was initially thought that Aratus had been slain in the midst of battle. Aftermath Aratus was able to use the confusion in the aftermath of the battle to his advantage. He seized the city of Mantinea from the Spartans and secured it. This success was short-lived as the Achaeans were decisively defeated by Cleomenes at the Battle of Ladoceia later in 227 BCPlutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 6; and again at the Battle of Dyme in 226 BC.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 14; ; . These victories established Spartan dominance over the Peloponnese.

Pietro was born in Piacenza, Italy in 1834, in a period of revolution for Europe. In 1856, Marubi was forced to leave Italy because of his participation in the Garibaldi movement, he moved to Shkod√´r, where he opened the first photography studio, which was named Drit√´shkronja.  Biography  = Early life = Pietro Marubi was born in 1834 in the city of Piacenza, then part of the Duchy of Parma. In young age, he was fascinated and involved in the political and social movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single unitary state. As such, he was considered supporter of Garibaldis expedition against Austro-Hungarians. In 1856, he was forced to leave his native country after being accused of involvement in the murder of the mayor of Piacenza. Trying to get asylum in the Ottoman Empire, he heads to Corfu, from where he leaves to reach Vlor√´, but without taking asylum. Shortly after staying in this city, he decided to move to Shkod√´r, populated by Catholics and a small community of Italians in the city. = Early career = In Shkodra, he decided to dedicate himself to his passion for photography, and so decided to open a photographic studio that he named \\"Drit√´shkronja\\" (meaning Written with the light). His name also changed, thus becoming Pjet√´r Marubi, which is the Albanian equivalent of the name Pietro. During the first months of staying he met Arsen Idromeno, with whom he became a family friend. Kol√´ Idromeno, Arsen's son, becomes Marubi's apprentice until he helped him to go in Venice to complete the studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti, the academy of fine arts. Pjet√´r befriends a mountain man, Rrok Kodheli, and brings his two sons Mati and Mikel Kodheli under his wing to teach them photography. The first of his apprentices will be sent to the Academy of Arts in Venice and later in Trieste in Sebastianutti & Benque photographic studio. Unfortunately, Mati Kodheli died suddenly in 1881 at the age of 19. After the death of his brother, was Mikel Kodheli who took the role of assistant at a photographic studio. Enthusiastic, eager to learn, Kel was also sent to Trieste to be trained as a photographer. = Career and photography = The first picture of Pjet√´r Marubi dates back to 1858, in which was photographed Hamza bey Kazazi, at that time a patriot and leader of the movement for independence from the Ottoman Empire in Albania. At that time, Marubi was only 24 years old and so began his career as a photographer, where he would pursue until the last days of his life. Many of early works of Marubi show the political events, important figures and events that have changed the country's history, such as the League of Prizren (1874) and the Mirdita Uprising (1876‚Äì1877). At first, Marubi photographed Shkodra's delegation attending the League of Prizren, which today is considered one of the rare testimonies of that organization. The earlier photos of Marubi were black and white 21 x 27 cm, 26 x 31 cm and 30 x 40 cm. Later taking new tripod and portable cameras, he made 13 x 18 cm and 18 x 24 cm photos. Also the collodion plates were prepared by himself in his atelier. In his works all the social classes of the country were indistinctly represented. From shepherds, to criminals, passing by famous actors or local rulers of the Ottoman Empire. Marubi often worked as a photojournalist for foreign magazines, such as L'Illustration, The Illustrated London News and the Italian newspapers La Guerra d'Oriente and L'Illustrazione Italiana. His photos were published in these newspapers to show the events of the time. = Death and legacy = Pjet√´r Marubi died in 1903, in Sanjak of Shkod√´r, at the time Ottoman Empire, probably 69 years old. Unmarried and childless, Pj√´ter Marubi left his studio, his works and everything else possessed, as a legacy to his pupil, Mikel \\"Kel\\" Kodheli. After the death of Pjeter, Mikel Kodheli, as a gesture of gratitude, changed his own last name to Marubi, keeping alive the memory and the work of his master. Kel Marubi, as he is widely known, continued to work in the footsteps of his master and his contribution in photography is as important as Pjet√´r Marubi. The Marubi Dynasty continued for three generations, with Pjet√´r, Kel and Geg√´ Marubi, Keli's son.

It was founded in 1908 at what was then known as the Maryland Agricultural College. The band performs pregame, halftime, and fifth-quarter shows at all Maryland Terrapins home football games, and travels to at least one away game each year. History =Early Years= For 50 years prior to 1909, the military-style college heard music by the Cadet Corps Drum and Buglers. Then, in 1909, the Maryland Agricultural College prevailed upon Mr. Levi G. Smith, a local violinist, to organize and conduct a band capable of playing for all formal ROTC functions. The result was a 19-piece band, which set up in the barracks behind present day South Campus Dining Hall. It played exclusively for ROTC functions for its first year, but later branched out to other school and community events. By 1927, three student bands were organized, and the bands were first recognized as an official student organization. In 1928, Sgt. Otto Siebeneichen, retired director of the U.S. Army Band, was appointed the first full-time director admitted to the faculty of the University of Maryland. In 1924, the old football stadium was built. It occupied the location where Fraternity Row now stands. The stadium was razed in 1953 so that construction of Frat Row could begin. Women were allowed in the concert bands for the first time in 1937. Mr. Frank V. Sykora, a graduate of the Imperial Russian Conservatory, directed the bands from 1947-1949. During his tenure, the size of the bands grew to over 100 members and began extensive traveling. In 1950, the football arena, Byrd Stadium, opened with a win over Navy, and the band was fortunate to gain the guidance of Warrant Officer Robert L. Landers, the conductor of the \\"Singing Sergeants\\" as well as the Maryland Red and White Band. The Music Department at Maryland was established in 1954, led by Homer Ulrich. The university hired Ulrich as the first full-time band director to be member of the music faculty. Hubert Henderson, hired in 1955, established the band in the Music Department and integrated it as an ensemble (both marching and concert) in the music performance and music education programs. He was assisted by associate directors Norman Heim, Henry Romersa and Acton Ostling, Jr. Queen Elizabeth II visited the campus while touring the U.S. in 1957. Her visit was so important that the band was given $10,000 to purchase new uniforms to be used at the football game that she attended. Henderson left in 1965 and Ostling became the director of bands. John Wakefield was hired to work with Ostling as associate director. When Ostling left in 1968, Wakefield became the director of bands. With the help of associate directors Fred Heath, Jerry Gardner, Dieter Zimmer and L. Richmond Sparks, Wakefield has led the band to be the superior ensemble it is today. =2000-2009= The Mighty Sound of Maryland forms the \\"Block M\\" formation in 2007 at Maryland Stadium (then Byrd Stadium). In August 2000, the bands moved from their old home of Tawes Fine Arts Building into the then-new Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center. In November of that year the Mighty Sound of Maryland marched in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. In September 2001, the new band room was dedicated to Mr. John E. Wakefield, Director of Bands. During Early Week (band camp) of 2006, band director L. Richmond Sparks introduced the idea of a volunteer trip to New Orleans to the band. The idea was met with much enthusiasm and excitement, and on September 9, 2006 the band played a New Orleans Tribute halftime show. After finishing on the field, each member of the band took to the stands to collect donations in their shakos to help fund a service trip to New Orleans over winter break. In the third quarter of the game over $25,000 was raised. By the end of the semester, over $50,000 had been raised to fund the band's trip. After a long bus ride, over 240 members of the band spent a week in New Orleans building houses with Habitat for Humanity at the Musicians' Village Project. While in Louisiana, the band also performed for Habitat for Humanity volunteers, at Gallier Hall for the mayor, and at the Krewe of Alla's Mardi Gras kickoff parade in Gretna, Louisiana. =2010-Present= In 2010, the Mighty Sound of Maryland won CBS's Hawaii Five-0 theme song contest, gaining a prize of $25,000 for the band program. Part of their recorded performance of the theme was also aired on CBS during the show. The band was able to purchase new uniforms with their winnings. The Mighty Sound of Maryland marched in the 2013 inauguration parade for President Barack Obama. The band was selected from over 2,800 other applicants and marked the fourth time they had participated in an inaugural parade. In 2014, the Maryland Terrapins and the band joined the Big Ten Conference, home to bands widely considered to be some of the nation's finest. The bands directors expressed hope that the move would generate both additional exposure and funding for the band. The Truck During pre- and post-game parades, the Mighty Sound of Maryland performs a choreographed cheer and drum cadence known as \\"The Truck.\\" Each section of the band writes their own lyrics and dances to The Truck, often cheering on the team and referencing the friendly rivalries between sections. When the Terps win, band members wear their shakos backwards while performing The Truck. Pregame Show The Mighty Sound of Maryland pregame show begins with a double-time Tunnel Entrance into a large block on the field. The band performs the Pregame Fanfare followed by the Victory Song while executing an eight-to- five march into the \\"Block M\\" formation. The band then performs The Star- Spangled Banner as a salute to the United States. Following the Star-Spangled Banner, the band performs a cheer while spelling out \\"MARYLAND,\\" then plays the Fight Song. The formation is flipped to spell \\"GO TERPS\\" to the backfield. Previously, Maryland, My Maryland was played during this portion, but this is no longer performed due to concerns regarding the history of the lyrics. Facing the visitor's side, the band then performs the visiting team's fight song. At the conclusion of the visiting team's fight song, the band moves to a large block in the center of the field to execute the Mighty Sound of Maryland's signature move, \\"Block and Mess.\\" The band unwinds the block in a double-time march at over 250 beats per minute, forming a script \\"UM\\" designed to appear upright from either side of the stadium. The band then performs the Alma Mater. At the conclusion of the Alma Mater, the band moves into a shield formation during the playing of Crown Imperial. Midway through the piece, the world's largest Maryland State Flag, measuring about 20 yards long, is unfurled by the Dance Team inside the shield. The formation and flag are recognized as another hallmark of the Mighty Sound of Maryland pregame show. Following Crown Imperial, the band moves under cadence to form a tunnel for the football team's entrance before exiting the field to play in the stands. Stands The band performs a number of school songs and popular pieces in the stands during the game. \\"The Victory Song\\",https://web.archive.org/web/20100527145119/http://www.umd.edu/traditions/songs/sounds/victory.wav(The University recognizes two songs.

Mars, the Bringer of War is played during kickoffs. The Bone Cheer is performed by KAOS, the trombone and baritone section, usually once per game. The cheer involves the section alone playing a song and the rest of the band yelling \\"Go! Fight! Win!\\" Once the cheer ends, the Tenor Sax Challenge begins, in which tenor saxophone players hold up their instruments from the base using only one hand for as long as they can. Another KAOS cheer is performing the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah. The band performs a number of popular pieces as well, with staples including Take On Me, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Seven Nation Army. =Discontinued Traditions= The Amen Chorus was played at the end of victories, accompanied loudly by students and fans. It was considered a tradition unique to the University of Maryland. It was discontinued in the late 80's. The tradition was revived for one night only on January 11, 2017, while the band served as a pep band during a men's basketball game, in honor of Coach Lefty Driesell. Rock and Roll Part II was played following touchdowns and other big plays to energize the crowd. Due to the student section's improvised lyrics - and the university's concerns about sportsmanship and its image - the band was forbidden from playing the song at all football and basketball games in 2004.

The 4th Coming was later purchased by Dialsoft, which now sells server licenses and continues to develop the game under the unofficial project name of T4C V2.  Gameplay  Players begin by creating a human character. After choosing a name and gender, a number of specific questions lead a basic distribution of attribute points. These questions have five possible answers. One of the five answers provides no benefit at the end of character creation, while each of the other four will increase different attributes. The final part of the character creation allows the player to roll attribute scores. This function is not limited, so a player may choose to use it again until they seem to fit; however, the maximum value of the character's attributes is limited by the player's responses to the preceding questions. Players travel through the virtual world interacting with each other, unlocking and playing through quests, battling monsters in real-time, making allies, and so on. There are no predefined classes. Equipment, spells, and skills are restricted only by stat requirements. This, with the game's dynamic stat point system, allows players to develop their characters as they wish with a wide range of variety. Characters also develop a good or evil alignment throughout the game depending on which quests they choose to do, allowing them access to different quest rewards and shops (such as evil characters having access to the black market via the Black Market Quest). At a certain level players may choose to be reborn as a seraph. This resets the character to level 1. However, the character gains an increase in beginning attributes, as well as increased defenses and an aura to make the character more powerful than before. The character also gains wings based on his or her alignment: White and gold for good characters, or black and red for evil characters. Becoming a seraph also allows the character to access many areas in the game that human characters are unable to enter.  History  Vircom first published The 4th Coming in 1998. In May 2000 version 1.10 of T4C was published which used a new interface that supports groups, private chat rooms, macros, and a grid-based inventory. In June 2003 a deal was finalized between Pole, SARL of France and Vircom to give Pole exclusive operation rights for the European hosting of the game. The game was played by over 500,000 registered players in 2002. On September 3, 2003 Vircom original CEO and founder Sylvain Durocher filed a piracy complaint in Canada.

The M6 was a 4x4 truck that was used to tow M5 Bomb Trailers around on airfields. It could move up to five M5 trailers at once. It either used a Beebee winch, a Holan Hoist, or a modified version of the Braden winch. It could also be used to tow ammunition around an ammunition dump. The truck was designated as an M6 Chevrolet Bomb Service Truck. It is believed that Chevrolet produced about 7,000 of these trucks during World War II. It was soon replaced by GMC CCKW-based M27 Bomb Service Truck.

The M6 Bomb Service Truck, unlike many other trucks in its family, had an open cab with no solid roof and no doors. It normally had a canvas roof over the driver's compartment. In hotter areas, the canvas roof could be removed and the windshield folded down for extra ventilation. It had a rear area where it could carry ammunition, since it could be used in ammunition dumps to carry ammunition around the dump.General Motors, p. 89. The M6 also was equipped with a winterization kit that included: an insulated battery box with a heating coil, a gasoline heater to heat the battery, and a petcock for the bottom of the fuel tank (for easy releasing of cold air and pressure from the gasoline tank).United States Infantry Association, p. 43. = Winches and hoists used = Before mid-1943, the M6 was not equipped with a spare tire and had a Beebee hoist, while after mid-1943 the Beebee hoist was replaced with either a Holan hoist or a modified version of the Braden winch.Hogg, p. 89, p. 131. With the winches and hoists, the M6 could haul up to five M5 Bomb Trailers at once around airfields.Doyle, p. 97.General Motors, p. 90.Farmer, p. 515.

Siyu Fort on Pate island kanga from Siyu The age of Siyu is not known, but it might date from the 13th century.Martin, 1973, p. 23 There are some other accounts that mention Chinese ships of Zheng He's fleet sinking near Lamu Island in Kenya in 1415. Survivors settled on the island and married local women. This has been proven recently by archaeological work on the island that has resulted in the finding of evidence to suggest this connection. Further DNA testing done on some residents from Siyu show that they indeed have Chinese ancestors. Gaspar de Santo Bernadino visited the town in 1606, and stated that it was the largest town on the island. Siyu's main claim to historical fame is that it through several battles withstood the Sultans of Zanzibar. In 1843 the Sheikh of Siyu, Bwana Mataka, and the new Sheikh of Pate, repudiated the sovereignty of Seyyid Said, Sultan of Oman and Zanzibar. In response, Seyyid Said assembled an army consisting of 2000 people from Muscat, Baluchistan and Lamu. Leading them was his relative General Seyyid Hamad bin Ahmed Al-Busaidy, known as Amir Hamad. He had previously been Governor of Bandar Abbas (in 1824). He landed at Faza in early January 1844. On January the 6th they moved towards Siyu, but were ambushed and forced back to Faza. After three weeks without victory Amir Hamad sailed off. In 1845 Siyu gave Seyyid Said one of his greatest military defeats. When Siyu finally succumbed to Zanzibar's dominance, under Sultan Majid in 1863, it was one of the last towns on the whole of East Africa's coast to do so.Martin, 1973, pp. 23‚Äì24 Siyu Fort is in interesting artefact in that it is a fort built by locals, not by foreigners.
