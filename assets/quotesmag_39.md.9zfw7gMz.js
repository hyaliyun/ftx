The group consists of female vocalist Jack Davey and male keyboardist/producer Brook D'Leau.The New York Times At the Intersection of Styles, Taking Some Songs for a Ride The group had formed after being introduced by a mutual friend in high school. Background One of the original pioneers in what has now come to be termed ‚Äòdark RnB‚Äô, J*Davey as a duo were raised in Los Angeles California. It was the early 2000s and the advent of Myspace that allowed their future-leaning brand of funk/electronica to be picked up by some of the most influential early adopters of the time ‚Äì including Prince on one side of the Atlantic and Gilles Peterson on the other. J*Davey were playing sold out shows and creating music that would become widely recognized as the blueprint for some of the most captivating sounds of the decade in Kelis and The Neptunes. Jack Davey (vocals) and Brook D‚ÄôLeau (production) then entered what turned out to be a stifling three-year contract with Warner Bros., where bureaucracy and an endless tour schedule lead to a necessary period of hiatus - Jack was busy becoming a mother to her newborn son and Brook was asked by Miguel to come and do the music direction for him on tour. Just enough time passed for them to miss J*Davey and understand its value all over again. ‚ÄúWe were never on a mission to stay relevant just for the sake of staying relevant,‚Äù confirms Brook. ‚ÄúI either do this now or the next time I get off tour I‚Äôll be thirty-five. We toured for eight months of my pregnancy,‚Äù confirms Jack. They were on the cover of L.A Weekly, touring coast-to coast in the US, touring Europe ‚Äì but they felt it was just them going through the motions. ‚ÄúWe both had two points of inspiration to bring to the table now.‚Äù Meanwhile, Brook was thrust into the midsts of an extremely hectic tour schedule with Miguel that would end up lasting almost three years, opening up for fellow superstars including Alicia Keys, Trey Songz, Mary J. Blige, Bruno Mars, Drake. ‚ÄúBeing on the Drake tour exposed me to trap on such a constant level ‚Äì I‚Äôve never been a trap or super hip hop guy; but being around it so intensely for that amount of time, I really got a feel of what‚Äôs going on and what J*Davey already does. But it also exposed me to great new artists like Partynextdoor.‚Äù Indeed Brook‚Äôs production on the first new material by the band in two years feels intrinsically modern: left-of-centre, dark RnB with new wave elements. That spirituality that J*Davey encompassed in the early noughties. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not new terrain, it‚Äôs just a new cast of players. The game never really changes,‚Äù muses Jack. There was a time when people thought J*Davey‚Äôs music was too dark. Now that sound has spread further than anyone could have imagined - that spacious RnB sound. ‚ÄúBefore we kind of did things backwards ‚Äì we only had a little material and were doing all these shows ‚Äì now we‚Äôd rather flood the market with material and build up towards the right shows, the right stuff at the right time. Timing is everything and it‚Äôs the perfect time for our resurgence.‚Äù And with that, J*Davey are ready to go back in ‚Äì and let everybody know that the originators are back to grab the crown.

It is a part of the Tennessee Army National Guard. Background The 194th Engineer Brigade has 19 units throughout Middle and West Tennessee providing engineer support not only to the military but also to Tennessee State Parks. The 194th has two battalions and 4 separate engineer companies and a well drilling detachment that fall under it during peacetime operations. As part of the Tennessee Army National Guard, the 194th Engineer Brigade serves a dual purpose. Under state command, the Brigade may be used to provide assistance and support during natural disasters or quell civil disturbances. As a result, the Brigade must train to meet both Federal and State training requirements. The mission of the 194th Engineer Brigade (Theater Army) is to command assigned and attached engineer units and coordinate the engineer construction activities with the appropriate command. The peace time mission of the 194th Engineer Brigade (TA), and all assigned units, is training to attain and maintain the highest state of readiness possible, and to provide equipment and manpower in emergencies as directed by the Military Department of Tennessee. The unit was activated as an entity of the Tennessee Army National Guard on 1 November 1973. This occurred as a result of the major reorganization of the Tennessee Army National Guard, which deactivated the 30th Armored Division. The numerical designation was derived from a former Engineer unit of the Tennessee Army National Guard, the 194th Engineer Battalion, headquartered in Centerville, Tennessee. The National Guard's unique 194th Engineer Combat Battalion was formed specifically to take advantage of Oak Ridgers' mechanical and technical know- how. This unit was organized under MTOE 5-111GNG01 with authorized strength of 31 Officers, 4 Warrant Officers, and 86 Enlisted pursuant to GO 60, Military Department of Tennessee, dated 15 October 1973. Federal Recognition was granted by GO 13, Military Department of Tennessee, dated 1 March 1974, effective 1 November 1973. The assigned strength on date of inspection of Federal Recognition was 27 Officers, five Warrant Officers and 77 Enlisted personnel. Colonel William R. Kinton, Jr. Assumed command per GO 1, Headquarters, 194th Engineer Brigade (Construction), 1 November 1973. HHC, 194th Engineer Brigade (Corps), Nashville was reorganized under Orders 73-1, as a Theater Brigade, renaming it the 194th Engineer Brigade, with an authorized strength of 43 Officers, 5 Warrant Officers and 98 Enlisted personnel. The reorganization is under MTOE 05602LNGO1, NGO 188, 6 October 1986, effective 1 December 1987, commanded by BG Kenneth E. Wallace. On 1 January 1996, Headquarters, 194th Engineer Brigade relocated to Jackson, Tennessee. In August 1998, detachments from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 21, a reserve battalion from Lakehurst, New Jersey, helped renovate a hospital in Bulgaria. Seabees supported the exercise in two 30-person rotations. Active duty and reserve troops from the U.S. and Bulgarian Armed Forces helped renovate the dilapidated hospital, located in the city of Trun. It serves nearly 50 communities in western Bulgaria. The joint engineering exercise, Cornerstone '98, was led by the Tennessee Army National Guard's 194th Engineer Brigade. Air National Guard, active duty Seabees from NMCB-133, from Gulfport, Mississippi; NMCB-21 reserves from Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania; U.S. Air Force 52nd Civil Engineer Squadron specialists, from Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany; and Bulgarian Armed Forces engineering contributed their expertise. Support staff included medical personnel, a chaplain, a civil affairs group, a public affairs team and food service personnel. A base camp for the troops was set up in a former Ministry of Defense building in a nearby village. U.S. and Bulgarian troops mustered, worked, berthed and ate meals together there. The hospital was built in the early 1980s, but fell into disrepair after the end of the former communist government 20 years later. It was selected for renovation due to its compelling need for assistance, and because it provided an optimal training environment for the troops. Some of the training highlights conducted by these peace time subordinate units during 1999 consisted of a BCST with the brigade's wartrace headquarters, 416th Engineer Command. In preparation for this exercise the brigade staff conducted the military decision making process (MDMP) after receiving the initial OPORDER brief from the higher headquarters. The 230th Engineer Battalion and the 775th Well Drilling Detachment conducted operations at the Western Kentucky training site. The 230th conducted horizontal en ops while the 775th conducted well drilling ops. The 212th Dump Truck Company conducted haul operations at Fort Knox in support of the 155th Engineer Company. The 230th Signal Battalion attended annual training at Camp Shelby, Mississippi in support of the 196th Field Artillery Battalion. The Battalion also supported units of the 80th Troop Command by installing digital secure voice telephones (DSVT). The DSVT allowed the units to maintain voice communications while conducting a unit BCST. C Company, 46th Engineer Battalion conducted horizontal and vertical operations at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The vertical platoon built a shoot house that was worked on during IDT and finished during the at period. The horizontal platoons built a medical gravel pad. The 913th conducted road repairs in training areas and berm repair on range 46. The various training highlights conducted by peace time subordinate units during 2000 are as follows. The headquarters of the 194th participated in a BCST with the 416th ENCOM. the 1169th Engineer Group and the 926th Engineer Group participated as subordinate units. The 194th staff completed the MDMP for this exercise with the OPORD brief to the subordinate units in January. The 194th also participated in a warfighter exercise with V Corps in Germany. The 230th Engineer Battalion and 775th Well Drilling Detachment participated in Task Force Grizzly in California. The 230th built roads, fences and culverts along the border and the 775th conducted well drilling operations. The fence was to deter drug trafficking and the roads to expedite arrest procedures. The 212th Dump Truck Company conducted haul operations at Ft Knox in support of the 155th Engineer Company. The 230th Signal Battalion conducted METL training with its subordinate units at Ft Bragg. C co/46th En Bn ‚Äì the horizontal platoons were at the Western Kentucky training site. The vertical platoons participated in a JRTC rotation with the 46th Engineer Battalion at Ft Polk, Louisiana. In 2014, several National Incident Management System (NIMS)-certified instructors from the 1st Regiment of the Tennessee State Guard provided NIMS training to 29 members of the 194th Engineer Brigade over a two-day training period.

In 2002, Bill Wetzel and Liz Barry started hanging out in lawn chairs on New York City street corners with a sign that said \\"Talk To Me\\". What surprised many was that the couple appeared genuinely interested in the subjects that were addressed and that there was no ulterior motive to their project. Wetzel came up with the idea for this project in February 2002 out of the desire to get to know a stranger. The duo spent more than three years in various New York City neighborhoods with their sign. They worked small jobs, and lived in part on an anonymous donation who provided them with one year's worth of their daily stipend, $7. They also hosted a Talk Party in Bryant Park where they shared their experiences. In 2005, Barry and Wetzel spent thirteen months biking from New York City to San Francisco, pausing en route with their sign and leaving from New York with only $2,000. As of early 2018 visitors to the \\"Talk To Me\\" website will be able to access a printable sign saying, \\"TALK TO ME\\" and instructions advising people to print out and wear the sign and talk to strangers.

St. Elis√¶us was ordained bishop by James the Just in Jerusalem, and traveled eastward through Persia to preach Christianity in the land of the Maskout, one of the Caucasian Albanian tribes (hypothetically related to the ancient Massagetae of Central Asia).

The church founded by St. Elis√¶us was regarded by Caucasian Albanians as their \\"mother church\\" which laid the foundation of institutionalized Christianity in the kingdom. On his way through the Zerguni Valley, St. Elis√¶us was martyred, and his remains were buried in a place named Homenƒ∑. They were later exhumed and reburied in the Jrvshtik Monastery (in the present-day Tartar District).Kaghankatvatsi, I.VI-VII Caucasian Albania.

At the beginning of the 19th century, when the Russian Orthodox Church had established itself in the South Caucasus, a chapel was built at the site of an old Caucasian Albanian church in Baku, by the Maiden Tower believed to be the place of St. Bartholomew's martyrdom. The chapel was demolished in the Soviet times, in 1936, in the heat of the Bolshevik campaign against religion. History of a Holiday. The Baku Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church. History of the Church =Initial Spread of Christianity in Caucasian Albania= Shortly after Armenia adopted Christianity as its state religion (301 AD), the Caucasian Albanian King Urnayr went to the See of the Armenian Apostolic Church to receive baptism from St. Gregory the Illuminator, the founder and first Catholicos of Armenia.M.L. Chaumont, ‚ÄúAlbania,‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, I/8, pp. 806-810; an updated version is available online at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/albania-iranian- aran-arm (accessed on 17 May 2014) According to historian Igor Kuznetsov, this established the Armenian Apostolic Church's notion of its superiority to the Church of Caucasian Albania. However Caucasian Albanians, in contrast, may have believed in the seniority of their church due to the role of St. Elis√¶us who according to the tradition presented by Movses Kaghankatvatsi built a church on their lands \\"earlier than in Armenia.\\" After Urnayr's death, the Caucasian Albanians requested that St. Gregory's grandson, St. Gregoris, lead their church.Kaghankatvatsi, I.XI St. Gregoris had been ordained bishop of Caucasian Albania and Iberia at age 15 and traveled through those lands preaching Christianity. He built Caucasian Albania's third known church in the city of Tsri, in Utiƒ∑. During his stay in the land of the Maskout in northeast Caucasian Albania, St. Gregoris was attacked by an angry mob of idol worshipers, tied to a horse and dismembered. His remains were buried near the Amaras Monastery (presently in the Martuni Province of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic) built by his grandfather in the canton of Haband in Artsakh.Kaghankatvatsi, I.XIV In probably the early 5th century, a local bishop by the name of Jeremy translated the Holy Bible into the language of the Caucasian Albanians, i.e. the Old Udi language. The earliest extant excerpts of translations of parts of the Bible into Old Udi come from the 7th century, and were based mostly upon Armenian translations. These translations were commissioned probably by King Javanshir. =Struggle with Persian Zoroastrianism= According to the 5th century Armenian historian Yeghishe Vardapet, in the year 450 the Sassanid King of Persia King Yazdegerd II ordered the highest nobles in Caucasian Albania, Armenia, and Georgia to come to his capital in Ctesiphon for the purpose of compelling their conversion to Zoroastrianism. Prior to going, representatives from all three nations vowed to each other that they would never relinquish their faith. Although while in Ctesiphon the nobles relented, were showered with gifts, and sent back to their lands accompanied by Zoroastrian priests in order to establish the religion in their respective nations, upon returning home these nobles were spurred by popular sentiment to hold more firmly to their Christian faith and rebel against King Yazdegerd II under the leadership of Armenian General Vardan Mamikonyan. The united Christian nations of Caucasian Albania, Armenia, and Georgia lost at the Battle of Avarayr in 451; however, at least part of the Caucasian Albanian nation has remained Christian to some degree even through modern times. In the mid-5th century, under King Vache II, Caucasian Albania shortly adopted Zoroastrianism due to Persian influence. The return to Christianity resulted in a war between Persia and Caucasian Albania, during which Vache II lost his heir. Neither side won; eventually Peroz I, the King of Persia from 457 to 484, offered Vache II peace and the right to remain a Christian, but only if Vache would allow his mother and wife, who were both Persian and Zoroastrian by birth, to return to their homeland. Vache complied, and lived the rest of his life in solitude.Kaghankatvatsi, I.X Igor Diakonov. (ed.) History of the Ancient World. Vol. 3. Lec. 9: Transcaucasia and the Adjacent States between Iran and Rome. Christianization of Transcaucasia. Nauka. Moscow: 1983 =Golden Age= Christianity reached its golden age in the late 5th century under Vachagan the Pious (ruled 487‚Äì510), who launched a campaign against idol worship and witchcraft in Caucasian Albania and discouraged Zoroastrianism. Those who propagated idol worship were physically punished, enslaved, or ostracized. King Vachagan would personally arrange for their children to be taken to schools and raised Christian. He took an active part in Christianizing Caucasian Albanians and appointing clergy to monasteries throughout his kingdom. On his orders, the site of St. Gregoris' burial was discovered and venerated.Kaghankatvatsi, I.XVIII-XIXIvan Shopen. Materials for Description of Territory and Tribes of the Caucasus. N.Tiblen: 1856; p. 431 In 488, King Vachagan convoked the Council of Aghuen in his summer residence near present-day Mardakert. During the council, a twenty-one paragraph codex formalizing and regulating the important aspects of the Church's structure, functions, relationship with the state, and legal status was adopted.Kaghankatvatsi, I.XXVI =Proselytism among the Huns= In the 6th century AD the Huns had established themselves in the North Caucasus, in what is now Dagestan. At the time of Javanshir's rule (635‚Äì669), they maintained friendly relations with Caucasian Albania. Javanshir's assassination in 669 provoked the Huns to launch raids into the country in retaliation for their ally's death. The new ruler Varaz-Tiridates I, who was Javanshir's nephew, delegated Israel, Bishop of Mets Kolmanƒ∑, to persuade the Hunnic ruler Alp Iluetuer to put an end to military actions, as the people of Caucasian Albania could not be held responsible for a deed committed \\"by the hand of one treacherous and vile man.\\"Kaghankatvatsi, II.XXXVI During his stay in the land of Huns in 681‚Äî682, Israel condemned their pagan beliefs and practices, and preached Christianity. His converts offered him to establish and lead a patriarchate there through a special request sent by Alp Iluetuer to Eliezer, Catholicos of Caucasian Albania.Kaghankatvatsi, XLV The request was turned down due to Israel already having been assigned a congregation in Mets Kolmanƒ∑. Despite Israel maintaining further contact with the Huns, Christianity probably did not survive among the latter for long. =Decline of the Church= After the overthrow of Nerses in 705, the Caucasian Albanian elite decided to reestablish the tradition of having their Catholicoi ordained through the Patriarch of Armenia, as was the case before 590.Kaghankatvatsi, III.VIII-XI This event is generally regarded as the abolition of the Church of Caucasian Albania through the loss of its autocephaly, and the lowering of its hierarchical status to that of a subordinate body within Armenian Apostolic Church. The Arab conquest and the Chalcedonian crisis led to severe disintegration of the Church of Caucasian Albania. Starting from the 8th century, some of the local population underwent mass Islamization. By the 11th century there already were prominent mosques in Partav, Chabala, and Shaki, cities that had been centers of Caucasian Albanian Christianity. Caucasian Albanians that converted to Islam were over time assimilated into the Azeri, Iranian, Lezgian, and Tsakhur ethnic groups, whereas those that remained Christian gradually became the Armenians of Shaki and Vartashen (Oƒüuz) through assimilationRonald G. Suny: What Happened in Soviet Armenia? Middle East Report, No. 153, Islam and the State. (Jul. - Aug., 1988), pp. 37-40. or continued to exist on their own and be known as the Udi people. Hereti, a Transcaucasian province bordering the Georgian state of Kakheti and under influence struggles between both Caucasian Albania and the Georgian Orthodox Church was finally converted to Eastern Orthodoxy by Ishkhanik of Hereti, Queen of Hereti in the 10th century. The religious affairs of this small principality were now officially administered by the Georgian Orthodox Church. In 1010, Hereti became absorbed into the neighbouring Georgian kingdom of Kakheti. Eventually in the early 12th century, these lands became part of the Georgian Kingdom under David the Builder finalizing the process of their Georgianization.Side view of the Church of KishThe Caucasian Albanian tribes were divided between the Chalcedonian Georgian Orthodox North centered around the bishopric of Kish and the Miaphysites of the south http://udilang.narod.ru/papers/Schulze_History-of- Udi.pdfhttp://www.on1.click/info-church_of_caucasian_albania-part-02/ At the beginning of Safavid rule There were 200,000 Christian Caucasian Albanians in the provinces of Vartashen, Qabala, Zaqatala, Mingechavur, Shaki. After the Khanate of Shekhi was established in the region Both the Chalcedonian and Armenian churches underwent severe persecution during the 17th and 18th centuries and much of the tribes converted to Islam, by the 19th century the Georgian Orthodox church was completely extinct with the exception of some Ingiloy. There were 17 Miaphysite villages left in Shekhi, and the Islamized villages Kish, Faizit, Partez, Kungut (Bash and Chshlagh), Turkish-Orban. Many of the Miaphysite villages faced massacres in 1918 and migrated to Georgia to the village of Sabatlo. In the region of Vartashen(oghuz) there were 13 Miaphysite villages left, much of the Muslim population being Islamized Udi.’ç’°’¥’æ’•’¨ ‘ø’°÷Ä’°’∫’•’ø’µ’°’∂, ¬´‘≤’∏÷Ç’∂ ‘±’≤’æ’°’∂÷Ñ’´ ’∞’°’µ’•÷Ä’•’∂ ’æ’´’¥’°’£÷Ä’•÷Ä’®¬ª, ‘µ÷Ä÷á’°’∂, ¬´¬´‘≥’´’ø’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂¬ª¬ª, 1997 ‚Äî 132 ’ß’ª =Catholicosate of Aghvank= Gandzasar Monastery, seat of the Aghvank Catholicosate of the Armenian Apostolic Church until the 19th century. The Aghvank or Gandzasar Catholicate of the Armenian Apostolic Church continued to exist well into the 19th century as a separate diocese of that church. There were attempts by the Church of Caucasian Albania to adopt Chalcedonianism and break with the rest of the Armenian Church so as to be autocephalous in the mid-10th century, but they were suppressed by the Armenian clergy with the support of King Ashot III.Andre Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Adrian Walford, Michael Lapidge. Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages. Routledge, New York: 2000. ; p. 106 After the transfer of the seat of the Armenian patriarch to Rumkale, Cilicia, in the 12th century, the Caucasian Albanian bishops no longer appealed to the former to ordain their Catholicoi. The original order was restored in 1634 after the seat of the Armenian patriarch returned to Ejmiatsin.Simeon Yerevantsi. Jambr, X.147‚Äì149 The See of the Caucasian Albanian Catholicate remained in Partav for a while. Around 1213, it was transferred to the Khamshi Monastery south of Gadabay.Mkhitar Airivanetsi. The Chronographical History, 413 Beginning in 1240, the Gandzasar Monastery grew increasingly in importance, and in the 15th century it became the seat of the Caucasian Albanian Catholicos. From that period on, the Catholicoi also were members of the household of the Armenian princely family of Gandzasar, the House of Hasan-Jalalyan. In addition to the former jurisdiction of the Church of Caucasian Albania, the Catholicate maintained control over the Armenian diocese in the Golden Horde in the 13th and 14th centuries, centered in its capital city of Sarai. Armenian Apostolic Church. The Eastern Orthodox Encyclop√¶dia. In the mid-18th century, the religious life of the Armenian community of Astrakhan was also supervised by the Caucasian Albanian Catholicate. Beginning in the early 18th century, the Hasan-Jalalyans actively contributed to the Russian conquest of the South Caucasus.Yesayi Hasan-Jalalyan. A Brief History of the Land of Aghvanƒ∑. In 1815, two years after the Russian conquest of the Karabakh khanate, the office of the Caucasian Albanian Catholicate was abolished, and its head replaced by a metropolitan bishop. In 1836, under the decree of Nicolas I which regulated the status of the Armenian Apostolic Church within the Russian Empire, the office of the Caucasian Albanian Metropolitan Bishop was abolished completely. Its jurisdictions were subordinated directly to the Armenian Apostolic Church as the Dioceses of Artsakh and Shamakhy, as well as the Vicariate of Ganja within the Armenian Church's Tbilisi Consistory. =Modern Caucasian Albanian- Udi Church= Udis\` community church in Nij. In 2003, the Caucasian Albanian- Udi Christian Community based in Nij, Azerbaijan was registered in the Azerbaijan State Committee for Religious Organizations.Sergei Markedonov. Azerbaijan: an Islamist Threat to Religious Harmony. Memo.ru An estimated 6,000 out of the 10,000 Udis worldwide live in Azerbaijan, including 4,400 in Nij. Legacy In the last chapter of book two, Movses Kaghankatvatsi lists monasteries that were established by Caucasian Albanians in Jerusalem.Kaghankatvatsi, II.LII *Monastery of Pand *Monastery of Mrouv *Monastery of St. Theotokos of Partav *Monastery of Ka≈Çankatouyk *Monastery of St. Theotokos of Artsakh *Monastery of St. Gregory of Amaras *Four other unnamed monasteries repossessed by Arabs at Kaghankatvatsi's time As a result of the ongoing Armenian-Azerbaijani military confrontation, the Armenian Apostolic Church has not had official representation in Azerbaijan outside Nagorno-Karabakh since the early 1990s. Even as late as 1997, the churches in Udi-populated locales were still closed as a result of the Bolshevik anti- religious campaign of the 1930s. Structure of the Church =Theology= The Church of Caucasian Albania was represented in the early ecumenical councils and unlike other Oriental Orthodox churches, it generally did accept the Chalcedonian Creed (a doctrine condemning monophysitism and propagating the dual nature of Jesus Christ) adopted at the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451, which was viewed as a return to Nestorianism by other Oriental Churches. Nevertheless, in 491, Caucasian Albanian bishops, along with Armenian Catholicos Babgen I and Georgian bishops at Vagharshapat, decided to reject the Council of Chalcedon. It was not so much the dogmatic formula of Chalcedon which was the problem, the creed was accepted, but the rules on celibacy and other elements which appeared to assert Roman hegemony were a concern for Christians living under Sassanid and then Arabic rule. Later the Second Synod of Dvin held in 551 also condemned the Council of Chalcedon.Zvart'nots and the Origins of Christian Architecture in Armenia, W. Eugene Kleinbauer, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 54, No. 3 (Sep., 1972): 261. At the First Council of Dvin held in 506, without ratifying Chalcedon, the Caucasian Albanian, Armenian, and Georgian churches all declared doctrinal unity with each other, as well as with the dyophysite Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches.Christian Caucasia between Byzantium and Iran: New Light from Old Sources, Cyril Toumanoff, Traditio, Vol. 10, (1954): 139. Specifically, at this council the Church of Caucasian Albania rejected both Nestoriaism and the legitimacy and conditions of the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon. As of the late 6th century, both Nestorian and Chalcedonian beliefs were popular enough in Caucasian Albania to provoke a letter of concern, dated sometime between the years 568 and 571, from Armenian Catholicos Hovhannes addressed to Bishop Vrtanes and Prince Mihr-Artashir of Syunik province. Around the same time, representatives of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem were actively promoting Chalcedonian practices in Caucasian Albania. Indeed, it is likely that because of such advocacy and possible coercive pressure, dioceses of the Church of Caucasian Albania located in Jerusalem had already accepted Chalcedonian practices and had begun promoting them back home. By probably the first decade of the 7th century, though, the Church of Caucasian Albania had already come back into communion with the Armenian Apostolic Church as a fellow non-Chalcedonian Oriental Orthodox Church. In the late 7th century, Catholicos Nerses attempted to install the Chalcedonian decrees in Caucasian Albania. According to Kaghankatvatsi, Nerses was the Bishop of Gardman who adhered to Council of Chalcedon, as did the queen-consort of Caucasian Albania, Spram, the wife of Varaz-Tiridates I. In 688, with Spram's help, Nerses managed to be appointed as Patriarch, planning to bring the country in line with Chalcedonian practice. Many members of the ruling class and clergy accepted his ideas, whereas those that remained loyal to the original teachings of the Church (including Israel, Bishop of Mets Kolmanƒ∑), became subject to repression. The growth of Chalcedonism was contrary to the interests of the Arabs who had taken over most of the Caucasus by the early 8th century, because although affirming Christ's humanity, which the Arabs welcomed, Chalcedonism was still Roman in essence and thus ratifying it was associated with territorial aspirations of the Byzantine Empire. In 705, the anti-Chalcedonian clergy of Caucasian Albania convoked a council and anathematized Nerses and his supporters. Elias, Catholicos of Armenia, followed up by writing a letter to Caliph Abd al-Malik notifying him of the political threat that Chalcedonianism was posing to the region. Abd al-Malik arranged for the arrest of Nerses and Spram, who were then bound in fetters and exiled.Kaghankatvatsi, III.III-VIIKirakos Gandzaketsi. The Brief History. Chapter X. In light of the fact that leaders of the modern Caucasian Albanian Church are considering sending potential clergy to study in Russia, its future may be with dyophysite Eastern Orthodox Christianity rather than Oriental Orthodoxy. =Liturgy= The liturgical language of the Church was likely one of the local tribal tongues, most likely Gargarian or Caucasian Albanian, which likely were in fact the same language. Caucasian Albania was mentioned by Movses Kaghankatvatsi as having its own literary tradition starting from the 5th century.Kaghankatvatsi, II.III In his letter to Persian Christians in 506, Babgen I, Catholicos of Armenia, stated that all three churches of the Caucasus were ideologically united despite each having its own language. That Caucasian Albanians probably used their own national language as a liturgical language in their church is suggested by a bilingual Georgian-Old Udi palimpsest manuscript dating back to no later than the 7th century that was discovered in 1997 in Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt by Georgian historian Zaza Aleksidze. Zaza Aleksidze. Caucasian Albanian Scriptures Discovered Towards the abolition of the Church's autocephaly, it was increasingly becoming linguistically Armenized. Among the factors that might have contributed to that are constant raids of the Khazars and the \\"lawless\\" who burned churches and with them much of Caucasian Albanian religious literature.Kaghankatvatsi, II.VII,XXIV Igor Kuznetsov. Materials for the Study of the Aghvan (Caucasian Albanian) Alphabet. In 1898‚Äì1902, for the first time since 705, the Gospels were translated by Simon Bezhanov of Vartashen into the Udi language, a direct descendant of one of the tribal languages of Caucasian Albania. =Hierarchy= The archbishop was considered the head of the Church of Caucasian Albania, and he had traditionally been ordained by the Armenian Catholicos until 590, when Caucasian Albania proclaimed its own locally ordained patriarchy. In general, the seat of the Catholicos was passed down from uncle to nephew.Robert Hewsen (1972). The Meliks of Eastern Armenia, p. 317. This continued until the abolition of the Church's autocephaly in 706. The city of Chola (possibly present-day Derbent, Russia) had originally been chosen to be the See of the Church of Caucasian Albania. However, in 551, due to plundering raids of \\"Khazars\\" (Kutrigurs) on Caucasian Albania, the seat of the archbishop was transferred to Partav.Kaghankatvatsi, II.IV In various sources, the dioceses of Partav, Amaras, Syuniƒ∑ (temporary transferred over from the Armenian Apostolic Church in 590), Utiƒ∑, Balasakan, Gardman, Shaki, Kabalaka, Hasho, and Kolmanƒ∑ are listed as dioceses of the Church of Caucasian Albania.Kaghankatvatsi, II.VII =List of Caucasian Albanian Catholicoi= Lineage was established by St. Elis√¶us the Apostle also known as Yeghishe (dies c. 79) and considered the father of the Church of Caucasian Albania. Lineage continued with St. Grigoris, the grandson of Gregory the Illuminator. Grigoris was invited by Albanian king Urnayr to sit on the throne and continued to rule until 343 AD. Urnayr had converted into Christianity in the hands of Gregory the Illuminator. Lineage continued until 1836 when it was abolished by the Russian authorities and the position of metropolitan established from that date on.

But through fine print and other hidden trick, the item is ultimately sold at above market rate. Some of the items involved in trojan horse sales include cash, gift cards or merchandise viewed as a high-ticket item, but the item actually being given away is made cheaply, has a very low value, and does not satisfy the expectations of the recipient. Meanwhile, the victim of the trojan horse is likely to end up spending far more money over time, either through continual withdrawals from the customer's bank account, charges to a debit or credit card, or add-ons to a bill that must be paid in order to avoid loss of an object or service of prime importance (such as a house, car, or phone line). Victims of trojan horses include poor people or those who are searching for bargains or the best price on an item. Many of these victims end up with overdrawn accounts or over-the- limit on their credit cards due to fees that are automatically charged.

Retrieved on December 2, 2010. \\"Address: 400 Conley Lake Road; Deer Lodge, MT; 59722\\" The current facility was constructed between 1974 and 1979 in response to the continued degeneration of the original facility located in downtown Deer Lodge. The \\"Old Prison\\" () served as the Montana Territorial Prison from its creation in 1871 until Montana achieved statehood in 1889, then continued as the primary penal institution for the State of Montana until 1979. Throughout the prison's history, the institution was plagued with constant overcrowding, insufficient funds, and antiquated facilities. The administration of Warden Frank Conley from 1890 to 1921 proved the exception to this rule, as Warden Conley instituted extensive inmate labor projects that kept many inmates at work constructing the prison buildings and walls as well as providing various state and community services like road building, logging, and ranching. After Conley left office, the prison experienced almost forty years of degeneration, mismanagement, and monetary restraints until an explosive riot in 1959 captured the attention of the nation. Led by Jerry Myles and Lee Smart, the riot maintained the prison under inmate control for thirty-six hours before the Montana National Guard stormed the institution to restore order. The facility was retired in September 1979, and the inmates were moved to the current prison. The Old Prison was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and is now a museum. Territorial prison =Facility history= In response to rampant lawlessness and the vigilante-style form of justice present in the newly formed Montana Territory, in 1867 the US Congress allotted $40,000 to Montana for the express purpose of constructing a territorial prison.Edgerton, p. 28 On 19 November 1867, the territorial government chose Deer Lodge as the site of the facility, and on 2 June 1870, the cornerstone was laid.Kent, p. 9 The original plans for the building called for a structure which held three tiers of fourteen cells, but due to the difficulty of acquiring materials, the cost to ship those materials, and the expense of hiring labor, the new building would house only one of the three tiers. On 2 July 1871, US Marshal William Wheeler took possession of the first nine prisoners to be incarcerated in the facility.Edgerton, p. 35 It only took a single month before the prison was overcrowded; by August, six more prisoners had arrived.Edgerton, p. 36 The burgeoning population was quelled somewhat when, in June 1874, another tier of fourteen cells was constructed, and the civilians of Deer Lodge were calmed when a twelve foot board fence went up in 1875.Baumler, p. 8 The prison's population continued to grow, so Congress allocated an additional $15,000 for the construction of another tier of cells, but the soft brick of the building could not support any more weight. Instead, the money went into an administration building with guard barracks, a warden's office, and a visitor's reception.Edgerton, p. 42 Finally, in 1885, $25,000 served to provide the prison with a three story cellblock with 42 double-occupancy cells which was completed in 1886. The Montana Territorial Prison was finally completed to original specifications, just in time to be handed over to the new State of Montana in March 1890.Edgerton, p. 70 =Prison life= The system of managing inmates at the Montana Territorial Prison was intended to follow the Auburn system of penal reform, a method pioneered at Auburn Prison in New York state in the 1820s. The Auburn system, or the silent system, hinged on prisoners working in groups during the day, maintaining solitary confinement at night, and adhering to a strict code of silence at all times. This rehabilitation method was doomed to fail in Montana, primarily due to the severe overcrowding which plagued the facility from the start.Kent, p. 18 Within a month of the prison opening its doors, the building was overcrowded. This state of affairs persisted throughout the territorial years, reaching its peak in 1885. In that year, 120 inmates were incarcerated at the institution which claimed only 28 cells, or four inmates per cell.Edger ton, p. 41 Inmates camped on the prison grounds, but it wasn't until the completion of the 1886 cell block with its 42 double-occupancy cells and a round of generous paroles that the prison felt relief.Edger ton, p. 43 Although the completion of the cell block meant a roof over a prisoner's head, the amenities of the facility were sparse. The cells measured 6 √ó , were constructed of soft brick, and had no plumbing or artificial lights. The building had no heating or ventilation, and, in a region which often experienced temperatures below in the winter and above in the summer, this made for very uncomfortable tenants. To alleviate the discomfort, the administration used wood stoves to heat the building and oil lamps to light it, the smoke from which combined with the stench of bucketed human waste and unwashed bodies to make the environment rank. The prison hired a physician to keep the inmates somewhat healthy but provided no pharmaceuticals; any drugs required to administer to the inmates had to be purchased using his own salary. Between May and November 1873, the overworked doctor reported 67 illnesses in a population of 21 inmates, or about three maladies per prisoner during a span of six months.Edger ton, p. 47 These sicknesses can be mostly attributed to the crowded, unsanitary conditions of the prison itself and to the poor quality of food provided to the inmates. Since the prison was operating on a shoestring budget, it had to feed the inmates with what the territory could provide. Therefore, few fruits and vegetables found their way into the diet, and the inmates made do with a menu heavy in proteins and starch.Edger ton, p. 46 Warden Conley years Montana became a state in November 1889, but the fledgling state had neither the will nor the money to assume possession of the prison until March 1890. The facility was a money-sink, costing over $2 per day per inmate to run, an eyesore, and an administerial nightmare. Montana decided to do what many other states at the time were doing; they contracted the running of the prison to a pair of men who offered to care for the inmates at the rate of $.70 per day per inmate for the first 100, and $1.00 per day for each inmate over. These men were the warden of the facility since 1885, Thomas McTague, and his partner, Guard Frank Conley. =Warden Frank Conley= Born on 28 February 1864 in Havre de Grace, Maryland,Kent, p. 21 Frank Conley set off for the American West at the age of sixteen and landed in Montana, working to create what would later become Yellowstone National Park.Baumler, p. 15 By 1884, he was a member of the Central Montana Vigilance CommitteeEdgerton, p. 69 and later became Deputy Sheriff of Custer County, Montana. In 1886, he supervised a prisoner transport to Deer Lodge, and, upon learning of a vacancy in the ranks of the guards, immediately took the post. In March 1890, he ascended to the position of Warden of the Montana State Prison, while McTague remained more-or-less aloof from the administration of the prison, focusing his attentions on the financial backing of the institution. Conley oversaw everything else and launched a series of projects which made the Montana State Prison function. =Conley builds= Possibly the most important, or at least longest lasting, contribution Warden Conley made to the Montana State Prison are the plethora of buildings he left in his wake. He believed that idleness bred insurrection, so he set about using prison labor to build the prison. At first, Conley focused on bettering the prison facility. Immediately after taking the position of warden, he put the inmates to work to build a log cell- house to alleviate the rampant overcrowding. The building housed 150 inmates in one large room in two tiers of wooden bunks, and was used on and off over the course of the next decade. Convict-constructed sandstone wall Conley waited for a few years before starting one of his biggest projects‚Äîthe prison walls. In 1893, he put his prisoners to work to construct the 20 to . high walls which extended underground for four feet and were 3¬Ω ft. thick underground and tapered to two feet thick at the top. The wall was constructed of locally quarried sandstone mined, shaped, mortared, and placed by prison labor. The walls had six towers, a sally port to admit vehicles, and a smaller portal to admit people. The imposing structure with its crenellated towers dominates the southern end of Main Street Deer Lodge and resembles a medieval castle.Baumler, p. 17Edgerton, p. 74 In 1896, Conley deemed the old Territorial Penitentiary insufficient, even after remodeling it to house 164 inmates, so he constructed the first of two cellblocks. The 1896 Cellblock bordered the Territorial building on its southern side and could house 256 inmates in four tiers of thirty-two cells, each measuring . long, . deep, and tall. None of these cells had plumbing, however, and inmates again used the bucket system: one for fresh water, the other for human waste.Baumler, p. 19 Each door locked individually, which, when combined with the wood stoves which heated the building and the wooden roof, created a safety hazard in the case of a fire. Electricity didn't enter the building until after the start of the 20th century, but this building was a marked improvement from the antiquated Territorial building. In 1902, in response to concerns over women's rights, Conley built a separate building outside the walls for his female prisoners. It was a small, stuffy building with no plumbing and a tiny exercise yard, but it gave the women inmates a degree of separation and safety they had previously been denied. This building would eventually be converted into a maximum security facility in 1959 in response to the riot which happened in that year, and Montana's women prisoners would eventually be moved to their own prison.Baumler, p. 45 1912 Cellblock from Main Street 1911 saw an extension of the original walls by . Tower Seven, in the middle of the eastern wall which bordered Main Street, became the main entrance to the prison and would remain so until the facility closed.Baumler, p. 49 To respond to the ever-increasing number of inmates flooding the Montana correctional system, in 1912 Conley supervised the building of another cellblock. Called \\"Cellblock 1\\" by guards and prisoners, the building sandwiched the old Territorial building between itself and the 1896 cellblock, now called \\"Cellblock 2\\". The building was made of cut granite and prison-made brick, could house 400 prisoners in 200 cells along two corridors of four tiers of 25 cells each, and came complete with a sink and self-flushing toilet in each cell, a ventilation system, and a door-locking system which could open any combination of doors simultaneously.Baumler, pp. 49-51 WA Clark Theatre In 1919, Warden Conley's personal friend William A. Clark, one of Butte, Montana's Copper Kings, donated $10,000 for the construction of a first in US Prison history‚Äîa prison theater. Dubbed the WA Clark Theatre, the pride of the Montana State Prison was completed in March 1920.Baumler, p. 64 It boasted seating for 1,000 people in leather-covered seats and catered to prisoners and members of the community alike.Baumler, p. 66 It hosted concerts, plays, prizefights, movies, and more. For Conley, it became an instant disciplinary tool; unruly inmates were denied access to the theater. The theater was a mainstay of prison life until its destruction by an unknown arsonist on 3 December 1975.Kent, p. 82 Though the buildings inside the prison grounds were extensive and labor and time consuming, Warden Conley did not stop there. During his tenure as warden, he used prison labor to run eleven separate ranches which produced beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products for prison use, a prison farm which produced vegetables for the inmates and feed for the animals on the ranches, and a slaughterhouse. He also built and operated a brickyard which could produce up to 60,000 bricks per day. His prisoners were also loggers, and they processed their lumber at a lumberyard and sawmill they had built. Conley also assisted the state by using inmate labor to build 11 buildings of the Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs, 4 buildings for the Montana State Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Galen, and over of roads in the State.Baumler, p. 48 About road building, Conley stated: :The work done by the men in the way of road construction is itself of inestimable value to the state and counties; and greater still are the benefits derived by the prisoners. The outside work, the absence of physical restraint, and the trust and confidence instill in each man a sense of pride, both for himself and for his work. He values his advantages and his privileges. He does not brood and ponder over his sufferings and wrongs, his failures and disappointments. He awakens to a new appreciation of life and determines to make a better future.Edgerton, p. 73 :His garb was in tatters, his beard an ugly stubble, his eyes bloodshot. He had the gauntiness [sic] in feature of a wasted consumptive. He was shackled. He was a man of stalwart frame, but his bony hands looked ugly. He might as well have been three weeks out of the world‚Ä¶For a time, in the prison yard, he acted like one who was an utter stranger to this earth.Edgerton, p. 78 Escape attempts Perhaps in response to punishment like the hole, some prisoners strove to escape. In 1902, the inmate stable boss of a barn outside the walls named Thomas O'Brien drugged Conley's dogs, used for hunting and tracking down escaped convicts, stole Conley's prized racehorse, and escaped. O'Brien ended up leaving the horse, bridle, and saddle in a nearby pasture and disappeared for 18 days, after which he turned himself in. He was paroled in 1903 and quickly published a controversial book, Infamy Immortal, describing his treatment at the hands of Conley. The book caused a minor stir, but nothing came of it.Baumler, pp. 24-26 A more serious escape attempt happened in 1908 that left Deputy Warden Robinson dead and Warden Conley severely wounded. It was Conley's habit to hold what he called a \\"warden's court\\" each morning where inmates could air their grievances. At tall and weighing roughly ., Warden Frank Conley was an imposing man, and he considered himself more than a match for the men he maintained. What his physical bulk could not handle, the .41 caliber pistol he habitually carried would.Vengeance, p. 7 He was shown just how vulnerable he was when, on the morning of 8 March, Deputy John A. Robinson admitted the men lined up to speak with the warden and was rushed by four men, W.A. Hayes, C.B. Young, Oram Stevens, and George Rock. Hayes managed to get past Robinson and burst into Conley's office, waving a knife and threatening the warden. Conley drew his pistol and fired twice, hitting Hayes in the ear. The remaining three inmates rushed in and Conley fired again, hitting George Rock, who retreated from the office. Hayes got back to his feet, and Conley shot him again and threw him into the hall after Rock. Conley then went to help Robinson, who was on the ground under Rock. Rock had already slashed the Deputy's throat and was stabbing him when Conley threw a chair at the assailant, who turned on Conley. The warden fended the armed man off with the butt of his now empty pistol, and the escape attempt was ended at the end of a billy-club wielded by Guard E.H. Carver, who had had to break through the locked door to the hallway.Baumler, p. 26 Deputy Robinson had been killed, and it took 103 stitches to stabilize Warden Conley. One of the slashes from Rock's blade had come a mere eighth of an inch from severing the warden's jugular,Baumler, p. 27 and he carried the scar from that wound to his deathbed. None of the rioters had died, and Conley made sure they were all fully healed before bringing them up on charges. Rock and Hayes were both given the death sentence for the assault, Stevens won his acquittal and served his original sentence, and Young's was extended to a life sentence. Conley oversaw both of the executions (Rock on 16 June 1908 and Hayes on 2 April 1909). The men were hanged using the upright jerker method, which used a . weight to jerk the sentenced man from his feet.Vengeance, p. 17 This method was supposed to snap the neck, but it failed in both instances. Rock and Hayes were the only two men to be executed within the prison walls. Conley's downfall In addition to the problems Conley had with prisoners, the community began to complain of his use of prisoners and the office of warden for personal gain. When he arrived in Deer Lodge, he had been a lowly deputy, but within twenty years had risen to be one of the most powerful men in the region. Through the years, he had become personal friends with William A. Clark, and through him the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, a subsidiary of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. Conley moved up the social stratus with his marriage to a Missoula, Montana socialite.Edgerton, p. 75 While using prison labor to construct the prison itself, roads for the state, and buildings for state institutions, he had also found a way to have the inmates build him an expensive warden's residence across Main Street from the prison, a hunting lodge on the shores of his private lake and another for Thomas McTague, and a racetrack where he ran his own thoroughbreds. He also used the produce of the prison ranch and farm to entertain guests like Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo, several Montana governors, and, of course, Copper King William Clark and a number of directors of the Anaconda Mining company.Edgerton, p. 88 At these events, he commonly used prisoners as cooks, waiters, and servants.Edgerton, p. 90 Warden of the Montana State Prison was not the only office Frank Conley held; he was voted Mayor of Deer Lodge from 1892‚Äì1893, 1895‚Äì1903, and again from 1907‚Äì1929,Edgerton, p. 76 a position he held for eight years after being removed from his duties as warden. The man responsible for Conley's downfall was Governor Joseph M. Dixon. Dixon took office under the promise to remove the powerful Ananconda Mining company from state politics, and, upon hearing that the warden of the state prison was heavily involved with the Company, he launched a series of investigations and audits which laid bare the extent of Warden Conley's corruption between 1908 and 1921. Some points Dixon's auditor found were: # Appropriating beef, assorted groceries and produce, cream, and butter for his private use in the amount of some $8,330; # Using over a half million tons of state coal for his private residence; # Using and maintaining thirteen private autos at state expense, running up a gas, oil, and maintenance bill of over $12,000 per year on the vehicles; # Using the prison's ranch to feed his private dairy herd and employing free inmate labor to care for and feed his livestock; and # Selling to the state (for use in the prison), dairy products and beef produced by the herd, at market rates Dixon wasted no time in bringing Conley to trial on charges of corruption. The judge, however, could find no written statute which fully defined the relationship the state of Montana shared with Frank Conley, and so could find no laws Conley had broken. In the words of the judge, \\"every act of Conely‚Ä¶was in the interest of the state of Montana\\".Edgerton, p. 95 Although stripped of the influential office of warden, Conley continued as Mayor of Deer Lodge until 1929, and lived in the city until his death in Butte on 5 March 1939.Kent, p. 23 Degeneration of the facility Immediately after the retirement of Warden Conley, the first in a long string of gubernatorial appointees, Warden M.W. Potter, strove to keep the prison functioning on a cost-effective basis. He pardoned a significant number of prisoners incarcerated during World War I and the early years of the Prohibition to keep overcrowding to a minimum and costs down. However, without Conley and his series of contacts to keep the prisoners busy, the number of extramural work programs dwindled, forcing more inmates to return to the facility.Baumler, p. 83 The prisoners were now faced with a heavily crowded living space that was not well suited to house them. =Buildings= 1932 Administration building Industrial complex Only three construction projects happened at the prison between 1921 and 1959. The first, funded in 1927 by a $40,000 grant from the state for use in constructing a license plate and garment factory inside the walls, instead went toward remodeling the old Territorial building, converting the central section into administerial offices, one wing into a license plant and the other wing into the garment factory.Baumler, p. 84 In 1932, this building would come down in the second construction opportunity for inmates‚Äîthe construction of a new administration building. The simple, rectangular concrete building bridged the gap between the older, Gothic-style cellblocks and housed administration offices on the top floor and a dining hall, shoe shop, and laundry in the lower floor. 1935 saw the last new construction in the prison with an industrial shop complex that went up parallel to the north wall, perpendicular to the 1912 Cellblock. This building housed the prison's new hospital, including an infirmary, surgery, dentist's office, psych ward, and doctor's office. Also in this building was the new license plate factory, which moved to the prison ranch in 1960, and eight cells, which were sometimes used as Death Row.Baumler, p. 88 Meanwhile, the institution's existing buildings continued to degrade. The 1896 Cellblock still had no individual plumbing in the cells; a flush toilet had been installed on the ground level, but inmates had no access to it after lights out. The lighting in the cells was insufficient even for reading; the wiring installed at the start of the 20th century could barely power a 25 watt bulb. There was no ventilation, the wooden roof had not been replaced, and the cell doors still unlocked individually. A state investigation in 1931 found this cellblock to be \\"a disgrace to civilization\\".Kent, p. 60 The 1912 Cellblock was in better shape, though it was still substandard. It was stifling in the summer, when inmates on the top tiers would throw items through the windows to create a breeze, and freezing in the winter, when inmates on the bottom tiers would drape the bottom half of their cell doors with blankets to keep out the chill. There was one shower facility for the 400 inmates with three shower heads; one for a rinse, one for a soap, and the third for a final rinse. The prisoners would step under these one at a time in a single-file line. =Administration= In addition to the outdated facilities, the guard staff was underpaid, undertrained, and insufficient to manage the ever-increasing number of inmates. Guards at the Montana State Prison during this period were some of the lowest paid correctional officers in the United States, ranked 115 out of 120 state and local institutions. Their median salary was $1200 per year, where the national average was $2000. There were no benefits and no pension plan. Few wardens of the time ran background checks on potential guards, and there was no formal training after hire. By the mid-1950s, 80% of the guard staff were retirees over the age of 55, and in 1957, there was a 75% turnover of guards.Edgerton, p. 100 In order for this staff to keep order in the prison, a re-institution of the Auburn system came into play, keeping inmates quiet, obedient, and segregated. The succession of wardens added to the low morale of both guards and prisoners. Appointed by the Governor of Montana for their pliability, ease of placement, and political stature, the wardens of the prison rarely had law enforcement experience, and none had penal institution experience.Edgerton, p. 99 Unfortunately, due to Conley's aggressive control of the facility, most of the administration of the prison rested in the hands of the warden, including the hiring and firing of guards, requests for new building permits from the state, and most of the parole functions of the institution. In fact, a parole board was not instituted until 1955.Baumler, p. 87 Many of the wardens, like A.B. Middleton, tried to better the facility, but those who did often failed. Middleton, who held the position from 1925 to 1937,Kent, p. 83 oversaw all the new construction, but he did little to ease the strain of overpopulation and low morale. Possibly the least effective warden to hold the office was Faye O. Burrell, who was warden from 1953 to 1958. Burrell had been a Ravalli County sheriff before his tenure, and was a man who prided himself on his frugality. The state actually increased funding to the prison during his time, but Burrell decreased his implementation of funds, allowing money slated for updating facilities to go back into general state funds. His wardenship of the prison weathered two riots, and he resigned under heavy controversy. =Prison life= Since Conley's theory of reform was based so heavily on manual labor, he had spent little time and money on things like education and vocational training. In the 1920s, the prison library was the only means of inmate education; the only classes being taught boiled down to English-speaking instruction for immigrant inmates. The library itself, donated mostly by William Clark before 1920, was outdated, contained mainly light fiction, and had been stringently censored by prison officials.Kent, p. 51 As far as vocational training was concerned, Conley had dealt the prison another blow by removing all his personal equipment from the warehouse, garage, and machine shop; since his contract specified that the buildings, grounds, and land belonged to the state, he had populated these important industries with his own materials to further entrench himself within the prison.Edgerton, p. 93 This left the prisoners with only industries relating to the upkeep of the prison: laundry, garment construction, maintenance, a toy shop (which made toys for children in state institutions) and the prison band.Edgerton, p. 101 In the '20s, the warden of the prison took on the role of Registrar of Motor Vehicles and obtained permission for inmates to manufacture license plates. A cell in Cellblock 1 The jobs available to the prisoners were few; between 1930 and 1960, about 200 inmates out of a population averaging 550 had something to do. In the 1940s and '50s, most prisoners spent twenty-two hours a day in their cells. The industries that were available were managed not by civilians or guards, but, due to the shortage of staff at the prison, by a system of inmate overseers. Called \\"con-bosses,\\" these privileged inmates had complete control over their areas, reserving the right to choose which inmates worked under them, how much work they received, and what they had to do to receive work at all. Since work meant not only something to do other than sit in a cell but also time earned off a sentence, this system led to rampant corruption, favoritism, and ill- feelings among the prisoners, since the con-bosses often sold positions or used them as leverage for any number of illicit favors.Edgerton, p. 102 The onset of the Great Depression flooded the prison with new inmates, and Montana state further curtailed the use of inmate labor to provide jobs for civilians.Edgerton, p. 98 In another blow to the prisoners, in 1934, the state prohibited the sale of convict-made goods to civilians.Kent, p. 59 Prisoners now had almost no legitimate, worthwhile industries to keep themselves busy, and to exacerbate the situation further, most of the prison yard within the walls had been converted into a vegetable garden, eliminating exercise as a pastime. =Riots= The mismanagement, insufficient guard staff, and intolerable living conditions led to three riots in the late 1950s. The first riot, called the \\"pea riot,\\" took place on 30 July 1957 when the members of the prison band refused to pick peas in the garden which was the prison yard. The temperature was hot, and the band members were used to being left alone, if not coddled, by the prison staff. One member flatly refused the order, which won him time in the hole.Giles, p. 77 The other members decided to work, but after one member flicked a pea at another, the job quickly turned into a foliage-destroying free-for-all. The destructive attitude in the garden quickly infected the rest of the prison, and inmates rushed from the cellblocks to take part in the destruction. The guards on duty were quickly overrun and locked into cells.Giles, p. 78 A standoff between the prisoners and government officials, including Attorney General Forrest Anderson and about 200 National Guardsmen, lasted about 24 hours. The warden, Faye O. Burrell, was out of town, taking delivery of an inmate from Indiana who had escaped years earlier. The prisoners clamored for better conditions, better food, better mail service, and the firing of Benjamin W. Wright, the man in charge of Montana's relatively new parole system. Anderson offered an eight- point program which sated the prisoners, and they retreated to their cells without bloodshed.Giles, p. 85 Upon Burrell's return, however, he revoked the program drawn up by Anderson, claiming that he had not, and would not, negotiate with convicts. The second riot, in response to Warden Burrell having ignored Anderson's eight-point program, happened on 27 January 1958.Kent, p. 57 During a tour of the prison by the Montana Council on Corrections, the inmates instigated a twenty-four-hour sit-down strike in which they refused to report to work, ignored orders from guards, and loitered about the cell house corridors. Warden Burrell ordered the lights and heat be turned off, which, in January, meant many hours of frigid darkness. The cold, hungry inmates returned to their cells and, for punishment, for a week were refused mail and access to the canteen where they could purchase cigarettes, candy, and other sundries.Giles, p. 92 1959 Riot 1959 was a turbulent year in Montana State Prison history. Following Warden Burrell's resignation in February 1958, the Montana Council on Corrections decided that, in order to modernize the facility, the next warden of the prison would be selected from a nationwide search, putting an end to the tradition of gubernatorial appointees. Floyd Powell, of Wisconsin, was chosen from the candidates who applied, and he took control of the prison in August 1958. He managed to instill some reforms before, in 1959, a riot kept the prison and the town of Deer Lodge on edge for thirty-six hours. The riot started on 16 April 1959 and was the longest and bloodiest riot at the facility. Instigated by a pair of inmates, Jerry Myles and Lee Smart, the riot would claim the lives of three people, wound several others, and maintain the facility under inmate control for thirty-six hours. It ended in the early hours of 18 April 1959 when a brace of National Guard troops stormed the facility. Then, in August of the same year, an earthquake structurally damaged Cellblock 2, leading to its destruction. =Warden Floyd Powell= Born in LaValle, Wisconsin, just before World War I,Giles, p. 107 Floyd Powell came to Montana in response to the nationwide search for a warden who would update the Montana State Prison into a modern facility. With more than eighteen years of penal experience at the Wisconsin State Prison in Waupun,Giles, p. 106 Powell arrived in Deer Lodge knowing the only way to truly modernize the prison rested in building a whole new facility; what existed in downtown Deer Lodge was far too antiquated to be worth revitalizing. Within weeks of taking charge of the prison, Powell summoned his friend and subordinate, Ted Rothe, from Wisconsin to be his deputy warden.Giles, p. 113 Between the two of them, Powell and Rothe began a series of reforms which were targeted at updating the facility. They began to abolish the \\"con-boss\\" system,Baumler, p. 92 improved inmate food quality by instilling a \\"Take all you want, but eat all you take\\" policyGiles, p. 166 and by supplying condiments on the tables.Giles, p. 300 They also sought to crack down on the rampant drug use and black market inside the wallsGiles, p. 115 and began performing exhaustive background checks on the prisoners,Giles, p. 142 a practice that was not standard operating procedure until Powell's tenure. A training regimen for the guards was also instilled, which bettered communication between shifts and cut back on guard contributions to the black market. Something they were unable to initiate until too late was the removal of firearms from the cellblocks; Powell and Rothe wanted to completely sweep both cellblocks of the rifles the guards carried on the catwalks. They saw the .30-30 Winchester rifles' presence as an instigator for inmate uprising, but the guards refused to surrender the guns. Though the pair from Wisconsin were doing their best to better the conditions in the prison, they felt heavy resistance from both inmates and guards who had flourished under the previously lax security, as well as from the population of Montana who viewed any improvement in the quality of life of an inmate nothing more than coddling convicts. In his own words in a report to the Board of Prison commissioners, Powell stated: :To bring about the tremendous change needed to make the Montana correctional system a workable, valuable, efficient, adequate activity is an almost insurmountable job, particularly trying to do it in a grossly inadequate physical plant and with a lack of trained personnel.Giles, p. 120 Although Powell and Rothe meant well with their reforms, their alteration of the power structures within the facility led to a bloody riot which started on 16 April 1959. =Leaders of the riot= Jerry Myles The primary leader of the riot, Jerry Myles was born in Sioux City, Iowa, on 15 January 1915 under the name Donald Groat. His mother was an unmarried transient who quickly put her son up for adoption.Giles, p. 23 By the time he was sixteen, he was in reform school, and for the rest of his life he would spend more time inside correctional facilities than outside them. Described as having an \\"emotionally unstable, psychopathic personality\\"Giles, p. 50 by psychiatrist Romney Ritchey at Alcatraz, Jerry Myles nonetheless had a genius intellect, scoring 125 and 147 on intelligence tests in AtlantaGiles, p. 29 and Montana,Giles, p. 155 respectively. Using suicide attempts, petty disturbances, and sexual deviancy, he strove to become the center of attention. He was an institutionalized career prisoner, often committing small acts of burglary to get sentenced to more prison time whenever he found himself free, and, once incarcerated, struggled to be noticed. On 4 December 1944, he organized a mutiny at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia on the grounds of poor medical care, no church services, and having to wait in line in the mess hall with \\"the German intake and the Negro intake\\".Giles, p. 45 After the mutiny, the administration at USP Atlanta declared Jerry Myles to be incorrigible and a danger to the security of their prison. They determined that their facilities were insufficient to fully monitor Myles' activities, so on 8 May 1945 they transferred him to the federal penitentiary at Alcatraz.Giles, p. 48-49 Jerry Myles would spend about seven years at Alcatraz between 1945 and 1952, after which he was transferred to Leavenworth.Giles, p. 56 While Jerry was at The Rock, the legendary \\"Battle of Alcatraz\\" occurred on 2 May 1946, and Myles, while he did not take part in the escape attempt, learned much from the methods of Bernard Coy, who initiated the riot. The disturbance Myles would later start in Montana shared many elements with the Battle of Alcatraz.Giles, p. 357 Myles was released from Leavenworth on 3 March 1952,Giles, p. 57 after which he finished his sentence at the Georgia State Penitentiary and was released in May 1958.Giles, p. 58 During his long prison tenure, Myles had learned of a prison in Montana where the convicts ran the industries, and Myles was interested in what he viewed was a place where he could have power.Giles, p. 59 After his release, Myles bought a bus ticket to Butte, about from Deer Lodge, where he was arrested for burglary. He was sentenced to five years at the Montana State Prison and arrived in Deer Lodge in June 1958.Giles, pp. 134-135 Since the prison at that time was not in the habit of running background checks on incoming prisoners, his previous penal experience went unnoticed, and he was assigned to a cell in the general population. Myles quickly rose to the position of con-boss of the garment shop, due to his experience in similar places in other penitentiaries around the country and the notoriety of his experience in USP Atlanta, Leavenworth, and, of course, Alcatraz.Giles, p. 139 He used the position to his advantage, decorating his apartment-like cell in the garment shop with niceties and manipulating young inmates into providing him with sexual favors for work in the factory. When Warden Powell abolished the con-boss system in October 1958, Myles was stripped of his favor in the prison community and started acting out, which earned him time in segregation. He had a short, heated interview with Deputy Warden Rothe in which Myles took an intense dislike to Rothe and threatened his life. Rothe sentenced Myles to isolation, or the hole, for an indefinite amount of time followed by a longer stint in segregation.Giles, p. 153 A cell in Siberia Walter Jones, the prison's newly graduated sociologist,Giles, p. 143 recognized the danger Myles represented and suggested further segregation in Siberia in the base of the northern towers of Cellblock 1.Giles, p. 154 The area known as Siberia was separated from the rest of the prison yard by a razor-wire topped chain-link fence and was used to keep known troublemakers apart from the rest of the population. The cells were cramped, cold, and isolated. Rothe rejected this treatment of Myles, claiming that he wanted to gain inmate trust by showing equal rights to all prisoners regardless of their past activities.Giles, p. 186 On 27 February 1959, Rothe released Myles back into the general population and assigned him to the water crew‚Äîthe group of inmates who emptied toilet buckets from Cellblock 2 and the guard towers.Giles, p. 156 In April of that same year, Myles would incite the riot. Lee Smart and George Alton Lee Smart was born in 1940 in Washington State and lived 17 years before being sentenced to thirty years confinement to the Montana State Prison for the second-degree murder of traveling salesman Charles Ward outside of Browning, Montana on 28 April 1956. Smart had bludgeoned Ward to death with a pair of lineman's pliers and robbed him of $100 cash. Smart was almost . tall and weighed 147 pounds, wore a ducktail haircut, a black leather jacket, and had tattooed arms and chest. He and a friend had escaped from a reformatory camp in Cedar Creek, Washington, on 14 April 1956. The two then went on a two-week criminal binge which ended in Great Falls, Montana. Lee Smart left his friend in Great Falls and went north, where he ended up killing Ward.Giles, pp. 121-128 Once inside the walls of the Montana State Prison, Smart eventually found his place playing drums for the prison band.Giles, p. 129 Though one of the youngest convicts in Montana, he had fallen in with a relatively powerful group of convicts‚Äîthe \\"band gang\\" was the largest trafficker of narcotics in the prison.Giles, p. 147 Lee became a regular member of the cadre, and his crime of murder gave him standing among the inmates, most of whom were incarcerated for larceny. One of the inmates who was highly impressed by Smart's haughty, impulsive nature was Jerry Myles, who befriended the boy. Smart got in trouble a few times, once for being in possession of a weapon, once over his haircut (which led him to receive a buzz cut by an inmate barber), and again over having an illicit weapon (which earned him time in isolation).Giles, p. 131 Since the prison had no system of segregating inmates based on age, crime, or sexual proclivities, Smart was housed in general population where his youthful frame became an instant target for older, predatory cons. His crime of murder and connection with the band gang lent him a modicum of notoriety, but he still felt obliged to hire George Alton, a known troublemaker, for protection at the cost of ten dollars a month. Alton, who had been in and out of prison since 1952, regularly sold protection services to newer inmates who could not fight for themselves.Giles, pp. 146-147 A diminutive, wiry Montanan, Alton was well respected by guards and inmates alike, known for his vicious left hook and his prowess in the prizefighting ring, held weekly in the WA Clark Theatre. Alton and Smart became friends and eventual cellmates, until Alton was moved outside the walls into minimum security housing. Taking full advantage of his \\"trusty\\" status, Alton escaped with a fellow inmate in a prison vehicle marked \\"Registrar of Motor Vehicles\\" on 26 August 1958, the day after Floyd Powell started his job as warden. The two prisoners waved to the new warden on their way past the prison, and Powell waved back. By the time the warden realized what had happened, Alton and his confederate were too far away to do anything.Giles, pp. 132-133 Alton managed to stay hidden until November 1958, when he was apprehended in his hometown of Culbertson. He was remanded to the prison and spent time in the hole, then more time in segregation.Giles, 152 It was during this time that he met, and had extensive conversations with, Jerry Myles, who had been placed in the cell right next to Alton's in segregation. =Preparations= Interior of Cellblock 1, showing proximity of cell tier and catwalk Jerry Myles knew that timing would play a major factor in the successful initiation of the riot. Between the time he was released back into general population in February 1958 until he decided to start the riot, he paid close attention to the movements of the guards and found a loophole in their routine; each day during the dinnertime turnover, the ratio of guards to inmates was decreased in Cellblock 1. His plan was to seize a rifle from one of the guards who walked the catwalk outside his cell when the guard was alone. The catwalk was close to the tier of cells. Guards routinely moved between the catwalk and the tiers by little more than hopping from one to the other; since neither walkway was caged, the maneuver was simple.Giles, p. 194 Myles also needed to recruit other inmates to his cause but limit the number of prisoners who knew specifics to ensure the administration would be caught unaware. He chose to let Lee Smart in on the plans, coaxing the boy along with promises of freedom and adventure.Giles, p. 189-190 George Alton, a shrewd, intelligent man, was less easily convinced, though a workable escape plan attracted him.Giles, p. 190 Myles needed Alton because of his rapport with the inmate population. Alton also worked in the prison garage and had access to gasoline, a crucial part of Myles' plans. Myles assured Alton that they would use Deputy Warden Rothe as a shield and hostage to gain exit from Tower 7, and from there to freedom. Myles also strong-armed Harold Laureys, a known lockpicker, or \\"gopher man\\" in prison lingo, into being ready for an escape attempt, but gave him few specifics other than that.Giles, 184 Myles, Smart, and Alton constructed a reservoir in one of the shelves in Smart's cell, and Alton regularly filled that space with gasoline he smuggled out of the garage. The trio waited until they had filled the container before enacting their plans. =Start of the riot= At about 3:30 p.m. on 16 April 1959, guard Gus Byars was alone on the catwalk of Cellblock 1 across from where Myles and Smart were loitering. Byars turned to open a window to the brisk spring wind when he heard someone call his name. He turned into a splash of gasoline which hit him in the face and chest, soaking his shirt.Giles, p. 200 Lee Smart had tossed the gasoline as Jerry Myles lit a match to a torch he had constructed from a mop. He thrust the mop at the guard, who froze in fear. Smart and Alton lit a broom and tossed it onto the catwalk behind Byars, who, with his vision blurred by the gasoline, saw he was surrounded by fire. He quickly surrendered his keys and rifle and allowed himself to be led to the hole.Giles, p. 201, 205 While Myles, Smart, and Alton were securing the rifle and keys, other inmates ambushed the only other two guards in Cellblock 1, threatening them with knives. The guards surrendered their keys and were also led to the hole.Giles, p. 203-204 At this point, the inmates were in full possession of three guards, a rifle, and keys to the facility, though they still had no ammunition for the weapon. They quickly moved over to Cellblock 2, where they knew the ammunition was stored, and were in possession of that building within minutes, even after a tense standoff between a guard holding a loaded rifle and an inmate with a knife. The guard hesitated and received a slashed hand in return. Had he fired on the inmate, the riot may not have progressed. As it was, the inmates were now in control of two rifles, seventeen rounds of ammunition, and both cellblocks.Giles, p. 217 Over the course of the next ten to fifteen minutes, several more guards would walk into Cellblock 1, be immediately and quietly overwhelmed, and led into the hole. =Death of Deputy Warden Rothe= By 4:00, Myles, Smart, and Alton had control over the whole facility except for the minimum security housing outside the southern wall and the upper floor of the administration building, called \\"Inside Administration.\\" This portion of the facility housed offices for the warden, the deputy warden, the sociologist, and other prison infrastructure. The only woman working within the prison walls, Babe Lightfoot, held an office in Inside Administration, but by the time the rioters reached this area of the prison, she had already evacuated upon orders from an inmate.Giles, p. 225 Ted Rothe had been across the street attending a meeting with Warden Powell and some architects who were designing the new facility Powell wanted to build. Rothe returned to his desk inside the prison at a few minutes before 4:00, oblivious to the inmate takeover. To this point, there had been almost no noise, few scuffles, and no casualties. He chatted with a guard for a few minutes before sitting behind his desk, which was in view of the door where inmates came to receive their medication. Myles, Smart, and a third inmate named Toms came up to the door, where Myles asked to receive some pills for his migraines. The guard on duty, Officer Cox, turned to retrieve them as another guard opened the door to let a third guard out. As soon as the door opened, Myles rushed through, brandishing a meat cleaver he had acquired from the kitchens. Toms threatened the other guards with a knife, and they allowed themselves to be herded into a nearby lavatory. Myles burst into Deputy Warden Rothe's office and attacked Rothe with the cleaver. Rothe deflected the blow with a plywood letterbox.Giles, pp. 229-230 The struggle continued for a few seconds. Cox grabbed a chair and raised it to hit Myles, but Lee Smart unveiled the rifle he had had wrapped in a cone of leather and fired once, hitting Rothe in the chest, killing him instantly. Myles turned on Cox and slashed with his cleaver, slicing Cox along his arm.Giles, p. 233 The inmates quickly herded the guards into the lavatory, along with a civilian mail-sorter, and locked them in. Another guard, Officer Simonsen, was coming up the steps to Inside Administration, and Myles and Smart took him hostage and had him call the warden.Giles, p 235 =Warden Powell as hostage= At a little after 4:00, Officer Simonsen phoned Warden Powell, who was across the street at his residence. Simonsen told the warden there was a disturbance inside the prison and that someone had been knifed.Giles, p. 236 Under duress from Myles and Smart, the officer told the warden little else, and Powell rushed through Tower 7 along with two guards to see what the \\"disturbance\\" was. As soon as he entered Inside Administration, he was yanked through the doorway. His escort realized something was wrong and retreated, escaping back through Tower 7. The guards on top of this tower knew something was wrong and had tried to warn the warden, but the blustery spring wind had obliterated their words.Giles, p. 238 Inside, Warden Powell came face-to-face with Myles and Smart, who immediately forced Powell to call Governor Aronson in Helena. Aronson, however, was out of town and would not return until about 6:30 that evening. Powell left a message with the governor's secretary to have Aronson call Powell at Number 8 as soon as he returned. \\"Number 8\\" was a pre-arranged warning that told the governor that Warden Powell had been compromised and that Aronson should not return the call.Giles, p. 241 After the call, Powell managed to convince Myles that Cox and Rothe needed medical attention and should be allowed to leave the facility. Myles agreed, and an ambulance collected the bleeding guard and the deceased deputy warden. Powell also attempted to talk the ringleaders into discontinuing the riot to no avail.Giles, p. 242 While Myles and Smart coerced guards and wardens to make telephone calls, Alton, armed with the second rifle, set about securing the remaining guards and administrators of the facility. By 4:30, he had locked 20 men into the hole, including sociologist Walter Jones.Giles, p. 246 At a few minutes before 5:00, Myles and Smart led Warden Powell and the other four hostages down to the mess hall, and from there led the hostages into cells in Cellblock 1.Giles, p. 252 Warden Powell sat under guard on one of the mess halls, where he was offered coffee and cake by an inmate. He accepted, and he ate while the rest of the hostages were led from the hole and placed in cells in \\"Cook's Row\\" where the kitchen workers were housed.Giles, p. 254 At about 6:20, the inmates led Powell back to Inside Administration to wait for Governor Aronson's call, which never came.Giles, p. 256 Myles and Smart became anxious and left, leaving Powell in the care of Walter Trotchie, who had orders to kill the warden with a kitchen knife at 8:00 if the governor didn't call. 8:00 came and went, and, instead of killing Powell, Trotchie surrendered his weapon and freed the warden, who offered amnesty to any prisoner who wanted to retreat to minimum security. Six inmates agreed to go, including Trotchie, and Warden Powell escaped the prison, secured the inmates who had come with him, and began managing the handling of the riot from outside .Giles, p. 259-260 =Negotiations and a new escape plan= Myles was angry when he discovered that Powell had escaped, but his rage was abated when he realized they had Walter Jones as a hostage. Myles viewed Jones as one of the reasons he had been ousted as a con-boss. Jones managed to talk Myles out of murdering him by offering himself as a negotiator for the demands of the inmates.Giles, p. 266 Meanwhile, Alton approached Myles with the argument that since Deputy Warden Rothe had been shot and killed, their escape plan was now null. Myles acknowledged that the original plan had failed, so he forwarded the idea of tunneling under the walls. He chose a place in the northwestern tower of Cellblock 1Giles, p. 268 and put a team of inmates, eventually including the kitchen staff, to work with picks and shovels. The progress on this tunnel would continue for the remainder of the riot, but was doomed to fail. Warden Conley had built the cellblocks and the walls specifically to keep inmates from tunneling, and his designs proved effective.Giles, p. 336 Outside the walls, Warden Powell was busy trying to deal with budding public reaction to the riot. The word had leaked quickly, and wives of guards who were hostages started showing up at his house. Powell decided to again enter the prison through the tunnel system which gave access to the gun ports in the mess hall and the catwalks in the cellblocks. Luckily, the riot leaders had been unable to secure a key to the access points to this tunnel system, or else Powell may have been taken hostage again. Just after sundown, Powell made his way through the tunnels to the mess hall and shouted for Myles and Smart. Myles showed up, leading Jones with a knife at his throat.Giles, p. 273 Powell asked what Myles wanted, and received a verbal tirade from Myles, who stalked away, leaving Jones with Alton. Powell was told that Myles wanted at least thirty members of the press to come inside the prison, take pictures of the conditions and speak with the inmates. Powell offered to get three reporters inside the walls under the understanding that they would not print a word of what they learned until the hostages were released. Alton agreed to the plan. Powell returned to his residence to await the coming day.Giles, p. 274 Meanwhile, National Guard forces were consolidating at Trask Hall, the gymnasium of Montana's first college campus, just four blocks from the prison.Giles, p. 276 Members of the press were converging upon the warden's residence, and the city and county switchboards were becoming overrun with calls regarding the riot,Giles, 282 some as far away as London, England. By the next day, reporters from magazines like Life and TIME descended upon the town, and Deer Lodge's prison riot made international news.Edgerton, p. 104 After midnight, Myles summoned Jones to talk to the media. Through Jones, Myles warned that any offensive action against the prison would end in the killing of the hostages by fire, hanging, or stabbing. Myles then spoke up, telling the amassed media that he was fighting for better conditions and just wanted to be heard. He again threatened the hostages with death if any action was taken against the prison and paraded Jones in front of the windows with a knife at his throat to make his point. Afterward, Myles led Jones back to a cell.Giles, 294-296 At midmorning on Friday, Myles and Smart allowed Jones to exit the prison walls to escort the three reporters, one from the Associated Press, another from United Press International, and the third from radio station KREM of Spokane, Washington.Giles, p. 298 Myles allowed Jones eight minutes to return with the media before he threatened to begin killing hostages. Jones met with the warden and the reporters outside Tower 7 and managed to get the reporters into the mess hall inside his eight-minute window. Only seven inmates met with the reporters, one of which was George Alton, but neither Jerry Myles or Lee Smart took part in the interview. Jones remained to assist the prisoners with their statements.Giles, p. 299 The reporters recorded a plethora of complaints ranging from the sanitation in Cellblock 2 to the use of the hole as a disciplinary tool, but the most common grievance was the parole system. The inmates demanded the resignation of Benjamin Wright, the same man the convicts had asked to have fired during the pea riot of 1957. The reporters were allowed to leave the prison without incident, and Warden Powell announced that he expected to have the hostages released as per the agreement he had made with Alton. Myles, however, demanded more reporters come inside the facility to take pictures, and he stated that nobody would be allowed to leave until he saw the story in print.Giles, p. 301 Powell, on the other hand, would not re-negotiate a deal. Since Myles refused to release guards, Powell refused to allow the story to run. This started a twenty-four-plus hour standoff in which Myles railed openly to the media outside the walls;Giles, pp. 302-303 Alton retired to his cell after an argument with Myles, convinced that no escape was forthcoming;Giles, pp. 301, 304 Jones was again allowed to leave the prison to negotiate with Powell and, under orders from the warden, did not return;Giles, p. 305 and the hostages survived repeated threats of death by fire, rope, or knife. The hostages were eventually crowded into three cells, and the frightened men planned to press the thin prison mattresses against the bars to ward off any attack, but they knew the shield would not hold long against fire or at all against the rifles.Giles, p. 325 Governor Aronson, still in Helena, continued to refuse to negotiate with the prisoners, saying: :(I am)‚Ä¶standing firm on my original statement that I have no intention to go to Deer Lodge or to talk to any of the rebellious convicts until order has been restored, all hostages released unharmed and convicts back in their cells.Kent, 74 =End of the riot= Bazooka damage to Cellblock 1 Thirty-six hours after Myles, Smart, and Alton pitched gasoline at a guard to start the riot, the Montana National Guard ended the riot. At about 4:45 a.m. on 18 April 1959, Bill Rose of the National Guard fired a World War II bazooka at the southwest tower of Cellblock 1Giles, pp. 361-363 while Highway Patrolman Bob Zaharko fired a Thompson submachine gun through a window which had been identified as where Myles and Smart were hiding on the northeast tower of Cellblock 1.Giles, p. 365 The media had been placed under watch to ensure they did not leak news of the attack to the inmates, who were listening to the radio inside the prison. While Rose and Zaharko rained ordnance on Cellblock 1, a contingent of seven teams of National Guard waited outside the door to the women's prison on the western wall of the prison.Giles, p. 368 As soon as the first bazooka round hit Cellblock 1, they burst through the door and split up, some rushing the main entrance to Cellblock 1, others going to Cellblock 2, and more circling around to storm Inside Administration. View into prison from northeast door The team that invaded Cellblock 1 had to burst through two barricaded doorsGiles, p. 375 before gaining access to the tiers of cells. Most of the inmates were already in their cells and did not give the Guardsmen any problems. The soldiers filed up to where the hostages were kept and freed them, escorting them through the door into the minimum security facility in the northeast corner of the wall. All the hostages emerged unharmed.Giles, pp. 378-379 Back in Cellblock 1, a team of Guardsmen entered the tower where Myles and Smart were hiding. The soldiers had to push past a pile of rubble which had been removed from the unsuccessful tunneling attempt as they made their way up the stairs. During their ascent, Jerry Myles managed to shoot Lieutenant Francis \\"Russ\\" Pulliam in the arm, who was removed and remanded to the hospital at Fort Harrison in Helena.Giles, pp. 381-382 Just after Pulliam was shot, a third bazooka round exploded against the tower, followed by tear gas canisters fired from the walls. Moments after the gas began to take effect, Myles and Smart fully ended the riot with a murder-suicide.Kent, p. 76 =Aftermath= In an interview for TIME Magazine which ran just after the riot, Warden Floyd Powell said, \\"Things are going to get a lot tougher around here.\\" As soon as official control returned to the prison, the prison guards and National Guard soldiers locked all 438 inmates inside their cells and began a systematic search of the facility. Tier by tier, the guards removed the prisoners from their cells, had them strip down and stand naked in the prison yard while National Guardsmen removed all personal effects from the cells. The prisoners were subjected to cavity searches,Giles, p. 403 and many, including George Alton, had the dead bodies of Myles and Smart paraded in front of them before the cadavers were surrendered to the coroner.Giles, p. 396 In their search of the cellhouses, the guards found 382 knives and had to haul away other contraband to the city dump in several 2¬Ω ton truck loads.Giles, p. 404 Anti- suicide cell with angled bar Cell door in maximum security with screen Warden Powell decided that severe segregation for the remaining instigators of the riot was in order, so he moved the women prisoners out of their building and into housing across the street. They would eventually end up in the Montana Women's Prison in Billings, Montana. He converted the small building into a maximum security facility which had twenty-four high security and disciplinary cells.Baumler, p. 94 George Alton spent two years in one of these cells,Giles, 440-441 which, at the time, did not have plumbing. Inmates were provided a \\"honey bucket\\", and it was common practice for recalcitrant inmates to slosh the contents of this waste bucket at passing guards, which led to the installation of screens or wooden doors outside the bars. Two cells were installed with an angled bar along one wall to which an inmate could be hand- and ankle-cuffed to prevent him from suicide attempts, and two more were converted into \\"black box\\" cells, much like the hole had been.Baumler, 95 In the years that followed the riot, Floyd Powell strove to provide the state of Montana with a new facility. The riot had raised awareness of the need for reform, but a five million dollar bond issue put to the citizens of the state failed by a resounding 70%. A large earthquake damaged Cellblock 2 on 17 August 1959, and the antiquated building was condemned. Its destruction kept inmates busy for a few weeks, but led to severe overcrowding in Cellblock 1. In 1961, Governor Nutter curtailed the construction of new state buildings and the state government cut funding to the prison in the amount of $500,000. Warden Floyd Powell resigned in February 1962, a \\"distraught and frustrated man\\".Kent, p. 77 Last years Horsehair bridle with snaffle bit, made at Montana State Prison ca. 1960 In the twenty years between 1959 and when the facility was shut down in 1979, the Old Montana Prison struggled with the same problems which had plagued the institution for the entirety of its history: overcrowding, underfunding, and substandard conditions. The 1959 riot had raised awareness, but few Montanans recognized the problems or realized the extent of them. =1975 Theater fire= On 3 December 1975, after the building was vacated after a showing of The ODESSA File, fire broke out in the WA Clark Theatre.Baumler, p. 70 The fire managed to burn for two and a half hours before a guard noticed smoke coming from the building, and by the time help arrived, it was too late. Warden Frank Conley's \\"proudest achievement\\" had been destroyed. The state fire marshal would later determine the fire had been caused by a \\"homemade incendiary device\\". The arsonist was never discovered, but the remaining cellblock was searched and the presence of contraband, including weapons, inspired Warden Crist to sentence a dozen inmates to the maximum security building, which had been closed for three years. =Retirement of the Facility= Almost ten years after Warden Floyd Powell resigned, Governor Forrest Anderson, who had been instrumental in the negotiations which led to the end of the pea riot in 1957, managed to get the state legislature to approve $3.8 million to be used in the construction of a new facility,Edgerton, p. 105 but the funds did not become available until 1973. In 1974, contractors broke ground on the new prison, situated about three miles (5 km) outside of Deer Lodge on which had once been Warden Conley's ranch.Baumler, p. 103 The construction continued for five years, and the last inmates were removed from the Old Montana Prison on 5 September 1979. The old facility had been added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, but, upon the removal of inmates from the facility, the state was at a loss as to what to do with it.

This area was known as the Cherokee Strip. It was one of a few Kansas forts attacked by Confederate forces during the American Civil War. At one point the Confederate government claimed authority over the Neutral Lands. Both Union and Confederate troops operated in the area, as did guerrilla forces and militias prevalent in the Kansas-Missouri border area.Woodbury F. Pride, The History of Fort Riley (n.p.: 1926), p. 46 Fort Baxter was established during the war by Gen. James G. Blunt in May 1863. It was later described by the writer William E. Connelley as \\"consist[ing] of some log cabins with a total frontage of about 100 feet, facing east toward Spring river. Back of the fort, and of the same width, was a large space enclosed by embankments of earth thrown up against logs and about 4 feet high.\\"William E. Connelley, Quantrill and the Border Wars, New York: Pageant Book Co., 1956), 1956 ed., p. 422. The west wall of the embankment was torn out on October 5, 1863, to extend the north and south walls some 200 yards farther west. While still unfinished, the fort was attacked by Quantrill's raiders the next day, while about 60 men were out foraging on the prairie.Edited, Frank W.

Quantrill moved his men against the Union force led by Blunt out on the prairie, who was transferring a detachment from Fort Scott east to Fort Smith, Arkansas. Quantrill's guerrillas outnumbered the Union forces and killed most of them, a total of 103 men. Blunt and a few cavalry survived and escaped back to Fort Baxter.Connelley, pp. 430,, 432-4. After the massacre of Blunt's force, Quantrill withdrew and continued to Texas. The troops stationed at Fort Blair and the survivors of Blunt's force moved away from Fort Baxter and into Camp Ben Butler. They buried most of the dead from both sides in mass graves. When word of Blunt's defeat reached Fort Scott, Kansas, five companies of US troops were sent to temporarily reinforce Baxter Springs. But on October 20, 1863, the troops in Baxter Springs were ordered to abandon the area and return to the better fortified Fort Scott. They destroyed and burned everything they could not take with them, and the US Army abandoned Fort Baxter as a military post.Hugh L.

His mother died in his early childhood. He was brought up by, and received a Spartan home-education from, his well educated but very strict father, a retired army officer of Saxonian descent, who died when Schulzer was fifteen. Schulzer spent the following three years in a military academy-like company of cadets in Olomouc (Olm√ºtz). After enlisting he spent seven years as Cadet (officer in training) and the following six as F√§hnrich (officer candidate). Having finally attained the rank of a second lieutenant he became a captain within the following ten years. In 1821 he participated in the Piedmont campaign. In fighting a fire he lost the use of both hands and was retired from active duty two years later. He however volunteered to establish and manage a military hospital where he fell victim to a disease which left him deaf and vision impaired. He was married and had two daughters.http://www.kislexikon.hu/schulzer.html A chance encounter with a popular mushroom manual in 1831 awakened his intellectual curiosity. He taught himself natural history and sufficient Greek and Latin. Within a relatively short time he evolved from a gifted amateur mycologist to one appreciated by his more academic peers. In the interim he regained most of the use of his hands and some hearing. He published extensively in the mycological literature of his time. Much of his work remains unpublished, but some was edited and published by his colleagues and at times scientific rivals K√°roly Kalchbrenner and Friedrich von Hazslin.

It served as a stronghold of the Chandela Kings in Balwant Nagar from the 11th through the 17th century. How to reach The Jhansi fort is located in the middle of the Jhansi city. It is 3 km from the Jhansi Railway station. The nearest airport is Gwalior, which is 103 km from Jhansi.https://www.ixigo.com/jhansi-fort-jhansi-india-opening- visiting-timing-hours-closed-days-ne-1048121 You can also reach the fort by getting down at the Jhansi Museum Bus Stop.https://www.neotravellers.com/jhansi-fort-worth-a-visit/ History The construction of the Jhansi fort is ascribed to the Bundela Rajput chief and the ruler of the kingdom of Orchha Veer Singh ju Deo Bundela in 1613. It is one of the strongholds of the Bundelas. In 1728, Mohammed Khan Bangash attacked Maharaja Chattrasal. Peshwa Bajirao Baji Rao I helped Maharaja Chattrasal defeat the Mughal army. As a mark of gratitude, Maharaja Chattrasal offered a part of his state, which included Jhansi, to Peshwa Bajirao. In 1742 Naroshanker was made the subedar of Jhansi. During his tenure of 15 years he not only extended the strategically important Jhansi fort (the extension is called Shankergarh), but also constructed other buildings. In 1757, after Naroshanker was called back by the Peshwa. Madhav Govind Kakirde and then Babulal Kanahai were made the subedars of Jhansi. From 1766 to 1769 Vishwas Rao Laxman served as the subedar of Jhansi. Then Raghunath Rao (II) Newalkar was appointed the subedar of Jhansi. He was a very able administrator, increasing the revenue of the state and building both the MahaLakshmi Temple and the Raghunath Temple. After the death of Shiv Rao his grandson Ramchandra Rao was made subedar of Jhansi. His poorly administered term ended with his death in 1835. His successor Raghunath Rao (III) died in 1838. The British rulers then accepted Gangadhar Rao as the Raja of Jhansi. The inefficient administration of Raghunath Rao (III) left Jhansi in a very poor financial position. Jhansi Fort, c. 1882 Jhansi Fort night view However, he was succeeded by Raja Gangadhar Rao, who was a very good administrator. He was reportedly very generous and sympathetic, and the local population of Jhansi was well satisfied. In 1842 Raja Gangadhar Rao married Manikarnika Tambe who was the given the new name of Lakshmi Bai. She gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, in 1851, who died after four months. The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime. After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was adopted, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. In March 1854, Lakshmibai was given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort. In June 1857 the revolt broke out and she took the control of the fort and led Jhansi forces against those of the British East India Company. Jhansi was besieged by the company forces of General Hugh Rose in March and April 1858 and was captured on 4 April 1858. Rani Lakshmi Bai fought bravely and then made a daring escape on horseback from the fort before the city was pillaged by Rose's troops.Vishnubhat Godse has recorded what he knew of this in his Maza Praavas. In 1861 the British Government gave the Jhansi fort and Jhansi city to Jiyaji Rao Scindia, the Maharaja of Gwalior, but the British took back Jhansi from Gwalior state in 1868. Structure Kadak Bijli, 2007 The place from where Rani Lakshmibai jumped with her horse, Badal (according to legend) The fort standing in the hilly area shows how the North Indian style of fort construction differs from that of the South. In the South most of the forts were built on the sea beds like the Bekal Fort in Kerala. The granite walls of the fort are between 16 and 20 feet thick and on the south side the city walls meet. The south face of the fort is almost perpendicular.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books; p. 119 There are 10 gates giving access to the fort. These are Khanderao Gate, Datia Gate, Bhanderi Gate(Rani laxmi bai escape from this gate in 1957 battle), Unnao Gate, BadaGaon Gate, Laxmi Gate, Sagar Gate, Orchha Gate, Saiyar Gate and Chand Gate. Notable sights in the fort are the Shiva temple, Ganesh temple at the entrance, and the Kadak Bijli cannon used in the uprising of 1857. The memorial board reminds one of the hair-raising feat of the Rani Lakshmibai in jumping on horseback from the fort. Nearby is the Rani Mahal, built in the later half of the 19th century where there is now an archaeological museum. The fort extends to a sprawling and this colossal structure measures about 312m in length and 225m in width. On the whole, there are twenty-two supports with a mammoth strengthening wall surrounded by a moat on both sides. The shattered upholder on the eastern side was rebuilt by the British, who also added a floor to Panch Mahal.

In addition to being a renowned composer and conductor, Respighi was also a notable musicologist. His interest in Italian music of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries led him to compose works inspired by the music of these periods. Suite No. 1 (1917) Suite No. 1 P 109 was composed in 1917. It was based on Renaissance lute pieces by Simone Molinaro, Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo Galilei) and additional anonymous composers. # Balletto: \\"Il Conte Orlando\\" (Simone Molinaro, 1599) # Gagliarda (Vincenzo Galilei, 1550s) # Villanella (anonymous, end of 16th century) # Passo mezzo e mascherada (anonymous, end of 16th century) The orchestration calls for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in F, trumpet in D, harp, harpsichord and strings. Suite No. 2 (1923) Suite No. 2, P 138 was composed in 1923. It was based on pieces for lute, archlute, and viol by Fabritio Caroso, Jean- Baptiste Besard, Bernardo Gianoncelli, and an anonymous composer. It also includes an aria attributed to Marin Mersenne. # Laura soave: balletto con gagliarda, saltarello e canario (Fabritio Caroso) # Danza rustica (Jean- Baptiste Besard) # Campanae parisienses (anonymous) & Aria (attributed to Marin Mersenne) # Bergamasca (Bernardo Gianoncelli, 1650) The orchestration calls for an average-sized orchestra of 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in A/B‚ô≠, 2 bassoons, 3 horns in D (doubling 2 horns in E/F), 2 trumpets in A/D (doubling trumpet in C), 3 trombones, 3 timpani, celesta, harpsichord 4-hands, harp and strings. Suite No. 3 (1931) Suite No. 3, P 172 was composed in 1931. It differs from the previous two suites in that it is arranged for strings only and somewhat melancholy in overall mood. (A note by the composer in the printed score states that the work may also be performed by a string quartet, completely omitting the double-bass part.) It is based on lute songs by Besard, a piece for Baroque guitar by Ludovico Roncalli, and lute pieces by Santino Garsi da Parma and additional anonymous composers. # Italiana (Anonymous: Italiana (Fine sec.

It is tasked for territorial army duties, specifically for defense to the capital city region of Indonesia. History On 1 September 1945, the People's Security Bureau (Badan Keamanan Rakyat/BKR) was founded in Jakarta, and was led by Lt. Col. Mufraeni Mukmin. On 29 September 1945, allied forces (with Netherlands Indies Civil Administration personnel attached) under the command of Lt. Gen. Sir Philip Christison landed from in Tanjung Priok Harbor to disarm Japanese troops and to liberate prisoners of war. BKR and Indonesian youth in API, Kris Hisbulah, and other paramilitary organisations confronted the allied forces. To increase armed resistance against the allied forces, the government of the Republic of Indonesia founded the People's Security Forces (Tentara Keamanan Rakyat/TKR) on 5 October 1945. One regiment of TKR in Jakarta was organised under the command of Lt.Col. Mufraini Mukmin. On 24 September 1949, the Dutch government recognised Indonesia's Independence, one of the first actions of which was the signing of documents for the transfer of power in Jakarta Raya area from Comando Batavia En Ommelanden of the Dutch to Basis Comando Jakarta Raya of Indonesia, under supervision of Komisi Tiga Negara (KTN). This established 24 September as the anniversary day of Kodam Jaya. In December 1949, some units such as \\"Kala Hitam\\" Battalion and \\"Siluman\\" Battalion were dispatched to reinforce Basis Comando Jakarta Raya, following which Lt.Col. R. Taswin Natadiningrat was appointed as commander of Basis Comando Jakarta Raya. In January 1950, Basis Comando Jakarta Raya change its name to Komando Militer Pangkalan Jakarta Raya (KMP Jakarta Raya). Then, in accordance with instruction from Army HQ on 10 May 1950, Komando Militer Kota (KMK) was changed to Komando Militer Kota Besar Jakarta Raya ( KMKB-DR). As the Republic of Indonesia continued to developm, the Army Chief of Staff released two letters of command numbered SP 1671/10/1959 and SP 1672/10/1959 (both dated 24 December 1959), which reorganized the Army command for the capital, thus the 5th Regional Military Command/Jayakarta (Komando Daerah Militer V/Jayakarta, also known as the Jakarta Military Region, MRC 5/Jaya, Kodam V/Jaya or Region V/Jayakarta) was founded in the basis of the KMKB-DR which a new commander was to be named for this separate command for the region. After that, on 19 January 1960, at 9:00 am in Lapangan Banteng, the Chief of Staff of the Army, Lt. Gen. Abdul Haris Nasution, appointed Col.(inf) Umar Wirahadikusumah as the first Commander of Kodam V/Jaya. The 1st Mechanized Infantry Brigade took part in the events of the 30 September Movement, its commander being one of the coup attempt leaders. Col. Wirahadikusumah was spared from any action due to pressure from then Maj Gen Suharto, then commander of Kostrad, for him to prevent having to join the rebel forces in his area of operations. In 1984, the command simply became Kodam Jaya as part of an armed forces-wide reorganization, its numerical designation removed. Territorial units The Territorial Units in Kodam Jaya are two Military Area Command(Korem) units and a self-supporting Military District Command(Kodim). * Korem 051/Wijayakarta, consisting of five Military District Commands: ** Kodim 0504/South Jakarta ** Kodim 0505/East Jakarta ** Kodim 0507/Bekasi ** Kodim 0508/Depok ** Kodim 0509/Bekasi Regency * Korem 052/Wijayakrama, consisting of four Military District Commands: ** Kodim 0502/North Jakarta ** Kodim 0503/West Jakarta ** Kodim 0506/Tangerang ** Kodim 0510/Tigaraksa * Kodim 0501/Central Jakarta (self-supporting) Combat / Combat Support Units * 1st Capital Guards Infantry Brigade (Mechanized)/Jayasakti ** Brigade HQ ** 201st Mechanised Infantry Battalion/Jaya Yudha ** 202nd Mechanised Infantry Battalion/Tajimalela ** 203rd Mechanised Infantry Battalion/Arya Kemuning ** 9th Assault Armored Cavalry Squadron/Satya Dharma Kala(AMX-13 tanks) * 1st Air Defence Artillery Regiment/Falatehan ** Regiment HQ ** 6th Medium Air Defence Artillery Battalion ** 10th Medium Air Defence Artillery Battalion ** 3rd Missile Detachment * 7th Special Panzer Motorized Cavalry Squadron/Pragosa Satya (wheeled V-150 armoured cars) * 7th Field Artillery Battalion/Biring Galih * 3rd Combat Engineers Detachment/Agni Tirta Dharma Training units Training units in Kodam Jaya are organised under Kodam Jaya Training Regiment (Resimen Induk Kodam Jaya(Rindam Jaya)).

It is native to the Amazon River system and feeds on sponges. Unlike other members of the genus Sternarchogiton, there is pronounced sexual dimorphism in S. nattereri, with reproductively mature males developing strong external teeth on tips of their jaws. These males are so different from the females and juveniles that they were thought to be a different genus and species, the \\"tooth-lip knifefish\\" Oedemognathus exodon, for over 40 years. Distribution and habitat S. nattereri is restricted to large river channels in the lowlands of the Amazon basin. Its habitat ranges from high-conductivity, sediment-rich whitewater rivers such as the Rio Solim√µes, to low-conductivity, sediment-poor blackwaters such as the Rio Negro. It is one of the most common gymnotiforms in Rio Solim√µes. Description S. nattereri has a laterally compressed, knife-shaped body. The dorsal profile of the head is sharply curved from the nape to the snout. The mouth is terminal, with the upper jaw longer than the lower. The dentary is as long as deep, bearing a row of 7-8 conical teeth on the posterior portion, and there are upper and lower pharyngeal tooth plates bearing 9-11 and 7-9 teeth respectively. The eyes are small and covered by translucent skin. The long anal fin contains 180-198 rays. The pectoral fins are broad and pointed with 13-15 rays each, and the lanceolate caudal fin contains 11-15 rays and is almost completely covered with scales. There is a whip-like dorsal appendage anchored into a groove along the back by many fine threads of tendon. In reproductively mature males, the head becomes elongated and prominent external teeth develop on the upper and lower jaws. Males with teeth tend to have larger gonads than those without. The coloration is a uniform pale white with a pinkish hue caused by subdermal capillaries, especially over anal fin pterygiophores (fin support bones). The operculum is pink due to the presence of the gills underneath. The dorsal surface is gray, with tuberous electroreceptors visible as white dots. All the fins are hyaline, without dark chromatophores. The maximum known length is , with males tending to be larger than females. Biology and ecology The diet of S. nattereri consists of freshwater sponges growing on submerged trees, stumps, and other woody debris. Before they were recognized to be the males of S. nattereri, \\"Oedemognathus exodon\\" was speculated to use its dentition to feed on fish scales. The external teeth of male S. nattereri are now thought to be used in combat for territory or mates; scars and scratches have been found on the napes of several specimens. In the Tef√© region of Brazil, breeding occurs during the rising water period, with adults spawning in floating meadows along the edges of paran√° channels (side branches of whitewater rivers that run through adjacent v√°rzea floodplains). As water levels rise further and dissolved oxygen levels drop, the growing juveniles eventually disperse out of these floodplains within floating rafts of vegetation. Like other apteronotids, S. nattereri produces a continuous, weak electric field for the purposes of electrolocation and communication; this electric organ discharge (EOD) has a fundamental frequency between 732-1465 Hz, one of the largest ranges in the Apteronotidae. The waveform of this discharge has 2-4 phases and exhibits significant variation amongst individuals, but there is no obvious sexual dimorphism. S. nattereri is additionally able to modulate the frequency and amplitude of its EOD to produce communication signals called \\"chirps\\" (short- duration, high-frequency signals) and \\"gradual frequency rises\\" (long- duration, low-frequency signals). The frequency elevation of S. nattereri chirps ranges between 50 and 300 Hz above baseline, with a maximum of 500 Hz.

Biography In the early 1780s, Caleb emigrated with his brother, spending some time in York, Pennsylvania and then moved to Leesburg, Virginia in 1786. While in York, Bentley became a Quaker. In the early 1790s, Bentley established himself as a silversmith in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. Bentley was commissioned by President George Washington to make the brass cornerstone used for the White House groundbreaking ceremony in 1792. A year later, Bentley made a silver cornerstone which was used for the United States Capitol. Bentley relocated to Montgomery County, Maryland in 1794, settling in Brookeville, where his wife's (Sarah Brooke) family owned a large tract of land. In Brookeville, Bentley opened a store and a post office in 1802, becoming the First Postmaster of Brookeville. His first wife died in 1805, and two years later, he remarried to Henrietta Thomas. Bentley was also a founder of the Brookeville Academy, and along with two brothers-in-law, established the town of Triadelphia, on the Patuxent River. Bentley's wife, Henrietta Thomas, was a close friend of Dolley Madison. In August 1814, during the War of 1812, the White House was set ablaze by British troops during the Burning of Washington, in retaliation for burning Upper Canada's Parliament Buildings in the Battle of York. On August 26, 1814, President James Madison fled Washington, D.C., initially going to Virginia, but then turning north towards Rockville, where he expected to find General John Henry Winder and his troops. Winder's troops had already proceeded on towards Baltimore. Madison continued on eastward and arrived in Brookeville on horseback, where he found refuge in the home of Caleb Bentley. Madison stayed up all night dispatching orders, with Brookeville becoming the temporary capital of the USA. The Bentleys continued to live in Montgomery County for years, though he returned to live for a period of time in Georgetown in the late 1830s. Bentley died in 1851 in Sandy Spring, Maryland.

Politically right-wing, the group was highly active in the 1920s and 1930s, during which it worked against child labor legislation and the New Deal. Accusations of antisemitism and a decreasing relevance of its political agenda both served to weaken the organization, which ultimately disbanded in 1944. Origins and formation The Sentinels of the Republic was created as part of a surge in constitutionalism that occurred during the 1920s and 30s. During this period, historian Michael Kammen writes, constitutionalism \\"assumed a more central role in American culture than it ever had before,\\" and resulted in \\"the efflorescence of intensely partisan organizations that promoted patriotic constitutionalism as an antidote to two dreaded nemeses, governmental centralization and socialism.\\" In Massachusetts, on 22 September 1922 (in honor of the 200th anniversary of the birth of Samuel Adams), several of these organizations, including the National Association for Constitutional Government, the Public Interest League, the League for Preservation of American Independence, the Constitution Liberty League, the Anti- Centralization Club, the Sons of the Revolution, the American Legion, the Society of the Cincinnati, the American Rights League, and the American Defense Society joined forces under a cooperative arrangement called the Sentinels of the Republic. Louis A. Coolidge was chosen as the group's first president. The main purpose of the new organization was to serve as a defense against unconstitutional legislation. The Sentinels were particularly concerned with protecting the rights of the States, limiting government's interference with and regulation of business, and combating the threat of international communism. The founding principles of the Sentinels were: *\\"To maintain the fundamental principles of the American Constitution.\\" *\\"To oppose further Federal encroachment upon the reserved rights of the States.\\" *\\"To stop the growth of socialism.\\" *\\"To prevent the concentration of power in Washington through the multiplication of administrative bureaus under a perverted interpretation of the general welfare clause.\\" *\\"To help preserve a free republican form of Government in the United States.\\" The organization's motto was: Every citizen a Sentinel: every home a sentry box! Leaders and notable members The Sentinels' founding members were: *Louis Arthur Coolidge, Treasurer of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, former journalist and political publicist, served as private secretary to U.S. Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge, 1888‚Äì91 *James Jackson, Treasurer and Receiver-General of Massachusetts, former New England Chairman of the Red Cross *Herbert Parker, former Massachusetts Attorney General *Charles Sedgwick Rackemann, partner in the Boston law firm Rackemann, Sawyer & Brewster *Boyd B. Jones, a lawyer and former U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts *Henry F. Hurlbert, former District Attorney of Essex County, Massachusetts *Maurice S. Sherman, editor of the Hartford Courant, and later The Springfield Union *Frank F. Dresser, Massachusetts attorney *Katharine Torbert Balch, President of the Massachusetts Women's Anti-Suffrage Association Louis A. Coolidge, ca. 1922 Founding member and first president Herbert Parker, ca. 1905 Founding member Henry F. Hurlburt, ca. 1886 Founding member Coolidge served as the Sentinels' first president from 1922 until his death in 1925. He was succeeded by Bentley Wirt Warren, a Boston lawyer who had been the Democratic Party's candidate for Massachusetts' 11th Congressional District seat in 1894. Warren served from 1925 to 1927 and was succeeded by Alexander Lincoln, also a Boston lawyer, who served from 1927 to 1936. The Sentinels were heavily supported by some of the nation's wealthiest capitalists and industrialists. Raymond Pitcairn, billionaire son of PPG Industries founder, John Pitcairn, Jr., who served as the Sentinels' national chairman for several years, was also the group's primary benefactor: in early 1935 he single-handedly revitalized the Sentinels with a donation of $85,000 (more than $1.25 million in 2008 dollars ). To a group which had raised exactly $15,378.74 since 1931, this was a massive injection of capital. Other notable or prominent supporters of the Sentinels included Pitcairn's two brothers, Harold Frederick Pitcairn and Rev. Theodore Pitcairn; several powerful members of the du Pont Nemours chemical manufacturing dynasty (Pierre S. du Pont, President; Ir√©n√©e du Pont, Vice Chairman; Henry du Pont, Director of the Du Pont family's Wilmington Trust; and A. B. Echols, Vice President of du Pont Nemours and Director of the Wilmington Trust); Alfred P. Sloan, the long-time president and chairman of General Motors; Atwater Kent, the wealthy radio manufacturer; former Pennsylvania Senator George Wharton Pepper; Edward T. Stotesbury, a prominent investment banker and partner of J.P. Morgan & Co. and Drexel & Co.; Horatio Lloyd, also a partner of J.P. Morgan & Co.; J. Howard Pew, the President of Sun Oil; and Bernard Kroger, founder of the Kroger chain of supermarkets. The Sentinels' chief officers in 1933 included: *Alexander Lincoln, President *Frank L. Peckham, Vice-president *William H. Coolidge, Treasurer *John Balch, Secretary *Thomas F. Cadwalader, Chairman of the Executive Committee *H. G. Torbert, Executive Secretary *Raymond Pitcairn, National Chairman Activities and accomplishments The Sentinels' primary activities consisted of organized opposition to expansions of the federal government, which they saw as unconstitutional encroachment on the rights of the States and of the individual. Key targets included the creation of the Department of Education, the New Deal, and child labor legislation. In 1924-1925 the Sentinels garnered national attention when, under the leadership of Louis A. Coolidge, they successfully swayed Massachusetts opinion against the Child Labor Act. They persuaded key Massachusetts constituents to oppose the Child Labor Act by convincing them that it had Bolshevistic origins, and that it would lead to extreme consequences; e.g. denying a teenager of the right to help his widowed mother support his siblings, or even to assist with household and farm chores. The Sentinels also claimed that the proponents of the Child Labor Act wanted to remove children from the influence of their families and the authority of their parents. Following Coolidge's death in 1925, Bentley Wirt Warren became the Sentinels' second president. Under Warren, the Sentinels continued their efforts to oppose the Sheppard‚ÄìTowner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act of 1921 and the creation of a federal office of education. By 1927, in good part due to a flood of speakers, pamphlets, letters, and telegrams from the Sentinels, the latter was defeated. In 1926, in a fund-raising pamphlet entitled \\"To Arms! To Arms!\\", the organization boasted that it had \\"card-indexed more than 2000 radical propagandists making it comparatively easy to check their movements and counteract their activities.\\" Alexander Lincoln succeeded Warren as president, and it was during his term that the Sentinels achieved their greatest prominence. During the mid-1930s, anti-New-Deal sentiment in the business community led to a substantial increase the Sentinels' standing and financial support. The Sentinels held annual meetings during this period, at each of which they adopted a \\"program of policies\\" which were then disseminated in pamphlet form to stir public opinion. They also gave radio addresses, including two series of weekly addresses aired by the National Broadcasting Company, one in 1931 and the other in 1933‚Äì1934. They also held special meetings with \\"keynote\\" addresses. In 1934, under the coordination of national chairman Raymond Pitcairn, the Sentinels conducted a large-scale campaign against a proposed tax law that would have required publication of personal financial data, including an individual's gross income. They distributed hundreds of thousands of protest stickers and form letters urging people to demand that Congress repeal what they described as an \\"outrageous invasion of privacy.\\" The protest was successful: after receiving thousands of letters and telegrams opposing the legislation, Congress backed down. Accusations of antisemitism The Sentinels faced charges of antisemitism in the media and in history books. George Seldes, an influential muckracking journalist of the 1940s, described the Sentinels as \\"the anti-Semitic enemy of child labor laws\\" and \\"the anti-Semitic wing of the first really important American Fascist movement.\\" The historian Jules Archer writes that Sentinel members labeled Roosevelt's New Deal as \\"Jewish Communism\\". Substantiating these allegations, the Black Commission, a 1936 U.S. Senate investigation into lobbying, discovered instances of antisemitic language and attitudes within the Sentinels. Specifically, the commission uncovered a written correspondence between Sentinel member Cleveland Runyon and Alexander Lincoln, the organization's president, in which the latter wrote that the \\"Jewish threat\\" to the United States was a \\"real one\\" and added that \\"I am doing what I can as an officer of the Sentinels.\\" The former responded that the \\"old-line Americans of $1200 a year want a Hitler.\\" Following the resulting charges of antisemitism, Lincoln later denounced all forms of autocratic government, \\"whether they be communism, bolshevism, fascism, or Hitlerism.\\" The commander- in-chief of the Jewish War Veterans wrote to Lincoln that, following its own investigation, his organization had concluded that Lincoln did not \\"entertain any antipathy against the Jewish people or any racial minority.\\" However, these statements failed to erase the damage done to the reputation of the American Liberty League (the parent organization of the Sentinels) by the findings of the Black investigation. While the incident itself may have been a small part of the history of the Sentinels, it was the organization's largest source of press coverage. Dissolution By the 1940s, with their political objectives increasingly obsolete, the Sentinels had lost most of their support base, funds and influence. Finally, in 1944, they disbanded. The organization donated the remainder of its funds to Williams College for the purpose of endowing the Sentinels of the Republic Advanced Study Prize, a yearly award for the best student essay on the U.S. Constitution. The Sentinels also donated a collection of primary documents (brochures, newsletters, minutes) to the college's archives, where they currently reside, for the purpose of aiding students in preparing their essays.The decision to endow Williams was presumably influenced by the fact that at the time the decision was taken to disband, former Sentinels president and trustee Bentley W. Warren was serving on Williams' Board of Trustees.

In fact, according to Baca, that sentence was uttered by an Anglo white Baldwin Park politician in the 1950s; he was lamenting the influx of persons of Mexican ancestry into the San Gabriel Valley following World War II. The protests drew counter-protesters, and required city expenditure on crowd control and riot police, an admitted goal of Save Our State.

It replaced the previous Bongo-based van, sold as the \\"Besta\\" in most markets. At one point, it slotted between the Kia Carens and the larger, front-wheel drive Kia Carnival/Sedona. The long-wheelbase version was known as the Kia Pregio Grand. The Kia Pregio Grand is a best selling van in Latin American countries such as Colombia and Ecuador because of its high passenger capacity in its segment (16-19 passengers). Overview The original Besta had been receiving a lot of complaints due to engine problems, so when a new minivan was developed utilizing the more modern technology of the updated Bongo J2, it was decided to give it a new name. Thus, the Pregio appeared in 1995, with the diesel engine of the Bongo J2. The original Pregio received updates in 1998, 2000, and 2002. From 1997 a 3.0 OHV diesel engine with was also available and in 2001 a 4-speed automatic transmission was added. For export markets, right- hand drive Pregios were built only in panel van form. The front suspension is independent with coil springs and double wishbones, while at the rear a live axle with elliptic leaf springs is found, to save space and to handle heavy loads. Disc brakes up front and drums at the rear were standard in Europe at least. Late in its life, a intercooled turbodiesel engine of Mitsubishi origins (called TCi) was made available in European market Pregios. This unit could pass Euro III emissions standards for commercial vehicles and the van version could reach a top speed of . While earlier Kias had been using Mazda engineering, Hyundai's 1998 takeover meant that Mitsubishi parts found their way into Kia's vehicles. By late 2003 the Pregio underwent a thorough facelift. In some markets, such as Brazil, the original Besta had developed a very good reputation and had redefined a minivan market where its only competition was the antediluvian (in production since 1950) Volkswagen Kombi. Thus the new Pregio was marketed as the \\"Kia Besta GS\\" in Brazil from August 1997. There was no need to change the name, even though Besta means \\"beast\\" in most Latin tongues, readily lending itself to jokes. The Besta not only dominated the minivan market; it was Brazil's highest selling import vehicle of all types from 1997 until 2001. =Facelift model= Kia Pregio (CT2, Malaysia) A different looking Pregio debuted in late 2003, largely a facelift of the first model which could pass stricter European safety demands. It continued until its demise in 2006, due to dropping demand. The Pregio/Pregio Grand was dropped after the 2006 model year to make room for the more passenger-oriented, similarly-sized, short-wheelbase, front-wheel drive Kia Carnival/Sedona (originally the Carnival/Sedona was sold only in long- wheelbase). In South Korea, it was locally manufactured as the Kia Bongo III Coach. In Indonesia, a locally manufactured coach van version of the Bongo III Coach replaced the Pregio; it was marketed as the Kia Travello.

History Chuzhali village is named after the goddess Chuzhali, as this village is the abode of Chuzhali (Durga). The main place of worship in the village is the Chuzhali Bhagavathy temple. The village was under the dynasty of \\"Chuzhali Nambiars\\". In ancient times it was under \\"Chuzhali Swaroopam\\" and the boundary was \\"Koorgu\\" in Karnataka. In Malabar manual, William Logan mentioned Chuzhali as an ideal place for guerilla war, since the main land of Chuzhali is surrounded by high altitude areas, namely Kulathur, Thalakkulam, Edakkulm and Kuunam. Chuzhali Nambiar was one of the commanders of Pazhashiraja's guerilla army. It is said that Pazhashiraja had visited Chuzhali during his struggle against the British army. Chuzhali Nambiar was caught by the British army and was hanged at Thalassery. Ancient families The main Nambiar families in this place are Edayath, Padappayil, Palakkal, Manheri and Arayakkil. Prominent Namboodiri families include Puthussery, Palika and Mangalam. There were sixteen Namboodiri families in Chuzhali Desam. All but three are extinct due to the practices of sambandham, where only the eldest member in the family marries a Namboodiri girl, and the younger brothers marry non-Namboodiris. Politics Chuzhali is a main voting supporter of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

New Rice Varieties  Ezhome Rice varieties ‚ÄòEzhome-1‚Äô and ‚ÄòEzhome-2‚Äô are the first high yielding, non- lodging red rice varieties. They are designed for the saline-prone Kaipad rice fields of Kerala. They yield awn-less, non-shattering grains, and favourable cooking qualities, better than local cultivars. The average yields of ‚ÄòEzhome-1‚Äô and ‚ÄòEzhome-2‚Äô are 3.5 tones/ha and 3.2 tones/ha respectively under close-planted and no-management conditions of Kaipad. This yield is 70% and 60% more than that of local cultivars. These varieties differ in duration, have distinct morphological and qualitative traits, and have different salinity tolerance mechanisms, imparting varietal diversity to the unique ecosystem of Kaipad. These new seed varieties have been developed by the Kerala Agricultural University with the participation of farmers of Ezhome panchayat. This is the first venture of Kerala Agricultural University in development of a variety i) adopting the combined strategy of Global Breeding (traditional), and Participatory Plant Breeding, and ii) carrying out all stages of variety development directly in the problem area of farmers.

History Name of this place of emanated from the name of a Vedic Sage Kapila, who conducted Dakshayaga for Daksha. Daksha is a Sanskrit word said to be a Prajapati or one of the Brahma's sons. The equivalent meaning in English is Competent. One of the daughter of Prajapati (often said to be the youngest) was Sati or Dakshayani, who had always wished to marry Shiva. Daksha forbade it, but she disobeyed him and did so anyway, finding in Shiva a doting and loving husband. Daksha disliked Shiva intensely, calling him a dirty, roaming ascetic and reviling the great yogi's cohort of goblins and ghouls. From then on, he distanced himself from his daughter, Dakshayani/Sati, and his son-in- law, Shiva. This enmity culminated in a great sacrifice he had been hosting, one to which he invited all and sundry, family and allies, gods and rishis, courtiers and subjects. Consciously excluding Sati from the list, he also set up a statue of Shiva, which he defiled and mocked, at the entrance to his hall. Sati, ebullient at the thought of such a great event, and assuming that the daughter of the king was welcome no matter what, attended the festival. Snubbed by her father and treated with disdain, Sati nonetheless maintained her composure. Indeed, even her father's refusal to invite Shiva, her husband and thus a traditionally honored member of any Hindu family, was to some extent borne. Shiva carrying the corpse of his consort ‡§¶‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ø‡§®‡§ø (‡§∏‡§§‡•Ä) Dakshayani (Sati). However, on seeing the shameless insult to her husband in his absence, and the repeated slights King Daksha and his courtiers railed at Shiva, she committed suicide in grief for her beloved. Hearing the news, Shiva's attendants rushed inside the ceremony hall and started attacking all the guests present there, however, the demons invoked by Bhrigu defeated Shivas attendants and they retreated back to his abode. Upon hearing the news of his beloved wife's death, Shiva was furious that Daksha could so callously cause the harm of his (Daksha's) own daughter in so ignoble a manner. Shiva grabbed a lock of his matted hair and dashed it to the ground. From the two pieces rose the ferocious Virabhadra and the terrible Rudrakali, while Bhadrakali arose from the wrath of Devi herself. Upon Shiva's orders they stormed the ceremony and killed Daksha as well as many of the guests. Terrified and with remorse the others propitiated Lord Shiva and begged his mercy to restore Daksha's life and to allow the sacrifice to be completed. Shiva, the all-merciful One, restored Daksha's life, with the head of a goat. In his humility, and repentance for his graceless and sinful acts, Daksha became one of Shiva's most devoted, attendants. According to belief this happened in this place now Known as Kankol. As this disgraceful event happened in this place, the second part of Daksha Yagna is happened in the place named Kottiyur, in Kannur District. The place is blessed with the presence of Lord Shiva with Shiva temple. From the belief, there is a place named \\"yagabhumi\\"(where the Yagna took place), in Kankol Village. Formerly name of the place was Kapilan Kovval and which is shortened as Kankol.

History The Peringome Struggle has been held up as a singular instance of success in India in scrapping a proposed nuclear plant. This was possible by the pressure mounted by the campaign based on the socio-political and educational status as well as the demographic and geographical peculiarities of the state. The environmental consciousness promoted and spread by the ‚Äòsilent valley‚Äô movement and the general apprehension about radiation health hazards generated by discussions about the Chernobyl disaster fresh in the minds of the people, helped the resistance to gain such momentum. Now that about two decades have elapsed, I think, it is proper to make a few possible generalisations, especially when we are exploring chances of better networking and cooperation among anti-nuclear groups all over India.

In Australia, thousands joined protest marches in Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney. Scientists issued statements demanding an end to the tests; unions refused to load French ships, service French planes, or carry French mail; and consumers boycotted French products. In Fiji, activists formed an Against Testing on Mururoa organization. In November and December 1976, 7,000 people marched through the streets of Australian cities, protesting against uranium mining. The Uranium Moratorium group was formed and it called for a five-year moratorium on uranium mining. In April 1977 the first national demonstration co-ordinated by the Uranium Moratorium brought around 15,000 demonstrators into the streets of Melbourne, 5,000 in Sydney, and smaller numbers elsewhere.Falk, Jim (1982). Global Fission:The Battle Over Nuclear Power, pp. 264‚Äì5. A National signature campaign attracted over 250,000 signatures calling for a five-year moratorium.

Atomic Australia 1944‚Äì1990, New South Wales University Press, p. 156. On Palm Sunday 1982, an estimated 100,000 Australians participated in anti-nuclear rallies in the nation's largest cities. Growing year by year, the rallies drew 350,000 participants in 1985. The movement focused on halting Australia's uranium mining and exports, abolishing nuclear weapons, removing foreign military bases from Australia's soil, and creating a nuclear-free Pacific. On Dec 17th 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists occupied the Lucas Heights facility to protest the construction of a second research reactor. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of radioactive waste from the facility. In March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to mark one year since the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to uranium mining in Australia. There were also events in Sydney, and in Melbourne the protest included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are worried about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. Czech Republic As early as 1993 there were local and international protests against the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant's construction. Large grassroots civil disobedience actions took place in 1996 and 1997. These were organized by the so-called Clean Energy Brigades. In September and October 2000, Austrian anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated against the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant and at one stage temporarily blocked all 26 border crossings between Austria and the Czech Republic.

Protesters' demands were focused on getting France to shut its oldest nuclear power station at Fessenheim, which lies in a densely populated part of France, less than two kilometres from Germany and around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Switzerland. Around 2,000 people also protested at the Cattenom nuclear plant, France's second most powerful, in the Mosel region to the northwest of Strasbourg. Protesters in southwestern France staged another demonstration in the form of a mass picnic in front of the Blayais nuclear reactor, also in memory of Chernobyl. In France's northwestern region of Brittany, around 800 people staged a good-humoured march in front of the Brennilis experimental heavy-water atomic plant that was built in the 1960s. It was taken offline in 1985 but its dismantling is still not completed after 25 years. Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear campaigners protested in Paris. On June 26, 2011, around 5,000 protesters gathered near Fessenheim nuclear power plant, demanding the plant be shut down immediately. Demonstrators from France and Germany came to Fessenheim and formed a human chain along the road. Protesters claim that the plant is vulnerable to flooding and earthquakes. Fessenheim has become a flashpoint in renewed debate over nuclear safety in France after the Fukushima accident. The plant is operated by French power group EDF. In November 2011, thousands of anti- nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks. Thousands of people in Germany also interrupted the train's journey, forcing it to proceed at a snail's pace, covering 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) in 109 hours. More than 200 people were reported injured in the protests and several arrests were made. On December 5, 2011, nine Greenpeace activists cut through a fence at the Nogent Nuclear Power Plant. They scaled the roof of the domed reactor building and unfurled a \\"Safe Nuclear Doesn't Exist\\" banner before attracting the attention of security guards. Two activists remained at large for four hours. On the same day, two more campaigners breached the perimeter of the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant, escaping detection for more than 14 hours, while posting videos of their sit-in on the internet. In Aquitaine, the local group TchernoBlaye continue to protest against the continued operation of the Blayais Nuclear Power Plant. On the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, organisers of French anti-nuclear demonstrations claim 60,000 supporters formed a human chain 230 kilometres long, stretching from Lyon to Avignon. In March 2014, police arrested 57 Greenpeace protesters who used a truck to break through security barriers and enter the Fessenheim nuclear power plant in eastern France. The activists hung antinuclear banners, but France's nuclear safety authority said that the plant's security had not been compromised. President Hollande has promised to close Fessenheim by 2016, but Greenpeace wants immediate closure.

In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue. In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant. The Wyhl experience encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear sites. Many other anti-nuclear groups formed elsewhere, in support of these local struggles, and some existing citizen action groups widened their aims to include the nuclear issue. In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 200,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in Hannover and Bonn. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the construction of the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant on the North Sea coast west of Hamburg. Some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. Twenty-one policemen were injured by demonstrators armed with gasoline bombs, sticks, stones and high-powered slingshots.West Germans Clash at Site of A-Plant The New York Times, March 1, 1981, p. 17.Violence Mars West German Protest The New York Times, March 1, 1981, p. 17 The largest anti- nuclear protest was most likely a 1983 nuclear weapons protest in West Berlin which had about 600,000 participants.Blogs for Bush: The White House Of The Blogosphere: Edwards Calls Israel a Threat In October 1983, nearly 3 million people across western Europe protested nuclear missile deployments and demanded an end to the nuclear arms race. The largest turnout of protesters occurred in West Germany when, on a single day, 400,000 people marched in Bonn, 400,000 in Hamburg, 250,000 in Stuttgart, and 100,000 in West Berlin. In May 1986, following the Chernobyl disaster, clashes between anti-nuclear protesters and West German police became common. More than 400 people were injured in mid-May at the site of a nuclear-waste reprocessing plant being built near Wackersdorf. Police \\"used water cannons and dropped tear-gas grenades from helicopters to subdue protesters armed with slingshots, crowbars and Molotov cocktails\\". During a weekend in October 2008, some 15,000 people disrupted the transport of radioactive nuclear waste from France to a dump in Germany. This was one of the largest such protests in many years and, according to Der Spiegel, it signals a revival of the anti-nuclear movement in Germany.The Renaissance of the Anti-Nuclear Movement Spiegel Online, 11/10/2008.Anti-Nuclear Protest Reawakens: Nuclear Waste Reaches German Storage Site Amid Fierce Protests Spiegel Online, 11/11/2008.Simon Sturdee.

German nuclear programme threatened by old mine housing waste The Times, January 22, 2010. Following the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. On 12 March 2011, 60,000 Germans formed a 45-km human chain from Stuttgart to the Neckarwestheim power plant. On 14 March, 110,000 people protested in 450 other German towns, with opinion polls indicating 80% of Germans opposed the government's extension of nuclear power. On March 15, 2011, Angela Merkel said that seven nuclear power plants which went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time would be used to study speedier renewable energy commercialization. In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen. Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011. About 7,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in Bremen. About 3,000 people protested outside of RWE's headquarters in Essen. Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011. About 7,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in Bremen. About 3,000 people protested outside of RWE's headquarters in Essen. Other smaller rallies were held elsewhere. Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition announced on May 30, 2011, that Germany's 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's Fukushima I nuclear accidents. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so. In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks. India Following the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, many are questioning the mass roll-out of new plants in India, including the World Bank, the former Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, and the former head of the country's nuclear regulatory body, A. Gopalakrishnan. The massive Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project is the focus of concern ‚Äî \\"931 hectares of farmland will be needed to build the reactors, land that is now home to 10,000 people, their mango orchards, cashew trees and rice fields\\" ‚Äî and it has attracted many protests. Fishermen in the region say their livelihoods will be wiped out. Environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting for months over the planned six-reactor nuclear power complex on the plains of Jaitapur, 420 km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated in the wake of Japan's Fukushima I nuclear accidents. During two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local man was killed and dozens were injured. As of October 2011, thousands of protesters and villagers living around the Russian-built Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant in the southern Tamil Nadu province, are blocking highways and staging hunger strikes, preventing further construction work, and demanding its closure as they fear of the disasters like the Environmental impact of nuclear power, Radioactive waste, nuclear accident similar to the releases of radioactivity in March at Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been filed against the government's civil nuclear program at the apex Supreme Court. The PIL specifically asks for the \\"staying of all proposed nuclear power plants till satisfactory safety measures and cost-benefit analyses are completed by independent agencies\\". The People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy is an anti-nuclear power group in Tamil Nadu, India. The aim of the group is to close the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant site and to preserve the largely untouched coastal landscape, as well as educate locals about nuclear power. In March 2012, police said they had arrested nearly 200 anti-nuclear activists who were protesting the restart of work at the long-stalled nuclear power plant. Engineers have resumed working on one of two 1,000-megawatt Koodankulam nuclear reactors a day after the local government gave the green light for the resumption of the Russia-backed project. Italy In May 1986, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program, and 50,000 marched in Milan.

Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas, Cambridge University Press, p. 139. In mid-April, 17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power. In 1982, Chugoku Electric Power Company proposed building a nuclear power plant near Iwaishima, but many residents opposed the idea, and the island's fishing cooperative voted overwhelmingly against the plans. In January 1983, almost 400 islanders staged a protest march, which was the first of more than 1,000 protests the islanders carried out. Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011 there has been wider opposition to construction plans for the plant. Research results show that some 95 post-war attempts to site and build nuclear power plants resulted in only 54 completions. Many affected communities \\"fought back in highly publicized battles\\". Co-ordinated opposition groups, such as the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center and the anti-nuclear newspaper Hangenpatsu Shinbun have operated since the early 1980s. Cancelled plant orders included: *The Maki NPP at Maki, Niigata (Kambara)‚ÄîCanceled in 2003 *The Kushima NPP at Kushima, Miyazaki‚Äî1997 *The Ashihama NPP at Ashihama, Mie Prefecture‚Äî2000 (the first Project at the site in the 1970s where realized at Hamaoka as Unit 1&2) *The H≈çhoku NPP at H≈çhoku, Yamaguchi‚Äî1994 *The Suzu NPP at Suzu, Ishikawa‚Äî2003 In May 2006, an international awareness campaign about the dangers of the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant, Stop Rokkasho, was launched by musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. Greenpeace has opposed the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant under a campaign called \\"Wings of Peace ‚Äì No more Hiroshima Nagasaki\\",Wings of Peace ‚Äì No more Hiroshima Nagasaki since 2002 and has launched a cyberaction to stop the project. Consumers Union of Japan together with 596 organisations and groups participated in a parade on 27 January 2008 in central Tokyo against the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant. Over 810,000 signatures were collected and handed in to the government on 28 January 2008. Representatives of the protesters, which include fishery associations, consumer cooperatives and surfer groups, handed the petition to the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Seven consumer organisations have joined in this effort: Consumers Union of Japan, Seikatsu Club Consumer's Co-operative Union, Daichi-o-Mamoru Kai, Green Consumer's Co-operative Union, Consumer's Co- operative Union \\"Kirari\\", Consumer's Co-operative Miyagi and Pal-system Co- operative Union. In June 2008, several scientists stated that the Rokkasho plant is sited directly above an active geological fault line that could produce a magnitude 8 earthquake. But Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited have stated that there was no reason to fear an earthquake of more than magnitude 6.5 at the site, and that the plant could withstand a 6.9 quake.Japanese nuclear plant in quake risk Nature.com, 2008 Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters marched in Japan. Company workers, students, and parents with children rallied across Japan, \\"venting their anger at the government's handling of the crisis, carrying flags bearing the words 'No Nukes!' and 'No More Fukushima'.\\" Problems in stabilizing the Fukushima I plant have hardened attitudes to nuclear power. As of June 2011, \\"more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they are anti-nuclear and distrust government information on radiation\\". The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as \\"citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks\\". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission ‚Äì now required by law ‚Äì to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online. More than 60,000 people in Japan marched in demonstrations in Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Fukushima on June 11, 2011. In July 2011, Japanese mothers, many new to political activism, have started \\"taking to the streets to urge the government to protect their children from radiation leaking from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant\\". Using social networking media, such as Facebook and Twitter, they have \\"organized antinuclear energy rallies nationwide attended by thousands of protesters\\". In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, marching to the beat of drums, \\"took to the streets of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March earthquake and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant\\". An estimated 2,500 people marched past TEPCO headquarters, and created a human chain around the building of the Trade Ministry that oversees the power industry. Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy. Tens of thousands of people marched in central Tokyo in September 2011, chanting \\"Sayonara nuclear power\\" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Author Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1994, and has campaigned for pacifist and anti-nuclear causes addressed the crowd. Musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, who composed the score to the movie The Last Emperor was also among the event's supporters. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Yokohama on the weekend of January 14‚Äì15, 2012, to show their support for a nuclear power-free world. The demonstration showed that organized opposition to nuclear power has gained momentum in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The most immediate demand was for the protection of rights for those affected by the Fukushima accident, including basic human rights such as health care, living standards and safety. On the anniversary of the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami all over Japan protesters called for the abolishment of nuclear power, and the scrapping of nuclear reactors. * Tokyo: ** a demonstration was held in the streets of Tokyo and the march ended in front of the headquarters of TEPCO * Koriyama, Fukushima **16,000 people were at a meeting, they walked through the city calling for the end of nuclear power. * Shizuoka Prefecture ** 1,100 people called for the scrapping of the Hamaoka reactors of Chubu Electric Power Co.. * Tsuruga, Fukui ** 1,200 people marched in the streets of the city of Tsuruga, the home of the Monju fast- breeder reactor prototype and the nuclear reactors of Kansai Electric Power Co. ** The crowd objected the restart of the reactors of the Oi-nuclear power plant. Of which NISA did approve the so-called stress-tests, after the reactors were taken out of service for a regular check-up. * Saga city, Aomori city ** Likewise protests were held in the cities of Saga and Aomori and at various other places hosting nuclear facilities. * Nagasaki and Hiroshima ** Anti-nuclear protesters and atomic-bomb survivors marched together and demanded that Japan should end its dependency on nuclear power.The Mainichi Shimbun (12 March 2012) Antinuclear protests held across Japan on anniversary of disaster In June 2012, tens of thousands of protesters participated in anti-nuclear power rallies in Tokyo and Osaka, over the government's decision to restart the first idled reactors since the Fukushima disaster, at Oi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukui Prefecture. New Zealand From the early 1960s New Zealand peace groups CND and the Peace Media organised nationwide anti- nuclear campaigns in protest of atmospheric testing in French Polynesia. These included two large national petitions presented to the New Zealand government which led to a joint New Zealand and Australian Government action to take France to the International Court of Justice (1972). In 1972, Greenpeace and an amalgam of New Zealand peace groups managed to delay nuclear tests by several weeks by trespassing with a ship in the testing zone. During the time, the skipper, David McTaggart, was beaten and severely injured by members of the French military. On 1 July 1972, the Canadian ketch Vega, flying the Greenpeace III banner, collided with the French naval minesweeper La Paimpolaise while in international waters to protest French nuclear weapon tests in the South Pacific. In 1973 the New Zealand Peace Media organised an international flotilla of protest yachts including the Fri, Spirit of Peace, Boy Roel, Magic Island and the Tanmure to sail into the test exclusion zone. Also in 1973, New Zealand Prime Minister Norman Kirk as a symbolic act of protest sent two navy frigates, HMNZS Canterbury and HMNZS Otago, to Mururoa. They were accompanied by HMAS Supply, a fleet oiler of the Royal Australian Navy. In 1985 the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior was bombed and sunk by the French DGSE in Auckland, New Zealand, as it prepared for another protest of nuclear testing in French military zones. One crew member, Fernando Pereira of Portugal, photographer, drowned on the sinking ship while attempting to recover his photographic equipment. Two members of DGSE were captured and sentenced, but eventually repatriated to France in a controversial affair. Philippines In the Philippines, a focal point for protests in the late 1970s and 1980s was the proposed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, which was built but never operated. The project was criticised for being a potential threat to public health, especially since the plant was located in an earthquake zone. South Korea In March 2012, environmental conservation groups staged a rally in central Seoul to voice opposition to nuclear power on the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. According to organizers, over 5,000 people attended, and the turnout was one of the biggest in recent memory for an antinuclear demonstration. The rally adopted a declaration demanding that President Lee Myung Bak abandon his policy to promote nuclear power. Spain In Spain, in response to a surge in nuclear power plant proposals in the 1960s, a strong anti-nuclear movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately impeded the realisation of most of the projects.Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power, Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 371. On July 14, 1977, in Bilbao, Spain, between 150,000 and 200,000 people protested against the Lemoniz Nuclear Power Plant. This has been called the \\"biggest ever anti-nuclear demonstration\\".Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 138. Sweden In June 2010, Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists invaded Forsmark nuclear power plant to protest the then-plan to remove the government prohibition on building new nuclear power plants. In October 2012, 20 Greenpeace activists scaled the outer perimeter fence of the Ringhals nuclear plant, and there was also an incursion of 50 activists at the Forsmark plant. Greenpeace said that its non-violent actions were protests against the continuing operation of these reactors, which it says are unsafe in European stress tests, and to emphasise that stress tests did nothing to prepare against threats from outside the plant. A report by the Swedish nuclear regulator said that \\"the current overall level of protection against sabotage is insufficient\\". Although Swedish nuclear power plants have security guards, the police are responsible for emergency response. The report criticised the level of cooperation between nuclear site staff and police in the case of sabotage or attack. Switzerland In May 2011, some 20,000 people turned out for Switzerland's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration in 25 years. Demonstrators marched peacefully near the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant, the oldest in Switzerland, which started operating 40 years ago. Days after the anti-nuclear rally, Cabinet decided to ban the building of new nuclear power reactors. The country's five existing reactors would be allowed to continue operating, but \\"would not be replaced at the end of their life span\\". Taiwan Anti Taiwan's 4th nuclear power plant banner. Anti-nuclear movements in Taipei In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate end to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant. The protesters were also opposed to lifespan extensions for three existing nuclear plants. In May 2011, 5,000 people joined an anti-nuclear protest in Taipei City, which had a carnival- like atmosphere, with protesters holding yellow banners and waving sunflowers. This was part of a nationwide \\"No Nuke Action\\" protest, against construction of the fourth nuclear plant and in favor of a more renewable energy policy. On World Environment Day in June 2011, environmental groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 environmental groups and legislators, gathered in Taipei and protested against the nation's three operating nuclear power plants and the construction of the fourth plant. In March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital following the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan one year ago. The protesters rallied in Taipei to renew calls for a nuclear-free island by taking lessons from Japan's disaster on March 11, 2011. They \\"want the government to scrap a plan to operate a newly constructed nuclear power plant ‚Äì the fourth in densely populated Taiwan\\". Scores of aboriginal protesters \\"demanded the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on their Orchid Island, off south-eastern Taiwan. Authorities have failed to find a substitute storage site amid increased awareness of nuclear danger over the past decade\\". In March 2013, 68,000 Taiwanese protested across major cities against the island's fourth nuclear power plant, which is under construction. Taiwan's three existing nuclear plants are near the ocean, and prone to geological fractures, under the island. Active seismic faults run across the island, and some environmentalists argue Taiwan is unsuited for nuclear plants. Construction of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant using the ABWR design has encountered public opposition and a host of delays, and in April 2014 the government decided to halt construction. The Netherlands Protest in The Hague against the nuclear arms race between the U.S./NATO and the Warsaw Pact, 1983 In October 1983, nearly one million people assembled in the Hague to protest Pershing II ballistic missile deployments and demand an end to the nuclear arms race. United Kingdom Anti-nuclear weapons protest march in Oxford, 1980 In March 2006, a protest took place in Derby where campaigners handed a letter to Margaret Beckett, head of DEFRA, outside Derby City Council about the dangers of nuclear power stations. Anti-nuclear march from London to Geneva, 2008 Start of anti-nuclear march from Geneva to Brussels, 2009 The first Aldermaston March organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament took place at Easter 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment close to Aldermaston in Berkshire, England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, pp. 96‚Äì97. Many significant anti-nuclear mobilizations in the 1980s occurred at the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp. It began in September 1981 after a Welsh group called \\"Women for Life on Earth\\" arrived at Greenham to protest against the decision of the Government to allow cruise missiles to be based there. The women's peace camp attracted significant media attention and \\"prompted the creation of other peace camps at more than a dozen sites in Britain and elsewhere in Europe\\". In December 1982 some 30,000 women from various peace camps and other peace organisations held a major protest against nuclear weapons on Greenham Common. On 1 April 1983, about 70,000 people linked arms to form a human chain between three nuclear weapons centres in Berkshire. The anti-nuclear demonstration stretched for 14 miles along the Kennet Valley.Paul Brown, Shyama Perera and Martin Wainwright. Protest by CND stretches 14 miles The Guardian, 2 April 1983. In London, in October 1983, more than 300,000 people assembled in Hyde Park. This was \\"the largest protest against nuclear weapons in British history\\", according to The New York Times. In 2005 in Britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging Trident weapons system with a newer model. The largest protest had 100,000 participants and, according to polls, 59 percent of the public opposed the move. In October 2008 in the United Kingdom, more than 30 people were arrested during one of the largest anti-nuclear protests at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston for 10 years. The demonstration marked the start of the UN World Disarmament Week and involved about 400 people.More than 30 arrests at Aldermaston anti-nuclear protest The Guardian, 28 October 2008. In October 2011, more than 200 protesters blockaded the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station site. Members of several anti-nuclear groups that are part of the Stop New Nuclear alliance barred access to the site in protest at EDF Energy's plans to renew the site with two new reactors. In January 2012, three hundred anti-nuclear protestors took to the streets of Llangefnia, against plans to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa. The march was organised by a number of organisations, including Pobl Atal Wylfa B, Greenpeace and Cymdeithas yr Iaith, which are supporting farmer Richard Jones who is in dispute with Horizon. On March 10, 2012, the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, hundreds of anti-nuclear campaigners formed a symbolic chain around Hinkley Point to express their determined opposition to new nuclear power plants, and to call on the coalition government to abandon its plan for seven other new nuclear plants across the UK. The human chain continued for 24 hours, with the activists blocking the main Hinkley Point entrance. In April 2013, thousands of Scottish campaigners, MSPs, and union leaders, rallied against nuclear weapons. The Scrap Trident Coalition wants to see an end to nuclear weapons, and says saved monies should be used for health, education and welfare initiatives. There was also a blockade of the Faslane Naval Base, where Trident missiles are stored. United States Map of major U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure sites during the Cold War and into the present.

The White House Peace Vigil, June 2006 On November 1, 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. It was the largest national women's peace protest of the 20th century. On May 2, 1977, 1,414 Clamshell Alliance protesters were arrested at Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant.Michael Kenney. Tracking the protest movements that had roots in New England The Boston Globe, December 30, 2009.Williams, Eesha. Wikipedia distorts nuclear history Valley Post, May 1, 2008. The protesters who were arrested were charged with criminal trespass and asked to post bail ranging from $100 to $500. They refused and were then held in five national guard armories for 12 days. The Seabrook conflict, and role of New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson, received much national media coverage.William A. Gamson and Andre Modigliani. Media Coverage and Public Opinion on Nuclear Power , American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 95, No. 1, July 1989, p. 17. The American public were concerned about the release of radioactive gas from the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and many mass demonstrations took place across the country in the following months. The largest one was held in New York City in September 1979 and involved two hundred thousand people; speeches were given by Jane Fonda and Ralph Nader. On June 3, 1981, Thomas launched the longest running peace vigil in US history at Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.. He was later joined on the White House Peace Vigil by anti-nuclear activists Concepcion Picciotto and Ellen Benjamin. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti- nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history. Beginning in 1982, an annual series of Christian peace vigils called the \\"Lenten Desert Experience\\" were held over a period of several weeks at a time, at the entrance to the Nevada Test Site in the USA. This led to a faith-based aspect of the nuclear disarmament movement and the formation of the anti- nuclear Nevada Desert Experience group. The Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice was located in Seneca County, New York, adjacent to the Seneca Army Depot. It took place mainly during the summer of 1983. Thousands of women came to participate and rally against nuclear weapons and the \\"patriarchal society\\" that created and used those weapons. The purpose of the Encampment was to stop the scheduled deployment of Cruise and Pershing II missiles before their suspected shipment from the Seneca Army Depot to Europe that fall. The Encampment continued as an active political presence in the Finger Lakes area for at least 5 more years. Hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., in 1986 in what is referred to as the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. The march took nine months to traverse , advancing approximately fifteen miles per day.Hundreds of Marchers Hit Washington in Finale of Nationwide Peace March Gainesville Sun, November 16, 1986. Other notable anti-nuclear protests in the United States have included: * May 2, 1977: 1,414 protesters were arrested at Seabrook, an event which received much media coverage. * June 1978: some 12,000 people attended a protest at Seabrook. * August 1978: almost 500 Abalone Alliance protesters were arrested at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant. * April 8, 1979: 30,000 people marched in San Francisco to support shutting down the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.Amplifying Public Opinion: The Policy Impact of the U.S. Environmental Movement p. 7. * April 28, 1979: 15,000 people demonstrated against the Rocky Flats Nuclear Processing Plant in Colorado, making the link between nuclear power and nuclear weaponry. * May 1979: An estimated 65,000 people, including the Governor of California, attended a march and rally against nuclear power in Washington, D.C. * June 2, 1979: about 500 people were arrested for protesting about construction of the Black Fox Nuclear Power Plant in Oklahoma. * June 3, 1979: following the Three Mile Island accident, some 15,000 people attended a rally organized by the Shad Alliance and about 600 were arrested at Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant in New York.Shoreham Action Is One of Largest Held Worldwide; 15,000 Protest L.I.

Anti-nuclear protests preceded the shutdown of the Shoreham, Yankee Rowe, Millstone I, Rancho Seco, Maine Yankee, and about a dozen other nuclear power plants.Williams, Estha. Nuke Fight Nears Decisive Moment Valley Advocate, August 28, 2008. On May 1, 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched past the United Nations in New York, 60 years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the U.S. for several decades. In 2008 and 2009, there have been protests about, and criticism of, several new nuclear reactor proposals in the United States.Protest against nuclear reactor Chicago Tribune, October 16, 2008.Southeast Climate Convergence occupies nuclear facility Indymedia UK, August 8, 2008.

In May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched for about two kilometers from downtown New York to a square in front of United Nations headquarters, calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons. The march occurred ahead of the opening of the review conference on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty (NPT).A-bomb survivors join 25,000-strong anti-nuclear march through New York Mainichi Daily News, May 4, 2010. USSR The anti-nuclear organisation \\"Nevada Semipalatinsk\\" was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major anti-nuclear groups in the former Soviet Union. It attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk, in north-east Kazakhstan, in 1991. The Soviet Union conducted over 400 nuclear weapons tests at the Semipalatinsk Test Site between 1949 and 1989.

The band formed in 2004 and is based in Atlanta, Georgia. Overview The Last Waltz Ensemble is a musical group that progressively plays the music of Bob Dylan and The Band. The group bolsters a play list of over seventy Bob Dylan, The Band, and related songs, covering music from all eras of the artists‚Äô careers. From The Hawks to the Basement Tapes to The Last Waltz to later recordings, the group plays traditional and original arrangements in an improvisational jam band format. The group uses vintage equipment and borrowed arrangements, and incorporates guest performances by friends from regional and national acts. Origin In the fall of 2004, the Marietta, Georgia-based original Americana band Houndog decided to hold a one-time concert celebration, a tribute to the music from the Martin Scorsese movie The Last Waltz. Houndog, made up of Mark Kramer, lead vocals and acoustic guitar; Kris Gloer, vocals and lead guitar; Eric Reed, bass and vocals; and Shawn Stickney, drums, was a regular band on the Atlanta, Georgia, music scene. Houndog regularly played house gigs on Wednesday and Friday nights at Crystal's bar on the Marietta Square, as well as one night stands all over Atlanta's hotspots such as The Brandy House, Fuzzy's Place and Smith's Olde Bar. Led into the project by Kris Gloer, the group contacted Brian Cole, talent buyer for the club Fuzzy's Place, to arrange a venue for the show. In keeping with the spirit of the final concert of The Band, the group chose Thanksgiving weekend, in November 2004. With the dates and venue scheduled, the group decided to have some of their friends from the burgeoning Atlanta, Georgia, music scene perform special guest features, highlighting the guest musicians‚Äô abilities with songs suited for their styles and influences. Guests from that weekend included Tommy Talton, founding member of the band Cowboy and former lead guitarist for The Gregg Allman Band; the late blues musician Sean Costello; and Rev. Jeff Mosier of Blueground Undergrass. The show sold out, drawing more people than could fit in the more than thirty-year-old establishment. After the weekend was over, Houndog returned to a regular schedule of original music but decided to make the show an annual Thanksgiving weekend event. The following year the show relocated to its current home, Smith's Olde Bar in midtown Atlanta. The Thanksgiving 2005 show included guest performances by Kevin Harris, Terence Higgins and Efrem Towns from The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Rick Richards from The Georgia Satellites and Mimi Holland Thomas. In the spring of 2006 the group, by then called ‚ÄúThe Last Waltz Ensemble‚Äù, decided to do a test marketing of the show in five cities across the Southeastern United States. Following sold-out performances in Charleston, South Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama; and Athens, Georgia, the group was signed by Intrepid Artists International of Charlotte, North Carolina and began touring the United States performing over seventy shows a year. Since the group was signed it has played more than two hundred shows, performing in clubs and theaters, and performed as part of community concerts and festivals. The group continues to welcome guest performances during concerts. Former guest performers include Susan Tedeschi, Ted Pecchio, Oliver Wood, Colonel Bruce Hampton, Ret., Sean Costello, Rev. Jeff Mosier, Efrem ‚ÄúET‚Äù Towns, Kevin Harris, Mike ‚ÄúSwami‚Äù Schumann, Caroline Aiken, Ike Stubblefield, Bobby Houck, Brock Butler, Charlie Starr, Rick Richards, Zach Deputy, CR Gruver, and Justin Brogdon. The group released its first record, a CD recorded live in Charlotte, North Carolina, entitled Live at The Visulite Theater in January 2008. Tracks on the disc include ‚ÄúKing Harvest‚Äù, ‚ÄúTime To Kill‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down‚Äù, ‚ÄúLike a Rolling Stone‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt Makes No Difference‚Äù, and Dylan's ‚ÄúYou Ain‚Äôt Going Nowhere‚Äù. The group is currently working with Atlanta, Georgia, musician and producer Oliver Wood on an upcoming studio release.

The band was formed by Graham Earnshaw, on guitar and vocals, Chris, a Brazilian drummer, and Richard Thwaites, an Australian bass player who doubled as the China correspondent of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It played one of the first rock concerts in China at a university campus hall in Beijing in late summer of 1979. Their performance at Beijing's Teacher's College in 1981 was commemorated by a photograph in the book China After Mao by Liu Heung Shing. Members The lineup changed regularly over the years, but members included: * Guitarist and singer Graham Earnshaw, the band's founder, who went on to claim to be the first person ever to play the kazoo on the Great Wall of China. * Guitarist Michael Schoenhals, later to leverage his collection of Chairman Mao buttons into a position as Scandinavian expert on China's Cultural Revolution. * Palestinian lead guitarist Nassir, who took a sabbatical from the band in mid-1983 to drive tanks against Israel in southern Lebanon, and committed suicide in around 1991. * American guitarist Tad Stoner, who later became a journalist and bar owner in Hong Kong and is now a journalist in the Cayman Islands. * American bass player Fred Burke, who went on to become a prominent corporate lawyer in Vietnam. * American guitarist Larry Vest. * Swedish sax player Fr√©d√©ric Cho, who went on to become one of Scandinavia's top China financial experts and Asian Manager at HQ Bank.http://www.establishingabroad.com/Bazment/1012.aspx * Madagascan drummer Robinson, who went on to found his own band named Nogabe that is currently based in London.

Earnshaw, who owned the bands gear, eventually passed on the drums and amplifiers to a Madagascan band that was starting up in 1984, while his Fender Telecaster went on long-term loan to the Madagascan guitarist Eddie, who later became the lead guitarist with the so-called godfather of Chinese rock, Cui Jian.

They are known to be in pursuit of the Intersect and have also attempted to break into Castle, but neither Jill nor Leader identified Chuck as a person of interest beyond what he could tell them about the facility's computer systems and in actually gaining access to it. While they are shown having international contacts such as the Russian seductress Sasha Banachek, there has been no indication of whether their interests are restricted solely to the United States or if they have international objectives as well. It is known that MI6 is also involved with tracking Fulcrum's activities, as they planted agent Cole Barker in the organization.\\"Chuck Versus the Beefcake\\" In the episode \\"Chuck Versus the Suburbs\\", it is revealed that Fulcrum has developed their own Intersect, which they successfully upload into Chuck's brain. Previous episodes show the government attempted to use the original Intersect on government agents as a way to give them information that they could access instantaneously, but according to Fulcrum operatives Sylvia and Brad, the CIA has abandoned the project and Fulcrum wants to restart their own. Dialog between Chuck and several Fulcrum agents suggest that they may believe they're trying to protect the country, in a case of the ends justifying the means. Specifically, they expressed contempt for the CIA abandoning the Intersect and trying to \\"slug it out\\" in the War on Terror using Cold War tactics, and Fulcrum hoped that the Intersect would create more effective agents \\"ready to fight tomorrow's wars.\\" Later, in \\"Chuck Versus the First Kill\\", a Fulcrum recruiting session heavily promotes \\"strength\\" and \\"leadership\\" and includes the words, \\"We live a dangerous world, and you want to do something about it.\\" Fulcrum agents in \\"Chuck Versus the Lethal Weapon\\" stated that they consider themselves patriots. =One part of the Ring= Fulcrum is one of many smaller organizations making up the Ring. However, the exact nature of the connection between the groups has never been established. It seems that only higher Fulcrum agents may be aware that they are being run by The Ring, as in the series finale a Fulcrum agent possesses a piece of a device that The Ring possesses another part of, and furthermore he believes that Fulcrum is superior to The Ring as a terrorist network. Vincent, the Fulcrum agent assigned to track down Stephen Bartowski, is shown to have direct access to the Council, despite being subordinate to Ted Roark. It is also unclear if Fulcrum's own apparent goal‚Äîdefending the United States through any means necessary‚Äîis independent of the Ring's own objectives, or furthers the Ring's global agenda. Leadership Much like the CIA, Fulcrum appears to assign higher-ranking or more experienced handlers to their assets. Tommy Delgado attempted to recruit Bryce Larkin and commanded the operation attempting to recover the Intersect. Before his execution, Frank Mauser also implied that he was a person of unusual importance within the organization, though the meaning of this was not made clear in the episode. Few other details have been revealed about Fulcrum's command structure. =Tommy Delgado= Tommy (Anthony Ruivivar), born November 4, 1970 in Honolulu, Hawaii, is the operative who initially attempts to use Bryce Larkin to steal the Intersect, and was part of the failed operation to have him smuggled back into the country by the Demetrios ring. He later deduced that Bryce Larkin was a decoy and that Chuck was the real Intersect. He was later arrested and has not been seen in the show since, however he is still involved with tracking the Intersect from his cell. It was a \\"flash\\" on Tommy that first revealed Fulcrum's existence to Chuck. Until Jill was revealed to be a Fulcrum agent, Tommy was the only Fulcrum agent to have appeared in more than one episode, and a picture of Tommy is seen on Chuck's diagram detailing the connections between the Intersect and several Fulcrum members. He was played by Anthony Ruivivar as cool and ruthless, with no compunctions against killing innocent civilians in pursuit of his mission objectives. Tommy's birth date and birthplace are the same as the actor who plays him. Though he appears in only two episodes, Tommy is one of the most important characters in the show's mythology, as his actions set the plot in motion. He could also be seen as the main antagonist of the first season. =Leader= Leader (played by Patrick Kilpatrick) is the Fulcrum handler of Dr. Jill Roberts. Little is known about him, including his real name. Leader is a tough, hardened operative. It is currently unknown whether he had any knowledge of Bryce Larkin, the Intersect, or what Fulcrum intended to do with Castle once they took control, however his position overseeing the operation indicates he is ranked somewhere above an ordinary field operative. The incident is the first confirmed instance of two Fulcrum agents working directly in tandem on the same operation. Leader is a talented and in his own words, \\"devious\\", strategist and arranged his own capture to gain access to Castle by using Chuck's own feelings for Jill against him. =Frank Mauser= Lt. Mauser was born on January 14, 1958 in Joliet, IL. A long-time LAPD negotiator, it is believed that he developed extensive ties with Fulcrum during his time as commandant of the LA Police Academy. When the employees of the Buy More were taken hostage by Ned Rhyerson, Lt. Frank Mauser (Michael Rooker) took control as hostage negotiator. Mauser orchestrated the entire incident with Ned as his partner‚Äîfrom the high-speed police chase, to the car crashing into the Buy More and the hostage situation‚Äîall to identify who Casey and Sarah are assigned to protect. Mauser's exact position within Fulcrum is unknown, however his claims that Fulcrum would be determined to rescue him indicates he held a fairly high rank within the organization. He was highly intelligent and his plan nearly succeeded in both identifying and capturing the Intersect, making him the closest any of their agents have come to achieving their goal (only Tommy and Lizzie had positively identified Chuck before, though Colt may have been suspicious). He knew both Casey and Sarah were assigned to protect someone within the Buy More, and arranged for Ned to eliminate Casey as a threat by feigning to accidentally shoot him in the foot, enough to disable him but a minor enough wound to keep the following negotiations believable. The operation required a high level of planning only seen before by Leader's operation to access Castle. In addition to his tactical abilities, Mauser was highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, possibly even superior to Sarah. Though he surrendered, he was executed by Sarah due to the extreme threat he presented to Chuck. =Duncan= Duncan (Vincent Duvall), born on December 15, 1975 in Chicago, IL, is Dr. Busgang's Fulcrum handler and part of the team developing the Fulcrum Intersect. He was responsible for Cole's capture at the end of \\"Chuck Versus the Beefcake\\", and attempted to extract Chuck's identity from him by means of torture. Duncan says that the members of Fulcrum are \\"patriots\\" who \\"do what needs to be done to preserve this nation's rightful place in the world.\\" Duncan executed Busgang before being shot and killed by Sarah. According to NBC.com, Duncan was once a Marine Corps sniper who was honorably discharged after serving with distinction during Operation Desert Storm. He joined Fulcrum due to growing disillusionment after his discharge. =Vincent Smith= Vincent (Arnold Vosloo) was born on May 7, 1972 in Denver, CO. He is the head of the Fulcrum team in search of Orion, the Intersect designer, and has been tracking him for three years. He eventually managed to locate him in Hong Kong, narrowly missing a lethal trap set up by Orion. He kidnaps Chuck in hopes of luring Orion into the open to capture him but his plan is foiled by Sarah and Casey, who shoot him before he escapes.\\"Chuck Versus the Predator\\" In \\"Chuck Versus the Dream Job\\", Vincent was revealed to have survived his wound and escaped capture. He was working with Ted Roark in the efforts to capture Stephen Bartowski. Vincent returned again in \\"Chuck Versus the Colonel\\", and was tracking Chuck and Sarah for Roark after they went AWOL at the end of \\"Chuck Versus the First Kill\\". He briefly captured Sarah before Chuck ran him over with their car but survived his injuries. He captures the team when they assault Black Rock to rescue Stephen, and was apparently inside the drive-in when the F-16 air strike occurred, dying as a result.Chuck: Chris Fedak vs. the Finale: What's Alan Watching? Vincent was a former US Army Ranger (rank of Second Lieutenant) believed to be killed in action in Khowst, Afghanistan. In reality, his death was staged and he went underground working for Fulcrum. He is a native of Louisville, KY and originally enlisted into the U.S. Army Reserve in October 1985 as a combat engineer. He was commissioned from the University of Kentucky ROTC program as a distinguished military graduate in May 1989. He graduated in December 1990 with a bachelor of arts in geography. He entered active duty in February 1991 as a chemical officer. From June 1994 to June 1996, he successfully completed and graduated from the Special Forces Assessment and Selection course at Fort Bragg. He became a member of Fulcrum in June 2000. Vincent's surprise return in \\"Chuck Versus the Dream Job\\" makes him the first adversary of Operation Bartowski to have appeared in two non- continuous story arcs (previously, Dr. Jill Roberts and Tommy Delgado appeared in consecutive episodes while Brad White was mentioned and part of his corpse shown in \\"Chuck Versus the Beefcake\\" after his death two episodes previously in \\"Chuck Versus the Suburbs\\"). Vincent has been compared to South Park's Kenny McCormick.Review: April 20, 2009: What's Alan Watching? In his three appearances so far in the series, Vincent was blown-up, shot, poisoned himself, shot again, smashed in a door by Stephen Bartowski, run over with a Dodge Challenger by Chuck, and knocked unconscious in the Intersect control booth by Sarah right before it was destroyed by an air strike. =Theodore \\"Ted\\" Roark= Ted Roark (Chevy Chase) was born on January 23, 1949 in New York, NY. He is the founder and CEO of Roark Instruments and is the nemesis of Stephen J. Bartowski. He is credited with creating some of today's most successful computer technologies. Early in \\"Chuck Versus the Dream Job\\", Stephen tells Chuck that he and Roark were once partners and graduate school classmates, but Roark stole many of his ideas as his own. Despite operating successfully in the United States, his firm has been implicated in several suspect technology transfer deals. He has been under CIA surveillance for at least 18 months. He is in charge of creating the new Intersect for Fulcrum. At the end of \\"Chuck Versus the Dream Job\\", he captures Chuck and his father, now revealed as Orion, and forces Stephen to help him finish the Intersect. The episode revealed few other details about the relationship between Roark and Stephen Bartowski, but Roark did not initially know that Chuck was Stephen's son. Roark reappears in \\"Chuck Versus the Colonel\\". He gives Stephen until the next morning to finish the Intersect, threatening to kill his family. Stephen covertly double-crosses him and reprograms the computer to instead remove the Intersect images from Chuck's head when Roark tries to use it to upload the Intersect into a group of Fulcrum agents. Roark discovers the deception when he fails to flash on any of his test data. After Beckman's airstrike begins, Roark flees and is apparently killed when a bomb detonates near him while trying to get to cover, but the end of the episode reveals he survived the attack and plans to disrupt Ellie's wedding. In \\"Chuck Versus the Ring\\", Roark threatens to kill Ellie if Chuck does not turn over the Intersect, however he is thwarted by Chuck, Sarah, Stephen, Bryce Larkin, and a special forces team led by John Casey. Roark is arrested and detained in a cell in Castle. He is later executed by a member of Casey's team who is subsequently revealed to be a member of a mysterious espionage conglomerate known as \\"the Ring.\\" Roark is mentioned again in the finale, where it is revealed that a device called The Key was split between the three main Intersect designers. Roark kept his piece of the device for Fulcrum's uses. It is suggested on the DVD commentary that Roark is the boss of Fulcrum, although he is still only a subordinate to The Ring. He is ultimately the main antagonist of season two. =Bernie Ominsky= \\"Uncle Bernie\\" (Ken Davitian) is a friend of Jill's father. His code name is Carnivore, perhaps because of his past achievement of eating a 96-ounce steak in less than an hour. He is the one who first recruited Jill to Fulcrum. He would screen Jill's boyfriends and if he didn't approve they would disappear. Jill suggested that he was the only one who would know where Chuck's captured father would be held. To draw him away from his Fulcrum protectors, Jill and Chuck pretend to be engaged and throw a party. When Bernie realizes that Chuck is working with the government, he chases them down and tries to kill him, but dies from a heart attack while attempting to beat Chuck with a baseball bat. His death is counted as Chuck's first confirmed kill.\\"Chuck Versus the First Kill\\" His name is likely a reference to the title character of Weekend at Bernie's. After his death, Casey, Chuck, Jill, and Sarah took him from the Roberts house, pretending that he was still alive by moving him and speaking for him, an obvious homage to this movie. =Bill Bergey= Bill (Christopher Cousins) headed up a major Fulcrum base masquerading as a leadership development center. In addition to detention cells for prisoners and hostages, his facility was also used for recruitment. Team Bartowski infiltrated it in an effort to rescue Stephen Bartowski. Bill identified Chuck and Casey, and had Stephen moved. He attempted to kill Chuck but accidentally defenestrated himself. Chuck tried to save his life, but Bill was killed when his suit sleeve ripped and sent him plummeting to the parking lot fifteen stories down. Bill's sole appearance was in \\"Chuck Versus the First Kill\\". Little other information has been provided on the character, but he seemed surprised that Chuck was willing to save his life whether he talked or not. The Bill Bergey name was actually borrowed from the linebacker who played twelve seasons in the National Football League with the Cincinnati Bengals and Philadelphia Eagles.Full cast and crew for Chuck Versus the First Kill (2009) - The Internet Movie Database (IMDb).Bill Bergey (statistics & history) - Pro- Football-Reference.com. Operatives A number of Fulcrum operatives have been identified by Operation Bartowski over the course of the series. Most of Fulcrum's agents are recruited from within the CIA, and are made up of field operatives and specialists. Fulcrum's recruiting efforts include corporate- style leadership seminars as a front, and Jill Roberts claims that when Fulcrum recruits students, they are given the job of their choice after college as enticement, and this contributes to handlers controlling every aspect of the recruit's life.\\"Chuck Versus the Gravitron\\" =Lizzie Shafai= Lizzie (Noureen DeWulf) was born on July 2, 1981 in Lexington, KY and was given a cover job working as the delivery girl for the Pita Palace restaurant near the Buy More after Tommy's arrest, which she monitored via bugs. Her preferred listening device was the short-range GLG-20, which required a receiver located on-site. Although she took advantage of her looks to deflect attention, Lizzie is a trained killer and quite formidable in hand-to-hand combat. She identified Chuck as the Intersect from her bugs and nearly captured him before being stopped by Sarah. Also, she unknowingly interfered in Devon's proposal plan because she stole Ellie's engagement ring and wanted to keep it for herself, although she lost in a pile of garbage\\"Chuck Versus the Marlin\\" =Juliette= Juliette (Bianca Chiminello) contracted software magnate Von Hayes to crack a stolen microchip containing an upgrade for the Intersect. She was apprehended after being shot by Casey.\\"Chuck Versus the Break-Up\\" =Barry Rommell= Barry Rommell (Zach Hanks) was a Fulcrum agent assigned to eliminate Guy LaFleur, an expert on pathology and biological engineering who uncovered an attempt to develop a deadly strain of influenza as a biological weapon. Little else is known about Rommell, including whether or not this was his real name or an alias. He was shot and killed by Sarah. At the time of his death, he was carrying CIA credentials, and General Beckman positively identified him as a former CIA agent.\\"Chuck Versus the Ex\\" His codename while working for Fulcrum was Wolf Den. =Alexander Winterborne= Alexander Winterborne (Mark Pellegrino) was a Fulcrum agent assigned to follow up on the failed effort to recover a listing of Fulcrum agents from Guy LaFleur. Little else is known about him, other than he was once a member of the CIA Infectious Disease Task Force.NBC.com: Spy Dossiers After his role in the second season, he makes a cameo appearance in the series finale, \\"Chuck Versus the Goodbye\\", when he has a meeting on a plane with Nicholas Quinn. =Jill Roberts= Dr. Jill Roberts (Jordana Brewster) is a prominent figure in the series mythology, though she did not appear until the middle of the second season. Jill is Chuck's ex-girlfriend from Stanford. She has made the most recurring appearances among Fulcrum agents in the series (with four appearances), surpassing Ted Roark and Vincent, who have each made three appearances. =Nathan Rhyerson= Nathan Edward (Ned) Rhyerson (aka Needlenose Ned) (Jed Rees) was born on February 2, 1972 in Glendale, CA. He is unmarried and has no criminal record. He leads Burbank police on a 20-mile high speed car chase before crashing his car into the Burbank Buy More as part of a complex Fulcrum plot to determine the whereabouts of Bryce and the Intersect, as well as to determine who Sarah and Casey were protecting at the Buy More. He pretends to be a frightened and confused amateur criminal, though he was later revealed to be much more capable than he initially let on. Rhyerson is neutralized when Morgan, Big Mike, and Captain Awesome use a pneumatic snow flocking machine to disorient and disarm him.\\"Chuck Versus Santa Claus\\" His name is likely an homage to the character Ned Ryerson from Groundhog Day. =Sylvia Arculin= Sylvia (Jenny McCarthy) was one of the main Fulcrum agents involved in the project to develop the Fulcrum Intersect. She posed as a flirtatious and unfaithful housewife to one of Chuck and Sarah's neighbors while working undercover in a suburban cul-de-sac investigating possible terrorist activity. She attempted to seduce and capture Chuck to test the Fulcrum Intersect on him, however Chuck managed to escape after inadvertently uploading the test database. Sylvia's fate at the end of the episode was not conclusively revealed.\\"Chuck Versus the Suburbs\\" She, along with Cliff, Brad, and Vanessa, appear on the chart hidden behind Chuck's Tron poster. =Cliff Arculin= Cliff's (Brian Thompson) real name is Cliff Siljak, and he was born on April 16, 1958 in Los Angeles, CA. He used to be a top CIA brain scientist. He was shunned by the wider CIA community due to rumors his experiments bordered closer to torture than actual science, which led to his involvement with Fulcrum. He was one of the undercover Fulcrum agents who lived in the Meadow Branch suburban development and was undercover as Sylvia's husband. Cliff apparently survived the activation of the Fulcrum Intersect and is now incarcerated. =Brad White= Brad White (Andy Richter), born June 21, 1966 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was one of several Fulcrum operatives placed in the Meadow Branch suburban development as part of the project to develop the Fulcrum Intersect. As part of his cover, he befriended Chuck and Sarah (who were undercover as a young married couple while investigating the neighborhood under Beckman's orders) intending to use them in the Intersect experiments. He is a former conman. Brad revealed that Fulcrum chose to build its own Intersect after the government abandoned the project, expressing disgust with their decision to rely on Cold War-era counterintelligence techniques. He was killed when Chuck signaled Casey to activate the Fulcrum Intersect, as his brain could not handle the vast amount of data. Later, his grave is dug up by MI-6 agent Cole Barker to retrieve information on the Fulcrum Intersect. =Vanessa White= Vanessa (Alison Simpson) was one of the undercover Fulcrum agents who lived in the Meadow Branch suburban development. She acted as Brad's wife, though it is unclear if the two are actually married. Her fate at the end of the episode is unknown. =Alexis White= Alexis (Katrina Law) was a Fulcrum operative who tried to retrieve the chip taken from Brad White which contained the identity of the Intersect. She commits suicide to avoid capture. Her last words are \\"Fulcrum wins.\\" During Chuck's flash on her in the Buy More, the files show Alexis performing several bloody interrogations on both men and women, suggesting that torture may be her particular specialty.\\"Chuck Versus the Lethal Weapon\\" Alexis was briefly mentioned by General Beckman before a review of the Intersect project by a military panel to counter claims by Daniel Shaw that Chuck was going out of control due to the Intersect. Shaw flashed on Alexis's name, and although Chuck witnessed and recognized that Shaw had flashed, was unable to prove his allegation. Other Fulcrum also has outside contacts. Many of these have been civilians or government workers unaware of the truth of Fulcrum's motives. They are often deceived or coerced into working for Fulcrum. =Bryce Larkin= Fulcrum attempted to recruit Bryce to steal the Intersect. However, Bryce destroyed the Intersect and sent the only copy to Chuck. =Von Hayes= Von Hayes (Steve Valentine) was born on August 31, 1968 in London, England. He is a software engineer hired by Fulcrum to decrypt Intersect refresh data stolen from NSA facilities. When Team Bartowski prevents the delivery of Hayes' decrypted information to Fulcrum, he holds the information hostage, demanding immunity from prosecution and a large cash payment in exchange for his cooperation. He is not a spy and has not been trained in espionage or negotiation. His name is an homage to the outfielder who played twelve seasons in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Phillies, and California Angels.\\"Chuck\\" Characters Keep Being Named After Ex-Athletes And No One Knows Why: Nerve Blogs =Guy Lafleur= Guy Lafleur (William Abadie), born November 28, 1966 in √âvreux, France, is a virologist and the head research scientist for Cole-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals, where he is developing a cure for influenza. His research leads to the development of an antiviral agent that rendered useless one of Cole- Macgregor's most powerful bioweapons. When Lafleur attempts to go public with his findings, he is murdered by a Fulcrum assassin. He works closely with Jill Roberts, Chuck's former girlfriend. Along with his work in virology, he also obtains a list of Fulcrum agents, which he hides on an encrypted flash drive in his hotel room in a puzzle box. He is apparently incredibly paranoid with respect to password security.\\"Chuck Versus the Fat Lady\\" The character's name is borrowed from the Hall of Famer who played seventeen seasons in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Quebec Nordiques.Guy Lafleur - Legends of Hockey. =Howard Busgang= Dr. Howard Busgang (Robert Picardo), born March 7, 1960 in Westport, CT, is a Department of Defense scientist who specializes in mapping the human brain's cognitive and spatial function. He is working for Fulcrum during the development of their version of the Intersect, under the code-name \\"Perseus\\", believing that he is working for the government. Chuck accidentally shot Busgang in the leg when Chuck attempted to rescue Casey and Sarah, and escaped to a hospital. Busgang claimed he did not realize a Human Intersect was possible. He was shot and killed by his Fulcrum handler. He was revealed to have been one of the men involved in designing the Intersect computer, which attracted Fulcrum's attention. In the episode he professed that he did not know who he was really working for, and thought he was working legitimately for the government.

Besides performing, he also contributed to the royal court's repertoire, composing suites to celebrate William III's return to London around 1697 and to celebrate the new year of 1699. He juggled his demands with the King's Musick with duties at the Chapel Royal (where he probably became acquainted with Henry Purcell), of which he was appointed Extraordinary Gentleman on 10 November 1685 and Groom of the Vestry in 1708. Lenton found time outside royal service to compose at least 12 suites for plays produced between 1682 and 1705, mostly for Thomas Betterton's theatre company at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Lenton's later life mostly consisted of editing, writing, and publishing. In 1692, he collaborated with his fellow court musician Thomas Tollett to publish A Consort of Musick of Three Parts. Its sequel, A Three Part Consort of New Musick (1697), became popular enough to warrant three editions. Lenton also edited the fourth volume of Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy (1706) and the second volume of The Dancing Master (1710). Perhaps Lenton's most notable work is The Gentleman's Diversion (1693), which he partially engraved himself. This publication is one of the earliest known extant violin treatises. Scholars had thought that no copies of the work survived, but in 1982, a copy of the first edition was found at the Cardiff public library. At the time, it was proclaimed that Lenton had \\"the honourable (if perhaps temporary) distinction of having written the earliest extant treatise on violin playing in any language.\\"Boyd, Malcolm and John Rayson (July 1982). \\"The Gentleman's Diversion: John Lenton and the First Violin tutor\\".

Classic variations In the late 19th century African-American music began to appear in classical music art forms, in arrangements made by black composers such as Samuel Coleridge- Taylor, Henry Thacker Burleigh and J. Rosamond Johnson. Johnson made an arrangement of \\"Nobody Knows the Trouble I See\\" for voice and piano in 1917, when he was directing the New York Music School Settlement for Colored People. American violinist Maud Powell was the first white solo concert artist to perform classical arrangements of spirituals in concerts, and that is where she also interpreted classical and contemporary pieces by composers like Dvorak and Sibelius. After Powell's suggestion, J. R. Johnson made an arrangement of \\"Nobody Knows the Trouble I See\\" for piano and violin in 1919.

It is endemic to Pohnpei. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher. This is a brilliantly colored, medium-sized kingfisher. Adults are characterized by white underparts, while juveniles are cinnamon below. They have large laterally-flattened bills and dark legs. kingfishers defend permanent territories as breeding pairs and family groups (Kesler 2006). Both sexes care for young, and some offspring remain with parents for extended periods and through subsequent breeding attempts. (Kesler 2002). Birds apparently are obligate termitaria nesters. (Kesler and Haig 2005). Birds can be observed foraging along forest edges and from phone wires. Like other avian species on Pohnpei island, kingfisher populations declined by 63% between 1983 and 1994 surveys (Buden 2000). The cause of Pohnpei bird declines has not yet been identified.

Classification Lowy, in 1951, described a key to the species of Auricularia that emphasized the internal structure of the fruit body, while de-emphasizing traditional characteristics such as color, shape and size, which he considered to be too variable and dependent upon such factors as the age of the specimen, exposure to light, or availability of moisture. The characteristics he emphasized were the presence or absence, width and morphology of the medulla (the part composed mainly or entirely of longitudinal hyphae), and the length of the abhymenial hairs, features that are currently used in defining species in this genus.

Helene Lange (9 April 1848 in Oldenburg ‚Äì 13 May 1930 in Berlin) was a pedagogue and feminist. She is a symbolic figure of the international and German civil rights feminist movement. In the years from 1919 to 1921 she was a member of the Hamburg Parliament. In 1928 she was honoured with the Grand Prussian State Medal (gro√üen preu√üischen Staatsmedaille) \\"For Services to the State\\". Life, education and pedagogy 1974 commemorative postage stamp Helene Lange came from a middle class family in Oldenburg. Her parents were the merchant Carl Theodor Lange and his wife Johanne (born tom Dieck). When she was six years old, her mother died from tuberculosis in 1855, and in 1864 her father died from a stroke, where for one year she came under the legal guardianship of a South-German clergy house. In 1866, when Lange's wish to pursue teacher training was narrowed by her legal guardian's, she took an au pair placement at a boarding school in Petit Ch√¢teau, Alsace, where she gave lessons in German literature and grammar and thus was able to participate in teaching courses. She also began an intensive self-study in Philosophy, history of Literature and Religion, historical science and the ancient languages. In 1867, Lange received a placement as governess in the private household of an industrialist-family in Osnabr√ºck. In 1871 Lange moved to Berlin to prepare for her teacher exam, which she passed. Soon after in 1872, she worked as a private tutor, and immediately committed herself to the emancipation of women and girls through education; and entered the Verein deutscher Lehrerinnen und Erzieherinnen (Association of German Women Teachers and Tutors). From 1874, Lange taught languages at the Krahmerschen H√∂heren M√§dchenschule (Krahmerschen Girls High School) in Lichtenberg near Berlin. Between 1876‚Äì1891 she was active as teacher and director of the seminar class at the Crainschen H√∂heren M√§dchenschule (Crainschen Girls High School), a private Women's College in Berlin, where she also established a seminar for women teachers. Political engagement and feminist movement Porcelain Berlin Memorial Plaque on the house at Kunz-Buntschuh-Stra√üe 7 in Grunewald In 1887, Lange addressed with other women a petition to the Prussian Ministry of Education and the Prussian House of Representatives, that a greater influence of women teachers in public high schools for girls and scientific teacher training for women should be stipulated. The petition was rejected. In the so-called Gelben Brosch√ºre (Yellow Pamphlet), a companion magazine to this petition, Lange summarizes their stance on women's education 'Your goal is the teaching of girls through women, who can better empathize with the essence of girls in their view. To date, most teaching arrangements are held by men'. In 1889, Lange offered Realkurse (middle high-school courses) for women in Berlin, which were converted in 1893 to Gymnasialkurse (high school courses). In 1890, she established the Allgemeinen Deutschen Lehrerinnenverein (General German Women Teachers Association) to represent the interests of female instructors, and takes management of the association. Lange established the magazine Die Frau (The Woman) in 1893, which developed into the most important magazine of the German women's civil rights movement, and from 1893 Lange is on the founding board of the Allgemeinen Deutschen Frauenvereins, the General German Women's Association. In 1894, Lange became board member of the newly founded Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine (Federation of German Women's Associations), the umbrella organization of all German women's associations. However, the Social Democratic women's groups refused to join, because the Federation rejected their sociopolitical demands. From 1898, and due to failing eyesight, Lange lived and worked together with her companion aide the German feminist and politician Gertrud B√§umer. When the International Council of Women met in Berlin in 1894, Helene Lange gave her speech about the importance of women's suffrage; at the conference, she helped founding the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. In 1906, Lange was called upon as an advisor to the Prussian Cultural Administration (preu√üischen Kultusverwaltung), leading in 1908 to the Prussian girls school reform. After abolition of the Prussian Associations Legislation (Preu√üischen Vereinsgesetzgebung) in 1908, which had prohibited women from membership in political parties, Lange joined the left- liberal Freisinnigen Vereinigung (Free-minded Union). Between 1914‚Äì1918 Lange supported during World War I the Nationaler Frauendienst (National Women's Service), which organized women for war support service on the German Fronts of World War I. Between 1917‚Äì1920, Lange and B√§umer lived together in Hamburg, where Lange founded the Soziale Frauenschule (Social Women's School), and worked as a teacher. Later life Grave of honor () at Trakehner Allee 1 in Westend (Berlin) After obtaining in 1919 the active and passive suffrage for women in Weimar Germany, Lange was elected for the German Democratic Party (DDP) to the Hamburg parliament, where she opened their inaugural meeting as the oldest member. In 1920, Lange and B√§umer moved back to Berlin and gradually withdrew from her associations work, but remained active as publicist. She received in 1923 an honorary doctorate of political science from the University of T√ºbingen and 1928 Lange was honoured with the Grand Prussian State Medal (gro√üen preu√üischen Staatsmedaille) \\"For Services to the State\\".

The designation is usually determined by a governmental body, such as a Department of Transportation or a Ministry of Transport. Tourist highway A tourist highway or holiday route is a road that is marketed as being particularly suited for tourists. Tourist highways may be formed when existing roads are promoted with traffic signs and advertising material. Some tourist highways such as the Blue Ridge Parkway are built especially for tourism purposes. Others may be roadways enjoyed by local citizens in areas of unique or exceptional natural beauty, such as the Lake District. Still others, such as the Lincoln Highway in Illinois are former main roads, only designated as \\"scenic\\" after most traffic bypasses them. In the United States this type of roadway is commonly termed a scenic highway. In Europe and other countries around the world, they are often marked with brown tourist signs with the individual route symbol or name, or both. Modern-day sign in New Mexico, along a section of Route 66 named a National Scenic Byway United States Marker used for National Scenic Byways in the United States In the United States, a scenic route may also refer to a type of special route of the U.S. highway system that travels through a particularly beautiful area. These special routes, which boast \\"Scenic\\" banners are typically longer than the \\"parent route\\". There is only one route in the country that remains with the official scenic designation: U.S. Route 40 Scenic in Maryland. Scenic byways in the United States, also include state, National Scenic Byway, National Forest Scenic Byways and Bureau of Land Management Back Country Byways programs which designate roads or routes as scenic byways due to some unique characteristics. National Parkways are scenic roads in the National Park System built for recreational driving through scenic or historic areas. Unlike most scenic routes, National Parkways are built with a buffer of park land along both sides of the roadway. They also may have large satellite parks or recreation areas built periodically along their length. Most National Historic Trails are commemorative motor routes which follow historic pathways. Theme routes Theme routes are special theme-based tours, aimed at providing a visitor or tourist with a better insight on that theme. Being popular in Europe, they can cover anything from an individual city, a wine growing region, Dutch tulip fields, Swiss Mountains, to Norwegian Fjords.

Issues The M44s relatively small production numbers were due, like all U.S. BZ munitions, to a number of shortcomings. The M44 dispensed its agent in a cloud of white, particulate smoke. This was especially problematic because the white smoke was easily visible and BZ exposure was simple to prevent; a few layers of cloth over the mouth and nose are sufficient. There were a number of other factors that made BZ weapons unattractive to military planners. BZ had a delayed and variable rate-of-action, as well as a less than ideal \\"envelope-of-action\\". In addition, BZ casualties exhibited bizarre behavior, 50 to 80 percent had to be restrained to prevent self-injury during recovery.

The parish church in the center of the village is dedicated to Saint James.Roman Catholic Church in Slovenia site History Alpine Slavs, ancestors of the present-day Slovenes, settled the area in the 7th century. In the Middle Ages, the villages belonged to the Lombard Kingdom, the Frankish Empire, and finally to the Patriarchate of Aquileia. Between 1420 and 1797, Livek belonged to the Republic of Venice and was part of the historical region known as Venetian Slovenia. In 1797, it was acquired by the Habsburg Monarchy. Already in 1805, it was included in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. In 1813 it was regained by the Austrians. Although the vast majority of the region of Venetian Slovenia was included in Austrian Lombardy-Venetia, Livek was placed in the administrative region known as the Kingdom of Illyria. In 1849, it became part of the Austrian Littoral. In 1866, when the Veneto and Friuli regions were acquired by Italy, Livek remained in the Austrian Empire, becoming a border village. Livek became known during World War I, when it became an important strategic location during the Battle of Caporetto. A unit of the German Army commanded by Erwin Rommel, who later became a German Field Marshal in World War II, seized the village and used it as a base from where they took the strategically crucial Mount Matajur. Rommel's small unit managed to defeat the Italian defense that numbered 150 officers, 9,000 men, and 81 pieces of artillery.

The captives in the winning team get the chance to be chosen by Sting or Claw to be in their teams. If there is a 1 vs 1 battle, the captive that wins is guaranteed of being in one of the teams. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Sting and Claw take part in this challenge against each other with an added element to make it more hard. The winning teams gets their captive they have chosen, and the losing team's captive goes back to camp with nothing. The team that won the previous Ultimate Jeopardy chooses first and goes first in the challenge. * Survival Challenge - The Limbo captives must do a task such as shooting darts or fishing. If they lose their challenge, they get a Forfeit such as no cutlery to eat their food with or being linked in pairs for the rest of the day. If they pass, then everything continues as normal for Limbo. * Island Fire - The Island Fire selects the captain's for Sting and Claw, and also reveals the name of the next challenge. * Stone of Selection - The Stone of Selection selects which Limbo captives will be playing the next Limbo Challenge. Power Plays The Power Plays are special advantages that are held by Limbo captives. They may only use their power play when they are on Sting or Claw. The captives are supposed to keep their power play a secret, but if they reveal their secret to someone in Claw or Sting before they're released from Limbo, their power play is passed on to someone else. * Swap - Allows the player to swap a member on the opposing team who is playing a challenge for someone else who isn't participating. Held by Ayla and used in Stretched to the Limit to swap Anna with Olivia. * False Start - Allows the player to stop the challenge they are currently playing and start again. It can only be used within the first 60 seconds of the challenge. Held by Lachlan and used in Reckless Rally to restart the round after the buggy got stuck. * Head Start - Allows the player to start a challenge before their rival team. Originally held by Livvi but given to Sammy because of her leg injury and used in The Crush Rush to start 6 seconds before the boulder. * Freeze - Allows the player to stop their rival team continuing for twenty seconds. Held by Alex T and used in Vertigo to stop Sting for twenty seconds, but unfortunately his team lost that round.  List of Challenges  Note: Episode count are based in Australian airing (in which 2 half hour episodes are show for each day on the island). UK airs 1 hour episodes for each day. = Day 1 (Episodes 1 and 2) = * Sky High Scramble - The teams would have to climb up a series of logs and reach their team flag and make their way down. However, the steps get bigger the higher they go up. The first team to get the opposing teams flag and reach the ground wins * Challenge - Olivia, Alex and Cameron from Sting vs Sammy, Jake and Tara from Claw. * Reward: - The first choice of camps: Tree Camp or Boat Camp. On the first day at Scorpion Island, all six of the original members skydived on Scorpion Island from a height of 4000 metres ready to take part in the challenges that the island has waiting. Meanwhile, ten members were locked up in a crate hanging from a helicopter and landed on the island as well. Unfortunately, all of them are Limbo captives. In the first challenge, Sting were leading earlier, but one of the logs broke just as they got their team flag and ended up hanging on another log. Claw later had the lead, but not only did one of the stepping logs broke, Tara dropped their team flag just as she was about to put it in her pocket. It was neck and neck as they both descended the challenge. Claw got to the ground first, but had to go to Sting's side to reclaim their flag, but it was too late and Sting won the challenge. Sting chose Boat Camp, leaving Claw with Tree Camp. At the Stone of Selection, the Limbo captives were selected one at a time to see if they would be playing the next challenge. Four Limbo captives (Ayla, Lachlan, Alex T. and Livvi) were not selected and were told that they were secret Power Players. = Day 2 (Episodes 3 and 4) = * One False Move - Teams have to grab bamboo poles from a set of poles hanging over the rapid river while trying not to get the other poles from falling. One point for every pole removed by a team. One point lost for every pole that falls into the river. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the player who had to remove the bamboo poles also had their hands tied together. * Limbo Challenge - Anna, Cai and Lizzie for Blue Team vs. Ollie, Amy and Jack for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Olivia, Alex and Cameron from Sting vs Sammy, Jake and Tara from Claw. * Reward - Anna if Sting win or Cai if Claw win. * Survival Challenge - The captives had to send and receive a message in morse code and decipher it correctly. * Forfeit - If the code is deciphered incorrectly, no talking in Limbo for the rest of the evening. In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie went first and only dropped one pole but grabbed another. Anna went next and easily grabbed a pole. When it came to Ollie again, he dropped 22 other poles and lost the challenge for his team since it was impossible for the white team to catch up. As a result, the blue team won the challenge and the white team returned to Limbo. In the Ultimate Jeopardy, Team Sting dropped a few poles early on, and just as Team Claw was about to win it with their last pole, Sammy dropped five. That mistake cost them victory and Team Sting won Anna. In the Survival Challenge, despite Alex T struggling with the code and Lachlan and Ollie fighting for leadership, the captives passed the challenge. = Day 3 (Episodes 5 and 6) = * Decks Of Doom - Two players from each team had to make their way on cables from one end to the other using only three skateboard decks in mid-air. Once they arrive to their destination, they grab the skull to win. If they lose all three decks, they must go back to the start. In Ultimate Jeopardy, one of the players had to be blindfolded while holding a rope with a skull. They must replace a skull at the end for the skull they are holding to win. * Limbo Challenge - Alex T and Amy for White Team vs. Ayla and Jack for Blue Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Cameron and Anna from Sting vs Sammy and Jake from Claw. * Reward - Jack if Sting win or Ayla if Claw win. * Survival Challenge - The captives had to catch fish in the river for their evening meal with the fishing equipment. * Forfeit - If no one caught a fish, there would be basic rations in camp. In the Limbo Challenge, Alex T kept falling and felt frustrated, while Jack and Ayla worked together to get to the end. Even Jack cheered for Alex T showing how valuable he is as a player. In the end, the Blue Team won and the White Team returned to Limbo. Sting wanted Jack, leaving Claw fighting for Ayla, despite they wanted Jack as well because he was a strong male player for Jake. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Cameron gave a valiant effort while Anna was blindfolded. As for Jake and Sammy, despite they fell once, they took a lot of time making progress. Even though Team Sting was much faster, they kept falling off. In the end, Claw won and not only did they gain Ayla, they also had the Power Play, 'Swap', which was a great advantage for Claw, for if they had chosen Jack, they wouldn't have received a Power Play. In the Survival Challenge, eventually, Lizzy caught a tiny fish in the river and they did not receive the forfeit. Alex T fell in backwards and got soaked. = Day 4 (Episodes 7 and 8) = * Fearfall - One player has to ascend and descend on Skeleton Falls while removing coconuts from little bags strung down the waterfall. To help them up, another player will be pulling ropes to ascend and descend that player while another player will be giving directions. The team that releases all their coconuts and gets to the top first wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the climber of the waterfall had to get one coconut at a time and were being hauled up high to place it up on top of a crate. The first team to put all eight coconuts on the crate and release their team coloured balls wins. * Limbo Challenge - Cai, Lachlan and Lizzie for Blue Team vs. Livvi, Ollie and Jack for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Olivia, Alex and Cameron from Sting vs Tara, Sammy and Ayla from Claw. * Reward - Lachlan if Sting win or Cai if Claw win. * Survival Challenge - The Limbo captives had to play 'Chinese Whispers', but before passing the message on to the next person, each captive had to fulfill a certain task such as spelling their name backwards, name all their members in Limbo, run around the group twice, peel and eat a banana and do ten star jumps. * Forfeit - If the message is finished incorrectly, the captives were being tethered together in pairs for the rest of the day. In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie struggled again and in the end, Cai, Lachlan and Lizzie won. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Jake wasn't happy for not being selected to take part in the challenge saying that girls alone won't win this challenge. Ayla was climbing and being pulled by Tara while Sammy was the spotter. As a result, Jake was right. Ayla was a good climber being as strong as Olivia, but halfway through she started losing it which gave Olivia a chance to catch up and go ahead. Claw worked very well together but due to some gear and the steep slant on their side of the waterfall, they had some trouble and lost. Sting, with Olivia, Cameron and Alex playing won, and gained Lachlan, including a Power Play, \\"False Start\\". During the survival challenge, the message changed when Amie was distracted by her task, which made everyone else change it more, and the group was tied together in pairs. The pairs were as follows: * Alex T and Cai * Amy and Jack * Lachlan and Ollie * Livvi and Lizzie However, the group made the situation good by getting to know each other, especially Lachlan and Ollie after leadership complaints during their first survival challenge. The group also did things like tying shoelaces, playing limbo and going around a pole. = Day 5 (Episode 9 and 10) = * Above and Beyond - Teams have to try and match sixteen coloured scorpions. One puzzle board from above and the other board from below. The winning team is the one who makes the most matches before a leaky barrel that is holding the person up runs out of water. In case of a tie, the team who matches the fastest wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the scorpions on the high puzzle board are replaced with slimey eggs. * Limbo Challenge - Amy, Lizzie, Ollie for Blue Team vs. Alex T, Cai, Livvi for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Olivia, Anna and Lachlan from Sting vs Ayla, Sammy and Jake from Claw. * Reward - Cai if Sting win or Livvi if Claw win. * Survival Challenge - The Limbo captives had to build a bridge over the river, have one person cross it without touching the water, collect a flaming torch, and bring it back. * Forfeit - If the person crossing touches the water, there would be no electricity or power in Limbo for the night. During the Stone of Selection, Livvi believed that whoever was in the white team would lose because in all the Limbo Challenges, the white team had lost. Also, this was the first time Jack wasn't selected to take part in the Limbo Challenge. In the Limbo Challenge, despite Ollie had a better performance compared to his previous Limbo Challenges, the Blue team's time of 2:44 wasn't quick enough to beat the White Team's time of 2:29. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Sting made 13 matches and Claw made 10. As a result, Sting won and gained Cai. In the Survival Challenge, despite a few arguments, the Limbo captives completed the challenge with Livvi safely returning the torch and avoided the forfeit. = Day 6 (Episode 11 and 12) = * Pedal of Peril - One by one, each player had to ride a push bike over a very wobbly bridge. If no one completes it, the player who covers the most distance wins it for their team. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the teams had to ride on petrol powered scooters. * Limbo Challenge - Amy, Alex T and Lizzie for Blue Team vs. Jack, Livvi and Ollie for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Cameron and Anna from Sting vs Tara and Jake from Claw. * Reward - Amy if Sting win or Lizzie if Claw win. * Survival Challenge - One person had to hide behind a fence and describe every player's belongings on the table without saying what it was or who it belonged to. The rest of the group had to identify what it was and who it belonged to. * Forfeit - If any objects are no identified, the island would confiscate them. In the Limbo Challenge, no one crossed the bridge completely but Amie of the blue team covered the most distance by a whisker over Jack of the white team. Before Ultimate Jeopardy, Anna, who was the captain of Sting, selected Amie. Jake, who was the captain of Claw selected Lizzy as he believed she has done well through the past Limbo Challenges. Jake wanted another guy for their team, but didn't choose Alex T and also missed out on the Freeze Power Play. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Cameron went first in his run while Anna was cheering for him, but Tara covered her mouth to stop her cheering. Cameron reached around halfway through the bridge. Tara went second and she too reached the halfway mark despite getting the accelerator and brake mixed up. Anna went third, she had an amazing sencce for balance but she thought that extending her leg would help her turn the scooter but didn't know that she had to use the handles to turn it. As soon as she fell, Lizzie was hugging Jake from her cage believing she'll be freed from Limbo. Jake went last, he used Cameron's original idea of going very fast to avoid wobbling. He fell only few inches before the end and covered the most distance of the all. In the end, Jake and Tara covered the most distance than Cameron and Anna and won the challenge. As a result, Claw gained Lizzie. At the special River Camp, Lizzie overcame her fear of deep water. In the Survival Challenge, Amy described all the objects and each one was identified by the other captives. = Day 7 (Episode 13 and 14) = * The Last Gasp - Each player had to get a skull out of a net and throw it on top of a pontoon. After six skulls, they must return to the start, grab a skull from underwater and place it on a floating holder. The team who swims the course the quickest time wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the players had a skull tied on the rope through the holes in the pontoons. The player must then dive down, open the chest on the bottom of the river to free the team skull and carry it back to the start and put it on the floating holder. * Limbo Challenge - Alex T for Blue Team vs. Ollie for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Alex Y from Sting vs Jake from Claw. * Reward - Ollie for the winning team and the participating player from the losing team will go to Limbo. * Survival Challenge - Each captive had two shots to use a blowdart and hit one different sized item each. They must hit 4 out of 5 items to avoid the forfeit. * Forfeit - If the captives hit less than four items, all of them would have to eat in the dark. At the Island Fire in the previous night, the teams found out that the team that will lose the next Ultimate Jeopardy would have to sacrifice their participating player to Limbo. Tara who was the team captain of Claw chose Jake to play and Sting's captain Alex Y of Sting chose himself. When they left, Sting thought Alex Y was brave to be offered as their sacrifice, especially Anna who thought she was the weakest link after losing both of her challenges since joining the team. Tara on the other hand felt really bad for choosing anyone in the team and losing them. She was deciding on either Jake or Lizzie to take part in the challenge, but the rest of the team believed that Jake will win the Ultimate Jeopardy and gain a new member for their team. After Claw won their last challenge and Lizzy, Sting decided to trash Claw's Tree Camp by doing things like turning their furniture upside down and taking bites out of their fruit. When Claw came back, they were not happy that Sting did it to their camp and believed that they were sore losers, since they won four of the six challenges so far. Claw decided to confront Sting about this. Sting denied that they trashed their camp. Claw knew that it was them because Lachlan left a toy snake at their camp. They said that they will get their revenge by winning the next challenge. In the Survival Challenge, each Limbo captives had to select a target (between an egg, a grapefruit, a melon, a pineapple and a watermelon) and had only two shots to make the target. They all got a practice shot at the melon because it was medium-sized. Livvi went for the egg because she hit the melon in the centre, Jack went for the grapefruit, Amie went for the melon, Ollie went for the pineapple and Alex T went for the watermelon for completely missing the melon. Alex T hit the watermelon in his first shot, Ollie missed the pineapple in both attempts, Amy just hit the bottom of the melon in her second attempt and Jack just missed the grapefruit, so Livvi didn't need to go for the egg because the group failed the challenge. As a result, they all had to eat in the dark. Despite having to do the forfeit, the Limbo captives made a bad situation fun by having a food fight in the dark. In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie completed the course in 2:19 and Alex T, despite not having too much confidence in water, his time of 2:36 was not enough to win the Limbo Challenge. Therefore, Ollie was the prize for the winning team in Ultimate Jeopardy. In Ultimate Jeopardy both of the players had problems with the challenge. Jake went first and thought it would be faster if he tried to pull the rope from the last hole. The tactic badly misfired and the skull got stuck 3 times losing Jake around 20 seconds to free it. Alex freed the skull from the first pontoon but he lost it, he went back to find it not knowing and seeing that the skull was tied to a rope and that Jake went to next pontoon and pulled it from there. He also made it harder for himself because he had to carry the skull. In the end, Jake's time of 4:11 was better than Alex Y's time of 4:22, meaning Jake won the challenge for Team Claw. As a result, Claw gained Ollie and Sting's Alex had to go to Limbo. If Sting won Ultimate Jeopardy instead, Claw would be down to four members while Sting would have seven members. Instead, Claw now lead with six members to Sting's five members. = Day 8 (Episode 15 and 16) = * Stretched to the Limit - The teams have to grab 9 giant puzzle pieces from the beach while being attached to a bungie cord, and get the pieces to the puzzle board in the middle of the sea on a pontoon. The Team that solves the puzzle in the quickest time wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the teams are attached to the same bungie cord similar to tug of war, and the puzzle board is on the beach along with the pieces. The team that solves the puzzle first wins. * Limbo Challenge - Amy and Jack for Blue Team vs. Alex T and Livvi for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Lachlan, Cameron and Anna from Sting vs Ayla, Sammy, Lizzy from Claw. * Reward - Jack if Sting win or Amy if Claw win. * Survival Challenge - The captives had to put the correct weights on three different sets of scales to balance them. * Forfeit - If the scales are not balanced, all captives would be tethered to the ground in Limbo. After Sting's Alex lost the last challenge and went to Limbo, the captives made a welcoming to him by putting face paints on each other representing Limbo. The Stone of Selection didn't select Alex for the next challenge, but he was alright about and decided to use it for a rest day. In the Limbo Challenge, Jack and Amy had a good start, although Jack had a much difficult time getting the puzzle pieces compared to Amy. In addition, the pair didn't got along well by not talking to each other. Eventually, they managed to get all the pieces to the puzzle board and quickly completed the puzzle thanks to Amy taking control of solving the puzzle. As for Alex T and Livvi, despite the both of them having a tough time getting the puzzle pieces, both of them worked well together by talking to each other and even held hands, showing great teamwork, but Livvi fell a couple of times. Unfortunately, their great teamwork was not enough to win the challenge because they were slower to complete the puzzle. Before the Ultimate Jeopardy, Claw's captain Ayla decided to use her power play, \\"Swap\\". Originally, Sting's captain Lachlan selected Cameron and Olivia to take part with him in Ultimate Jeopardy. After Ayla discussed with her team members, Ayla decided to swap Olivia for Anna. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Lizzie from Claw took a huge lead getting the pieces first and started placing them, while Sting struggled getting their pieces. Later, Cameron gained some composure by throwing the pieces to their puzzle board and pulled Claw away from their puzzle board, making Lizzie struggle to get a footing. Unfortunately, with Lizzy who had only one piece to put into place and Cameron taking way too long to complete the puzzle, Lizzie managed to slam the final piece into its position to claim victory for Claw. As a result, for winning the Ultimate Jeopardy, Claw gained Amy. Ayla took a big step in leading here as she cheered a lot for her team. When Lizzy was regaining her strength lying on the sand, Sammy and Ayla had to keep their footing. If they hadn't pulled their weight, Claw would have flung back against Sting. In the Survival Challenge, all the scales were just balanced and the group did not receive the forfeit. = Day 9 (Episode 17 and 18) = * Reckless Rally - The teams must drive a buggy around a twisty terrain course to knock their team skull off a boulder. If they knock a skull off a post, they get a 10-second time penalty. The Team that drives around the course in the fastest time wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the driver is blindfolded and a passenger has to give out directions. * Limbo Challenge - Jack for Blue Team vs. Alex Y for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Cai and Lachlan from Sting vs Oliver and Jake from Claw. * Reward - Alex Y for the winning team and a participating player from the losing team will go to Limbo. * Survival Challenge - The Limbo captives must put on blindfolds and nose pegs and correctly identify a series of foods by taste. * Forfeit - If the food is guess incorrectly, the captives would have to eat with chopsticks for their evening meal. On the previous night at the Island Fire, the teams found that the Limbo Challenge will be another 1 on 1. The Winning Team will get the Winner of the Limbo Challenge and the losing team will have to sacrifice either their team captain or the player they had chosen to take part in the challenge to Limbo. In the Limbo Challenge, Jack carefully drove around the course and only got one time penalty, but Alex, who had experience, drove around much quicker and won the challenge. He even almost broke the buggy's engine. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Jake was driving blindfolded with Ollie guiding him for Claw. Ollie easily managed to guide Jake, really focused and with Jake being really calm, with a minor number of mistakes and only knocking off one skull. At the Island Fire the previous night, Cai, who was the captain for Sting, chose Lachlan to compete with him because he had a Power Play, False Start, which he decided to use. During Sting's run, Cai ended up getting stuck on the course so they both used the Power Play, False Start. In Sting's second run, Cai went so fast, Lachlan was shouting directions, Olivia and Anna were really nervous yelling to them to slow down, while Alex Y. was shouting directions and things like What are you doing?, Stop! They knocked down five skulls, which made team Claw happy thinking that there is no way they could lose. Overall, Sting knocked down five skulls giving them a 50-second time penalty to Claw's one, giving them a 10-second penalty. Despite Sting's 50 second time penalty, they finished the course in 4 minutes and 15 seconds while Claw finished it in 4 minutes and 18 seconds. Therefore, Sting managed to gain Alex Y back. This also meant that Ollie had to decide whether Jake or himself would be going back to Limbo. Ollie didn't want to send Jake, an original member, so he decided to send himself to Limbo. In the Survival Challenge, all the captives managed to identify the foods which were onion, lemon and garlic. They didn't like the taste of them and all spat them out. Jack ate the lemon, Alex Y ate the onion and Alex T ate all three with Jack telling him that he is weird. = Day 10 (Episode 19 and 20) = * Over the Edge - The Teams must run and jump off a platform at the top of Skeleton Falls with a baseball bat to hit skulls being held up by the other player in six jumps. The Team that hits the most skulls wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, one player must hold up another player which will be throwing skulls to the other player for them to hit in eight jumps. * Limbo Challenge - Alex T and Jack for Blue Team vs. Livvi and Ollie for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Olivia, Alex Y and Lachlan from Sting vs Lizzie, Amy and Sammy from Claw. * Reward - Jack if Sting win or Alex T if Claw win. * Survival Challenge - The Limbo captives must transfer enough water using buckets to a large container to remove a weight in five minutes. * Forfeit - If the container isn't filled after five minutes, all Limbo captives have to eat without any cutlery. Ollie went back to Limbo after his team lost against Sting. The other captives asked him questions about what Claw was like. After Claw lost Ollie, Tara wanted revenge on Sting for making nasty comments, saying \\"In your face\\" towards them. All the members of Claw went to Sting's camp, unattended and trashed their Boat Camp and left. They Wound up the hammocks, took the furniture out of the camp and Put the table near a log upside down. When Sting returned, they thought it was silly that Claw did the same things Sting did to their camp. They also didn't think it was appropriate. In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie wasn't close enough to hit the skulls in his first two runs, which made him frustrated. He managed to hit two skulls later on but then, he still couldn't get closer to hitting them. On Jack's turn, he wasn't close enough to the skulls, but managed to hit two skulls on his next run. Later, he managed to hit two more skulls making a total of four. On his last run though, he accidentally hit broken skulls he already had hit, but Jack and Alex T were the winners. In the Survival Challenge, Jack and Ollie ran with the buckets while Alex T handed them to Livvi who poured the water in the container. They took 4 minutes and 54 seconds to complete the challenge so they avoided the forfeit. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Olivia held up Lachlan to throw skulls to Alex Y for Sting, and Lizzy held up Sammy to throw skulls to Amie for Claw. During Claw's turn, Amie missed the first two skulls but then hit another on her third go. Later, the team had worked on a pattern for throwing which made a total of five skulls. In Sting's turn, Alex Y first hit a skull on his second go. On his third go, he jumped too hard and accidentally spined through the air, but he managed to hit another skull directly above Lachlan. Sting's total was six skulls, making them the winner and they gained Jack. = Day 11 (Episode 21 and 22) = * Tower of Strength - The Teams must use milk crates to build a tower all the way to the golden skull at the top. If the tower falls apart, the team will have to start over again. The first team to grab the skull wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, single stacks of crates can only be built and one member must give the milk crates to their partner. * Limbo Challenge - Alex T for Blue Team vs. Ollie for White Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Cameron and Jack from Sting vs Lizzie and Amy from Claw. * Reward - Ollie for the winning team. * Survival Challenge: - The captives had to eat live ants. * Forfeit - If any captives refuse to eat the ants, all of their food would be delivered in blocks of ice. After Jack had left Limbo and there were only three captives left, Livvi felt that since Jack had gone, she thought the reasons that she and Alex T had always been in Limbo were because all of the better captives had already been picked. This is not true however, as she and Alex T have been commented by Sting and Claw saying that they had done well in challenges and sometimes had been chosen by them to go on their teams. At the Stone of Selection, Livvi was originally stung to play the next challenge against Ollie, but her leg injury had not made her feel well enough that she was forced to not do the challenge and Alex T was chosen instead. In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie built his tower slowly and carefully so it wouldn't fall over, while Alex T was rushing too much, causing some of the crates to not be locked and making him fall. Ollie had stacked 19 crates into two towers to stand on, but as he was going to put his last one, the tower fell. Alex had slightly got into the lead but, some of the crates did not lock in and he fell, but Ollie soon managed to make another one. As Ollie decided to jump for the skull he missed and his tower fell over again. Alex T started to get higher with his tower, and he kept psyching Ollie out. Ollie then managed to make his tower again and decided to reach out to the gold skull. Alex T, despite being lower than Ollie, decided to jump for it as well as Ollie was closer. Alex T. jumped first and missed, then Ollie jumped and caught the skull, which meant that he was escaping from Limbo again, though Claw would need to win Ultimate Jeopardy to win him back. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Amy built her towers carefully, but when it came jumping off them, she would always misjudge her jump. Sting's Cameron was slower than Amy and kept having falls, but not as much as Claw's tower. When both teams had around nine crates stacked, Cameron decided to jump to the skull for his second go and Amie for her third go. Amie jumped first and missed again, then Cameron jumped carefully and caught the skull thus, Sting had won the challenge and gained Ollie. After the challenge, just as everyone left, a cage fell down on Lizzie and Amy and they were trapped. Back at Claw's camp, the other members worried what happened to the girls and thought that maybe they went to Sting or Limbo. In the Survival Challenge, all three captives successfully ate the ants. Alex T ate lots of them as he liked the ants' taste. He even picked up a whole leaf of them and ate ants off it. Livvi only ate one but didn't like it and she felt nauseous seeing them. Ollie ate a few and he even had a fight with one of them biting in his mouth, while all of them experienced some ant bites. Alex T hoped they would still be there the next day. At the Island Fire, JK and Joel told Claw a message from the island. The island had captured Lizzie and Amy as a punishment for losing the challenge, and they were held prisoner in Limbo. The good news was that they could be won back in the next challenge. = Day 12 (Episode 23 and 24) = * Rollin' Thunder - A ship called the Shattered Skull has sailed in. The teams must hold on to a giant spindle above shark invested waters and stay on as long as possible. The team that stays on the spindle the longest wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the spindle is covered in slime and opposing members can throw skull sponges to try to make them fall off. * Limbo Challenge - Alex T for White Team vs. Lizzie for Blue Team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Olivia and Lachlan from Sting vs Tara and Sammy from Claw. * Reward - Amy and Lizzie for the winning team and Alex T and Livvi for the losing team. Lizzie and Amy were gutted that they were in Limbo again, but hoped that they could get back on to Claw soon. The rest of Claw were not acting like normal. Jake decided that he needed to encourage the team more. At the Stone of Selection, all the captives were selected with Alex T and Livvi on one team and Lizzy and Amie on the other. It was discovered that all of them were going to be leaving Limbo today, with the winners of Ultimate Jeopardy getting the players who won the Limbo Challenge, and the losing team would get the players that lost the Limbo Challenge. Livvi's leg had not been well and if she wasn't able to play, then it would be a 1 vs 1 challenge. In the Limbo Challenge, since Livvi had a leg injury, Alex T had to do two rounds of Rollin' Thunder. As a result, this meant that only Amie or Lizzy must compete against Alex T for fairness. Amie chose Lizzy to take part in the challenge. Unfortunately, Alex T lasted for 45 seconds long and Lizzy lasted 5 minutes 49 seconds for their first go. Alex T lasted for around one minute, meaning that Lizzy and Amie were clear winners. Lizzy decided to have a second turn, to beat her personal record. She lasted an incredible 8 minutes 56 seconds before calmly getting off. She'd even let go of the spindle at some points to trick them. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Lachlan from Sting lasted 1 second on the spindle and Livvi and Alex started laughing at him. Tara from Claw lasted for 10 seconds. Olivia from Sting however, managed to stay on for 4 minutes and 10 seconds, while Claw had used up all their skulls to throw. She even got a skull hit on her head. Sammy from Claw however, only stayed on for 4 seconds, because of her height not big enough to hold on to the spindle. As a result, Sting won and gained Lizzie and Amy, while Claw not only gained Alex T and Livvi, but also gained two new power plays, \\"Freeze\\" and \\"Head Start\\". At the end of the day, there was no one left in Limbo, therefore the camp, the Survival Challenge and the Stone of Selection no longer exist. At the Island Fire, J.K and Joel told the teams that they had two chances to win members of their opposing team. = Day 13 (Episode 25 and 26) = * The Crush Rush - In the first round, the teams must run down a jungle track with a giant boulder chasing them. The players have to swing on a rope, crawl under a net and run through a muddy pond in the course. The team that runs the whole course in the quickest time or gets the furthest distance before the boulder touches them, wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the teams have to run in pairs while carrying a totem pole during the course. * First Round - Amy and Anna from Sting vs Sammy and Jake from Claw * Reward: - The choice of a member to win from the opposing team. * Second Round - Olivia and Lizzy from Sting vs Tara and Ayla from Claw * Reward: - Olivia if Claw win or Olivia won back to Sting if they win. Before the challenge, Livvi decided to use her power play, \\"Head Start\\". However, since Livvi sustained a leg injury, Sammy would be the one with the power play, but Livvi had control when to use it, which is why Livvi nominated Sammy to play. In the first round, Amy went first for Sting. Amie was going well until she got her shirt stuck in the net, slowing her down. Luckily, she was not flatten by the boulder, despite falling over twice. Sammy from Claw went next, who had her Power Play which made her start six seconds before the boulder started to roll. Sammy made a big distance so that the boulder would not be close. It turns out though, that she was slower than Amy at the first six seconds. Next was Anna's turn for Sting. Anna ran very fast, and ploughed her head through the net before finishing. Last was Jake for Claw. Jake went very fast, and even though he got stuck in the net, he didn't run out of breath and finished with a time of 31 seconds. The final results were Amie on 4th place, Sammy and Anna tied 2nd place and Jake in 1st place, meaning that Claw won the round, and had a choice from one of the ten players from Sting to play for. Claw decided to steal Olivia, who would be their prize if they win Ultimate Jeopardy. The first team to start in Ultimate Jeopardy was Claw with Tara and Ayla. They ran until they got to the scramble net and the boulder hit them. Next was Olivia and Lizzie for Sting. Sting also got to the scramble net and were hit. On Claw's second go, Tara and Ayla were very close to the boulder and at one point, it hit Tara's rear. She and Ayla didn't know this and they ran straight on to the end. In Sting's second run, Olivia had let go of the totem pole at one point leaving Lizzie carrying it by herself until they got to the scramble net, they also made it to the end. It turned out that Claw was disqualified for not stopping when the boulder hit Tara, and Sting was disqualified when Lizzie and Olivia were both not holding on to the totem pole, which made the results determined by their first run. The winners were Sting, because they were further in the scramble net than Claw, so Sting kept Olivia and the team celebrated back at camp. = Day 14 (Episode 27 and 28) = * Vertigo - In the first round, the teams must climb up very long ladders and undo six flags. After the team undoes a flag they must climb down to the bottom and climb up again to the next flag. Once all flags have been undone, the team must try to hit a team skull at the top with a baseball bat. The first team to hit the skull wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the ladder is 9 metres long and three members will support the ladder. * Limbo Challenge - Cameron, Cai and Oliver from Sting vs Alex T, Jake and Tara from Claw * Reward: - The choice of a member to win from the opposing team. * Ultimate Jeopardy - Alex Y, Amy, Lachlan and Lizzie from Sting vs Alex T, Ayla, Livvi and Sammy from Claw. * Reward: - Jake if Sting win or Jake won back to Claw if they win. At the Island Fire the previous night, Alex T from Claw used his Power Play, Freeze for Vertigo. In the first round, both teams were having trouble getting their ladder upright. Cai was the climber for Sting and Jake was Claw's climber. Jake was the first person to undo a flag, but Cai shortly caught up, while Claw were having problems of their own. Later on, Sting had pulled down their fourth flag, Alex T shouted Freeze, and Sting stopped for twenty seconds, while Claw caught up, though Jake was a little slow from going now the ladder. Soon later, Sting had untied all their flags and were getting ready to hit their skull and Claw were almost about to do the same. Jake and Cai were both swinging everywhere on the top of the ladders while the other team members tried to keep their climber still. Just as Claw was close to hitting their skull, Jake fell off the ladder, and there wasn't enough time for him to get back up as Cai managed to hit the team skull meaning Sting had won the first round, and they had a choice of one of Claw's six members. Meanwhile, the other members of Claw were watching and thought that Jake's last fall looked as if he did it on purpose and they thought he was going up the ladder rather slowly. At Sting's camp, while the team were packing up their luggage for going back home, Alex Y and Lachlan were both arguing over who owned a piece of rope. Olivia decided to settle this and made them do tug- of-war over the rope. The boys were pulling the rope until Lachlan decided to let go, which made Alex Y fall over and win. Lachlan didn't really care anymore because it was only a piece of rope. After some members of Claw noticed Jake's movements in the first round of Vertigo thinking he was losing on purpose, Olivia noted that Jake did say to some members of her team that he originally wanted to be in Sting. Jake truthfully denied that he was losing on purpose, and said that the challenge was really hard and he was not good with heights. Both teams did not realise this. After winning the first round, Sting chose Jake to steal from Claw. Before Ultimate Jeopardy, because Claw had six members and there needed to be four players in the challenge, Ayla, Livvi and Sammy had to take part, and captain Alex T was forced to do the challenge again. Sting's captain Cameron on the other hand chose Alex Y, Amy, Lachlan and Lizzie. In Ultimate Jeopardy, Alex Y was the climber for Sting while Sammy was the climber for Claw. Neither of the teams ladders fell over and the climbers didn't fall off. Both teams were almost neck and neck, but Sammy was much faster, ripping off the flags as she went, while Alex Y was a little slower. Soon, Sammy had got rid of Claw's flags and was ready to hit the team skull. Alex Y was also ready to hit Sting's skull shortly after. Despite having slight wobbles, Sammy got up to the top of the ladder and hit the team skull, meaning Claw had won the challenge, and successfully defending Jake. Back at camps, Sting discussed that they needed to have a lot of rest before the final challenge. Claw on the other hand, thought that their team had a slight advantage of escaping Scorpion Island because they would be able to communicate more than Sting with their small number of players, as well as thinking Sting did not work well together. At the Island Fire, J.K. and Joel told the teams that there were no more chances to steal players, and that the final teams were locked in. The final captains were voted by the teams themselves. Olivia was the captain for Sting and Sammy was the captain for Claw. = Day 15 (Episodes 29 and 30) = * Torrent of Terror - The teams must pull ropes attached to heavy objects to the top of a mud hill while floods of ice-cold water and large rocks get in their way. The team that gets all the ropes to the top of the hill gets a time advantage. The teams must then pull all of the heavy objects to the top of the hill with the ropes. The teams must then go to the beach and use the heavy objects to build rafts using diagrams before paddling out to a pontoon 100 meters away and hitting a detonator. The team that hits the detonator first wins. * Challenge - Alex Y, Olivia, Cameron, Anna, Lachlan, Cai, Jack, Oliver, Lizzie and Amy from Sting vs Sammy, Tara, Jake, Ayla, Livvi and Alex T from Claw * Reward - Escape from Scorpion Island. Because of her leg injury, Livvi from Claw would not be able to take part in the first round of Torrent of Terror, so one rope was removed from the eight ropes Claw had to move up. In the first round, both teams were fighting against the water being splashed at them as they pulled their ropes up. Claw had the first rope up to the top, and Sting's Lachlan and Alex Y helped each other bringing Sting's first rope, before a flood came sliding them down. Tara from Claw found an easier way to pull the ropes up, going by the side of the mountain avoiding the floods for her team. Claw was leading but Sting was not far behind. Both teams had massive tumbles sliding down the mountain to pull their next ropes. Soon, some large rocks came rolling towards the teams. A rock smacked straight into Jack's face from Sting. Everyone was very tired but kept moving. When both teams had five ropes up the hill, a massive flood came and pushed some of Sting's members into a huge pile. Claw took the lead again and with their strength, pulled their 7th rope to the top making them win the first round. Sting kept on going, because Claw had got a time advantage the longer Sting took to finish, and used Claw's method of going up the side of the hill. Sting finally got all their eight ropes to the top of the hill, with Claw getting a 59-second advantage from them for the next round. In the next phase of the challenge, the teams were hauling the ropes to pull their raft equipment up the hill. Both teams were working on a pulling rhythm, but with Sting's larger numbers, they were much faster than Claw and got their raft equipment up first. Sting also managed to decrease the time advantage to 31 seconds. In the last stage, Claw tried to make the most of the time advantage as they assembled their raft, but there was no communication. Sting were then able to start. They ended up having arguments with each other as captain Olivia was shouting the orders, partially at Lizzie. Claw soon started work on their sail with Sting shortly following. Then, both teams had finished their rafts at the same time, but with wind approaching, they were forced to take down their masts. The teams were almost neck and neck, but with Claw's chanting and paddling, they were slightly ahead, while Sting had no communication, and no one was paddling in time. Claw kept working together, until they got to the pontoon with captain Sammy pushing the detonator claiming victory. Team Claw had escaped from Scorpion Island. A luxurious boat then came to take Claw home. Sting went back to the beach and watched in disappointment. They said they didn't have good teamwork and were disappointed with themselves. Meanwhile, as the boat was taking Claw home, they were giving the chance to phone their parents.  Facts  * Jake, Sammy, Olivia and Oliver were the favourites by the judges. * In the first episode, Sammy, Jake and Tara are introduced as Team Sting and Alex, Olivia and Cameron as Team Claw. However, this was a mistake as at all times except this, Sammy, Jake and Tara were in Team Claw and Alex Y, Olivia and Cameron were in Team Sting. * Sammy and Olivia were both the first and last captains of the teams. * This was the only series in which the entire composition of the teams was not random and where Sting and Claw had been started. This was necessary to allow teams to win players. * Every time that Cai played the Limbo Challenge, he was in the winning team and was nominated to be released from Limbo. He was first nominated twice by Claw (One False Move and Fearfall), in Above and Beyond he was won by Sting * Anna, Ayla and Lachlan escaped from Limbo in their first attempt. * Anna had the shortest time in Limbo with only two days while Alex T and Livvy spent the most time in Limbo with twelve days. * Alex Y is the only original adventurer to have been in Limbo. * Lachlan is the only Power Player to be a member of Sting. * In the Crush Rush, it is revealed that Olivia is \\"Mama Sting\\". * In many scenes, especially the first episode, spoilers were shown around such as which members were going to be on Sting or Claw, parts of the challenge and even the winning team was shown. * In one scene in the first episode, a group hug was done. This scene was shown only once and not seen since. The people who were involved in this group hug were members from both Sting and Claw. Cai, Cameron, Ayla, Anna, Jake, Ollie, Lizzie, Amy, Lachlan, Sammy and Tara can be seen. * Jack from Sting expressed his early desire to join Claw but was evenly happy to join Sting. * Jake from Claw was said to be a traitor on his team but he denied this strongly that he really was having a hard time with the challenge because he was scared of heights. Some of his team players did not realize this. * The third Survival Challenge is the first Survival Challenge that the Limbo Captives had received a Forfeit in. * Three challenges in this series were similar to challenges in Series 1. Pedal of Peril is similar to Bike Lane, Fearfall is like Colourfall and Torrent of Terror is like Landslide. * On screens, Livvy is shown as \\"Livvy\\". However, her helmet says \\"Livvi\\". It is unknown if it is a typo despite her actual name is Olivia. * On screens, Oliver is shown as \\"Oliver\\". However, his helmet says \\"Ollie\\" and when selected as captain at the Island Fire, it too said \\"Ollie\\". This is because his nickname is Ollie. * In the Stone of Selection for The Last Gasp, Ollie was marked for the blue team and Alex T was marked for the white team. In the challenge, their colours were swapped. * At the Stone of Selection for Tower of Strength, Ollie was marked white and since Alex T was taking the place of Livvy, he should've been blue but in the challenge, it was swapped again like The Last Gasp. * Every time a Power Player used their Power, their team won, except Alex T who used Freeze in Vertigo but despite this Claw lost that challenge. * Both teams had the most players at one stage. * In the challenge, The Crush Rush, Lizzy from Sting, who was in Claw beforehand, was wearing a black helmet for reasons unknown even though she wore an orange helmet (being the correct one for Sting) in Vertigo and Torrent of Terror. * Because of her leg injury, Livvy is the only adventurer to not wear a wetsuit in Torrent of Terror. * Lizzie and Amie, who Sting stole from Claw after winning the challenge Rollin Thunder, wear both the Claw and Sting necklaces at the same time. * Lizzie expressed her desire to go to Claw again after being captivated by the island but it wasn't able to be granted. She then tells us that her heart is still in Claw. * In Sting's inauguration of Amie and Lizzy, Amie's eyes can be seen watering as if she still wants to be in Claw or maybe because she let her former team down in Tower of Strength. She felt very sad but got through it in the end. * Jack is the only member not to become captain for any challenge. * Amie is the only member to become a captain on both Claw and Sting. * Even though Sting had more members, Claw had the most Power Players. * Having the fewest players to win would have made the raft lighter and easier to manage for team claw. However, Sting having more people on their raft would have a lot more power. But it was due to Claw's teamwork and Sting's lack of teamwork and not the number of players that caused Claw to win. * At the beginning of Rollin Thunder, it revealed that Livvy's injury was a 13 cm splinter stuck in her leg. This was caused while not filming, presumably between Stretched to the Limit and Reckless Rally. * Whenever Anna was captain of Sting, she always chose Cameron and her team loses the challenge. * The first rounds for The Crush Rush, Vertigo and Torrent of Terror are the only challenges for Sting and Claw to take part in instead of Limbo Captives. * Decks of Doom, The Last Gasp, Reckless Rally and The Crush Rush were also reused and slightly modified in Series 3 being named Triple Decker, Collision Course, Wheelspin and The Boulderizer respectively. * Before Jack had joined Sting, he had played in every challenge except for Above and Beyond and The Last Gasp * When Oliver was in Limbo, he participated in every Limbo Challenge except for Decks of Doom. * Jake was the sole male on Claw until day 7 when Claw won Oliver. On day 9, when Oliver went back to Limbo, Jake became the sole male again until day 12 when Claw won Alex T. * Alex T is the only male Limbo captive to have escaped. * This marks the only time that a team with more than 5 members have escaped; in Claw's case 6. * The Limbo captives only received a forfeit 3 times during the Survival Challenges. * In Series 3, the Limbo Challenge and Ultimate Jeopardy became The Eliminator and Double Jeopardy, respectively. * Alex T has only been stung blue once at the Stone of Selection. * Only the female adventurers from Australia (Tara and Ayla) have escaped.

The wind farm includes 132 Gamesa G80 wind turbines each with a two megawatt (MW) capacity along 12 miles of the Allegheny Front. Construction of the wind farm began in 2006 and the project is now fully operational, generating up to 264 MW of electricity for the mid- Atlantic power grid.Dominion & Shell Complete 264-MW Mount Storm Wind Project Nedpower Mount Storm, LLC is a joint venture between Shell and Dominion Resources, founded in 2007., \\"Company Overview of Nedpower Mount Storm, LLC\\",\\"Bloomberg Businessweek\\" History Plans for the farm were first announced in 2001, when U.S. Wind Force filed for a permit with the West Virginia Public Service Commission to build a 166 turbine wind farm, which would have been the largest wind farm east of the Mississippi River. The project's backers hoped that the first turbines would be operational by late 2002 with the rest of the facility coming online in 2003, but opponents quickly raised objections, arguing that the project would threaten birds and diminish home values in the surrounding area. In May 2002, the Public Service Commission approved U.S. Wind Force's permit application without any significant opposition. The company also reached an agreement with the AFL-CIO to use union labor in the construction of the facility. At the hearings for the permit, speakers in favor of the project included Walt Helmick, a member of the West Virginia Senate, Jeff Barger, the County Commissioner of Grant County, and Steve White a union leader. A study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that the project posed little danger to local birds, clearing the way for construction.

He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, in which he was wounded twice. After the war, Walcutt was warden of the Ohio State Penitentiary and also was active in civic affairs in Ohio, and his death was attributed to his wounds from the Civil War. Early life and career Charles Carroll Walcutt was born in 1838 in the city of Columbus. He was a son of John M. Walcutt, a chair maker, and Mariel Broderick, and had three sisters, one of whom was named Virginia. Walcutt's maternal grandmother was also a first cousin of Davy Crockett. Both his father (War of 1812) and grandfather (American Revolution) had served the United States in combat.Warner, p. 534. Walcutt received his initial education in the Columbus-area schools, and then in 1854 entered the Kentucky Military Institute in Lyndon, Kentucky. He graduated in June 1858, intending to become a civil engineer, and he was elected Franklin County's surveyor the following year. Walcutt married Phebe Neill in 1860. She was born in Belfast, Ireland, and was a daughter of Hugh Neill, who had served as an officer in the British Army. The couple would have three children together, sons named J. Macy, Sherman, and Charles Carroll Jr., who later would serve in the 8th U.S. Cavalry as regimental quartermaster. Civil War service When the American Civil War began in 1861, Walcutt chose to follow his home state and the Union cause. On April 15 he organized a company of soldiers in Columbus, was appointed its captain on April 17, and went into camp with them the next day. However, Ohio's quota had already been met and Walcutt's company was rejected for Federal use. That June he was appointed a major in the state forces and served on the staff of Ohio Militia Brig. Gen. Charles W. Hill in what is now West Virginia. Walcutt as a Union colonel That fall Walcutt helped raise and train the 46th Ohio Infantry. He was appointed to the Union Army as a major in that regiment on October 1, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 30, 1862.Eicher(2), p. 548. Walcutt reported to Paducah, Kentucky, for duty that February, and in March he went with the army up the Tennessee River. The 46th Ohio saw its first combat on April 6 during the Battle of Shiloh. In this fight Walcutt was hit in his left shoulder, and the bullet would remain there for the rest of his life.Warner, p. 535. Walcutt was promoted to colonel on October 16, 1862, and given command of the 46th Ohio. He led his regiment in the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi from December 1862 until July 1863. During the campaign, Walcutt fought in the Union victory at the Battle of Jackson on May 14. He then fought with distinction in the Battle of Missionary Ridge at Chattanooga, Tennessee, on November 23-25\\\\. When Brig. Gen. John M. Corse was seriously wounded, command of his brigade fell to Walcutt, who led it and held \\"against repeated charges by superior numbers.\\" After the fight his overall commander, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, praised Walcutt's efforts in his official report and recommended a promotion. In the report Sherman stated: The entire brigade re-enlisted on January 5, 1864, an action that highly pleased Walcutt. After leaving Chattanooga, he continued to lead the brigade and fought in the Atlanta Campaign that summer. Walcutt participated in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27, and the Battle of Atlanta on July 22. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on July 30. Walcutt's home town newspaper gave this version of his efforts around Atlanta in his obituary: Maj. Gen. Walcutt (seated, 2nd from right) and his staff near the end of the American Civil War Walcutt then participated in the March to the Sea in November and December 1864. He again fought with distinction at the Battle of Griswoldville on November 22, and was again wounded. His brigade of about 1,500 men moved to support Union cavalry and held a defensive position at Duncan's Farm against repeated attacks by ill-trained Confederate Georgia Militia. Combined Union losses in the fight were less than 100, including Walcutt, while the Confederates lost about 51 killed, 472 wounded, and around 600 missing or captured.Eicher(1), p. 766. Walcutt was wounded early in the action, and command of the brigade fell to Col. Robert F. Catterson of the 97th Regiment Indiana Infantry. Sherman would again praise him in his report, and Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard said of him \\"there is not a braver or better officer.\\" He was hit in his right leg by a shell fragment, and would be out of action for months. On April 4, 1865, Walcutt was recovered enough to command the 1st division of the XIV Corps, leading it in the grand review in Washington, D.C., until June 12. After hostilities ended he led his command to Louisville, Kentucky, where it was mustered out of the volunteer service that August. Walcutt served in the western department until he was mustered out of the Union Army on January 15, 1866. For his actions at Griswoldville, President of the United States Andrew Johnson appointed Walcutt to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers,Reported in the United States Service Magazine New York:1865 in July, 1865, p. 76. to rank from March 13, 1865, and nominated him for commissioning to that grade on January 18, 1866, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher (2), 2001, p. 715. Postbellum career Courtyard of the former Ohio Penitentiary After the war Walcutt went home, where he was warden of the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus in 1866. On July 28 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 10th U.S. Cavalry, and proceeded to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to report for duty. He resigned on December 1, 1866, \\"unwilling to endure army life in time of peace.\\" Walcutt returned to Ohio and again worked as a warden until 1869. Walcutt was also active in politics in Ohio, and was one of Ulysses S. Grant's electors in 1868. In May he was appointed the U.S. Internal Revenue Service collector for the 7th district of Ohio by President Grant, which he held until July 1, 1883. In 1872 Walcutt was elected to the Columbus board of education, with seven years as its president, until April 1, 1894. Also in 1872 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In April 1883 he was elected mayor of Columbus, elected to a second term, retired in April 1887 and succeeded by Philip H. Bruck. His wife Phebe died the following year. In 1898 Walcutt was in Omaha, Nebraska, heading back to Ohio after visiting Mexico with his sister Virginia \\"for his health.\\" There his condition worsened, and he stayed in Omaha for about six weeks. Ten days before his death doctors amputated one of his limbs.Text of Walcutt's obituaries states: \\"...the depleted physical condition of the old warrior... could not rally from the shock attending the amputation of his limb.\\" as well as \\"It is supposed to have been made necessary from an old wound and the warm climate in Mexico.\\" His body was brought back to Ohio and was buried in Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus.

Tiv Ta'am is Israel's largest producer and supplier of non-kosher meat,Gaydamak acquires non-kosher supermarket chain Ynetnews, 10 June 2007 and is also noted for most of its branches staying open during the Jewish Sabbath and on Jewish holidays (except Yom Kippur). There are 32 Tiv Ta'am supermarkets throughout Israel, and the company is also involved in food processing and telecommunications.TLV:TTAM Google Finance, accessed 12 December 2008 A special offer on pork chops (50 shekels for 2 kg) in the Beer-Sheva Tiv Ta'am branch. History Tiv Ta'am was founded by Kobi Tribitch and Tzachi Lipka in 1990. The supermarket is today a national chain. In addition to the supermarkets throughout Israel, Tiv Ta'am is also involved in food processing and production, which include meat processing, hot dogs, chicken, fish, seafood, dried fruits, cheeses and wine, and telecommunication, which includes the import, market, and distribution of telecommunication switchboards. However, in 2007, Tiv Ta'am sold its holding in the telecommunication satellite company Satcom Ltd., and in September 2008 Tiv Ta'am sold its holdings in Tadiran Telecom. =Potential sale= In June 2007 a lot of news was made and uproar among certain segments of the Israeli public,Gaydamak, Tiv Ta'am deal falls through Ynetnews, 18 June 2007 when Arcadi Gaydamak, Israeli businessman, made an offer to purchase the company and making a public commitment to turn the supermarket kosher and stop selling pork.Tiv Taam, kosher? Gaydamak says yes The Jerusalem Post, 11 June 2007 He also said that he would make Mizra, the factory which produces pork products for Tiv Ta'am, supply chicken instead of pork. A few days later, the deal collapsed, when it became apparent that it was infeasible to turn the supermarket kosher in addition that Kobi Tribitch, refused to knock off $10 million from the purchase price. It was infeasible to turn it kosher because Mizra had a contract with Tiv Ta'am that allowed it to sell pork, and some analysts believed Gaydamak realized most of Tiv Ta'am's customers shop there because it is not kosher. =Controversy= Controversy was created in 2006 when the Israeli investigative affairs show Kolbotek (similar to the American program 60 Minutes) alleged that Tiv Ta'am was selling meat after its expiration date. In 2007, Kolbotek showed video of cats roaming one of Tiv Ta'am's storerooms and eating food, prompting Tiv Ta'am to run a $500,000 advertising campaign to improve its image.Tiv Taam pours $500,000 into spicing up its image Haaretz, 11 October 2007 Tiv Ta'am has been criticized by ultra- Orthodox Jews for selling non-kosher products such as pork, with many boycotting the chain.

In 1998, he finished at AKI. From 2004 to 2008 he lived and worked in Munich, Germany, then moved Hamburg, where he achieved the Philipp Otto Runge Scholarship for one year.Bo Christian Larsson Received Award from The Philipp Otto Runge Foundation , Art Knowledge News, accessed 2010-05-19 Larsson lives and works in √Ñlvkarhed, Sweden and Berlin, Germany.

No big deal. You put on the wig and you are a different person. This has always fascinated me. I have the wig in front of my eyes. I turn it around, so I can't see anything. This is a very important point in my performances, that I blind myself and have to take a look inside. I become a different person and disappear in this role.\\" (Interview on Bavarian Radio, 24.06.2008) :Stephanie Rosenthal, curator: \\"Rites of passage are specifically important in Larsson's work. This phase stands for ‚Äûalready-loosening\\" of the old condition and \\"not-yet-arrived\\" in a new condition. In this \\"twilight- zone\\" there are the most possibilities to new thoughts. It seems as if Larsson wants to remain there. He becomes a border crosser, an intermediate being, passing through a permanent process of transformation.\\" (in: Favoriten 08.

He also opposes the occult (magic, witchcraft, divination and necromancy) and homosexuality; and cares for victims of paedophilia and sexual abuse. Male was born on 17 August 1962, and converted to Christianity on 31 October 1987. In 1988 he became one of the ministers of a church, Holy Church of Christ, \\"New Chapter\\" renamed The Synagogue Church of All Nations, whose leaders and members are followers of John Obiri Yeboah, a Ghanain-born former Catholic priest who came to Uganda. Male left that church in 1992, denouncing it as a cult.Pastors robbing in Jesus' name?, The Weekly Observer, 5 April 2007 In 1993 Male was arrested as a result of his accusations against the church, but he was later released and the case was withdrawn.Desecration of my kingdom , New Vision, 18 May 2003. Retrieved 18 October 2010. Male then began an evangelistic ministry to help people who had suffered abuse from cults or occult groups.Arising for Christ at Cephas Ministries website In 1999 he founded Arising for Christ (ARCH), an Christian organisation whose leadership wants to restore \\"the sanctity of Christ and to rid the Church of fake and selfish people who carry themselves as pastors to con the desperate and unsuspecting public.\\" The organisation claimed in January 2008 to have compiled a list of 300 believers who accuse born-again pastors of extortion, fraud, sex slavery and other crimes. In an interview with the Financial Times, Male claimed to be following Martin Luther who centuries before had railed against vice, luxury and corruption among his fellow clergy. He compares the manipulation of sick people, into paying for prayers, to the sale of indulgences: > \\"The man who stood against the evil in the church was Martin Luther, because > he was against the selling of worthless objects which were to save you from > hell. The moment he started the Protestant movement, it gave hope that when > something is wrong, there is the possibility of setting it right.\\" Campaigns and prominent casework Frances Adroa, an HIV / AIDS patient, in July 2005 was coerced to surrender her car to the leaders of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God in Kampala in return for promises to heal her of AIDS during the church's Mount Sinai Campaign. She was not cured. During deterioration of her health condition, she demanded back her car. The church leaders, Bishop Gilson Costa and Pastor Gerald Nkayi claimed 2 million Ugandan shillings (over US$1,200), allegedly for its repairs, which she did not have. On 17 March 2007, she heard Pastor Male on the radio and later called him for an appointment to tell him how she had lost her car. When he confronted the church leaders, they eventually returned it in its damaged condition. When Male publicised the car return in newspapers and other media in 2007, the leaders sued him and Adroa for defamation. The libel claim failed in 2010, and both sides were left to bear their own costs. Adroa had counterclaimed for repairs to the car, but this also failed, as the magistrate did not want to create a precedent for donors to ask for their gifts back if prayers were not fulfilled.Uganda: Church Loses Libel Case, New Vision, 22 June 2010. Cited at AllAfrica.com. Retrieved 18 October 2010. Solomon Male campaigns for greater financial accountability in churches. He says that the practice of giving land, cars or household goods to pastors in exchange for blessings, known as \\"sowing seeds of faith\\", is widespread in Uganda, and is generally not included in the churches' accounts. He reports that such donations are not even reported to boards or auditors, but are treated as the personal income of the pastors. Following up his report, the newspaper Sunday Vision checked the accounts of twelve Pentecostal churches, some of which were known for the practice; none declared any income from \\"sowing\\", and despite receiving billions of shillings, only Kampala Pentecostal Church and Redeemed Church had their accounts professionally audited.Churches declare billions, Sunday Vision, 18 August 2007.

After failing to secure sanctioning of the charges, they were released. They never made the purported additional statements. On 3 October 2012, six people were fined sh1m each and ordered to do 100 hours of community service after being convicted of conspiring to destroy Pastor Robert Kayanja's name and profession. All six convictions are currently under appeal. In 2013, he opposed the divorce and remarriage of Bishop David Kiganda, branding it to be contrary to Biblical teaching. Responses from others Responding to such allegations, Pentecostal pastor Bishop David Kiganda, Kampala district chairman of the National Fellowship of Born Again Churches, says that only a minority of Pentecostal pastors are involved in questionable activities. He and the National Fellowship ran a program called Operation Clean the House to exclude dishonest preachers from the denomination, and declared 15 of their fellow churches to be \\"cults.\\" The National Fellowship publicly disowned Male in 2006.

Early life Mitrevski was born in 1912 in the Kastorian village of ƒåuka (Chuka), then in the Ottoman Empire. Involvement with the National Liberation Front In 1943 Mitrevski joined the Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front until it was disbanded in 1944. On April 23, 1945 he founded the Narodno Osloboditelen Front or National Liberation Front (NOF) along with Mihajlo Keramitƒçiev, Georgi Urdov, Atanas Korove≈°ov, Pavle Rakovski and Minƒço Fotev. He soon became the representative of NOF to the Greek Communist Party (KKE) and Democratic Army of Greece. On September 13, 1946, Mitrevski wrote a letter in which he stated \\"We did not leave a single issue unresolved or in the dark\\" in regards to the Macedonian issue and the existence of the National Liberation Front.EM, 3, no.171, pp.380-83, Mitrovski, Report, September 13, 1946 By this time Mitrevski had entered talks with Markos Vafiadis regarding the complete merger of the Communist Party and the National Liberation Front. This was achieved but the National Liberation Front remained a semi-autonomous entity within the KKE. Mitrevski was a staunch supporter of the NOF and criticised the regional leadership of the KKE. Eventually a rift occurred between Mitrevski and Mihajlo Keramitƒçiev and many factions of the National Liberation Front were divided. This was in turn over the dismissal of NOF leaders such as Vangel Ajanovski-Oƒçe and Lambro Colakov from the Executive Council by General Ioannidis. In turn this matter was taken to the Politburo of the party on February 20‚Äì21, 1948 where Mitrevski and the leader of the \\"Anti-Fascist Women's Front\\" (), Vera Nikolova, publicly criticised each other. As it was obvious that the party was in serious internal strife, Mitrevski proposed that Stavros Kochopoulos become leader of the party rather than Mihajlo Keramitƒçiev, who had the support of rival factions. Soon mistrust and suspicion grew about Mitrevski's role in NOF and the Communist Party. Many claimed that he was \\"motivated solely by his own personal ambitions\\". He attended the general meeting of the politburo on July 10 which adopted a motion denouncing the NOF and indirectly the Macedonian contribution to the war effort; Mitrevski refuted these claims but to no avail. The fits which had occurred between him and Keramitƒçiev was seen as potentially fatal to the party and he was removed as leader of NOF on August 8, 1948. Stavros Kochopoulos officially became president while Vangel Kojƒçev was made secretary. By December, however, it had been decided by Nikos Zachariadis that the membership of the secretariat should be expanded and Mitrevski was reinstated.Rossos, A: Incompatible Allies: Greek Communism and Macedonian Nationalism in the Civil War in Greece, 1943 - 1949 On the initiative of Zachariadis, Mitrevski was reinstated as President of the National Liberation Front on April 1, 1949. Minister in the Provisional Government Four days after his reinstatement as President of the National Liberation Front on April 5, 1949, Paskal Mitrevski was appointed as the Minister for Food in the Provisional Government along with Krste Kaƒçev who was appointed as the Director of National Minorities in the Ministry of the Interior.Woodhouse, C.M: The Struggle for Greece, 1941-1949 page 268. C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2002 By mid 1949 only one of the three major factions in the NOF was in support of Mitrevski. After the collapse of the Democratic Army of Greece, Mitrevski fled to Bureli, Albania. He was arrested on October 3, 1948 on accusations that he was an \\"agent of Tito\\".

Controversy  In 2018, concerns were raised over BISS, a school affiliated with ISS in Beijing, where it was reported that faculty and staff at BISS took industrial action on the school over unpaid wages. Over 30 parents reportedly turned up on the school campus demanding answers for the disruption and the management of the school. Consequently, the Beijing government took action to bail out the troubled school and controversy sparked within the Singapore ISS community.

It should not be confused with the French appointment of \\"armed forces commissary\\" (commissaire des arm√©es) which is an administrative military position. Overview Every commune with a population of more than 30,000-50,000 has a commissaire in charge of its detachment of the National Police, and larger communes have more than one (the Prefecture of Police of Paris has well over one hundred). A commissaire has both an administrative role and an investigative role. In most circumstances, a commissaire is responsible for leading a police station. Most officers join directly at the rank of commissaire. All are university graduates, usually in law, and have completed a further training course. It is also possible for junior officers to be promoted to the rank (something which was virtually impossible until relatively recently). A commissaire may be promoted to commissaire divisionnaire (a rank which existed in the Paris Police and the Mobile Brigades from the early 20th century), and thence to the higher ranks of the service. The police station which serves as an ordinary commissaire's headquarters and the area for which they are responsible is a commissariat, a term which can also refer to the body of commissaires as a whole.  Subdivisions of the status  There are 8 ranks of officer who are commissaires. The first four are ranks to which one is promoted, whilst the latter four are nominations by the government, including the Director General of Police. In Paris, a slightly different higher rank structure applies, based on the civilian administrative system and not the armed-forces derived Police system. File:Galons Commissaires.svgThe 4 ranks of commissaire, including the Commissaire Principal, scrapped in 2006. File:Galons emploi direction.svgThe 4 tiers of directors. They are not ranks but rather Commissaires G√©n√©raux who are named at the discretion of the government to these roles.  Rank equivalence  There is no direct equivalent grade in a British-style police system. The term commissioner is an inaccurate literal translation. A newly- graduated commissaire may often be found in charge of a police station, so to this end, the grade is equivalent to a British superintendent, although the latter may also be more comparable to a Commandant de Police √† l'Emploi Fonctionnel . The problem becomes more complicated when discussing commissaires divisionnaires and g√©n√©raux, as the grade equivalence is less clear. A commissaire g√©n√©ral may be a regional head of the Police Judiciaire (CID), for instance. In London, this would be a role fulfilled by an assistant commissioner. However, this officer is likely to be more akin in rank to a deputy assistant commissioner. The rank of a commissaire divisionnaire is best described as equivalent to a deputy assistant commissioner or commander. A commissaire principal, when it was in existence, would be equivalent to a chief superintendent. The highest four ranks do not have any form of equivalence, as the Director-General and his deputies are in charge of the whole of France's policing. It is important to note that commissaires, as commissioners, are commissioned by the government to undertake civil and administrative duties as well as some quasi-judicial roles. History Insignia of a commissaire principal, which was abolished in 2006 The commissaires originated in Paris as the 48 commissaires enqu√™teurs- examinateurs of the Grand Ch√¢telet. > Long before 1667, they had served as all-purpose agents of the Ch√¢telet in > the various quarters of Paris. But by choice and economic compulsion, they > had increasingly forsaken their role of watchdogs of public security and had > become somewhat discredited fee-grabbers, mainly concerned with such matters > as imposing seals on the property of the deceased, taking legal inventories, > serving summonses, and imposing a wide variety of fines on which they > collected a lucrative percentage.L√©on Bernard, The Emerging City: Paris in > the Age of Louis XIV (Duke University Press, 1970), p. 44. The first Lieutenant General of Police of Paris, Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, tried to reform the commissaires, persuading the king to increase salaries and retirement benefits and restore honors formerly attached to the office in the hopes of weaning them off the corrupting system of fees, but it was \\"a losing battle. In 1699 the old fee system was restored in the manner long demanded by the commissaires.\\" > Whatever the shortcomings of the forty-eight commissaires, they remained the > backbone of public order in Paris. Several kinds of armed, uniformed > patrolmen theoretically circulated around the streets of Paris ... but in > time of trouble the commissaire's house (practically all seventeenth-century > officials did their work from their residences) loomed as large as > Gibraltar. Ordinarily, a criminal case began with someone knocking on the > door of the nearest commissaire and lodging a complaint against a fellow > citizen. The commissaire's address was well known to residents of his > quartier, and he was supposed to be available day and night to hear > grievances and settle disputes. ... Each commissaire was assigned several > sergents or huissiers to assist him in carrying out his civil duties ‚Äî the > only duties most commissaires really cared about, since they carried the > most lucrative fees.Bernard, The Emerging City, pp. 45-46. In the mid-eighteenth century, the commissaires \\"generally enjoyed the confidence of the people.\\"David Garrioch, The Making of Revolutionary Paris (University of California Press, 2002: ), p. 139. Each of them was based in a particular area of the city and thus knew and was known to the local citizens; they were generally \\"well educated, usually with legal training, and their job was not only to keep order but also to protect public health and safety... The commissaires also played an important role as local notables. They convened meetings of inhabitants to elect people to look after the streetlights. They responded to public complaints about antisocial behavior...\\" They \\"returned to their owners goods that had been pawned at usurious rates of interest\\" and witnessed statements and complaints. \\"All of these matters gave the commissaire a very particular relationship with the public. He was, in a sense, at their service.\\"Garrioch, The Making of Revolutionary Paris, pp. 139-40. The commissaires de police became the linchpin of France‚Äôs urban police system after the French Revolution. \\"By the early years of the Restoration of the monarchy, most towns with more than five thousand inhabitants, as well as smaller municipalities on important trade routes or near frontiers, had at least one CP.\\"Stacey Davis, \\"Uncovering the Lives of France‚Äôs Nineteenth-Century Police and Those They Watched,\\" H-Law (October, 2006). Before the creation of the National Police in 1941, every commune with a population of more than 5,000 had to have a commissaire by law, every commune with a population of more than 10,000 had to have two, and for every additional 10,000 people there had to be an additional commissaire. In a commune with more than one commissaire, the most senior, who acted as chief of police, was called the commissaire central. The Paris Prefecture of Police had one commissaire for each quartier, plus one for each of the larger suburban communes in the Department of the Seine; the smaller suburban communes were grouped together under commissaires. There were also additional commissaires commanding specialist units in the Judicial Police. The Paris commissaire began his professional life as a secr√©taire suppl√©ant (assistant secretary), from which he was promoted, usually after about eighteen months if there was a vacancy, to secr√©taire de police (secretary of police). Each commissaire was assisted by one of each of these officers. A secr√©taire had to pass an examination for promotion to commissaire.Ren√© Faralicq, The French Police from Within, Cassell: London, 1933 The Mobile Brigades of the S√ªret√©, formed in 1907, also used the rank of commissaire.

It has been considered Graham's most groundbreaking and consistent work and a defining record of the 20th century. It has also been a primary influence on some of the most popular musicians in Britain ranging from Bert Jansch to Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton. Background Graham's first album, The Guitar Player, was almost exclusively jazz based. He was also known for his collaborations with folksinger Shirley Collins, which had established his name in the purist folk communities in Britain. Most of the tracks on the album are a fusion of traditional western folk/blues and Middle-Eastern music. This synthesis of world sounds was inspired by Grahams frequent traveling across the Asian continent from the early 1950s onward. Graham also utilizes jazz progressions to re-innovate and contemporize traditional sounds, especially on the blues tracks of the album. For example, the opening track is a cover of \\"Leavin' Blues\\", written by Lead Belly, which is a straightforward blues in C. Graham's version uses the DADGAD guitar tuning, and he speeds up the tempo to give it a more 'rocking' sound. His cover is also infused with an exotic, middle eastern sound, accredited to both the tuning and the exotic musical scales he uses throughout the song. In 2002, a remastered CD version of the album was released in the UK. Reception In his Allmusic review, critic Richie Unterberger wrote \\"This was Graham's most groundbreaking and consistent album. More than his solo debut The Guitar Player (which was pretty jazzy) or his previous collaboration with folk singer Shirley Collins, Folk Roots, New Routes, this established his mixture of folk, jazz, blues, and Middle Eastern music, the use of a bassist and drummer also hinting at (though not quite reaching) folk-rock... If there is one aspect of the recording to criticize, it is, as was usually the case with Graham, the thin, colorless vocals. The guitar playing is the main attraction, though; it's so stellar that it makes the less impressive singing easy to overlook. Ten of the 16 songs were included on the compilation Folk Blues and All Points in Between, but Graham fans should get this anyway, as the level of material and musicianship is pretty high throughout most of the disc.\\" Track listing #\\"Leavin' Blues\\" (Lead Belly) #\\"Cocaine\\" (Reverend Gary Davis) #\\"Sally Free and Easy\\" (Cyril Tawney) #\\"Black Is the Colour of My True Love's Hair\\" (Traditional) #\\"Rock Me Baby\\" (Big Bill Broonzy) #\\"Seven Gypsies\\" (Traditional) #\\"Ballad of the Sad Young Men\\" (Fran Landesman, Tommy Wolf) #\\"Moanin'\\" (Bobby Timmons) #\\"Skillet (Good'n'greasy)\\" (Graham) #\\"Ain't Nobody's Business What I Do\\" (Porter Grainger, Everett Robbins) #\\"Maajun (A Taste of Tangier)\\" (Davy Graham) #\\"I Can't Keep from Cryin' Sometimes\\" (Blind Willie Johnson) #\\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" (Bob Dylan) #\\"My Babe\\" (Willie Dixon) #\\"Goin' Down Slow\\" (J.

The neighborhood name means in Finnish 'Tiny Felt Bay' (after the original name in Swedish, Lillhoplax, was phonetically but inaccurately translated into Huopalahti in Finnish), with a bay of the same name forming most of the neighborhood edge on its West side, surrounded by a large park. This bay extends out to the Gulf of Finland. Most of the housing in Pikku Huopalahti is residential apartment building, primarily built in the 1990s. Pikku Huopalahti is home to around 10.000 people. The terrace house is a landmark of the region and a good example of the architecture of Pikku Huopalahti As a neighborhood of Helsinki, Pikku Huopalahti finds itself as a Sui generis. Helsinki's subdivision system uniquely divides Pikku Huopalahti as belonging to 3 separate city districts. The southern part belongs to the Meilahti district and is numbered 1505. The eastern part belongs to the Ruskeasuo district and is numbered 1602 and the rest of Pikku Huopalahti belongs to the Haaga district and is numbered 2916. The headquarters of McDonald's Finland is located in Pikku Huopalahti on Paciuksenkatu, in a large cylindrical building designed by Heikkinen-Komonen architects. The final stop on Helsinki's 10 tram is also located in Pikku Huopalahti. The 4 tram travels on Paciuksenkatu to the south of Pikku Huopalahti on its way to Munkkiniemi but never actually enters the neighborhood. The University of Helsinki has its Department of Dentistry, Institute for Oral Health, Department of Public Health and Department of Forensic Medicine campus in the North East corner of Pikku Huopalahti. As of 2015 the university has decided to relocate its facilities, so the existing buildings will be torn down and the City of Helsinki has prepared an area plan draft to redevelop the area. The neighborhood is also known as having a 'Legoland' effect because the buildings, mostly constructed in the past 20 years, all prominently display basic geometric patterns such as circles, squares, and triangles on the residential housing. Also, the use of light pastel colors, mostly white, light blue, and turquoise, make Pikku Huopalahti a very distinct neighborhood compared to the other neighborhoods to the north and west that have more traditional housing stock from the 1940s and 1950s. The architecture and urban layout is said to reflect criticisms of modernism present in the \\"Oulu school\\" of architecture often associated with Reima and Raili Pietil√§. City districts partly forming and/or surrounding Pikku- Huopalahti are Meilahti, Munkkiniemi, Munkkivuori, Niemenm√§ki, Etel√§-Haaga and Ruskeasuo.

It is a free and open-source project distributed under the Apache license and runs on any JDK installation (1.5 or later). Click was initially created by Malcolm Edgar as the click.sourceforce.net project in 2003. The project then graduated to an Apache top-level project in November 2009 with Bob Schellink. The project was retired in May 2014. Overview The main design goals are simplicity, ease of use, performance and scalability. To achieve these goals Click leverages an intuitive page and component oriented design. Pages and components provide good encapsulation of web concepts and enables rapid application development. Click takes a pragmatic approach and expose few abstractions to learn and understand. The Java Servlet API is fully exposed to the developer which eases the upgrade path from an action based framework to a component based one. Pages and components are developed in Java while templates can be written in Velocity, FreeMarker or JSP. Components know how to draw themselves alleviating developers from maintaining redundant markup. A major difference between Click and other component oriented web frameworks is that Click is stateless by design, although stateful pages are supported. Competing frameworks There are a number of other component oriented frameworks available for Java such as JSF, Tapestry, WebObjects, Apache Wicket and Vaadin. Some developers prefer the more traditional action-based web frameworks including Apache Struts, Spring MVC, and Stripes.  Example  A Hello World Click application, with four files: ; hello-world.htm : The default template engine for Click is Velocity, the htm file will be similar to a normal, static HTML page. $message ; HelloWorld.java : The page model that will be bound to the template. package org.wikipedia.click; import org.apache.click.Page; public class HelloWorld extends Page { /*Constructor */ public HelloWorld() { // Add the value to the map (\\"message\\" = \\"$message\\") addModel(\\"message\\", \\"Hello World!\\"); } } ; click.xml : The heart of a Click application is the \`click.xml\` configuration file. This file specifies the application pages, headers, the format object and the applications mode. : Click is smart enough to figure out that the \`HelloWorld\` page class maps to the template \`hello-world.htm\`. We only have to inform Click of the package of the \`HelloWorld\` class, in this case \`org.wikipedia.click\`. We do that through the \`click.xml\` configuration file which allows Click to map \`hello-world.htm\` requests to the \`org.wikipedia.click.HelloWorld\` page class. : By default the \`ClickServlet\` will attempt to load the application configuration file using the path: \`/WEB- INF/click.xml\` ; web.xml : The servlet application definition.

According to the epic, when Ravana the king of asuras, kidnapped Sita wife of Lord Sri Rama and tried to take her to his kingdom Lanka on his Pushpaka Vimana, Jatayu; the huge bird opposed Ravana and it resulted in a battle between them. In the war Ravana slit Jatayu's one wing and escaped to Lanka with Sita. With a fatal wound, Jatayu falls on top of a big rock. Later Rama & Lakshmana found the wounded Jatayu and he passed the message and died on the laps of Rama. Hence, the rock got the name Jadayupara. Jatayu is the son of Aru·πáa and nephew of Garuda who has the form of a vulture. Jadayu Para is well known as a tourist destination and a place of pilgrimage.

History Full View of Vedanthangal bird sanctuary. Vedanthangal Landscape In a world of their own, Vedanthankal The Vedanthangal lake bird sanctuary has a tradition of the people actively protecting birds coming to the area since time immemorial. The local people understood the relationship between birds and the productivity of their crops even before the concept of wildlife conservation came into vogue. They knew that the bird droppings in the water created guano which acted as fertilizer. Towards the end of the 18th century local villagers complained to the collector of Chengalpet Lionel Palace, about the British soldiers shooting the birds. They demanded and obtained a 'Cowle' from the collector (Mr Place, Collector of Chingleput 1796-1798) to protect the birds. In 1936 the collector officially recognized the lake as a sanctuary. In 1962 it was given the legal status of reserved forest under the Madras Forest Act. Several accounts of the sanctuary were published in the mid-19th century. In 1936, the park was notified as a sanctuary, and in 1962, the Madras Forest Act legally accorded the status of a reserve forest to Vedanthangal. Ten years later, the place was declared as a wildlife sanctuary. In the government order dated 8 July 1988, the area was declared as 'Vedanthangal Lake Bird Sanctuary', under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. In 1967, a rest house was constructed for the convenience of visiting inspecting officers and tourists. The area had a compact grove of more than 500 Barringtonia trees earlier.

On the left the arch that leads to Villa Mellini, now an observatory. Oil painting by Salomon Corrodi, 1876 Balduina is an urban area that belongs to the Municipio XIX of the comune of Rome, and to the fourteenth borough of the city, (Q.XIV, called Trionfale). Situated at 139 metres above sea level on the southern side of Monte Mario, Balduina is the highest part of Rome. The population is 42,000. Geography The area of Balduina is marked on the southern side by the green \\"cliffs\\" of the hill forming a natural entrance just at the corner of Via Antonio Labriola and Via Gualtiero Serafino through Viale delle Medaglie d‚ÄôOro in a place known at the beginning of the 20th century as Dogana della Balduina (the customs house of Balduina); It is bounded to the west by the FL3 railway that runs from Rome to Cesano and Viterbo, a boundary overtaken by some housing in the Monte Ciocci area, here facing the Valle Aurelia, known as \\"Valle dell‚ÄôInferno\\"Valle dell‚ÄôInferno is so called from the Latin word ‚Äúinferius‚Äô, i.e.: ‚Äúplaced lower‚Äù. Balduina is bounded to the north by some convents and villas on the Via Trionfale, a historic road that leads north towards Via Cassia. Finally, to east the neighbourhood is framed by the Via Trionfale itself, which runs down from Villa Stuart to Borghetto S. Lazzaro and is the boundary with Prati di Castello. Until the beginning of the twentieth century \\"Balduina\\" and \\"Monte Mario\\" were used interchangeably and the neighbourhood was surrounded by open fields with no specific name. Subsequently, the name \\"Monte Mario\\" slowly \\"moved\\" (in an urban sense) towards the areas of S. Onofrio and Case Nostre, marking these areas on the plateau where today stands the railway station of the same name.  History  Balduina's north-eastern ridge seen from Prati di Castello's side of the Tiber. Painting by Ettore Roesler Franz (Roma, 1845-1907) Balduina is named after Baldovino del Monte, brother of Pope Julius III del Monte (1550‚Äì1555) and owner of those lands on the southern part of Monte Mario. The modern neighbourhood started around 1909 with some elegant villas built on Viale delle Medaglie d‚ÄôOro and Viale Tito Livio. A much bigger expansion started just after World War II with the typical Roman Palazzine, four or five-storey buildings, split in some apartments, nine as a base. Districts Balduina is divided into four districts: * the central part of Balduina, the core of the neighbourhood, is centred on Piazza Balduina; * Belsito, to the north, is marked by Piazzale delle Medaglie D'Oro and the green area of Parco della Vittoria, Villa Stuart and the green areas around the Waldorf Astoria Rome Cavalieri; *Columbus, near Ges√π Divino Maestro church. * Monte Ciocci, named after the Casale Ciocci mansion (a work by Baldassarre Peruzzi), faces the Vatican hill and is the home of the old brickworks which were created to provide building materials for Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica.

Serbia and Albania are both official candidate countries for EU accession. However, despite this relationship, the two countries have, in general, had a very tense confrontation having to do with the historical massacres of Albanians in Kosovo by the Serbian military.  History  = Ottoman period = In the late Ottoman period, Serbian diplomat Ilija Gara≈°anin contacted the abbot of Mirdita, Msgr. Gasper Krasniqi, with the goal of acquiring the Albanian Catholic element as the alleged solution to the \\"Eastern Question\\". However, their goals were different. While Gara≈°anin considered those contacts as means for the realization of a Serbian exit to the Adriatic Sea, Krasniqi made effort to help Serbia to organize a revolution of the Albanian Catholic community, primarily Mirdita, against the Turks, for the political freedom and independence of Albania. = Balkan Wars = At the beginning of Balkan Wars, one of the important strategic goals of Serbian politics was to acquire a corridor to the Adriatic Sea, as such, its intention had been to share a common border with its ally the Kingdom of Greece thus denying the Albanian nation independent status.Dimitrije Bogdanoviƒá: Knjiga o KosovuAleksandar Bo≈°koviƒá, Albanci kao metafora The First Balkan War found the Albanians as a nation fighting for its own national state.

There were communist plans to create a Balkan federation which would include Yugoslavia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece. However, after the resolution of Informbiro 1948, Albania broke relations with the Yugoslav communists, because Enver Hoxha remained loyal to the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. = Yugoslav Wars = = 21st century = Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama visited Serbia and met with Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá on 10 November 2014 for the first meeting of its type between the two countries' leadership since the 1947 meeting of Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha with President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito. However, tempers flared when Rama said that Kosovo's independence was \\"undeniable\\" and \\"must be respected\\" and Vucic accused him of a \\"provocation\\".  Minority rights  In December 2008 Serbian police arrested ten former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), in an Albanian-populated area bordering Kosovo. Serbia's war crimes prosecution office stated that it had evidence that the ten KLA members had killed 51 people and kidnapped 159 civilians in Kosovo between June and October 1999.

He played minor league baseball as a pitcher in the Chicago White Sox organization from 2001 to 2005. After undergoing treatment for cancer, Reed enrolled at Texas Tech University and played college football from 2005 to 2008. He was selected as a first-team All- American offensive tackle in 2008. Early years and baseball Born in Clute, Texas, Reed attended Crossett High School in Crossett, AR. He was a three sport star in high school, playing a tight end and defensive end in football, Center in basketball, and as a pitcher with a 95-mile per hour fastball for the baseball team. He was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 2000 Major League Baseball June Amateur Draft and was also recruited by Houston Nutt to play college football for the Arkansas Razorbacks. The White Sox paid him a $550,000 signing bonus, and Reed opted for baseball. He spent four years from 2001 to 2004 playing minor league baseball as a pitcher in the White Sox organization. He compiled a 3-0 record and a 2.44 earned run average in 2002. During his minor league career, his fastball was clocked at 98 miles per hour. He was named the White Sox's \\"organizational pitcher of the year.\\" Brandon McCarthy, who played with Reed in 2002, recalled, \\"He would intimidate the hell out of you. He had muscles coming out of muscles. That was a sight. Cancer and recovery In 2003, Reed was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and underwent surgery to remove a tumor and three feet of his intestines. After several months of chemotherapy, Reed lost 30 pounds. When he recovered from the cancer treatment, his father was killed in an automobile accident. He returned to the White Sox in 2004, shortly after the death of his father, but his earned run average soared to 14.54 in five games for the Great Falls White Sox. College football After retiring from baseball in 2004, Reed enrolled at Texas Tech University, where he played college football. He began as a tight end as a freshman in 2005, before being moved to offensive tackle. After gaining 60 pounds, he became a starter for Texas Tech in 2007 and 2008. Reed set a Texas Tech record in 2008 with a 625-pound bench press. In 2008, Reed recalled having pitched to Barry Bonds during spring training in Tucson, Arizona. Bonds hit a fly ball to shallow right field for an out, prompting the Houston Chronicle to note: \\"That itself makes Reed arguably a one-man fraternity ‚Äî possibly the only offensive lineman in college or pro football history able to claim an out against baseball's home run king.\\" After the 2008 season, Reed was selected as a first-team All-American by both the Walter Camp Football Foundation and SI.com.

The objective of the Techno-lodges scheme is to encourage IT-enabled Services and Business Process Outsourcing companies to operate from low cost rural centres and thereby to create employment in rural areas.

I.T.Park A Techno-lodge is a small Information Technology park established by Government of Kerala in a small town or a village in Kerala. Techno-lodges constitute the third tier of the IT infrastructure in Kerala. The Government has set up two such parks in Perinad and Kadakkal Grama Panchayats in Kollam District. The objective of the Techno-lodges scheme is to encourage IT-enabled Services and Business Process Outsourcing companies to operate from low-cost rural centres and thereby to create employment in rural areas. The Techno-Lodge centres are set up in old unused government buildings, buildings belonging to government organizations, panchayaths or other local bodies. Techno-Lodge India's growth in the IT sector, especially in the ITeS and the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) has been largely driven by availability of low-cost skilled manpower, huge English speaking population and appropriate infrastructure. With the BPO industry flourishing in India, more and more companies began establishing their operations in metropolitan cities to capitalize on available human resource talent and physical infrastructure. But the prodigious expansion of BPO companies in select metropolitan cities has caused intense pressure on available human resource in these areas as well as physical infrastructure which has led to shooting up of costs for manpower as well as infrastructure. Due to these factors, some IT, ITeS, and BPO companies are now looking at smaller towns and villages. The low cost of operations and lower employee attrition levels are the key benefits that these companies derive from their rural operations. In order to provide an impetus to this advantage, Government have decided to set up Rural IT centres namely Tehno- Lodge Scheme, typically advantageous to IT companies which are looking for reducing operational costs. This scheme of Techno-Lodge envisages developing a small building which has a capacity of seating about 25 employees for IT, ITeS and BPO operations. The main objective of this scheme is to encourage ITeS and BPO companies to operate from low-cost rural centres and thereby to create employment in rural areas. The Techno-Lodge centres will be set up in old unused government buildings, buildings belonging to government organizations, panchayaths or other local bodies. Preference shall be given to panchayaths, who provide their existing buildings/ community halls free of cost for the scheme. Kerala State IT Infrastructure Limited (KSITIL) will be the main implementing agency for this scheme. Proposals have been received for the setting ip of rural IT Parks / Technolodges in small towns and Rural Panchayats wherever unutilized land/ buildings are available with Government / Local bodies. Some IT companies have expressed interest in migrating to rural areas to reduce their operational costs. Technologies can be set up in small towns and rural Panchayats inbuildings with a built up area of about . or land measuring at least . This Scheme will provide employment to rural youth, taking IT to smaller towns and cities and making use of utilized Government / local bodies buildings etc. Government have examined the matter in detail and are pleased to accord in principle sanction to Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited (KSITIL) for setting up rural IT Park / Techno lodges in small towns and rural panchayats wherever unutilized land / buildings are available with Government / Local bodies at free of cost. These lands / buildings will be jointly identified by Revenue and IT Departments. The value of land / buildings shall be treated as share capital contribution of Government in the equity of the KSITI Limited and the value of land/ building will be fixed by Government in consultation with the District Collector concerned.

Solar rays are also considered to be \\"strings\\" between the Sun and the spirits of plants, animals and humans. Turks who worship Koyash turn towards the sunrise when praying.

The power and vital force of the Sun God, making it a priority to bow to him each morning as he rises. Solar rays are strings that link the spirits of plants to heaven, and considered a medium for transmitting Tengri into infants. Koyash is often depicted as a fiery bird or a winged horse. These images are often used to adorn things such as ceramic pots and earrings in ancient times. The sun god Koyash can make \\"solar strands\\" from his hands capable of ensnaring and burning his victims. To the Altai people, the Sun represented light, warmth, and growth. This made the sun deity very important, as the Sun was seen as the ruler of all that he created. Then he is portrayed as a warrior. Sun in Turkish culture The Sun (also Koyash) was the son of G√∂k-Tengri (Sky God) and the Toprak Ana (Earth Goddess). The Turkish people and Mongols honoured the power and vital force of the Sun God. Reportedly the Huns, leaving their villages in the morning, welcomed the rising sun and bowed towards him. Altai people would turn towards the sunrise when praying. They worshipped the Sun because Gok-Tengri supervised the creation of the world by the Sun‚Äôs rays, which are but strings linking the spirits of plants to the Sun. Likewise solar rays were considered a medium for transmitting the life force sent by Tengri to the infant. A vivid example is the legend of the birth of An Lushan by a Shamaness. At his conception it was said that a ray of light penetrated the yurt. Alan-Goa, the mother of the Mongols, conceived from a ray that penetrated the yurt through a smoke hole. The Turkish people associated the Sun‚Äôs path in the sky with the flight of a fire-bird or a winged horse. Flying (winged) horses as symbols of the Sun were widely used in the cosmological myths of Turkish peoples. And other animals (rams, deer, bulls) were also connected with the Sun.

The Thrikkadavoor Mahadeva Temple is the most famous Siva Temple in Kollam District. It is situated in the Thrikkadavoor Panchayath and on the banks of the Ashtamudi lake. Mrikandu rishi and his wife Marudmati worshipped Shiva and sought from him the boon of begetting a son. As a result, he was given the choice of either a gifted son, but with a short life on earth or a child of low intelligence but with a long life. Mrikandu rishi chose the former, and was blessed with Markandeya, an exemplary son, destined to die at the age of 16. Markandeya grew up to be a great devotee of Shiva and on the day of his destined death he continued his worship of Shiva in his aniconic form of Shivalingam. The messengers of Yama, the god of death were unable to take away his life because of his great devotion and continual worship of Shiva. Yama then came in person to take away Markandeya's life, and sprung his noose around the young sage's neck. By accident or fate the noose mistakenly landed around the Shivalingam, and out of it, Shiva emerged in all his fury attacking Yama for his act of aggression. After defeating Yama in battle to the point of death, Shiva then revived him, under the condition that the devout youth would live forever. For this act, Shiva was thereafter known also as Kalantaka (\\"Ender of Death\\"). This was said to have happened in Thirukkadavoor also call Thrikkadavoor. Thus Maha Mrityunjaya Stotra is also attributed to Markandeya,[4] and this legend of Shiva conquering death is inscribed in metal and worshipped at Thirukkadavoor mahadeva temple. The annual Srattu festival attracts thousands of people, including foreigners. The festival falls in the month of Kumbham (February/March). The eight artificial horses, which represent the eight areas (karas) around the temple, is a special attraction for tourists.

There were early forms of idol worship beneath a Vetti tree (name Vettikkavala would have likely emanated from this legend) in the village, which was roughly situated near present day government school. Based on available records a temple was constructed associated with it by queen of Elayadath Swaroopam around 17th or 18th century. The Elayadath Swaroopam centered at Kottarakkara was brought under Travancore in 1742 by troops of Marthanda Varma as a result of Travancore‚ÄìDutch War. The temple continued in a dilaptated situation for many years after the annexation. However in 1900 (Malayalam era 1176) under the insistence of palace manager Sankaran Thampi the king of Travancore, Moolam Thirunal renovated the temple into current structure. The temple came under Travancore Devaswom Board as a major temple. In the year 1996 another set of maintenance was undertook around the temple as a result of which a portion of kulikkadavu around temple pond got completely damaged. In the southern side of temple there is a palace constructed by Travancore kings during reign of Moolam Thirunal. This palace was meant for kings and royal family members to stay during their visits to the temple. = Other Religious Places = * Ancient Sadananda Asramam, Sadanandapuram * Kannamcode Sree Subrahmanya Swami Temple * Edamana Madom Sree Bhagavathy Trust Raktheswary Kudumba Paradevatha Temple * Koikkal Sree Dharma Sastha Temple * Villur Vaikuntanatha Temple. * Chirattakonam Church.  = Tourist Attraction = * Kallada Irrigation Project is a main attraction situated in Thalachira near Thengumcodu. * KTDC Motel Aaraam, Sadanandapuram. * Pinnacle View Point, Thalachira. * Kazhuvudayan kunnu, Pachoor. = Educational Institution = Vettikavala Government Model High School is a highly achieved and academically, a very scholastic school.

The Ballal Kings of Sullia had ruled this area around 1100 years back. The Tulu Brahmin migration to Tulunaad might have happened during the lifetime of the Kadamba king Mayuravarma at 345 AD. During the 13th century, the Hindu philosopher Madhvacharya built the eight Ashta Muttas (eight monasteries) in modern Udipi district that was partitioned from Mangalore district. During the rule of the Vijayanagara dynasty, Tulu Nadu was administered in two parts‚ÄîMangaluru Rajya and Barakuru Rajya. Tulu Nadu was the original homeland of the Tuluva dynasty, the third dynasty of the Vijayanagara monarchy. Tulu Nadu was governed by feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire until the 17th century. The longest reigning dynasty of Tulu Nadu were the Alupas, feudatories and nobility of the prominent dynasties of Carnatica. The Kadamba dynasty of Banavasi was the earliest, under which the Alupas flourished. Later the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, Chalukyas of Badami, Chalukyas of Kalyani, Hoysalas of Durasamudra and rayas (kings) of Vijayanagara were the overlords. The Alupas, however, were independent and their subordination was nominal at best. They ruled during the Vijaynagara domination of Tulu Nadu from 14th to the 17th centuries. The region became extremely prosperous during Vijayanagara period with Barcoor and Mangalore gaining importance. After the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, much of Tulu Nadu came under the control of the Keladi Nayakas of Ikkeri. A typical red tile-roofed house in Tulu Nadu Over the following many centuries, more ethnic groups migrated to the area. Various Hindu Konkani people namely Gaud Saraswat Brahmins, Daivajnya Brahmins, Karhad Brahmins, a few Chitpavans (Konkanastha Brahmins), Vaani, a few Rajapur Saraswats arrived by sea during the religious persecution by lawless Portuguese pirates and ex-jailbirds. Mangalore was a major port that served not only the Portuguese but also the Arabs for maritime trades. Jains were already a prominent group and even today are uniquely preserved in Tulunaad. Though small in number, the Jains left behind indelible reminders of their glory with temples (bastis) in Moodabidri, and monolithic statues of Bahubali and the Gomateshwara in Karkala, Venoor& Dharmasthala. In the 16th century, there was a large influx of New Christians who fled the Inquisition in Portuguese Goa, they were given refuge in the area by the Nayakas of Keladi, particularly by Kittur Chennamma. The settlement of these New Christians in the area gave rise to their own unique and mixed culture that developed into a localised community of Mangalorean Christians, distinct from Goan Christians and East Indians, they built prominent educational institutions and contributed to socio-economic progress in the area. The Muslims of Tulu Nadu are basically descended from Arab traders who married local women and settled there. They speak Beary, which is a mix of Tulu and Malayalam. Demographics Majority of Mangaloreans belong to the Tuluva ethnic group. The Tuluvas have historically been concentrated in the coastal areas. The major Tulu speaking castes are Shettigar, Mundalas, Mogeras, Bairas, Samagaras, Billavas, Sapaliga, Bunts, Mogaveeras, Kulala's, Devadiga's, Tulu Brahmins, Vishwakarmas and Nayak's. Mangalorean Protestants are also mostly Tulu speakers. The next largest group are the Konkanis, in particular the Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Daivadnya Brahmins as well as the Mangalorean Catholics whose ancestors migrated here from Goa, due to persecution by the Portuguese. Other groups who historically settled in Tulu Nadu, include the Kannadigas and Bearys. Culture =Cuisine= Neer dosa, a variant of dosa, is native to Mangalore. Mangalorean cuisine is largely influenced by the South Indian cuisine, with several cuisines being unique to the diverse communities of the city. Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most Mangalorean Curry, as are ginger, garlic and chili. Mangalorean Fish Curry is popular dish in Canara. The Tulu community's well-known dishes include Kori Rotti (dry rice flakes dipped in gravy), Chicken Ghee Roast, Bangude Pulimunchi (silver-grey mackerels), Beeja-Manoli Upkari, Neer dosa (lacy rice-cr√™pes), Boothai Gasi, Kadabu, and Patrode. The Kube Sukkhe, a traditional clam dish of Mangalorean Protestants is also very popular. The Konkani community's specialities include Daali thoy, beebe-upkari (cashew based), val val, avnas ambe sasam, Kadgi chakko, paagila podi, and chana gashi. Tuluva vegetarian cuisine in Mangalore, also known as Udupi cuisine, is known and liked throughout the state and region. Since Mangalore is a coastal town, fish forms the staple diet of most people. Mangalorean Catholics' Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna ‚Äìidli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas ‚ÄìPork), Pork Bafat, Sorpotel and the Mutton Biryani are well-known dishes. Pickles such as happala, sandige and puli munchi are unique to Mangalore. Shendi (toddy), a country liquor prepared from coconut flower sap, is popular. =Traditions= Many classical dance forms and folk art are practised among Mangaloreans. The Yakshagana, a night-long dance and drama performance, is held in Mangalore, while Hulivesha (literally, tiger dance), a folk dance unique to the city, is performed during Dasara and Krishna Janmashtami. Karadi Vesha (bear dance) is another well known dance performed during Dasara. Paddanas (Ballad-like epics passed on through generations by word of mouth) are sung by a community of impersonators in Tulu and are usually accompanied by the rhythmic drum beats. The Bearys' unique traditions are reflected in such folk songs as kolkai (sung during kolata, a valour folk-dance during which sticks used as props), unjal pat (traditional lullaby), moilanji pat, and oppune pat (sung at weddings). The Evkaristik Purshanv (Konkani: Eucharistic procession) is an annual Catholic religious procession led on the first Sunday of each New Year. =World record= On 26‚Äì27 January 2008, a Konkani cultural event, Konkani Nirantari, held in Mangalore by a Mangalorean organization, Mandd Sobhann, entered the Guinness Book of World Records for non-stop singing of Konkani hymns.

Information may include pictures of the obverse and reverse (front and back), date and place of minting, distribution type, translation of inscriptions, description of images, theme, metal type, mintage, edge description, orientation of the coin, weight, diameter, thickness, design credentials, shape and prices for various grades. Defects may be described. The quality, detail and completeness of the information available about a particular coin varies according to popularity, commonality, and available scholarly research. Because of the huge number of coins in world history, there are no comprehensive catalogs. Professional collectors typically keep many books for identification and assessment. Most commonly, coin catalogs come in one of two forms. Reference works such as A Guide Book of United States Coins, published by Whitman Publishing and more popularly known as the Red Book, and the Standard Catalog of World Coins, published by Krause Publications, give descriptions and approximate prices of coins at many different levels of preservation, or grades. The other form is the auction catalog, where only those specific coins available in the auction are described, with photo plates available for some of the more prominent coins. Coin catalogs are essential when dealing with ancient or foreign coins, where the inscriptions may be obscure and unrecognizably stylized, even for a native speaker. Coin catalogs today are supplemented by Internet sites, some of which have the advantage of being attached to user forums, so that issues such as counterfeiting may be discussed. These sites also provide tools connected to catalogs for tracking collections. With the rise of online auctions, it is now possible for collectors to research their coins at commercial sites as well as myriad collector-created sites containing research into diverse collecting specialties. Public and private institutions which hold significant collections of coins (and other money-objects) also produce catalogs - these integrate scholarly research of different disciplines - see, for example, the British Museum Catalogues of Coins.

He obtained his BA in English Literature from the Faculty of Arts, Alexandria University in 1949. He then began a teaching career that lasted until 1955, when he abandoned it for a post in the press as a literary critic. He worked at several press institutions, including: ‚ÄúRose El Youssef‚Äù, ‚ÄúEl Tahrir‚Äù and ‚ÄúAl Gomhouriyya‚Äù. Farag took part in the establishment of the public management for the ‚Äúmass culture‚Äù project and in the foundation of artistic groups in Egypt. He also had an important role in the introduction of theatre in Egypt‚Äôs provinces. He, with many great writers like Noaman Ashour, Saad Eddin Wahba, Michael Roman, Rashad Roushdy and Yousef Edrees, contributed in the ‚Äúnothing like‚Äù renaissance of theatre in the sixties. Alfred Farag wrote his first play ‚ÄúFall of Pharaoh‚Äù (1957) at the age of 26. He thenproceeded with his career as a writer. He wrote approximately 52 plays, including: ‚ÄúThe Barber of Baghdad‚Äù (1964), ‚ÄúSulayman Al-Halabi‚Äù (1965), ‚ÄúAl-Zayr Salim‚Äù (1967) and ‚ÄúAtwa with the Jack-Knife‚Äù (1993), in addition to some one-act plays such as ‚ÄúVoice of Egypt‚Äù (1956) and ‚ÄúThe Trap‚Äù (1965). In his plays, he discusses serious issues like the problem of national independence in ‚ÄúThe Epistles of the Judge of Seville‚Äù (1987), and the Palestinian issue in ‚ÄúFire and Olives‚Äù (1970). Some of his works were translated into German and English such as ‚ÄúAli Janah Al - Tabrizi and his Servant Quffa‚Äù (1969) or into English only such as ‚ÄúMarriage on a Divorce Notification‚Äù (1973). In addition to being a playwright, he also wrote novels such as ‚ÄúThe Story of the Lost Time‚Äù (1977) and ‚ÄúThe Days and Nights of Sindbad‚Äù (1988), and short stories. In his writings, he eloquently mixed the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic with the Standard Arabic which made his works unique and easy for people to understand. Critics became interested in Farag's dramatic language as it was vivid and far from the formal style used by his predecessors. He believed that the language should contribute in giving a ‚Äúvisual‚Äù illustration of the text What made him different from others is that he revived the old heritage on stage as if it was real, and that he used heritage without getting superficial. Farag was granted several international, Arab and Egyptian awards and medals. The best known award was ‚ÄúJerusalem‚Äù given by the General Union for Arab Writers as he was the first Egyptian intellectual to receive such an award. He also received the National Award for Play writing in 1965, and the Science and Arts Medal of the first order in 1967. Farag died on 4 December 2005 at the age of 76 in the St Mary's Hospital, London after a long term of illness. He was buried in Cairo.

Will Arikkulam give us a savant who will unravel its past? There is also a derived fable that the village of Arikkulam was initially called as \\"Harikulam\\", \\"Hari\\" meaning Lord Vishnu and \\"kulam\\" meaning pool together meaning \\"Lord Vishnu's pool\\". This may be the reason why the village has a temple devoted the formerly mentioned lord \\"Areekkunnath Vishnu Temple\\". Another local temple of this area is the \\"Oravingal Bhagavathi temple\\".

At the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912, he was positioned at the Ionian island of Corfu. There, he assembled a small corps of volunteers from his home region, augmented by 200 Cretan volunteers. On 5 November, Himara rose in revolt and his force landed and occupied this coastal region, without facing initially resistance. Spyromylios then suggested to the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos that the Greek Army should immediately capture the city of Vlor√´, north of Himara.Kondis Basil. Greece and Albania, 1908-1914. Institute for Balkan Studies, 1976, p. 93. However, on November 28, the Albanians declared their independence in Vlor√´ and formed a provisional government. The Greek headquarters expected full-scale attack in the area and ordered him to retreat. He rejected the order and remained in the region organizing the local defense. When the Second Balkan War ended, a series of peace treaties and protocols awarded the area to the newly formed Albanian state and the Greek forces were ordered to evacuate the area. At 9 February 1914 Spyromilios refused to withdraw and declared the region‚Äôs autonomy and himself as captain of Himara. Himara became part of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, proclaimed on February 28 in Gjirokast√´r. Spyromilios became member of the Greek Parliament for the Argyrokastron Prefecture at the following elections. At September 1916, when the Italian army entered the region he escaped to Athens. In the next years he was involved in the Northern Epirus issue. At 1926 he was honorary discharged with the rank of Colonel. Legacy Spyromilios kept correspondence with Albanian personalities, discussing the region‚Äôs political future. A distinguished Albanian, Eqerem Bej of Vlor√´, noted that Spyromilios and his family were known for their loyalty towards their friends, bravery and persistence. Spyromilios‚Äô family mansion in Himara, is one of the town‚Äôs main attractions, although abandoned today.

Von Rohr was an immigrant to Denmark, and in 1757 was appointed as municipal buildings inspector and government land surveyor of the Danish West Indies, now known as the United States Virgin Islands. The Danish crown also commissioned a study of the natural history of the islands. Von Rohr started a botanic garden in Christiansted on the island of St. Croix, corresponding with noted natural history scientists back in Denmark and in Europe. In the 1780s he studied cotton cultivation in the Antilles, exploring as far as Cayenne and Cartagena. By now he had been given the rank of lieutenant colonel.Saint Croix 1770-1776 In the 1790s Denmark considered abolishing the Atlantic slave trade, a measure expected to bring down the flourishing sugarcane plantations of the Danish West Indies. Von Rohr, who by this time had acquired considerable administrative experience of the colony, was asked to investigate the feasibility of establishing plantation agriculture in the vicinity of the old Danish slaving forts of Guinea on the West African coast. Von Rohr packed and sent ahead to Fort Christiansborg his surveying instruments and library, a catalogue of titles reflecting his colonial involvement. His library included books and periodicals sent to him from England by Joseph Banks. He traveled via the United States, where he was entertained by prominent public figures and natural historians in Philadelphia and New York City. It is claimed that Von Rohr's mission ended abruptly when the ship on which he was travelling to Africa from New York disappeared somewhere in the Atlantic. Botanist Benjamin Smith Barton, though, declared that he did make the voyage safely, but died of fever shortly after: \\"....my friend the late Mr. Julius von Rohr, a gentleman whose death is a real loss to natural science, and perhaps an irreparable loss to the interests of an injured and oppressed part of mankind: I mean the Blacks. In the summer of 1793, I took my last adieu of this learned botanist, and most amiable man. He sailed, from New York, for the coast of Africa, where he contemplated the establishment of a colony of Blacks. A few days after he had landed on the African continent, he died of a malignant fever. With him, I fear, has perished, for a long time at least, one of the best concerted schemes for the safe and happy emancipation of the swarthy children of Africa. Von Rohr was another Howard. In benevolence and good sense, he was, at least, equal to the great English philanthropist. In science certainly, and perhaps in the simplicity of his conduct, and the unambitious fervour of his zeal, he was the superior\\".

Gonfaloniere of Justice (Gonfaloniere di Giustizia) was a post in the government of medieval and early Renaissance Florence. Like Florence's Priori, it was introduced in 1293 when Giano Della Bella's Ordinances of Justice came into force. He was one of the nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months, who formed the government, or Signoria. As Gonfaloniere di Giustizia he was the temporary standard-bearer of the Republic of Florence and custodian of the city's banner, which was displayed from the yardarm of a portable cross. Along with the voting rights of the other Priori, he was also in charge of the internal security forces and the maintenance of public order.John M. Najemy, A History of Florence, 1200‚Äì1575 (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2008), 84‚Äì85. To distinguish him from his other eight colleagues, his crimson coat, lined with ermine, was further embroidered with golden stars. Each of Florence's neighborhoods, or rioni, had its own priore who might be selected to serve on the council, and its own gonfaloniere di compagnia selected from the first families of each quarter. History =Prelude= Florin (1332‚Äì1348) The gonfaloniere di giustizia in 1366 was Niccolo Brunetti.13th century Italy was a 'land of cities' and Florence was one of the richest and most politically restless among them. The most obvious signs of this prosperity and economic power were its striking of 3.5 gram gold florins and the presence of the city's large mercantile and financier companies right across Europe and Africa. These companies' leaders demanded increasing involvement in the city's political life, claiming equal or greater dignity than the old noble families who held now unproductive rural land outside the town. In the 13th and 14th centuries the Arti Maggiori would be key to the city's economic ascent and the middle class's revenge on the feudal nobility. This state of affairs would last until at least 1347, when the English monarchy's bankruptcy due to its high military expenditure in the Hundred Years' War dragged even the Bardi and Peruzzi businesses (the latter alone owed around 600,000 guilders) into ruin. =After the Ordinances= Siege of Florence in 1530 The post of Gonfaloniere survived practically until the abolition of the Republican constitution by the Medici on their return to the city in 1530. Indeed, in the 15th century the post was given to many members of the Medici family and their neighbouring and allied families, giving them a kind of recognised power within the republican framework and de facto (though never de jure) allowing them to take over the powers of the other old magistracies. After the expulsion of Piero the Unfortunate in 1494 and during the brief rule of Girolamo Savonarola (executed in 1498), the Florentine families tried to reorganise the city government on the model of the old communal magistracies. Pier Soderini was in 1502 appointed gonfaloniere for life, but only held it until the end of 1512, when the Medici returned and Piero decided to abandon the city. During his tenure, Soderini held more direct political responsibility than either Cosimo de' Medici or Lorenzo de' Medici. Machiavelli served as his secretary. Although many of the Ottimati or aristocrats had supported Soderini's candidacy for Gonfaloniere a Vita, believing he would support their interests, they turned against him when his popular leanings became clear.Najemy (2008), 405‚Äì9. In 1512, after fierce resistance to imperial troops under Charles V and pope Julius II, it was finally forced to surrender. This marked the end of the republican dream and its offices, with the start of the ascent of the grand-ducal Medici dynasty.

It is also a term of art used in the definition of the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. It replaces the former offence of reckless driving. Canada's Criminal Code has equivalent provisions covering dangerous driving (see \\"Canada\\" section below). England and Wales and Scotland =Statute= This offence is created by section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as substituted by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 _Section 1 Road Traffic Act 1991_ ): \\"Dangerously\\" A person is to be regarded as driving dangerously for the purposes of sections 1 and 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 if *the way he/she drives falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, and it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous;The Road Traffic Act 1988, section 2A(1) (as inserted by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991) or *if it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving the vehicle in its current state (for the purpose of the determination of which regard may be had to anything attached to or carried on or in it, and to the manner in which it is attached or carried) would be dangerous.The Road Traffic Act 1988, sections 2A(2) and (4) (as inserted by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991) In this context, \\"dangerous\\" refers to danger either of injury to any person or of serious damage to property; and in determining what would be expected of, or obvious to, a competent and careful driver in a particular case, regard shall be had not only to the circumstances of which he could be expected to be aware but also to any circumstances shown to have been within the knowledge of the accused.The Road Traffic Act 1988, sections 2A(3) (as inserted by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991) In Attorney General's Reference (No 4 of 2000) (2001) 2 Cr. App. R. 417 Woolf CJ said at p 422: Thus, whereas the underlying test of dangerousness is objective, a test based on the concept of \\"obviousness\\" considers the extent of knowledge as to causation. This test is hybrid, drawing both on the actual subjective knowledge that the accused had in his or her mind at the time the actus reus of driving occurred, and on the knowledge that would have been in the mind of a reasonable person (see mens rea and criminal negligence for discussion on the nature of these tests and the scope of the reasonable person). The Court of Appeal held in the case of R v Banister _Bannister, R. v [2009] EWCA Crim 1571 (28 July 2009)_ that police drivers get no special treatment. \\"The special skill (or indeed lack of skill) of a driver is an irrelevant circumstance when considering whether the driving is dangerous\\". =Sentence= In England and Wales and Scotland, a person guilty of dangerous driving is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years, or to a fine, or to both, or on summary conviction, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.The Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, section 33 and Part I of Schedule 2 Any conviction for dangerous driving (or causing death by dangerous driving) for a driver holding a licence issued by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (Northern Ireland) or Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (for licences issued in England, Wales or Scotland) will result in a mandatory disqualification if the offence took place in the United Kingdom proper, Isle of Man or Republic of Ireland (see also Traffic violations reciprocity). The driver must return to being a learner driver, even if the offence did not result in death or grievous bodily harm, and an extended practical driving test, about 70 minutes long and about 30 minutes longer than the regular driving test, must be taken by the driver to regain his or her full driving licence. =History= The offence of causing death by reckless driving was created by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 and then by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. It was abolished, and replaced with the offence of causing death by dangerous driving by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991. After it was substituted by section 50(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977, section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 read as follows: A person guilty of this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

A key article by Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are, were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person's close friends.Martin, Brett A. S., Christina K.C. Lee, Clinton Weeks and Maria Kaya (2013), \\"How to stop binge drinking and speeding motorists: Effects of relational-interdependent self-construal and self-referencing on attitudes toward social marketing \\" , Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 12, 81-90. Canada =The offence= The offence of \\"dangerous operation of a conveyance\\" is created by section 320.13(1) of the Criminal Code.Criminal Code, section 320.13(1). A \\"conveyance\\" is defined as \\"a motor vehicle, a vessel, an aircraft or railway equipment\\".Criminal Code, section 320.11. The actus reus of the offence is \\"driving in a manner dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances\\".R v Roy, 2012 SCC 26 at para 28. The mens rea of the offence is \\"that the degree of care exercised by the accused was a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused‚Äôs circumstances\\".R v Roy, 2012 SCC 26 at para 28. =Excluding causing death or bodily harm by dangerous driving= The equivalent, under the country's Criminal Code, to \\"dangerous driving\\", is Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle. The offence can be tried summarily or on indictment. The maximum prison sentences that can be imposed are: * if tried summarily, 2 years minus one day.Criminal Code, sections 320.19(5)(b) and 787(1) * if tried by indictment, 10 years.Criminal Code, section 320.19(5)(a) A licence suspension is mandatory, and will be for a minimum of 12 months if the person has no prior Criminal Code driving convictions on his or her record. Anyone with a prior conviction, for a Criminal Code driving offence, will receive a longer licence suspension, but will also receive a prison sentence. Some provinces count equivalents, to Criminal Code driving convictions, if such convictions occur in certain American states. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation counts equivalents, to Criminal Code driving convictions, if they occur in New York or Michigan. Those equivalent to dangerous driving are included. =Causing death or bodily harm= Dangerous operation causing bodily harm is a hybrid offence and may be tried summarily or by indictment.Criminal Code, sections 320.13(2) and 320.2 Dangerous operation causing death may only be tried by indictment.Criminal Code, sections 320.13(3) and 320.21 Custodial sentences will almost always be given as a result of a conviction for either type of dangerous driving charge. Anyone convicted of dangerous operation causing bodily harm is subject to a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.Criminal Code, sections 320.13(2) and 320.2 The Criminal Code defines bodily harm as \\"any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature\\".Criminal Code, section 2 Anyone convicted of dangerous operation causing death is subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.Criminal Code, sections 320.13(3) and 320.21 Although the minimum driving prohibition of 12 months (or more, if the conviction or guilty plea is to a 2nd or subsequent Criminal Code offence) applies to any conviction of causing death or grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving, driving prohibitions, in these cases, are often longer than 12 months. Some provinces, such as Ontario, Alberta and Nova Scotia, require the resitting of all theory and practical driving tests if the licence suspension is longer than a prescribed time period.

'Although estimates of the reserves contained in this area vary wildly, some have suggested that it could be home to one of the world's richest diamond deposits'.\\"Zimbabwe\\", Global Witness. The hugely prolific fields are regarded by some experts as the world's biggest diamond (in carats, not by value) find in more than a century.Inside Zimbabwe's controversial Marange diamond field \\"Zimbabwe\\", CNN, 16 March 2012. Production from Marange is controversial due to ongoing legal wrangles and government crackdowns on illegal miners and allegations of forced labour. In terms of carats produced, the Marange field is the largest diamond producing project in the world, estimated to have produced 16.9 million carats in 2013, or 13% of global rough diamond supply. Marange is estimated to have produced 12.0 million carats in 2012, 8.7 million carats in 2011, and 8.2 million carats in 2010. While some diamond mines produce rough valued at over $1000 per carat, average production at Marange is estimated at under $50 per carat. Ownership From the early 1980s, De Beers held an Exclusive Prospecting Order (EPO) over Marange via their subsidiary Kimberlitic Searches Ltd. Their EPO expired in 2006 and exploration rights were taken up by British-registered African Consolidated Resources. Production from Marange is controversial due to ongoing legal wrangles and government crackdowns on illegal miners. In December 2006, the company was readying trial mining operations when the Government of Zimbabwe took over the rights via the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation, despite African Consolidated Resources winning a court case allowing them to continue mining. In April 2010 the High Court of Zimbabwe ruled that the government could sell diamonds from Marange as it dismissed an application from British-based African Consolidated Resources to stop diamond sales from the disputed fields.\\"Pressure group warns Zimbabwe against diamond sale\\", Reuters, 28 April 2010. In September 2010, the Zimbabwe High Court formally revoked a ruling from a year earlier that restored mining rights to British-based, African Consolidated Resources Plc.\\"Zimbabwe revokes Marange diamond ruling\\", Financial Times, 7 September 2010. As of February 2014, the diamond fields are operated by 7 private entities all of which are partnered with the Zimbabwe government under the affiliate Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC). All 7 of the private companies are allegedly affiliated with Zimbabwe ex-military or political officials. The 7 companies currently operating are: Marange Resources, Anjin Investments Ltd., Diamond Mining Company, Gyn Nyame Resources, Jinan Mining Ltd., Kusena Diamonds, and Mbada Diamonds. History =Mineral rush= A mineral rush began in September 2006, but accelerated following the government take-over. By mid-December 2006, around 10,000 illegal artisanal miners were working very small plots at Marange, and an immediate water, sanitation and housing crisis developed. The miners initially sold their diamonds to the government, but a black market rapidly developed, offering better prices. Although the official plan was for the government to mine at Marange, in practice mining has been carried out to the benefit of senior government and Zanu-PF officials and those close to them, with little income returned to the government.Kambemba, C. 2007. Kimberly Process Certification Scheme: Compliance and limitations in Southern Africa. Southern Africa Resources Watch / South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Speaking anonymously, a Harare-based diplomat said By late 2008, mining was being carried out by soldiers, using local villagers for forced labour. The soldiers occasionally pay the villagers with diamonds and surrender much of the produce to their senior officers. According to one soldier interviewed by IRIN: =Government crackdowns= The government launched police crackdowns against illegal miners and smugglers several times since December 2006. In November 2008 the Air Force of Zimbabwe was sent, after some police officers began refusing orders to shoot the illegal miners. Up to 150 of the estimated 30,000\\"Zimbabwe meets diamond trade standards\\", IRIN, 30 June 2010. illegal miners were shot from helicopter gunships. In 2008 some Zimbabwean lawyers and opposition politicians from Mutare claimed that Shiri was the prime mover behind the military assaults on illegal diggers in the diamond mines in the east of Zimbabwe. Estimates of the death toll by mid-December range from 83 reported by the Mutare City Council, based on a request for burial ground, to 140 estimated by the (then) opposition Movement for Democratic Change - Tsvangirai party. The military operation, known as Operation No Return, also involved searching travellers into and out of the Mutare West area, with people found in possession of foreign currency or diamonds being detained and being forced to fill in holes on the diamond fields. On 28 January 2009, the government announced plans to resettle some 4,700 villagers from Chiadzwa to the 12,000 ha Transau Farm, on the Odzi River. Although Manicaland Provincial Governor Christopher Mushohwe said that the move had the full support of the local traditional leaders, Chiadzwa villagers protested the resettlement. =2010: Sale of Marange diamonds= In 2010 Zimbabwe's High Court ruled that the government could sell Marange diamonds. International pressure group Global Witness warned Zimbabwe against selling diamonds until the government complied with plans agreed with diamond monitors, the Kimberley Process to reform mining at Marange. In June 2010 the Kimberley Process monitor appointed to review procedures and conditions at Marange reported that, \\"Based on evidence provided by the government of Zimbabwe and private investors, and on...first- hand assessment of the situation, Zimbabwe has satisfied the minimum requirements of the KPCS for trade in rough diamonds\\". In September 2010, the Zimbabwe High Court formally revoked a ruling from a year earlier that restored mining rights to British-based, African Consolidated Resources Plc. In August 2010 Zimbabwe resumed the sale of diamonds from the Marange fields. On August 11, buyers flew into the country's capital, Harare, from all over the world, including Israel, India, Lebanon and Russia to capitalise on the sale of over US$1.5 billion worth of diamonds.\\"Zimbabwe holds ¬£1bn diamond sale\\", 11 August 2010. Press Reports describe the Marange find as, 'the biggest in southern Africa since diamonds were discovered in South Africa a century ago'. In September 2013, Belgian and diamond industry officials successfully lobbied the European Union to lift sanctions on ZMDC diamonds. In December 2013, the first European Union Marange auction took place in Antwerp and fetched $10 million for 300,000 carats, working out to a price of just over $30 per-carat on average. A second auction is scheduled for February 12‚Äì21, 2014 where another 300,000 carats will be sold. =2016: Nationalization= In March 2016, president Mugabe announced that the government was nationalizing its diamond mines. Diamond-related mining licences were revoked or not renewed. Mbada Diamonds and Anjin Investments have sued the government in the country's high court. The court ruled twice in their favor, yet the governeent did not renew any licence. With the workers out of the mines, security needs to be increased as looters are targeting the left-out mines. =Torture= The BBC, the British state broadcaster, claims Zimbabwe's security forces have a torture camp in the Marange diamond fields; methods include severe beatings, sexual assault and dog mauling according to alleged victims. International response Zimbabwe is a participant in the Kimberley Process (KP), that regulates trade in diamonds, although by June 2007 the KP annual plenary stated that it noted with concern the continuing challenges to KP implementation in Zimbabwe and recommended further monitoring of developments and concerted actions in that respect. The World Diamond Council has called for a clampdown on smuggling of diamonds from Zimbabwe. In December 2008, the Kimberley Process Civil Society Coalition, representing non-governmental organisations which participate in KP, called for Zimbabwe's suspension. In a statement issued by Global Witness, the coalition said the Kimberley Process (should) suspend Zimbabwe from the rough diamond certification scheme, in light of recent violence used by the government to take control of the Chiadzwa diamond fields. On 5 November 2009, however, the Kimberley Process conducted its annual meeting in Namibia and decided against the suspension of Zimbabwe. Instead, it recommended and then implemented with the compliance of the Zimbabwean government a 12-month working plan to monitor diamonds mined from the Marange field. The plan is aimed towards preventing exports curbing illegal digging, stopping smuggling of diamonds from Marange, better securing the area, improving the accounting and auditing of Marange diamonds, and supervising exports from the mine. Many NGO‚Äôs came out in support of the plan, while others protested it as shielding Zimbabwe‚Äôs alleged grave human rights abuses. The Rapaport Group, chaired by Martin Rapaport, went so far as to ban traders on its internet diamond trading network from trading any diamonds from the Marange fields. Towards the end of 2009, it was claimed that Marange diamonds were being smuggled out of Zimbabwe through Mozambique. On 6 May 2010, the KP Chair reminded all participants that they should maintain vigilance to ensure that Marange diamonds comply with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The five-page notice also included photographs and descriptions of rough diamonds from the Marange fields: \\"On first sight, strong 'gravel' impression resembling rounded pebbles in a riverbed. Look like tumbled and abraded coarse chips of broken beer bottles with colours ranging from dark brown to black to darkish green. Most surfaces are matt (sic) and dulled with rounded corners and edges. Broken surfaces display 'metallic-like' lustre.\\" The report also contains photographs showing Marange diamonds in various stages of processing, so they can be recognized if they are mixed in with a legitimate diamond export. In July 2010 the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme agreed that diamonds from Marange could be sold on the international market after a report from the Scheme's monitor a month earlier described diamonds mined from the fields as conflict-free.  Global Witness Quits Group on ‚ÄòBlood Diamonds‚Äô  The New York Times reported on Monday, 5 December 2011\\"Global Witness Quits Group on ‚ÄòBlood Diamonds‚Äô,\\" 5 December 2011. that Global Witness had withdrawn from the Kimberley Process coalition, saying that it felt the effort no longer effectively ensured that conflict diamonds did not make their way onto retail markets. The organization is the first advocacy group to leave the program. While the organization had expressed concerns over the operation of the Kimberley Process for some time, the final straw leading to its withdrawal was the decision to allow Zimbabwe to export diamonds from the Marange fields, where there have been reports of widespread human rights abuses by government security forces. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most egregious situation that we‚Äôve seen since the Kimberley Process was launched, where diamonds have been fueling violence and human rights violations, and the Kimberley has really failed to deal with that effectively,‚Äù said Annie Dunnebacke, the senior campaigner for Global Witness. The diamond industry was ‚Äúhiding behind the Kimberley Process,‚Äù Ms. Dunnebacke said, adding that many traders and dealers did not perform due diligence in checking the actual source of the diamonds they were dealing. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve just been saying, ‚ÄòWe have the Kimberley Process for diamonds, so that‚Äôs that. We‚Äôve solved the problem of blood diamonds.‚Äô‚Äù Farai Maguwu, the director of the Zimbabwe-based Centre for Research and Development, which is also a member of the Kimberley Process, said he believed Global Witness‚Äôs withdrawal was not enough to bring down the entire Kimberley Process. But, he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a very big blow. The Kimberley Process will never be the same without the Global Witness,‚Äù Mr. Maguwu said. ‚ÄúA very influential member of the Kimberley Process has cast a vote of no confidence in the Kimberley Process, which will affect the way the whole world views the Kimberley Process going forward.‚Äù Water poisoning A 2012 study commissioned by the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association (ZELA) and conducted by the University of Zimbabwe found that operations at the diamond fields are releasing dangerous chemicals into the Save River. This is having dire consequences on the communities that live downstream from the river and there was panic in October 2012 when residents of these communities learned of the findings of the report and the potential medical effects this could have. Three diamond mining companies were found to be at fault; Anjin, Diamond Mining Corporation and Marange Resources. Rigged elections In 2013, US- based investigative platform 100 Reporters published Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) documents revealing how $1 billion diamond revenues and support from companies including Mbada, Anjin and China Sonangol, would be invested in security and intelligence measures designed to rig the elections. The article identified the Chinese role (including an official from the Chinese Communist Party),and alleged kickbacks to leaders in the SADC, dated May 2013, with the intent of having Mugabe become chair. Soon after the elections, this came to pass. The CIO listed specific steps taken to numerically rig the polls: \\"Registering less than ten real voters on ‚Äúany given day with direct command from Nikuv‚Äù and the Party; Populating the voters‚Äô roll before, and during, elections to counter unfavorable voting outcomes; Parallel registration and mobilization for ‚Äústatistical maneuvering, depopulation and population of hostile constituencies,‚Äù in coordination with the Registrar‚Äôs Office and an official of the Chinese Communist Party identified in the documents as Chung Huwao; Obstructing registration in the 18-35 age brackets, and over-registering voters in the 35-90 age brackets; Using housing schemes to ‚Äúre-orient beneficiaries‚Äù and log them on the voting roll; Deliberately congesting the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission registration by ‚Äúsecurity personnel and trusted lieutenants to delay the process as advised by Nikuv‚Äù.

Baseball career He began his professional baseball career in 1882 when he joined a club located in Altoona, having played for a local non-professional team the year before. He played for this professional club through the 1883 season, before signing a contract with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association. He made his debut with the Orioles on May 12, 1884, and made his final appearance on June 15. During his time with Baltimore, he played in 13 games, playing mostly as their third baseman, but played three games in the outfield, and one game at shortstop. He had a .192 batting average in 52 at bats, collected ten hits, one triple, and scored one run. After leaving the Orioles, he finished the year playing for a team in Fort Smith, Ohio. The following season, he played for a team in Youngstown, Ohio, followed by a team Meriden, Connecticut for the 1886 season. Later in 1886, he transferred to the Boston Blues when they bought out the Meriden team. After the season, he signed with a St. Louis, Missouri team, which was later moved to Indianapolis. He secured his release from the club shortly thereafter so he could sign with the Duluth, Minnesota club. Death On May 11, 1887, he and two of his Duluth teammates, Bill Barnes and Billy Earle, were paddling in a rowboat on the Mississippi River near La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Barron's Island. It was just after 8 pm, and the trio were approximately 200 yards from the shore, when a passing steamer overturned their boat with its wake, leaving the three clinging to the boat for some time. Barnes and Earle quickly swam to shore, but Ake, who did not know how to swim, hoisted himself on the overturned boat. Ake decided to attempt to swim ashore before Barnes and Earle could secure a rescue skiff, but after a couple strokes, he began to shout for help, slipping under the water, and drowned. Barnes later recalled the way Earle looked at Ake during the incident. Earle, sometimes described as a \\"wierdo\\", as \\"creepy\\", and as having an \\"evil eye\\", had an expression that Barnes never forgot. A thorough search for his body was conducted into the evening, but it was called off. It was thought that since the water was high, the chances of recovering his remains were slim, and it was best to wait until they surfaced later. His widowed mother asked that if his body was recovered, that his remains be delivered to Altoona. On June 4, 1887, fishermen discovered his body when their hooks snagged onto his clothes. Due to the condition of his remains, it was reported that he was immediately buried.

The image was deemed to be \\"potentially illegal content\\" under English law which forbids the possession or creation of indecent photographs of children. The IWF's blacklist are used in web filtering systems such as Cleanfeed. The URL to the image's , which depicts the cover art, was also blacklisted; however thumbnails and the image itself remained accessible. The album cover had been deemed controversial at the time of its release, and was replaced in some markets with an alternate cover image featuring a photo of the band members. The IWF described the image as \\"a potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18\\". Wikipedia's policies state that it does not censor content \\"that some readers consider objectionable or offensive, even exceedingly so\\", although it does remove content that is \\"obviously inappropriate\\", violates other Wikipedia policies, or is illegal in the United States. As well as the direct consequence of censoring the article and image for UK-based readers of the English Wikipedia through the affected ISPs (a censoring that could be circumvented),Investigation by several UK based Wikipedians revealed that the page/image was still available using direct addressing URL parameters, or by using the Wikipedia secure server, as detailed in an internal discussion of the issue at the Administrator's Noticeboard at the time and that the album cover was being made available unfiltered on other major sites including Amazon.co.uk (from which it was later removed), and available for sale in the UK, the action also had some indirect effects on Wikipedia, namely temporarily preventing all editors using said ISPs in the UK from contributing to any page of the encyclopedia, and preventing anonymous edits from these ISPs while the URL remained on the blacklist. This was described by the IWF as unintended \\"collateral damage\\". This was due to the proxies used to access Wikipedia, as Wikipedia implements a blocking policy whereby contributors can be blocked if they vandalise the encyclopedia. Therefore, all vandalism coming from one ISP would be directed through one proxy‚Äîhence one IP‚Äîand all of the ISP's customers using that proxy would be barred from editing. After invoking its appeals procedure and reviewing the situation, the IWF reversed their blacklisting of the page on 9 December 2008, and announced that they would not blacklist other copies of the image hosted outside the UK.  Background  The album art of the Scorpions' album Virgin Killer, featuring a young girl fully nude with a \\"smashed glass\\" effect covering her genitalia, was deemed controversial at the time of its release. The cover was replaced in some markets with an alternate cover image featuring a photo of the band members. RCA Records refused to sell the controversial album cover in the United States.Yasui, Todd. ‚ÄúThe Sign of the Scorpions; The West German Metal Meisters' Tour de Force,‚Äù Washington Post (30 August 1988). The cover was not the only Scorpions' cover which caused controversy however, as the covers for Taken by Force and Lovedrive have also caused controversy with their content. In the United Kingdom, access to illegal content (such as child pornography) was strictly self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses data obtained from the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content to be added to their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act.Internet Watch Foundation ‚Äî R v Bowden British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.\\"Government sets deadline for universal network-level content blocking \\", LINX, 29 May 2006. Retrieved 29 May 2006.\\"Govt sets target for blocking child porn sites \\", The Register, 18 May 2006. Retrieved 29 May 2006.  Addition to IWF blacklist  On 5 December 2008 the Internet Watch Foundation added the Wikipedia URLs for the Virgin Killer article and the description page of the image to its blacklist. After the blacklisting, users of major UK ISPs, including BT, Vodafone, Virgin Media/Tesco.net, Be/O2, EasyNet/UK Online/Sky Broadband, Orange, Demon, and TalkTalk (Opal Telecom), were unable to access the content. Sarah Robertson, director of communications for the IWF, said that the image was rated \\"1 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the least offensive\\". She described the picture as \\"erotic posing with no sexual activity\\". While the image itself has not been flagged as \\"illegal\\", IWF determined it to be a \\"potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18\\". The IWF said they were first notified of the Wikipedia URL on 4 December 2008. This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by U.S.-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. EContent magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared \\"Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed\\", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors \\"favour inclusion in all but the most extreme cases\\". However, according to The Guardian because \\"the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on\\". Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that \\"We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win\\", before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly \\"given that you can go into HMV and buy a copy on the high street\\". On 9 December 2008 the IWF reversed its blacklist of the Wikipedia pages on the basis of the \\"contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability\\".  Effects on Wikipedia  Users attempting to access the Virgin Killer article or image were met with pseudo-404 errors or other messages. The blacklisting of Virgin Killer also caused other inadvertent issues for Wikipedia users in the United Kingdom. Usually most Internet users have a unique IP address visible to websites. However, as a result of ISPs using the IWF blacklist implemented through Cleanfeed technology, traffic to Wikipedia via those affected ISPs was then routed through a small number of proxy servers. This caused problems for users of the site. Since Wikipedia allows users to anonymously edit its encyclopaedia articles, these individuals are identified only through their IP addresses, which are used to selectively block users who vandalise the site or otherwise break its rules. The proxy filtering makes it impossible to uniquely distinguish users, and to prevent vandalism Wikipedia \\"instituted a blanket ban on anonymous edits from the six ISPs, which account for 95% of British residential internet users\\". This had the immediate effect of requiring nearly all registered users in the UK to request the lifting of on their accounts before they could edit again, and the de facto permanent effect of barring any contribution from people without , who contribute merely under an IP address and not a user name. The MediaWiki software that Wikipedia runs on can interpret X-Forwarded-For (XFF) headers, allowing Wikipedia to identify a user's main IP address rather than the proxy IP address, allowing the ability to block proxy users individually by their client's IP rather than the proxy server IP (avoiding the need to block the whole proxy due to the actions of a single user). However, none of the ISPs subscribing to this system pass XFF information to Wikipedia, having the impact of reversing the normal method of identification and blocking on Wikipedia. IP addresses assumed to be assigned to an individual person or organisation were assigned instead to millions of people and thousands of registered editors. Wikipedia servers saw them all as the IP of the proxy rather than each as the IP of their own machine. Due to erroneous use of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and other routing technology to redirect the connections to the filtering proxies, users of some networks were temporarily prevented from accessing or editing any content hosted by Wikimedia, a problem reminiscent of Pakistan's accidental blocking of YouTube for much of the world instead of only their own citizens.  Responses  On 7 December 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organisation which supports Wikipedia, issued a press release about the blacklisting of their sites by the IWF stating that they had \\"no reason to believe the article, or the image contained in the article, has been held to be illegal in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world\\", and noting that not just the image but the article itself had been blocked. On 9 December 2008, Jimmy Wales, co- founder of Wikipedia, who holds the \\"community founder seat\\" on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, told the UK's Channel 4 News that he had briefly considered legal action. After the block had been removed, Mike Godwin, general counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation, stated \\"there is still plenty to be troubled by in the operations of the Internet Watch Foundation and its blacklist\\". On 9 December 2008, the IWF rescinded the block, issuing the following statement:  Aftermath  The incident was commented in some countries implementing or considering to implement Internet filtering or censorship plans. In Australia, Electronic Frontiers Australia vice-chairman Colin Jacobs said that \\"[the] incident in Britain, in which virtually the entire country was unable to edit Wikipedia because the country's Internet Watch Foundation had blacklisted a single image on the site, illustrated the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering\\". The Sydney Morning Herald has commented that \\"Ironically, the banning of the image has only made it visible to more people as news sites publicise the issue and the image spreads across sites other than Wikipedia.\\" an example of the Streisand effect. At the time of the incident Amazon US were also displaying the image on their site and the IWF stated that it \\"might yet add Amazon US to its list of 'blocked' sites for hosting the picture\\"; however, Amazon subsequently took the decision to remove the image from their site.: \\"However Amazon US no longer risks being blocked under IWF's rulings. The image, as an album cover, had been on its site earlier this week, but has now been removed, apparently on the site's own initiative.\\" In an impact study preparing a bill dealing with cybercrime, the Cabinet of France listed the Virgin Killer block as an example of indiscriminate filtering. The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticised the IWF's reasoning:Internet Censors Must Be Accountable For The Things They Break, , Peter Eckersley, 9 December 2008 The IWF continues to assert that the image is indeed child porn, and asserts that the image would be blocked if it were on a British server.Doctorow, Cory. ‚ÄúHow to make child-porn blocks safe for the internet‚Äù , The Guardian (16 December 2008).

Balachander, starring Shruti, Rahman, Prakash Raj, Geetha, Renuka, and Fathima Babu. The music composition is by Deva. The film was co-produced by Gramco Films. The film was among 1996 Deepavali releases. Plot Chellammaa (Geetha), a singer, is wedded to a chauvinistic, sadistic industrialist named Prakash (Prakash Raj). She is unable to beget a child and hence is the target of hurting words from Prakash and his mother. When he prohibits her from singing, it is the last straw for her, and they divorce. Prakash marries Karpagam (Renuka), a doormat wife, while Chellammaa stays single, with a cook named Kokila (newsreader Fathima Babu in her first movie appearance) around to help her. Kalki (Shruti) works in an ad agency and is relentlessly pursued by coworker and model Paranjothi (Rahman). She not only rejects him but also debunks love and sentiments. Chellammaa becomes friends with Kalki after a few encounters, and Kalki moves in as a paying guest. However, she strikes up a friendship with Prakash, and as the result of an affair with him, she ends up bearing his child. Kalki makes him understand what he was doing to his wife by treating him like the way he treats his wife. During the time of delivery, Karpagam, with her lawyer, threatens Prakash that she is going to divorce him. However, upon realizing the mistakes that he did, he asks sorry to Karpagam and asks for a chance to change himself. She agrees with a condition not to hurt Kalki's child and also to live with Kalki. Prakash agrees to both the conditions. When they meet Kalki and inform this, Kalki says that she does not want to live with them as well as she is not ready to give the child to them. Before delivery, she meets Chellamma and informs that she did live with Prakash to teach him a lesson and had a child just for Chellamma and leaves the child with Chellamma after delivery. After that, the society is not ready to accept her, so she goes to Paranjothi, who is waiting for her and confesses her love for him.

The population was 23,261 at the 2010 census, up from 18,681 at the 2000 census. The central area of the city was originally known as Mound City; its eastern half was originally the unincorporated community of Bryn Mawr. History In the late 1800s, Loma Linda began as a development of tourist halls called Mound City, as encouraged by railroad companies. Shops and cottages were built, but the project would later fail. During the late 1890s, a group of businessmen and physicians from Los Angeles bought the Mound City Hotel and reopened it as a convalescent home and health resort. They called it Loma Linda, meaning ‚ÄúBeautiful Hill‚Äù in Spanish. The city was incorporated in 1970. In 1969, San Timoteo Creek overflowed its banks, inundating two-thirds of Loma Linda. Many of the bridges over the creek washed away, and Loma Linda Academy was completely flooded. In 2010, the creek again flooded parts of Loma Linda. Loma Linda is twinned with Manipal, India, and Libertador San Martin, Argentina, as its sister cities. Geography Loma Linda is located in southwestern San Bernardino County and is considered part of the Inland Empire. It is bordered on the north by the city of San Bernardino, on the east by Redlands, on the west by Colton, and on the south by Riverside County. An area of unincorporated territory in Riverside County separates Loma Linda from the city of Moreno Valley to the south. The remnants of Bryn Mawr, an unincorporated community formerly located between Loma Linda and Redlands, was annexed by the city in 2008. Loma Linda is in the southern San Bernardino Valley. The southern third of the city is known as the South Hills; this rugged and hilly area at the northwestern end of the Badlands is a city-owned open space reserve protected by a local initiative. San Timoteo Creek flows from southeast to northwest through the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , 99.99% of it land. =Water contamination and air pollution= Ground water near Loma Linda is contaminated by a plume of the chemical perchlorate which was used in the manufacturing of solid rocket fuel. This chemical was also formerly (decades ago and in very small amounts) prescribed by physicians to control the overactive thyroid glands of certain patients. Attempts to quantify the effects of low-level exposure to perchlorate have met with resistance from environmental (and other) activists. A nearby plant operated by Lockheed Aerospace has been implicated in the improper disposal of the rocket fuel ingredient, which leached into the ground water northeast of Loma Linda. Loma Linda's municipal water supply, nevertheless, has been unaffected by the plume, primarily because Lockheed Martin installed a $19 million treatment plant in 2010 to remove both perchlorate and trichloroethylene from water after pumping it from the aquifer. Demographics =2010= At the 2010 Census, Loma Linda had a population of 23,261. The population density was 3,094.3 people per square mile (1,194.7/km).

The main tower of the center was built in 1967 and is 11 stories high. Currently, the hospital is building two new hospital towers. It is one of the tallest buildings in the Inland Empire. Because of its height and white coloration, it is possible to view the main hospital building from various locations around the San Bernardino valley and mountains. Loma Linda University Medical Center made international news on October 26, 1984, when Dr. Leonard L Bailey transplanted a baboon heart into Baby Fae, an infant born with a severe heart defect known as hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Baby Fae died a few weeks later; however, this effort led to the successful infant heart transplant program, with transplantation of human-to-human infant transplants. LLUMC is home to the Venom E.R., which specializes in snake bites. In 2014, LLUMC was ranked the 14th best hospital in California by the U.S. News & World Report. right Loma Linda University Loma Linda University Medical Center is the teaching hospital for Loma Linda University, which includes schools of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, allied health, religion, public health, and behavioral health. Children's hospital Loma Linda University Children's Hospital is the sole children's hospital for almost 1.3 million of California's youth (San Bernardino, Riverside, Inyo, and Mono Counties). With over 275 beds just for children, the American Board of Surgeons has designated the Children's Hospital as a Level 1 Trauma Center, providing the highest level of trauma care within the Inland Empire four-county area. Each year, more than 15,000 children stay at the hospital and over 130,000 children visit the hospital for ambulatory care. The only medical facility in the Inland Empire specializing in the care of children, Children's Hospital transports over 1,100 critically ill or injured children each year from surrounding hospitals. Proton treatment and research center The James M. Slater Proton Treatment and Research Center at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) offers proton therapy treatments for prostate, lung, brain and other types of cancers. This center is the nation's first hospital-based proton treatment center. Since its opening in 1990 over 14,500 patients have been treated. Through a multidisciplinary approach, teams of experts including radiation oncologists, nurses, technicians and staff treat patients with care to ensure they experience fewer side effects and better outcomes with the power and precision of proton therapy. Using high- energy protons for medical treatment was first proposed in 1946. Protons were first used to treat patients with certain cancers less than 10 years later. Research and laboratory applications increased rapidly in the next three decades. It was not until the opening of the James M. Slater Proton Treatment and Research Center at Loma Linda University Medical Center in 1990, however, that the full benefits of proton treatment could be offered to patients with a wide variety of cancers. The synchrotron was invented in the 1950s to produce higher-energy particles for studying subnuclear matter. Much of that work was done at the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). Fermilab physicists and engineers built the proton accelerator that exists at Loma Linda University Medical Center today. LLUMC's accelerator is the world's smallest variable-energy proton synchrotron. It is designed to deliver a beam of energy sufficient to reach the deepest tumors in patients. Surgical hospital In May 2008, it was announced that LLUMC had been in talks since December and had finalized a buyout of the 28-bed California Heart and Surgical Center located approximately two miles east of the main campus on the border of Loma Linda and Redlands, California. This was a marked departure of their previous position of opposition to the facility when it was first proposed in 2005. The Heart and Surgical Center would have been a for-profit facility while the Loma Linda is a non-profit facility and it was feared by area hospitals, including Loma Linda, that the Heart and Surgical Center would take all the paying patients. However, Loma Linda finalized the construction and furnishing of the center and in January 2009, they received state approval to open and begin operations as Loma Linda University Heart & Surgical Hospital. The daVinci Robot that was operated at the Medical Center to perform minimally invasive robotic surgeries was moved to the Surgical Hospital. The hospital is now known as Loma Linda University Surgical Hospital, when heart operations were moved to the main medical center. Medicare lawsuits In 2004, Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center paid 2.2 million dollars to settle a federal lawsuit that the organization had over-billed federal health insurance programs. The lawsuit alleged that its billing service had prepared two different cost reports, one for internal use and an inflated one to bill Medicare. In 2005, a group of 20 physician corporations paid to settle a federal lawsuit over fraudulent Medicare billings reviewed under the Physicians at Teaching Hospitals (PaTH) initiative. The lawsuit alleged that the hospital had been billing Medicare for procedures done by residents and interns as if they had been done by the attending physicians. Seismic upgrade project The seismic upgrade project, as of August 9th, 2019. The main hospital building is currently undergoing a seismic upgrade project.

The office of the Gonfalonier of the Church was originally intended to function as its bearer of the Holy See.Storia della Bandiera dello Stato della Citt√† del Vaticano Description Gonfalone with St. Peter and St. Paul Gonfalone of Innocent III The insignia was made of red cloth decorated, initially, with the image of St. Peter and occasionally later with St. Paul as well. Pope Innocent III (1198‚Äì1216) replaced these with the emblem of crossed keys surmounted by a white cross. Pope Boniface VIII (1294‚Äì1303) established the final form: a cloth of crimson silk, covered with numerous six-pointed stars embroidered in gold, bearing the image of the crossed keys surmounted by a canopy or veil bearing a gold tassel at either end. The banner was attached to a long golden rod and followed the pope in his travels, including solemn religious and civil processions (such as Corpus Christi). History The Vexillum of Saint Peter came into use under Pope Alexander II during a critical period in the Investiture Controversy. Though the Holy Roman Emperor refused to recognise papal authority at the time, Alexander sought to strengthen his image via symbolic acts, such as granting the banner of St. Peter and a blessing to kings who in return offered themselves as his vassals, such as William the Conqueror before the Norman invasion. The banner was used for the highest- level investiture ceremonies, implying the Papacy's authority over temporal lords. Such banners were also present in the Crusades and at the battle of Lepanto. Custody of the Vexillum of the Holy Roman Church was entrusted to a high-ranking figure, who assumed the title of Gonfaloniere or Vessillifero di Santa Romana Chiesa (Gonfalonier of the Holy Roman Church). It was the highest role the pope could grant to a layman, as demonstrated by several of its holders having been kings. Kingly holders included James II of Aragon (1267-1327, king of Sardinia and Corsica, from Pope Boniface VIII) and Ladislaus of Naples (1376‚Äì1414, king of Naples, Sicily and Hungary, by Pope Innocent VII). It was also granted to *Louis XI of France whilst Dauphin (by Pope Eugenius IV) *Gianfrancesco Gonzaga marquess of Mantua (by Pope Julius II) *Odoardo I Farnese, fifth duke of Parma and Piacenza, from Pope Gregory XV (1621‚Äì1623) *Carlo Barberini by his brother Pope Urban VIII (1623‚Äì1644) *Torquato Conti, duke of Guadagnolo, by Urban VIII after Carlo's death in 1630 Pope Innocent XI (1676‚Äì1689) made the post hereditary and conferred it on marquess Giovanni Battista Naro. When the Naro family died out, it then passed to the patrician Montoros. To confirm the office's importance Pope Clement XI (1700‚Äì1721) ordered that its holder had to be escorted, in solemn procession, by the captains of the Cavalleggeri (Papal light cavalry). In 1801, Pope Pius VII, after the Cavalleggeri were dissolved, replaced them by instituting a new body, the Noble Pontifical Guard, with the standard-bearer acting as its captain with the rank of Tenente Generale. Finally, Pope Pius IX ordered that the office-holder was to be accorded a distinctive special collar showing the word Vexillifer and that the holder was always a member of the Papal court.

Nothing is known about his life or family but eight fragments of his poetry on Canute have been preserved. While Hallvar√∞r's poetry resembles that of Canute's other poets in many respects it is unusual in its heavy use of pagan imagery. Extant fragments Six fragments of poetry by Hallvar√∞r are quoted in the Sk√°ldskaparm√°l section of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda. One additional fragment is quoted in Kn√Ωtlinga saga and one in Heimskringla and kings' sagas derived from it. In Finnur J√≥nsson's complete edition of skaldic poetry the fragments are conjectured to be all from the same poem, a Kn√∫tsdr√°pa (\\"Lay of Canute\\"), and arranged in a suggested order.Eysteinn Bj√∂rnsson. The first complete English translation was published by Roberta Frank in 1994.Frank 1994:119-121. The extant fragments are mainly about Canute's expedition to England and his becoming king there in 1015-1016.Faulkes 1998:180. Apart from what little can be conjectured from this, nothing is known about the poet's life or origin. Finnur J√≥nsson believed he became one of Canute's court poets after the king's conquest of Norway in 1028.Finnur J√≥nsson 1920:601; Hallvar√∞r H√°reksblese. Om denne digters herkomst og liv vides intet. Han har opholdt sig hos kong Knud i England, efter at denne havde erobret Norge i 1028, han tiltaler kongen i versene. Af hans Kn√∫tsdr√°pa (navnet findes i Fms. XI, 187), er endel vers bevarede (Skj. digtn. B I, 293-94). De handler om Knuds tog til England i 1016, om hans store magt, krigerske f√¶rd og lykke i temmelig st√¶rke, men egenlig ikke originale udtryk: \\"Knud v√¶rger sit land, som alverdens herre bj√¶rgenes herlige sal\\" er omkv√¶det; det minder om Gunnlaugs stef i A√∞alsteins dr. Der er ikke meget karakteristisk ved disse vers; de er i formel henseende ret gode. S√¶rlig kan vi l√¶gge m√¶rke til, at vi hos Hallvar√∞r finder en - ny - omskrivning for brystet, h√¶ntet fra den nye tro. Han kalder nemlig brynjen for en \\"b√∂nnens skibs (brystets) bark\\". Dette er √•benbart en n√Ωgj√∂rving. Hallvar√∞r and other poets The refrain of Hallvar√∞r's Kn√∫tsdr√°pa compares Kn√∫tr's role on earth to that of the Christian God in Heaven. :Kn√∫tr verr j√∂r√∞ sem √≠tran :alls dr√≥ttinn sal fjalla. :Cnut protects the land as the Lord of all [does] the splendid hall of the mountains [Heaven]. Hallvar√∞r's refrain is very similar to that composed by his fellow poet, √û√≥rarinn loftunga, who also compared the roles of Canute and God in his H√∂fu√∞lausn. It is also reminiscent of the refrain of Gunnlaugr Wormtongue's poem about king Ethelred and, to a lesser extent, to those in √û√≥rarinn loftunga's T√∏gdr√°pa and Sighvatr √û√≥r√∞arson's Kn√∫tsdr√°pa, both about King Canute.Frank 1994:116. Like Canute's other skalds, Hallvar√∞r emphasizes Canute's Danish ancestry and how his rule benefits Danish interests.Frank 1994:109-111. He, however, differs somewhat from the other poets in describing Canute with imagery derived from Norse mythology, including references to valkyries, giants, the Midgard Serpent and the World Tree. In his kennings, he even refers to Canute with the names of pagan gods.Frank 1994:121. Critical reception Finnur J√≥nsson described Hallvar√∞r's poetic expressions as strong but not very original and the surviving verses as formally quite good but not very individual in character. Despite this, he noted that one of Hallvar√∞r's poems has an apparently new kenning for the breast (as seat of emotion and thought), based on the new religion; \\"the ship of prayer\\". Roberta Frank is more positive, describing Hallvar√∞r's poetry as \\"skaldic verse at its richest and most allusive, a startling blend of Christian and pagan imagery like that carved on the Gosforth cross.\\"Frank 1994:121.

It lies approximately 2.5 km south east of the village of Beddgelert and just over 1 km from the rather more famous mountain Cnicht. It is a rugged hill with widespread rock outcrops and cliffs. A small lake, Llyn yr Arddu, is located on the flanks of the mountain. The recognised summit is at 388m to the South of the hill, but the highest point, named Cerrig-y-Myllt on only the most detailed UK Ordnance Survey mapping, is at 463m above the two small lakes to the North of the hill. The craggy nature of the hill is due to the presence of lavas and tuffs (volcanic ash deposits) dating from the Ordovician period when Snowdonia was characterised by numerous volcanic eruptions; Yr Arddu is a particularly good location to see the record of Ordovician volcanism. The Yr Arddu Tuffs may be the earliest eruptive phase of the Lower Rhyolitic Tuff Formation. The whole hill is a site of special scientific interest designated by the Countryside Council for Wales. Yr Arddu is commonly approached by a footpath leaving the minor road that links Nantmor to Nant Gwynant running along the valley of Blaen Nanmor, but the final 0.5 km has no paths marked on UK Ordnance Survey mapping. However, a marked path runs South East from Nantmor Mountain Centre at Gelli-Iago. From this an intermittent rough path runs from West of Clogwyn Coch up to the two small lakes.

This included knife-armed cavalry, lancers' pages and mounted crossbowmen. Later, cavalleggeri became a subsidiary arm of the gendarmerie. In 1498, Louis XII of France gave this name to his mounted companies, forming a sort of mounted infantry, and this special body continued until 1570. In this era Henry IV of France formed a company of chevau-l√©gers, well-educated and called ordinance since it was used as the king's guard. Other Italian states and communal militias created cavalleggeri units. In the Florentine Republic it was established that 500 mounted crossbowmen would be regularly enlisted, with the option of arming 10% of them with lances. These were also known as drappelli and were formed into bands, each of which was made up of 50 cavalleggeri and commanded by a condotiere. After 1600 this specialist cavalry was more and more streamlined and made more practical in the age of gunpowder. Such units were split up to increase numbers in heavy cavalry units, or turned into such units themselves. The cavalleggeri of this era were armed with carbines or pistols. In 1799, new cavalleggeri/chevau-l√©gers units were created, and under Napoleon these were once again armed with lances. Bibliography * Stato Maggiore Esercito - Ufficio Storico. Ezio Cecchini.

He graduated from Columbia College Chicago with a degree in marketing communications. Dore started performing in 1989 and currently lives in Pasadena with his wife Stefane Zamorano. Career = Comedy = Dore has made appearances on late-night television on shows such as ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, CBS's The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, and NBC's Late Friday. He was the lead performer in a Comedy Central Presents half-hour special on April 9, 2004, and Comedy Central's Citizen Jimmy, a one-hour stand-up special which was chosen \\"Best of 2008\\" by iTunes. He was a writer‚Äìperformer for the off- Broadway hit The Marijuana-Logues. He has also performed at Just for Laughs in Montreal, the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the Amsterdam Comedy Festival, and for U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Dore had a role in the 2008 documentary film Super High Me and hosted the podcast Comedy And Everything Else with his wife Stefane Zamorano and previously with Todd Glass, who departed from the show in late 2009. Much of his material is focused on the corporate news media, social criticism, and politics. He also hosts his monthly show, Left, Right & Ridiculous, at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Hollywood. Dore's first book, Your Country Is Just Not That Into You, was published in 2014. A comedy special, Sentenced to Live, was released on October 6, 2015. = The Jimmy Dore Show = In June 2009, he began producing The Jimmy Dore Show, a weekly one-hour comedic look at the news, which originates at KPFK 90.7 FM Los Angeles, airs nationally on the Pacifica Radio Network. It aired online on TYT Network from 2009 to 2019. Dore appeared as a frequent guest host on Current TV's political commentary show The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur. Dore continued working with Uygur on The Young Turks as it became an on-line network. In July 2017, Dore began hosting his own show on the network called \\"Aggressive Progressives.\\" An article published in CNN described Dore's show as \\"a far-left YouTube channel that peddles conspiracy theories, such as the idea that Syrian chemical weapons attacks are hoaxes\\". Dore responded by saying of his show that, \\"We actually debunk conspiracy theories like the one that says Assad gassed his own people\\". In September 2019, the investigative journalism site Bellingcat reported that Dore had received $2,500 from The Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees in 2017, described by Bellingcat as a pro-Assad lobby group. That same year, Dore argued that the chemical weapons attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhun was likely to have been a \\"false flag,\\" orchestrated by groups opposed to Bashar al-Assad. A joint report by the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons stated that the Syrian government was responsible for the attack. Dore responded by retweeting criticism of claims of biased reporting. Dore supported Bernie Sanders' campaign in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, being called \\"Sanders-obsessed\\" by The Washington Post. He was critical of Senator Elizabeth Warren for not defending Sanders in the primaries. Dore later asserted that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be worse for progressives and for the United States than a Donald Trump presidency, saying \\"don't freak out about a Donald Trump presidency! I think, in fact, my theory is that it's even better for progressives in the short- term, meaning in the two-year term, and in four years for sure.\\" A Washington Post article in January 2017 stated that since the presidential election, Dore had \\"lit into Democrats for blaming hackers for their loss, raised doubts about the credibility of intelligence agencies, and seen the heavy hand of war hawks hyping the Russia connection to destabilize Europe and the Middle East.\\" Dore has been a staunch critic of the Special Counsel investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.Perlroth, Nicole (June 15, 2020). \\"A Conspiracy Made in America May Have Been Spread by Russia\\". The New York Times. In May 2017, Dore discussed conspiracy theories over the murder of Seth Rich and questioned statements by law enforcement and Rich's family. Dore cited a retracted Fox News story to substantiate his claims, and continued to insist that there were ‚Äúa lot of red flags‚Äù and there ‚Äúis probably something more to this story‚Äù including after the Fox News retraction. Dore has also expressed doubt in the official narrative of the 9/11 attacks, saying \\"I don't know what happened. I know what didn't happen. What didn't happen is what the government said happened.\\" On April 13, 2019, during a livestream, Dore officially announced his departure from The Young Turks Network, citing a desire to focus on his own show and his live performances. Later that evening, his former boss, Cenk Uygur, confirmed his departure on Twitter. In a July 2020 video, Dore erroneously said Joe Biden \\"hosted a black face affair with a bunch of rich white people\\" before Dore showed an altered clip which darkened the face of black singer Jerome Powell.

It is a mere east of Washington, D.C. Many of its white oaks and tulip poplars are more than three feet in diameter and soar more than before branching. The \\"South Woods\\" were designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974. Belt Woods has been owned and protected by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources since the 1980s. Some at the site are designated a Natural Environment Area (NEA) and another are designated a Heritage Conservation Fund (HCF) site. Thus are protected in total. Within this area, the Maryland General Assembly has designated ‚Äî within the NEA and within the HCF ‚Äî as a special Maryland Wildland.‚ÄúDNR Owned Land Acreage Report, 2008‚Äù ; Maryland Department of Natural Resources. History Belt Woods is part of the former farm of semi- reclusive banker and gentleman farmer, Seton Belt (1870‚Äì1959). A bird breeding census first surveyed the tract in 1947; the density of Forest Interior Dwelling Species (FIDS) was then found to be 300 pairs/100 acres (1300 m¬≤ per pair). Belt was descendent from 17th-century settlers in Prince George's County and owned 3,200 acres on six farms including these woods. Belt was treasurer of St. Barnabas' Episcopal Church, Leeland, Maryland and when he drafted his will in 1944, he \\"stipulated that the trees on his home farm should never be cut down and his 624-acre home farm never sold.\\" He specified his other holdings should be sold, with the proceeds placed in a trust to benefit St. Barnabas. In 1976, the trustees petitioned the court and were granted a reinterpretation of the will that permitted them to sell and log the farm. The oaks of the \\"North Woods\\", were logged in 1981 by a New Jersey firm. They harvested 563 old-growth oak and tulip trees for veneer. Tom Horton, in his book Bay Country (1987), tells how this happened: > The bank entrusted with administering Seton Belt's estate, and the church to > which he left his goods, found that the forest earned the highest accolades > not just from naturalists and woodland songbirds. \\"Veneer quality\\", eager > buyers from the world's leading timber concerns adjudged the massive, knot- > free, straight trunks of the oaks. Debarked, steamed until soft, then sliced > and peeled on huge machines into sheets just 1/4-inch thick, just a few of > the Beltwoods giants would decorate acres of executive conference-room walls > in warm wood tones. The church said it needed the money over and above the > $10 million that old Belt had left it to build an urban home for the > elderly. With the bank, it broke the will in court, and half the mighty > Beltwoods fell to the chainsaw ... The forester hired by the bank explained > to me his satisfaction when the veneer deal went through. From the > standpoint of annual, new cellulose production, he said, the old oaks were > well into the area of diminishing returns, even though they might live > another century or two. \\"The only thing left for that particular stand of > trees to do was to die and fall over\\", he saidHorton, Tom (1987), Bay > Country, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, pg 19. This event served as a wakeup call to conservationists and an 18-year legal battle ensued between them and the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. In 1984, the state of Maryland, with partners, purchased including the \\"South Woods\\", designating them the Belt Woods Natural Environmental Area. Impending residential development necessitated the state's purchase of an additional in 1997 ‚Äî known as the Belt Woods Heritage Conservation Fund site. The HCF site, which consists of the former \\"North\\" and \\"Central Woods\\" (now young forest and fields), buffers the old growth forest and forestalls further development. In all, some are protected at the site, of which most (610 acres) were designated by the Maryland General Assembly in October 1997 as the Belt Woods Wildland. Access to Belt Woods is limited to scientific study. Ecology =Songbirds= Belt Woods lies within the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. It consists of a mosaic of small fields and woodlands and is a critical nesting area for neotropical songbirds. The density of birds breeding there is among the highest observed on the east coast. Unusually high densities of FIDS birds prevail. In 1989, the breeding bird census, which uses a territory mapping method, measured a density of more than 200 pairs/100 acres (40 ha) of FIDS, attributable largely to high densities of wood thrush and red-eyed vireo. Nine other species of FIDS birds regularly breed there, including the Kentucky warbler. =Flora= The canopy of the mesic upland hardwood forest at Belt Woods is dominated by tulip poplar and white oak.

He was initially known as studio director of the Australian TV pop show Countdown from 1975 to 1977. During this period, he directed several music videos (promotional film clips) made especially for Countdown, including the original clips for the AC/DC hits \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\" and \\"Jailbreak\\".http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/of-the-most-amazing- acdc-moments/story-e6frfn09-1226885147097 His innovative and award-winning Countdown video for Supernaut's \\"I Like It Both Ways\\" gave viewers an early taste of visual effects in music videos. These were achieved without the benefit of (yet to be invented) high-end CGI, but improvised with clever use of video feed-back by pointing the cameras at monitors to create wildly looping, distortion effects. With its blend of live action and 2D visual imagery, the award-winning video was an early glimpse of the rapid advances that lay ahead. In addition to the Countdown live performances, Drane independently produced and directed many Australian music videos during the 70s (Skyhooks, John Paul Young, Cold Chisel, Little River Band, Marcia Hines) and full concerts by local and international artists. In 1978 he produced and directed the independent music documentary, 'Australian Music to the World', based on the original radio series by Vince Lovegrove. Filmed worldwide, the program featured interviews and performances by artists including AC/DC (live in Atlanta), Peter Allen, Helen Reddy and the Little River Band. The following year Drane produced and directed the documentary special \\"The Prophecies of Nostradamus\\" for Australian Seven television network. Hosted by actor, John Waters, the program set a ratings record, with unprecedented reaction the following day, prompting the network to schedule a repeat run two weeks later. This program was sold to Warner Bros. in the United States in 1980. Repackaged for worldwide release, it was narrated by Orson Welles and titled The Man Who Saw Tomorrow. Throughout his lengthy career Paul Drane has maintained his passion for music, and in particular live music on television. This has given rise to classic televised concerts from artists including Split Enz, INXS, and Paul Kelly, and iconic musical moments such as Stevie Wright's \\"Evie\\" at the Sydney Opera House. Since 2005, Drane has directed RocKwiz for SBS One and continues to make music videos and television content.

Many of his works depict scenes from Odsherred in the northwest of Zealand. He is considered to be a member of the group of artists known as the Odsherred Painters, especially as he joined them in forming Corner. Hartz' earlier portraits, landscapes and still lifes were characterised by thick layers of paint. With time, the human form disappeared as his style became more sketchy. The once vivid colours were increasingly thinned down. Ultimately he reverted just to drawings and watercolours. Hertz died on 22 September 1987 in Nyk√∏bing Sj√¶lland.

Indeed, the summit observatory, which operated from 1883 to 1904, reported that snow survived on the north-east cliffs through more years than it vanished.Martin Moran, Scotland‚Äôs Winter Mountains, More recently, additional and methodical field study on the subject has been carried out by others, most notably by ecologist Dr Adam Watson. Most of this work concentrated on the mountains of north-east Scotland (in particular, the Cairngorms), but more recent observations by him and others has shed light on various locations throughout Scotland where long-lying snow persists. The available information systematically gathered by observers over the last 50 years or so, and greatly increased since the 1990s, has built up a level of knowledge that points to Scotland‚Äôs snow patches being now amongst the best documented in the world.  General locations  Aonach M√≤r's protalus snow- patch on 1 October 2007. This patch sits on solid bedrock and melts more quickly than other patches because of water running underneath. There are many locations on the Scottish mountains where snow lies regularly into July, August and even September, but the two main areas where snow virtually always lies longer than anywhere else are the Cairngorms and the Lochaber mountains. These areas contain all of Scotland's mountains in excess of , including Ben Nevis. In some years snow can persist all summer, in some locations lasting through to the next winter. In 2015 some 73 patches were still present in late November at a time when the next winter's snows had started accumulating. The last time so many patches had survived all year was 1994. Other locations where snow has been known to survive: * Creag Meagaidh hills, survived in 1994 and 2015 * Glen Affric/Strathfarrar hills, usually melts mid/late August but survivals have been noted on Sgurr na Lapaich, An Riabhachan and Toll Creagach as recently as 2015. * Ben Wyvis, normally melts July/August, though survival has been noted (A Watson) * Grey Corries, normally survives until July/August, has survived at least once on Stob Coire Easain (A Watson) and in 2015 on Stob Coire an Laoigh. * Ben Alder range. Snow has survived at Geal-Charn on multiple occasions, most recently in 2015. Starting in 2009, and for 120 months consecutively, someone has been able to find snow for skiing somewhere in Scotland. The Cairngorms Scotland's most durable snow patch, Garbh Choire M√≤r, Braeriach, 8 August 2008 As well as containing five of the highest mountains in the United Kingdom, the Cairngorms is the range where snow persists longest, and in more locations, than anywhere else in the UK.

As already noted, Ben Nevis has long been known to hold snow late into the year. However, historical reports from the 19th century and early 20th century of snow being ever present on the mountain are virtually impossible to substantiate, so must remain speculative. Nevertheless, what is certainly true is that snow often persists from one winter to the next. Analysis of Ben Nevis's snow is not as comprehensive as that of the Cairngorms, but recent observations show that Ben Nevis has been snow-free only once since 2006 (in 2017). The largest patch, at Observatory Gully, sits at an altitude of around . The slightly lower patch at Point 5 gully has also been known to survive from one winter to the next.

Most became prominent as leaders within the Catholic Church. They were mixed-race children of Mary Eliza Smith, a mulatto slave, and her common-law husband, Michael Morris Healy, an Irish Catholic immigrant from County Roscommon. He became a wealthy cotton planter in Jones County. Georgia prohibited slaves from being educated. As Healy was determined to provide a future for his children, he sent them North for their educations, as did some other wealthy planters with mixed-race children. Majority white in ancestry, the children varied in appearance. They were baptized and educated as Catholic in the North, and gained opportunities as Irish Catholics. Most of the sons first attended Quaker boarding schools in New York and New Jersey before transferring to a Catholic school in Massachusetts. All but the fifth son graduated from college. James, Patrick and Sherwood Healy all undertook graduate studies at the in Paris, and the latter two earned doctorates there. The three daughters were educated at long- established Catholic convent schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Of the nine children who lived to adulthood, three of the sons became ordained Catholic priests and educators, one died at 21, and all three daughters became nuns. (One of the daughters later left the order, married an Irish immigrant, and had a son). Michael Healy, the fifth child, entered maritime service. Since the late 20th century, especially, their achievements have been recognized as \\"firsts\\" for people of known African-American descent. James Augustine Healy became the first American bishop of African-American descent, Patrick Francis Healy was president of Georgetown College, and Eliza Healy attained the rank of Mother Superior in Vermont, the first person of African-American descent to reach this position. Michael Healy had a 20-year career with the United States Revenue Cutter Service. Today he is noted as the first person of African- American descent to command a federal ship. Three of the Healy children have been individually honored by the naming of various buildings, awards, and a ship for them. The former site of the Healy family's plantation near Macon, Georgia is now called River North. It was developed in 1973 by Robert J. Adams Jr. and includes the Healy Point Country Club. A memorial stone honoring the Healy Family was placed in the 1,600 acre subdivision that still stands today.James O'Toole, \\"Passing Free: Black in the South, Irish in the North, the Healys Slipped the Bonds of Race in Civil War America\\", Boston College Magazine, Summer 2003, accessed April 9, 2010 Under slave law and the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, adopted in Virginia in the 17th century, the children were legally slaves, as they were born to a slave mother. They were classified on the census as mulatto; the US census until 1930 acknowledged mixed race. Their lives have intrigued historians, sociologists, and commentators because of the Healys' high achievements and their immigrant and ethnic complexity.A.D.

He emigrated to the United States, possibly by way of Canada, arriving in 1818. Through good fortune in a Georgia land lottery and later acquisitions, he eventually acquired more than of good \\"bottomland\\" near the Ocmulgee River in Jones County, across the river from the market town of Macon.

Foley, Bishop Healy: Beloved Outcaste, Farrar, Strauss & Geroux, 1954, p. 8. Note: Foley says that Eliza was a mulatto slave born in Georgia. slaves for his labor-intensive enterprise. Among these was a 16-year-old girl named Mary Eliza (whose surname has been recorded both as Smith and Clark), whom he took as his common-law wife in 1829, when he was age 33.Eileen A. Sullivan, \\"Review: Look away, Dixieland\\", of David T. Gleeson, The Irish in the South 1815 - 1877, Irish Literary Supplement, September 22, 2002, carried on Highbeam Research, accessed February 7, 2011 Mary Eliza Smith/Clark, has been described in various accounts as \\"slave\\" and \\"former slave\\", and as mulatto and African American (which includes mixed-race). In the South, children born to slave women had the legal status of slaves, regardless of their paternity, because of the principle in slave law of partus sequitur ventrem, which was adopted in the late 17th century throughout the South. They were legally slaves, regardless of their ancestry or religion. As shorthand mixed-race slaves were sometimes classified as black, but the term \\"mulatto\\", which recognized mixed race, was also used in census records for both slaves and free persons. This term was used in the US Census until 1930. In Louisiana, free people of color formed a third class in the colonial era, and their descendants have become known as Louisiana creoles. These free mixed-race people gained education and property before the American Civil War, sometimes as a result of settlements on women and children in the system of pla√ßage. The union of Michael Morris and Mary Eliza Healy was relatively formalized; unions were common between white men and mixed-race or black women. He was not the only white man to take an African-American wife or concubine and to have the wealth to provide for the education of their mixed- race children. For example, shortly before the start of the American Civil War, nearly all the 200 young men at Wilberforce College in southern Ohio, established by white and black Ohio Methodist leaders for the education of blacks, were mixed-race sons of wealthy white Southern planters.Horace Talbert, The Sons of Allen: Together with a Sketch of the Rise and Progress of Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio, 1906, p. 273, Documenting the South, 2000, University of North Carolina, accessed July 25, 2008 At the time, Georgia law (and that of most other states) prohibited interracial marriage, as well as education of all blacks, free or slave. The state legislature required a separate act for each manumission that a slaveholder wanted, even for one's family members. These difficulties essentially ended white fathers in the South freeing their slave children and concubines. But the Healy couple lived together as man and wife from 1829 until their deaths a few months apart in 1850, and had intended to move to the North with their youngest children. During that time they had ten children, nine of whom survived to adulthood. Education Some accounts suggest that Mary Eliza was freed but it was unlikely. The laws in Georgia prohibited the education of blacks, whether slave or free. Such anti-literacy laws had been instituted in southern states following Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831. To overcome obstacles for their children, Healy explored schools in the North in 1837. Two of his sisters and their families had settled in New York City, but boarding schools there would not accept the mixed-race James, the oldest son.Foley (1954), Bishop Healy, p. 11 Born in 1830, James was enrolled in a Quaker school in Flushing, New York in 1837. After completing elementary school, he attended a Quaker preparatory school in Burlington, New Jersey. Some of James' younger brothers followed him in this path. At the Quaker schools, the boys faced criticism because their father was a slaveholder, which was in conflict with Quaker principles of equality of men. They also faced discrimination as Irish Catholics at a time of greatly increased immigration to the United States during the Great Famine. Around 1844, the senior Michael Healy met John Bernard Fitzpatrick, the Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Boston. He learned of the new College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, which was accepting children of grammar school age in its boarding preparatory school. In 1844, Healy sent his sons James 14, Hugh 12, Patrick 10, and Sherwood 8, to be enrolled at Holy Cross, and they all graduated from the college. The fifth son Michael, then only 6 years old, followed a few years later, enrolling in 1849 at Holy Cross. The Healy parents intended to sell their plantation and move to the North with their three youngest children. When the parents each died unexpectedly in 1850, their son Hugh Healy risked his freedom to return to Georgia from New York to take his three youngest siblings to the North. Still legally a slave in Georgia, he could have been captured by slave catchers and sold in the slave trade. After graduating from Holy Cross, Hugh Healy had moved to New York City, where he was building a hardware business. Executors of his parents' estate liquidated the plantation and other assets, while Hugh returned to New York with his younger siblings. There he arranged for them to be baptized as Catholics in the Church of St. Francis Xavier on June 13, 1851.\\"Eliza Healy (Sister Mary Magdalen)\\", Blackpast.org Hugh Healy died at age 21 as a result of an infection contracted after a boating accident in the Hudson River. =The Healy children= James Augustine Healy Patrick Francis Healy =James Augustine Healy= James Augustine Healy (1830‚Äì1900) graduated valedictorian of the Holy Cross's first graduating class in 1849. In 1962, Holy Cross christened its newest dormitory as Healy Hall in his honor, for his achievements in developing the Catholic diocese in Maine. He was consecrated as Bishop of Portland, Maine on June 2, 1875. At a period of rapid growth in Catholic immigration, Healy oversaw the establishment of 60 new churches, 68 missions, 18 convents and 18 schools in the diocese. Since the late 20th century, he has been considered the first American with African- American ancestry to serve as a Roman Catholic Bishop in the United States.\\"James Augustine Healy\\", African American Registry Albert S.

He was the first American with African ancestry to earn a PhD, completing it at Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris. He was named a dean at Georgetown University in 1866. At the age of 39, on July 31, 1874, he assumed the presidency of what was then the largest Catholic college in the United States, now the first known African American to do so.\\"Patrick Francis Healy\\", American Memory, Library of Congress, accessed February 7, 2011 Patrick Healy's influence on Georgetown University was so far-reaching that he is often referred to as the school's \\"second founder,\\" following Archbishop John Carroll. Healy helped develop the small nineteenth- century college as a major university for the twentieth century. He modernized the curriculum by requiring courses in the sciences, particularly chemistry and physics. He expanded and upgraded the schools of law and medicine. In the antebellum years, the college had drawn most of its students from the South; four-fifths of the alumni fought as Confederates. In the later nineteenth century, it began to draw more students from the Northeast, which had a higher rate of Catholic immigration. During Healy's tenure, the college adopted the colors of blue and grey as a symbol of reconciliation for the nation. Healy Hall, which currently houses Georgetown University's undergraduate admissions office, is named after him. =Alexander Sherwood Healy= Alexander Sherwood Healy (called Sherwood) (1836‚Äì1875) was also ordained as a priest, in Paris in 1858.

All three of the Healy girls, Martha, Josephine, and Eliza, were educated from childhood at the convent school of the Congregation of Notre Dame in Montreal. They became nuns, following the women and the institution that had been influential in their lives. *Martha Healy (1840‚Äì1920) joined the Congregation of Notre Dame in Montreal in 1855. In 1863 she left the order and moved to Boston, joining two brothers and her sisters in that region. On July 25, 1865, in Waltham, Massachusetts, she married Jeremiah Cashman, an Irish immigrant. They had a child. *Josephine Amanda Healy (1849‚Äì1883), also went to the convent school.

Much evidence exists that, with the social capital of their education and father's wealth, the Healy children were accepted into northern U.S. and Canadian society as \\"white\\" Irish Americans. Martha and Michael, who both married and had children, each chose Irish Catholic spouses. In 1865, Michael A. Healy married Mary Jane Roach, the daughter of Irish Catholic immigrants. They had one surviving child, a son named Frederick Aloysius (1870‚Äì1912). According to James M.

The charter enlists the name of services, the conditions for obtaining that service and the time limit within which the services are made available to the citizen. Process of Preparation Immediately after the constitution of the local government, following a general election, the local government shall, as soon as possible but not later than a period of six months therefrom, meet, discuss and decide as to whatever services the local government can make available to the Citizens, the conditions a Citizen shall have to fulfill for getting such a service and the time limit to make available the service. Before taking a decision to publish the Citizens charter, the local government should seek the views of the Secretary of the local body, other Officers concerned and consider the factors like availability of Officials, sufficiency of fund, etc. to provide time bound services as offered in the citizens charter. The local governments should, simultaneously, determine, the procedure of providing service, the quality and the fee leviable for the service if it is a paid one. It should be examined whether the service so offered to be rendered time bound shall be one that come within the ambit of the jurisdiction of the local government. The services offered by various institutions under the control of the local government should also be included in the citizens charter. The Charter should be prepared and published in the prescribed. The application form for obtaining the services should be made available to the people cost- free or by collecting the actual cost. Publication of the Charter The Citizens Charter prepared by the local governments in Kerala shall be published by affixing it on the notice board at the Office of the local government and on other notice boards fixed at public places in the local government area. As well, the citizens charter shall be printed in booklet form and distributed free of cost among the public. The local government shall give necessary publicity to the Citizens Charter and shall take steps to make available copies of the Citizens Charter to those who demand. The gist of the Citizens Charter published by the Panchayat shall be written in paint on a board and exhibited in the local government office so as to enable the public to view it easily. The Citizens Charter, thus published, shall also be read out in the next meetings of the Grama Sabha for wider publicity. Duration of the Charter A Citizens Charter prepared and published by a local government shall remain in force till the expiry of the term of the said local government council and thereafter till a Citizens Charter is prepared and published by the newly constituted council of elected functionaries. Procedure for Obtaining Services A person, in need of service enlisted in the Charter, shall apply in the form prescribed, to the local government Secretary or to the Officer concerned. The local government should have an enquiry counter for distributing the application forms, for receiving application and for giving reply to the enquiries in the respective office. A serial number shall be assigned to every application for service, received by the Secretary or the Officer concerned and the details such as the name of the applicant, the date of receipt of the application, the request in the application, etc. shall be recorded in a register. Immediately on receipt of an application, an acknowledgement receipt shall be issued to the applicant recording therein the probable date on which the service may be rendered, the name of the Officer whom the applicant may approach in this regard and other necessary details. Obligation to Render Services The local government, the secretary and the officers concerned in the local government have obligation to render a service referred in the Citizen's Charter to an eligible applicant within the respective time limit. The failure in providing the service will be treated as delinquency. If a service cannot be rendered within the stipulated time limit, the concerned Officer shall intimate the reason to the applicant within the said time limit. Simultaneously, if possible, the revised time limit shall also be intimated to the applicant. If an applicant feels that an Officer of the local body fails to render a service or cause delay, he may bring the complaint to the notice of the chairperson of the local government, which he shall personally examine and dispose of. If a Chairperson or a Member of the local government or an Officer of the local government has deliberately committed default or delay in making available a service enlisted in the charter to a citizen, he may file a complaint before the Ombudsman for Local Governments in Kerala, alleging that the local government or the member of the local government or the Officer of the local government is guilty of committing ‚Äòmaladministration‚Äô which is punishable by the Ombudsman. Revision and Evaluation The local government shall, once in every year, revise and update the Citizens Charter prepared and published after discussion. The purpose of revision of the Citizens Charter every year is for bringing in suitable changes based on the experience during the previous year and for including more services in it and for reducing the time limit in rendering the services. The revised citizens charter shall also be published in the notice boards of the local government and the copies shall be printed and distributed among the people. The local government shall often evaluate the progress in rendering services mentioned in the Citizens Charter and shall issue necessary guidelines to the Officers concerned. A best practice Cheruvannur-Nallalam Grama Panchayat has set a good example in implementing the Citizen‚Äôs charter in the right spirit. The panchayat has put up a wall- sized Citizen's charter outside its office. The charter enlists 55 services, categorized under different heads, offered to its citizens numbering around 60,000 in total. The applications for the services are accepted in a counter. A receipt, denoting the possible date on which the service can be made available, will be issued on the spot. The panchayat has as well, put up another large board at its entrance that provides the details of the section from where a particular service is offered and the officer in charge of the section and his presence so as to enable the citizens to obtain the services without hassles. Simultaneously, the panchayat had experimented a front office counter where the applicant can submit the application and obtain the services, without going to the concerned section. Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) has included the front office counter system as a best practice in its training programmes. The panchayat has organized a well-kept record room which would help the panchayat in providing information under the right to information act. The report on good Governance at the grassroots level prepared by the Centre for Good Governance cites Nallalam-Cheruvannur as a good example from Kerala.Panchayat Raj Update XV (9) September 2008 P 8 The benefits or Outcome The Charter makes it very clear that the services are their right and not a favour from the local government functionaries. The increasing demand for time bound services by the public may lead to qualitative improvement in services. The Charter will help the local body to evaluate the delivery of services annually and make necessary improvements in service delivery. The creation of The Charter will bring professionalism in to local government services and will help the services reach the less privileged class of people increasingly. The State of Kerala is showing a way to improve the service delivery in local government through creation of citizens charter.

Its lyrical themes are often based on the work of famous Greek poets. √ântekhno arose in the late 1950s, drawing on rebetiko's westernization by Vassilis Tsitsanis and Manolis Chiotis. Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hatzidakis were the most popular early composers of √©ntekhno song cycles. Origins As opposed to other forms of Greek urban folk music, √©ntekhno concerts would often take place outside a hall or a night club in the open air. Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis were the most popular early composers of √©ntekhno song cycles. They were both educated in Classical music and -among other reasons- the lacking of a wide public for this kind of music in Greece, drove them to the invention of √ântekhno, in which they transferred some values of Western art music.\\"When Progress Fails, Try Greekness: From Manolis Kalomiris to Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis\\": Paris Konstantinidis, When Progress Fails, Try Greekness: From Manolis Kalomiris to Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis, in Nikos Maliaras (ed.), \\"The National Element in Music\\" (Conference proceedings, Athens, 18‚Äì20 January 2013), University of Athens, Athens 2014. pp. 314‚Äì320.

History The PPTT was formed on 25 July 1948 as the transformation into political party of the Association Autonomistic Regional Studies (Associazione Studi Autonomistici Regionali, ASAR). ASAR, whose slogan was \\"integral autonomy from Borghetto to Brenner\\", was a group which fought successfully for the establishment of the Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol as special statute Region. In the 1948 provincial election the party won 16.8% of the vote and became a junior partner in Christian Democracy-led government. The PPTT, whose longstanding leader was Enrico Pruner, became the sister-party of the South Tyrolean People's Party, although the two were independent parties. In 1982 a split between the conservative wing, led by Franco Tretter, and the centrist wing of the party, led by longstanding leader Enrico Pruner. The first group retained the name of the party but later changed it to Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Union, while second one took the name of Integral Autonomy.

It is his third published novel after Cries in the Drizzle and To Live. It is the story of a silk factory worker, Xu Sanguan, who sells his blood over the years, in most cases in an attempt to improve the lives of himself and his family members, and overcome family difficulties. The story is set in the late 1940s until the 1980s, from the early years of the People's Republic of China until after the Cultural Revolution. The story begins with Xu Sanguan‚Äôs visit to his grandpa, when he first knew about selling blood. His first time to sell blood is to prove his body is in good health. After discovering that selling blood can quickly get him a lot of cash, he begins to sell blood constantly when he and his family struggle with life difficulties. By the end of the story, Xu Sanguan‚Äôs family no longer lacks cash, and he thus no longer needs to sell blood to support his family. The space of ‚Äúfolk‚Äù in the novel is neatly built by the extensive use of repetitions and dialogues, which highlights the nature of Chinese peasants and the social scenario of the era. The novel holds elements of black humor‚Äîa characteristic that Yu Hua typically applies in his other novels such as To Live.Wang, Ya-juan and Li Zong-wei ‚ÄúStudy of Black Humor in Chronicle of A Blood Merchant (Áî®ÈªëËâ≤ ÂπΩÈªòËß£ËØª„Ää ËÆ∏‰∏âËßÇÂçñË°ÄËÆ∞„Äã)‚Äù Journal of Hetao University, no.1 (2014): 34-37.

The book received rave reviews from critics and an English translation by Andrew F. Jones was released in 2003. The title has also been translated as The Chronicle of Xu Sanguan‚Äôs Blood Selling, Xu Sanguan‚Äôs Records of Selling Blood and The Tale of Xu Sanguan Selling Blood. The translator stated that this novel is \\"a work of literary imagination and social critique.\\" Plot Xu Sanguan works in a silk factory, distributing silk-worm cocoons to the spinners. To make extra income, Xu Sanguan decides to sell blood at a hospital. He befriends Genlong and Ah Fang, who are blood-sellers themselves and with whom Xu travels to the hospital. The two tell Xu that every time after they sold their blood, they have a plate of fried pork livers and two shots of yellow rice wine at the Victory Restaurant, believing that the pork livers replenish blood while the rice wine maintains the blood quality. Xu Sanguan marries Xu Yulan and gives birth to three boys soon after: Yile, Erle and Sanle. After nine years, questions about Yile‚Äôs legitimacy arises, and it is revealed that Xu Yulan had slept with her ex-lover, He Xiaoyong. Xu Sanguan‚Äôs relationship with Yile becomes tumultuous as a result. One day, the sons get into a fight and Yile critically injures Blacksmith Fang‚Äôs son. At first, both Xu and He deny responsibility for Yile‚Äôs actions and refuse to pay for Blacksmith Fang‚Äôs son‚Äôs hospital bill. But Xu sells his blood and pays his debt to Fang. Ashamed of being a cuckold, Xu sleeps with a former love interest of his, Lin Fenfang. 1958 rolls around, and the family is caught in the socio-political upheaval brought about by the Great Leap Forward. Famine sweeps across the country. With communal canteens set up by the Chinese Communist Party all closing, Xu‚Äôs family is forced to look out for themselves. The silk factory where Xu Sanguan works also closes. After selling his blood once again, Xu Sanguan takes the whole family except Yile to eat noodles at the Victory Restaurant. Distraught, Yile approaches He Xiaoyong, his supposed biological father, hoping to find acceptance, but is also rejected. After wandering the streets, Yile returns to a worried Xu Sanguan who takes him to the Victory Restaurant for noodles. Xu Sanguan‚Äôs relationship with Yile is mended as a result. One day, He Xiaoyong gets hit by a truck and is critically injured. After consulting a fortune-teller, He Xiaoyong‚Äôs wife is told that to recover her husband‚Äôs soul from heaven, a son must call atop the chimney and beg for his soul to return. However, as He Xiaoyong only has two daughters, He‚Äôs wife approaches Yile, He Xiaoyong‚Äôs supposed biological son, for help. After some convincing, Yile agrees, and proceeds to call atop the chimney for He Xiaoyong‚Äôs soul to return. Xu Sanguan retrieves Yile from the chimney and swears an oath claiming Yile as his son. It is later revealed that He Xiaoyong did not survive his injuries. The Cultural Revolution arrives. Xu Yulan is accused of being a prostitute and is forced to suffer through struggle sessions. Day after day, Xu Yulan stands in the street on a stool with a placard labelled ‚ÄòXu Yulan, Prostitute‚Äô. Yile is sent to the countryside as part of the Communist Party‚Äôs policy of re-education. Erle is also sent away after graduating school, leaving only Sanle with Xu Sanguan and Xu Yulan. Sanle begins working in a machine tools factory after completing school. Xu Sanguan finds himself running low on money again and goes to sell blood. At the blood station, he coincidentally finds Genlong, whom he had not seen for ten years. Xu learns that Ah Fang is in poor health after his bladder had burst from drinking too much water. The two men head to Victory Restaurant for a meal afterwards, but Genlong falls ill and dies. The doctors say Genlong died from a cerebral hemorrhage, but Xu suspects Genlong sold too much blood. Back at the countryside where Yile and Erle‚Äôs production brigades work, Yile becomes sick. Erle carries his brother to the ferry and they both return to town where Yile can receive treatment. It is revealed that Yile contracted hepatitis and must travel to Shanghai for proper treatment. Erle also falls ill from a flu and is sent to hospital. Xu Sanguan goes around the village borrowing money and gathers enough to send Yile and Xu Yulan to Shanghai. He plans to meet them in Shanghai and resorts to selling blood once again. Xu Sanguan sets off for Shanghai, selling blood at multiple hospitals along his journey. He grows increasingly weak from the practice and is hospitalized for a period of time. Xu Sanguan manages to hitch a ride on a barge, and he befriends the two brothers operating the vessel, Laixi and Laishun. Xu travels with them for several days and the three sell blood along the way. Eventually, Xu parts ways with the brothers and reaches Shanghai, where he finds Yile is alive and recovering well. Some years later, Yile, Erle and Sanle have all gotten stable jobs, gotten married, had children and moved into their own houses. One day, Xu Sanguan passes Victory Restaurant and feels the urge to sell blood. But this time, he is rejected as he is deemed too old. Xu becomes worried that he can no longer sell blood to support his family when in need. But Xu Yulan, Yile, Erle, and Sanle remind him that he doesn‚Äôt need to sell blood anymore for the tough times have passed. The novel ends with the family having a meal of fried pork livers and yellow rice wine at the Victory Restaurant.Yu, Hua. Chronicle of a Blood Merchant: A Novel. Translated by Andrew F. Jones, Anchor Books, 2004. Major themes Chronicle of a Blood Merchant describes the suffering of the lower class which took place during the most turbulent time in Chinese history, and creates a sorrowful atmosphere with a touch of gentleness. Blood is the main element, which builds up throughout the majority of the story. The protagonist sells his blood twelve times in the story for many reasons, including cultural taboo, food, and sacrifices. Xu Sanguan sells his blood to overcome crises he faces in his life, to a point where he believes that selling blood could overcome any crisis.

Critical response According to Jeffrey Wasserstrom, Chronicle of a Blood Merchant was \\"hailed by many as one of the best books published in China in the 1990s.\\" Richard King addressed Gang Yue's comparison to Lu Xun by stating that \\"Yu Hua‚Äôs small-town everyman becomes a figure of a dignity to which Ah Q could never aspire\\". King also praised the novel's construction. The book was praised in The Seattle Times.as a \\"rare achievement in literature‚Ä¶. [Xu Sanguan is] a character that reflects not just a generation but the soul of a people.\\" Michael Laris of The Washington Post argued, ‚ÄúThe epic -- and at times crude -- stories of struggle and survival in [...] Chronicle of a Blood Merchant offer unforgettable images of cruelty and kindness, Yu Hua's characters are torn between their animal instincts and their humanity. What Yu Hua brings to these narratives is a steely willingness to take things too far.‚ÄùReviewed by Michael Laris. 2003. \\"Bestial Acts; Brutal Portraits of Life in Modern China: FINAL Edition.\\" The Washington Post. Ha Jin, author of Waiting, described Yu Hua as a \\"major contemporary novelist\\" and stated that the latter \\"writes with a cold eye but a warm heart. His novels are ingeniously structured and exude a mythical aura. Though unmistakably Chinese, they are universally resonant.‚Äù Dai Sijie, author of Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress (2000), called it a \\"wrenching and blackly humorous tale. Long after I closed the book, the character Xu Sanguan has remained stubbornly impressed upon my heart.‚Äù Wang Ping, author of Foreign Devil (1996) and Aching for Beauty (2000), wrote, ‚ÄúChronicle of a Blood Merchant takes us straight to the heartland of China‚Äîthe towns, streets, courtyards, kitchens, and bedrooms where ordinary Chinese live. They may not be great warriors or politicians, but their courageous efforts in living a life with hope and dignity make them true heroes. This book is a gem.‚Äù Nola Theiss, author of Kliatt, argued, ‚ÄúThe story is filled with strange attitudes and behaviors, which give insight to this peculiar time and place. Yu Hua is considered one of the most important young writers in China today and his writing carries a truth that is typical of fables and parables.‚ÄùTheiss, Nola. \\"Hua, Yu.
