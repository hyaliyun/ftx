He was principal conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra from 1949 to 1969. According to music critic Ted Libbey, Mitchell \\"personified the optimism that permeated Washington and America after World War II; he socialized, schmoozed and charmed the ladies of high Washington society, fitting right in, playing the role of music director as he played the cello. He saw the symphony as a necessary component of the city's social and cultural life, an institution to be supported by the enlightened few and used to educate and enrich the many.\\" Born in Nebraska, Mitchell attended the Peabody Conservatory and graduated with honors from the Curtis Institute of Music in 1935. Mitchell joined the National Symphony Orchestra as principal cellist in 1933. In addition to playing with the NSO, Mitchell made his conducting debut with the ensemble in 1941, and was named associate conductor in 1946. He was one of two candidates being considered to replace Hans Kindler, and in 1949 Mitchell began the longest tenure of any NSO music director to date, and one especially marked by his campaign to bring great visiting conductors to Washington. Praised for his enthusiasm, deeply involved in the community, a skilled fund-raiser and respected by musicians as one who had risen from the ranks, Mitchell embodied the optimism and ‚Äúcan-do‚Äù spirit of the time. Few conductors anywhere have equaled Mitchell‚Äôs extraordinary commitment to community outreach and education. Under his leadership, the NSO presented ‚ÄúYoung People‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚ÄúTiny Tots‚Äù concerts, and a ground-breaking series called ‚ÄúMusic for Young America‚Äù. The last initiative offered programs free to school groups visiting the Washington area. Mitchell also expanded the orchestra‚Äôs touring exponentially, including its first to Europe and an astounding three months of touring Latin America. A hallmark was the inclusion of at least one American work on every concert program. Making use of the burgeoning recording industry, he devised two educational recording anthologies with the NSO. The anthologies were accompanied by study guides, allowing teachers who were not themselves musicians to incorporate music in classroom settings. On the Westminster label Mitchell made recordings with his orchestra of music by Brahms (Violin Concerto with violinist Julian Olefsky), Copland (Appalachian Spring; Billy the Kid; Fanfare for the Common Man; El Sal√≥n M√©xico), Creston (Symphonies Nos. 2 & 3) and Shostakovich (Symphony No. 1; The Golden Age ballet suite).

It is a sequel to the stories in the collection High Justice. As with those stories, it weaves the story of pioneering individuals in space with considerations of the technical and financial challenges facing them. It was republished in an omnibus edition with High Justice in 2009 as Exile‚Äîand Glory. Despite being written and published after the landmark novel The Mote in God's Eye, which Pournelle co-authored with Larry Niven, the tone, style and themes of this novel are akin to a juvenile novel of the sort written by Robert A. Heinlein in the 1950s. Pournelle returns to his favorite themes of breakdown of the rule of law, the politics of entitlement and disdain for anti-technology activists. This novel and the collection High Justice are thought by some to be part of the CoDominium series. However, there is no direct evidence for this in any of the stories, although there is nothing contradictory either. This novel's dedication page reads \\"For Dan Alderson, the sane genius\\". Alderson, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, conceived the Alderson drive and Langston field technologies used in the CoDominium stories. It is also related to the novel Birth of Fire and together with High Justice, they be seen as a starting point for the CoDominium series. Plot summary An intelligent young misfit, Kevin Senecal, leaves Earth to escape various troubles, including a teen gang vendetta which the authorities will not act to stop, and bureaucratic interference in his studies for an engineering degree, in a culture where environmentalists and zero-growth advocates hold sway. He enlists with the Hansen Corporation, a huge conglomerate which has re-located to the Moon, and is now involved in asteroid mining. He is to go to the asteroid Ceres. The journey involves laser launch from Earth to orbit, and a long voyage on a ship using the NERVA nuclear rocket technology. During the journey, all the passengers have to be involved in maintaining the shipboard environment, which includes algae to generate oxygen from photosynthesis. Kevin falls in love with a mystery woman called Ellen MacMillan. Between them they deal with the consequences of sabotage of the ship by persons unknown, and find a way to effect the rendezvous at Ceres after the ship's computer is sabotaged. They use the expertise of Jacob Norsedal, a prototypical computer hacker who is also a top-notch mathematician and physicist. At Ceres Ellen reveals herself to be an agent for Hansen investigating the mining work, which is plagued with irregularities. In particular, a new element called Arthurium is being mined on Ceres. This is a stable transuranic element of the kind predicted during the 1970s based on the theory of an Island of stability for elements of atomic number 114, 120 and 126. Being super-heavy, these elements sink into the cores of planets and are not accessible, but may be found in asteroids. In the story, the arthurium is a possible catalyst for hydrogen fusion and is vital to both the economy of Earth and the future of spaceflight. Rival corporations and mineral interests on Earth want to steal the arthurium or stop its production. Anti-technology politicians would like to shut down all space industry and dedicate the money to the Welfare State. Ellen is actually Glenda Hansen-Mackenzie, daughter of Aeneas Mackenzie and Laurie Jo Hansen, owner of the Hansen Corporation. She can foil the plots if she can access the Ceres computer system. However, she, Kevin and Jacob are marooned on one of Ceres' small satellites by the enemy agents. They improvise a steam-jet rocket which lets them land back on Ceres and bring an end to the intrigue. Uses of the name Glenda The name \\"Glenda\\" appears in three places in the CoDominium series. Apart from this character (in both this novel and High Justice), it appears in The Prince as the name of the rebel military leader (and consort of Colonel John Christian Falkenberg III) on New Washington. It is also the given name of the daughter of Rod and Sally Blaine in The Gripping Hand.

Most criticism of Wikipedia has been directed towards its content, its community of established users, and its processes. The principal criticism it receives concerns the online encyclopedia's factual reliability, the readability and organization of the articles, the lack of methodical fact-checking, and its exposure to political and biased editing. Systemic, gender, racial, and national biases have all been criticized, while corporate campaigns and other conflicts of interest have been highlighted. Further concerns include the vandalism and partisanship facilitated by anonymous editing, clique behavior, social stratification between a guardian class and newer users, excessive rule-making, edit warring, and uneven application of policies. Criticism of content The reliability of Wikipedia is often questioned. In \\"Wikipedia: The Dumbing Down of World Knowledge\\" (2010), journalist Edwin Black characterized the content of articles as a mixture of \\"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\\". Oliver Kamm, in \\"Wisdom?: More like Dumbness of the Crowds\\" (2007), said that articles usually are dominated by the loudest and most persistent editorial voices or by an interest group with an ideological \\"axe to grind\\". In his article \\"The 'Undue Weight' of Truth on Wikipedia\\" (2012), Timothy Messer‚ÄìKruse criticized the undue-weight policy that deals with the relative importance of sources, observing that it showed Wikipedia's goal was not to present correct and definitive information about a subject but to present the majority opinion of the sources cited. In their article \\"You Just Type in What You are Looking for: Undergraduates' Use of Library Resources vs. Wikipedia\\" (2012) in an academic librarianship journal, the authors noted another author's point that omissions within an article might give the reader false ideas about a topic, based upon the incomplete content of Wikipedia. cited Fallis, Don. ‚ÄúToward an Epistemology‚Äù (2008) Wikipedia is sometimes characterized as having a hostile editing environment. In Common Knowledge?: An Ethnography of Wikipedia (2014), Dariusz Jemielniak, a steward for Wikimedia Foundation projects, stated that the complexity of the rules and laws governing editorial content and the behavior of the editors is a burden for new editors and a licence for the \\"office politics\\" of disruptive editors. In a follow-up article, Jemielniak said that abridging and rewriting the editorial rules and laws of Wikipedia for clarity of purpose and simplicity of application would resolve the bureaucratic bottleneck of too many rules. In The Rise and Decline of an Open Collaboration System: How Wikipedia's Reaction to Popularity is Causing its Decline (2013), Aaron Halfaker said the over- complicated rules and laws of Wikipedia unintentionally provoked the decline in editorial participation that began in 2009‚Äîfrightening away new editors who otherwise would contribute to Wikipedia. There have also been works that describe the possible misuse of Wikipedia. In \\"Wikipedia or Wickedpedia?\\" (2008), the Hoover Institution said Wikipedia is an unreliable resource for correct knowledge, information, and facts about a subject, because, as an open source website, the editorial content of the articles is readily subjected to manipulation and propaganda. The 2014 edition of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's official student handbook, Academic Integrity at MIT, informs students that Wikipedia is not a reliable academic source, stating, \\"the bibliography published at the end of the Wikipedia entry may point you to potential sources. However, do not assume that these sources are reliable use the same criteria to judge them as you would any other source. Do not consider the Wikipedia bibliography as a replacement for your own research.\\" =Accuracy of information= Not authoritative Wikipedia acknowledges that the encyclopedia should not be used as a primary source for research, either academic or informational. The British librarian Philip Bradley said, \\"the main problem is the lack of authority. With printed publications, the publishers have to ensure that their data are reliable, as their livelihood depends on it. But with something like this, all that goes out the window.\\" Likewise, Robert McHenry, editor-in-chief of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from 1992 to 1997, said that readers of Wikipedia articles cannot know who wrote the article they are reading‚Äîit might have been written by an expert in the subject matter or by an amateur. In November 2015, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger told Zach Schwartz in Vice: \\"I think Wikipedia never solved the problem of how to organize itself in a way that didn't lead to mob rule\\" and that since he left the project, \\"People that I would say are trolls sort of took over. The inmates started running the asylum.\\" Comparative study of science articles \\"Teaching criticism vs. teaching praise\\": an analysis of talk-page messages for the In \\"Internet Encyclopaedias Go Head-to-head\\", a 2005 article published in the scientific journal Nature, the results of a blind experiment (single-blind study), which compared the factual and informational accuracy of entries from Wikipedia and the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, were reported. The 42-entry sample included science articles and biographies of scientists, which were compared for accuracy by anonymous academic reviewers; they found that the average Wikipedia entry contained four errors and omissions, while the average Encyclop√¶dia Britannica entry contained three errors and omissions. The study concluded that Wikipedia and Britannica were comparable in terms of the accuracy of its science entries. Nevertheless, the reviewers had two principal criticisms of the Wikipedia science entries: (i) thematically confused content, without an intelligible structure (order, presentation, interpretation); and (ii) that undue weight is given to controversial, fringe theories about the subject matter. The dissatisfaction of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica editors led to Nature publishing additional survey documentation that substantiated the results of the comparative study. Based upon the additional documents, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica denied the validity of the study, stating it was flawed, because the Britannica extracts were compilations that sometimes included articles written for the youth version of the encyclopedia. In turn, Nature acknowledged that some Britannica articles were compilations, but denied that such editorial details invalidated the conclusions of the comparative study of the science articles. The editors of Britannica also said that while the Nature study showed that the rate of error between the two encyclopedias was similar, the errors in a Wikipedia article usually were errors of fact, while the errors in a Britannica article were errors of omission. According to the editors of Britannica, Britannica was more accurate than Wikipedia in that respect. Subsequently, Nature magazine rejected the Britannica response with a rebuttal of the editors' specific objections about the research method of the study. Lack of methodical fact-checking American journalist John Seigenthaler, the object of the Seigenthaler incident Inaccurate information that is not obviously false may persist in Wikipedia for a long time before it is challenged. The most prominent cases reported by mainstream media involved biographies of living people. The Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident demonstrated that the subject of a biographical article must sometimes fix blatant lies about his own life. In May 2005, an anonymous user edited the biographical article on American journalist and writer John Seigenthaler so that it contained several false and defamatory statements. The inaccurate claims went unnoticed from May until September 2005 when they were discovered by Victor S. Johnson Jr., a friend of Seigenthaler. Wikipedia content is often mirrored at sites such as Answers.com, which means that incorrect information can be replicated alongside correct information through a number of web sources. Such information can thereby develop false authority due to its presence at such sites. In another example, on March 2, 2007, MSNBC.com reported that then-New York Senator Hillary Clinton had been incorrectly listed for 20 months in her Wikipedia biography as having been valedictorian of her class of 1969 at Wellesley College, when in fact she was not (though she did speak at commencement). The article included a link to the Wikipedia edit, where the incorrect information was added on July 9, 2005. The inaccurate information was removed within 24 hours after the MSNBC.com report appeared. Attempts to perpetrate hoaxes may not be confined to editing existing Wikipedia articles, but can also include creating new articles. In October 2005, Alan Mcilwraith, a call center worker from Scotland, created a Wikipedia article in which he wrote that he was a highly decorated war hero. The article was quickly identified as a hoax by other users and deleted. There have also been instances of users deliberately inserting false information into Wikipedia in order to test the system and demonstrate its alleged unreliability. Gene Weingarten, a journalist, ran such a test in 2007, in which he inserted false information into his own Wikipedia article; it was removed 27 hours later by a Wikipedia editor. Wikipedia considers the deliberate insertion of false and misleading information to be vandalism. Neutral point of view and conflicts of interest Wikipedia regards the concept of a neutral point of view as one of its non-negotiable principles; however, it acknowledges that such a concept has its limitations its NPOV policy states that articles should be \\"as far as possible\\" written \\"without editorial bias\\". Mark Glaser, a journalist, also wrote that this may be an impossible ideal due to the inevitable biases of editors. Research has shown that articles can maintain bias in spite of the neutral point of view policy through word choice, the presentation of opinions and controversial claims as facts, and framing bias.. In August 2007, a tool called WikiScanner‚Äîdeveloped by Virgil Griffith, a visiting researcher from the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico‚Äîwas released to match edits to the encyclopedia by non-registered users with an extensive database of IP addresses. News stories appeared about IP addresses from various organizations such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Diebold, Inc. and the Australian government being used to make edits to Wikipedia articles, sometimes of an opinionated or questionable nature. Another story stated that an IP address from the BBC itself had been used to vandalize the article on George W. Bush. The BBC quoted a Wikipedia spokesperson as praising the tool: \\"We really value transparency and the scanner really takes this to another level. Wikipedia Scanner may prevent an organisation or individuals from editing articles that they're really not supposed to.\\" Not everyone hailed WikiScanner as a success for Wikipedia. Oliver Kamm, in a column for The Times, argued instead that: (Author's own copy ) > The WikiScanner is thus an important development in bringing down a > pernicious influence on our intellectual life. Critics of the web decry the > medium as the cult of the amateur. Wikipedia is worse than that; it is the > province of the covert lobby. The most constructive course is to stand on > the sidelines and jeer at its pretensions. WikiScanner reveals conflicts of interest only when the editor does not have a Wikipedia account and their IP address is used instead. Conflict-of-interest editing done by editors with accounts is not detected, since those edits are anonymous to everyone except some Wikipedia administrators. Scientific disputes The 2005 Nature study also gave two brief examples of challenges that Wikipedian science writers purportedly faced on Wikipedia. The first concerned the addition of a section on violence to the schizophrenia article, which was little more than a \\"rant\\" about the need to lock people up, in the view of one of the article's regular editors, neuropsychologist Vaughan Bell. He said that editing it stimulated him to look up the literature on the topic. Another dispute involved the climate researcher William Connolley, a Wikipedia editor who was opposed by others. The topic in this second dispute was the , and The New Yorker reported that this dispute, which was far more protracted, had led to arbitration, which took three months to produce a decision. The outcome of arbitration, as reported by Nature, was a six-month parole for Connolley, during which he was restricted to undoing edits on articles once per day. Exposure to political operatives and advocates While Wikipedia policy requires articles to have a neutral point of view, it is not immune from attempts by outsiders (or insiders) with an agenda to place a spin on articles. In January 2006 it was revealed that several staffers of members of the U.S. House of Representatives had embarked on a campaign to cleanse their respective bosses' biographies on Wikipedia, as well as inserting negative remarks on political opponents. References to a campaign promise by Martin Meehan to surrender his seat in 2000 were deleted, and negative comments were inserted into the articles on United States Senator Bill Frist and Eric Cantor, a congressman from Virginia. Numerous other changes were made from an IP address assigned to the House of Representatives. In an interview, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales remarked that the changes were \\"not cool\\". Larry Delay and Pablo Bachelet wrote that from their perspective, some articles dealing with Latin American history and groups (such as the Sandinistas and Cuba) lack political neutrality and are written from a sympathetic Marxist perspective which treats socialist dictatorships favorably at the expense of alternative positions. Alt URL In 2008, the pro-Israel group Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) organized an e-mail campaign to encourage readers to correct perceived Israel- related biases and inconsistencies in Wikipedia. CAMERA argued the excerpts were unrepresentative and that it had explicitly campaigned merely \\"toward encouraging people to learn about and edit the online encyclopedia for accuracy\\". Defenders of CAMERA and the competing group, Electronic Intifada, went into mediation. Israeli diplomat David Saranga said Wikipedia is generally fair in regard to Israel. When it was pointed out that the entry on Israel mentioned the word \\"occupation\\" nine times, whereas the entry on the Palestinian People mentioned \\"terror\\" only once, he responded, \\"It means only one thing: Israelis should be more active on Wikipedia. Instead of blaming it, they should go on the site much more, and try and change it.\\" Political commentator Haviv Rettig Gur, reviewing widespread perceptions in Israel of systemic bias in Wikipedia articles, has argued that there are deeper structural problems creating this bias: anonymous editing favors biased results, especially if the editors organize concerted campaigns of defamation as has been done in articles dealing with Arab-Israeli issues, and current Wikipedia policies, while well-meant, have proven ineffective in handling this. On August 31, 2008, The New York Times ran an article detailing the edits made to the biography of Alaska governor Sarah Palin in the wake of her nomination as the running mate of Arizona Senator John McCain. During the 24 hours before the McCain campaign announcement, 30 edits, many of them adding flattering details, were made to the article by the user \\"Young_Trigg\\". This person later acknowledged working on the McCain campaign, and having several other user accounts. In November 2007, libelous accusations were made against two politicians from southwestern France, Jean-Pierre Grand and H√©l√®ne Mandroux-Colas, on their Wikipedia biographies. Grand asked the president of the French National Assembly and Prime Minister to reinforce the legislation on the penal responsibility of Internet sites and of authors who peddle false information in order to cause harm. Senator Jean Louis Masson then requested the Minister of Justice to tell him whether it would be possible to increase the criminal responsibilities of hosting providers, site operators, and authors of libelous content; the minister declined to do so, recalling the existing rules in the LCEN law (see Internet censorship in France). [A question from Senator Jean-Louis Masson to the Minister of Justice, and the Minister's response] On August 25, 2010, the Toronto Star reported that the Canadian \\"government is now conducting two investigations into federal employees who have taken to Wikipedia to express their opinion on federal policies and bitter political debates.\\" In 2010, Al Jazeera's Teymoor Nabili suggested that the article Cyrus Cylinder had been edited for political purposes by \\"an apparent tussle of opinions in the shadowy world of hard drives and 'independent' editors that comprise the Wikipedia industry.\\" He suggested that, after the Iranian presidential election of 2009 and ensuing \\"anti-Iranian activities\\", a \\"strenuous attempt to portray the cylinder as nothing more than the propaganda tool of an aggressive invader\\" was visible. The edits following his analysis of the edits during 2009 and 2010, represented \\"a complete dismissal of the suggestion that the cylinder, or Cyrus' actions, represent concern for human rights or any kind of enlightened intent,\\" in stark contrast to Cyrus' own reputation as documented in the Old Testament and the people of Babylon. Commandeering or sanitizing articles Articles of particular interest to an editor or group of editors are sometimes modified based on these editors' respective points of views. Some companies and organizations‚Äîsuch as Sony, Diebold, Nintendo, Dell, the CIA, and the Church of Scientology‚Äîas well as individuals, such as United States Congressional staffers, were all shown to have modified the Wikipedia pages about themselves in order to present a point of view that describes them positively; these organizations may have editors who revert negative changes as soon as these changes are submitted. \\"Organizations like Sony, Diebold, Nintendo, Dell, the CIA and the Church of Scientology were all shown to have sanitized pages about themselves.\\" The Chinese Wikipedia article on Tiananmen Square massacre was rewritten to describe it as necessary to \\"quell the counterrevolutionary riots\\" and Taiwan was described as \\"a province in the People‚Äôs Republic of China\\". According to the BBC, \\"there are indications that [such edits] are not all necessarily organic, nor random\\" and were in fact orchestrated by the Chinese Communist Party. =Quality of the presentation= Quality of articles on U.S. history In the essay, \\"Can History be Open Source?: Wikipedia and the Future of the Past\\" (2006), the academic historian Roy Rosenzweig criticized the encyclopedic content and writing style used in Wikipedia, for not distinguishing subjects that are important from subjects that are merely sensational; that Wikipedia is \\"surprisingly accurate in reporting names, dates, and events in U.S. history\\"; and that most of the factual errors he found \\"were small and inconsequential\\", some of which \\"simply repeat widely held, but inaccurate, beliefs\\", which are also repeated in the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia and in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Yet Rosenzweig's major criticism is that: > Good historical writing requires not just factual accuracy but also a > command of the scholarly literature, persuasive analysis and > interpretations, and clear and engaging prose. By those measures, American > National Biography Online easily outdistances Wikipedia. Rosenzweig also criticized the \\"waffling encouraged by the [neutral point of view] policy [which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history [articles]\\", and quoted the historical conclusion of the biography of William Clarke Quantrill, a Confederate guerrilla in the United States Civil War, as an example of weasel-word waffling: > Some historians... remember [Quantrill] as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty > outlaw, while other [historians] continue to view him as a daring soldier > and local folk hero. Rosenzweig contrasted Wikipedia's Abraham Lincoln article with that of James M. McPherson in American National Biography Online. He reports that each entry was essentially accurate in covering the major episodes of President Lincoln's life. McPherson‚Äîa Princeton professor and winner of the Pulitzer Prize‚Äîshowed \\"richer contextualization\\", as well as \\"his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln‚Äôs voice\\" and \\"his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.\\" By contrast Wikipedia's prose was \\"both verbose and dull\\" and thus difficult to read, because \\"the skill and confident judgment of a seasoned historian\\" are absent from the antiquarian writing style of Wikipedia, as opposed to the writing style used by professional historians in the American Heritage magazine. It was also mentioned that while Wikipedia usually provides many references, these are not the most accurate references. (Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media) Quality of medical articles In the article \\"Wikipedia Cancer Information Accurate,\\" a study of medical articles, Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center of Thomas Jefferson University found that the cancer entries were mostly accurate. However, Wikipedia's articles were written in college-level prose, as opposed to in the easier-to-understand ninth-grade-level prose found in the Physician Data Query (PDQ) of the National Cancer Institute. According to Lawrence, \\"Wikipedia‚Äôs lack of readability may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing.\\" In its 2007 article \\"Fact or Fiction? Wikipedia‚Äôs Variety of Contributors is Not Only a Strength,\\" the magazine The Economist said the quality of the writing in Wikipedia articles usually indicates the quality of the editorial content: \\"Inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information.\\" The Wall Street Journal debate In the September 12, 2006, edition of The Wall Street Journal, Jimmy Wales debated with Dale Hoiberg, editor-in-chief of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Hoiberg focused on a need for expertise and control in an encyclopedia and cited Lewis Mumford that overwhelming information could \\"bring about a state of intellectual enervation and depletion hardly to be distinguished from massive ignorance.\\" Wales emphasized Wikipedia's differences, and asserted that openness and transparency lead to quality. Hoiberg said he \\"had neither the time nor space to respond to [criticisms]\\" and \\"could corral any number of links to articles alleging errors in Wikipedia\\", to which Wales responded: \\"No problem! Wikipedia to the rescue with a fine article\\", and included a link to the Wikipedia article about criticism of Wikipedia. =Systemic bias in coverage= Wikipedia has been accused of systemic bias, which is to say its general nature leads, without necessarily any conscious intention, to the propagation of various prejudices. Although many articles in newspapers have concentrated on minor factual errors in Wikipedia articles, there are also concerns about large-scale, presumably unintentional effects from the increasing influence and use of Wikipedia as a research tool at all levels. In an article in the Times Higher Education magazine (London) philosopher Martin Cohen describes Wikipedia as having \\"become a monopoly\\" with \\"all the prejudices and ignorance of its creators,\\" which he calls a \\"youthful cab- driver's\\" perspective. Cohen concludes that \\"[t]o control the reference sources that people use is to control the way people comprehend the world. Wikipedia may have a benign, even trivial face, but underneath may lie a more sinister and subtle threat to freedom of thought.\\" That freedom is undermined by what he sees as what matters on Wikipedia, \\"not your sources but the 'support of the community'.\\" Researchers from Washington University developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact. Critics also point to the tendency to cover topics in detail disproportionate to their importance. For example, Stephen Colbert once mockingly praised Wikipedia for having a longer entry on 'lightsabers' than it does on the 'printing press'.Stephen Colbert. The Colbert Report episode 3109. August 21, 2007. The editor-in-chief of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, said \\"People write of things they're interested in, and so many subjects don't get covered; and news events get covered in great detail. In the past, the entry on Hurricane Frances was more than five times the length of that on Chinese art, and the entry on Coronation Street was twice as long as the article on Tony Blair.\\" This approach of comparing two articles, one about a traditionally encyclopedic subject and the other about one more popular with the crowd, has been called \\"wikigroaning\\". A defense of inclusion criteria is that the encyclopedia's longer coverage of pop culture does not deprive the more \\"worthy\\" or serious subjects of space. In 2014, supporters of holistic healing and energy psychology began a change.org petition asking for \\"true scientific discourse\\" on Wikipedia, complaining that \\"much of the information [on Wikipedia] related to holistic approaches to healing is biased, misleading, out-of-date, or just plain wrong\\". In response, Jimmy Wales said Wikipedia covers only works that are published in respectable scientific journals. Notability of article topics Wikipedia's notability guidelines, which are used by editors to determine if a subject merits its own article, and the application thereof, are the subject of much criticism. A Wikipedia editor rejected a draft article about Donna Strickland before she won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018, because no independent sources were given to show that Strickland was sufficiently notable by Wikipedia's standards. Journalists highlighted this as an indicator of the limited visibility of women in science compared to their male colleagues. The gender bias on Wikipedia is well documented and has prompted a movement to increase the number of notable females on Wikipedia through the Women in Red Wikiproject. In an article entitled \\"Seeking Disambiguation\\", Annalisa Merelli interviewed a candidate for office in Queens in the 2018 election who had the notorious SEO disadvantage of having the same name as a porn star with a Wikipedia page. Merelli also interviewed the Wikipedia editor who wrote the candidate's ill-fated article (which was deleted, then restored, after she won the election). She described the Articles for Deletion process, and pointed to other candidates who had pages on en.wp, despite never having held office or having the handicap of Google syndicating pornstar infoboxes through its knowledge graph. Novelist Nicholson Baker, critical of deletionism, writes: \\"There are quires, reams, bales of controversy over what constitutes notability in Wikipedia: nobody will ever sort it out.\\" Journalist Timothy Noah wrote of his treatment: \\"Wikipedia's notability policy resembles U.S. immigration policy before 9/11: stringent rules, spotty enforcement\\". In the same article, Noah mentions that the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Stacy Schiff was not considered notable enough for a Wikipedia entry until she wrote her article \\"Know it All\\" about the Wikipedia Essjay controversy. On a more generic level, a 2014 study found no correlation between characteristics of a given Wikipedia page about an academic and the academic's notability as determined by citation counts. The metrics of each Wikipedia page examined included length, number of links to the page from other articles, and number of edits made to the page. This study also found that Wikipedia did not cover notable ISI highly cited researchers properly. Partisanship U.S. commentators, mostly politically conservative ones, have suggested that a politically liberal viewpoint is predominant. Andrew Schlafly created Conservapedia because of his perception that Wikipedia contained a liberal bias. Conservapedia's editors have compiled a list of alleged examples of liberal bias in Wikipedia. In 2007, an article in The Christian Post criticised Wikipedia's coverage of intelligent design, saying it was biased and hypocritical. Lawrence Solomon of National Review considered the Wikipedia articles on subjects like global warming, intelligent design, and Roe v. Wade all to be slanted in favor of liberal views. In a September 2010 issue of the conservative weekly Human Events, Rowan Scarborough presented a critique of Wikipedia's coverage of American politicians prominent in the approaching midterm elections as evidence of systemic liberal bias. Scarborough compares the biographical articles of liberal and conservative opponents in Senate races in the Alaska Republican primary and the Delaware and Nevada general election, emphasizing the quantity of negative coverage of Tea Party-endorsed candidates. He also cites criticism by Lawrence Solomon and quotes in full the lead section of Wikipedia's article on Conservapedia as evidence of an underlying bias. In 2006, Jimmy Wales said, \\"The Wikipedia community is very diverse, from liberal to conservative to libertarian and beyond. If averages mattered, and due to the nature of the wiki software (no voting) they almost certainly don't, I would say that the Wikipedia community is slightly more liberal than the U.S. population on average, because we are global and the international community of English speakers is slightly more liberal than the U.S. population. There are no data or surveys to back that.\\" Shane Greenstein and Feng Zhu analyzed 2012 era Wikipedia articles on U.S. politics, going back a decade, and wrote a study arguing the more contributors there were to an article, the less biased the article would be, and that based on a study of frequent collocations fewer articles \\"leaned Democrat\\" than was the case in Wikipedia's early years. Sorin Adam Matei, a professor at Purdue University, said that \\"for certain political topics, there's a central-left bias. There's also a slight, when it comes to more political topics, counter-cultural bias. It's not across the board, and it's not for all things.\\" National or corporate bias In January 2007 Rick Jelliffe said Microsoft had offered him compensation in exchange for his future editorial services on Wikipedia's articles related to Office Open Extensible Markup Language. A Microsoft spokesperson said \\"Microsoft and the writer, Rick Jelliffe, had not determined a price and no money had changed hands‚Äîbut they had agreed that the company would not be allowed to review his writing before submission\\". Jimmy Wales, also quoted by CBS, expressed his disapproval of Microsoft's involvement: \\"We were very disappointed to hear that Microsoft was taking that approach\\". In 2008 Tim Anderson, a senior lecturer in political economy at the University of Sydney, said Wikipedia administrators display an American-focused bias in their interactions with editors and their determinations of which sources are appropriate for use on the site. Anderson was outraged after several of the sources he used in his edits to the Hugo Ch√°vez article, including Venezuela Analysis and Z Magazine, were disallowed as \\"unusable\\". Anderson also described Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy to ZDNet Australia as \\"a facade\\" and that Wikipedia \\"hides behind a reliance on corporate media editorials\\". In 2017, Burger King and The Verge were both involved in manipulating a Wikipedia entry in an effort to influence what Google Home would say when asked about Whoppers. In 2019, the CEO of North Face Brazil explained to Ad Age how they achieved product positioning goals in 2019 by replacing images in Wikipedia articles about places with photos of athletes wearing the brand trekking through the places. In an interview given to Index.hr, Robert Kureliƒá, a professor of history at the Juraj Dobrila University of Pula, has commented that \\"the Croatian Wikipedia is only a tool used by its administrators to promote their own political agendas, giving false and distorted facts\\". As two particularly prominent examples he listed the Croatian Wikipedia's coverage of the term Istrijanstvo (Istrian regionalism), defined as a \\"movement fabricated to reduce the number of Croats\\", and antifa≈°izam (anti-fascism), which according to him is defined as the opposite of what it really means. Kureliƒá further advised \\"that it would be good if a larger number of people got engaged and started writing on Wikipedia\\", because \\"administrators want to exploit high-school and university students, the most common users of Wikipedia, to change their opinions and attitudes, which presents a serious issue\\". In 2013, Croatia's Minister of Science, Education and Sports, ≈Ωeljko Jovanoviƒá, called for pupils and students in Croatia to avoid using the Croatian Wikipedia. In an interview given to Novi list, Jovanoviƒá said that \\"the idea of openness and relevance as a knowledge source that Wikipedia could and should represent has been completely discredited ‚Äì which, for certain, has never been the goal of Wikipedia's creators nor the huge number of people around the world who share their knowledge and time using that medium. Croatian pupils and students have been wronged by this, so we have to warn them, unfortunately, that a large part of the content of the Croatian version of Wikipedia is not only dubious but also [contains] obvious forgeries, and therefore we invite them to use more reliable sources of information, which include Wikipedia in English and in other major languages of the world.\\" Jovanoviƒá has also commented on the Croatian Wikipedia editors ‚Äì calling them a \\"minority group that has usurped the right to edit the Croatian-language Wikipedia\\". Racial bias Wikipedia has been criticized for having a systemic racial bias in its coverage, due to an under-representation of people of colour within its editor base. The President of Wikimedia D.C., James Hare, noted that \\"a lot of black history is left out\\" of Wikipedia, due to articles predominately being written by white editors. Articles that do exist on African topics are, according to some critics, largely edited by editors from Europe and North America and thus reflect their knowledge and consumption of media, which \\"tend to perpetuate a negative image\\" of Africa. Maira Liriano, of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, has argued that the lack of information regarding black history on Wikipedia \\"makes it seem like it's not important.\\" San Francisco Poet Laureate Alejandro Murgu√≠a has stressed how it is important for Latinos to be part of Wikipedia \\"because it is a major source of where people get their information.\\" In 2018 the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized Wikipedia for being \\"vulnerable to manipulation by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and racist academics seeking a wider audience for extreme views.\\" According to the SPLC, \\"Civil POV-pushers can disrupt the editing process by engaging other users in tedious and frustrating debates or tie up administrators in endless rounds of mediation. Users who fall into this category include racialist academics and members of the human biodiversity, or HBD, blogging community... In recent years, the proliferation of far-right online spaces, such as white nationalist forums, alt-right boards and HBD blogs, has created a readymade pool of users that can be recruited to edit on Wikipedia en masse... The presence of white nationalists and other far-right extremists on Wikipedia is an ongoing problem that is unlikely to go away in the near future given the rightward political shift in countries where the majority of the site‚Äôs users live.\\" The SPLC cited the article Race and intelligence as an example of the alt-right influence on Wikipedia, stating that at that time the article presented a \\"false balance\\" between fringe racialist views and the \\"mainstream perspective in psychology.\\" Gender bias and sexism Former Wikimedia Foundation executive Sue Gardner has listed reasons offered by some women in \\"Why Women Don't Edit Wikipedia\\". Wikipedia has a longstanding controversy concerning gender bias and sexism. Gender bias on Wikipedia refers to the finding that between 84 and 91 percent of Wikipedia editors are male,Statistics based on Wikimedia Foundation Wikipedia editor surveys 2011 (Nov. 2010-April 2011) and November 2011 (April - October 2011) which allegedly leads to systemic bias. Wikipedia has been criticized by some journalists and academics for lacking not only women contributors but also extensive and in-depth encyclopedic attention to many topics regarding gender. Sue Gardner, former executive director of the Foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia \\"as good as it could be\\". Factors cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the \\"obsessive fact-loving realm\\", associations with the \\"hard-driving hacker crowd\\", and the necessity to be \\"open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists.\\" In 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation set a goal of increasing the proportion of female contributors to 25 percent by 2015. In August 2013, Gardner conceded defeat: \\"I didn't solve it. We didn't solve it. The Wikimedia Foundation didn't solve it. The solution won't come from the Wikimedia Foundation.\\" In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales acknowledged in a BBC interview the failure of Wikipedia to fix the gender gap and announced the Wikimedia Foundation's plans for \\"doubling down\\" on the issue. Wales said the Foundation would be open to more outreach and more software changes.Wikipedia 'completely failed' to fix gender imbalance , BBC interview with Jimmy Wales, August 8, 2014; starting at 45 seconds. Writing in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society, Marie Vitulli states that \\"mathematicians have had a difficult time when writing biographies of women mathematicians,\\" and she describes the aggressiveness of editors and administrators in deleting such articles. Criticism was presented on this topic in the Signpost (WP:THREATENING2MEN). Firearms-related articles Wikipedia has been criticized for issues related to bias in firearms-related articles. According to critics, systematic bias arises from the tendency of the editors most active in maintaining firearms-related articles to also be gun enthusiasts, and firearms-related articles are dominated by technical information while issues of the social impact and regulation of firearms are relegated to separate articles. Communications were facilitated by a \\"WikiProject,\\" called \\"WikiProject Firearms\\", an on-wiki group of editors with a common interest. The alleged pro-gun bias drew increased attention after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida in February, 2018. The Wikimedia Foundation defended itself from allegations of being host to opinion-influencing campaigns of pro-gun groups, saying that the contents are always being updated and improved. =Sexual content= Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing graphic sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation as well as photos from hardcore pornographic films found on its articles. Child protection campaigners say graphic sexual content appears on many Wikipedia entries, displayed without any warning or age verification. The Wikipedia article Virgin Killer‚Äîa 1976 album from German heavy metal band Scorpions‚Äîfeatures a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. In December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit, nongovernment-affiliated organization, added the article to its blacklist, criticizing the inclusion of the picture as \\"distasteful\\". As a result, access to the article was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom. Seth Finkelstein writing for The Guardian argues that the debate over the album cover masks a structural lack of accountability on Wikipedia, in particular when it comes to sexual content. For example, the deletion by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales of images of lolicon versions of the character Wikipe-tan created a minor controversy on the topic. The deletion was taken as endorsement of the non- lolicon images of Wikipe-tan, which Wales later had to explicitly deny: \\"I don't like Wikipe-tan and never have.\\" Finkelstein sees Wikipedia as composed of fiefdoms, which makes it difficult for the Wikipedia community to deal with such issues, and sometimes necessitates top-down intervention. In April 2010, Larry Sanger, a co-founder of Wikipedia who had left the organization eight years previously, wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of United States federal obscenity law. Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. Sanger later said it was probably not correct to call it \\"child pornography\\", which most people associate with images of real children, and that he should have said \\"depictions of child sexual abuse\\". Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh said Wikipedia does not have \\"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\\" Following the complaint by Sanger, Jimmy Wales deleted many sexual images without consulting the community; some were reinstated following discussion. Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the sexual images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. =Exposure to vandals= Vandalism of a Wikipedia article As an online encyclopedia which almost anyone can edit, Wikipedia has had problems with vandalism of articles, which range from blanking articles to inserting profanities, hoaxes, or nonsense. Wikipedia has a range of tools available to users and administrators in order to fight against vandalism, including blocking and banning of vandals and automated bots that detect and repair vandalism. Supporters of the project argue that the vast majority of vandalism on Wikipedia is reverted within a short time, and a study by Fernanda Vi√©gas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM Research found that most vandal edits were reverted within around five minutes; however they state that \\"it is essentially impossible to find a crisp definition of vandalism\\" While most instances of page blanking or the addition of offensive material are soon reverted, less obvious vandalism, or vandalism to a little viewed article, has remained for longer periods. A 2007 conference paper estimated that 1 in 271 articles had some \\"damaged\\" content. Most of the damage involved nonsense; 20% involved actual misinformation. It reported that 42% of damage gets repaired before any reader clicked on the article, and 80% before 30 people did so. online =Privacy concerns= Most privacy concerns refer to cases of government or employer data gathering; or to computer or electronic monitoring; or to trading data between organizations. \\"The Internet has created conflicts between personal privacy, commercial interests and the interests of society at large\\" warn James Donnelly and Jenifer Haeckl. Balancing the rights of all concerned as technology alters the social landscape will not be easy. It \\"is not yet possible to anticipate the path of the common law or governmental regulation\\" regarding this problem. The concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain private; to remain a \\"private citizen\\" rather than a \\"public figure\\" in the eyes of the law.See \\"Public and Private Figures\\" by the Digital Media Law Project for the legal distinction. It is somewhat of a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life (\\"meatspace\\"). A particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against their wishes. In 2005 Agence France-Presse quoted Daniel Brandt, the Wikipedia Watch owner, as saying that \\"the basic problem is that no one, neither the trustees of Wikimedia Foundation, nor the volunteers who are connected with Wikipedia, consider themselves responsible for the content.\\" In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka \\"Tron\\", a deceased hacker who was formerly with the Chaos Computer Club. More specifically, the court ordered that the URL within the German domain () may no longer redirect to the encyclopedia's servers in Florida at although German readers were still able to use the US-based URL directly, and there was virtually no loss of access on their part. The court order arose out of a lawsuit filed by Floricic's parents, demanding that their son's surname be removed from Wikipedia. The next month on February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents were being violated. Criticism of the community =Role of Jimmy Wales= The community of Wikipedia editors has been criticized for placing an irrational emphasis on Jimmy Wales as a person. Wales's role in personally determining the content of some articles has also been criticized as contrary to the independent spirit that Wikipedia supposedly has gained. In early 2007, Wales dismissed the criticism of the Wikipedia model: \\"I am unaware of any problems with the quality of discourse on the site. I don't know of any higher-quality discourse anywhere.\\" =Conflict of interest cases= A Business Insider article wrote about a controversy in September 2012 where two Wikimedia Foundation employees were found to have been \\"running a PR business on the side and editing Wikipedia on behalf of their clients.\\" =Unfair treatment of women= In 2015, The Atlantic published a story by Emma Paling about a contributor who was able to obtain no relief from the Arbitration Committee for off-wiki harassment. Paling quotes a then-sitting Arbitrator speaking about bias against women on the Arbitration Committee. In the online magazine Slate, David Auerbach criticized the Arbitration Committee's decision to block a woman indefinitely without simultaneously blocking her \\"chief antagonists\\" in the December 2014 Gender Gap Task Force case. He mentions his own experience with what he calls \\"the unblockables\\"abrasive editors who can get away with complaints against them because there are enough supporters, and that he had observed a \\"general indifference or even hostility to outside opinion\\" on the English Wikipedia. Auerbach considers the systematic defense of vulgar language use by insiders as a symptom of the toxicity he describes. In January 2015, The Guardian reported that the Arbitration Committee had banned five feminist editors from gender-related articles on a case related to the Gamergate controversy, while including quotes from a Wikipedia editor alleging unfair treatment. Other commentators, including from Gawker and ThinkProgress, provided additional analysis while sourcing from The Guardians story. Reports in The Washington Post, Slate and Social Text described these articles as \\"flawed\\" or factually inaccurate, pointing out that the Arbitration case had not concluded as at the time of publishing; no editor had been banned. After the result was published, Gawker wrote that \\"ArbCom ruled to punish six editors who could be broadly classified as 'anti-Gamergate' and five who are 'pro-Gamergate'.\\" All of the supposed were among the editors punished, with one of them being the sole editor banned due to this case. An article called \\"ArbitrationGate\\" regarding this situation was created (and quickly deleted) on Wikipedia, while The Guardian later issued a correction to their article. The Committee and the Wikimedia Foundation issued press statements that the Gamergate case was in response to the atmosphere of the Gamergate article resembling a \\"battlefield\\" due to \\"various sides of the discussion [having] violated community policies and guidelines on conduct\\", and that the committee was fulfilling its role to \\"uphold a civil, constructive atmosphere\\" on Wikipedia. The committee also wrote that it \\"does not rule on the content of articles, or make judgements on the personal views of parties to the case\\". Michael Mandiberg, writing in Social Text, remained unconvinced. =Lack of verifiable identities= Scandals involving administrators and arbitrators David Boothroyd, a Wikipedia editor and a Labour Party (United Kingdom) member, created controversy in 2009, when Wikipedia Review contributor \\"Tarantino\\" discovered that he committed sockpuppeting, editing under the accounts \\"Dbiv\\", \\"Fys\\", and \\"Sam Blacketer\\", none of which acknowledged his real identity. After earning Administrator status with one account, then losing it for inappropriate use of the administrative tools, Boothroyd regained Administrator status with the Sam Blacketer sockpuppet account in April 2007. Later in 2007, Boothroyd's Sam Blacketer account became part of the English Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee. Under the Sam Blacketer account, Boothroyd edited many articles related to United Kingdom politics, including that of rival Conservative Party leader David Cameron. Boothroyd then resigned as an administrator and as an arbitrator. Essjay controversy Essjay In July 2006 The New Yorker ran a feature by Stacy Schiff about \\"a highly credentialed Wikipedia editor\\". The initial version of the article included an interview with a Wikipedia administrator using the pseudonym Essjay, who described himself as a tenured professor of theology. At some point, Essjay said he had sent a letter to a real-life college professor using his invented persona's credentials, vouching for Wikipedia's accuracy. In the letter he wrote in part, \\"It is never the case that known incorrect information is allowed to remain in Wikipedia.\\" Essjay's Wikipedia user page, now removed, said the following: > I am a tenured professor of theology at a private university in the eastern > United States; I teach both undergraduate and graduate theology. I have been > asked repeatedly to reveal the name of the institution, however, I decline > to do so; I am unsure of the consequences of such an action, and believe it > to be in my best interests to remain anonymous. Essjay also said he held four academic degrees: Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies (B.A.), Master of Arts in Religion (M.A.R.), Doctorate of Philosophy in Theology (Ph.D.), and Doctorate in Canon Law (JCD). Essjay specialized in editing articles about religion on Wikipedia, including subjects such as \\"the penitential rite, transubstantiation, the papal tiara\\"; on one occasion he was called in to give some \\"expert testimony\\" on the status of Mary in the Roman Catholic Church. In January 2007, Essjay was hired as a manager with Wikia, a wiki-hosting service founded by Wales and Angela Beesley. In February, Wales appointed Essjay as a member of the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee, a group with powers to issue binding rulings in disputes relating to Wikipedia. Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger, who left Wikipedia to found Citizendium In late February 2007 The New Yorker added an editorial note to its article on Wikipedia stating that it had learned that Essjay was Ryan Jordan, a 24-year- old college dropout from Kentucky with no advanced degrees and no teaching experience. Initially Jimmy Wales commented on the issue of Essjay's identity: \\"I regard it as a pseudonym and I don't really have a problem with it.\\" Larry Sanger, co-founder \\"I can start an article that will consist of one paragraph, and then a real expert will come along and add three paragraphs and clean up my one paragraph\\", said Larry Sanger of Las Vegas, who founded Wikipedia with Mr. Wales. of Wikipedia, responded to Wales on his Citizendium blog by calling Wales' initial reaction \\"utterly breathtaking, and ultimately tragic\\". Sanger said the controversy \\"reflects directly on the judgment and values of the management of Wikipedia.\\" Wales later issued a new statement saying he had not previously understood that \\"EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes.\\" He added: \\"I have asked EssJay to resign his positions of trust within the Wikipedia community.\\" Sanger responded the next day: \\"It seems Jimmy finds nothing wrong, nothing trust-violating, with the act itself of openly and falsely touting many advanced degrees on Wikipedia. But there most obviously is something wrong with it, and it's just as disturbing for Wikipedia's head to fail to see anything wrong with it.\\" On March 4, Essjay wrote on his user page that he was leaving Wikipedia, and he also resigned his position with Wikia. A subsequent article in The Courier-Journal (Louisville) suggested that the new r√©sum√© he had posted at his Wikia page was exaggerated. Alt URL The March 19, 2007 issue of The New Yorker published a formal apology by Wales to the magazine and Stacy Schiff for Essjay's false statements. Discussing the incident, the New York Times noted that the Wikipedia community had responded to the affair with \\"the fury of the crowd\\", and observed: > The Essjay episode underlines some of the perils of collaborative efforts > like Wikipedia that rely on many contributors acting in good faith, often > anonymously and through self-designated user names. But it also shows how > the transparency of the Wikipedia process‚Äîall editing of entries is marked > and saved‚Äîallows readers to react to suspected fraud. The Essjay incident received extensive media coverage, including a national United States television broadcast on ABC's World News with Charles Gibson and the March 7, 2007, Associated Press story. The controversy has led to a proposal that users who say they possess academic qualifications should have to provide evidence before citing them in Wikipedia content disputes. The proposal was not accepted. Anonymity Wikipedia has been criticised for allowing editors to contribute anonymously (without a registered account and using an auto-generated IP-labeled account) or pseudonymously (using a registered account), with critics saying that this leads to a lack of accountability. This also sometimes leads to uncivil conduct in debates between Wikipedians. For privacy reasons, Wikipedia forbids editors to reveal information about an anonymous editor on Wikipedia. Criticism of process =Level of debate, edit wars and harassment= The standard of debate on Wikipedia has been called into question by people who have noted that contributors can make a long list of salient points and pull in a wide range of empirical observations to back up their arguments, only to have them ignored completely on the site. An academic study of Wikipedia articles found that the level of debate among Wikipedia editors on controversial topics often degenerated into counterproductive squabbling: > For uncontroversial, \\"stable\\" topics self-selection also ensures that > members of editorial groups are substantially well-aligned with each other > in their interests, backgrounds, and overall understanding of the topics... > For controversial topics, on the other hand, self-selection may produce a > strongly misaligned editorial group. It can lead to conflicts among the > editorial group members, continuous edit wars, and may require the use of > formal work coordination and control mechanisms. These may include > intervention by administrators who enact dispute review and mediation > processes, [or] completely disallow or limit and coordinate the types and > sources of edits. [\\"Information Quality Work Organization in Wikipedia\\" at > Wiley Online Library] In 2008, a team from the Palo Alto Research Center found that for editors who make between two and nine edits a month, the percentage of their edits being reverted had gone from 5% in 2004 to about 15%, and people who make only one edit a month were being reverted at a 25% rate. According to The Economist magazine (2008), \\"The behaviour of Wikipedia's self-appointed deletionist guardians, who excise anything that does not meet their standards, justifying their actions with a blizzard of acronyms, is now known as 'wiki-lawyering'.\\" In regards to the decline in the number of Wikipedia editors since the 2007 policy changes, another study stated this was partly down to the way \\"in which newcomers are rudely greeted by automated quality control systems and are overwhelmed by the complexity of the rule system.\\" Another complaint about Wikipedia focuses on the efforts of contributors with idiosyncratic beliefs, who push their point of view in an effort to dominate articles, especially controversial ones. This sometimes results in revert wars and pages being locked down. In response, an Arbitration Committee has been formed on the English Wikipedia that deals with the worst alleged offenders‚Äîthough a conflict resolution strategy is actively encouraged before going to this extent. Also, to stop the continuous reverting of pages, Jimmy Wales introduced a \\"three-revert rule\\", whereby those users who reverse the effect of others' contributions to one article more than three times in a 24-hour period may be blocked. In a 2008 article in The Brooklyn Rail, Wikipedia contributor David Shankbone contended that he had been harassed and stalked because of his work on Wikipedia, had received no support from the authorities or the Wikimedia Foundation, and only mixed support from the Wikipedia community. Shankbone wrote, \\"If you become a target on Wikipedia, do not expect a supportive community.\\" David Auerbach, writing in Slate magazine, said: > I am not exaggerating when I say it is the closest thing to Kafka‚Äôs The > Trial I have ever witnessed, with editors and administrators giving > conflicting and confusing advice, complaints getting \\"boomeranged\\" onto > complainants who then face disciplinary action for complaining, and very > little consistency in the standards applied. In my short time there, I > repeatedly observed editors lawyering an issue with acronyms, only to turn > around and declare \\"Ignore all rules!\\" when faced with the same rules used > against them... The problem instead stems from the fact that administrators > and longtime editors have developed a fortress mentality in which they see > new editors as dangerous intruders who will wreck their beautiful > encyclopedia, and thus antagonize and even persecute them. Wikipedia has also been criticised for its weak enforcement against perceived toxicities among the editing community at various times. In one case a longtime editor was nearly driven to suicide following an online abuse from editors and a ban from the site before being rescued from the suicide attempt. In order to address this problem Wikipedia planned to institute a new rule of conduct aimed at combating 'toxic behavior'. The development of the new rule of conduct would take place in two phases. The first will include setting policies for in-person and virtual events as well as policies for technical spaces including chat rooms and other Wikimedia projects. A second phase outlining enforcement when the rules are broken is planned to be approved by the end of 2020, according to Wikimedia board's plan. =Consensus and the \\"hive mind\\"= Oliver Kamm, in an article for The Times, said Wikipedia's reliance on consensus in forming its content was dubious: > Wikipedia seeks not truth but consensus, and like an interminable political > meeting the end result will be dominated by the loudest and most persistent > voices. Wikimedia advisor Benjamin Mako Hill also talked about Wikipedia's disproportional representation of viewpoints, saying: > In Wikipedia, debates can be won by stamina. If you care more and argue > longer, you will tend to get your way. The result, very often, is that > individuals and organizations with a very strong interest in having > Wikipedia say a particular thing tend to win out over other editors who just > want the encyclopedia to be solid, neutral, and reliable. These less- > committed editors simply have less at stake and their attention is more > distributed. Wikimedia trustee Dariusz Jemielniak says: > Tiring out one's opponent is a common strategy among experienced > Wikipedians... I have resorted to it many times. In his article, \\"Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism\\" (first published online by Edge: The Third Culture, May 30, 2006), computer scientist and digital theorist Jaron Lanier describes Wikipedia as a \\"hive mind\\" that is \\"for the most part stupid and boring\\", and asks, rhetorically, \\"why pay attention to it?\\" His thesis says: > The problem is in the way the Wikipedia has come to be regarded and used; > how it's been elevated to such importance so quickly. And that is part of > the larger pattern of the appeal of a new online collectivism that is > nothing less than a resurgence of the idea that the collective is all-wise, > that it is desirable to have influence concentrated in a bottleneck that can > channel the collective with the most verity and force. This is different > from representative democracy, or meritocracy. This idea has had dreadful > consequences when thrust upon us from the extreme Right or the extreme Left > in various historical periods. The fact that it's now being re-introduced > today by prominent technologists and futurists, people who in many cases I > know and like, doesn't make it any less dangerous. Lanier also says the current economic trend is to reward entities that aggregate information, rather than those that actually generate content. In the absence of \\"new business models\\", the popular demand for content will be sated by mediocrity, thus reducing or even eliminating any monetary incentives for the production of new knowledge. Lanier's opinions produced some strong disagreement. Internet consultant Clay Shirky noted that Wikipedia has many internal controls in place and is not a mere mass of unintelligent collective effort: > Neither proponents nor detractors of hive mind rhetoric have much > interesting to say about Wikipedia itself, because both groups ignore the > details... Wikipedia is best viewed as an engaged community that uses a > large and growing number of regulatory mechanisms to manage a huge set of > proposed edits... To take the specific case of Wikipedia, the > Seigenthaler/Kennedy debacle catalyzed both soul-searching and new controls > to address the problems exposed, and the controls included, inter alia, a > greater focus on individual responsibility, the very factor \\"Digital Maoism\\" > denies is at work. =Excessive rule-making= Various figures involved with the Wikimedia Foundation have argued that Wikipedia's increasingly complex policies and guidelines are driving away new contributors to the site. Former chair Kat Walsh has criticized the project in recent years, saying, \\"It was easier when I joined in 2004... Everything was a little less complicated... It's harder and harder for new people to adjust.\\" Wikipedia administrator Oliver Moran views \\"policy creep\\" as the major barrier, writing that \\"the loose collective running the site today, estimated to be 90 percent male, operates a crushing bureaucracy with an often abrasive atmosphere that deters newcomers who might increase participation in Wikipedia and broaden its coverage\\". According to Jemielniak, the sheer complexity of the rules and laws governing content and editor behavior has become excessive and creates a learning burden for new editors. In a 2013 study, Aaron Halfaker of the University of Minnesota concluded the same thing. Jemielniak suggests actively rewriting, and abridging, the rules and laws to decrease their complexity and size. =Social stratification= Despite the perception that the Wikipedia process is democratic, \\"a small number of people are running the show\\", including administrators, bureaucrats, stewards, checkusers, mediators, arbitrators, and oversighters. In an article on Wikipedia conflicts in 2007, The Guardian discussed \\"a backlash among some editors, who say that blocking users compromises the supposedly open nature of the project and the imbalance of power between users and administrators may even be a reason some users choose to vandalize in the first place\\" based on the experiences of one editor who became a vandal after his edits were reverted and he was blocked for edit warring.

For the Monnet plan of 1950, see European Coal and Steel Community. UK map of the French proposals, created April 1946. The Ruhr Area is to be extended to the Dutch border by incorporating parts of the Rhineland, and the whole new territory shall then be detached from Germany. The Monnet plan was proposed by French civil servant Jean Monnet after the end of World War II. It was a reconstruction plan for France that proposed giving France control over the German coal and steel areas of the Ruhr area and Saar and using these resources to bring France to 150% of pre-war industrial production. The plan was adopted by Charles de Gaulle in early 1946. The plan would permanently limit German economic capacity, and greatly increase French power. Background The early French plans were concerned with keeping Germany weak and strengthening the French economy at the expense of that of Germany. French foreign policy aimed to dismantle German heavy industry, place the coal rich Ruhr area and Rhineland under French control or at a minimum internationalize them, and also to join the coal-rich Saarland with the iron-rich province of Lorraine (which had been handed over from Germany to France again in 1944). When American diplomats reminded the French of what a devastating effect this would have on the German economy, France's response was to suggest the Germans would just have to \\"make [the] necessary adjustments\\" to deal with the inevitable foreign exchange deficit.  Five Year plans  The \\"Monnet Plan\\" (1946‚Äì1950) was in effect the first five-year plan for modernization and equipment, a plan for national economic reconstruction which drew heavily on earlier French plans to make France the largest steel producer in Europe. Monnet's aim was to modernize the French economy so as to make it internationally competitive, especially versus German exports. To carry out his plans he created the Planning Commissariat (Commissariat g√©n√©ral du Plan) and entrenched it in the French bureaucracy. Germany was seen as a necessary tool for carrying out the plans. The planned steel production increases to 15 million tonnes of steel a year could only be achieved by replacing former German steel exports and increasing the imports of German coal and coke, making control of this German resource vital.Alan S. Milward, \\"The Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1945‚Äì51\\" pp. 97‚Äì98 French proposals for the area spanned by the German coalfields east of the Rhine had since late 1945, therefore, been to turn it into an International State with its own currency and customs and supervised by an International Authority which would include the US and France. Part of the reason for these proposals was in 1946 explained to the US by a French Foreign Office official: \\"With the aim of military security we prefer to increase French steel production and output to the detriment of the Ruhr.\\" The French plans for industrial expansion required an additional 1,000,000 workers for 4 years, and France therefore planned on keeping for as long as possible the German prisoners employed in mining, agriculture, and rebuilding. SM Nr. 95/97 Issued by the London Representative of the German Social Democratic Party The UK and the US were generally reluctant to acquiesce to the French demands, since they feared it would lead to increased Russian influence. Monnet's memoirs show no hard evidence of an interest in European unity before April 1948, when he realized it was a central US objective.Alan S. Milward, George Brennan, Federico Romero \\"The European Rescue of the Nation-state: Second Edition\\" p.335 He then wrote to Schumann that to ward off the current dangers there was only one solution; it would \\"only be possible through the creation of a federation of the west\\". French foreign minister Robert Schuman stated in a speech that the Schuman plan in reality was the continuation of the Monnet plan, and that it was solely for the sake of supporting French steel exports that they had taken on that task.DER SCHUMANPLAN: DIE NEUE RUHRBEH√ñRDE Professor Dr. Hans Ritschl Der Spiegel 1951 According to Professor Dr. Hans Ritschl this speech was never intended to reach German ears.  The Saar Area  100 Saar franken coin In 1947 France detached the coal-rich Saar area from Germany and turned it into the Saar Protectorate under French economic control. The area returned to German administration on January 1, 1957, but France retained the right to mine from its coal mines until 1981. As a protectorate, the Saar area was economically integrated with France and nominally politically independent but security and foreign policy was dictated from France. In addition, France maintained a High Commissioner in the Saar with wide-ranging powers. The mining and steel industries were the main industries in the region. In 1946 France had claimed ownership of the mines, and also introduced a customs- border between the Saar and the rest of Germany. In 1947 the \\"Regie des Mines de la Sarre\\" took operative control of the Saar mining industry. During 1946 the output from the mines represented a third of the French coal-production and in 1949 a quarter of the French production. Without the coal from the Saar the French steel production would have been substantially lower.Stiftung Demokratie Saarland Dialog 15, S.12 Parties advocating a return of the Saar to Germany were banned, with the consequence that West Germany did not recognize the democratic legality of the Saar government. Konrad Adenauer stated \\"The term \\"protectorate\\" is too kind. One could rather speak of a 'colony' ‚Äì but this I will not do.\\" ‚Äì\\"Der Name‚Äö Protektorat' w√§re vielleicht noch zu gut. Man k√∂nnte eher von einer ‚ÄöKolonie' sprechen ‚Äì doch das werde ich nicht tun.\\"H.-P. Schwarz, Die √Ñra Adenauer 1949‚Äì1957, p.93 In view of continued conflict between Germany and France over the future of the Saarland, efforts were made by the other Western European nations to find a solution to the potentially dangerous problem. Placed under increasing international pressure, France finally agreed to a compromise. The Saar territory was to be Europeanised under the context of the Western European Union. France and Germany agreed in the Paris Agreements that until a peace treaty was signed with Germany, the Saar area would be governed under a \\"statute\\" that was to be supervised by a European Commissioner who in turn would be responsible to the Council of Ministers of the Western European Union. The Saarland would however have to remain in economic union with France.Yes or No, Time Magazine Monday, Oct. 17, 1955Bverfg No. 7 E 4, 157 1 BvF 1/55 \\"Saar Statute\\" Institute of Global Law, University College London (Google Cach√©) Despite the endorsement of the statute by West Germany, in the 1955 referendum amongst the Saarlanders that was needed for it to come into effect the statute was rejected by 67.7% of the population. Despite French pre-referendum assertions that a \\"no\\" to the statute would simply result in the Saarland remaining in its previous status as a French-controlled territory, the claim of the campaign group for a \\"no\\" to the statute that it would lead to unification with West Germany turned out to be correct. The Saarland was politically reintegrated with West Germany on 1 January 1957, but economic reintegration took many additional years. In return for agreeing to return the Saar, France demanded and gained the following concessions: * France was permitted to extract coal from the Warndt coal deposit until 1981. * Germany had to agree to the channelisation of the Moselle. This reduced French freight costs in the Lorraine steel industry. * Germany had to agree to the teaching of French as the first foreign language in schools in the Saarland. Although no longer binding, the agreement is still in the main followed.The issue of the Saar European NAvigator As one minor consequence of French efforts to Frenchify the territory, it was alone in the western occupied territories not to accept any refugees from the expulsions of Germans in the Eastern provinces and German settlements elsewhere in Eastern Europe. France did not wish to increase the German-speaking population in the territory. The Ruhr Area Map showing details of the French proposal for the detachment of the Ruhr area from Germany. In September 1946, the US government stated in the Stuttgart speech Restatement of Policy on Germany that it would accept the French demands on the Saarland, but that: \\"the United States will not support any encroachment on territory which is indisputably German or any division of Germany which is not genuinely desired by the people concerned. So far as the United States is aware the people of the Ruhr Area and the Rhineland desire to remain united with the rest of Germany. And the United States is not going to oppose their desire.\\" The U.S. was at this point in time becoming more concerned by the risk of West Germany slipping into the communist camp, and a detachment of the Ruhr from Germany was seen as dangerous from that standpoint. France had since the end of the war, based on the Monnet plan, repeatedly requested that the Ruhr be detached from Germany. Steel production in the Ruhr had resumed despite prohibitions and restrictions on production, and despite dismantling of manufacturing plants. With the preparations for the founding of West Germany, France renewed demands that the German coal and steel production in the Ruhr should be controlled. In 1949, the International Authority for the Ruhr was imposed on the (West) Germans as a pre-condition for permitting them to establish the Federal Republic of Germany.Amos Yoder, \\"The Ruhr Authority and the German Problem\\", \\"The Review of Politics\\", Vol. 17, No. 3 (July 1955), pp. 345‚Äì58 By controlling the production and distribution of coal and steel (i.e., how much coal and steel the Germans themselves would get), the International Authority for the Ruhr (IAR) in effect controlled the entire West German economy, much to the dismay of the Germans. Ludwig Erhard called the statute a \\"tragic error\\", which would have the consequence that \\"the living standards of the German people would no longer depend on German efforts, diligence and social policies, but would rather be in the hands of the competitors to German industry\\".Der Spiegel 2/1949 Industrial dismantling in the Ruhr continued also in 1949, with German workers protesting and trying to barricade factories slated for dismantling. The Germans were permitted to send their delegations to the Ruhr authority after signing the Petersberg agreement. The list of industries to be dismantled in the Ruhr was reduced as a consequence of the agreement, but dismantling continued until mid-1950. On November 24, two days after the Petersberg agreement, there was a heated debate in the German parliament as a consequence. Konrad Adenauer argued in defense of the agreement that had he done otherwise then within 8 weeks the industrial dismantling would have reached an unendurable level.Der Spiegel 49/1949 The opposition leader Kurt Schumacher responded by labeling Adenauer \\"Chancellor of the Allies\\". In 1951, West Germany agreed to join the European Coal and Steel Community, in order to lift the industrial restrictions imposed by the International Authority for the Ruhr (IAR), thus also ensuring French security by perpetuating French access to Ruhr coal.France Restored: Cold War Diplomacy and the Quest for Leadership in Europe, 1944‚Äì1954 H-Net Reviews June 2001 The activities and rights of the International Authority for the Ruhr were taken over by the European Coal and Steel Community.Information bulletin Frankfurt, Germany: Office of the US High Commissioner for Germany Office of Public Affairs, Public Relations Division, US Army, January 1952 \\"Plans for terminating international authority for the Ruhr\\", pp. 61‚Äì62 (main URL) See also * Dutch annexation of German territory after World War II * Industrial plans for Germany * Marshall Plan * Morgenthau Plan References and notes External links * French proposal regarding the detachment of German industrial regions September 8, 1945 * Ruhr Delegation of the United States of America, Council of Foreign Ministers American Embassy Moscow, March 24, 1947 * The Marshall Plan, 1948‚Äì1951 Albrecht Ritschl, Humboldt Universitaet ‚Äì Berlin * William I.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The Superintendent annually reports to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition.

Act 1 adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Bethel Park School District 2006-2007 through 2010-2011. *2006-07 - 4.6%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.1%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 5.3%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.0%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 3.5%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.7%, Base 1.4% For the 2011-12 school year the Bethel Park School Board applied for exceptions (pension costs/special ed costs) to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Bethel Park School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district‚Äôs index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. For 2009 and 2010, the School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Index limit. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. There are a large number of sports programs: 27 varsity, 17 junior varsity, 9 freshman and 14 middle school teams, as well as six club sports.

He was married to painter Alice Kindler and Persis Chase Myers. Kindler as cellist Kindler was born in Rotterdam as the child of Johan Karl Eduard Kindler (1838‚Äì1899) and Johannetta Filippina Maria Hanken. Kindler made his public debut aged 10 and took first prizes in cello and piano at the Rotterdam Conservatory in 1906. He studied under and Pablo Casals and in 1910 appeared as a soloist with the Berlin Philharmonic. He made a considerable reputation in Europe but when he went to the USA in 1914 to further his career, the outbreak of the First World War prevented his return. He immediately joined the Philadelphia Orchestra and was appointed first cello by Stokowski in 1916. That same year he gave the world premiere of Bloch's Schelomo at Carnegie Hall. He stayed in Philadelphia until 1920 but then resumed his solo career, both as a concerto soloist under such conductors as Mengelberg, Monteux and Reiner, and collaborating in chamber music recitals with Ravel and Rachmaninov. He gave first performances of works by Ravel and Schoenberg, and Ferruccio Busoni dedicated an arrangement of Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue for cello and piano to him. In 1929 he made extensive tours of the USA and Europe and also visited the Far East. But by now he had become an American citizen and taken up conducting and this led to a new career. Kindler as conductor Kindler made his conducting debut in 1927 with the Philadelphia Orchestra and the following year conducted the world premiere of Stravinsky's ballet Apollon musag√®te in Washington, commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. He then devoted himself entirely to conducting, a move which led him to found a brand new orchestra. This occurred in 1931 when he formed the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) in Washington, DC. Despite the Depression, the venture was a great success and resulted in many nationwide tours. Kindler was a champion of modern composers and introduced many new works to his audiences. He also achieved high praise for his moulding of the NSO and it was soon being ranked alongside the orchestras in Boston and Philadelphia. He stayed with the NSO for many years and in David Ewen's Dictators of the Baton (1948) the author wrote: \\"Kindler may not rise to those empyrean heights to which some other conductors may soar, but he is a self- respecting and respected musician who does justice to the great music he performs, and serves his art with humility.\\" That same year he guest-conducted in Europe and received plaudits from critics in Germany and Denmark who compared him with Weingartner and Toscanini. However, post-war conditions at the National Symphony Orchestra had deteriorated, as had Kindler's health, so he resigned on 30 November 1948 and gave his farewell concert the following March. Following a serious operation he died a few months later, on August 30, 1949 at Watch Hill, Rhode Island. Kindler on record Kindler made his first recordings as a cellist for Victor by the old acoustic method during the First World War. Following the introduction of electrical recording, he made a number of discs for Decca in 1929. His first recordings as a conductor were made for RCA Victor in 1940 and these included the first recording of William Schuman's American Festival Overture and the first American recording of Tchaikovsky's 3rd Symphony. Subsequent record sessions in 1941, 1942 and 1945 found Kindler recording such novelties and rarities as George Whitefield Chadwick's Noel, Mary Howe's Stars, Charles Weinberger's Czech Rhapsody, and Dai-Keong Lee's Prelude and Hula. These were recorded alongside more staple orchestral fare, such as Richard Strauss's Don Juan, Bed≈ôich Smetana's Vltava, and Johannes Brahms' 3rd Symphony which was praised for its \\"vitality and the glowing brilliance of the orchestra's execution.\\"The New Records, May 1941 Reputation According to the WPA Guide to Washington, originally published in 1942: \\"Potential symphony players had left Washington during the years of musical drought, and Kindler found it necessary to combine local talent with musicians imported from New York, Philadelphia and Boston.\\" However even in the worst year of the Great Depression Kindler managed to create his orchestra. According to violinist Milton Schwarz, \\"He was a famous cellist and the first chair of the cello section of the Philadelphia Orchestra. I had heard of him and heard him play. He was indeed very fine.\\" He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.Delta Omicron The Kindler Foundation Trust Fund was established in 1983 by the Kindler Foundation to offer concerts and to commission new chamber music in his memory.

Architecture The final section of Bancroft's 1970 building to be demolished, with new academy in background The previous school building was designed by John Bancroft of the Greater London Council's architecture department and was built in 1967‚Äì70. It was a noted example of brutalist architecture, constructed of concrete and glass without decorative claddings or ornament, and its appearance had been controversial since it opened. A contemporary critic likened it to a battleship, describing it as a \\"100-odd metre long, turreted, metallic grey thing lying in its own sunken rectangle\\". Over time, deterioration of the building's fabric and drawbacks of its glass construction led to complaints that the building was often excessively hot in the summer and very cold in winter.Westminster council votes to demolish Pimlico School, by Will Hurst, Building Design (BD Online), 14 Dec 2007 Council authorities also expressed concern that the building's seventeen exits and entrances made it difficult to secure the site, and that the site lacked disabled access.

The last remaining part of the old building was demolished in Summer 2010.Description of new building on school website Now the building is a 'C-shape' with different departments on each floor. Conversion to academy After many years of underperformance, culminating with Ofsted's decision to place the school in special measures and the retirement of former head teacher Phil Barnard in December 2006, Westminster council controversially voted in March 2008 to transform Pimlico into an academy.Westminster votes to turn Pimlico School into an Academy (17/03/2008) This decision was contrary to consistent expression from the school's stakeholders (teachers, students and parents) that they wanted the school to remain a community school. The Westminster NUT voted in favour of strike action to express their objections to Westminster council's strategy. Staff, students, parents and former school governors held the view that the school's underperformance was due to long- term neglect by Westminster council. During the process of Pimlico's change to an academy, the council argued that the borough's community education needs could be sufficiently served by preserving the existing community school status of Quintin Kynaston School. However, since then QK switched to a community foundation school, meaning that there were no longer any community schools in Westminster akin to the traditional inner-city comprehensive. The charity Future, set up by John and Caroline Nash, was chosen as the academy‚Äôs sponsor in 2008. In 2010 the school was rated ‚ÄòOutstanding‚Äô by Ofsted with particular praise for \\"the Principal's outstanding vision and leadership of his staff.\\" Primary school In 2013 Labour councillors called for an inquiry after the new Pimlico primary school where Nash was co-chairman of the governors appointed an unqualified teacher as headmistress ahead of its opening with 60 pupils in September.

It is one of Poe's comedy tales. Plot summary Illustration by Byam Shaw for a London edition dated 1909 The narrator, 22-year-old Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart, changes his last name to \\"Simpson\\" as a requirement to inherit a large sum from a distant cousin, Adolphus Simpson. At the opera he sees a beautiful woman in the audience and falls in love instantly. He describes her beauty at length, despite not being able to see her well; he requires spectacles but, in his vanity, \\"resolutely refused to employ them\\". His companion Talbot identifies the woman as Madame Eugenie Lalande, a wealthy widow, and promises to introduce the two. He courts her and proposes marriage; she makes him promise that, on their wedding night, he will wear his spectacles. When he puts on the spectacles, he sees that she is a toothless old woman. He expresses horror at her appearance, and even more so when he learns she is 82 years old. She begins a rant about a very foolish descendant of hers, one Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart. He realizes that she is his great- great-grandmother. Madame Lalande, who is also Mrs. Simpson, had come to America to meet her husband's heir. She was accompanied by a much younger relative, Madame Stephanie Lalande. Whenever the narrator spoke of \\"Madame Lalande\\", everyone assumed he meant the younger woman. When the elder Madame Lalande discovered that he had mistaken her for a young woman because of his eyesight, and that he had been openly courting her instead of being civil to a relative, she decided to play a trick on him with the help of Talbot and another confederate. Their wedding was a fake. He ends by marrying Madame Stephanie and vows to \\"never be met without SPECTACLES\\" ‚Äî having acquired a pair of his own at last. Publication history and response \\"The Spectacles\\" was first published in the Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper in the March 27, 1844 issue.Quinn, Arthur Hobson. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998: 400. Critics suggested that the piece was paid by the word, hence its relatively high length, especially for a work of humor. Upon its reprinting in the Broadway Journal in March 1845, Poe himself acknowledged he was \\"not aware of the great length of 'The Spectacles' until too late to remedy the evil\\". The editor of the Dollar Newspaper printed \\"The Spectacles\\" with the comment that \\"it is one of the best from [Poe's] chaste and able pen and second only to the popular prize production, 'The Gold-Bug.'\\"Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809‚Äì1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 455‚Äì456. Editor John Stephenson Du Solle reprinted the story in his daily newspaper The Spirit of the Times in Philadelphia, saying, \\"Poe's Story of 'The Spectacles' is alone worth double the price of the paper.\\"Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809‚Äì1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 456. It was first published overseas in the May 3, 1845 issue of London-based Lloyd's Entertaining Journal.Frank, Frederick S. and Anthony Magistrale. The Poe Encyclopedia. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1997: 200. Major themes Besides warning readers to obey their eye doctors, Poe seems to be addressing the concept of \\"love at first sight\\" ‚Äì in fact, the first line of the story points out that \\"it was the fashion to ridicule the idea\\". Yet, the story is presented to \\"add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position\\" that love at first sight does exist. The irony is that the narrator does not have a \\"first sight\\" of the woman he falls in love with, due to his lack of spectacles. Additionally, the story is based around vanity. The narrator changes his name, with \\"much repugnance\\", from Froissart to Simpson, \\"a rather usual and plebeian\\" name in order to collect inheritance. His original patronym, he says, elicited in him \\"a very pardonable pride\\". This same pride kept him from wearing spectacles. Madame Lalande admits that she was teaching him a lesson. The name of \\"Napoleon Bonoparte\\" makes obvious reference to the Corsican general Napoleon. The story also has very strong Oedipal tones. Scholar Carmen Trammell Skaggs noted that the story, though intended to be humorous, nevertheless showed Poe's awareness of the opera. He references the soprano singer Maria Malibran and the San Carlo, and he also describes vocal technique in a way that implies a close knowledge of the subject.Skaggs, Carmen Trammell. Overtones of Opera in American Literature from Whitman to Wharton. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010: 35. Skaggs also emphasizes Poe's role as a music critic for the New York Evening Mirror and, later, the Broadway Journal.Skaggs, Carmen Trammell.

By the end of the 19th century, he was considered the \\"unofficial poet laureate of Canada.\\" Although not as well known as the other Confederation poets today, Campbell was a \\"versatile, interesting writer\\" who was influenced by Robert Burns, the English Romantics, Edgar Allan Poe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Thomas Carlyle, and Alfred Tennyson. Inspired by these writers, Campbell expressed his own religious idealism in traditional forms and genres. Life William Wilfred Campbell was born around 1 June circa 1860 in Berlin, Ontario, now Kitchener. His father, Rev. Thomas Swainston Campbell, was an Anglican clergyman who had been assigned the task of setting up several frontier parishes in \\"Canada West\\", as Ontario was then called. Consequently, the family moved frequently. The Campbell family settled in Wiarton, Ontario in 1871, where Wilfred grew up, attending high school (which was later renamed the Owen Sound Collegiate and Vocational Institute) in nearby Owen Sound. Campbell would look back on his childhood with fondness: :As a boy, I always enjoyed the campfires we built in the woods or on the shingly beach of some lone lake shore, when the stars came out and peered down on the windy darkness and swallowed up the sparks and flames from the crackling logs and dry branches we heaped up while the local warmth and radiance added a contrast to the outside vastness of darkness and cold. Campbell taught in Wiarton before enrolling in the University of Toronto's University College in 1880, Wycliffe College in 1882, and at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1883. Campbell married Mary DeBelle (n√©e Dibble) in 1884. They had four children, Margery, Faith, Basil, and Dorothy. In 1885 Campbell was ordained to the Episcopal priesthood, and was soon appointed to a New England parish. In 1888 he returned to Canada and became rector of St. Stephen, New Brunswick. In 1891, after suffering a crisis of faith, Campbell resigned from the ministry and took a civil service position in Ottawa. He received a permanent position in the Department of Militia and Defence two years later. Living in Ottawa, Campbell became acquainted with Archibald Lampman‚Äîhis next door neighbor at one time‚Äîand through him with Duncan Campbell Scott. In February 1892, Campbell, Lampman, and Scott began writing a column of literary essays and criticism called \\"At the Mermaid Inn\\" for the Toronto Globe. As Lampman wrote to a friend: :Campbell is deplorably poor.... Partly in order to help his pockets a little Mr. Scott and I decided to see if we could get the Toronto Globe to give us space for a couple of columns of paragraphs & short articles, at whatever pay we could get for them. They agreed to it; and Campbell, Scott and I have been carrying on the thing for several weeks now. The column ran only until July 1893. Lampman and Scott found it difficult to \\"keep a rein on Campbell's frank expression of his heterodox opinions.\\" Readers of the Toronto Globe reacted negatively when Campbell presented the history of the cross as a mythic symbol. His apology for \\"overestimating their intellectual capacities\\" did little to resolve the controversy. In the 20th century, Campbell became a strong advocate of British imperialism, for example telling Toronto's Empire Club in 1904 that Canada's only choice lay \\"between two different imperialisms, that of Britain and that of the Imperial Commonwealth to the south.\\" It was the principles of Imperialist that guided his work in Poems of loyalty by British and Canadian authors (London, 1913) and for The Oxford Book of Canadian Verse (Toronto, 1913). As editor of The Oxford book of Canadian Verse, Campbell devoted more pages to his own poetry than to others'. But by choosing mostly from his longer work‚Äîincluding an excerpt from Mordred (one of his verse dramas)‚Äîhe did not choose his best work. In contrast, the poems he selected from his fellow Confederation Poets reflected some of their best work.John Coldwell Adams, \\"The Whirligig of Time,\\" Confederation Voices, Canadian Poetry, UWO.ca, Web, 28 March 2011 Campbell was transferred to the Dominion Archives in 1909. In 1915 he moved his family to an old stone farmhouse on the outskirts of Ottawa, which he named \\"Kilmorie\\". He died of pneumonia on New Year's morning, 1918. He was buried in Ottawa's Beechwood Cemetery. The William Wilfred Campbell Poetry Festival is held every June in his honour. The festival is traditionally held in Wiarton, Ontario. Writing Campbell's first chapbook, Poems!, \\"seems to have been printed at a newspaper office sometime around 1879 or 1880.\\" He placed poetry in the University of Toronto Varsity in 1881. As a theology student in Massachusetts, Campbell met Oliver Wendell Holmes, who recommended his poetry to Atlantic Monthly editor Thomas Bailey Aldrich. Aldrich published Campbell's \\"Canadian Folk Song\\" in the January 1885 issue, launching his career in the American magazines. In 1888 Snowflakes and Sunbeams was printed at Campbell's expense in St. Stephen, New Brunswick. The book \\"was favourably reviewed in Canada and the United States for its lovely nature lyrics, one of which, 'Indian summer' (it starts with 'Along the line of smoky hills / The crimson forest stands'), remains among the most beloved of Canadian poems.\\" The entire volume, including \\"Indian Summer,\\" was incorporated into Lake Lyrics, published the following year. \\"The poems in Lake lyrics and other poems (1889), with their intense rhythms, dramatic imagery, and ardent spirituality, express Campbell's devotion to nature as the revelation of God's presence; this book established his reputation as 'laureate of the lakes.'\\" Notable new poems in the book included \\"Vapor and Blue\\" and \\"The Winter Lakes\\". Campbell's poem \\"The Mother\\" was printed in Harper's New Monthly in April 1891; a traditional ballad, the poem tells of a dead mother who rises from the grave to claim her still-living baby. It \\"created a sensation in the literary press and was reprinted in newspapers such as the Week and the Globe in Toronto. In September 1891, the House of Commons (and, in 1892, the Senate) debated whether Campbell should receive a permanent civil service position in recognition of his literary abilities. The proposal was defeated, ostensibly for practical reasons, and the decision established a precedent for withholding patronage from artists. Nevertheless, in 1893 he was quietly given a permanent position in the Department of Militia and Defence, and he would remain a civil servant until his death.\\" Campbell's third book of poetry, The Dread Voyage Poems (1893), was darker than the earlier two. \\"In this volume, his poetry began to show the preoccupation with harmonizing religion, science, and social theory that had started while he was still a clergyman and would continue through his middle age.\\" The book contains some of Campbell's best-known poems, such as \\"How One Winter Came in the Lake Region\\" and the 'surprise ending' sonnet, \\"Morning on the Shore.\\" \\"In 1895 he published two versified tragedies, Mordred and Hildebrand, and these were included, with two others, Daulac and Morning, in a volume entitled Poetical tragedies (1908).\\"\\"Campbell, William Wilfred,\\" Encyclopedia of Canada (Toronto: University Associates, 1948), I, 352 Also in 1895, Campbell sparked a literary controversy by accusing Bliss Carman of plagiarism, an incident documented in Alexandra Hurst's 1994 book, The War Among the Poets (Canadian Poetry Press). Campbell published a new book of lyrics, Beyond the Hills of Dream, in 1899. \\"Included in the book was his jubilee ode 'Victoria,' written for the Queen's diamond jubilee in 1897. Eleven of its thirty-five other poems were reprinted from The Dread Voyage, thus perpetuating the dark tone of the earlier volume. Sombre also was \\"Bereavement of the Fields,\\" one of the better new poems, written in memory of Archibald Lampman, who died on 10 February 1899.\\" \\"The early years of the twentieth century saw a prolific outpouring of prose from Campbell. In addition to numerous pamphlets, he wrote five historical novels and three works of non-fiction. Only two of his novels ever appeared in book form: Ian of the Orcades (1906) ... and A Beautiful Rebel (1909). Another novel was never re-printed after its appearance in The Christian Guardian, and two novels still remain only in manuscript form. Two of his works of non-fiction were labours of love: a book about the Great Lakes (1910, reprinted and enlarged 1914), and an account of the Scottish settlements in Eastern Canada (1911). The title of the former is quite a mouthful: The Beauty, History, Romance, and Mystery of the Canadian Lake Region. Campbell intersperses these descriptive sketches, which appeared originally in The Westminster magazine, with selections of his lake lyrics to give the reader a very personal tour of the region. Subjective, also, is the bias of The Scotsman in Canada, which credits Scots with laying the foundation of nearly everything that is admirable in Canada.\\" In 1914, with war threatening, Campbell published a book of imperialistic verse, Sagas of a Vaster Britain. \\"Many of its seventy poems were recycled from previous collections, patriotic effusions like \\"England\\" (\\"Over the freedom and peace of the world/ Is the flag of England flung\\"), and some of his best work like \\"How One Winter Came to the Lake Region\\". The new poems, like \\"Life's Ocean\\" and \\"The Dream Divine,\\" have the old weaknesses of displeasing sound (\\"large-mooned waters\\") and awkward structure (\\"And of all love's far, dim dawnings of hope unborn/ God's latest are best\\").\\" \\"Sagas ... was his last book, but each New Year's from 1915 to 1918 he distributed pamphlets of poems relating to World War I.\\" When Campbell died in 1918, his \\"popularity died with him. Technically, his work is usually conservative, and his ideas have become unfashionable. His poetry has been compared with the more polished works\\" of the four major Confederation poets. \\"In fact,\\" though, as the DCB sums up his career, \\"Campbell worked hard to achieve naturalness, sincerity, and simplicity of expression, rather than polish; he tried to convey universal truths in order to inspire his readers to strive toward their noblest ideals. Within this framework, the artistic merit of many of his poems becomes evident.\\" Campbell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1894. He was declared a Person of National Historic Significance in 1938. Bibliography =Poetry= *Poems! (1879-1880?)  * *The poems of Wilfred Campbell.

The most commonly accepted theory claims that the word Gara originates from a Slavic word meaning hill. (The original village was situated on a small hill, at a distance of 4 kilometers from its current location.) According to Turkish tax listings, the village had 25 houses under Ottoman rule. The original village was destroyed. After the Kingdom of Hungary regained its lost territories, Gara was rebuilt. In 1731, the village's population reached 277. In 1734, Germans settled the place. The first school there was opened in 1755 (by J√°nos Bary). In 1895, Gara was connected to the national railroad system. This line was closed in 1971 as traffic declined (the Treaty of Trianon had made this line unnecessary, and after fifty years, the train company decided to end service to Gara).

Organization Denver City and County Building Denver is a consolidated city-county with an elected mayor, thirteen-member city council, auditor, and clerk and recorder. Denver city elections are on a non-partisan basis: that is, there are no official party nominees, though officials may belong to a political party. All citywide elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. =Mayor= Denver has a strong mayor and a weak city council government.

Pazen, who was appointed in 2018. The Police Department began in December 1859, with the election of the first city marshal. The force gained its first African-American police officer in 1880, and its first female police \\"matron\\" in 1888. Fire Department The city of Denver is protected 24/7, 365 by the paid, full-time firefighters of the city of Denver Fire Department (DFD). The Denver Fire Department currently is organized into 6 Divisions of Operations, each under the Command of a Division Chief: Operations Division; Fire Prevention and Investigation Division; Technical Services Division; Administrative Division; Safety and Training Division; Airport Division. The DFD currently operates out of 34 Fire Stations (including 4 Airport Stations) in 8 Districts, each under the command of an Assistant Chief, located throughout the city.

The Board in turn designates a manager who is in charge of day-to-day operations. =Assessor= The County Assessor is responsible for valuing all property in the county except for exempt property and state assessed properties. Taxpayers may appeal the assigned value to the Assessor and the County Board of Equalization (valuation appeal and abatement). =Board of Equalization= The Denver Board of Equalization performs the functions of equalization, reduction, abatement, and rebate of general taxes. Of the functions, abatement is usually the responsibility of the Board of County Commissioners. It is composed of the Manager of General Services, Manager of Public Works, Clerk and Recorder, Chief Financial Officer, and President of the City Council. The Colorado Board of Assessment Appeals (BAA) hears appeals filed by real and personal property owners regarding the valuation placed on their property. Law Title page of the Denver Revised Municipal Code (DRMC) Pursuant to the Constitution and law of Colorado, Denver is governed by the Charter of Denver. Pursuant to its charter, the Council has promulgated numerous local ordinances which have been codified in the Denver Revised Municipal Code (DRMC). The City and County of Denver levies an Occupational Privilege Tax (OPT or Head Tax) on employers and employees. *If any employee performs work in the city limits and is paid over $500 for that work in a single month, the employee and employer are both liable for the OPT regardless of where the main business office is located or headquartered. *The employer is liable for $4 per employee per month and the employee is liable for $5.75 per month. *It is the employer's responsibility to withhold, remit, and file the OPT returns. If an employer does not comply, the employer can be held liable for both portions of the OPT as well as penalties and interest. Politics While Denver elections are non-partisan, Democrats have long held a virtual monopoly on Denver politics with all citywide elected officials having Democratic Party affiliation. The office of Denver's Mayor has been occupied by a Democrat since the municipal general election of 1963. In recent years, Denver increased its help for people experiencing homelessness, largely through the initiative of mayors John Hickenlooper and Wellington Webb. Many residents of the city streets have suffered during Denver winters. Although mild and dry much of the time, Denver's winters can have brief periods of cold temperatures and snow. The city created a ten-year plan to end homelessness, a task force and commission to end homelessness, and an expansion of human and civil services through the Denver area. However, current Mayor Michael Hancock has opposed meaningful solutions to Denver's increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness such as a ballot initiative to end the city of Denver's ban on urban campsites. The capitol building, Colorado's political center, located in Denver. Former Denver mayor John Hickenlooper was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino. In federal elections, Denverites also tend to vote for Democratic candidates. Denver is represented at the federal level by congresswoman Diana DeGette, a Democrat representing Colorado's 1st congressional district, which includes all of Denver and parts of Arapahoe County. History Denver was founded in 1858 and incorporated in 1861. The city was chosen as the permanent state capital of Colorado by a special election in 1881. The historic Denver City and County Building was built to house city and county administration before 1920. In hosting the 1908 Democratic National Convention, Denver gained a spotlight in what was at the time an east coast-dominated national politics. Industrialists now moving west with innovation and big business were witness to Denver's political value, and more importantly, venue. Conquering the west is considered to be no easy challenge politically, and still an important asset. In the later part of the 20th century, winning the west was seen as crucial to a win abroad, making Denver the \\"center stage\\" in the political arena. During the 1960s and 1970s, Denver was one of the epicenters of the Chicano Movement. The boxer-turned- activist Rodolfo \\"Corky\\" Gonzales formed an organization called the Crusade for Justice, which battled police brutality, fought for bilingual education, and, most notably, hosted the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in March 1969. Denver hosted the 2008 Democratic National Convention, which coincided with the centennial of the city's 1908 hosting of the convention. The 2008 Libertarian National Convention was also hosted in Denver, which is also the site of the original Libertarian Party Convention, which was held in 1972.Libertarian National Convention#1972 It also hosted the G7 summit between June 20 and June 22 in 1997. On October 31, 2011 it was announced that The University of Denver in Denver was selected as the host of the first of three 2012 presidential debates to be held on October 3, 2012. Other governments The Denver Public Schools (DPS) district is the public school system in Denver. DPS is governed by the elected seven-member Denver Board of Education, with five elected by voters within five districts and two elected at-large. The Board in turn appoints the Superintendent. The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is the regional authority operating public transit services in eight counties that have delegated transit public services to the multi-county district, of a total of the twelve counties in the Denver- Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area. RTD is governed by a 15-member Board of Directors, elected to four-year terms within specific constituency districts. The Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DHHA), which manages the Denver Health Medical Center and other hospitals and services in the region, is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors who are appointed for five years by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council.AN ACT Concerning the creation of the Denver health and hospital authority .

Description Canvas and leather pack produced by Duluth Pack. Their #3 has no \\"set out\\" and so is envelope-shaped. A Duluth pack is a specialized type of backpack made of heavy canvas, leather, and/or cordura nylon. The packs are a traditional portage pack which are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe. The simplest and most traditional Duluth pack consists of a single large envelope which is closed by straps and roller buckles. The pack is carried by two shoulder straps, and sometimes a tumpline worn over the top of the head. Their key attributes make them well adapted to wilderness canoe camping where travel is largely by water (where the packs and gear do not need to be carried) punctuated by portages where the packs and gear need to be carried over land: *They are generally larger than other packs, accommodating a larger quantity of gear. Canoe camping typically involves carrying more and heavier gear than, for example, backpacking. *They must be built strong, carrying heavy loads even when exposure to the elements can weaken certain pack materials such as by saturation of leather. *Their shape accommodates large volumes while remaining compact, and their design has few protuberances. This allows better fitting into canoes, less snagging during loading and unloading, less \\"catching\\" of the wind when traveling, and packing lower in canoes to lower the center of gravity to enhance canoe stability. *They are not tall above the wearer's shoulders (such as backpacking packs typically are) allowing the wearer to also carry a canoe. *Some have a tumpline which assists weight distribution with heavy loads. Conversely, they lack many features and attributes of long distance backpacking type backpacks, and so are generally not used for such. History The Duluth pack has its roots in a French-Canadian named Camille Poirier, who made his way west to Duluth, Minnesota. Arriving in 1870 with his \\"little stock of leather and tools,\\" he began a small shoe store and quickly made a go of it in this booming frontier town on the shores of Lake Superior. Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront in Duluth, Camille began building a new style canoe pack with a tumpline, sternum strap, and umbrella holder. The patented the \\"C. Poirier Pack Sack\\" strap design in 1882. In 1911, Poirier sold his business to Duluth Tent & Awning Company, which later became the company Duluth Pack.

A total of 1,200 Mark 15 bombs were produced from 1955 to 1957. There were three production variants: Mod 1, Mod 2, and Mod 3. The design was in service from 1955 to 1965. Transitional design The Mark 15 is widely described as a transitional design between fission and thermonuclear weapons. The Mark 15 was a staged weapon (see Teller-Ulam design) that used radiation implosion from a fission nuclear primary (RACER IV) to implode a secondary stage. Unlike most modern thermonuclear bombs, most of the Mark 15's destructive energy came from fission reactions. The secondary was made primarily of highly enriched uranium (HEU) around a thermonuclear core. The implosion created fusion reactions whose neutrons increased the yield of the HEU fission reactions, but which would have generated a very significant fission yield by itself. Some later bombs used depleted uranium fusion stage tampers, and neutrons from the fusion would fission some of the tamper, but half or more of the energy was released from the fusion reaction. The HEU secondary tamper concept may have been used in the most modern nuclear weapons, where compact size and weight were highly valued, including the W88 and W87 Mod 1 weapons. Specifications All three models were generally physically similar; weight of around 7,600 lb/3,450 kg, diameter of 34.4 to 35 inches, length of 136 to 140 inches.

It was canceled in early 1957. Before cancellation, it had been intended for use on the SM-62 Snark missile. Instead, the Snark ended up using the W39 (see below). Derivatives The W39 nuclear warhead and B39 nuclear bomb used a common nuclear physics package which was derived from the Mark 15. The experimental W39 devices were initially tested as the TX-15-X3 (which is identical to the W39 Mod 0 design). Dropped and lost On February 5, 1958, during a training mission flown by a B-47, a Mk 15 nuclear bomb was lost off the coast of Tybee Island, Georgia near Savannah.

Flooding on Canal Street, New Orleans caused by the crevasse, painted in 1849 by Elizabeth Lamoisse In May 1849 the Mississippi reached the highest water level in this area observed in twenty-one years. Some seventeen miles (27 km) up river from the city of New Orleans in Jefferson Parish lay a plantation belonging to Pierre Sauv√©, in what is now River Ridge, Louisiana. There, on the afternoon of May 3, the levee gave way. At once it was seen to be impossible to stem the raging waters. People in New Orleans hoped that the flood would find its way into Lake Pontchartrain by some channel or the other, before reaching the city. But the swamp rapidly filled; the water approached the outskirts of the town; and it was quickly too late to throw up any adequate defenses. By May 15 the water was at Rampart Street. The First Municipality went to work on a small levee which lay along the lower bank of the Carondelet Canal, and raised it sufficiently to shut out the flood from that part of the city. Some of the water was drained via the canal into Bayou St. John and thence into Lake Pontchartrain. This protected much of the city below the Canal. This was a significant success, which kept the flooding out of the Faubourg St. John, Marigny, and other downriver portions of the city. By providing an outlet for the waters, the action prevented deeper and more widespread flooding above the Canal. However, most of what is now Uptown New Orleans and the New Orleans Central Business District were badly flooded. The water spread from the low- lying \\"back of town\\" into the higher ground closer to the River, and attained its highest point on May 30. In the CBD, floodwater reached Bacchus (Baronne) Street from the upper limits of Lafayette to Canal. Where the ground was low, floodwaters extended into Carondelet. Further Uptown, between Louisiana and Napoleon avenues, the flooding stopped just short of Magazine Street. In Carrollton, above Canal Avenue (Carrollton Avenue), the waters reached to Forth Street (Oak), and below to Burthe. Waring & Cable (Social Statistics of Cities, Reports on New Orleans) reported, \\"About 220 inhabited squares were flooded, more than 2,000 tenements were surrounded by water, and a population of near 12,000 souls either driven from their homes or living an aquatic life of much privation and suffering.\\" This figure may be only for the city of New Orleans as then constituted, with its upper limit at Felicity Street. Much of what later became known as Uptown New Orleans was then the separate towns of Lafayette, Bouligny, Jefferson, and Carrollton. For weeks, the efforts to close the crevasse had proven unavailing. Then two engineers, George T. Dunbar and Surgi, undertook the task, and with carte blanche as to methods and materials, succeeded after seventeen days in stanching the flood on June 20, 1849. The waters did not disappear until nearly a month later. By June 22, the principal streets were clear again. Heavy rains washed away the mud deposited by the flood, and the city began to resume its normal aspect. Public property had suffered extensive damage, particularly in the Second Municipality (what is now the CBD and Lower Garden District). The city and homeowners had to replace pavements, gutters and gutter-bridges. In 1850 the Second Municipality found it necessary to levy a special tax of $400,000 to offset \\"actual expenditures on streets, wharves and crevasses.\\" Somewhat tardily, the municipal council erected a levee on Felicity Street, from the point where the Claiborne Canal intersected the New Basin Canal, to the corner of Apollo (Carondelet) Street. While New Orleans has suffered numerous floods large and small in its history, the flood of 1849 was of a more disastrous scale than any save the flooding after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (see Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans). Katrina flooded a larger total urban area, but much of what would later become the city of New Orleans and its suburbs in Jefferson Parish was still swampland in May 1849. The water level of the Mississippi River which flooded the city in 1849 was higher than that of Lake Pontchartrain, which flowed into the city after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This is particularly evident in areas of Uptown. Higher water levels were recorded in certain places in 1849 than when they were flooded again in 2005. Also, the flooding of 1849 extended into a significant part of Uptown that remained dry during the flooding after Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans has not experienced flooding directly from the Mississippi River since Sauv√©'s Crevasse, although it came dangerously close during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.

Her FBI handlers, including her new contact Robyn Sanseverino, are pressing for information. They tell her that Christopher is associating with dangerous criminals, and she can help him; they cause her to doubt what she believes, that Richie and Pussy disappeared because they entered witness protection. She gives away a little information about Patsy. At home, she relieves stress with an injection of Chris' heroin. Janice is insinuating herself into Bobby's family life. She freezes out Mikey Palmice's widow JoJo. She serves the family Carmela's delicious lasagna, claiming it as her own. She urges Bobby to get over his grief‚Äîhe might lose Junior's support. Bobby pulls himself together and completes a neglected task for Junior: meeting with a union shop steward to intimidate him into changing his vote in an upcoming election. Tony and Carmela are still bitterly divided about money and investment. He refuses to sign the life insurance trust she proposes, having been advised it is too much in her favor. She receives a stock tip; when he comes up with the money, it is too late. Ralphie's racehorse, \\"Pie-O-My,\\" wins and he happily shares the winnings with Tony. Next time Tony, who has suggested the race tactics, requires an even bigger share, to Ralphie's chagrin. Tony begins to speak of \\"our\\" horse; Ralphie is less fond and resents the expense. Veterinarian's fees pile up, and one night when Pie-O-My is very sick the vet refuses further treatment unless he is paid. Ralphie refuses to act and passes along Tony's number; Tony rushes to the stables and pays. Then he goes into the stall and sits with the animal, gently stroking her neck, telling her that everything will be all right.

His father transferred all his ironworks in the Midlands to him in 1668 and 1669 for ¬£60,000. He also settled an estate at Prestwood near Stourbridge on him on his marriage, to which Philip added the manor of Kinver. Ironworks Philip ran the ironworks but found that they were not as profitable as they had been, and began from 1674 to sell them off. One group was bought by Sir Clement Clerke. He disposed of the last of them to two of his managers John Wheeler and Richard Avenant, and they also took over what had been Sir Clement Clerke's ironworks when some of those reverted to Philip Foley. Wheeler and Avenant were more successful in running a rather reduced business and leased blast furnaces in the Forest of Dean from Philip's brother Paul. In 1692, the two joined the managers in the business. Philip remained a partner for the rest of his life, but his family sold out of it shortly after his death. This business produced high quality pig iron which was sent up the River Severn for sale through a warehouse at Bewdley, as well as supplying the firm's own forges such as Wilden Forge on the River Stour. In 1705, John Wheeler retired from managing the business in favour of William Rea, and the firm gave up its remaining ironworks in the Stour valley. Another iron making business became available with the death of Philip's uncle Henry Glover in 1689. This was handed over to John Wheeler, but in 1695, he and Philip decided that Philip had actually been a partner in it since 1689. This probably could not be openly declared earlier as Philip was one of Glover's executors. This had iron works consisting of Mearheath Furnace (a little distance from the present Meir Heath), and Consall and Oakamoor Forges. Further works were added, including a group in the east Midlands consisting of Staveley Furnace and Forge and Carburton Forge, though that group were only used from 1695 to 1698 when they were handed over to Yorkshire ironmasters. They also made a trade investment in ironworks in Cheshire, in connection with securing a supply of pig iron from there. The Staffordshire and Cheshire businesses were amalgamated in 1708, but Philip probably sold out shortly after 1710. Politics Philip was also involved in politics as a Member of Parliament and was first elected for Bewdley in 1679. He was subsequently elected for Stafford in 1689 and 1695 and Droitwich in 1690 and 1701. There was a time when five of the family were in the House of Commons together, the others being his brothers Thomas and Paul Foley, and his nephews (their sons) both called Thomas, one of whom later became Lord Foley. They belonged to the Country Whigs, like their brother in law Robert Harley. Religion Like most of his family, he was a Presbyterian, though evidently conforming to the Church of England at least occasionally. He employed a series of domestic chaplains, who established Presbyterian congregations in several nearby towns. Family Philip married Penelope, daughter of William Paget, 5th Baron Paget. Their eldest son was Paul Foley of Prestwood (died 27 November 1739). He married Elizabeth Turton, and died leaving two sons (William, born 17 May 1710, and Philip, born 4 June 1711) and three daughters, including Elizabeth (born 3 November 1707) who married John Hodgetts of Shut End in Kingswinford. Their only child Eliza Maria Foley Hodgetts married her distant cousin Hon Edward Foley. The Prestwood estate followed this descent, being settled on her marriage to descend to her second son John Hodgetts Hodgetts-Foley.

Salmon, 164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928), is a widely cited case in which the New York Court of Appeals held that partners in a business owe fiduciary duties to one another where a business opportunity arises during the course of the partnership. The court holds that the fiduciary duty of communication was breached where a partner in a joint venture failed to inform his co-partner of a profitable opportunity that was offered by a third-party who was ignorant of the partnership. Furthermore, the duty of loyalty was breached where the partner appropriated to himself a benefit arising from his status as a partner without allowing his co-partner an opportunity to compete. This holding relates to the doctrine of corporate opportunity. Facts Meinhard claimed that his former business partner, Salmon, had violated a fiduciary duty by taking an opportunity to renew a lease in his own name without sharing the benefits. In 1902, Salmon bought a 20-year lease for the Hotel Bristol, owned by Elbridge Thomas Gerry, at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street in New York.Miller, Geoffry P. Meinhard v Salmon New York University Law and Economics Working Papers, Year 2007, Paper 105. p. 4 Salmon wished to convert the hotel into shops and offices. To raise money, he entered a joint venture with Meinhard. They put the terms of their relationship in writing. Meinhard provided the investment capital while Salmon managed the business. The first five years, Meinhard would receive 40% of the profits and 50% every year after until the twentieth year. Meinhard was given the sole power to assign the lease during the term of the venture. The venture was created to terminate at the end of the lease. After 20 years, as the lease was expiring and the joint venture coming to an end, the owner of the reversion of the lease, Gerry, approached Salmon to negotiate a substantial redevelopment of the property. Gerry was ignorant of the partnership. The terms of the new lease contemplated destruction of the then-existing buildings after a period of seven years followed by reconstruction. Salmon resigned the lease in his individual capacity without telling Meinhard. When Meinhard found out, he sued. Meinhard argued the new opportunity belonged to the joint venture and sued to have the lease transferred to a constructive trust. Salmon argued any interest in the new lease could not belong to the joint venture since both parties expected the venture to terminate when the first lease expired. A referee agreed the opportunity belonged to the joint venture, and awarded Meinhard a 25% interest (based on Meinhard's half interest in half the property). The Appellate Division ratcheted it up to 50%. Salmon appealed from that decision. Judgment While it lowered the plaintiff's award to 49%, the court affirmed the decision. It held that Salmon, as the managing partner, owed Meinhard, as the investing partner, a fiduciary duty, and that this included a duty to inform Meinhard of the new leasing opportunity. Joint venturers owe each other the highest duty of loyalty and Salmon, as managing partner has assumed a responsibility by which Meinhard must rely on him to manage the partnership. As Chief Judge Benjamin Cardozo said, The court further held that Salmon was an agent for the joint venture. The court determined the new business opportunity ‚Äî which was made available to Salmon because during the course of his agency, or management of the venture ‚Äî Salmon was obligated to act as a fiduciary of the venture in the transaction. Specifically, the court held that he was obligated by the fiduciary duty of communication to notify the venture of profits obtained during the course of his agency. The court held that he was obligated by the duty of loyalty to share the profits with the venture. Alternatively, the court holds that he was required to inform Meinhard of the opportunity and allow him an opportunity to compete for the lease. This decision extended the duties of partnership far beyond duties under a contract. Contractual duties among merchants do not typically extend beyond the duty of good-faith. However, the court held that a joint venture created a fiduciary relationship in which each member is bound to a higher standard. It determined that in such a relationship, loyalty must be undivided and unselfish, and that a breach of fiduciary duty can occur by something less than fraud or intentional bad-faith. The court noted that Salmon did not maliciously appropriate to himself the benefits of the partnership. The court observed that, by contract, Salmon was simply exercising his sole ability to execute a lease and may have assumed that he owed no further duty. Nonetheless, the court ruled in favor of Meinhard. =Andrews' dissent= A three-judge dissent, written by Judge Andrews, contended that any duty following from the partnership ended at the end of the twenty-year period; because the partnership was created to manage the building for the twenty-year term, the dissent felt that deals involving events to occur after the expiration of that term were of no matter to the partnership. Significance The case is considered a landmark case of partnership law, and has since come to be reproduced or at least discussed in virtually every American casebook on the subject. Aftermath Initially, Salmon was unhappy about the decision. But when the Great Depression began shortly after the decision, Salmon came to view his loss as a surprise victory. Since Meinhard was now a half owner in the joint enterprise, he was not only entitled to half of the profits but also required to pay half of the losses. During much of the Great Depression, this property lost money. Salmon's finances were thus assisted by Meinhard's financial contributions.http://www.westacademic.com/Professors/ProductDetails.aspx?NSIID=1915 See also *US trusts law *United States corporate law *Beatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co (1919) 225 NY 380 *English trusts law Notes External links 1928 in United States case law New York (state) state case law United States corporate case law 1928 in New York (state) United States trusts case law Fifth Avenue ","title":"Meinhard v.

The term also refers to a law that prohibits the publication of the identity of an alleged rape victim. Australia In Australia, all states and mainland territories have rape shield laws that limit the admission of evidence in criminal proceedings where someone is charged with a sexual offence. The principal aims of these laws are to: *prohibit the admission of evidence of a complainant‚Äôs sexual reputation; *prevent the use of sexual history evidence to establish the complainant as a ‚Äòtype‚Äô of person who is more likely to consent to sexual activity; and *exclude the use of a complainant‚Äôs sexual history as an indicator of the complainant‚Äôs truthfulness.Australian Government: ALRC: 20. Matters Outside the Uniform Evidence Acts - Rape shield laws Canada In Canadian criminal proceedings in respect of a sexual assault, section 276(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada restricts the admissibility of evidence that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity, whether with the accused or with any other person. Such evidence \\"is not admissible to support an inference that, by reason of the sexual nature of that activity, the complainant (a) is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge; or (b) is less worthy of belief.\\" The law sets down (in sections 276(2) and 276(3)) strict rules and procedures for determining admissibility of such evidence. In 1992, legislation amended the Criminal Code to re-establish this rape shield provision with strict guidelines for when and how previous sexual conduct could be used by a defendant at trial. The reform was enacted by Parliament after the 1991 ruling, R. v. Seaboyer had struck down the previously existing rape shield law (enacted in 1982) as unconstitutional. Bill C-49 amended the Criminal Code provisions that govern the admissibility of evidence of sexual activity; refined the definition of consent to a sexual act; and restricted the defence that an accused had an honest but mistaken belief that the accuser had consented. The 1995 Supreme Court judgment in the case of British Columbia Bishop Hubert O'Connor (R. v. O'Connor) led to Bill C-46, which limited the production of a complainant's personal counselling records to the defence in sexual offence cases. Bill C-46 was tested in R. v. Mills, and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1999. In the 2000 decision of R. v. Darrach, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the law in a case involving former Ottawa resident Andrew Scott Darrach, who was convicted of sexually assaulting his ex- girlfriend. Darrach was sentenced in 1994 to nine months in jail for the assault. By a 9‚Äì0 decision, the court found that all the rape shield provisions in the Criminal Code are constitutional. The ruling said forcing the accuser to give evidence would invade her privacy and would \\"discourage the reporting of crimes of sexual violence.\\" In his appeal, Darrach had argued that he had been denied a fair trial because he was unable to raise the fact that he mistakenly thought the incident was consensual. Additionally, Darrach had argued that the law unfairly required him to testify at his own trial because the trial judge had held an evidentiary hearing with the jury absent to determine whether an affidavit from Darrach describing his former relationship with the complainant was admissible. Darrach had refused to testify or be cross-examined on the affidavit and the trial judge had therefore ruled this evidence inadmissible.Supreme Court upholds rape-shield law Erin Anderssen The Globe and Mail, Ottawa October 13, 2000.) The appeal upheld the trial judge's decision. New Zealand Sections 44 and 44A of the Evidence Act 2006 sets out rules for propensity evidence about a complainant's sexual experience and reputation in sexual cases. Prior to the 2006 Act, section 23A of the Evidence Act 1908, as amended by the Evidence Amendment Act 1977, set out these rules. Section 44 protects complainants in prosecutions for sexual offences from certain questions and evidence about their sexual experience and reputation. The starting point is to exclude evidence or questions that relate to the complainant's reputation in sexual matters or to the complainant's sexual experience with a person other than the defendant. However, the Judge may permit any evidence or a question about that experience if satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude it because of its direct relevance to the facts in issue or to the question of the appropriate sentence (the heightened relevance test). Section 44A provides no evidence of a complainant's sexual experience may be offered in a criminal proceeding unless the other parties have been given notice of the proposed statement, or if every other party has waived the notice requirements, or if the Judge dispenses with those requirements. The section also sets out the notice requirements for evidence proposed to be offered in criminal proceedings. Complainants are equally bound by the law, preventing them introducing evidence about their own sexual experience contrary to sections 44 and 44A.For example: Evidence of a complainant's sexual experience with the defendant is not subject to the heightened relevance test, although it is still subject to the general relevance test in sections 7 and 8 of the Evidence Act. This has proved to be a contentious issue, with the debate mainly centres on the perceived direct relevance of such evidence. Those in support of extending the rule to cover sexual experience with the defendant argue that evidence of previous sexual experience between the complainant and defendant should not lead to an implication that the complainant is more likely to agree to the sexual activity on another occasion. Those opposed argue that the existence of a prior sexual relationship between the complainant and the defendant will often be, or inevitably is, directly relevant. In 2017, Law Commission began its second statutory review of the Evidence Act. In its March 2018 issues paper, it asked several questions about the operation of section 44, especially in light of two court cases: * B (SC12/2013) v R [2013] NZSC 151, [2014] 1 NZLR 261 ‚Äì What admissibility rule should apply to sexual disposition evidence? * Best v R [2016] NZSC 122, [2017] 1 NZLR 186 ‚Äì Should false and/or allegedly false complaints be treated as evidence of veracity, sexual experience, or as both? United States In the late 1970s and early 1980s, almost all jurisdictions in the United States adopted some form of rape shield statute. The laws in each state differ in the scope of sexual behaviour shielded and time limits of the shield. Many states do not permit any evidence relating to the past sexual behaviour of the victim. This encompasses evidence of specific instances of the victim's prior or subsequent sexual conduct including opinion evidence or reputation evidence.Rape Shield Statutes March 2011‚Äîaccessed at National District Attorneys Association Retrieved June 19, 2011. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 created a federal rape shield law.Factsheet: The Violence Against Women Act from The White House. The military has incorporated the rape shield law into Military Rules of Evidence, Rule 412.Military Rules of Evidence, Rule 412 The military's rape shield law also applies to Article 32, pre-trial proceedings.Manual for Courts-Martial United States (2012), 405(i). A recent news article, however, has accused defense attorneys of violating rape shield protections during a pre-trial proceeding. In 1999, in the case of People v. Jovanovic, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that a lower court had improperly ruled as inadmissible e-mails in which the plaintiff/witness in a rape case expressed her consent to, and later approval of, the encounter. The lower court ruled these e-mails inadmissible on the basis of rape shield laws; however, the Court of Appeals ruled that the previous court had misapplied those laws. =Identification of alleged rape victims by media outlets= As a matter of courtesy, most newspapers and broadcast media in the United States do not disclose the name of an alleged rape victim during the trial, and if the alleged rapist is convicted, most will continue to not identify the victim. If the case is dropped or the alleged rapist is acquitted, most media will no longer shield the name of the alleged victim. This practice was probably related to laws in some states which made it a crime to publicly reveal the name of the victim in a rape case. When such laws were challenged in court, they were routinely struck down as unconstitutional.New Directions from the Field: Victims Rights and Services for the 21st Century (Chapter 13), accessed October 16, 2012. * In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a Georgia statute that imposed civil liability on media for publishing a rape victim's name. Cox's television station in Atlanta, WSB-TV, had obtained the victim's name from public court records‚Äîa factor the Supreme Court held to be important, noting that \\"the First and Fourteenth Amendments command nothing less than that the States may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection.\\" * In Florida Star v. B. J. F., , the U.S. Supreme Court found a Florida statute which provided penalties for media outlets that publicized the name of an alleged rape victim unconstitutional. * In State of Florida v. Globe Communications Corp., 648 So.2d 110 (Fla. 1994), the Florida Supreme Court held that a Florida criminal statute that prohibited the media from identifying the names of sexual assault victims violated the First Amendment. In that case, Globe Communications Corp. twice published the name and identifying information of a sexual assault victim, violating the Florida statute. The paper had lawfully learned the victim's name through investigation. The Florida Supreme Court relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Florida Star v. B.J.F., finding that the Florida statute barring any media publication of a rape victim's name was unconstitutional because it was \\"overbroad\\"; that is, it punished the media even if, for example, the name of the victim was already known in the community. It also found that the statute was \\"underinclusive\\" in that it punished only media publication and not acts by a private person.

Frieda had herself baptized as Roman Catholic in order to further her budding career as an opera singer. She appeared as a Valkyrie in Wagner's most famous opera at the Stadtsopera in Vienna in 1914. His father was Karl Groeger (1883,Vienna, Austria 1883.d. 1967, Chicago, Il.U.S.A.). Karl Groeger Sr. was the son of a Jewish mother, Anna, and a Gentile father.

Two years later, in May 1940, the German Wehrmacht marched into the Netherlands. He had to join the German Army. After some months the army discharged him because he was discovered to be of Jewish descent. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Karl (Bubie as he was known to friends and Munkie as he was known to his parents), was the product of a full Jewish mother (who converted into the Catholic faith in 1911) and of a half-Jewish father.

Some civil servants were willing to falsify records in the civil registry so that they would match up with forged identification cards.

The mission was particularly difficult because security at civil registries had been tightened up after a similar assault on an office in Wageningen in late 1942. Security guards were now posted at strategic locations in the Amsterdam civil registry office.

During the second century BC Salcah was a flourishing Nabataean city, where the gods Dushara and Allat were worshiped. Afterwards it was incorporated into the Roman province of Arabia, it was one of the important cities in Hauran during Roman and later Byzantine epochs, Salkhad is indicated in the Madaba mosaic map of the sixth century AD. Due to the strategic position of the city overlooking Hauran plains to the west, the Ayyubid dynasty built a fortress in Salkhad between 1214‚Äì1247 to counter a possible attack of the Crusades into inner Hauran. It has also been said that Al-Afdal was exiled here by his uncle and brother. The importance of the city decreased after the Crusades, and it was occasionally overrun by Bedouins seeking pasture in the summer for their flocks. In 1596, Salkhad appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as Salhad (Sarhad) and was part of the nahiya of Bani Malik as-Sadir in the Hauran Sanjak. It had a Muslim population consisting of 55 households and 25 bachelors, and a Christian population of 50 households and 20 bachelors.

Rider Haggard's 1889 novel Cleopatra, the 1890 play Cleopatre by √âmile Moreau and Victorien Sardou, and the play Antony and Cleopatra by William Shakespeare. The film starred Theda Bara in the title role, Fritz Leiber, Sr. as Julius Caesar, and Thurston Hall as Mark Antony. The film is now considered lost, with only fragments surviving. Plot Because the film has been lost, the following summary is reconstructed from a description in a contemporary film magazine. Cleopatra (Bara), the Siren of Egypt, by a clever ruse reaches Caesar (Leiber) and he falls victim to her charms. They plan to rule the world together, but then Caesar falls. Cleopatra's life is desired by the church, as the wanton woman's rule has become intolerable. Pharon (Roscoe), a high priest, is given a sacred dagger to take her life. He gives her his love instead and, when she is in need of some money, leads her to the tomb of his ancestors, where she tears the treasure from the breast of the mummy. With this wealth she goes to Rome to meet Antony (Hall). He leaves the affairs of state and travels to Alexandria with her, where they revel. Antony is recalled to Rome and married to Octavia (Blinn), but his soul cries out for Cleopatra. He sends her a message to arm her ships and meet him at Actium, where they battle the opposing forces. They are overpowered, and flee to Alexandria. There they are captured by Octavius (De Vries), and Antony dies in Cleopatra's arms. Before Cleopatra is to be dragged behind the wheels of Octavius' chariot, Pharon the priest, who has never ceased to love her, brings her the serpent that she joyously brings to her breast, dying royally with her crown on her head and scepter in her hand as becomes Egypt.

According to the studio, the film cost $500,000 (equivalent to around $ million today) to make and employed 2,000 people behind the scenes. Theda Bara appeared in a variety of costumes, some quite risqu√©. The film was a great success at the time. The picture was filmed on the Dominquez slough just outside Long Beach, California. The throne prop used in the film ended up, years later, in the possession of Leon Schlesinger Productions; its disposition after the acquisition of that company by Warner Bros. is unknown.Magill's Survey of Silent Films, Vol. 1.

After the Hays Code was implemented in Hollywood, Cleopatra was judged to be too obscene to be shown. However, despite its controversies, the film was a huge box office draw, becoming one of the most successful blockbusters of 1917.

He played college football at the University of Southern California. Early years Steele attended the now defunct St. Peter Chanel High School, where he lettered in football and basketball. He played only two years of football and missed most of his junior season with a broken ankle. As a senior, he played running back and middle linebacker, scoring 17 touchdowns in just 6 games, because he was suspended for poor grades. He enrolled Long Beach City College, where he collected 96 tackles, 20 tackles for loss, 8 sacks and 2 interceptions in his first year. As a sophomore he registered 93 tackles, 17 tackles for loss, 8 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, 2 blocked kicks, 4 carries for 39 yards (9.8-yard avg ) and 2 touchdowns, while helping the team achieve a No. 6 national ranking with a 10‚Äì1 record. In 1999, he transferred to the University of Southern California and was given the number 55, which is a school tradition reserved for the best linebackers. As a junior he was named the starter at weak-side linebacker. He played with a shoulder injury that required surgery at the end of the season, finishing with 91 tackles (second on the team), 62 solo tackles, 12 tackles for loss (led the team), 3 sacks, 6 passes defensed, one interception, 3 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries. The next year he had 61 tackles (third on the team), 17 tackles for loss (led the team) and 3 sacks. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Steele was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 4th round (122nd overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft, because he was seen as a great athlete that lacked football instincts. After strong- side linebacker Darren Hambrick was waived by the team, following the fifth game of the season, and with little depth at the linebacker position, he was named the starter as a rookie. He played in 15 games (10 starts), making 51 tackles, 2 tackles for loss, one quarterback pressure, one forced fumble and 3 special teams tackles. In 2002, he was relegated to a backup position after the Cowboys signed free agent Kevin Hardy. He still was able to start 3 games at middle linebacker because of injuries. He collected 18 tackles, one tackle for loss, 14 special teams tackles (fifth on the team) and blocked a punt against the San Francisco 49ers. The next season, although Hardy left via free agency, he could not unseat free agent Al Singleton from the starter role. He posted 2 defensive tackles and 16 special teams tackles (third on the team). Steele was waived on August 31, 2004, after playing in 42 games (12 starts), while totaling 71 tackles (49 solo) and 33 special teams tackles. =Denver Broncos= On January 1, 2005, Steele signed with the Denver Broncos as a free agent. He was released on August 30. =Northeast Ohio Predators = In 2013, he started playing, middle linebacker and coaching defense, for the Northeast Ohio Predators, which is a semi-professional team in the Heartland Football League.

This utilizes the spine rather than the shoulders as standard backpack straps do. Tumplines are not intended to be worn over the forehead, but rather over the top of the head just back from the hairline, pulling straight down in alignment with the spine.

It was dissolved in 2009. History Formed in 1980, Trintoc entered the Point Fortin Football League that same year and immediately won the League title and then entered the fourth division of the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation, which they also won in their first year. By the end of the decade Trintoc had won every title in local soccer (league champions in 1986 and 1988) and even became Caribbean champions in 1988 when they beat Seba United F.C. of Jamaica in the final. During this period another oil-based team, Trintopec, also rose to prominence and in 1992, the T&T; government decided to merge both companies, Trintoc and Trintopec to form Petrotrin. It was also decided to join both football squads and United Petrotrin was born. The team took up where Trintoc and Trintopec left off, winning several national championships, including two FA Trophy titles. However, soon after there was a change in the management of the company and funding for football was considerably reduced. As a result, United Petrotrin went into decline and the team was eventually disbanded. In an effort to revive football in the south, a group of concerned southerners formed the Southwest Institute of Football (SWIF), but the response from the business sector was poor. The Petrotrin chairman emerged as a saviour and with his support, United Petrotrin was reborn and the \\"oil squad\\" returned to top flight football.

The affected eye still senses the light and produces pupillary sphincter constriction to some degree, albeit reduced. Depending of severity, different symptoms may appear during the swinging flash light test: Mild RAPD will presents as a weak pupil constriction initially, after which dilation continues to happen. When RAPD is moderate, pupil size will remain, after which it dilates When RAPD is severe, the pupil will dilate quickly Cause The most common cause of Marcus Gunn pupil is a lesion of the optic nerve (between the retina and the optic chiasm) due to glaucoma, or severe retinal disease, or due to multiple sclerosis. It is named after Scottish ophthalmologist Robert Marcus Gunn. A second common cause of Marcus Gunn pupil is a contralateral optic tract lesion, due to the different contributions of the intact nasal and temporal hemifields. Diagnosis The Marcus Gunn pupil is a relative afferent pupillary defect indicating a decreased pupillary response to light in the affected eye. In the swinging flashlight test, a light is alternately shone into the left and right eyes. A normal response would be equal constriction of both pupils, regardless of which eye the light is directed at. This indicates an intact direct and consensual pupillary light reflex. When the test is performed in an eye with an afferent pupillary defect, light directed in the affected eye will cause only mild constriction of both pupils (due to decreased response to light from the afferent defect), while light in the unaffected eye will cause a normal constriction of both pupils (due to an intact efferent path, and an intact consensual pupillary reflex). Thus, light shone in the affected eye will produce less pupillary constriction than light shone in the unaffected eye. Anisocoria is absent. A Marcus Gunn pupil is seen, among other conditions, in optic neuritis. It is also common in retrobulbar optic neuritis due to multiple sclerosis but only for 3‚Äì4 weeks, until the visual acuity begins to improve in 1‚Äì2 weeks and may return to normal.Mumenthaler Neurology 4ed, Thieme 2004, page 486 Demyelinating diseases A total CN II lesion, in which the affected eye perceives no light, is very similar to a Marcus Gunn pupil; to distinguish them, in a CNII total lesion shining the light in the affected eye produces zero dilation nor constriction.

Contents From the Ashes includes a pair of booklets containing close to 130,000 words. Sidebars and summaries are included, as is an alphabetical directory of the Nations of Flanaess which reveals at a glance the races, populations, and other key data for more than 50 countries. A listing of adventure locations tells where all previously published Greyhawk scenarios occurred. The rune and glyph display from the original World of Greyhawk boxed set is included. A packet of reference cards is included, with most of them containing encounters and short adventures, in a format similar to that of The City of Greyhawk set. The trio of poster maps have the grid coordinates printed along the borders. \\"Book One, Atlas of the Flanaess\\", presents a broad overview of the eastern portion of Oerik, Oerth's major continent and the primary locale for Greyhawk campaigns. It starts with a lengthy historical summary, tracing 10 centuries of events from the early assaults of the Oeridian tribes through the aftermath of the great Greyhawk Wars. The cyclopedia entries follow the history lesson and take up the bulk of the text. \\"Book Two, the Campaign Book\\" focuses on the areas in and around the Free City of Greyhawk. As a consequence of the great war, much of the Old City was incinerated. Destitute property owners who can't afford to pay for restoration watch helplessly as their neighborhoods are overrun with beggars and street urchins. In the River Quarter, authorities fish out bodies with daggers in their backs. Refugees crowd the poorer districts, trade continues to decline, and Iuz, the fiendish ruler of a vast territory in the north central Flanaess, remains a constant threat. The set offers scenario hooks in a variety of formats and themes, and the \\"Tales of the Year of Peace\\" section lists about a dozen adventure springboards based on various Flanaess rumors. The two adventure outlines in the Campaign Book are \\"Into the Mistmarsh,\\" which involves a hunt for escaped thieves, and \\"The Sin Eater\\". Publication history It was published in 1992 by TSR as a boxed set of materials. The work was primarily designed and written by Carl Sargent, with cover art by Jeff Easley. Editing was by Anne Brown, and illustrations were by Ken Frank, Valerie Valusek, Eric Olson, and Robin Raab. This boxed set featured two 96-page books, three 32\\" √ó 21\\" map sheets, five monster sheets (in Monstrous Compendium format), and 20 reference cards. This set was part of the overhaul of the Greyhawk setting that began with The City of Greyhawk, followed by Greyhawk Wars. The accessory was the first major update of the entire campaign setting to be published after the first boxed set, World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting. From the Ashes focuses on the situation on the Flanaess in the immediate aftermath of the Greyhawk Wars. The tone of the materials is intentionally darker and more grim than publications set in the pre-Wars era, and was designed to re-energize TSR's sales of Greyhawk-related publications. The set was followed by related adventure modules and sourcebooks by Sargent including The Marklands, Iuz the Evil, and The City of Skulls. The boxed set consists of two books, Atlas of the Flanaess and Campaign Guide (both 96 pages long), as well as several maps and reference sheets. Reception Rick Swan reviewed From the Ashes for Dragon magazine #198 (October 1993). He calls From the Ashes \\"ambitious\\", and notes that \\"By combining heroic tradition with elements of dark fantasy, [Carl Sargent has] come up with a Greyhawk campaign that is both familiar and refreshingly unexpected. Nearly as nasty as the Dark Sun setting, the new, grimmer Greyhawk world is made to order for players who found the original version too flabby to be much fun.\\" He noted that this \\"lavish package\\" has \\"a lot of material to digest, but thankfully, the quality of the writing makes it go down easy. Sargent not only has a vivid imagination, but a strong command of the English language, a rare combination in an industry where publishers tend to value typing speed more than muscular prose. Despite the occasional creaky sentence [...] it‚Äôs a pleasure to read.\\" While he notes that the \\"Thoughtful sidebars and helpful summaries enhance the set‚Äôs reference value\\", he complains that \\"despite the tight editing and logical organization, it‚Äôs not always easy to find specific entries; a subject index or an expanded table of contents would‚Äôve helped\\". He also comments about the art and graphics: \\"To its detriment, the set emphasizes text over graphics, with few appealing visuals other than the color maps. Most of the illustrations depict generic fantasy scenes and have nothing much to do with the text they accompany. Those wanting maps of local neighborhoods or floor plans of important buildings will have to draw their own. The rune and glyph display, lifted virtually verbatim from the original World of Greyhawk boxed set, does little more than fill up a page.\\" However, he compliments the poster maps, calling them \\"terrific, rendered in rich hues and clear notations. Thanks to the grid coordinates printed along the borders, it's easy to find desired locations [...] The grid system is nearly as user-friendly as individually numbered hexes and makes for less clutter.\\" In \\"Book One, Atlas of the Flanaess\\", Swan complains that things \\"get off to a sluggish start\\" with the lengthy historical summary, noting that it is apparently necessary \\"to provide context and bring newcomers up to date. But it's also complicated and turgid, sort of like a lecture from a professor who left his sense of humor in his other suit.\\" He felt that the cyclopedia entries \\"pick up the pace a bit. Nevertheless, the casual reader may feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. [...] While much of this is interesting [...] Sargent doesn‚Äôt have the space he needs to do justice to an entire world. When you only have a few paragraphs to spend on a country, it‚Äôs tough to give more than a superficial overview.\\" He felt that in \\"Book Two, the Campaign Book\\", Sargent \\"shifts into high gear as he narrows his focus on the areas in and around the Free City of Greyhawk. It‚Äôs a virtuoso performance, with a flawless mix of exposition, atmosphere, and detail. Sargent sets the stage in the opening pages by painting a bleak picture of a struggling populace. [...] Uncertainty prevails, and player characters will find plenty to keep them on their toes.\\" Swan notes that the set's fantasy elements \\"stick pretty close to AD&D; conventions, bad news for old-timers who‚Äôve had their fill of sinister monsters, enchanted dungeons, and meddlesome deities. But Sargent's limber imagination enlivens even the weariest cliches. [...] Sargent has loaded the books with nifty details [...] making a trip through the text as fun as an Easter egg hunt.\\" He calls the offered scenario hooks \\"a mixed bag\\", noting that on the adventure springboards \\"with only a few paragraphs per entry, there's not much to work with\\" and that the two adventure outlines in the \\"Campaign Book\\" are not particularly satisfying, as \\"Into the Mistmarsh\\" involves a \\"garden-variety hunt\\" and \\"The Sin Eater\\" relies too heavily on die-rolls and \\"climaxes with a battle that may prove to be too deadly for all but the strongest or luckiest PCs\\". He does note that the reference-card adventures \\"benefit from thoughtful development and clever staging\\", with \\"Brainstorm\\" being \\"the best of a dud-free collection\\". Swan concludes his review by saying, \\"A few years ago, I was convinced that the Greyhawk setting had reached a creative dead end. Now I‚Äôm not so sure.

In 1901, the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina announced that the Netherlands accepted an ethical responsibility for the welfare of their colonial subjects. This announcement was a sharp contrast with the former official doctrine that Indonesia was a wingewest (region for making profit). It also marked the start of modern development policy; whereas other colonial powers talked of a civilising mission, which mainly involved spreading their culture to colonised peoples. The Policy emphasised improvement in material living conditions. It suffered, however, from severe underfunding, inflated expectations and lack of acceptance in the Dutch colonial establishment, and it had mostly ceased to exist by the onset of the Great Depression in 1930.Cribb, Robert (1993). \\"Development Policy in the Early 20th Century\\", in Jan-Paul Dirkse, Frans H√ºsken and Mario Rutten, eds, Development and Social Welfare: Indonesia‚Äôs Experiences under the New Order (Leiden: Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde), pp. 225-245. Formulation Students in Agricultural school for Indonesians in Java. The school was built during this period. In 1899, the liberal Dutch lawyer Conrad Theodor van Deventer published an essay in the Dutch journal De Gids which claimed that the Colonial Government had a moral responsibility to return the wealth that the Dutch had received from the East Indies to the indigenous population. Journalist Pieter Brooshooft (1845-1921), wrote about the moral duty of the Dutch to provide more for the peoples of the Indies. With the support of socialists and concerned middle- class Dutch, he campaigned against what he saw as the unjustness of the colonial surplus. He described the Indies indigenous peoples as \\"childlike\\" and in need of assistance, not oppression. Newspapers were one of the few mediums of Indies communication to the Dutch parliament, and as editor of the De Locomotief, the largest of the Dutch-language newspapers in the Indies, he published writing by Snouck Hurgronje on understanding Indonesians. Brooshooft sent reporters across the archipelago to report on local developments; they reported on the poverty, crop failure, famine and epidemics in 1900. Lawyers and politicians supportive of Brooshooft's campaigning had an audience with Queen Wilhelmina and argued that the Netherlands owed the peoples of the Indies a 'debt of honour'. In 1901, the Queen, under advice from her prime minister of the Christian Anti-Revolutionary Party, formally declared a benevolent \\"Ethical Policy\\" which was aimed at bringing progress and prosperity to the peoples of the Indies. The Dutch conquest of the Indies brought them together as a single colonial entity by the early 20th century, which was fundamental to the Policy's implementation. Proponents of the Policy argued that financial transfers should not be made to the Netherlands while conditions for the indigenous peoples of the archipelago were poor. Aims Supporters of the Policy were concerned about the social and cultural conditions holding back the native population. They tried to raise awareness among the natives of the need to free themselves from the fetters of the feudal system and to develop themselves along Western lines. On 17 September 1901, in her speech from the throne before the States-General, the newly crowned Queen Wilhelmina formally articulated the new policy - that the Dutch government had a moral obligation to the native people of the Dutch East Indies that could be summarised in the 'Three Policies' of Irrigation, Transmigration and Education. =Irrigation= Irrigation waterworks in Jember, East Java, built ca. 1927-1929. The Policy promoted efforts to improve the lot of the ordinary people through irrigation programmes, the introduction of banking services for the native population, and subsidies for native industries and handicrafts. =Migration= The Policy first introduced the concept of transmigration from over-populated Java to the less densely populated areas of Sumatra and Kalimantan, beginning with government-sponsored schemes from 1905 onwards. However, the numbers of people moved during the period of the Policy was a tiny fraction of the increase in population in Java during the same period. =Education= Koning Willem III school, Weltevreden, Batavia, 1919-1920. The opening of Western education to indigenous Indonesians began only at the beginning of the 20th century; in 1900. Only 1,500 went to European schools compared to 13,000 Europeans. By 1928, however, 75,000 Indonesians had completed Western primary education and nearly 6,500 secondary school, although this was still a tiny proportion of the population. Assessment The Policy was the first serious effort to create programmes for economic development in the tropics. It differed from the \\"civilising mission\\" of other colonial powers in emphasising material welfare rather than a transfer of culture. The educational component of the Policy was mainly technical as it did not aim at creating brown Dutchmen and women. The Policy foundered on two problems. First, the budgets allocated to the Policy's programmes were never sufficient to achieve its aims, with the result that many colonial officials became disillusioned with the possibility of achieving lasting progress. The financial stringencies of the Great Depression put a definitive end to the Policy. Second, the educational programmes of the Policy contributed significantly to the Indonesian National Revival, giving Indonesians the intellectual tools to organise and to articulate their objections to colonial rule. As a result, many in the colonial establishment saw the Policy as a mistake that was counter to Dutch interests.

From the back cover: \\"In Wild at Heart, John Eldredge invites men to recover their masculine heart, defined in the image of a passionate God.\\" The book has been received favorably by many, including Chuck Swindoll, who called it \\"the best, most insightful book I have read in at least the last five years.\\" Eldredge claims that men are bored; they fear risk, they refuse to pay attention to their deepest desires. He challenges Christian men to return to what he characterizes as authentic masculinity without resorting to a \\"macho man\\" mentality. Men often seek validation in venues such as work, or in the conquest of women, Eldredge observes. He urges men to take time out and come to grips with the desires of their hearts. Eldredge frames the book around his outdoor experiences and anecdotes about his family and references elements of pop culture such as the film Braveheart and lyrics from well-known songs.  Contents  = Movement One: Reflecting God and the Masculine Question = Wild at Heart has three main movements. The first establishes the fact that every aspect of a man, from his desires to who he is as a man, reflects God. Eldredge bases this belief off of Genesis 1:26-28 where God creates mankind in his image as male and female. Eldredge takes time to establish that the reason a man has the desires that he does and the reason why he is masculine is because he is, ultimately, an image-bearer of God. According to Eldredge, men reflect God uniquely in this way: they demonstrate God's ability to \\"come through\\" for his people. Men are made to \\"come through.\\" Eldredge asserts that all man carry a deep question that is uniquely a masculine question. The question goes like this: \\"Do I have what it takes?\\" = Movement Two: The Poser, the Wound, and the Healing = The second movement is, perhaps, the diciest part of the book. Eldredge asserts that all men carry a wound that hits men in the area of their deep question. Eldredge, drawing on Scripture and his experience as a counselor, demonstrates how all men create a false self by which they display themselves to the world at large. This false self, or identity, feigns strength and courage while hiding cowardice and fear. Eldredge calls this false self The Poser. Eldredge says that when men are wounded in they typically go to two extremes or some combination of the two: angry men or passive men. \\"Look around our churches and ask, 'What is the typical Christian man like?' The answer is usually bored, angry, or passive.\\" The first and deepest wound for most men, according to Eldredge, comes by way of the father. Eldredge says that the answer to a man's question and the healing of their wound can only be found in Jesus. Eldredge describes the journey of healing and restoration that God wants to take every man on so that they can begin to live life the way he intended for them: free and from their restored masculine heart. = Movement Three: The Core Desires of a Man's Heart = According to Eldredge, men have three core desires: battle, adventure, beauty. The first desire is for a \\"battle to fight.\\" Eldredge says that deep in the heart of every man is a warrior. He rejects the notion that men are crass, abusive, and violent. But what he does push for is a \\"fierceness\\" and \\"courage\\" that is the heart of a warrior--the ability to stand and fight for something. Eldredge says that for a man to be complete he must be fighting for something. The second desire is for an \\"adventure to live.\\" Eldredge points to the desire that most men have for exploration, creation, and adventure as uniquely masculine and a reflection of the heart of God. A man wants to be taken on a grand adventure and this is the invitation of the Gospel, says Eldredge. He points to many figures in Scripture such as Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and David who, when partnered with the call and will of God, were called on spectacular adventures. The third desire is for a \\"beauty to rescue.\\" Eldredge does not advocate male superiority or attempts to teach that women want or need to be subjugated by men. What he does point out is that in almost every story worth telling there is a beauty that needs rescuing in some fashion, whether it is from a dragon or a wicked stepmother or whether it is from fear and hopelessness. He makes it clear that, like men, women have three core desires also, but a man cannot answer her question. Eldredge moves beyond the notion that the Beauty equals a woman. Beauty can be found in nature, music, story, art, and ultimately in relationship with God. According to Eldredge, a man must become a \\"poet\\" in this regard--enjoying beauty outside of a woman--before he pursues a woman. Along the way, Eldredge constantly reminds his readers that only God can ultimately fulfill these three desires and the only reason a man has these three desires is because they are a reflection of the heart of God. Everything in Wild At Heart points to God as the center for life, fulfillment, and purpose, according to Eldredge.

The Fountain of Samson or Felitsiyal (, translit.: Fontan Samson, Felitsiial) is a Ukrainian Baroque fountain in the Podil raion of Kyiv. It was constructed in the 18th Century, later demolished by the Bolsheviks either in 1934 or 1935, and rebuilt in 1981. History It was constructed during 1748‚Äì1749 after the Podil magistrate's decision to repair the water distribution system. The project was assigned to Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi, a descendant of a well-known Podil family and a graduate of the Kyiv Mohyla Academy. The fountain was a pavilion-like circular rotunda with a cupola resting on four piers, with each pier embellished by two columns of Corinthian order. The dome of the fountain was topped by a gilded copper statue of St. Andrew. Before the 1800s a statue of an angel who held a chance from which water issued and ran into a basin was erected inside the fountain. In 1809, the angel was replaced by an almost life-size wooden sculpture of Samson, who was tearing the lion's jaws from which the water flowed, hence the name, Fountain of Samson. The sculpture was likely modeled upon Mikhail Kozlovsky's famous statue, a centerpiece of the Peterhof Palace Grand Cascade, with St. Samson symbolising the Russian victory over Sweden at Poltava: the lion is an element of Sweden's coat of arms and the battle was won on St. Samson Day. The fountain received its water supply from the Starokievskaya Gora through wooden pipes. The newly reconstructed Fountain of Samson. The reconstruction was completed in 1981. Before the start of World War I the two statues of St. Andrew and Samson were removed from the fountain and put into storage, which later proved beneficial as the Bolsheviks destroyed the structure altogether. In 1927 the rotunda's dome was repaired by the Kyiv City Council government. During 1935, the Architectural Planning Administration proposed to include the structure in a planned park on the Red Square (now the Kontraktova Square). According to a factually uncertain story, Communist Party official Pavel Postyshev, instructed the Chairman of the City Council, Ryzhkov, to remove the so-called \\"kiosk\\". Overnight the 18th century structure was dismantled. Its foundations however were preserved. The wooden statue of Samson. The statue survived the destruction of the original fountain and was reinstalled upon completion of the new fountain in 1981. During the second half of the 1970s a decision was made to reintroduce the lost historical atmosphere to the old merchant and artisans quarter of Ukrainian capital, as part of an effort to develop the Podil as a tourist center of Kyiv. In these plans the rebuilding of the Fountain of Samson was included. In the autumn of 1977, the government of the Ukrainian S.S.R. directed the City Council of Kyiv to rebuild the structure, which was finished in 1981. It was built according to designs by Ukrainian architect V. P. Shevchenko. Today the fountain has sundial clocks on the columns it contains concrete copies of the original statues of St. Andrew and Samson, the originals are on display in the National Art Museum of Ukraine.

He won the popular vote in the Bosnian presidential elections of 1990. In the early 1990s, during the Bosnian War, Abdiƒá declared his opposition to the official Bosnian government, and established the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, a small and short-lived province in the northwestern corner of Bosnia and Herzegovina composed of the town of Velika Kladu≈°a and nearby villages. The mini-state existed between 1993 and 1995 and was allied with the Army of Republika Srpska. In 2002 he was convicted on charges of war crimes against Bosniaks loyal to the Bosnian government by a court in Croatia and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, which was later reduced on appeal to 15 years by the Supreme Court of Croatia. On 9 March 2012, he was released after having served two thirds of his reduced sentence. Early life Fikret Abdiƒá was born in the village of Donja Vidovska, Velika Kladu≈°a, Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 29 September 1939. =Early career= Before the war, Abdiƒá was the director of Agrokomerc, a company based in Velika Kladu≈°a that he raised from a small agricultural cooperative into a modern food combine which employed over 13,000 workers, and which boosted the economy of the entire area. Agrokomerc transformed Velika Kladu≈°a from a poverty-struck region to a regional powerhouse. Local residents of Velika Kladu≈°a reportedly called him Babo (Dad). He ran the company with strong political backing from influential politician Hamdija Pozderac and his brother, Hakija. In late 1987, just before the death of Hamdija Pozderac, Raif Dizdareviƒá was about to take over the annual Presidency of Yugoslavia, during which a scandal arose. Abdiƒá found himself imprisoned for alleged financial improprieties, and Hamdija Pozderac resigned. The scandal shook not only the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the whole of Yugoslavia. Another of his controversial moves was erecting a monument to an Ottoman Bosnian ba≈üb√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ±, Mujo Hrnjica, on a hill above Velika Kladu≈°a. After his release from prison, he made a last-minute decision to join the Party of Democratic Action and run for the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990 elections. Under the constitution, voters elected seven members to the presidency: two Bosniaks, two Serbs, two Croats, and one Yugoslav. He and his future rival Alija Izetbegoviƒá ran for the two Bosniak positions, and were both elected. Once the positions were filled, the members of the presidency elected a President of the Presidency who acted as its head. Abdiƒá won more popular votes than Izetbegoviƒá, but did not assume office for reasons which remain unknown to the public. Bosnian War According to NIN, Abdiƒá briefly appeared in Sarajevo when the Bosnian War broke out, hoping to assume the presidency after Izetbegoviƒá had been arrested by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). However, he was preempted by Izetbegoviƒá having already named Ejup Ganiƒá for that position. A few months later, Abdiƒá decided to return to Bihaƒá, where he was well-known locally as an opponent of Izetbegoviƒá's government. Using his expansive network of business connections, Abdiƒá was able to keep the city supplied with consumer goods such as cigarettes, coffee and detergent, even as it was under siege by Serb forces. This gained Abdiƒá so much popularity among the city's inhabitants that in 1993 he was able to reincorporate Bihaƒá and its surroundings as the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APZB) and install himself as governor. Though characterised as treasonous by the Bosnian government, Abdiƒá's fiefdom was recognized by Croat and Serb leaders, who were happy to weaken the Bosnian government in light of the Karaƒëorƒëevo and Graz agreements that aimed to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia. Abdiƒá established prison camps for those who fought for the Bosnian government. Detainees at the camps were subjected to killings, torture, sexual assaults, beatings and other cruel and inhumane treatment. In addition to Abdiƒá's paramilitary forces, a paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the Scorpions participated in the war crimes on Bosniaks.Voice of America: \\"Fikretu Abdiƒáu 20 godina zatvora\\", voanews.com, 31 July 2002. When the 5th Corps of Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), based in the south part of the Bihaƒá pocket in western Bosnia tried to end the existence of APZB, Abdiƒá raised an army which was supplied, trained, financed by (and fought alongside) the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) and Serbian counterintelligence against the ARBiH and Bosniaks loyal to Izetbegoviƒá. The Serbs took advantage of the situation and strengthened their and Abdiƒá's positions. In August 1995, an ARBiH offensive ended the APZB forcing him to flee to Croatia. Lord Owen, a British diplomat and co-author of the Vance-Owen and Owen-Stoltenberg peace plans described Abdiƒá as \\"forthright, confident and different from the Sarajevan Muslims. He was in favour of negotiating and compromising with Croats and Serbs to achieve a settlement, and scathing about those Muslims who wanted to block any such settlement.\\"Balkan Odyssey After the war After the war he was granted political asylum and citizenship by the Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman, and lived near Rijeka. The government of Bosnia-Herzegovina charged him with the deaths of 121 civilians, three POWs and the wounding of 400 civilians at Bihaƒá. Croatia refused, however, to extradite him. After Tuƒëman's death in 1999, and the change in government in Croatia the following year, Croatian authorities arrested and tried him. In 2002 he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for war crimes committed in the area of the \\"Bihaƒá pocket\\". In 2005 the Croatian Supreme Court reduced the sentence to 15 years. Abdiƒá ran for the position of Bosniak member of the Bosnian presidency in 2002 on the Democratic People's Community party ticket in 2002 and won 4.1% of the vote. Bosnian law does not bar him from running for office since his conviction is in Croatia. He was released from prison on 8 March 2012, after serving ten of his 15-years sentence. Abdiƒá was LS BiH's candidate for the mayor of Velika Kladu≈°a in the 2016 Bosnian municipal elections. He received 9,026 votes, or 48.10%, and was elected as the new mayor.

It was built 1604-07 by John Urquhart of Craigfintry (died 1631), known as the Tutor of Cromarty. The castle is composed of two main wings flanking the entrance and connected by an elevated arch, and surmounted by a richly corbelled parapet. There are bases for corner turrets near the top corner of each wing, but the turrets themselves do not appear to have ever been completed. The wood carvings in the drawing room depict biblical themes and Clan Urquhart heraldic artifacts. Craigston Castle belongs to the \\"Bell group\\" of Scottish castles, designed by masons of the Bell or Bel family, and which, according to H. Gordon Slade, \\"together form perhaps Scotland‚Äôs finest and the most distinctive contribution to Western architecture\\". The castle is still owned and lived in by the Urquhart family, who trace their descent back to Adam Urquhart, 14th-century sheriff of Cromarty, although according to Sir Thomas Urquhart, translator of Rabelais, the family can be traced back to Adam and Eve through \\"Termuth\\", who he states found Moses in the rushes, as well as many other fantastic ancestors. Craigston Castle Drawing RoomCraigston Castle Grounds John Urquhart of Craigfintry, known as the \\"Tutor of Cromarty\\", built the castle in 1604 to 1607, and the design of the castle appears to show his influence as compared with other examples of the \\"Bell group\\". It was sold by the Urquharts in 1657, but bought back in 1739 by Captain John Urquhart, known as \\"the pirate\\", great-grandson of the builder. The new owner built the flanking wings, and laid out new gardens, though apparently not to the designs prepared in 1733 by William Adam, the foremost architect of the time. In the 1830s John Smith, the architect of Balmoral Castle, prepared designs for an extensive remodelling, though only a new entrance doorway was built. Craigston Castle is now a category A listed building. The Urquhart family retain possession of the castle, and have recently started to host weddings and other events, as well as letting it out as accommodation.

It has a dream-like narrative in which a woman, played by Deren, is washed up on a beach and goes on a strange journey encountering other people and other versions of herself. Deren once said that the film is about the struggle to maintain one's personal identity. The composer John Cage and the poet and film critic Parker Tyler were involved in making the film, and appear in the film, which was shot at Amagansett, Long Island. Synopsis At the beginning of the film, a woman is lying on a beach as if she has been washed up by the ocean. She climbs a tree with some difficulty, but when she finally reaches the top, she finds herself at the end of a long dining room table during a bourgeois dinner party. All the guests ignore her as she drags herself on top of the table and pulls herself across it, trying to reach a man (played by graphic designer Alvin Lustig) at the opposite end who looks deeply concentrated on a chess game. When she finally gets to the man, he stands up and leaves the table; she looks disappointed and hopeless. The chess pieces begin to move by themselves, and one of the pawns falls on the floor. It floats down a waterfall and down a river. The woman chases it, climbing down the hill she had already passed. She then finds herself walking down a forest path; she begins talking and walking with a man, who in total is replaced four times by four different men (the first one is the American surrealist poet, Philip Lamantia at age 17; the second man is Gregory Bateson; the third is artist and composer John Cage; and the last one Deren's real-life husband, Alexander Hammid). She follows the man into a house where all the furniture is covered with white blankets. She opens many doors, and in one room finds a bed on which a man is lying covered in a white blanket as if laid out in death. They stare at each other for some moments; then a cat leaps from her arms, and she turns her back and leaves. After walking through several doors, she finds herself on a hilltop, and climbs down to a dune field. Walking down the beach, she picks up stones, finding it hard to carry all of them at once. Then she finds two of the women who were at the dinner party in the beginning of the film playing chess on the beach. They are gossiping, having a good time while playing. The woman gets closer and watches them. She caresses their heads gently, making them lose their attention on the game. Then she takes the white queen from the game and runs across the dunes with her arms raised. While she runs, we see other versions of herself, at earlier stages in her journey; her other selves all glance at her. The film's final image is of the woman running down the beach, leaving her footprints behind her. Trivia The chess game shown at the beginning and the end is Anderssen - Kieseritzky, proclaimed as the Immortal Game. Influences on popular culture The scenes of Deren on the beach, and of the chess games are referenced in the music video for the band Garbage's 2012 single \\"Blood for Poppies\\". http://www.live4ever.uk.com/2012/04/garbage-start-useurope-tour- premiere-new-video/ The Herb Ritts directed music video for Madonna's 1989 single \\"Cherish\\" is largely inspired by At Land. http://thenewinquiry.tumblr.com/post/243921042/maya-derens-1944-film-at-land- compare-with English rock musician and former Pink Floyd member David Gilmour, used footage from the film in the official music video for his song \\"Faces of Stone\\", directed by Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis.

History The cuisine of the Volga Tatars takes its origin from the cuisine of the Volga Bulgars, who once were nomads, but nearly 1500 years ago turned to agriculture and assimilated into local agricultural societies. Tatar cuisine was influenced by the surrounding peoples ‚Äì Russians, Mari, Udmurts, and also peoples of Central Asia, especially Uzbeks. Dishes such as pilaw (pilaf), halvah (x√§lw√§), and sherbet (≈üirb√§t) entered long ago into the Tatar culture. Tatars became familiar with many elements of Russian cuisine early in their history. However, culinary influences and greater variety of products have not changed the basic ethnic features of Tatar cuisine but have instead made it more diverse. Geography and nature were also instrumental in the shaping of the Tatar cuisine. The location of the Tatars at the border of two geographical zones ‚Äì the northern forests and the southern steppe, and also in the basin of two large rivers ‚Äì the Volga and the Kama encouraged trade and considerably enriched the national cuisine. The Tatars became acquainted early in their history with rice, tea, dried fruits, walnuts, seasonings, and spices. The Tatar cuisine relies heavily on the main agricultural products of the region ‚Äì cereals and livestock. Fruits and vegetables were much less developed in the region's agriculture, although the relative importance of the potato began to increase from the end of the 19th century. Local vegetables included onions, carrot, horseradish, turnips, pumpkins, beets and, in small quantities, also cucumbers and cabbage. Fruits were mainly grown in orchards on the right bank of Volga, including local apple, cherries, raspberries, and currants. The forests were a source for wild berries, walnuts, hops, cow parsnip, sorrel, mint, and common wild leeks. Mushrooms were not typical in traditional Tatar cooking, and they began to be used only recently, especially among the urban population. Cattle and sheep provided beef and mutton, both equally popular among the Tatars. Horse meat was eaten boiled, salted, and cured. Milk was used primarily in dairy products, such as curds, sour cream, etc. Poultry was widespread in local farms (chickens, geese), and eggs were a popular dish, eaten in various forms. Beekeeping in the forest-steppe belt produced an abundance of honey for local consumption. Traditional Tatar cuisine ≈ûulpa with noodles Pilaw (pilaf) Qƒ±stƒ±b√≠ Boxara k√§l√§w√§se and √ß√§k√ß√§k. Qazƒ±lƒ±q as part of a horsemeat platter (on the right) The dishes in Tatar cuisine can be subdivided into the following categories: * hot soups, * main courses, * baked items with a savory filling (also eaten as main course), * dough-based dishes (pasta), * sweet baked items and other sweets, usually served with tea. =Soups= Depending on the broth (≈üulpa) used as the soup base, soups are divided into meat, chicken, fish, vegetable, mushroom, etc. The soup may be thickened with noodles, grains, or vegetables ‚Äì separately or in combination. Particularly popular is noodle soup served with toqma√ß (homemade noodles) and enriched with pieces of boiled meat or chicken from the broth. Soups are often served with meat balls or stuffed buns (√∂√ßpo√ßmaq, p√§r√§m√§√ß, bawƒ±rsaq). A festive and to a certain extent ceremonial dish for the Tatar is pilm√§n (pelmeni in Russian), a kind of dumpling filled with meat and always served in a clear soup. =Main courses= Main dishes are usually based on meat, grains, and potatoes. Meat or chicken boiled in the broth is cut into small pieces and served as a main course, sometimes quickly fried in oil with onions, carrots, and bell peppers. Boiled potatoes are a favorite side dish, with grated horseradish served as an accompaniment. A chicken stuffed with eggs in milk (tutƒ±rƒüan tawƒ±q) is a special dish for holidays. B√§li≈ü is the oldest traditional dish combining meat and grains. Pieces of fat meat (mutton, beef, goose, or goose and duck innards) are combined with grains (millet, spelt, rice) and baked in a crock. Tutƒ±rma, an intestine filled with finely cut or chopped liver and millet or rice, is another combination of meat and grains. Pilaw (pilaf) is served at dinner parties, especially in the city. A popular local version is the so- called Kazan pilaw prepared with boiled meat. Dishes combining boiled meat with noodles include qullama or bi≈übarmaq, common for many Turkic peoples. Meat is stored in the winter naturally frozen; it is preserved for the spring and the summer by salting or curing. Horse meat is used to make sausages (qazƒ±lƒ±q); cured goose and duck are considered a delicacy. Poultry eggs, primarily those of chickens, are a very popular dish in Tatar cuisine. They are eaten boiled, fried, and baked. Grains are made into a variety of porridges: millet, buckwheat, oatmeal, rice, peas, etc. =Baked foods= A wide variety of dough dishes is a feature of the traditional Tatar cuisine. Unleavened dough is traditionally used for buns, both sweet and savory, flatbreads, and biscuits. Leavened yeast dough is used to make bread (ikm√§k, ipi), which is always served with meals. Bread was traditionally baked from rye flour, and only the wealthy could afford wheat bread. Today, both wheat and rye bread are found in stores. Qabartma is a kind of yeast dough pancake that may be prepared in different ways: baked in a pan in front of an open oven fire, or fried in boiling oil in a cauldron. Qabartma is eaten hot, thickly spread with butter. Liquid batter is also prepared with and without yeast. Pancakes (qoymaq) are made from unleavened batter using wheat flour. Bliny-style pancakes are made from yeast batter using different types of flour (oats, peas, buckwheat, millet, wheat, or mixed). Yeast-batter qoymaq is thicker than the Russian bliny. It is usually served for breakfast, accompanied by melted butter in a small dish. Various baked items with a savory filling are specific for the Tatar cuisine. The oldest and simplest is qƒ±stƒ±b√≠, also called k√ºzikm√§k. This is an unleavened pancake folded into two and filled with cooked millet. Since the end of the 19th century, qƒ±stƒ±b√≠ has been made with mashed potatoes. B√§le≈ü made from unleavened or fermented dough is filled with pieces of fatty meat (mutton, beef, goose, duck, etc.) mixed with grains or potatoes. B√§le≈ü used to be made for special occasions in the shape of a low truncated cone with an opening on top. Subsequently the name began to be used for ordinary pies with different fillings, similar to the Russian pirog. Another traditional Tatar pie is √∂√ßpo√ßmaq, a triangular shell originally filled with a mixture of fatty meat and onions. Later pieces of potato began to be added to the filling. P√§r√§m√§√ß (peremech) is a round-shaped minced meat pie, fried and served hot sprinkled with melted butter. Except for the round shape, it is similar to the √ßib√∂rek (cheburek) of the Crimean Tatars. B√§kk√§n (or t√§k√§), particularly widespread in rural areas, is an individual oval or crescent-shaped pie (like large pirozhki), filled with various vegetables (mainly pumpkin, also carrots or cabbage). Sumsa is a similar pie, usually with a meat and rice filling. A special festive dish among urban Kazan Tatars is g√∂b√§di√§, a tall round pie with a multilayer filling, which includes rice, dried fruits, and qort (a kind of dried salty cheese). =Sweets= The Tatar cuisine offers a variety of baked sweets, usually served with tea: √ßelpek (deep-fried pancakes), qatlama (a baked roll with a variety of fillings ‚Äì poppy seeds, sesame seeds, qort, nuts), qo≈ü tele (\\"bird's tongue\\", deep-fried squares or diamonds of unleavened dough), lawa≈ü (fried dumplings filled with raisins), pa≈ütet (sweet pies filled with jam or dried fruits) etc. √á√§k√ß√§k (chakchak, chak-chak, or chek-chek) is a mound of honey-drenched sweet pastry balls, common among all Turkic peoples. It used to be a ceremonial food brought by the bride to the reception at the bridegroom's home. Today it is a common sweet. Honey is very popular in baking and on its own, served with tea. =Beverages= √Ñyr√§n (ayran) is a dairy drink made by diluting qatƒ±q (katyk, sour milk) with cold water. Quas (kvass) is a beverage made from rye flour and malt that the Tatars have borrowed from the Russians. A kompot of dried apricots is a popular dessert at dinner parties. Another non-alcoholic sweet beverage is ≈üirb√§t (sherbet) made from honey. In the 19th and early 20th century it was a purely ceremonial drink, served to wedding guests as the \\"bride's sherbet\\" in the bridegroom's home. Tea is a typical hospitality beverage among the Tatars. They drink hot, strong tea, usually with milk. Tea with baked sweets (qabartma, pancakes) sometimes replaces cooked breakfast. Cooking methods and utensils Food is prepared in traditional Tatar cuisine mainly by boiling, frying, and baking. Frying is primarily used for dough-based foods, much less for meats, which are typically boiled (except meat for pilaw, which requires quick frying). Both boiling and frying were traditionally done in a cast-iron cauldron built into the side of the large kitchen stove. Baking was done in an oven. Cooking over an open fire was not common. This method was used for making pancakes (t√§√ße qoymaq) and fried eggs (t√§b√§). Cast-iron utensils and crock pots were commonly used in the oven. Large deep cast-iron pans served to bake b√§le≈ü and g√∂b√§di√§. Wooden utensils were widely used for various tasks. Bread dough was kneaded in wooden troughs and then allowed to rise in wooden or wicker bowls. Butter was made in wooden churns. Honey and qatiq were stored in wooden containers. Commercially manufactured kitchen utensils, including metallic and enameled pots and pans, china, and glassware, became increasingly accepted starting in the middle of the 19th century. Tea service has always been the subject of special attention among the Tatar. Tea is drunk from small cups (so that it remains hot). Typical Tatar cups are small and low, with a rounded bottom and a saucer. The traditional Tatar tea service invariably includes a samovar. The introduction of modern gas stoves and microwave ovens has led to the adoption of new cooking techniques, mainly increasing the popularity of frying (meat, fish, vegetables). The modernization of kitchenware has deprived cauldrons, cast iron pans, and many wooden utensils of their traditional role. The average family now uses a wide range of aluminum and enameled cookware. Modern cuisine The Tatar cuisine, while preserving the national traditions, has undergone substantial changes. Economic and cultural changes have introduced many new dishes, enriching the traditional cuisine. More fruits and vegetables are now used than traditionally, fish has become more popular, mushrooms, tomatoes, and pickles are in common use. The opening up of international trade has given access to fruits and vegetables that were previously regarded as exotic, i.e., bananas, kiwi, mango, eggplant, etc. National cuisines of other peoples of the former Soviet Union, especially the Russian cuisine, have influenced the modern eating habits of the Tatar. On the other hand, the uniqueness of the national Tatar dishes ensures their continued popularity among other nations.

Both the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries arise from the abdominal aorta. Each of these arteries travel through the mesentery, within which they branch several times before reaching the gut. In humans, many of these branches are named, but in smaller animals the branches are more variable. In some animals, including humans, branches of these arteries join with the marginal artery of the colon, which means that occlusion of one of the main arteries does not necessarily lead to the death of the part of the gut that it usually supplies. The term mesenteric artery is also used to describe smaller branches of these vessels which, particularly in smaller animals, provide a significant source of vascular resistance. These branches have a dense innervation by sympathetic nerves, allowing the brain to control their diameter and hence the resistance to blood flow to the gut. This is of particular importance when blood flow is required elsewhere, such as in exercise or shock, where a large proportion of the blood is required to supply the needs of skeletal muscle; by constricting the smaller mesenteric vessels, the resistance of blood flow to the gut increases, and hence blood flows more readily to other organs.

The best known is Thylacoleo carnifex, also called the marsupial lion. The clade ranged from the Late Oligocene to the Pleistocene, with some species the size of a possum and others as large as a leopard. As a whole, they were largely arboreal, in contrast to the mostly terrestrial dasyuromorphs (quolls only recently took the niches vacated by small thylacoleonids), monitor lizards and mekosuchines. Hypercarnivory was also found in another order of marsupials, the dasyuromorph family Thylacinidae that included the Tasmanian tiger Thylacinus cynocephalus that became extinct in the twentieth century.  Description  Illustration of lower dentition reconstructed by Owen, 1877 A diprotodontian family allied to the Vombatiformes, mammals that radiated and diversified in the Oligocene to Miocene. The thylacoleonid genera exhibit specialised dentition that allowed them to kill prey larger than themselves. The earliest descriptions, of the most recent species, recognised the secateur-like blades of the teeth as a powerful mammalian predator, a \\"marsupial lion\\", that were noted as missing in the Australian environment. The third premolars exhibit this blade-like development, becoming greatly enlarged in the Pleistocene species Thylacoleo carnifex, prompting the description by Owen as \\"‚Ä¶one of the fellest and most destructive of predatory beasts\\". They are seen as presumably occupying a trophic level as peak predators in their local ecologies, some smaller and arboreal climbers or those terrestrial species comparable to large dog or a big cat.  Distribution and habitat  The genera are associated with the late Oligocene and Miocene epochs. Microleo and Wakaleo have been located at the Lake Pitikanta fossil area in Central Australia and toward the northern coast at Riversleigh, below the gulf of Carpentaria, a rich source of fossil fauna. The most recent species, Thylacoleo carnifex, existed at least until the Pleistocene, the earliest known specimens of the family are dated to around twenty five million years ago. Taxonomy  The family was described by Theodore Gill in a systematic revision of mammalian taxa published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1872. The name is derived from the genus named by Richard Owen, Thylacoleo, which he recognised as a potent carnivore and described as marsupial version of the modern lions (Leo). They are now thought to be allied with the Vombatiformes, still represented in the modern Australian fauna by koalas and wombats. They appear to have diverged by specialising in a carnivorous diet in the early Oligocene, and increased in size along with their prey during the Miocene. A revision of the family was published in 2017, enabled by the discovery of a skull of an early species, named as Wakaleo schouteni, which allowed closer comparison with previously described species and the more complete fossil record of the lineages. The study by Anna Gillespie, Mike Archer and Suzanne Hand, revised the description of Wakaleo to include a new species and circumscribe taxa previously assigned to Priscileo. =Classification= Four genera are currently accepted as belonging to this family: *Incertae sedis ::* Lekaneleo roskellyae Riversleigh fauna, Early Miocene :*Genus Microleo ::* Microleo attenboroughi (Early Miocene) *Subfamily Wakaleoninae :*Genus Wakaleo ::* Wakaleo pitikantensis (Upper Oligocene) ::* Wakaleo schouteni (Upper Oligocene‚ÄîLower Miocene) ::* Wakaleo oldfieldi (Lower Miocene‚ÄîUpper Miocene) ::* Wakaleo vanderleuri (Middle Miocene‚ÄîUpper Miocene) ::* Wakaleo alcootaensis (Upper Miocene) *Subfamily Thylacoleoninae :*Genus Thylacoleo ::* Thylacoleo crassidentatus (Pliocene) ::* Thylacoleo hilli (Pliocene) ::* Thylacoleo carnifex (Pleistocene) References Prehistoric diprotodonts Carnivorous marsupials Prehistoric mammals of Australia Chattian first appearances Pleistocene extinctions ","title":"Thylacoleonidae"},{"id":"5035684","text":"James Hamilton, Viscount Hamilton (7 October 1786 ‚Äì 27 May 1814) was a British nobleman and politician. Birth and education The eldest son of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn, James Hamilton was born at Petersham Lodge, Surrey, on 7 October 1786, and baptized on 4 November at Petersham. From the age of 5 Hamilton was tutored by his father's domestic chaplain, William Howley, who was later to become Bishop of London, and Archbishop of Canterbury. Later, he was educated at Harrow School, where he was a lieutenant, and then captain of volunteers in 1803. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 24 October 1805. Political career Lord Abercorn intended to put Hamilton up as a candidate for County Donegal as soon as he could obtain sufficient interest there, or else for County Tyrone. The death of Abercorn's personal agent, James Hamilton, in 1806, damaged his personal interest in Donegal, and Viscount Hamilton was obliged to retire before the contest. Instead, he was put in (while underage) for Dungannon by Abercorn's political ally, Thomas Knox, 1st Viscount Northland, at a by-election in January 1807. At the 1807 general election, in May, Abercorn declined a compromise with Earl Conyngham to put Hamilton in at Donegal, and he was instead returned, still underage, for Liskeard, by his half-cousin Lord Eliot. Private life On 25 November 1809, in London, he married Harriet Douglas, granddaughter of James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton, by whom he had three children: * James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn (1811‚Äì1885) * Harriet Hamilton (1812‚Äì1884), married Admiral William Alexander Baillie-Hamilton and had issue * Lord Claud Hamilton (1813‚Äì1884) He evidently suffered from chronic illness, as his father described him as \\"long dying\\" in declining an offer from Lord Eliot to return him for Liskeard again in 1812, although he was a founding member of Grillion's that year. He died in his house in Upper Brook Street on 27 May 1814. His eldest son, James, would succeed his grandfather as Marquess of Abercorn four years later.

Introduction Durham Johnston is a 1500-place 11‚Äì18 school serving Durham City and communities beyond to the south and west. It is situated on Crossgate Moor, on the A167 (the former Great North Road). Durham Johnston traces its history to the foundation of a county grammar school for girls and boys in Durham City, partly funded by the will of Susan, widow of James Finlay Weir Johnston, in 1901 in South Street. Johnston is a Language College and a lead school for Gifted and Talented education, with full International Status. It is usually oversubscribed and runs on strict admissions criteria based entirely on students' addresses, managed by the County Council. The local Labour MP, Roberta Blackman-Woods is a governor of the school and was formerly Chair of Governors. History Durham Johnston was founded in 1901 with money left to the County Council by Susan, widow of JFW Johnston who died in 1855. He was a pioneering educator, influential also in the development of Durham University and the colleges which became Newcastle University. He worked to bring education to a wide range of people ‚Äì rich and poor, male and female ‚Äì and believed that it should be secular, useful and scientific as well as historical and literary. The first Johnston was, unusually, a mixed grammar technical school until 1918, when a girls‚Äô grammar school was built which is now the Durham Gilesgate Sixth Form Centre. The Johnston School opened in 1901 with 13 pupils. They came from a range of backgrounds. James Jefferson and William Potts were the sons of schoolmasters, John Wetherell's father was the manager of the City Swimming Baths; Arnold Shaw's father was a clergyman while Mary Martin's father owned Martin's Flour Mill in the City. Elizabeth Herbert's father was a clerk and Lydia Pearson's a signalman. Frances Guthrie was simply described as ‚Äòorphan‚Äô. The first building was in South Street, which was then extended into some former housing and Mr Dean's Stocking Factory. Though the school had a beautiful view it was cold, damp and unsuitable for education. Rebuilding was held up by the second world war but ‚ÄòThe Johnstonian‚Äô of spring 1948 reported: So the third headmaster of the school, Christopher Storey ended his first prize day speech with the words When the school was finally begun in 1950 it was described as On the school‚Äôs 50th anniversary one of the teachers wrote in the Johnstonian There were 34 boys in the sixth form when the new school opened. Headmaster Storey‚Äôs hope was fulfilled: Durham Johnston school now is very different. The Johnston community as it is now was put together after 1979 when grammar schools in County Durham were abolished. The Modern Schools in Brandon and Whinney Hill closed, followed by Lansdowne School in Bowburn. Durham Johnston Comprehensive School worked as a split-site school for 30 years with years 7 and 8 at Whinney Hill and years 9 to upper sixth in the Grammar School buildings. (The old annexe buildings were bought in 1968 when the Cottage Homes Orphanage closed, and was fitted out as a sixth form centre which opened in 1969, the year that girls returned to Johnston.) In 1982, Durham County Council proposed to close the sixth form of the school, and those of Framwellgate Moor and Gilesgate, and create a sixth form college on the site Wearside site of Gilesgate school. Sir Keith Joseph rejected the proposal on the grounds that it would have been too disruptive and costly. Successive years and governments brought planning blight and hopes deferred once again until the school buildings reached an advances state of dilapidation. However, after the efforts of Head Richard Bloodworth (1999‚Äì2004) and Chair of Governors Roberta Blackman-Woods (later MP for the City of Durham) it was rebuilt in 2006-9. Carolyn Roberts, Head since 2005, said to the students as the school moved in 2009 When the Lower School Council came from Whinney Hill to visit the new building they said: Gordon Brown's Labour Cabinet held a meeting and public consultation in February 2010 and praised the school for its commitment to academic excellence, social justice and global future.http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/tees/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8523000/8523963.stm Cabinet meeting February 2010 It was the first cabinet meeting in the North East, and the first in a school. In October 1998, it was the first comprehensive school to enter the Financial Times top 1,000 schools. The new school cost ¬£24m. Durham Johnston's War Memorial 1921‚Äì2011 Durham Johnston in 2011 raised funds to re-site and rededicate the school war memorial, which names 107 men. The majority were members of the Durham Light Infantry, although they served in both wars and in a variety of services and regiments. The memorial was first suggested in a speech by Mr Whalley, the school's Headmaster, in 1920. He referred to the death of Captain C.N. Crawshaw, a teacher at the school who had volunteered when the war broke out in 1914. Mr Whalley proposed a memorial in honour of the 34 former students and one teacher who had died during the Great War. A meeting was held on Wednesday 24 March 1920 for former and current students and ¬£160 was raised towards the cost of the memorial. The original panels of the war memorial were unveiled at 6 p.m. on Saturday 22nd [month?] 1921 by the Bishop of Durham. It was located on the stage of the school, when the school was located in South Street. It acted as a memorial for the 35 ex-Johnstonians who had died during the Great War. In addition to the former students, one member of staff, Mr Crawshaw, had died in action. Two teachers returned to the school after the war, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Dent, and a third, Mr Cousins, returned, but retired, due to war related stress, in 1921. The unveiling of the memorial was recorded by the Durham Advertiser: :The memorial has been erected by subscriptions from parents, staff past and present and pupils of the school. It consists of a mural panelling in light oak, of classic design, together with a memorial desk and chairs of a similar character. On the memorial desk is a brass inscription plate on which is engraved: ‚ÄòA tribute from the boys of 1918‚Äì1920 to the Johnstonians who served and fell in the war, 1914‚Äì1918.' The design and erection of the memorial have been ably carried out by the North of England School Furnishing Company. In addition to the brass inscription plate there is an engraving which states 'Nothing is here for tears, nothing but fair and well, and what may quiet us in a death so noble.' The motto for the memorial is taken from Milton‚Äôs Samson Agonistes. The memorial has been erected in the school assembly hall, and will daily remind the boys of the patriotism and self sacrifices of Johnstonians during the dark days of the war. A large number of former Johnstonians were involved in World War II with a significant number losing their lives. Two new panels were commissioned for the war memorial and money was, again, raised from contributions. The two panels were dedicated in June 1948 with a ceremony, performed by the Reverend R.F. Morgan ‚Äì a former student at the school ‚Äì at St Margaret's Church. A significant amount of money was raised from subscriptions. After the new panels had been paid for the residue of the money was used for a War Memorial prize, which was awarded annually to a high achieving student at the school. A tradition was established after 1948 that fresh flowers would always be put next to the memorial during term time and that a British Legion wreath of Flanders poppies would be placed next to the memorial on Remembrance Day. In July 1954 the school moved from its South Street site to new buildings in Crossgate Moor. The memorial was removed in July 1954 and placed upon the left wall in the new school hall. It remained in place until the spring term of 2009, when it was removed and stored in preparation to be rededicated in the new Durham Johnston school hall. It was reinstalled in the third building and dedicated in March 2011 in recognition of the 90th anniversary of Johnston, with students and members of the local community raising the money for the initial memorial. A new plaque has been installed with a quotation from the Proverbs to acknowledge money raised by the current students. Local companies, particularly Harrison and Harrison Organ Builders, helped to support this project. Notable on the war memorial is Captain Isidore Newman, an old boy of the school and linguist who was attached to the SOE during the second world war. He was eventually captured and murdered at Mauthausen Concentration Camp. Because of this, the rededication of the memorial in 2011 was attended by representatives of AJEX, the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and the Rabbi to the Army performed a blessing in the school, as well as the local Anglican Vicar. Traditions The school is named after James Finlay Weir Johnston, a professor of Chemistry at Durham University. He was an autodidact polymath committed to free secular education. Its motto is Sapere Aude, meaning \\"Dare to be wise\\". History and Names in the New Johnston Durham Johnston has a long history ‚Äì a great school on a vital historical site. The new building is large, so to make the different areas more memorable the school named some of them after parts of its history. Johnstonian Names Some areas in the new building are named after James Finlay Weir Johnston (1796‚Äì1855)who bequeathed money to set up a school for girls and boys, teaching science and the arts to ordinary young people of Durham, rich or poor. The main street on the ground floor is James Street, on the first floor is Finlay Street, on the top floor Weir Street. The assembly hall is therefore the James Hall. The quotation outside the door is the name of JFW Johnston's most successful book ‚Äì an 800-page 2-volume work called ‚ÄòThe Chemistry of Common Life‚Äô. The Library is called Lydia, for Lydia Pearson. She was the first pupil to enter Johnston's first new building in South Street in 1901. Battlefield Names Some of the areas are named after the great battle of Neville's Cross which was fought on the site in 1346. It was between the English and the Scots: the English won. The ground floor of the 2-storey block is David Street, named after the defeated Scottish king. The ground floor of the 3-storey block is Edward Street, named after the victorious English king, though he was not at the battle. The PE corridor is called Neville Street after one of the English commanders. He was described in the Lanercost Chronicle as \\"strong, truthful, cautious and brave\\". The music and drama corridor is Zouche Street, named after the Archbishop of York, another English military commander. The top floor of the 2-storey block is Douglas Street, named after one of the Scottish commanders. The staff room corridor is called Beaurepaire, the French name for the monastery which then became Bearpark. The Learning Support and Sixth Form corridor is Rokeby Street, named after another English commander. The first floor of the 3-storey block is Mowbray Street, another English commander. The top floor of the 3-storey block is Auld Alliance. That describes the link between the Scots and France, united in attacking England. The single pod venue is Philippa. She was the English queen, much more involved in the battle than Edward. Academic performance The school ranks in the top 100 schools in the United Kingdom.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7003253.stm Top 100 UK schools and is very highly ranked in lists which distinguish clearly between comprehensive and selective schools. GCSE 5 A*-C with English and Maths are usually in the top 3 in the county, A level results are always very high. Johnston achieves the highest results of any state school in the region and has a distinguished track record in getting students from all backgrounds into the most competitive courses. Sutton Trust report 2009 cited it as the only state school in the region reliably to do so year after year. Oxbridge entry is usually between 10‚Äì15 each year. The sixth form and its success is the lasting legacy of the longest-serving and most well-known Head, Dr John Dunford (1983‚Äì1999).

It was released on April 14, 1988 by Extasy Records, topped the Oricon indies chart and reached number 19 on the main chart. Overview Vanishing Vision was released on vinyl record on April 14, 1988 on Yoshiki's own label Extasy Records. Despite being an independent record label, it sold more than ten thousand copies, topping Oricon's indie music chart. But it also reached number 19 on the main Oricon Albums Chart, making them the first indie band to enter the main chart. A limited pressing of five thousand picture discs was also made, that included a separate flexi disc of \\"Stab Me in the Back\\". This version of the song was originally included on the February 1987 Victor Records sampler Skull Thrash Zone Volume I, was recorded with Pata as a support guitar player, and is different from the one that would later appear on their third album Jealousy in 1991. The band toured extensively in support of the record, beginning with Vanishing Tour '88 Spring throughout March and into early April. Vanishing Tour Vol.2 took them to 20 locations for 24 shows from June to July, while the Burn Out Tour '88 Oct. had 12 performances throughout October. A September 4 show at Kyoto Sports Valley, is a popular bootleg recording of the tour, however, only audio of \\"Stab Me in the Back\\" from it was officially released, being included on the 1999 Perfect Best compilation. Vanishing Vision was re-released on CD on October 15, 1989. This was after the release of the band's second album Blue Blood on the major label CBS/Sony. In 1990, with 158,220 copies sold Vanishing Vision was the 78th best-selling album of the year, and stayed on the charts for 47 weeks. By 1997, it had sold over 800,000 copies. A digitally remastered CD version was released on September 13, 2000 by Warner Music Japan. =Composition and analysis= The album's title, Vanishing Vision, was chosen to mean the band was shedding the shameless image they had acquired for a fresh start. Its cover art drawn by Shiro Nishiguchi was inspired by the track \\"Sadistic Desire\\", with input from each band member. Yoshiki said that \\"Vanishing Love,\\" which has roughly half Japanese and half English lyrics, represents human weakness. The other members pointed out that despite being a fast song, the twin guitars and melody are more important. \\"Phantom of Guilt\\" has a 16-beat rhythm with lyrics, according to Toshi, about conflict within the human spirit. \\"Sadistic Desire\\" is a song from hide's previous band Saver Tiger, originally called \\"Sadistic Emotion.\\" Yoshiki rewrote the lyrics about violent sex, inspired by the 1986 film Blue Velvet. Unusually, Taiji played the bass with his fingers for the track and it contains something of a bass solo. An alternate version of the song would later appear on X's 1991 single \\"Silent Jealousy\\". Taiji wrote the 16-beat rhythm, slap bass song \\"Give Me the Pleasure\\" after watching a news report on a murder. The piece is unusual for X in that it uses minor seventh chords and has an ethnic drum beat that also used instruments such as the timbales and cow bell. \\"I'll Kill You\\" is a reworked version of their 1985 debut single. Yoshiki explained that the song is not about killing people as the title would suggest, but is a love song in the vein of a disgruntled married couple. Yoshiki wrote the lyrics to \\"Alive\\" to be about human life and life or death in a dream. The intro contains an excerpt of the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. hide stated that the guitar solos in this song contrast with the others on the album because they are more melodic; \\"a crying guitar.\\" The lyrics for this version of \\"Kurenai\\" are entirely in English, it would later appear mostly in Japanese on Blue Blood and be released as their major debut single, becoming one of their signature songs. While seemingly a love song, Yoshiki stated that \\"Kurenai\\" is actually about the struggle of one's heart. hide revealed that it was his favorite X song before he joined the band and was disappointed that they did not perform it when he did, so he had to nag to get them to play it. Both Toshi and Taiji felt that it has a very Japanese feel to it, with Taiji stressing that each member helped arrange it. Just as its title suggests, \\"Un- finished...\\" is a short incomplete ballad that suddenly cuts off. Yoshiki came up with the song after the album was completed feeling it needed an ending theme. It would also later be reworked and \\"finished\\" for the band's second album.

A Benedictine Roman Catholic school, it accepts and educates pupils of all faiths. History 240px =Foundation= Senior School St Benedict‚Äôs School, Ealing was established following the arrival of Benedictine monks from Downside Abbey into Ealing in 1897 to found the first Benedictine Abbey in London since the Reformation. Under the leadership of Dom Sebastian Cave, Ealing Priory School, as the School was known, (becoming St Benedict's School in 1948) opened on 2 October 1902, with three boys enrolled. The School was founded upon a ¬£5 donation, which was later published in the first issue of the School's Priorian magazine. =Location= The school has occupied various premises at various times in its history, firstly in Blakesley Avenue, then taking rooms in the priory in 1904 before moving across to Orchard Dene (which currently houses the Junior School) in Montpelier Avenue. In 1906 , about a mile from the main school grounds, in Perivale were purchased to provide a sports ground. By the 1920s Orchard Dene was used for boarders and the school was located in two houses on Eaton Rise. A purpose built school building linking these houses was in use by 1936. During the Second World War pupils were evacuated into the now Junior School ‚Äì boarding ceased ‚Äì and the Abbey church was badly damaged by a bomb on 7 October 1940.From the Smallest Beginnings ‚Äì The Story of St Benedict's School Ealing, Nigel Watson, =The Junior School= The Junior School was 'spun off' as a separate entity with its own headmaster, in 1946. The Junior School's first lay headmaster, Dennis McSweeny, was appointed in 2000. The present headmaster, appointed in 2005, is Robert Simmons, himself a former pupil of St Benedict's School. Visits to many places of interest in London, and further afield, extend pupils‚Äô knowledge and understanding of the world around them. In Year 5, pupils visit Normandy and in year 6 they visit the Lake District on a PGL style activity. The school has links with the local and wider community through supporting local and international charities. Concern for the environment is demonstrated, for example by the purchase of a piece of land in Central America which has been planted with trees. Each year on the official feast of St Benedict, a whole school (Junior and Senior) charity day takes place at the end of March to support a charity of the pupils' choosing.Junior School =Nursery= A co- educational Nursery was founded in 2002, in the building on Montpelier Avenue which formerly housed the Middle School. The Governors have approved plans for a three-storey development to replace the existing ‚ÄòArk‚Äô in the Junior School. Work on this is scheduled to start in summer 2016 and, when complete, this new building will house the Pre-Preps and also the Nursery, which will be re- located to the main site. =Move to co-education= Although St Benedict's was founded as a boys' school, girls have been admitted to the Sixth Form of the Senior School since the 1970s and to the nursery since it was founded in 2002. In June 2006 the Monastic Chapter voted to extend co-education across the whole school and since the Michaelmas term of 2007 the Junior School has been fully co-educational. The Senior School became fully co-educational in Michaelmas 2008. As of 2014 girls formed 34% of pupils in the School. =Sex abuse cases= In October 2009, Dom David Pearce, a monk of Ealing Abbey and former headmaster of the Junior School, was jailed for eight years, subsequently reduced to five years, for sexual abuse offences at the school in the period from 1972‚Äì1992 and for one further offence in 2007 after he had ceased to work in the school.'Devil in a dog collar' priest faces jail for sex abuse London Evening Standard ‚Äì 12 August 2009Jailed child pervert priest ruined my life Ealing Gazette, 9 October 2009 In March 2011, Dom Laurence Soper, the Abbot of Ealing Abbey during the 1990s, was arrested on child abuse charges relating to the period when he was a teacher at, and the bursar of, St Benedict's School; it was reported in October 2011 that he had failed to answer bail and was being sought by the police.Father Laurence Soper of Ealing wanted over sex abuse BBC News 14 October 2011 In 2016, he was arrested in Kosovo and extradited to the UK to face trial. In early December 2017, following a 10-week trial at the Old Bailey in central London, Andrew Soper (as he is now known) was found guilty on 19 counts of child sexual abuse including buggery, indecency with a child and indecent assault. He was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. Children suffered severe corporal punishment which was often used as a means to initiate sexual abuse or for sexual gratification. It was claimed that there were daily queues of boys outside the headmaster's study waiting to be caned. A stated that aged 11 he got into trouble in class. The teacher made him kneel in front of the class and continued the whole of the lesson standing on the boy's hands. Jurors at the trial were told about Soper's victims getting sadistic beatings. One survivor said in court, ‚ÄúI have tried countless times to take my own life as I just cannot cope any more.‚ÄùLondon Catholic school abuse survivor speaks of 'constant violence' Following these incidents, and other alleged offences, the Abbot commissioned a report to be prepared by Lord Carlile of Berriew with a view to making recommendations on the school's governance.Carlile Report As a result of the changes made the Independent Schools Inspectorate said in its 2013 inspection report that the pastoral care at St Benedict's was excellent.St Benedict's School 2013 Inspection Report In October 2011 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ordered its own enquiry into the same matters, to be conducted by Bishop John Arnold. In 2016, Peter Allott, deputy head, and former local Conservative Party councillor who had worked at the school since 2004 was jailed for 33 months for possession of child abuse images, as well as possession of a Class A substance. However, it was made clear by the CPS that there was no evidence that Allott had abused his position of trust within the school, and no offensive material was found there. In 2018-2019, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) commissioned by the UK Government was investigating any institutional failures to protect children from sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, and the handling of complaints about Catholic schools and specifically relating to investigations at Ealing Abbey and St Benedict‚Äôs school. The pope‚Äôs representative in Britain, Archbishop Edward Adams, refused to co-operate with the enquiry. The school was described as a \\"grim and beastly place\\" by the Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), and that \\"a culture of cover-up and denial of sexual abuse operated at Ealing Abbey.\\" By October 2019 the IICSA had received 18 further allegations against 8 monks and staff, and believed that the true scale of the abuse is \\"likely to be much higher\\", than those convicted the report found. School life =Governance= Since its foundation members of the monastic community at Ealing Abbey have taught at, and provided pastoral, spiritual and educational leadership, within the School. Until the Senior School's first lay headmaster, Dr A.J. Dachs, was appointed in 1987, all headmasters were monks of the Abbey. Since 1951 the Senior School headmaster has been a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. Following the recommendations of the Carlile report (see above) the School, which had been under the trusteeship of the monks of Ealing since its foundation in 1902, became an independent charity in the form of a company limited by guarantee, independent of the Abbey Trust. New governance arrangements, with a lay chairman, came into effect from September 2012. =Student Representation and the Student Council= Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) recommended the School consider enhancing internal student representation prompting the formation by the School of a School Council with its formal powers outlined in its Constitution. Students may run in elections throughout the School,Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) regulatory compliance inspection report 8-9 December 2015 from the Third Form to the Upper Fifth with two representatives elected from each year. Sixth form students can run for the offices of Student President and Chair of the Sixth-Form Common-Room. The current school council president is Ricardo perrota. The structure of the School Council consists of the Student President and the Student President's Chapter. Members are appointed to the Chapter by the newly elected Student President to represent students in matters regarding: Food and Health, Estates and Buildings, Pastoral and Equality, Finance and Investment, Sixth-Form, Upper and Middle Schools and the Vice President's office. The first codified School Council Constitution was signed in January 2016 by the Student Heads of School, Student President, School Chaplain, Headmaster, Chair of the Sixth-Form Common-Room, Leader of the Upper and Middle School Council and the Chair of the School Governing Body. =Structure= On entry to the Senior School each pupil is assigned to a House: Barlow (partnered with More House in the Junior School); Gervase (partnered with Gregory); Pickering (partnered with Bede) or Roberts (partnered with Fisher). These houses are named after the Benedictine martyrs St Ambrose Barlow, Blessed George Gervase, Blessed Thomas Pickering and St John Roberts. From the Upper Fourth onwards House Captains are appointed in each division, while in the Third Form and Lower Fourth there are House representatives. In addition House Colours are awarded from the Upper Fourth for outstanding contribution to the life of the School. Members of the Upper Sixth may apply to be a prefect, known as \\"Decans\\" or \\"Senior Decans\\". Their roles include helping at parents' evenings and other School events such as concerts, plays and dinners. The Heads of the Decans and Senior Decans are the Student Heads of the School. The School uses this name system for each academic year from age 5 to age 18 (with the equivalent shown in brackets): Junior School * Pre-Prep 1/PP1 (Reception) * Pre-Prep 2/PP2 (Year 1) * Pre- Prep 3/PP3 (Year 2) * Lower Prep (Year 3) * Upper Prep (Year 4) * Form 1 (Year 5) * Form 2 (Year 6) Senior School * Third Form (Year 7) * Lower Fourth (Year 8) * Upper Fourth (Year 9) * Lower Fifth (Year 10) * Upper Fifth (Year 11) * Lower Sixth (Year 12) * Upper Sixth (Year 13) The School year is divided into three terms, Michaelmas term (from early September to mid December), Lent term (from early January to late March) and Trinity term (from late April to early July). =Ethos= The School promotes Catholic Benedictine values through its mission of \\"Teaching a way of living\\", based on The Rule of St Benedict. Registration sessions are accompanied by prayer, in which pupils participate and sometimes lead. Mass is celebrated weekly in the School chapel or in the Ealing Abbey, for those staff and pupils who wish to attend. Retreats organized for each year group give time for reflection and for spiritual growth. Trips are organized, for instance to Rome on a study pilgrimage and to Lourdes, where pupils develop their understanding or are able to express their commitment to service. The Independent Schools Inspectorate noted in its 2013 report that, at all ages, pupils' personal development is excellent. In line with the Benedictine mission, pupils show respect for themselves, for others and for the world around them, in 'learning how to live'. They enjoy relationships with peers and adults alike and their spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is outstanding. =Sport= The main sports for boys are rugby and cricket and for girls are netball and hockey. The school is notably good at fencing, producing national and international fencers. Fencing is a main sport for both boys and girls. The School also offers other sports including dance, tennis, swimming, basketball, athletics and boys' hockey. In rugby the School was runner-up in the NatWest Schools Cup at Under 18 level in 2008; at Under 15 level it was winner in 2005 and runner-up in 1993. The School XV was undefeated in 2008 in 21 of 22 league matches, finishing top of the Canterbury Rankings,and was selected by the Rugby Football Union to represent England in the Sanix World Rugby Youth Invitational Tournament, losing only to the eventual winner. The Under 13 side won the 2012 Junior Champions of the Rosslyn Park National Schools Sevens, the world's largest rugby tournament.Rosslyn Park National Schools Sevens website Accessed 20 June 2013 =Co-curricular activities= In the Senior School there are over 70 clubs and societies. Pupils run a debating society, staff a Combined Cadet Force and participate in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, as well as producing art, music and drama. The Junior School runs a daily programme of after-class hobbies including Mandarin, ballet, chess, cross stitch, fencing, computing and swimming. Both Senior and Junior School pupils contribute to the Priorian, the School magazine.

As a membership-based organization, USA Cycling comprises 2,400 clubs and teams; and nearly 70,000 licensees which include officials, coaches, mechanics, and competitive cyclists of all ages and abilities across all five disciplines of the sport. =Local associations= In effort to grow the sport domestically, USA Cycling supports grass-roots initiatives through its 34 local associations (LA). Each year, USA Cycling reinvests a significant portion of its membership dollars back into these local programs, having distributed $2.5 million since its 2003 inception. =Local and national events= Each year, USA Cycling sanctions over 2,900 events across the U.S. Additionally, the organization administers eight national-level calendars and manages 17 national championship events for all ages and skill levels in several disciplines: road, track, mountain bike, cyclo-cross, BMX and para-cycling. =A decade of growth= USA Cycling has seen steady growth over the last decade as participation in cycling has continued to grow across the nation. The organization's 69,684 licensees in 2010 represent a 63% increase over the 42,724 from 2002. USA Cycling maintains development programs for men and women in all disciplines of competitive cycling, providing a structured pathway to the top tier of the sport. In 2010, 266 individual riders took part in USA Cycling's National Development Program, gaining valuable race experience through 1900 fully supported race days. = Regional and national development camps = Serving as entry points into USA Cycling's National Development Program pathway, the Regional and National Development Camps aim to identify talent and, in some cases, name riders to USA Cycling rosters for major international competitions. =International race camps= USA Cycling takes dozens of juniors on international racing trips each year. These riders gain race experience at the world's top junior events, including Junior Paris-Roubaix and the Tour de L‚ÄôAbitibi. =European resident programs= Nearly 200 American cyclists live and train out of USA Cycling's houses in Belgium, Italy, and Germany each season. This allows them to be fully immersed in European race culture‚Äîa necessary element for advancing to the top tier of professional cycling. =Racing levels= USA Cycling racing levels are called categories, sometimes referred to as \\"cats\\". The lowest category for road, track, and cyclocross racing is 5 for men and women. The lowest category for mountain bike racing is 3 for both sexes. Decreasing categories represent higher ability levels with category 1 being the immediate step below professional level. USA Cycling Rule Book Section 1 p.19,21-30 http://www.usacycling.org/forms/USAC_rulebook-1.pdf Advancement Advancement to higher categories is based on experience, and is shown below. =Road= Upgrading from category 5 to 4 can be done after finishing ten mass start races. Category 4 to 3 can be requested when a certain number of points are earned in races within a 12-month period or race experience, 25 qualifying races with a minimum of 10 top ten finishes with fields of 30 riders or more. 30 points in a 12-month period is an automatic upgrade to category 3. Upgrades from 3 to 2 and 2 to 1 are based on a number of points in a 12-month period. Category 3 to 2 requires 25 points to be eligible and 40 points for an automatic upgrade. =Cyclo-cross= Upgrading in cyclo-cross follows the same upgrade pattern as road but with different points requirements. In this case it is 10 points in a 12-month period to upgrade from category 3 to 2 and 20 points from category 2 to 1. =Track= Upgrading from track category 5 to 4 is done by taking a velodrome safety course or 4 race days, and as with road, is done by points with the added requirement of 5 race days. =Mountain bike= Riders may upgrade to category 2 as fast as they want. After 5 top-5 finishes as a category 3 rider, a rider must upgrade to category 2. After 2 top-5 category 2 finishes, a rider may upgrade to category 1, and after 5 top-5 finishes a rider must upgrade to category 1.

Its position adjacent to the bilateral nuclei of the solitary tract and role as a sensory transducer allow it to integrate blood-to-brain autonomic functions. Such roles of the area postrema include its detection of circulating hormones involved in vomiting, thirst, hunger, and blood pressure control. Structure The area postrema is a paired protuberance found at the inferoposterior limit of the fourth ventricle. Specialized ependymal cells are found within the area postrema. These cells differ slightly from the majority of ependymal cells (ependymocytes), forming a unicellular epithelial lining of the ventricles and central canal. The area postrema is separated from the vagal trigone by the funiculus separans, a thin semitransparent ridge. The vagal trigone overlies the dorsal vagal nucleus and is situated on the caudal end of the rhomboid fossa or 'floor' of the fourth ventricle. The area postrema is situated just before the obex, the inferior apex of the caudal ventricular floor. Both the funiculus separans and area postrema have a similar thick ependyma-containing tanycyte covering. Ependyma and tanycytes can participate in the transport of neurochemicals into and out of the cerebrospinal fluid from its cells or adjacent neurons, glia or vessels. Ependyma and tanycytes may also participate in chemoreception. The area postrema is considered a circumventricular organ because of its proximity to the ventricular system. In a morphological study, area postrema capillaries in the ventral subregion of area postrema were shown to be relatively impermeable like those of the brain, whereas medial and dorsal area postrema capillaries had microscopic characteristics of high permeability, a characteristic called sinusoidal. Subregional capillary density of the area postrema was highest near the ventricular interface, and was nearly twice as dense as the capillary densities of the adjacent solitary nucleus (SN), and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. A tanycyte barrier partially compensates for high capillary permeability in the area postrema. Physiological subregional studies of the area postrema indicated that its blood volume is relatively large, and blood flow and transit time for blood markers relatively slow, thereby amplifying the sensing capability for circulating compounds, such as hormones or transmitters. Micrograph of the area postrema (arrows) in a transverse section through the lower brainstem of a squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). Hematoxylin and eosin stain; Bar=100 microns (0.1 millimeter). =Connections= The area postrema connects to the solitary nucleus, or nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), and other autonomic control centers in the brainstem. It is excited by visceral afferent impulses (sympathetic and vagal) arising from the gastrointestinal tract and other peripheral trigger zones, and by humoral factors. The area postrema makes up part of the dorsal vagal complex, which is the critical termination site of vagal afferent nerve fibers, along with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the NTS. Nausea is most likely induced via stimulation of the area postrema via its connection to the NTS, which may serve as the beginning of the pathway triggering vomiting in response to various emetic inputs. However, this structure plays no key role for nausea induced by the activation of vagal nerve fibers or by motion, and its function in radiation-induced vomiting remains unclear. Because the area postrema and a specialized region of NTS have permeable capillaries, peptides and other hormonal signals in the blood have direct access to neurons of brain areas with vital roles in the autonomic control of the body. As a result, the area postrema is considered a site of integration for various physiological signals in the blood as they enter the central nervous system. Function =Chemoreception= The area postrema, one of the circumventricular organs, detects toxins in the blood and acts as a vomit- inducing center. The area postrema is a critical homeostatic integration center for humoral and neural signals by means of its function as a chemoreceptor trigger zone for vomiting in response to emetic drugs. It is a densely vascularized structure with subregional capillary specializations for high permeability for circulating blood signals, allowing it to detect various chemical messengers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Capillary blood flow appears to be uniquely slow in the area postrema, prolonging the contact time for blood-borne hormones to interact with neuronal receptors involved in regulation of blood pressure, body fluids, and emetic responses. =Autonomic regulation= The fenestrated sinusoidal capillaries of the area postrema and a specialized region of NTS make this particular region of the medulla critical in the autonomic control of various physiological systems, including the cardiovascular system and the systems controlling feeding and metabolism. Angiotensin II causes a dose-dependent increase in arterial blood pressure without producing considerable changes in the heart rate, an effect mediated by the area postrema. Clinical significance =Damage= Damage to the area postrema, caused primarily by lesioning or ablation, prevents the normal functions of the area postrema from taking place. This ablation is usually done surgically and for the purpose of discovering the exact effect of the area postrema on the rest of the body. Since the area postrema acts as an entry point to the brain for information from the sensory neurons of the stomach, intestines, liver, kidneys, heart, and other internal organs, a variety of physiological reflexes rely on the area postrema to transfer information. The area postrema acts to directly monitor the chemical status of the organism. Lesions of the area postrema are sometimes referred to as 'central vagotomy' because they eliminate the brain‚Äôs ability to monitor the physiological status of the body through its vagus nerve.Dictionary of Biological Psychology By Philip Winn (2001) Routledge These lesions thus serve to prevent the detection of poisons and consequently prevent the body‚Äôs natural defenses from kicking in. In one example, experiments done by Bernstein et al. on rats indicated that the area postrema lesions prevented the detection of lithium chloride, which can become toxic at high concentrations. Since the rats could not detect the chemical, they were not able to employ a psychological procedure known as taste aversion conditioning, causing the rat to continuously ingest the lithium-paired saccharin solution. These findings indicate that rats with area postrema lesions do not acquire the normal conditioned taste aversions when lithium chloride is used as the unconditioned stimulus. In addition to simple taste aversions, rats with the area postrema lesions failed to perform other behavioral and physiological responses associated with the introduction of the toxin and present in the control group, such as lying down on their bellies, delayed stomach emptying, and hypothermia. Such experimentation emphasizes the significance of the area postrema not only in the identification of toxic substances in the body but also in the many physical responses to the toxin. =Effect of dopamine= The area postrema also has a significant role in the discussion of Parkinson's disease. Drugs that treat Parkinson's disease using dopamine have a strong effect on the area postrema. These drugs stimulate dopamine transmission and attempt to normalize motor functions affected by Parkinson's. This works because nerve cells, in particular, in the basal ganglia, which has a crucial role in the regulation of movement and is the primary site for the pathology of Parkinson's, use dopamine as their neurotransmitter and are activated by medications that increase the concentrations of the dopamine or work to stimulate the dopamine receptors. Dopamine also manages to stimulate the area postrema, since this part of the brain contains a high density of dopamine receptors. The area postrema is very sensitive to changes in blood toxicity and senses the presence of poisonous or dangerous substances in the blood. As a defense mechanism, the area postrema induces vomiting to prevent further intoxication. The high density of dopamine receptors in the area postrema makes it very sensitive to the dopamine-enhancing drugs. Stimulation of the dopamine receptors in the area postrema activates these vomiting centers of the brain; this is why nausea is one of the most common side-effects of antiparkinsonian drugs.David E. Golan and Armen H. Tashjian \\"Principles of Pharmacology: the Pathophysiologic Basis of Drug Therapy\\" History The area postrema was first named and located in the gross anatomy of the brain by Magnus Gustaf Retzius, a Swedish anatomist, anthropologist and professor of histology. In 1896, he published a two-volume monograph on the gross anatomy of the human brain in which the area postrema was mentioned. In 1975, evidence of neurons in the area postrema of several mammal species was published. Scientists became increasingly interested in the research of vomiting in the 1950s, perhaps in part due to society's heightened awareness of radiation sickness, a condition in which many patients having vomited after radiation exposure died. Studies showed the existence of two areas in the brain related to emesis: one, a chemosensor for vomiting with no coordinating function, located in the fourth ventricle and two, a coordinator of vomiting with no chemosensory function, located in the lateral reticular formation of the medulla oblongata. In 1953, Borison and Wang determined that the chemosensor area acted as a vomiting trigger zone in the brain stem, which they named the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) for emesis. Using cats and dogs as model organisms, they found that the removal of this trigger zone from the brain allowed for the prevention of emesis in the animals directly following injection of certain chemicals into the blood, demonstrating the existence of a relationship between the trigger zone and the act of vomiting. The CTZ was anatomically located in the area postrema of the medulla oblongata. The area postrema had been anatomically identified and named nearly 60 years earlier, but its function had remained unknown until its role in emesis was later confirmed. Current research Research has continued today around the world on the functions of the area postrema. Beyond its role in emesis, as studied intensely by the researchers of the mid-1900s, the activity of the area postrema has been closely linked to other autonomic functions such as regulation of food intake, body fluid homeostasis, and cardiovascular regulation through behavioral studies and electrophysiological studies. In 2007 in Japan, research was performed on the mechanism of excitability of area postrema neurons by extracellular ATP. Voltage clamp whole-cell recording techniques were used on rat brain slices. The results showed that most responses to ATP are excitatory and that they are mediated by particular P2 purinoceptors found in the area postrema. The role of the area postrema in flavor-conditioned aversion and preference was studied in 2001 by researchers at the Brooklyn College at the City University of New York. The experiment tested the effect of area postrema lesions in rats on their ability to learn flavor-conditioned aversion to flavors paired with toxic drug treatments, which indeed showed that lesions of the area postrema leads to impaired flavor aversion learning. A 2009 study followed the development of the area postrema, using a macaque monkey model in an attempt to identify and characterize neurotransmission in this region as well as to resolve outstanding incongruities across research. These scientists found, in culmination, that previous studies suggest noradrenalin and/or dopamine cause CA fluorescence in the area postrema macaque-CA, meaning catecholaminergic or derived from an amine and functioning as a neurotransmitter or hormone or both. The study, however, found evidence of neurotransmitter secretion instead of release in vesicles. Also, their findings concluded GABA is a major neurotransmitter in the area postrema, not glutamate. Ongoing research continues to unravel discrepancies among various rat, cat, and now macaque monkey models of research. =Potential treatments= A 2002 study in Japan tested a drug that may be of use in curbing the emetic response to drugs that increase dopamine concentrations. The study investigated morphine-induced emesis in ferrets, explaining that morphine exposure triggered dopamine release in the medulla oblongata and in the area postrema by activating opiate receptors, which in turn caused vomiting by the ferrets. Yet a pre-treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine, a dopaminergic neurotoxin, significantly reduced the number of emetic episodes in the ferrets following morphine exposure. This neurotoxin reduced levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, and homovanillic acid, a metabolite of dopamine, and is known to destroy noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons. Here, 6-hydroxydopamine was injected directly into the medulla oblongata but not in other parts of the brain. This study shows how the dopaminergic pathway in the medulla oblongata may be manipulated in order to reduce the nauseating side-effects associated with so many dopamine-increasing drugs. =Continuing pathological studies= The area postrema is also indicated in an insulin treatment against type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A particular mechanism, employed by the drug pramlintide, acts mainly on the area postrema and results in decreased glucagon secretion, which in turn slows down gastric emptying and the satiety effect. This targeting of the area postrema allows an improvement of glycaemic control without causing weight gain. Since the drug acts on the area postrema, the doses must be titrated slowly to avoid inducing nausea in the patient. There are also studies still currently underway to determine the effect of ablation of the area postrema on hypertension and cardiovascular function. For example, studies in rats and rabbits indicate that angiotensin II- dependent hypertension is abolished by lesioning of the area postrema. The mechanism for this physiological reaction is still not fully understood, but the area postrema's ability to regulate cardiovascular function presents a very interesting direction for neuroendocrinology.

Description The creek begins on the eastern slopes of the Wasatch Plateau at elevations above . It turns southward near the town of Emery, then southeastward where it crosses under Interstate 70. It then directly enters the western flank of the San Rafael Swell and continuing in southeasterly direction, it passes Hondu Arch and the Tomsich Butte mining area, then begins its spectacular passage through a narrow slot canyon of Coconino Sandstone known as the \\"Chute\\". After merging with Chimney Canyon and passing the Hidden Splendor Mine area, it passes out through the southeastern escarpment of the San Rafael Reef at the end of Muddy Creek Gorge. In its lower reaches it continues southeastward through the Blue Hills badlands near Caineville then cuts through the Jurassic Morrison Formation where dinosaur fossils have been found. Finally, after an estimated length of and a drop of , it meets the Fremont River some miles north of the town of Hanksville where the two form the Dirty Devil River (which then flows south to meet the Colorado River).

One simple scheme to perform this function scatters the bits of a Hamming code ECC word across multiple memory chips, such that the failure of any single memory chip will affect only one ECC bit per word. This allows memory contents to be reconstructed despite the complete failure of one chip. Typical implementations use more advanced codes, such as a BCH code, that can correct multiple bits with less overhead. Chipkill is frequently combined with dynamic bit-steering, so that if a chip fails (or has exceeded a threshold of bit errors), another, spare, memory chip is used to replace the failed chip. The concept is similar to that of RAID, which protects against disk failure, except that now the concept is applied to individual memory chips. The technology was developed by the IBM Corporation in the early and middle 1990s. An important RAS feature, Chipkill technology is deployed primarily on SSDs, mainframes and midrange servers. An equivalent system from Sun Microsystems is called Extended ECC, while equivalent systems from HP are called Advanced ECC and Chipspare. A similar system from Intel, called Lockstep memory, provides double-device data correction (DDDC) functionality.

In a time of corporate ownership of broadcast outlets, it is also one of only three Hudson Valley radio stations that are independently owned - the other two being WTBQ in Warwick and WDST in Woodstock. WHVW broadcasts on 950 kHz with a power of 500 watts daytime and 57 watts nighttime from a tower located off Route 9G in the Town of Hyde Park. Its studios are located at 316 Main Street in Poughkeepsie, New York. History Originally owned by Ubiquitous Corp., WHVW signed on the air on July 4, 1963 as a daytime-only station broadcasting from a tower just north of the Poughkeepsie/Hyde Park line. Launching with a Top 40 format that served the Poughkeepsie area, the station became popular and within a few years was the #1 station in town, with their share of the audience over 50%. In 1966, WHVW- FM signed on at 97.7 MHz. WHVW was sold to Castle Communications Corp in 1975. Despite the fact the Top 40 was still getting good ratings, the new owners made a radical format change to all-news (via NBC's News and Information Service) as WHPN, beginning June 28, 1976,Local Station To Go All News, Poughkeepsie Journal, June 23, 1976, p.15 and continuing the format after NBC folded the service the following year. This move reduced the station's audience considerably and in 1978 the format changed again to adult contemporary with the new call letters of WWWI. Positioning itself as a more musical alternative to WKIP, the station struggled to find an audience as the ownership lost money. In 1982, WWWI's owners filed for bankruptcy and the future of the station was in doubt. While the sale of WJJB (the former WHVW- FM) helped matters, ownership nearly donated WWWI to a Christian group that would later become the genesis of Sound of Life Radio. Instead, the station was sold, the WHVW calls returned, and the station switched to a standards format. For the next decade, WHVW would switch between various oldies and adult standards permutations, often changing its format as a result of a higher-powered, better-funded station coming into competition. WHVW added nighttime service with 57 watts in the mid 1980s. Around the same time, its studios moved to Market Street in Poughkeepsie; in 1989 the station moved back to the original \\"Broadcast House\\" on Route 9G in Hyde Park, NY. More financial problems in 1992 led to WHVW's sale to current owner Joseph-Paul (J. P.) Ferraro, a former pirate radio broadcaster. Noted by some as an eccentric, Ferraro would move the studios back to Poughkeepsie and change the format to something that would share his musical tastes with the community; the eclectic format has attracted media attention (see below) but has struggled to produce much revenue, resulting in the station relying on paid programming. No salaries are paid to any on-air hosts; anyone who can bring advertisers can potentially get on WHVW. Programming WHVW's musical library is one of the most obscure in the United States, being based mostly on pre-1965 music that was originally issued on 78 rpm records; this music rarely gets airplay anywhere except on some low-powered college or community radio stations. Non- music programming on WHVW includes some weekend religious and ethnic programs, a weekly talk show done with the Poughkeepsie Chamber of Commerce, a high school sports program, a weekly program hosted by Poughkeepsie Journal columnist and former WEOK morning host Larry Hughes, and occasional spots from disgraced former county legislator Joel Tyner. The mystique of WHVW's unique format has produced something of a cult following of the station; though not a factor in its own market and not having been rated in many years, WHVW has been profiled by many publications throughout the northeast including a 2001 piece by The New York Times. In July 2013, WHVW began broadcasting two hours of programming per week on shortwave station WBCQ, in Monticello, Maine, which is owned by Ferraro's former pirate radio compatriot Allan Weiner.

On July 23, 2019, Epstein attempted suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (‚ÄúMCC‚Äù) and on August 10, 2019 he committed suicide at the MCC. On August 27, 2019, Berman conducted a public hearing on the government's motion to dismiss the case. Twenty-seven alleged victims, along with the government and defense counsel, participated at the hearing. On August 29, 2019, Berman granted the motion to dismiss. Ortiz v. United States In March 2019, in a case of first impression, Judge Berman denied an inmate's habeas corpus petition to vacate his six-year sentence. The Court held that the New York Penal Law ¬ß 120.05(7), or Second Degree Assault by a Convicted Prisoner, was a \\"crime of violence\\" under the United States Sentencing Guidelines and that Petitioner had waived his right to appeal.

U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission In August 2015, Berman enjoined the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from continuing its securities law administrative proceedings against Barbara Duka, finding that the SEC's administrative law judges had been appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause in the U.S. Constitution.Duka v. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, No. 15 Civ. 357 (RMB) (SN) (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2015) Upon appeal, the injunction was dissolved based upon the Second Circuit's holding in SEC v. Tilton that parties \\"must await a final SEC order before raising their Appointments Clause claim in federal court.\\" On June 21, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States in Lucia v. SEC resolved a \\"circuit split\\" and ruled that the SEC's ALJs are officers of the United States and, as Berman had also concluded, subject to the Appointments Clause. https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-130_4f14.pdf  United States v. Rahimi  In October 2017, Judge Berman presided over the criminal jury trial of Ahmad Khan Rahimi, also known as the \\"Chelsea bomber.\\" Rahimi was convicted of all counts related to the September 2016 bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, in which 31 people were injured.

NFL Players Association Berman presided over New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's case involving a four-game suspension levied against him by the National Football League for Brady's alleged role in the 2015 \\"Deflategate\\" matter. After unsuccessful efforts to bring about a settlement, Berman overturned Brady's suspension in an opinion dated September 3, 2015, finding significant legal deficiencies attending Brady's suspension. These included the NFL's disregard of the rules and penalties regarding handling of footballs once they have left the locker room; denial of the opportunity for Brady to examine one of the two lead NFL investigators; and denial of access to investigative files.https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/bermandecision.pdf. On April 25, 2016, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. In dissent, Chief Judge Robert Katzmann determined that it was improper for the NFL Commissioner to review in arbitration his own decision to suspend Brady.National Football League Management Council v. National Football League Players Ass'n nos. 15‚Äê2801, 15‚Äê2805 (2d Cir. April 25, 2016) In 2017, Berman moderated a discussion called \\"Arbitration in 2017: Where It is Headed.\\" Panel members consisted of some of the attorneys involved in the scandal, plus a couple arbitrators in law. After the panel discussion was complete, Berman was interviewed by a Sports Illustrated reporter to discuss his position on the scandal. In the interview, Berman said that Brady's case \\"should have been decided on the field,\\" and that he was still confident that he had ruled correctly even though it was overturned. In any case, Berman said that, \\"Deflategate was put to rest by that Super Bowl.\\"(61) United States v. Kurniawan Berman presided over two landmark wine cases. One involved Rudy Kurniawan, who was convicted of counterfeiting fine wines in December 2013 following a jury trial, and sentenced to a term of incarceration. Swedenburg v. Kelly The second wine case involved challenges to state liquor laws which prohibited out of state wineries from selling directly to consumers within New York. In November 2002, Berman held that New York's direct ban on such out of state wine sales was unconstitutional, as \\"[t]he New York regime constitutes a cut and dry example of direct discrimination against interstate commerce.\\"Swedenburg v. Kelly, 232 F. Supp. 2d 135, 145 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), aff'd in part, rev'd in part and remanded, 358 F.3d 223 (2d Cir. 2004), rev'd sub nom. Granholm v.

Carey, 88 F. Supp. 2d 142 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)  Johnson v. Johnson  In January 2011, Berman presided over a trial in which a father sought the return of his child from New York to Vicenza, Italy pursuant to the Hague Convention of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

Berman found that the weight of evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming and that the Court should defer to the trial judge and to the jury. United States v. Stewart, 907 F.3d 677, 692‚Äì701 (2d Cir. 2018)  Carpenters Pension Trust Fund of St. Louis v. Barclays PLC  In April 2014, Berman‚Äîsitting by designation on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit‚Äîauthored the panel's opinion reinstating a securities fraud class action brought by pension funds against Barclays PLC and former Barclays' CEO Robert Diamond. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants had knowingly submitted false and inaccurate information to establish LIBOR rates during the class period of August 2007 through January 2009. The Court adopted a principle (also embraced by the Eleventh Circuit) that \\"so long as the falsehood remains uncorrected, it will continue to taint the total mix of available public information, and the market will continue to attribute the artificial inflation to the stock, day after day.\\"Carpenters Pension Trust Fund of St. Louis v.

Books-A-Million  In August 2014, Berman‚Äîsitting by designation on a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit‚Äîheard the appeal of an employee who had been terminated from her job. The Court of Appeals held that the district court correctly awarded summary judgment to plaintiff on her COBRA claims and to Books-A-Million with respect to plaintiff's Title VII and Equal Pay Act claims, but erred in dismissing plaintiff's FMLA claims. The Court of Appeals found that \\"[i]if a trial court refuses to grant further legal or equitable relief to a plaintiff who insists that such relief is necessary to make the plaintiff whole, it must articulate its rationale.\\"  Rodriguez v. Schriver  In November 2004, Berman‚Äîsitting by designation on a panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals‚Äîheard New York State's appeal of a magistrate judge's decision, which found that prosecutors had improperly excluded a juror for non-race neutral reasons in a criminal trial. In vacating the judgment of the magistrate, the Second Circuit held that the basis for the juror's exclusion was not inherently discriminatory, and that the prosecutor had offered race neutral reasons.  New England Insurance Co. v. Healthcare Underwriters Mutual Insurance Co.  In July 2002, Berman‚Äîsitting by designation on a panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals‚Äîheard the appeal of New England Insurance Company, following the district court's reversal of a jury verdict finding in New England Insurance's favor. The Second Circuit reinstated the jury verdict. \\"We necessarily disagree with the 'clear liability' language []introduced by the district court in deciding Healthcare's post-trial application for judgment as a matter of law. As noted, 'clear liability' was specifically rejected and abandoned [and] there is no case since Pavia in which a court held that a finding of clear liability was given conclusive or totally dispositive weight.\\"New England Insurance Co. v. Healthcare Underwriters Mutual Insurance Co., 295 F.3d 232, 242-43 (2d Cir. 2002)  Publications and teaching  Berman has authored a number of articles about children, including A Team Model To Identify Child Abuse, Seven Steps To Protect Children, Community Service for Juvenile Offenders, and Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Published in the New York Law Journal, these articles offer guidance in developing improved models for identifying child abuse, bolstering the child welfare system, implementing community service-based sentencing options for juvenile offenders, and improving the process for obtaining special immigrant juvenile status.

When an earthquake occurs, seismic waves radiate out spherically from the earthquake's focus. The primary seismic waves are refracted by the liquid outer core of the Earth and are not detected between 104¬∞ and 140¬∞ (between approximately ) from the epicenter. The secondary seismic waves cannot pass through the liquid outer core and are not detected more than 104¬∞ (approximately ) from the epicenter. P-waves that have been converted to S-waves on leaving the outer core may be detected beyond 140 degrees. The reason for this is that the velocity for P-waves and S-waves is governed by both the different properties in the material which they travel through and the different mathematical relationships they share in each case. The three properties are: incompressibility (k), density (p) and rigidity (u). P-wave velocity is equal to \\\\sqrt{(k+\\\\tfrac{4}{3}u)/p} whereas S-wave velocity is equal to \\\\sqrt{(u/p)} and so S-wave velocity is entirely dependent on the rigidity of the material it travels through. Liquids, however, have zero rigidity, hence always making the S-wave velocity overall zero and as such S-waves lose all velocity when travelling through a liquid. P-waves, however, are only partially dependent on rigidity and as such still maintain some velocity (if greatly reduced) when travelling through a liquid. Analysis of the seismology of various recorded earthquakes and their shadow zones led geologist Richard Oldham to deduce in 1906 the liquid nature of the Earth's outer core.

Born in North Carolina, he studied and worked in New York City, then moved to Chicago for much of his career. He established his own public relations company in Chicago and wrote speeches for candidates and presidents including Thomas Dewey, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Biography Owen was born in Warrenton, North Carolina, in 1889. He graduated from Virginia Union University in 1913. Later, while studying economics at Columbia University in 1916, he joined the Socialist Party of America.Adams, Luther, \\"Owen, Chandler (1889-1967)\\", BlackPast.org. He began a lifelong friendship with A. Philip Randolph and together they followed the lead of radical activist Hubert Harrison. They soon became known in Harlem as \\"Lenin\\" (Owen) and \\"Trotsky\\" (Randolph). The two started a journal in 1917, called The Messenger, which published leading literary and political writers. Soon after, while Owen was running for the New York State Assembly, he and Randolph were jailed, where they were mocked and treated cruelly for their Socialist affiliations. Owen moved to Chicago, Illinois, shortly thereafter and found himself quickly enlightened with socialistic views. He became managing editor of the Chicago Bee, a major African-American publication, and continued to back Randolph in his efforts to unionize Pullman porters on the railroads. With his mounting career success, Owen went on to establish his own public relations company. He remained interested in politics and wrote many speeches for politicians such as Wendell Willkie, Thomas Dewey, and even for US presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. In the 1920s, Owen became a Republican. He would later run unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. For the remainder of his life, he worked in public relations and continue to write speeches. Suffering from terminal kidney disease, Owen wrote a last letter to Philip Randolph saying, \\"Our long friendship, never soiled, is nearing its close. I've been in pain. If you were not living, I would commit suicide today.\\" Owen died soon after in November 1967. Like Harrison, Owen was an atheist. In a 1919 issue of The Messenger he and Randolph wrote, \\"We don't thank God for anything...our Deity is the toiling masses of the world and the things for which we thank are their achievement.\\"Chandler Owen: Progressive-Era editor, writer, and labor activist , African Americans for Humanism.

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 5 October 1989. Blackadder faces a court- martial for shooting a carrier pigeon. Plot Captain Blackadder receives numerous calls to the wrong number before finally having a call with orders to advance. He avoids going over the top by pretending the line is breaking up. He then throws away a telegram ordering him to advance on the grounds that it is wrongly addressed to \\"Catpain Blackudder\\" and then shoots a carrier pigeon relaying the same message. Upon inspection of the pigeon's partly charred message, however, it turns out that shooting carrier pigeons has become an offence punishable by court-martial, and Blackadder simply decides to destroy the evidence by cooking and eating the pigeon for his lunch. When General Melchett arrives at the trenches, demanding an explanation as to why the group hasn't advanced, Blackadder nearly gets away with it by blaming the communication breakdown. Unfortunately Private Baldrick and Lieutenant George unintentionally reveal what Blackadder has done (as having been told not to answer any questions on the incident, when asked unrelated questions, they reply, \\"We didn't get any messages, and Captain Blackadder definitely did not shoot that delicious plump-breasted pigeon.\\"). Finally, there are pigeon feathers on the floor, which Captain Darling and Melchett believe to be white. But after Baldrick points out that the feathers are \\"speckly,\\" Melchett is enraged, as it was his beloved pet pigeon Speckled Jim, and tries to strike Blackadder, forcing Darling to physically restrain Melchett. Smugly, Darling then informs Blackadder that he's under arrest and, if found guilty at court- martial, he will face execution by firing squad. Blackadder sends for Sir Bob Massingbird (originally scripted as \\"Robert Moxon Browne\\", a real-life lawyer and friend of Rowan Atkinson's, until this was judged to be technically advertising), a brilliant lawyer sure to get him acquitted (Massingbird's previous cases included convincing a jury that a man who had a bloody knife in front of a dead man, who was seen stabbing the man in front of 13 people and said \\"I'm glad I killed the bastard\\" was innocent, and that Oscar Wilde was a homosexual despite incredible notoriety as a womanizer). However, the letters are mixed up thanks to Baldrick, and George turns up as Blackadder's defence. On the day of the court-martial, Blackadder is relieved to know that Darling is the prosecuting counsel ‚Äì but is mortified to learn that Melchett is the judge. Melchett summarily fines George ¬£50 for wasting the court's time by turning up, takes great pains to locate his black cap, and refers to Blackadder as \\"the Flanders Pigeon Murderer\\". George puts paid to any remaining hopes with his poor choice of witnesses: Darling, who provides more evidence against Blackadder, and Baldrick, who takes Blackadder's order to deny everything literally and denies everything, even his name. Darling's case for the prosecution involves calling Melchett to the witness stand and inciting him against Blackadder, after which Melchett sentences Blackadder to death by firing squad without consulting the jury. Back in his cell Blackadder receives an escape kit from Baldrick that fully caters for unexpected situations but lacks the essential tools to actually attempt an escape, and a visit from his friendly firing squad, with whom he trades vicious banter. Another mix-up results in Baldrick delivering a telegram for George's mother to Blackadder, but this provides Blackadder with a way out, when he discovers that George's mad uncle Rupert has just been made Minister of War, and can get Blackadder acquitted. When Baldrick eventually remembers to tell George this after confusion as to which person in the letter can help Blackadder, they decide to celebrate by drinking some Scotch that George's mother sent him ‚Äì and get so drunk that they pass out before remembering to send a telegram. Blackadder turns up to the execution grounds optimistic, but gets worried when he hears a telegram has not arrived. A telegram arrives and the jailor stops the squad just after the Corporal says 'Aim!' It turns out to be from one of the firing squad saying 'Here's looking at you, love from all the boys in the firing squad.' The Squad then begin again. In the end, though, Rupert sends a telegram anyway after reading about Blackadder's case in the register, believing that Melchett made a mistake and knowing that Blackadder is a close friend of his nephew's. However, Blackadder reads another of George's telegrams and discovers that they did not send it themselves. Out of revenge, Blackadder volunteers Baldrick and George for the mission that Captain Darling calls him about ‚Äì 'Operation Certain-Death', a mission into No-Man's Land.

Towards the Sea exists in three separate versions: * The first, composed in 1981 for alto flute and guitar * The second, also composed in 1981, is for alto flute, harp and string orchestra * The third, written in 1989, is for alto flute and harp without orchestra. Each version lasts around 11 minutes. The work is divided into three sections--The Night, Moby-Dick, and Cape Cod. These titles are in reference to Melville's novel Moby Dick, or The Whale. The composer wished to emphasise the spiritual dimension of the book, quoting the passage, \\"meditation and water are wedded together\\". He also said that, \\"The music is a homage to the sea which creates all things and a sketch for the sea of tonality\\"; Toward the Sea was written at a time when Takemitsu was increasingly returning to tonality after a period of experimental composition. Most of the work is written in free time, with no bar lines (except in the second version, to facilitate conducting). In each version, the flute has the primary melodic line, based in part on a motif spelling \\"sea\\" in German musical notation: E‚ÄìE‚ÄìA. This motif reappeared in several of Takemitsu's later works. References *Burton, Anthony (2000). Notes to I Hear the Water Dreaming Deutsche Grammophon 453 459-2. *Leathwood, Jonathan.

Its anterior wall, formed by the back of the pons and the medulla oblongata, constitutes the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is covered by a thin layer of grey matter continuous with that of the spinal cord; superficial to this is a thin lamina of neuroglia which constitutes the ependyma of the ventricle and supports a layer of ciliated epithelium. Parts The fossa consists of three parts, superior, intermediate, and inferior: ;The superior part :The superior part is triangular in shape and limited laterally by the superior cerebellar peduncle; its apex, directed upward, is continuous with the cerebral aqueduct; its base is represented by an imaginary line at the level of the upper ends of the superior foveae. ;The intermediate part :The intermediate part extends from this level to that of the horizontal portions of the taeniae of the ventricle; it is narrow above where it is limited laterally by the middle peduncle, but widens below and is prolonged into the lateral recesses of the ventricle. ; The inferior part :The inferior part is triangular, and its downwardly directed apex, named the calamus scriptorius (as is shaped like a writing quill-nib) is continuous with the central canal of the closed part of the medulla oblongata. The sulcus limitans forms the lateral boundary of the medial eminence. Features In the superior part of the rhomboid fossa it corresponds with the lateral limit of the fossa and presents a bluish-gray area, the locus coeruleus, which owes its color to an underlying patch of deeply pigmented nerve cells, termed the substantia ferruginea. At the level of the facial colliculus the sulcus limitans widens into a flattened depression, the superior fovea, and in the inferior part of the fossa appears as a distinct dimple, the inferior fovea. Lateral to the fove√¶ is a rounded elevation named the area acustica, which extends into the lateral recess and there forms a feebly marked swelling, the tuberculum acusticum. Winding around the inferior peduncle and crossing the area acustica and the medial eminence are a number of white strands, the stri√¶ medullares, which form a portion of the cochlear division of the acoustic nerve and disappear into the median sulcus. Below the inferior fovea, and between the hypoglossal trigone and the lower part of the area acustica is a triangular dark field, the vagal trigone, which corresponds to the sensory nucleus of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. The lower end of the vagal trigone is crossed by a narrow translucent ridge, the funiculus separans, and between this funiculus and the gracile nucleus, is a small tongue-shaped area, the area postrema. On section it is seen that the funiculus separans is formed by a strip of thickened ependyma, and the area postrema by loose, highly vascular, neuroglial tissue containing nerve cells of moderate size.

It was established in 1981, is based in West Yorkshire, and has over 10,000 open accounts. The Ecology is a member of the Building Societies Association. The purpose of the Society is to achieve the greatest degree of environmental sustainability. It lends money to create and maintain sustainable housing stock, preferably with sustainable communities and green enterprise. Its funding is secured with the least degree of environmental degradation possible, and with the greatest degree of stakeholder endorsement obtainable. History and purpose The initial vision was to set up a building society that specialised in properties that conveyed an ecological benefit in terms of construction, use of land or lifestyle. The idea was sparked at a Green Party Conference, following the experience of a Yorkshire solicitor, David Pedley, who had great difficulty in finding anyone willing to give him a mortgage on a property needing extensive renovation. Ecology was founded by ten initial supporters who each invested ¬£500, raising the ¬£5000 capital which was the minimum required to start a building society at that time. Between 1981 and 1993 it was the smallest building society in the UK. By 2016 the society's mortgage lending had risen to ¬£30.7 million\\"Ecology Building Society Annual Review 2016\\". Ecology Building Society. and its savings balances to ¬£163.1 million. The primary purpose of the Society is to achieve the greatest degree of environmental sustainability by the application of its financial strength as can be achieved concomitant with the legal framework that the Society is subject to. This is achieved by lending activity primarily to foster the creation and maintenance of a sustainable housing stock, where possible in the context of sustainable communities, but also to support green enterprise, with this lending programme fed by funding secured with the least degree of environmental degradation possible, and with the greatest degree of stakeholder endorsement obtainable. Ecology Building Society were the first building society awarded the Fair Tax Mark,\\"Ecology Building Society - Fair Tax Mark\\". Fair Tax Mark. Accessed 1 October 2017 in 2016. Memorandum of the Society This primary purpose is anchored in the Memorandum of the Society which contains a requirement \\"to promote‚Ä¶ecological policies designed to promote or enhance the environment in accordance with the principles of sustainable development\\". Sustainable development is defined as \\"Improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems\\". Products Ecology offers a range of mortgage products and lends throughout the UK. It specialises in renovation and new build mortgages on properties and projects that respect the environment. Where possible, mortgage pricing is aligned with the project's positive environmental impacts, in particular energy and carbon reduction, through its series of C-Change mortgage discounts. Ecology is particularly interested to see derelict and dilapidated property brought back into use. The Society supports the widespread application of Passivhaus building principles in the UK. Ecology also offers a range of savings accounts including instant access accounts, a notice account and an Individual Savings Account (ISA), which allow individuals to fund the society's ecological lending programme. Mortgage and savings accounts can be managed online via the Ecology's website or by post.

Determining such cost may require allocations where multiple assets are acquired together. Tax basis may be reduced by allowances for depreciation. Such reduced basis is referred to as the adjusted tax basis. Adjusted tax basis is used in determining gain or loss from disposition of the asset. Tax basis may be relevant in other tax computations.For a summary of United States rules, see IRS Publication 551. Tax basis of a member's interest in a partnership and other flow-through entity is generally increased by the members share of income and reduced by the share of loss. The tax basis of property acquired by gift is generally the basis of the person making the gift. Tax basis in property received from corporations or partnerships may be the corporation's or partnership's basis in some cases. Determining tax basis The basis of property is generally the property's cost: the amount paid for the property in cash or other property.See . Holding period refers to the duration of time owned based on the purchase date.For a discussion of U.S. rules, see Willis, Eugene and Hoffman, William H. Jr., et al, South-Western Federal Taxation annual edition, Chapter 13. or for 2009. Also see Pratt, James W., Kulsrud, William N., et al, Federal Taxation\\", updated periodically, Chapter 14. 2010 edition . Where an asset is purchased, tax basis generally includes cash paid plus liabilities assumed. For example, if Joe acquires a building for $10,000 cash and assumes a mortgage for $80,000 (which is his liability assumed), Joe's basis in the building is $90,000. If multiple items of property are acquired together in a single transaction, the tax basis must generally be allocated to the items in proportion to their values at the time of acquisition.26 CFR 1.61-6(a). Fungible property (e.g., bushels of wheat or shares of corporation stock) may include items of property acquired at different times with differing bases. If such property is sold, the taxpayer may need to use an assumption (such as average cost or FIFO) for determining the cost of the portion of the property sold. Adjustments to basis The tax basis of an asset subject to cost recovery must be reduced by deductions allowed for such cost recovery.26 USC 1016. For example, if Joe claimed $25,000 of depreciation deductions on his building, his adjusted basis would be the $90,000 as above less $25,000, or $65,000. Cost recovery deductions may include depreciation, amortization, and deducted losses or declines in value. Some jurisdictions (e.g., Germany) allow a deduction for decline in value of certain assets, which reduces tax basis. Partner's basis in partnership A partner's tax basis in the partnership generally equals the adjusted basis of property contributed or cash paid plus any income recognized by the partner on the formation of the partnership, plus the partner's share of the liabilities of the partnership under . Such income may arise from services performed in exchange for the partnership interest. The member's basis is adjusted each year for his share of the entity's income or loss. Generally, the adjustment cannot reduce tax basis below zero. The member's basis is also reduced for distributions, and increased by the member's share of partnership income. Under United States rules,See U.S. IRS Publication 541 for a list of adjustments. a partner's tax basis is increased to the extent the partner's share of the liabilities of the partnership increases. The partner's tax basis is decreased to the extent the partner's share of partnership liabilities is considered to have decreased. For example, if Ann is a general partner of ABC partnership, Ann's tax basis in the partnership may be increased if the partnership borrows money. Special allocation rules for debt vary, depending on whether the debt is considered to be recourse or non-recourse to the partners in a partnership. Basis of gifts and inheritances Tax basis of property received by a U.S. person by gift is the donor's tax basis of the property. If the fair market value of the property exceeded this tax basis and the donor paid gift tax, the tax basis is increased by the gift tax. This adjustment applies only if the recipient sells the property at a gain.26 USC 1015. Tax basis of property acquired by inheritance (i.e., from a decedent) is the fair market value at the date of death. However, certain alternative basis amounts may be used at the election of the estate of the decedent.26 USC 1014. Property so acquired is treated as if acquired by gift, but the basis is limited to fair market value.26 USC 1022. Carryover and substituted basis Property acquired in a non-taxable exchange takes the basis of the property exchanged.26 USC 1031-1045, 25 USC 358, 26 USC 362. Examples of non-taxable exchanges include like kind exchanges, partnership liquidations, and corporate reorganizations. Property acquired by distribution from a corporation or partnership may retain the same tax basis to the member as the entity's tax basis in certain circumstances. This basis is increased by any gain the member must recognize on the distribution.26 USC 334, 26 USC 732. Other issues Tax basis may be further adjusted for certain computations relating to controlled foreign corporations in the U.S.26 USC 961. See also *Partnership *Capital gain *Cost basis References Tax terms ","title":"Tax basis"},{"id":"5036061","text":"Basis (or cost basis), as used in United States tax law, is the original cost of property, adjusted for factors such as depreciation. When property is sold, the taxpayer pays/(saves) taxes on a capital gain/(loss) that equals the amount realized on the sale minus the sold property's basis. Cost basis is needed because tax is due based on the gain in value of an asset. For example, if a person buys a rock for $20, and sells the same rock for $20, there is no tax, since there is no profit. If, however, that person buys a rock for $20 and then sells the same rock for $25, then there is a capital gain on the rock of $5, which is thus taxable. The purchase price of $20 is analogous to cost of sales. Typically, capital gains tax is due only when an asset is sold. However the rules for this are very complicated. If tax is paid because the value has increased, the new value will be the cost basis for any future tax. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 551 contains the IRS's definition of basis: \\"Basis is the amount of your investment in property for tax purposes. Use the basis of property to figure depreciation, amortization, depletion, and casualty losses. Also use it to figure gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of property.\\" Determining basis For federal income taxation purposes, determining basis depends on how the asset in question was acquired. Assets acquired by purchase or contract: For assets purchased or acquired contractually, the basis equals the purchase price. See IRC (Internal Revenue Code) ¬ß 1012. Assets acquired by gift or trust: The general rule is that assets acquired by gift or trust receive transferred basis (also called carryover basis). See IRC ¬ß 1015. Put simply, gifted assets retain the donor's basis. This means that the value of the asset at the time of transfer is irrelevant to computing the donee's new basis. The general rule does not apply, however, if at the time of transfer the donor's adjusted basis in the property exceeds its fair market value and the recipient disposes of the property at a loss. In this situation the asset's basis is its fair market value at the time of transfer. See Treas. Reg. ¬ß 1.1015-1(a)(1). Assets acquired by inheritance: Assets acquired by inheritance are eligible to receive stepped-up basis, meaning the fair market value of the asset at the time of the decedent's death. See IRC ¬ß 1014. This provision shields the appreciation in value of the asset during the life of the decedent from any income taxation whatsoever. Adjusted basis: An asset's basis can increase or decrease depending on changes that occur throughout its lifetime. For this reason, IRC ¬ß 1001(a) provides that computing gain requires determining the amount realized from the sale or disposition of property minus the adjusted basis. Capital improvements (such as adding a deck to your house) increase the asset's basis while depreciation deductions (statutory deductions that reduce the taxpayer's taxable income for a given year) diminish the asset's basis. Another way of viewing adjusted basis is to think of the asset as a savings account, with capital improvements representing deposits and depreciation deductions representing withdrawals. Mutual Fund Basis Methods For mutual funds, there are 4 basis methods approved by the IRS, detailed in Publication 564: Cost basis methods: * Specific share identification * First-in, first-out (FIFO) Average basis methods: * Average cost single category (ACSC) * Average cost double category (ACDC) Starting in Jan 2012, broker/dealers are required to track cost basis on covered shares (shares purchased on or after 1 Jan 2012) and are required by law to offer at least the following 3 basis methods: * Specific share identification (Spec ID) * First-in, first-out (FIFO) * Average cost single category The following other methods are now available to be used as well: * Highest-in, first-out (HIFO) * Min Tax * Max Gain Reporting Cost Basis Reporting is a term used in the financial services industry that refers to identifying the actual cost of a security for income tax purposes. Cost basis reporting became mandatory on January 1, 2011. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ‚Äì popularly known as the ‚Äúbailout bill‚Äù ‚Äì was signed into law on October 3, 2008 to address the mounting global financial crisis.\\"Bush signs financial bailout package\\", Reuters, October 3, 2008, accessed April 14, 2011 The Act also had important cost basis ramifications, because Section 403 contained provisions that place significant cost basis-related requirements on brokers and other intermediaries who report their clients‚Äô adjusted cost basis on IRS Form 1099.Kearney, Helen \\"Advisers must gear up for cost-basis angst\\", Reuters, September 30, 2010, accessed April 14, 2011 Under the new legislation, financial intermediaries must report accurate adjusted cost basis information to both investors and the IRS for: * Equities acquired on or after January 1, 2011 * Mutual fund and dividend reinvestment plan (DRiP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012. * Financial instruments such as debt securities, options and private placements acquired on or after January 1, 2014 Additionally, an intermediary who transfers a client account to another intermediary must provide information necessary for cost basis reporting within 15 days of the account transfer. Financial intermediaries need to develop a compliance plan now, since penalties for non-compliance are stiff ‚Äì up to $350,000 per year for incorrect Form 1099-B cost basis reporting,\\"Complying with new cost basis legislation: What brokers, banks, transfer agents, mutual funds and issuers need to know\\" , DTCC (The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation), page 15 (section titled Penalties for Inaccurate Reporting), December 2008, accessed April 15, 2011, page not found March 8, 2017. and unlimited penalties for intentional disregard of the new requirements. Under the new law, taxpayers are also subject to penalties of up to $1,000 for underreporting capital gains taxes, and up to $5,000 for willful disregard of the law or reckless conduct in reporting capital gains taxes. Note that these examples highlight selected aspects of the new legislation, and are not meant to provide a complete view of the compliance issues facing any specific organization. Evaluation of methods Specific share identification is the most record and labor- intensive, as one must track all purchases and sales and specify which share was sold on which date. It almost always allows the lowest tax bill, however, as one has discretion on which gains to realize. Starting in 2012, the shares being sold must be identified at the time of the sale. FIFO is the default method used for brokerage securities if no other is specified, and generally results in the highest tax bill, as it sells oldest (hence generally most appreciated) shares first. Average cost single category is widely used by mutual funds, as it is the simplest in terms of record keeping (only total basis need be tracked) and sale (no specifying required), and results in moderate tax. HIFO sells the shares with the highest cost first in an attempt to minimize the tax bill. Min Tax sells shares in the following order: shares with short-term losses, long-term losses, long-term gains and lastly short- term gains. Max Gain is the exact opposite of Min Tax. 2012 legislation changes Shareholders are no longer required to petition the IRS to switch cost basis methods starting in 2012, however to move into or out of average cost, the shareholder must do so in writing. The IRS considers in writing to be letters from the shareholder to their financial institution, changing methods online, or filling out a method election/change form from their financial institution. The IRS does not currently consider verbal permission on a recorded line as being \\"in writing.\\" Transfer agents and broker/dealers are now required by law to report the gains or losses of any sales of covered shares to the IRS. Institutions transferring covered shares to another institution must transfer the basis for those shares within 15 days of transfer. Because FIFO and Spec ID require a complete lot history, institutions must transfer and track full lot history and cannot transfer a \\"rolled up\\" total cost when transferring the cost basis to another institution. Several financial institutions will be participating in a Cost Basis Reporting System or CBRS to ease the transfer of cost basis between institutions but are not required by the IRS to do so.

It has the distinction of being one of the first dedicated jet-powered training aircraft to be produced in the world.\\"Fokker S.14.\\" letletlet- warplanes.com, Retrieved: 15 September 2019. Development started in the late 1940s at the behest of British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, who were seeking out a manufacturer to produce a new trainer aircraft powered by their Derwent turbojet engine. Fokker decided to design such an aircraft, designating it the S.14 Machtrainer. On 19 May 1951, the first prototype performed the type's maiden flight. Having secured an order from the Royal Netherlands Air Force for 20 aircraft, the Machtrainer entered service with the service during 1955. It would be operated by the service until the last examples were retired in 1967. Fokker initially had high sales hopes for the Machtrainer on the global trainer market, which included its manufacture under license overseas. American aircraft manufacturer Fairchild was interested in producing the Machtrainer for the United States Air Force, but failed to secure any orders itself. Brazil also negotiated for the local manufacture of 50 Rolls-Royce Nene-powered Machtrainers, but political changes derailed this effort as well. Various countries studied its adoption, however, the Machtrainer would ultimately not be adopted by any organisation other than the Royal Netherlands Air Force. Development =Origins= Machtrainer L-11 on static display in a museum, June 2007 Following the end of the Second World War, the nations of Europe began to recover and rebuild their national industries, Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker was no exception. While initial activities revolved around the refurbishment and building of foreign-designed aircraft, such as the Hawker Sea Fury and Gloster Meteor, figures within the Dutch government and Fokker itself were keen to resume its own indigenous design activities as well. In particular, there was considerable interest in Fokker developing aircraft that would harness the newly-available field of jet propulsion. Likely having recognised that the increasing prevalence of jet- powered fighters would soon lead to existing piston-engined advanced trainers not possessing comparable performance,Flight 24 November 1949, p. 688. during the late 1940s, Fokker commenced work on designing their own jet-engined advanced trainer, designated S.14 Machtrainer. In 1949, aviation periodical Flight International observed the company's specification to have been \\"unique... a turbojet-powered advanced trainer, offering side-by-side seating of pupil and instructor, simplicity in maintenance and construction and an adequate all-round performance\\".Flight 24 November 1949, p. 687. According to aviation author Roland W. Harker, the notion of producing a Dutch jet trainer had originated from a speculative approach by British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce to Fokker with drawings for a Derwent-powered jet trainer. Allegedly, Rolls-Royce had feared losing out on engine sales upon the large and lucrative market for jet trainers, particularly to the Goblin-powered de Havilland Vampire; the company had previously been rebuffed after attempting to raise interest with British manufacturer Miles Aircraft in producing a Derwent-powered competitor, and thus decided to approach Fokker.Harker 1976, p. 96. =Into flight= On 19 May 1951, the first prototype, registered PH- NDY, conducted its maiden flight; it was powered by a single Derwent V engine. However, it received considerable damage later that day as a result of the undercarriage having failed to extend during its second flight. The prototype was fully repaired and was subsequently displayed at the Paris Air Show later that year.Uijthoven 2003, pp. 53‚Äì54.Donald 1997, p. 439. While the prototype and the production aircraft the followed it were largely similar, the portions of the airframe were strengthened to cope with greater G-forces.Smith Flight 15 January 1954, p. 71. The Royal Netherlands Air Force placed an order for 20 S.14s equipped with the more powerful Rolls-Royce Derwent 8 engine. At one point, Fokker held great hopes for the Machtrainer's export prospects; the company held negotiations with Brazil on the topic of manufacturing 50 Rolls- Royce Nene-powered Machtrainers under licence.Uijthoven 2003, p. 56. In addition, the American aircraft manufacturer Fairchild, which later also built the Fokker Friendship under license, sought to secure an order for the Machtrainer from the United States Air Force. To support the company's sales efforts, the first prototype was reengined with the Nene III powerplant, which was capable of generating up to 5,100 lb (22.7 kN); it first flew in this configuration on 25 October 1953.Smith Flight 15 January 1954, p. 68. Flight testing found that the increased power of the Nene III enabled the Machtrainer to attain a higher maximum speed of 831 km.h (516 mph). However, the Brazilian initiative ultimately came to nought, interest having evaporated following a change of government in Brazil. Fairchild also chose to abandon its production plans for the type. Although several other countries also tested the aircraft, orders did not materialize.Uijthoven 2003, pp. 56‚Äì57. Compared to other dedicated jet trainer designs of the same period such as the Fouga Magister, the Machtrainer possessed higher operational costs. Design Close-up view of a preserved Machtrainer. Note the nose air inlet for feeding air to the engine The S.14 Machtrainer was a low-winged monoplane. Featuring all-metal construction, aside from the engine compartment, it is almost exclusively composed of lightweight alloys. To accommodate a sizable cockpit, it possessed a fairly wide fuselage. The design and size of the wing reportedly allowed for the aircraft to land at much lower speeds than contemporary jet aircraft of the era. Furthermore, a total of three pneumatically-actuated door-type air brakes were fitted to the rear fuselage.Uijthoven 2003, pp. 52‚Äì53. It was also provisioned with a retractable tricycle undercarriage, which was also pneumatically-operated; the main wheels were fitted with Dowty-built shock absorbers. The main assemblies of the undercarriage retracted inwards into the wing's center section, while the nosewheel retracted forwards into a recess within the nose's underside.Flight 24 November 1949, pp. 687‚Äì688. In order to better facilitate its use as a trainer, the crew of two were seated in a side- by-side arrangement within a relatively spacious cockpit. There was actually sufficient room as to allow for a third crew member to be present, although this capability would necessitate the deletion of the radio or radar equipment that could otherwise be installed in this location. Primary controls, such as the throttle and air brakes, are duplicated; many of the controls are positioned on a central pedestal. Both crew were provided with Martin-Baker- built ejection seats.Smith Flight 15 January 1954, p. 69. The slide hood of the canopy is jettisonable and operated electrically. The majority of the aircraft's electrical systems are installed directly beneath the cockpit and were accessible via multiple inspection panels; consumables such as batteries and oxygen canisters were also housed nearby. The S.14 was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Derwent engine, which was accommodated within the centre of the fuselage, directly above the low-mounted wing and surrounded by steel walls, being separated from the cockpit by a fireproof bulkhead. Air was supplied to the engine via two ducts that both diverged sharply from a central circular inlet present in the nose of the aircraft. A lengthy jetpipe, carried upon trunnions, is also used; it could be released and readily moved for maintenance inspections. Fuel tanks was housed within the central and outer sections of the wing; electrical booster pumps transferred fuel between the engine and the inner tanks, while air pressure alone was sufficient to move fuel from the outer tanks. The wing's centre sections were individually bolted on the lower fuselage; the wing itself was tapered, covered in alclad, and featured split-flaps along the centre of its trailing edge. Operational history The prototype Fokker S.14 wearing the markings of the Nationaal Lucht en Ruimtevaart Labortorium (NLL) at Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam, in 1967, soon after its retirement During October 1955, the Machtrainer entered service with the Royal Netherlands Air Force; deliveries of the type continued until November 1956. Only 19 of the 20 aircraft ordered by the Netherlands Air Force entered service, one being destroyed in a fatal crash in the United States while being used by Fokker as a demonstrator prior to delivery. The S.14 fleet was in use for over a decade, during which a second aircraft was lost in a fatal crash in 1964.Uijthoven 2003, pp. 54‚Äì56. Of the original production run, two aircraft were lost in accidents; the remainder were scrapped in the years following their withdrawal during the late 1960s. Three still exist today including the original prototype (K-1, PH-XIV), which was operated by the Nationaal Lucht en Ruimvaart Laboratorium (NLL), located at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, until retirement in March 1966.Dekker, 1987, p. 137. It was then displayed at the Aviodome museum at Schiphol before moving to the museum at Lelystad Airport by 2008. The production aircraft L-11 is preserved at the Royal Netherlands Air Force museum in Soesterberg. L-17 is undergoing renovation. There was a fourth, L-18, which was positioned besides one of the entrances at Fokker facility at Ypenburg, but this aircraft was scrapped during 1994 at the same time as the site was being closed down.Uijthoven 2003, p. 57.

It is also known as a Butterworth squared filter. A Linkwitz-Riley \\"L-R\\" crossover consists of a parallel combination of a low-pass and a high-pass L-R filter. The filters are usually designed by cascading two Butterworth filters, each of which has ‚àí3 dB gain at the cut-off frequency. The resulting Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley filter has a ‚àí6 dB gain at the cutoff frequency. This means that summing the low-pass and high-pass outputs, the gain at the crossover frequency will be 0 dB, so the crossover behaves like an all-pass filter, having a flat amplitude response with a smoothly changing phase response. This is the biggest advantage of L-R crossovers compared to Butterworth crossovers, whose summed output has a +3 dB peak around the crossover frequency. Since cascading two nth order Butterworth filters will give a (2n)th-order Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley filter, theoretically any 2n-order Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley crossover can be designed. However, crossovers of higher order than 4th may have less usability due to their complexity and increasing peak in group delay around crossover frequency. Common types =Second-order Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley crossover (LR2, LR-2)= Second-order Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley crossovers (LR2) have a 12 dB/octave (40 dB/decade) slope. They can be realized by cascading two one-pole filters, or using a Sallen Key filter topology with a Q0 value of 0.5. There is a 180¬∞ phase difference between the low-pass and high-pass output of the filter, which can be corrected by inverting one signal. In loudspeakers this is usually done by reversing the polarity of one driver if the crossover is passive. For active crossovers inversion is usually done using a unity gain inverting op-amp. =Fourth-order Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley crossover (LR4, LR-4)= Fourth-order Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley crossovers (LR4) are probably today's most commonly used type of audio crossover. They are constructed by cascading two 2nd-order Butterworth filters. Their slope is 24 dB/octave (80 dB/decade). The phase difference amounts to 360¬∞, i.e. the two drives appear in phase, albeit with a full period time delay for the low-pass section. =Eighth-order Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley crossover (LR8, LR-8)= Eighth-order Linkwitz‚ÄìRiley crossovers (LR8) have a very steep, 48 dB/octave (160 dB/decade) slope. They can be constructed by cascading two 4th-order Butterworth filters.

Brown Jr. (September 26, 1922 ‚Äì October 27, 2011) was one of the top amateur tennis players in the world in the 1940s and a consistent winner in veterans' and seniors' competitions. He was the son of Thomas P. Brown, a newspaper correspondent, later public relations director for a railroad, and Hilda Jane Fisher, who became a schoolteacher when Tom was a boy. Though born in Washington, D.C., Tom was considered a San Franciscan all his life, having been brought west by his parents (both native Californians) at the age of two. Biography Tom Brown Jr. got his start playing tennis at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park where on weekends his parents played, and Tom tagged along. He quickly became intrigued with the sport, was soon beating his parents and winning citywide children's championships. He was captain of the tennis teams at both Lowell High School and the University of California-Berkeley. For one for whom tennis was never the main event in life, he had a successful record in the sport, before devoting himself to a law practice and raising a family. At his best he had wins over top players of his era. As Private First Class Brown won the singles title of the prestigious Pacific Coast Championships in October 1945, the second oldest tennis tournament in the U.S. Brown won it four times, twice in singles, twice in doubles. Then, fresh out of the Army after World War II, he reached the 1946 Wimbledon semifinals, in which he led that year's eventual champion, France's Yvon Petra, by two sets before losing. In demand as a doubles partner among the world's best, both men and women, Brown, with Jack Kramer, won the 1946 Wimbledon men's doubles against Australia's Geoff Brown and Dinny Pails. He also won its mixed doubles, teamed with Louise Brough, against Dorothy (Dodo) Bundy and Geoff Brown. The same year, at the French, he played the mixed finals with \\"Dodo\\" and reached the semis of the singles (losing to Jaroslav Drobny). At the U.S. Nationals, he reached the men's singles finals by defeating Fred Kovaleski, Tom Falkenburg, Bitsy Grant, Herbie Flam, Frank Parker and Gardnar Mulloy, then he was defeated by Kramer. At the Australian championships in 1947, Brown beat Adrian Quist, then lost to Dinny Pails in the semifinals. In the Wimbledon singles in 1947, Brown beat defending champion Petra and future champion Budge Patty, then lost easily to Kramer in the final. At the French (held after Wimbledon for the last time), he lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Jozsef Asboth, and he was in the men's doubles finals with Billy Sidwell of Australia. In 1948 at Wimbledon, he teamed with Gardnar Mulloy, losing the men's doubles final to the Australian duo John Bromwich and Frank Sedgman. Brown also took the U.S. mixed doubles title with his favorite partner, Louise Brough. It was 16 years before he gave Wimbledon another shot. In both 1964 and 1965. he was put out in the second round of the men's singles; in 1965 by John Newcombe who, several years later, became a three-time Wimbledon champion. He played men's doubles those years with (respectively) Hugh Stewart and Gene Scott. Both were first=round losses. Kramer wrote in his 1979 autobiography The Game, My 40 Years in Tennis that Brown \\"was known as 'The Frisco Flailer' (we had nicknames like that in those days), and he was strong off the ground with an excellent running forehand, but he was always my pigeon.\\" Kramer was the only player who \\"owned\\" Brown, beating him nine straight matches without the loss of a set. Brown was also on three U.S. Davis Cup teams, and in 1950, against Australia, playing his second challenge round singles, he won the U.S.'s only point in five hard-fought sets, defeating Ken McGregor, who became the 1951 Wimbledon singles finalist and the 1952 Australian singles champion. Brown had a lifelong passion for travel, a wanderlust he said he acquired as a two-year-old when he and his mother took a train ride out west from Washington, D.C. to Merced, California to join his father. The family then settled in San Francisco. During his law-practice years, whenever he got the chance to travel to a tennis tournament he took it, and well into his 30s, he was beating the world's top amateur competition. During and well beyond his active playing career, Brown was ranked in the U.S. top 10 eight times between 1946 and 1958, reaching as high as No. 3 in 1946.\\"Kramer Tops Tennis Rankings\\", St. Petersburg Times, 15th December 1946. He was ranked World No. 7 for 1946 by Pierre Gillou and for 1947 by both John Olliff and Harry Hopman.\\"World's Best 10 in Tennis\\", The Courier-Mail, February 3, 1947. At ages 47 and 48, Brown won the National Men's 45-and-over hard court singles. He also took the U.S. National doubles 45-and-over three times, once with Art Larsen and twice with Tony Trabert. Upon retirement from his law practice, he fully embraced senior tennis, and at the age of 65 in 1987, won the USTA National Grand Slam in the 65-and-over singles, triumphing on hard, clay, grass and indoor surfaces, an almost unique accomplishment in the annals of U.S. veterans‚Äô tennis. In 1988, the International Tennis Federation named him Outstanding Veterans Player in the world. Brown won numerous national titles as a senior player: 24 singles and 11 doubles, pairing with Bobby Riggs three times and Fred Kovaleski eight times. Brown's last national title was in 1998.

Licenses and assignments of intellectual property rights are common operations in the technology markets, as well as the use of these types of assets as loan security. These uses give rise to the growing importance of financial valuation of intellectual property, since knowing the economic value of patents is a critical factor in order to define their trading conditions.  Cases of application  Valuation of patent rights is one of the main activities related to intellectual property management within an organization or company. Indeed, knowing the economic value and importance of the intellectual property rights assists in the strategic decisions to be taken on the company's assets, but also facilitates the commercialization and transactions concerning intellectual property rights. There are several business situations where valuation is required: = Valuation of a company for the purposes of a merger, acquisition, joint venture or bankruptcy = Most of the technological companies are highly based on intangible assets and investment in knowledge, research and innovation. According to studies, expenditures on knowledge, through investments in R&D; or software, have grown at a higher rate than expenditures in tangible assets. This change in investments has consequently been reflected by a heavy importance of intangible assets and patents in companies. Therefore, to know the value of companies it is essential to know the value of their intellectual property. = Negotiations to sell or license intellectual property rights = As in other business transactions, organizations negotiating agreements to sell or license intellectual property and patent rights commonly have to agree on a price. Knowing the value of the intellectual property rights is essential to reach such an agreement, but also to make sure the parties are engaging in a good deal. = Support in situations of patent conflict or dispute = In scenarios of patent conflict, such as patent infringement proceedings or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, quantification of damages is often a necessary step of the process. The correct valuation of the intellectual property right at stake is therefore essential to guarantee a fair recovery of the damages. = Fund raising through bank loans or venture capital = Valuation of the intellectual property to be used as security for bank loans or to attract venture capital and investors is essential. Several studies reveal that, in particular, owning patents and a proper intellectual property management play a crucial role in the decision of venture capitalists. = Assisting internal decision making for patent protection strategies = Valuation also plays a role on decisions concerning the patenting strategies and country selection for registration of intellectual property rights, or can assist organizations to identify weaknesses such as ownership uncertainties that have an impact in the value of the intellectual property rights and on decisions for the exploitation of such assets. = For accounting and taxation purposes = Organizations are required to report on their assets, including their intangible assets. Valuation is therefore a necessary step, as well as in situations of tax planning involving intellectual property. Defining the objectives and context of the valuation is essential, since it determines the strategy as well as the type of valuation method that should be used. This is therefore the first step to take when performing a valuation.  Methods  Different approaches of patent valuation are used by companies and organizations. Generally, these approaches are divided in two categories: the quantitative and qualitative valuation. While the quantitative approach relies on numerical and measurable data with the purpose to calculate the economic value of the intellectual property, the qualitative approach is focused on the analysis of the characteristics and potential uses of the intellectual property, such as the legal, technological, marketing or strategic aspects of the patented technologies. Qualitative valuation deals also with assessing the risks and opportunities associated to the intellectual property of the company. = Quantitative approach = Several methodologies are used on the quantitative approach, but generally they can be grouped in four methods:Flignor, P., D. Orozco ‚ÄúIntangible Asset & Intellectual Property Valuation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective‚Äù, 2006 :* Cost-based method :* Market-based method :* Income-based method :* Option-based method  Cost- based method  This method is based on the principle that there is a direct relation between the costs expended in the development of the intellectual property and its economic value. Two different techniques are mainly used to measure costs: # Reproduction cost method: Estimations are performed by gathering all costs associated with the purchase or development of a replica of the patent under valuation. # Replacement cost method: Estimations are performed on the basis of the costs that would be spent to obtain an equivalent patent asset with similar use or function. In both methods, present prices are taken into account, i.e. the expenditures as of the valuation date and not the historical costs when these actually happened.Drews, D., ‚ÄùThe Cost Approach to IP Valuation: Its Uses and Limitations‚Äù, IP Metrics Intellectual Property Valuation, 2001 For assessing costs, two cost sources of two sorts should be included: direct expenditures, such as costs with materials, labor and management; and opportunity costs, relating to the lost profits due to delays in market entrance or investment opportunities lost with the aim of developing the assets.  Market-based method  The market-based valuation method relies on the estimation of value based on similar market transactions (e.g. similar license agreements) of comparable patent rights. Given that often the asset under valuation is unique, the comparison is performed in terms of utility, technological specificity and property, having also in consideration the perception of the asset by the market. Data on comparable or similar transactions may be accessed in the following sources: # Company annual reports. # Specialized royalty rate databases and publications. # In court decisions concerning damages.  Income-based method  This method is based on the principle that the value of an asset is intrinsic to the expected income flows it generates. After the income is estimated, the result is discounted by an appropriate discount factor with the objective to adjust it to the present circumstances and therefore to determine the net present value of the intellectual property. There are different methods of calculation of the future cash flows, such as: # Discounted cash flow method: This method aims to estimate future cash flows, which are projected and after discounted by applying an appropriate discount factor. The main source of information to estimate the cash flows is generally the business plan of the company that exploits or intends to exploit the asset. # Relief-from-royalty method: In this method the value of the asset is considered as the value of the royalty payments from which the company is relieved due to its ownership of the asset. Hence, the appropriate royalty rate must be determined, allowing the estimation of the future royalty income stream. A discount rate is applied to determine the present value of the asset.  Option-based method  Differently from the other methods, the option methodology takes into consideration the options and opportunities related to the investment.Kamara, A., ‚ÄúIntroduction to real options‚Äù, CFO Forum, 2002 It relies on option pricing models (e.g. Black-Scholes) for stock options to achieve a valuation of a given intellectual property asset. In these cases,See for example: Robert Pitkethly (1997). The Valuation of Patents: A review of patent valuation methods with consideration of option based methods and the potential for further research, Judge Institute Working Paper WP 21/97; Markus Reitzig. Valuing patents and patent portfolios from a corporate perspective: theoretical considerations, applied needs and future challenges - Ch. 15 in Derek L. Bosworth and Elizabeth Webster (2006). The Management of Intellectual Property. patents may be valued using the techniques developed for financial options, as applied via a real options framework.See Aswath Damodaran: Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation and Option Pricing Applications in Valuation; Fernando Torres MSc. Conceptual Patent Value Framework, The Patent Value Guide. The key parallel is that a patent provides its owner the right to exclude others from using the underlying invention, so both patents and stock options represent a right to exploit an asset in the future, and to exclude others from using it. The patent (option) will have value to the buyer (owner) only to the extent that the expected price in the future exceeds the opportunity cost of earning just as much in a risk-less alternative. Thus patent rights can be thought of as corresponding to a call option and may be valued correspondingly. See Contingent claim valuation, as well as , for further discussion. = Qualitative approach = This method does not rely on purely financial analytical data. In fact, the valuation in this method is performed through the analysis of different indicators with the purpose of rating the patent right, i.e. of determining its importance quality in terms of aspects that can impact the value of an intellectual property asset, covering legal aspects, the technology level of the innovation, market details and company organization. Commonly, the method is implemented through questionnaires comprising all these different criteria. Examples of questions included in such questionnaires can be: :* How would you define the patented technology innovation compared to the actual state of the art? :* Which level of its life cycle has the patent reached? :* What is the geographic coverage of the reference market?

The ship was named after a noted Shinto shrine in Fukuoka, Japan. Background The Katori-class cruisers were originally ordered to serve as training ships in the 1937 and 1939 Supplementary Naval Budget. With the Pacific War, they were used as administrative flagships for various fleets, such as submarine command and control and to command escort squadrons. The ships were upgraded as the war progressed with additional anti-aircraft guns and depth charges. Service career =Early career= Kashii was completed by Mitsubishi shipyards in Yokohama on 15 July 1941 and was initially assigned to Sasebo Naval Base. With the growing tensions in the Pacific, Kashii was subsequently (31 July 1941) assigned to the Southern Expeditionary Fleet under Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa. On 18 October 1941, Kashii became the flagship of the Southern Expeditionary Fleet based out of Saigon, French Indochina. One month later, Kashii was transferred to Hainan and Vice Admiral Ozawa transferred his flag to the cruiser . On 5 December 1941, Kashii departed Cap St. Jacques, French Indochina escorting seven troops of transports carrying the Imperial Japanese Army's 143rd Infantry Regiment to Kra Isthmus (Thailand) and Malaya, and was thus still en route at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. =Early stages of the Pacific War= After the initial landings in Malaya and Thailand, Kashii returned to Camranh Bay, Indochina on 13 December 1941 to rendezvous with 39 means of transports of the Second Malaya Convoy, which it then escorted to various points along the eastern coast of Thailand and Malaya. It also escorted the Third Malaya convoy from 26‚Äì28 December 1941. On 3 January 1942, Kashii rescued troops from the troop transport Meiko Maru which had caught fire and exploded off of Hainan. From January through March, Kashii patrolled an area from Singapore to Bangkok and eastern Dutch East Indies. On 11 February 1942, it escorted the 11 transports of the Bangka- Palembang, Sumatra invasion force, and on 12 March 1942, participated in \\"Operation T\\" (the invasion of North Sumatra). Kashii became a flagship of the No. 2 Escort Unit on 19 March 1942, which escorted 32 transports with the IJA 56th Infantry Division for the invasion of Burma, and an additional 46 transports carrying the IJA's 18th Infantry Division in early April. On 11 April 1942, Vice Admiral Ozawa transferred his flag back to Kashii which was now based in Singapore. However, on 14 July 1942 Vice Admiral Denshichi Okawachi replaced Vice Admiral Ozawa. Kashii continued with patrol duties in the eastern Indian Ocean off Burma, the Andaman Islands, and Penang through September. On 21 September 1942, Kashii departed Saigon on an emergency transport mission to reinforce Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands. Kashii used a fake second funnel in an attempt to mimic an American heavy cruiser. The ruse succeeded, and Kashii successfully landed reinforcements at Rabaul, New Britain on 8 October 1942. It returned to Singapore without incident and resumed its normal patrol duties until mid-January 1943. In January 1943, Kashii underwent retrofit at Keppel dockyard in Singapore, to truncate its masts and add a \\"submarine spotting station\\" to its foretop. Kashii resumed its patrol area in the eastern Indian Ocean from February through end July 1943. 9 March 1943 Vice Admiral Yoshikazu Endo replaced Vice Admiral Okawachi as commander of the First Southern Expeditionary Fleet, Malay Force. From 24 July 1943 ‚Äì 22 August 1943, Kashii made two transport runs carrying troops and supplies to Port Blair and Car Nicobar. On 29 August 1943, off Pulo Weh, north Sumatra en route to Sabang, Kashii was attacked by the Royal Navy submarine , which fired all eight of its bow torpedoes but missed. Kashii made five more troop and supply runs to the Andaman Islands from 21 September 1943 - 27 November 1943 without incident. On 31 December 1943, Kashii was reassigned to the Kure Training Division, arriving at Etajima in February 1944 after retrofitting at Sasebo to assume duty as a training ship for the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. However, its time as a training vessel was very short. On 25 March 1944, Kashii was reassigned directly to Headquarters, General Escort Command, and was modified for anti-submarine warfare at Kure Naval Arsenal. Its torpedo tubes were removed and replaced by two Type 89 127 mm twin mount HA guns. Four triple mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns were also installed bringing the total to 20 barrels (4x3, 4x2), a Type 21 air-search radar was fitted and hydrophones and sonar were also added. Kashiis aft compartments were modified into concrete-protected magazines for up to 300 depth charges. Four depth charge throwers and two rails are installed on the quarterdeck. The modification work was completed by 29 April 1944. =Later stages of the Pacific War= Kashii became flagship for Rear Admiral Mitsuharu Matsuyama's No. 1 Surface Escort Division on 3 May 1944 and departed Moji on 29 May 1944 escorting a convoy to Singapore. On 2 June 1944, the submarine spotted the convoy east of Taiwan, and sank one of its ships with two torpedoes, but Kashii was undamaged and arrived at Singapore on 12 June 1944 with the remaining vessels in the convoy. Further, refit was undertaken at Kure on 28 June 1944, with ten single mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns installed, bringing the total to 30 barrels (4x3, 4x2, 10x1), and a new Type 22 surface- search radar was also fitted at that time. Kashii departed again on 13 July 1944 from Moji, escorting convoy HI-69 loaded with aircraft for Luzon in the Philippines. The convoy arrived safely in Manila, and after offloading aircraft, proceeded to Singapore, returning to Moji without incident on 15 August 1944. Another convoy mission was undertaken to the Philippines on 25 August 1944. On the return voyage, Kashii was flagship for Rear Admiral Setsuzo Yoshitomi's 5th Escort Group escorting convoy HI-74. The convoy was attacked on 16 September 1944 by the submarines and , which sank two oilers and the aircraft carrier . More than 900 crewmen were lost, along with 48 aircraft. Kashii and the remaining ships rescued 761 survivors, reaching Moji on 23 September 1944. The next convoy mission (HI-79) to Singapore from 26 October 1944 - 9 November 1944 was uneventful. After arrival, Rear Admiral Shiro Shibuya replaced Admiral Yoshitomi as CINC of the new 101st Escort Group. The return run from Singapore to Sasebo from 17 November 1944 to 4 December 1944 was uneventful. On 10 December 1944, Kashii was reassigned to the 1st Surface Escort Group and departed Moji for Takao, Taiwan with a convoy of Army transports. From Takao, Kashii was assigned another convoy to Singapore. The new convoy was attacked by USAAF B-25 Mitchell bombers off Hainan on 25 December 1944 but escaped with little damage. Kashii sinking on 12 January 1945 The return voyage with convoy HI-86 consisted of ten ships (4 tankers and 6 cargo ships) and the 101st Escort Group's five frigate CD kaibokans, which departed Singapore on 30 December 1944. On 12 January 1945, shortly after departing Qui Nhon Bay, Indochina, bombers from the U.S Task Force 38 comprising the aircraft carriers , , , , , and attacked convoy HI-86 during the South China Sea raid, sinking most of the convoy's ships. Kashii was hit starboard amidships by a torpedo from a Grumman TBF Avenger, then a Curtiss SB2C Helldiver struck with two bombs aft, setting off the depth charge magazine. Kashii sank stern first at . Of Kashiis crew, 621 men went down with the ship and only 19 were rescued. Kashii was removed from the Navy list on 20 March 1945.

Odo was known as an ardent lover of books, and a great theologian who preached in French, English, and Latin. There is some uncertainty as to his writings, owing to confusion with Odo of Cheriton and Odo of Murimund, but a list of thirteen works, chiefly writings on the Old Testament and sermons, can be ascribed to him. The origin of the expression \\"To Jesus through Mary\\" is generally attributed to Louis Grignion de Montfort. However, the idea of going through Mary to Jesus is much older, and was promoted by such authors as Ildephonse of Toledo (+667), Germanus of Constantinople (+773), John of Damascus (+750), et al.

As a player, he was a forward from 1986 until 2012, however since 1999 he had mixed his playing duties with various coaching and management positions. He notably played in the Premier League for Crystal Palace, and in the Football League for Northampton Town, Wrexham, Stockport County, Blackpool and Bury. He became player-manager of Bury in 1999, also going on to manage Worcester City and Northwich Victoria. Playing career Born in Evesham, Worcestershire, Preece began his career as a junior with Worcester City, making his debut in the Conference aged 16. He subsequently played for Evesham United before joining Northampton Town in August 1988. He made just one appearance, as a substitute, before being released at the end of the following season. In July 1989 he rejoined Worcester City and in March 1990 signed for Wrexham. In December 1991 he joined Stockport County for a fee of ¬£10,000. He impressed enough (including scoring the winning goal in a giant-killing feat against Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup) that he signed for Crystal Palace in June 1994, as strike partner to Chris Armstrong, for a fee of ¬£350,000. However, he struggled to establish himself and joined Blackpool for a fee of ¬£200,000 in July 1995. In July 1997 Preece joined Bury on a free transfer.

It was renamed Barrett's Cross in 1824 after an early settler who established an inn in the area. In 1862, the town was renamed after Kensington Palace in London and it became a town after the Prince Edward Island Railway's mainline from Charlottetown to Summerside curved through the community. The town's former railyards are now rehabilitated as a tourist venue, with the former Kensington Railway Station designed by architect Charles Benjamin Chappell designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1976.  Events  Aside from being a service centre for the surrounding farming areas, Kensington hosts many notable events throughout the year. These include the Kensington Harvest Festival, Miss Community Gardens pageant, and many more.  Education  Kensington has schools from Preschool to Secondary. It is part of the English Language School Board (formerly part of the Western School Board) District of schools.

Chocho is Spoken by 770 speakers (1998 Ethnologue Survey). Chocho is a tonal language distinguishing low, mid and high tones. Carol Mock (1982) argues that Chocho distinguishes morphosyntactically between subjects of willful actions whether they are transitive or intransitive and subjects of unwillful actions. This results in her analysing Chocho as an active‚Äìstative language. As an example of how this works here is an example showing that the subject is marked with a different suffix depending on whether the action of the verb is active or inactive In an active/voluntary transitive phrase the agent/subject is marked by the active suffix \\"-√°\\" and the patient by the inactive clitic \\"-mƒ´\\". The patient/subject of an intransitive active/voluntary phrase is marked by the same suffix. *'''' :aspect-see-first.person.exclusive.active/second.person.informal.inactive :\\"I saw you\\" *'''' :aspect-arrive-first.person.exclusive.active :\\"I arrive\\" However in an involuntary/inactive intransitive phrase the subject/patient is marked with the inactive clitic \\"m√°\\" like an object/patient of a transitive phrase. *'''' :aspect-fall-first.person.exclusive.active :\\"I fall\\" This morphosyntactic alignment would imply Chocho is a Split-S type active language. However, some intransitive verbs can use either the active person suffixes or the inactive enclitic, this suggests that it does in fact belong to the Fluid-S type active language.

He was the co-founder of Vignelli Associates, with his wife, Lella. His ethos was, \\"If you can design one thing, you can design everything,\\" and this was reflected in the broad range of his work. Vignelli worked firmly within the Modernist tradition, and focused on simplicity through the use of basic geometric forms in all his work. Life Vignelli studied architecture at the Politecnico di Milano and later at the Universit√† Iuav di Venezia. From 1957 to 1960, he visited America on a fellowship, and returned to New York in 1966 to start the New York branch of a new company, Unimark International, which quickly became, in scope and personnel, one of the largest design firms in the world. The firm went on to design many of the world's most recognizable corporate identities, including that of American Airlines (which forced him to incorporate the eagle, Massimo was always quick to point out). Vignelli designed the iconic signage for the New York City Subway system during this period, and the 1970s‚Äì80s map of the system. Contrary to news reports, Vignelli did not design the Washington Metro Map, which was designed by Lance Wyman and Bill Cannan. Vignelli created the signage and wayfinding system for the DC Metro and suggested it be named \\"Metro\\" like many other capital city subways. Its original name was a mishmash of various states and transportation groups. In 1971, Vignelli resigned from Unimark, in part because the design vision which he supported became diluted as the company diversified and increasingly stressed marketing, rather than design. Lars M√ºller Publishers. Soon after, Massimo and Lella Vignelli founded Vignelli Associates. Vignelli worked with filmmaker Gary Hustwit on the documentary Helvetica, about the typeface of the same name. Vignelli also updated his 1972 New York City Subway map for an online-only version implemented in 2011 and described as a \\"diagram\\", not a map, to reflect its abstract design without surface-level features such as streets and parks. Vignelli equipped his own home with tables, chairs, lamps and other items that he designed himself.Heller, Steven, Massimo Vignelli, New York Times Magazine, December 28, 2014, p.58 Vignelli died on May 27, 2014 in New York City.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/business/massimo-vignelli-a- modernist-graphic-designer-dies-at-83.html Work Vignelli worked in a wide variety of areas, including interior design, environmental design, package design, graphic design, furniture design, and product design. His clients at Vignelli Associates included high-profile companies such as IBM, Knoll, Bloomingdale's and American Airlines. His former employee Michael Bierut wrote that \\"it seemed to me that the whole city of New York was a permanent Vignelli exhibition [around 1981]. To get to the office, I rode in a subway with Vignelli-designed signage, shared the sidewalk with people holding Vignelli- designed Bloomingdale‚Äôs shopping bags, walked by St. Peter‚Äôs Church with its Vignelli-designed pipe organ visible through the window. At Vignelli Associates, at 23 years old, I felt I was at the center of the universe.\\" Vignelli participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007, as well as publishing the book, Vignelli: From A to Z, containing a series of essays describing the principles and concepts behind \\"all good design\\". It is alphabetically organized by topic, roughly approximating a similar course he taught at Harvard's School of Design and Architecture. Vignelli's designs were famous for following a minimal aesthetic and a narrow range of typefaces that Vignelli considered to be perfect in their genre, including Akzidenz-Grotesk, Bodoni, Helvetica, Garamond No. 3 and Century Expanded. He wrote that, \\"In the new computer age, the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest.\\" In January 2009, Vignelli released The Vignelli Canon as a free e-book; an expanded version was printed in September 2010, but the original remains available for download on the Vignelli Associates website. In the introduction Vignelli wrote, \\"I thought that it might be useful to pass some of my professional knowledge around, with the hope of improving [young designers'] design skills. Creativity needs the support of knowledge to be able to perform at its best.\\" Vignelli worked with the National Park Service and the design staff at the Harpers Ferry Center in creation of the \\"Unigrid System.\\" The system has been used since 1977 in creation of park brochures in all national parks locations. New York City Subway map Vignelli's 1972 subway map In August 1972, Vignelli's design for the New York City Subway map appeared on the walls of subway stations and became a landmark in Modernist information design. Vignelli regarded the map as one of his finest creations. =Origin of the map= The origins of the map lie in the problems of the previous decade. In the mid-1960s New York City Transit Authority was facing unprecedented difficulties in delivering information to its riders: * Inconsistent and out- of-date signage still referred to the old operating companies (IRT, BMT, IND) long after they had been subsumed under a single public authority. * An influx of 52 million visitors for the 1964 New York World's Fair (April 1964 to October 1965) highlighted shortcomings in wayfinding information for public transportation in New York City. * Structural changes to the subway network (costing $100 million) to reduce bottlenecks, in particular the Chrystie Street Connection (approved 1963, expected 1965, opened at the end of 1967New York Times, June 24, 1963), effectively merged two of the three historical networks. To deal with this, the TA created the role of Director of Public Information and Community Relations, and hired former newspaper reporter Len Ingalls.New York Times, July 27, 1964 In his later years, Vignelli often said that the most important factor in the success of a design project was having a good client, and he praised Ingalls for being a very good one. Ingalls began an overhaul of both signage and the subway map. When Unimark International opened an office in New York in 1965, Mildred Constantine, curator of design at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) put Ingalls in touch with Vignelli, who headed up the New York office from the end of 1965. In the Spring of 1966, the TA engaged Unimark to redesign the subway signage and review the ongoing changes to the map. Robert Noorda and Massimo Vignelli created a system of signage that the TA adopted and which still pervades every station in the subway today. But the TA did not follow up Vignelli's preliminary study of the map as they were already at the testing stage of their own new map.Peter Blake, \\"Get Off at N1,1,2,3,7,SS,QB,RR,NX,EE - The Crossroads of the World\\", New York magazine, April 8, 1968NYCTA Press Release, November 16, 1967 =The 1970s Vignelli map= The TA's new map, released in 1967, used Raleigh D'Adamo's principle of color-coding for the first time, but it suffered from what Vignelli called \\"fragmentation\\" and was not well received. The following year, the parent body Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) was formed over the TA, chaired by Dr William J. Ronan, who wanted to create a modern brand image for this new body. While the Unimark signage project was still being finished off up with the creation of the New York City Transit Authority Graphics Standards Manual, Vignelli went to Ronan with a mock-up of part of the map for lower Manhattan.Peter B. Lloyd, \\"Vignelli: Transit Maps\\" (RIT Press, 2012) p. 47 Ronan approved it, and in July 1970 the TA awarded Unimark a contract to design a new system map. The map was put together in the Unimark Office by Joan Charysyn under Vignelli's design direction. In April 1971, Vignelli left Unimark to set up Vignelli Associates. By this time, the map was almost complete, but was subject to corrections and modifications requested by Raleigh D'Adamo, who was now Head of the Office of Inspection and Review at the MTA. These changes were carried out by Charysyn, who also oversaw the printing of the map. Unimark's liaison with the MTA during this project was handled by Norbert Oehler. The map was unveiled by Ronan on August 4, 1972 at a ceremony in the station at 57th Street and Sixth Avenue.New York Times, August 5, 1972 After the mechanical for the map was handed over in 1972, Vignelli had no further control over the map. Six further editions were produced from 1973 to 1978, with extensive changes. In 1974, William Ronan was replaced by David Yunich as chairman of the MTA. Yunich was formerly an executive at Macy's department store, and brought an explicit intention to 'sell' the subway to riders. He recruited Fred Wilkinson from Macy's who formed the Subway Map Committee in 1975 to design a new map to replace Vignelli's. The next year John Tauranac was made chair of the committee, which concluded in June 1979 with a geographic map using a trunk-based color scheme designed by Michael Herz Associates.Hogarty, Dave. \\"Michael Hertz, Designer of the NYC Subway Map,\\" Gothamist (AUG. 3, 2007). The Vignelli map was replaced by a newer design, which is still used. =The 2000s Vignelli map= 2008 subway map At the end of 2007, Mark Rozzo, an editor at Men's Vogue magazine, invited Vignelli to submit a commemorative edition of his map for inclusion in a 'design classics' edition of the magazine. This invitation precipitated the thinking of the team at Vignelli Associates, who had for some time been considering how they would do the map differently. Massimo Vignelli, Yoshiki Waterhouse, and Beatriz Cifuentes worked together to build a new, up-to-date map from scratch. Besides the general principle of a systematic and minimalist design, they added the specific requirement that the map should preserve spatial relations between stations. For example if one station is east of another station in real life, then it must be so on the map. This defused one of the most persistent criticisms of the 1972 map. Their wholly new map was released through the May 2008 edition of Men's Vogue: within hours, all 500 signed prints were sold for charity at US $299 each. In 2011, the MTA began to look at ways of displaying service disruptions due to weekend engineering works in a visual format. They invited Vignelli to develop a digital version of the 2008 map. This was released on the MTA's Weekender web site on September 16, 2011. Since then it has undergone several revisions and is still in use today, with weekly updates of service changes. =Super Bowl map= The last map in which Vignelli was involved was a special transit map, designed by Yoshiki Waterhouse at Vignelli Associates, for Super Bowl XLVIII. The game was played on February 2, 2014, at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold-weather city. Private cars were not allowed to park at the stadium, so the use of public transportation was correspondingly increased. With 400,000 visitors expected to the area and 80,000 attendees expected at the game itself, the MTA decided to work with New Jersey Transit (NJT), Amtrak, and NY Waterway to produce a special-purpose Regional Transit Map. The map brought in several innovations: * The transit map showed both New York and New Jersey. It was the first time that an MTA-produced subway map had done that. * Besides showing the New York City Subway, the map also includes the MTA's Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit lines, and Amtrak lines, all in the consistent visual language of the Vignelli map. * For the first time since 1979, the MTA issued a Vignelli map on paper. * For the first time, a Vignelli map added in topographic features (the MetLife Stadium, the Prudential Center, and the Super Bowl Boulevard). =SuperWarmRed= The Vignelli discipline of mapmaking is continued by Waterhouse and Cifuentes through the new design firm SuperWarmRed Designs, formed in December 2014. Prints of the 2012 edition of the subway map as used in the MTA Weekender site can be obtained through SuperWarmRed.

The ship was named after the noted Shinto shrine Kashima Jingu in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. Background The Katori-class cruisers were originally ordered to serve as training ships in the 1937 and 1939 Supplementary Naval Budget. With the Pacific War, they were used as administrative flagships for various fleets, such as submarine command and control and to command escort squadrons. The ships were upgraded as the war progressed with additional anti-aircraft guns and depth charges. Service career =Early career= Kashima was completed at the Mitsubishi Yokohama shipyards on 31 May 1940 and was initially based at Kure Naval Base in the Inland Sea. On 28 July 1940, Kashima and its sister ship participated in the last pre-war midshipman cruise visiting Etajima, Ominato, Dairen, Port Arthur and Shanghai. Soon after its return to Japan, Kashima was reassigned to the Japanese Fourth Fleet as flagship for CruDiv 18. On 1 December 1941, Kashima became flagship for Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue's Fourth Fleet based at Truk in the Caroline Islands. At the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, Kashima was at Truk. =Early stages of the Pacific War= During \\"Operation R\\" (the invasions of Rabaul and Kavieng), which took place from 23‚Äì24 January 1942, Kashima sortied from Truk to cover the landings of Japanese troops. Kashima later (20 February 1942) sortied from Truk in an unsuccessful pursuit of the aircraft carrier and American Task Force 11. On 4 May 1942, during \\"Operation MO\\" (the invasions of Tulagi and Port Moresby), Kashima arrived at Rabaul, New Britain to direct operations, and was thus absent at the Battle of the Coral Sea, which occurred around the same time. After the successful landings of Japanese forces on New Guinea, Kashima returned to its base at Truk. In July 1942, Kashima returned briefly to Kure for upgrading with two twin Type 96 25 mm AA guns, which were fitted in the forward part of the bridge. It then returned to Truk on 3 September 1942, where it continued to be based. On 8 October 1942, a conference was held aboard Kashima to discuss the construction of defenses in the Pacific. The conference was attended by Rear Admiral Matome Ugaki Chief of Staff, Combined Fleet, and Imperial Japanese Army officials of the Defense Construction Department. Later that month, on 26 October 1942 Vice Admiral Baron Tomoshige Samejima assumed command of the Fourth Fleet. He was replaced on 1 April 1943 by Vice Admiral Masami Kobayashi. During this time, Kashima was assigned to guard duty at Truk, with an occasional cruise around the Marshall Islands, or occasional return to Kure or Yokosuka for maintenance. On 1 November 1943, Kashima was relieved as flagship of the Fourth Fleet by the light cruiser and was reassigned back to the Kure Training Division. On 18 November 1943, Kashima departed Truk with the submarine tender escorted by destroyers and . Shortly after departing Truk, the group was attacked by the submarine , which the Kashima group managed to sink without Japanese casualties. Kashima arrived at Kure on 25 November 1943, and was in dry-dock until 12 January 1944. From 23 January - 15 April 1944, Kashima resumed its original role as a training ship for the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima, and it makes numerous cruises in the Inland Sea. =Later stages of the Pacific War= However, as the war situation continued to deteriorate for Japan, Kashima was pressed into service as a transport. From 26 May 1944 to 11 July 1944, it made four runs from Shimonoseki to Okinawa carrying army reinforcements and supplies. Likewise, from 11 July 1944 in \\"Operation Ro-Go\\", Kashima was assigned to transport personnel and supplies to Taiwan, making numerous voyages from Kagoshima and Kure to Keelung. On 20 October 1944, Kashima was spotted by the submarine , which closed to within , but was unable to attack as its new Mark 18-1 electric torpedoes lacked the speed and range. On 20 December 1944, Kashima was modified at Kure Naval Arsenal with its torpedo tubes replaced by two unshielded twin 40-caliber Type 89 127 mm HA-gun mounts, four triple-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns, along with a Type 22 surface- search radar, hydrophones and sonar. Two Type 2 infra-red communication devices were also installed. Kashimas aft compartments were modified into concrete-protected magazines for up to 100 depth charges, with four depth charge throwers and two rails installed on the quarterdeck. In addition, eight Type 96 single mount 25 mm AA guns were added, bringing the total number to 38 barrels, and a Type 13 air-search radar was also installed. From February 1945, Kashima was assigned to anti-submarine patrol duty in the South China Sea and off Korea. On 19 May 1945, Kashima collided with and sank the cargo ship Daishin Maru in Tsushima Strait. A gasoline tank in Kashimas port bow was damaged in the collision, causing a fire, but she managed to make it to Chinkai, Korea for repairs. Kashima continued its convoy escort and anti- submarine patrols off Korea until the end of the war. Kashima was officially stricken from the Navy list on 5 October 1945. Postwar career After the war, the American authorities used Kashima as a repatriation transport. A deck house was constructed around her main mast, and the barrels of her guns were sawn off. From 10 October 1945 ‚Äì 12 November 1946 Kashima made a total of 12 voyages to New Guinea, the Solomon islands, Marshall islands, Singapore, French Indochina, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong, transporting some 5,800 former Imperial Japanese Army troops and POWs back to Japan. Between 15 November 1946 and 15 June 1947, Kashima was broken up for scrap at Nagasaki.

It is held annually in mid-May over a two-day period along the Schuylkill River near Boathouse Row in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Competing crews come from schools all over North America, though most hail from the Northeastern and Mid- Atlantic United States. The regatta has many different events (30 in 2011) in which high school crews compete for various cups and trophies. Events vary by sex, age, weight category, number of rowers, and style of rowing (whether sweeping with one oar per rower or sculling with two oars per rower). The regatta takes its name from the main event, the Men's Senior Eight race, in which crews of eight oarsmen and one coxswain compete for the Stotesbury Cup. The Stotesbury Cup in turn is named for Edward T. Stotesbury of Philadelphia, a prominent partner at J.P. Morgan & Co. and its Philadelphia affiliate, Drexel & Co. The Women's Senior Eights compete for the Robert Engman Trophy. The regatta has been running men's races since 1927; women's events were added in the mid-1970s. Powerhouse schools in men's events include Episcopal Academy, Christian Brothers Academy, St. Augustine Preparatory School, LaSalle High School, Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Holy Spirit, Atlantic City High School, St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.), St. Joseph's Prep, Gonzaga College High School, Winter Park High School, and Roman Catholic High School for Boys. Episcopal Academy, having dominated the Senior and Junior Four division from 2015-2016, made the Grand Final in the Men's Senior Eight in 2017. The same year, Gonzaga College High School was overtaken by Montclair High School for first place in the Men's Senior Eight.Cochran, margot. \\"Montclair crew wins coveted Stotesbury Cup\\", The Record (Bergen County), May 23, 2017. Accessed November 20, 2017. \\"Montclair High School athletes won the top award in scholastic rowing at the Stotesbury Cup Regatta this past Saturday on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. The most coveted award of the regatta is the Stotesbury Cup, which is awarded to the winner in the boys varsity (senior) eight competition each year.... The Gonzaga College High School crew from Washington, D.C., who were the defending champions for the last five years, took silver while St. Albans School from Bethesda, Md. took bronze.\\" Meanwhile, in women's events, National Cathedral School (Washington, D.C.) has won the Senior Eight category twice (2016-2017) and finished second once (2014) in the last four years. The Men‚Äôs Lightweight 8 category for the James R. Muldowney Memorial Trophy has been dominated by St. Joseph's Prep. On May 18th, 2019, they won for the 10th consecutive time (2010-2019) and the 20th time in the last 23 years. Mount Saint Joseph Academy has also emerged in recent years with strong showings in the Lightweight Eight and Senior Eight categories and Bishop Eustace Preparatory School won the Senior Eight category for three consecutive years (2007-2009). Merion Mercy Academy having won Silver in 2016 in the Women's Senior Eight won Gold in both the Women's Senior Four and Lightweight Eight in 2017. Racecourse The Stotesbury racecourse is the standard high school length of 1500 meters. It begins a few hundred meters upstream from the Strawberry Mansion Bridge and finishes downstream just before the Columbia Railroad Bridge. It is a six-lane course, and as in most races the favored crews are positioned in the middle lanes. The river current is strongest in the final four hundred meters of the race as crews pass Peters Island on the west side of the course. Lane 6, closest to Peters Island, generally has the slowest water current, making it the least desirable lane in this downstream racecourse. Organization Stotesbury's unique racing format does not have heats, 6 boats across racing in the normal sprint fashion, as the opening event. Instead, each event goes in a time trial format, similar to a head race, but only covering 1500 meters. The starting order is based on the finish order from the previous year's regatta. The fastest crews in each time trial advance to the semi-final round. Semi-finals begin later on the first day and continue on the second day. Finals begin in the afternoon of the second day. Events are ordered so that small boats race before the larger ones, and the regatta culminates in either the Men's or Women's Senior Eight final race, alternating every year. After each final is finished, the best three boats dock at the grandstands next to the finish line to receive their medals. The Stotesbury Cup Regatta continues to grow in its size and level of competition as high school rowing gains popularity. In 2000, about 3,500 athletes competed in the regatta. In 2016, 5,679 athletes from 191 schools competed in 984 boats to make it the largest Stotesbury yet. As the sport continues to grow, this trend will likely persist as more and more rowers carry on the Stotesbury tradition.

These bipolar neurons innervate the hair cells of the organ of Corti. They project their axons to the ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei as the cochlear nerve, a branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). Structure Neurons whose cell bodies lie in the spiral ganglion are strung along the bony core of the cochlea, and send fibers (axons) into the central nervous system (CNS). These bipolar neurons are the first neurons in the auditory system to fire an action potential, and supply all of the brain's auditory input. Their dendrites make synaptic contact with the base of hair cells, and their axons are bundled together to form the auditory portion of eighth cranial nerve. The number of neurons in the spiral ganglion is estimated to be about 35,000‚Äì50,000. Two apparent subtypes of spiral ganglion cells exist. Type I spiral ganglion cells comprise the vast majority of spiral ganglion cells (90-95% in cats and 88% in humans), and exclusively innervate the inner hair cells. They are myelinated, bipolar neurons. Type II spiral ganglion cells make up the remainder. In contrast to Type I cells, they are unipolar and unmyelinated in most mammals. They innervate the outer hair cells, with each Type II neuron sampling many (15-20) outer hair cells. In addition, outer hair cells form reciprocal synapses onto Type II spiral ganglion cells, suggesting that the Type II cells have both afferent and efferent roles. =Development= The rudiment of the cochlear nerve appears about the end of the third week as a group of ganglion cells closely applied to the cephalic edge of the auditory vesicle. The ganglion gradually splits into two parts, the vestibular ganglion and the spiral ganglion. The axons of neurons in the spiral ganglion travel to the brainstem, forming the cochlear nerve.

Keller maintains that such an impact predates the mass extinction and that Deccan volcanism and its environmental consequences were the most likely major cause possibly exacerbated by the impact.  Early life and education  Keller was raised in Switzerland on a dairy farm, the sixth of 12 children. She grew up in poverty. In the one-room schoolhouse where she was educated, boys were given training in math and science while girls were taught cooking and cleaning, the skills they would need to be proper housewives. Her hunger for knowledge led her to read the textbooks assigned to her elder siblings, and she would prepare summaries of the material for her brothers and sisters. She attended a vocational school starting at age 14 and learned sewing. There she organized a protest against rules that required female students to wear skirts, as she rode her bicycle three miles each way to school and wanted to be able to protect herself from the cold. The female students won the right to wear pants from then on. After receiving her vocational certificate at age 17, she went to work for Pierre Cardin, where she was paid the equivalent of 25 cents per hour to sew luxury gowns that would sell for as much as $1,000 for which she was paid $12. She traveled around the world, learning English and working in England, followed by travel to North Africa, Spain and Australia. She survived being shot in a bank robbery in Australia in 1965, despite awakening in a hospital intensive care unit to find a priest pressing her to confess, telling her that she was going to die. After ending up in San Francisco in 1968, Keller was \\"freaked out\\" by the shots and tear gas launched at student protests; she chose to focus on education and took a high school equivalency exam. She received her undergraduate degree at San Francisco State University and received a doctorate in geology and paleontology from Stanford University in 1978.  Paleontology  After earning her doctorate, Keller worked for the United States Geological Survey and Stanford. She came to Princeton University in 1984 and after a few years started studying the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìT boundary), the geological signature of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event.Schultz, Steven. \\"Dinosaur dust-up: Princeton paleontologist produces evidence for new theory on extinction\\", Princeton Weekly Bulletin, September 22, 2003. Accessed June 11, 2009. Keller's research has led her to conclude that the Chicxulub asteroid impact, the leading hypothesized cause for the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, predates the event to the degree that it could not have been the sole cause. \\"I'm sure the day after, they had a headache,\\" Keller states, further stating that \\"we vastly overestimate the damage to the environment and to life that this Chicxulub impact had\\".Velasquez-Manoff, Moises. \\"Did Asteroids Really Do in the Dinosaurs?: Scientists Challenge the Story of How the Dinosaurs' 160-Million-Year Reign Came to an End\\", ABC News, May 24, 2009. Accessed June 11, 2009. The main evidence for the Alvarez hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact resulted in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, supported by earth sciences consensus, comes from the presence around the world of shocked quartz granules, glass spherules and tektites embedded in a layer of clay with extremely high levels of iridium, all signs of an asteroid impact. Keller's research found layers where the glass spherules and the iridium clay are separated by as much as of sandstone and other material. Supporters of the Alvarez hypothesis have concluded that the sandstone is the result of a massive tsunami caused by the Chicxulub impact that sandwiched the sand between the shocked quartz layer and the iridium clay. Keller's analysis of the strata between the spherules and iridium clay concludes that the material was laid down over as much as 300,000 years based on signs of plankton, worms and weathering found on the intervening material.Lovett, Richard A. \\"'Dinosaur Killer' Asteroid Only One Part of New Quadruple-Whammy Theory\\", National Geographic, October 30, 2006.

A convent of Ursuline nuns said they had been visited and possessed by demons. Following an investigation by the Catholic Church, a local priest named Father Urbain Grandier was accused of summoning the evil spirits. He was eventually convicted of the crimes of sorcery and burned at the stake. The case contains similar themes to other witchcraft trials that occurred throughout western Europe in the 17th century, such as the Aix-en- Provence possessions (France) in 1611 or the Pendle witches (England) in 1612 before reaching the New World by the 1690s. Background In its continuing efforts to consolidate and centralize power, the Crown under Louis XIII ordered the walls around Loudun, a town in Poitou, France, to be demolished. The populace were of two minds concerning this. The Huguenots, for the most part, wanted to keep the walls, while the Catholics supported the monarchy. In May 1632, an outbreak of the plague in Loudun claimed many lives. Together, the events contributed to an atmosphere of anxiety and apprehension in the divided town.Hunter, Mary Kay. \\"The Loudun Possessions: Witchcraft Trials\\", Legal History & Rare Books, American Association of Law Libraries Vol. 16 No. 3 Hallowe‚Äôen 2010 Urbain Grandier Urbain Grandier was born at Rouv√®re towards the end of the sixteenth century. In 1617 he was appointed parish priest of St-Pierre-du-March√© in Loudun; and a canon at the Church of Sainte- Croix. Grandier was considered to be a good-looking man, wealthy, and well- educated. An eloquent and popular preacher, he incurred the envy of some of the local monks. As he did not support Cardinal Richelieu's policies, he was in favor of retaining the town's wall. It was widely believed that Grandier had fathered a son by Philippa Trincant, the daughter of his friend, Louis Trincant, the King's prosecutor in Loudun.Rapley, Robert. A Case of Witchcraft: The Trial of Urbain Grandier (Montreal: McGill-Queen‚Äôs University Press, 1998) According to Monsieur des Niau, Counsellor at la Fl√®che, Grandier had aroused the hostility of a number of husbands and fathers, some quite influential, by the dishonor he had brought to their families through relations with the female members of their households. (However, Niau's views may be understood as those of a participant in the subsequent proceedings who fully endorsed them.)Monsieur des Niau, La Veritable Histoire des Diables de Loudun, (Edmund Goldsmid, ed.) Edinburgh, 1887 Around 1629, Jacques de Thibault, possibly a relative of Philippa, was quite vocal in expressing his opinion of Grandier's conduct with women. When Grandier demanded an explanation, Thibault beat him with a cane outside the Church of Sainte-Croix. In the course of the resulting trial, Thibault raised certain charges in his defense, causing the magistrates to turn Grandier over to the ecclesiastical court. The Bishop then prohibited Grandier from performing any public functions as priest for five years in the Diocese of Poitiers, and forever in Loudun. Grandier appealed to the court at Poitiers. As a number of witnesses retracted their statements, the case was dismissed without prejudice should new evidence be presented. Loudon Ursulines The Ursuline convent was opened in Loudun in 1626. In 1632 prioress Jeanne des Anges presided over seventeen nuns, whose average age was twenty-five. The first reports of alleged demonic possession began about five months after the outbreak of plague (disease) in 1632, as it was winding down. While physicians and wealthy property owners had left town, (the physicians because there was nothing they could do), others attempted to isolate themselves. The convents had shut themselves behind walls, the nuns discontinued receiving parlor visitors. Grandier visited the sick and gave money to the poor.Certeau, Michel de. The Possession at Loudon, (Michael B. Smith, trans.) University of Chicago Press, 2000 A young nun said that she had had a vision of her recently deceased confessor, Father Moussant. Soon other nuns reported similar visions. Canon Jean Mignon, the convent chaplain who was also a nephew of Trincant, decided that a series of exorcisms was in order. In the town, the people were already saying it was an \\"imposture\\". The nuns claimed the demon Asmodai was sent to commit evil and impudent acts with them. During questioning about the supposed evil spirit thought to be possessing them, the nuns gave several answers as to who caused its presence: a priest, Peter, and Zabulon. It was only after almost a week, on October 11, that Grandier was named as the magician responsible, though none of them had ever met him. Next, \\"physicians\\" and apothecaries were brought in. Canon Mignon informed the local magistrates of what was happening at the convent. Grandier filed a petition stating that his reputation was under attack and that the nuns should be confined. The Archbishop of Bordeaux intervened and ordered the nuns sequestered, upon which the appearances of possession seemed to subside for a time. The nuns' increasingly extreme behavior: shouting, swearing, barking, etc. drew a considerable number of spectators. Eventually, Cardinal Richelieu decided to intervene. Grandier had already offended Richelieu by his public opposition to the demolition of the town walls, and his reputation for illicit relations with parishioners did not improve his standing with the cardinal.\\"Loudun Nuns\\", Encyclopedia of Witchcraft: The Western Tradition, (Richard Golden, ed.) ABC-CLIO, c. 2006) In addition, Grandier had written a book attacking the discipline of clerical celibacy as well as a scathing satire of the cardinal. Investigation Around the time of the nuns' accusations, Jean de Laubardemont, was sent to demolish the town tower. He was prevented from doing so by the town militia, and upon returning to Paris reported on the state of affairs in Loudun including the recent disturbance at the Ursuline convent. In November 1633, de Laubardemont was commissioned to investigate the matter. Grandier was arrested as a precaution against his fleeing the area. The Commissioner then began to take statements from witnesses who said Grandier often mysteriously appeared at the convent at all hours, although no one knew how he was able to get inside. The priest was further accused of all manner of indecency. Laubardemont then questioned Grandier as to the facts and articles of accusation, and after having made him sign his statement and denials, proceeded to Paris to inform the Court. Letters from the Bailly of Loudun, Grandier's chief supporter, to the Procurator-General of the Parlement, in which it was asserted that the possessions were an imposture, were intercepted. The latter's reply was also seized. Monsieur des Niau, La Veritable Histoire des Diables de Loudun, (Edmund Goldsmid, ed.) Edinburgh, 1887 Trial Urbain Grandier's alleged diabolical pact Monsieur de Laubardemont returned to Loudun with a Decree of the Council, dated 31 May 1634, confirming all his powers and prohibiting Parlement and all other judges from interfering in the matter, and forbidding all parties concerned from appealing, under penalty of a fine of five hundred livres. Grandier, who had been held at the prison of Angers was returned to Loudon. Laubardemont once again observed and interrogated the nuns, now dispersed among a number of convents. The Bishop of Poitiers, after having sent several Doctors of Theology to examine the victims, came to Loudun in person, and over the next two and half months, himself performed exorcisms, as well as Fathers Tranquille O.F.M.Cap. On June 23, 1634, the Bishop of Poitiers and M. de Laubardemont being present, Grandier was brought from his prison to the Church of Ste. Croix in his parish, to be present at the exorcisms. All the possessed were there likewise. And as the accused and his partisans declared that the possessions were mere impostures, he was ordered to be himself the exorcist, and the stole was presented to him. He could not refuse, and therefore, taking the stole and the ritual, he received the pastoral benediction, and after the Veni Creator had been sung, commenced the exorcism in the usual form. In August 1634, the case was heard before the local magistrates. It was alleged that Grandier had made a pact with the devil,\\"Pact allegedly signed between Urbain Grandier and the Devil, submitted as evidence during the 1634 Loudun Possession Trial\\", Columbia College and had invited someone to a witches' sabbat. Grandier was found guilty of sorcery and placing evil spells to cause the possession of the Ursuline nuns; he was condemned to be burned at the stake. > We have ordered and do order the said Urbain Grandier duly tried and > convicted of the crime of magic, maleficia, and of causing demoniacal > possession of several Ursuline nuns of this town of Loudun, as well as of > other secular women, together with other charges and crimes resulting > therefrom.

Among other tortures, Grandier was subjected to \\"the boot\\". Execution Grandier was taken to the Court of Justice of Loudun. His sentence having been read to him, he earnestly begged M. de Laubardemont and the other Commissioners to mitigate the rigour of their sentence. M. de Laubardemont replied that the only means of inducing the judges to moderate the penalties was to declare at once his accomplices. The only answer he gave was, that he had no accomplices. The executioner then advanced, as is always done, to strangle him; but the flames suddenly sprang up with such violence that the rope caught fire, and he fell alive among the burning faggots. Burning at Loudun Father Grandier was promised that he could have the chance to speak before he was executed, making a last statement, and that he would be hanged before the burning, an act of mercy. From the scaffold Grandier attempted to address the crowd, but the monks threw large quantities of holy water in his face so that his last words could not be heard. Then, according to historian Robert Rapley, exorcist Lactance caused the execution to deviate from the planned course of action‚Äîenraged by taunting from the crowd that gathered for the execution, Lactance lit the funeral pyre before Grandier could be hanged, leaving him to be burned alive. The possessions failed to stop after Father Grandier's execution; as a result, public exorcisms continued. In his summary of the Loudun possessions, author Moshe Sluhovsky reports that these displays continued until 1637, three years after Grandier's death: \\"[t]he last departing demons left clear signs of their exit from her [Jeanne des Anges, the mother superior of the community] body, when the names Joseph and Mary miraculously appeared inscribed on des Anges's left arm.\\" Allegedly, the Duchess d'Aiguillon, niece to Cardinal Richelieu, reported the fraud to her uncle. Having achieved his original goal, Richelieu terminated the investigations into the events at Loudun. Some claim that it was actually Jeanne des Anges who had the public exorcisms stopped. Jeanne allegedly had a vision that she would be freed from the Devil if she made a pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Francis de Sales. She went to Annecy, then visited Cardinal Richelieu and King Louis XIII in 1638; the demons were apparently gone. Post historical analysis Ag√©nor de Gasparin suggests that the early so-called \\"demonic manifestations\\" were actually pranks played by some of the boarding students in an effort to frighten some of the nuns; and as the matters progressed, it was the chaplain Jean Mignon who introduced Grandier's name to the suggestible nuns. Gasparin, Ag√©nor de. A Treatise on Turning Tables: The Supernatural in General, and Spirits, Vol. 2, Kiggins, 1857, p. 165 Michel de Certeau attributes the symptoms of the nuns as due to some psychological disorder such as hysteria, and views the events in context of the shifting intellectual climate of 17th century France. Possession allowed the nuns to express their ideas, concerns, and fears through the voice of another. The events at Loudun played out over a number of years, and attracted a good deal of attention throughout France. In this sense it was a sort of political- theatre. Grandier serves as a scapegoat to deflect the Loudon's ambivalence regarding the central Parisian authority.Benedicty-Kokken, Alessandra. Spirit Possession in French, Haitian, and Vodou Thought: An Intellectual History, Lexington Books, 2014, p. 187 Aldous Huxley, in his non-fiction book, The Devils of Loudun, argued that the accusations began after Grandier refused to become the spiritual director of the convent, unaware that the Mother Superior, Sister Jeanne of the Angels, had become obsessed with him, having seen him from afar and heard of his sexual exploits. According to Huxley, Sister Jeanne, enraged by his rejection, instead invited Canon Jean Mignon, an enemy of Grandier, to become the director. Jeanne then accused Grandier of using black magic to seduce her. The other nuns gradually began to make similar accusations. However, Monsieur des Niau, Counsellor at la Fl√®che, said that Grandier applied for the position, but that it was instead awarded to Canon Jean Mignon, a nephew of Monsieur Trincant. Monsieur des Niau, La Veritable Histoire des Diables de Loudun, (Edmund Goldsmid, ed.) Edinburgh, 1887 Augustin Calmet, among others, has compared this case to the pretended possession of Martha Broissier (1578), a case which garnered a great deal of attention in its day. This comparison is based in part on the circumstances surrounding the incidents as well as the examinations of the possessions in question, all of which indicate pretended possessions, in contrast to cases considered more legitimate such as the possession of Mademoiselle Elizabeth de Ranfaing (1621). In his treatise, Calmet states that the causes of the injustice committed at Loudun were a mixture of political ambition, the need for attention, and a basic desire to dispose of political opponents. Calmet places the blame for the tragedy in Loudun with Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, and his goal of ruining Urbain Grandier, the Cure of Loudun. Grandier's fate was likely sealed through obstructing the Cardinal's plan to demolish Loudun's fortifications, including the Castle of Loudon. The demolition, to be overseen by Jean de Laubardemont, was part of Richelieu's program of eliminating Huguenot strongholds by destroying local fortifications.Werse, Nicholas R., \\"Loudon Possessions\\", Spirit Possession around the World: Possession, Communion, and Demon Expulsion across Cultures, (Joseph P. Laycock, ed.) ABC-CLIO, 2015, p. 220 Both Protestant (Huguenot) and Catholic residents of Loudun were against the removal of their battlements, which would have left them unprotected against mercenary armies. Grandier cited the King's promise that Loudun's walls would not be destroyed, successfully preventing Laubardemont from demolishing the fortifications. Laubardemont promptly reported back to Richelieu with an account of the failed exorcisms, the libelous satire, and Grandier's obstruction of Richelieu's plans, thus setting the tragedy in Loudun and Grandier's demise in motion. Richelieu's strategy for destroying Grandier brought with it an added benefit for the Catholic Church: conversions. Many of the Protestant townspeople converted to Catholicism as a result of the public exorcisms, further eroding any Huguenot sentiment in the region.

The ship was named after the noted Shinto Katori Shrine in Chiba prefecture, Japan. Background Katori-class cruisers were originally ordered to serve as training ships in the 1937 and 1939 Supplementary Naval budget. With the Pacific War, they were used as administrative flagships for various fleets, such as submarine command and control, and to command escort squadrons. The ships were upgraded as the war progressed with additional anti-aircraft guns and depth charges. Service career =Early career= Katori was completed at the Mitsubishi Yokohama shipyards on 20 April 1940 and was based at nearby Yokosuka. On 28 July 1940, Katori and her sister ship, participated in the last pre-war midshipman cruise visiting Etajima, Ominato, Aomori, Dairen, Port Arthur and Shanghai. =Early stages of the Pacific War= On 11 November 1941 Vice Admiral Mitsumi Shimizu, CINC, Sixth Fleet (Submarines) convened a briefing of his commanders aboard the Sixth Fleet's flagship, Katori on the planned attack on Pearl Harbor. Katori departed for Truk on 24 November 1941. At the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, Katori was at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. On 10 December 1941, the submarine reported sighting the aircraft carrier and two cruisers heading northeast, and Vice Admiral Shimizu ordered his submarines to pursue and sink the carrier, but it escaped. Katori returned to Truk by the end of 1941, and on 3 January 1942 Vice Admiral Shimizu held a briefing to discuss the details of the invasion plans for \\"Operation R\\" (the invasions of Rabaul and Kavieng), which took place from 23‚Äì24 January 1942. On 1 February 1942, Katori came under attack at Kwajalein by Douglas SBD Dauntlesses of VB-6 and VS-6 and Douglas TBD Devastators from the carrier . Vice Admiral Shimizu was wounded in the raid, and Katori sustained enough damage to warrant a return to Yokosuka for repairs. The ship returned to Kwajalein in May, where on 24 May 1942 the new admiral, of the Sixth Fleet (Submarines) Vice Admiral Marquis Teruhisa Komatsu, ordered Captain Sasaki Hankyu detachment of midget submarines to stage the Attack on Sydney Harbour. Katori returned briefly to Yokosuka in August 1942 for upgrading with two twin Type 96 25 mm AA guns, which were fitted in the forward part of the bridge. It then returned to Truk, where it continued to be based (with occasional returns to Yokosuka). On 21 June 1943 Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi assumed command of the Sixth Fleet (Submarines), but after the fall of Kwajalein Katori was reassigned on 15 February 1944 to the General Escort Command. =Attack on Truk= Katori burning off Truk, 17 February 1944 In the American attack on Truk of 17‚Äì18 February 1944, the American Task Force 58 with nine aircraft carriers, supported by six battleships, ten cruisers and 28 destroyers, launched a massive attack on Truk. Katori had departed Truk shortly before the attack, escorting the armed merchant cruiser Akagi Maru, destroyers and , and minesweeping trawler Shonan Maru No. 15 towards Yokosuka, but came under attack by Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo-bombers from the carriers , , , and . Akagi Maru was sunk, and Katori was hit by a torpedo which did minor damage. However, several hours later, Task Group 50.9's battleships and , along with cruisers and and destroyers and , spotted the Katori group and opened fire. The screening destroyers fired six salvos of torpedoes at Katori (which was already listing slightly to port and on fire amidships), but all torpedoes missed. Katori responded with a salvo of torpedoes which were equally ineffective. At an average range of 14,500yds, Iowa closed with Katori and fired 46 high capacity (non-armor-piercing) rounds and 124 , straddling the cruiser with eight salvos. CAG 17/A16-3 reported Iowa hit Katori with her second salvo. Just after Iowas fourth salvo, Katori quickly listed to port exposing seven large shell holes about in diameter in her starboard side, one under the bridge about five feet below the waterline, another amidships about at the waterline, plus about nine smaller holes. The damage on the port side was much worse. After being under attack by Iowa for about 5 minutes, Katori sank stern first, with a port side list at about northwest of Truk. A large group of survivors were seen in the water after she sank, but the Americans did not recover any of them. Katori was officially stricken from the Navy list on 31 March 1944.

Flow visualization or flow visualisation in fluid dynamics is used to make the flow patterns visible, in order to get qualitative or quantitative information on them.  Overview  Flow visualization is the art of making flow patterns visible. Most fluids (air, water, etc.) are transparent, thus their flow patterns are invisible to the naked eye without methods to make them this visible. Historically, such methods included experimental methods. With the development of computer models and CFD simulating flow processes (e.g. the distribution of air-conditioned air in a new car), purely computational methods have been developed.  Methods of visualization  Shadowgraph of the turbulent plume of hot air rising from a home-barbecue gas grill. Photograph by Gary S. Settles, Floviz Inc. In experimental fluid dynamics, flows are visualized by three methods: * Surface flow visualization: This reveals the flow streamlines in the limit as a solid surface is approached. Colored oil applied to the surface of a wind tunnel model provides one example (the oil responds to the surface shear stress and forms a pattern). * Particle tracer methods: Particles, such as smoke or microspheres, can be added to a flow to trace the fluid motion. We can illuminate the particles with a sheet of laser light in order to visualize a slice of a complicated fluid flow pattern. Assuming that the particles faithfully follow the streamlines of the flow, we can not only visualize the flow but also measure its velocity using the particle image velocimetry or particle tracking velocimetry methods. Particles with densities that match that of the fluid flow will exhibit the most accurate visualization.http://microspheres.us/fluorescent-microspheres/piv-seeding- microparticle-flow-visualization/599.html PIV seeding particle recommendations * Optical methods: Some flows reveal their patterns by way of changes in their optical refractive index. These are visualized by optical methods known as the shadowgraph, schlieren photography, and interferometry. More directly, dyes can be added to (usually liquid) flows to measure concentrations; typically employing the light attenuation or laser-induced fluorescence techniques. In scientific visualization flows are visualized with two main methods: * Analytical methods that analyse a given flow and show properties like streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines. The flow can either be given in a finite representation or as a smooth function. * Texture advection methods that \\"bend\\" textures (or images) according to the flow. As the image is always finite (the flow through could be given as a smooth function), these methods will visualize approximations of the real flow.  Application  In computational fluid dynamics the numerical solution of the governing equations can yield all the fluid properties in space and time. This overwhelming amount of information must be displayed in a meaningful form. Thus flow visualization is equally important in computational as in experimental fluid dynamics.

It is the Capital of Kings County. In 2018 it amalgamated with the town of Montague, the rural municipalities of Brudenell, Cardigan, Lorne Valley, Lower Montague, and Valleyfield, and portions of three adjacent unincorporated areas.  History  This area of eastern Prince Edward Island traces its history of human settlement to the Mi'kmaq Nation, which long inhabited the area. These people were referred to as Epegoitnag and for them, the region was an Acadian forest. It had wild game, as well as fruit, berries and wild nuts for gathering, and plentiful marine resources in the nearby rivers and Northumberland Strait. The land in this area was called Samkook, which translates to 'the land of the sandy shore'. Georgetown lies opposite Brudenell Point, which divides the Brudenell River to the north from the Montague River to the south. Brudenell Point was the location of the first permanent Acadian settlement; French colonists called the island Ile-Saint-Jean. Here, entrepreneur Jean Pierre Roma landed in 1732 with approximately 100 settlers, to begin a commercial settlement to grow food and catch fish for provisioning the French military garrison at Fortress of Louisbourg on Ile-Royale (now Cape Breton Island). French settlers called the area Trois-Rivieres (Three Rivers). In conflict over control of the region, British colonists burned the village in 1745, at the same time that they took control of Port-la-Joye. Following the transfer of control of Acadia to Britain after it defeated France in the Seven Years' War in 1763, Captain Samuel Holland selected the entirety of Cardigan Point for the capital of Kings County, in a survey conducted for the Crown. He designated it as the township of Kings Royalty. The county capital was to be named Georgetown in honour of King George III. The settlement was oriented on magnetic north, and a broad street network was designed. Georgetown, being the shiretown for Kings County, has the county's only provincial court house. It was erected in 1887. Present-day Georgetown's collection of heritage buildings mostly dates to the late Victorian Era, when the town was at the height of its importance in the wooden shipbuilding industry. As one of the most important ports in the colony of Prince Edward Island, the port was selected in 1870 to be the eastern terminus of the Prince Edward Island Railway (PEIR). It also became a steamship terminal, with connections to the Intercolonial Railway on the mainland at Pictou, Nova Scotia. Georgetown's harbour was frequently the only port on the island that was usable during the winter months, because of prevailing wind and tide directions. (This was before the construction of the Canso Causeway altered sea ice patterns in the Northumberland Strait). On September 28, 2018, the Town of Georgetown amalgamated with the Town of Montague, five nearby rural municipalities - Brudenell, Cardigan, Lorne Valley, Lower Montague, and Valleyfield - and portions of three adjacent unincorporated areas.  Infrastructure  The Port of Georgetown is a deep water harbour situated in Cardigan Bay on the east coast of Prince Edward Island, south of the Port of Souris. The port remains ice-free from April 15 through December 31. Shipping through winter is not required by any of the current clientele. Georgetown is approximately 100 km from the port of Charlottetown, the capital of the province.\\"Port of Georgetown, PEI, Canada\\" The PEIR mainline from Georgetown extended through Montague Junction (where a spur was built to service nearby Montague) to Mount Stewart and on to Royalty Junction (connection to Charlottetown), Summerside and Alberton.  Economy  In the 20th century, Georgetown's industrial base diversified to include the island's only shipyard, East Isle Shipyard. Now owned by J.D. Irving Limited (JDI), it is well known for its construction of tugboats, such as Atlantic Spruce, Atlantic Oak, and the Royal Canadian Navy's Glen class tugs. The community is also home to the Island's largest saw mill (also owned by JDI). A major seasonal employer is a seafood plant, operated by Seafood 2000 and originally constructed by National Sea Products Limited.

It is about southeast of Exeter, just under southwest of Sidmouth and about northeast of Budleigh Salterton. Directly southwest of Ladram Bay are Smallstones Point and Chiselbury Bay. To the east is a hill called High Peak and below the hill are the Hern Point and Big Picket Rocks.  Geology  Among the most impressive sights along the Jurassic Coast are the sea stacks at Ladram Bay. The sandstones contain many vertical fractures and joints that were formed deep in the Earth's crust during past mountain building periods. The sea picked out these planes of weakness to form caves and natural arches that have since collapsed to produce sea stacks. The ‚ÄúOtter Sandstone‚Äù that forms the cliffs and sea stacks were deposited in a hot dry climates in the Triassic Period, about 220 million years ago. The stacks are composed of the same rock, which is relatively soft, but they have a harder band of sandstone at their base which prevents their rapid erosion by the sea. The striking red colour of the rock is caused by iron oxide, which indicate that the layers were formed in a desert. The presence of ripple marks and channels in the sandstones, together with the remains of the long-extinct plants, insects, fish, amphibians and reptiles, show that the desert was crossed by fertile river valleys. The Otter Sandstone Formation is the richest source of Triassic reptile remains in Britain and one of the most important in the world. At the south-west end of the bay, the most common fossils in the sandstone are networks of vertical, tube-like carbonate petrifactions (rhizocretions): these represent the roots of plants that were able to survive in the harsh dry climate of the Triassic Period. The bay is sited on the same band of sandstone that forms the oil reservoir at the Wytch Farm oilfield on the Isle of Purbeck.

The song gained renewed interest when it was included in 1991 on Atco Records' revised edition of their 1968 Soul Christmas compilation album and has since become a modern Christmas standard, with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers reporting that it was the 30th most-performed holiday song of all time. Phil Upchurch said the song was \\"absolutely the premiere holiday song written by an African American\\". It was written by Hathaway and Nadine McKinnor.

Acclaimed as a conductor ‚Äúwho was born to stand on a podium,‚Äù Phillips has appeared with more than 50 orchestras worldwide, including the Detroit Symphony, San Francisco Symphony, Rochester Philharmonic, Louisville Orchestra, Charlotte Symphony, Columbus Symphony, Netherlands Radio Chamber Orchestra and Iceland Symphony Orchestra, with which he recorded two compact disks. He has also conducted Regional and All-State Orchestras in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Vermont. With a repertoire of over 900 works performed in concert, Phillips has conducted much of the standard orchestral repertoire as well as many operas, musical theatre works and ballets. These include productions of Candide, Carmen, Die Fledermaus, Don Pasquale, Madama Butterfly, The Magic Flute, The Medium, Merrily We Roll Along, The Nutcracker, The Pirates of Penzance, Sweeney Todd and Tosca with such companies as the Boston Academy of Music, Commonwealth Opera, Ocean State Lyric Opera, Opera Providence, Connecticut Concert Ballet, Festival Ballet of Rhode Island and the Wisconsin Dance Ensemble. He has also guest conducted numerous choirs, including the Providence Singers, Hampshire Choral Society and Boston's Masterworks Chorale. Phillips's conducting honors include 1st Prize in the Wiener Meisterkurse Conductors Course and eight ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming of Contemporary Music, including 1st prize with the Brown University Orchestra in 2005 in the Collegiate Orchestra Division. He has conducted dozens of regional and world premieres, and hosted numerous composers-in-residence at Brown and with the Pioneer Valley Symphony, including Steve Reich, Steven Stucky, Joseph Schwantner, Samuel Adler, Lukas Foss, David Amram, William P. Perry, Michael Torke, Peter Boyer, George Walker and Gwyneth Walker. He has conducted concerts with Itzhak Perlman, Sergiu Luca, Christopher O'Riley, Matt Haimovitz, Carol Wincenc, Eugenia Zukerman and other noted soloists, as well as with Dave Brubeck, Dizzy Gillespie, Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, Dionne Warwick, Glen Campbell, Ferrante & Teicher, and other jazz and pop stars. In December 2006/January 2007, he led the Brown University Orchestra on a New Year's concert tour of China that included performances in Beijing's Poly Theatre, at the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and in Ningbo, Dalian, Suzhou and Changzhou. He premiered Elaine Bearer's \\"Seaselves\\" in 1994 composed on a poem by Lawrence Ferlinghetti performed by the Brown University Orchestra with poetry read by Salty Brine. Combined with other new pieces that Phillips conducted that year, this performance led to an ASCAP award for adventurous programming.

Music scholarship Phillips is the author of A Clockwork Counterpoint: The Music and Literature of Anthony Burgess (Manchester University Press, 2010), the first comprehensive study of Burgess's music and its relationship to his writings.https://muse.jhu.edu/article/514833/pdf He contributed the Anthony Burgess entry in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, several articles published in the Anthony Burgess Newsletter, the essay \\"The postmodernist always swings nice\\" in Anthony Burgess and Modernity (Manchester University Press, 2008), and the essay \\"That Man and Music: Ten Reasons Why Anthony Burgess‚Äôs Music Matters\\" in Anthony Burgess: Music in Literature and Literature in Music (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2009). His essay \\"Burgess and Music\\" will appear in the new Norton Critical Edition of A Clockwork Orange (Norton, 2010). In his book Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions, Richard Taruskin cites Phillips's article \\"The Enigma of Variations: A Study of Igor Stravinsky's Final Work for Orchestra\\" (Music Analysis, 1984) as \\"the best exposition in print of Stravinsky's serial methods.\\" Education Phillips, a graduate of Cranford High School in New Jersey, attended the Eastman School of Music before transferring to Columbia University, where he received a BA cum laude in music and MA in music composition. Subsequently, he received a MM in orchestral conducting from the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, where he studied with Gerhard Samuel. He completed additional studies at Tanglewood, Aspen Music Festival and School, Music Academy of the West, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, Mozarteum in Salzburg, and other music academies, studying with Leonard Bernstein, Leonard Slatkin, Kurt Masur, Seiji Ozawa, Michael Tilson Thomas, Otmar Suitner and other conductors. His composition and orchestration teachers include Karel Husa, Warren Benson, Samuel Adler, Fred Lerdahl, George Edwards, and Allen Sapp. He studied piano with Niels √òstbye, Kyriena Siloti and Jeanne-Marie Darr√©, among others. Film and television In the 1994 motion picture True Lies, Phillips briefly appears in the opening scene, which was filmed in Newport, RI. Arnold Schwarzenegger, portraying the spy Harry Tasker, crashes an exclusive private party, crosses the main ballroom, and turns into a library where he hands Phillips, bearded and wearing a tuxedo adorned by a white silk scarf around his neck, his glass of champagne before heading upstairs. In 1999, Phillips was featured as a performer and commentator on Anthony Burgess's music in the BBC television documentary The Burgess Variations written and narrated by Kevin Jackson and produced and directed by David Thompson.

It was noted for showcasing rising punk and new wave acts, including Bad Religion, Fear, the Dead Kennedys, 45 Grave, The Angry Samoans and The Circle Jerks. Format Peter Ivers, a Harvard-educated musician with a gregarious personality and a flair for the theatric, was the host for the entire run of the show. The format was extremely loose, owing partly to the desire to maintain the raw energy of the live performances and partly to the limited production budget. The program was presented in a format dubbed \\"live taped\\", in which the action was shot live and the video was then interspliced with video clips, photos, and graphics of everything from an exploding atomic bomb to a woman wringing a chicken's neck. The show started with a montage of clips from punk and new wave acts while the title appeared and the theme song, an abrupt mixture of Fear's \\"Camarillo\\" and The Blasters' \\"American Music\\", played. Ivers would appear at the beginning and end of each show wearing dark glasses, spouting a stream of consciousness spiel about life, art and music. Besides the top-billed music acts, short skits were shown, including Sri Maharooni, a chain-smoking Indian fakir speaking about the meaning of life, and Chris Genkel (played by actor Robert Roll), a pitchman hawking bizarre products for \\"gherkins\\" from his company, Genkel Wax Works, in Adonai, Illinois. Celebrities, including Debra Winger and Beverly D'Angelo, were known to show up at NWT's tapings; Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, who'd just begun hosting Elvira's Movie Macabre on KHJ-TV, appeared on Episode #2 and delivered one of the Genkel Wax Works commercials that week. New Wave Theatre came to an end in March 1983 when Ivers was found bludgeoned to death in his LA apartment. Rhino Video released two volumes of the best of New Wave Theatre in 1991 (Rhino Video numbers RNVD 2903 and RNVD 2904). Both are out of print, but used copies are not hard to find. The Top Ivers' friend, movie producer/director/writer Harold Ramis, offered Jove help and the result was a pilot show for local TV (KTLA) called The Top directed by Jove, produced by the then prolific music video producer Paul Flattery (he and Jove first collaborated on \\"Stop In The Name Of Love\\", a video for The Hollies, which incorporated many of Jove's signature public domain footage montages) and executive produced by Harold Ramis. Ramis basically lent his name (as well as industry clout, contacts and credibility) to the show which was conceived partially to continue the spirit of New Wave Theatre, but also to take advantage of the then-emerging music video scene. (Flattery's music video resume was a who's who of the 80's). Chevy Chase was the initial host, but during the taping of his monologue at the head of the show, he went off-script and invited a heckling (and drunk) audience member on stage with him. After hurling the guy off-stage, a fight broke out between Chase and the audience and Chase walked off the show. Shooting continued and then a week later, inserts were shot with Andy Kaufman as the host (in his last public appearance). The Top got good ratings but despite enlisting Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Cyndi Lauper, and The Romantics to perform during the pilot, the relationship between all of the parties - Jove, Flattery, Ramis and the KTLA executives - was so damaged by Jove's often bizarre and erratic behavior that no more episodes were produced.

While relatively little of his music survives, he was notable as one of the likely teachers of Palestrina. He was born in Noyon, but nothing is known of his early life. He was a chaplain at Santa Maria Maggiore, and was maestro di cappella of its Liberian chapel by 1540; while at this post, from late 1540 and possibly continuing for several years, he is thought to have been a teacher of the young Palestrina. In 1545 he became maestro di cappella at the church of San Luigi dei Francesi, a position he kept until 1561, at which time Annibale Zoilo was appointed in his place. On 4 September 1561, he joined the papal chapel; evidently he was highly regarded as a choir director and composer, for the entrance examination was waived in his case, by Pope Pius IV himself. After only four years, however, the chapel choir was dramatically reduced as part of the reforms of the Council of Trent, and Lebel was dismissed, along with many other singers, including Ghiselin Danckerts. Lebel remained in Rome for the rest of his life, and a requiem was sung in his honor in 1574 at the chapel of San Luigi dei Francesi. Only three of Lebel's works survive, all motets. Two, a setting of the Ave verum corpus and Sancta Maria succurre miseris, are for five voices, and the other, Puer natus est, is for six. Stylistically they are typical of the generation before Palestrina, during which the Franco-Flemish rather than Italians dominated the musical scene in Rome. References and further reading *Allan W.

Its original native range is not known, possibly it was the Caucasus of Western Asia. Suggestions that it originated in Southeast Europe may be based on misidentification. Description Crataegus heterophylla is a small tree of about in height, sometimes up to ; often semi-evergreen in character, with unusually variable leaves for a hawthorn. Some leaves are entirely smooth-edged, or have just a few (sometimes three) teeth at the apex only. These leaves are oblong, or ovate in shape. Other leaves are more sharply pointed, deeply lobed leaves. The former smooth leaf types can be found on the flowering shoots; the latter pointed types on the barren shoots. All the leaves are glossy, dark green in colour, and quite glabrous. The tree is heavily fruiting, with the long, narrow red berries attractive and a bird food source. Uses The various-leaved Hawthorn has been in cultivation in European and American parks and gardens since the early nineteenth century. This hawthorn is considered a beautiful tree for ornamental use, bearing a rich glossy foliage, sometimes retained during winter months (semi-evergreen), and with heavy fruiting. W.J.BeanBean, W.J. (1914);1996 edn. \\"Trees & Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles\\". John Murray Pubs Ltd comments that \\"It is a beautiful thorn ... bearing its large flowers and bright fruits freely. It is also one of the most distinct by reason of its variously shaped leaves, its long, narrow fruits, and the absence of down from the younger parts.\\" Today, mature specimens of the various-leaved Hawthorn can be seen in England where it has been formally planted, such as at the Royal Victoria Park in Bath; and in some places where it has naturalised, the most extensive such place being Abney Park Cemetery in London where it was planted long ago by Loddiges in an early Victorian garden cemetery arboretum. Loudon. Taxonomy This hawthorn can be confused even by experts with Crataegus monogyna, which has extremely variable leaf shape, and its origin is obscure. The tree was first described scientifically in 1808 in a French periodical.Johannes Fl√ºgg√© 1808. Annales du Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle 12(423) and plate 88 In England, it was also described in Dendrologia Britannica by the botanist P. W. Watson, but it is John Lindley's descriptionEdwards's Botanical Register 1828 (vol. 14, plate 1161) that is better known, which used Fl√ºgg√©'s name Crataegus heterophylla, as is now used. Reports that it is native to Spain appear to be based on misidentification of the Common Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna).Christensen, K.I. 1992. Revision of Crataegus sect. Crataegus and nothosect. Crataeguineae (Rosaceae-Maloideae) in the Old World. The American Society of Plant Taxonomists, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A. Some report it is only known in cultivation and not in the wild. It is thought by some to be a hybrid between the Crataegus monogyna and another species, perhaps the Azarole hawthorn (Crataegus azarolus). If it is of hybrid origin it may have arisen more than once. =Early confusion= Early ideas that it originated in North America were replaced by the perception that it has more in common with species from eastern Europe. Favouring an American origin was Joseph Paxton, who in 1840 listed it as having been introduced into Britain from North America in 1816.Paxton, Joseph (1840). \\"A Pocket Botanical Dictionary\\". J. Andrews in Google books Also, A. P. de Candolle published its country of origin as North America in his Podromus in 1825.De Candolle, A.P. 1825.

Treuttel et W√ºrtz, Paris. John Lindley in 1828 considered it to have little affinity with North American hawthorns, being closer to Eastern European species, and suggested it could be a relative of Azarole hawthorn (Crataegus azarolus), (under the name Crataegus maroccana Persoon). In the early twentieth century, W. J. Bean described it similarly, as a native of Armenia. Today, other authors also list it as native to Eastern Europe from Georgia and the Caucasus to nearby parts of Western Asia.

One of the principal bays of Corca Dhuibhne, it is located at the foot of An Tri√∫r Deirfi√∫r and Mount Brandon. Bounded by the villages of Baile an Fheirt√©araigh, Baile na nGall and Ard na Caithne itself, the area is what has been known as the F√≠or-Ghaeltacht, or true Gaeltacht (an area in which the Irish language is the official and principal language). Sign at Ard na Caithne Name The area's official and common Irish language name, Ard na Caithne, means \\"height of the arbutus\\" or \\"height of the strawberry tree\\". Ard na Caithne (formerly anglicised as \\"Ardnaconnia\\") was also known in Irish as Iorras Tuaiscirt (\\"north peninsula\\") and Gall-Iorras (\\"peninsula of the strangers\\"). The area's former English language name, Smerwick, is believed to derive from the Norse (Viking) words smoer and wick meaning \\"butter harbour\\". History =Early Christian history= The early Christian Gallarus Oratory and Mainistir Riaisc monastic site nearby are central archeological and tourist attractions. =Desmond rebellions= After the Holy See pronounced that Elizabeth was not Ireland's legitimate queen, James FitzMaurice FitzGerald and others initiated what became known as the Second Desmond Rebellion. While Fitzgerald himself was killed in August 1579, in September 1580, a force of 600 Italian- and Spanish-origin mercenaries, combined with some Irish and English Catholics, landed with arms for several thousand men to support the rebellion. Commanded by Sebastiano di San Giuseppe, and carrying a banner bearing the coat of arms of FitzMaurice, the force occupied D√∫n an √ìir ('Fort of the Gold') at Ard na Caithne. D√∫n an √ìir was an Iron Age promontory fort located near Ard na Caithne harbour. San Giuseppe's force was met by English and Irish Royal Army forces, precipitating the Siege of Smerwick. After a 3-day siege, San Giuseppe surrendered to forces under the command of Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton. Except for 20 or 30 officers, the fort's occupants were all executed immediately following their surrender. Charges for these killings were later brought against Sir Walter Raleigh; he avoided conviction by pleading that he was obeying orders from a superior officer. =Harbour= The harbour where Fitzmaurice's invasion force landed was also the landfall of the returning transatlantic expedition of Sir Martin Frobisher in 1578. Notable people In the nearby Caisle√°n an Fheirt√©araigh lived the 17th-century poet and Hiberno-Norman lord Piaras Feirit√©ar. He was executed at the hands of the Cromwellians in Killarney in 1653, following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, for his part in the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

However, the inspectors lowered the previous grade of the Sixth Form from \\"Good\\" in the 2008 report, to \\"Satisfactory\\", stating \\"standards have fluctuated since the school was last inspected but students make satisfactory progress\\".Profile, ofsted.gov.uk; accessed 22 October 2014. History =Grammar school= The school was founded around 1566 by Thomas Blount, Esq., Lord of the Manor of Kidderminster. It was in the chantry of the Parish Church of St. Mary and All Saints from 1566 until 1848, when it moved to the site known as Woodfield, on the Bewdley Road. It was granted its royal charter in 1636 by King Charles I and was the only school in England to bear his name. The original premises, Woodfield House built in 1785, and the Hall built about 1848, are now listed buildings. . =Comprehensive= When administered by Hereford and Worcester County Council in 1977 the Queen Elizabeth I Grammar School, Hartlebury (all Boys Grammar School) merged with the two Kidderminster grammar schools, King Charles I Grammar School for Boys and the Kidderminster High School for Girls, the latter was founded in 1868, and moved in 1912 to Hillgrove House, which is now also a Grade II listed building.Hill Grove House at King Charles I High School, Images of England, English Heritage National Monuments Record; accessed 22 October 2014. This marked the end of the Grammar School system in Kidderminster as the change was completed to comprehensive education. The transition to comprehensive took place gradually, until the early 1980s, becoming a ten-form entry a 13‚Äì18 comprehensive school from a six-form entry grammar school. =Mergers= It has been subject to several mergers and in line with district school reorganization, following an amalgamation of middle schools and high schools it reopened in 2007 to operate from two campuses, with a total capacity of around 1350 students aged 11 to 18. Under its new structure, the school retains its specialist status as a Science College that was awarded in 2003 and has facilities that cater for students with special needs. Following a November 2011 Ofsted inspection, the school was awarded a Grade 2 (Good) rating. =Buildings= The school was enlarged with the Brooks Building neighbouring the Sixth Form Rose Garden, and which functions as a science laboratory and theatre. The school has two campuses with the lower school for Year 7-8's operating from the premises of the former Comberton Middle School site in Kidderminster. On both campuses the school caters for linguistically challenged and autistic students in a Communication Centre, which has a facility on both sites.Ofsted report 2009; retrieved 25 July 2009. =Academy= The school converted to academy status in August 2012. Sixth form The School offers a sixth form for any students wishing to continue their post-16 studies. Students have the option of participating in activities such as a recognised first aid course, formal debate, and talks from lecturers on various issues such as driving skills and ethical issues in farming. Curriculum The school offers a wide range of extra-curricular provision, especially in sport. In July 1979 the school held the Guinness world record for the longest continuous cricket match.

It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a reliever airport. It is mostly used for general aviation but also serves a significant amount of law enforcement and military helicopter activity. Approximately 50% of Ryan's traffic is training-related. Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned RYN by the FAA but has no designation from the IATA (which assigned RYN to Royan - M√©dis Airport in Royan, France). The airport's ICAO identifier is KRYN. History According to historian David Leighton, after the surprise attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in December 1941, the military decided that an inland training location was preferred, to the current Ryan School of Aeronautics in San Diego, California founded by aviation pioneer T. Claude Ryan and Tucson was chosen as the site. Ground was broken in June 1942, for the new Ryan School of Aeronautics of Arizona under the direction of the U.S. Army Air Forces, located about 15 miles southwest of Tucson, along the Ajo Highway. By August 1942, the institution with its half-completed buildings and roofless offices, was training aviators in the Ryan P-22 aircraft, which functioned surprisingly well in the heat, wind and dust storms. Although crashes did occur at the school, at times, leading to death in certain incidents. By July 1943, when T. Claude Ryan, the president of the school returned the following year, Ryan Airfield had been completed. By this time the airfield had electricity, plumbing and air conditioning. The ground was covered with asphalt to hold the desert dust. It also had barracks and a PX.David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Ryan Airfield was founded by important early aviation pioneer,\\" Arizona Daily Star, Feb. 2, 2020 Military flight training at Ryan ceased in 1944 and the property was conveyed to the State of Arizona in 1948. Currently owned by the City of Tucson, Ryan is operated by the Tucson Airport Authority under an agreement which expires in 2054. An air traffic control tower was constructed at Ryan in 1993. The airport was added to the Contract Tower Program in 1996. In September 2004, the tower staff completed the one millionth operation without an error. In May 2010, the tower staff achieved two million operations without an error. Significant infrastructure improvements and major maintenance projects are accomplished continuously, as is private and commercial hangar construction. View of the tower and ramp at Ryan Airfield  Facilities and aircraft  Ryan Field covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has three runways with asphalt surfaces: *6R/24L is *6L/24R is *15/33 is Only runway 6R is serviced by an instrument approach. It allows pilots to land with ceilings as low as 250 feet above ground level. Runways 6L and 6R are the preferential runways, and they are used with tailwinds up to 10 knots. For the 12-month period ending March 31, 2009, the airport had 159,806 aircraft operations, an average of 437 per day: 97% general aviation and 3% military. At that time there were 192 aircraft based at this airport: 91.7% single-engine, 5.7% multi-engine, 2.1% helicopter, and 1.6% helicopter.

United States, 342 U.S. 246 (1952), is a U.S. Supreme Court case, relevant to the legal topic of criminal intent. It described two classes of crimes, those requiring a mental state, and those that do not. It did not delineate a precise line between them. In one class are traditional crimes, some of which have been around since before laws existed, such as stealing. This first class of crimes required a jury to find both an act, a harm, and an intent to act against the law. The second class, public welfare offenses, did not require a criminal mental state such as intent or knowledge. These included regulatory laws necessary for the public health and welfare, such as relating to food and drug safety. Morissette was a recycler who collected spent bomb casings from an Air Force practice bombing range, thinking they were abandoned, then sold them as scrap metal for $84.00. He was charged and convicted of \\"knowingly\\" converting government property to himself or the junk dealer. He defended that he honestly believed the casings were abandoned, and appealed. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction on the basis that \\"an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention\\", that the person must intend to commit a crime. The court wrote that it is \\"universal... in mature systems of law\\", that if there is to be punishment for a harmful act, there must be \\"some mental element\\". Crime is a \\"compound concept, generally constituted only from the concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-acting hand... As the states codified the common laws of crimes [wrote specific criminal laws], even if enactments were silent on the subject\\" of intention, and omitted to include it in the code, the state courts assumed the omission did not mean the legislature meant to exclude the requirement that a jury find criminal intent. Rather, it was evidence that \\"intent was so inherent\\" in the meaning of the concept of what constitutes a \\"crime\\", that it did not need to be mentioned in the statute. At the same time, the Morissette opinion acknowledges that the category of criminal legislation encompassing the statute in question must be distinguished from a different category of criminal statutes applicable to public welfare offenses. The Court notes that public welfare offenses, unlike common law crimes, do not intrinsically involve harm to the State, persons, property, or public morals, but are typified only by \\"neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty.\\"Id. at 255. Public welfare offenses ‚Äî examples of which include public health laws, building codes, or food and drug safety laws ‚Äî do not require a mental state or awareness on the part of the defendant.Id. at 256, 261. Background  The defendant, a part-time scrap metal dealer, entered an Air Force bombing range near Oscoda, Michigan, from which he collected spent bomb casings.Morissette v. United States, 187 F.2d 427 (6th Cir. 1951) These casings had been lying around for years. The defendant sold the casings at a junk market, earning a profit of $84. For this, the defendant was charged with violating which made it a crime to \\"knowingly convert\\" government property. The defendant conceded he had done the act. His sole defense was that he believed that the casings were abandoned property, and therefore there was no crime in taking them. After the trial, the trial judge instructed the jury with regard to the law, rejecting the defense. With regard to the intent requirement, \\"knowingly,\\" the trial judge assumed Congress had meant for the statute to operate under a tort law definition of intent. The jury was instructed to find only that the defendant \\"intentionally exercised dominion over the property.\\" Id. at 238. Thus, the jury was permitted to find the defendant guilty solely on the basis of his having taken government property. They need not have found, and were not entitled to consider, any belief he may have had with respect to the abandonment of the bomb casings - that is, whether it was government property (which is clearly defined by the plain language of the statute as a crime), or abandoned property (which is not a crime). Were this reading of the statute correct, Congress would have created a strict liability crime. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower court. However, the Supreme Court, as final arbiter of federal law, heard an appeal and reversed the decision of the trial court, concluding that the defendant must be proven to have had knowledge of the facts that made the conversion wrongful, that is, that the property had not been abandoned by its owner. Justice Robert Jackson, writing for a unanimous Court, emphasized the importance of individual criminal intent (mens rea) in the Anglo-American legal tradition, stating famously that crime was \\"generally constituted only from concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand.\\"342 U.S. 246, 251. At the same time, the Morissette opinion acknowledges that the category of criminal legislation encompassing the statute in question must be distinguished from a different category of criminal statutes applicable to public welfare offenses. The Court notes that public welfare offenses, unlike common law crimes, do not intrinsically involve harm to the State, persons, property, or public morals, but are typified only by \\"neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty.\\"Id. at 255.

Smith also told the NME that he felt Chaos Tapes had released the wrong recording and that the 12th had seen a better performance (as quoted in the 2004 edition sleevenotes by Daryl Easlea). The recording is of only adequate sound quality and the performance is notably shoddy in places, with some songs badly fluffed by the group and even Smith making lyrical errors. However, it dated from a time when live albums by The Fall were not the regular occurrence they later became and the 4000-copy edition on Chaos Tapes was snapped up quickly. Just a few weeks later, the group released one of their most highly regarded studio albums, Hex Enduction Hour. Chaos Tapes was a short-lived imprint, specialising in live material by established punk artists and releasing exclusively on the cassette format; the inner sleeve of this release advertised previous releases by the likes of Anti-Pasti, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chelsea and G.B.H..  Reissues  The album has been issued on CD four times. It was issued via Scout Releases/Rough Trade in 1996, in the US only through Feel Good All Over in 1997 and then in 1999 through the group's own Cog Sinister imprint. On each of these occasions it was issued under the title The Legendary Chaos Tape. Castle Music restored the original title upon a further reissue in 2004 and added three more tracks taken from London performances in November 1980; \\"Cary Grant's Wedding\\", \\"Totally Wired\\" and \\"The NWRA\\". The sleeve does not identify the exact venues where these tracks were recorded. This edition was also released on vinyl by Italian label Earmark in 2005. Reception Edwin Pouncey, reviewing the album for Sounds, gave it four stars, commenting that \\"the recording quality is good, with Mark's voice predominantly up front, providing some excellent moments, notably 'New Face in Hell' where Mark's vocal is mutated into a shrieking echo spitting out the words to some crazy nightmare.\\" Ned Raggett, reviewing the 1995 CD reissue for AllMusic, gave it three stars, stating that it \\"captures more of the anti-smooth genius that was and is the Fall\\", and that it includes \\"some of the Fall's all-time best\\". A review of the 1997 CD release on the Feel Good All Over label was also given three stars by the site's Ted Mills, who stated that the \\"performance is vintage Fall\\", and called it \\"past glories covered with a patina of analog distortion\\".

Miscouche is east to the Evangeline Region, the province's largest francophone area comprising numerous Acadian settlements; 15% of Miscouche's population is considered francophone.

History  Poster for the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche in August 1884 The Second Acadian National Convention was held in Miscouche in 1884, and was attended by approximately 5,000 Acadian delegates from across the Maritimes. The Convention saw the adoption of nearly all Acadian national symbols, including the Acadian flag. Because Miscouche hosted this historic convention, it was decided in 1964 that the Acadian Museum of Prince Edward Island be constructed next to the church. The Museum has been housed in a much larger facility since 1991 (still located on the same location as the former museum) and since 1996 it has served as one of the seven sites of Museum & Heritage Prince Edward Island, a division of the provincial Department of Community, Cultural Affairs and Labour. St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church is one of the oldest wooden churches in Prince Edward Island. It features a historic Casavant organ. Extensive renovations were completed in recent years to restore much of the previous grandeur of the building.  Education  Miscouche Consolidated School was established in 1977.

He was also an award-winning educator and lecturer on the Holocaust. Life He witnessed the murders of friends and family, the people they were staying with, and some of his extended family, at a dinner table by the Gestapo. He was sent to nine concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland. Amazingly, he survived. At age 13, he was a fighter with Soviet partisans. Faber recalls seeing many horrible actions in the concentration camps, ranging from seeing a baby thrown into an oven to losing every friend he made in camp. Faber also recalls the horrors of seeing most of his family dead. He remembers how an Italian friend named Finci ran into his father's arms and his father was shot right then (in front of him). When he was liberated from Bergen-Belsen in 1945, he was 18 years old and weighed 72 pounds. Faber says \\"I was a living skeleton\\". He said he could not resist anymore, and as soon as he was liberated he gave up on living. He was found at the side of a road and taken to a hospital. After the war, Faber moved to England to live with his sister Rachel (the only other survivor of his immediate family) and worked as a pastry chef in London, including at the House of Commons. During that period, he married his first wife, Tonia, and had a son, Solomon. In the 1950s, he moved to the United States, working as a pastry chef in Springfield, Massachusetts, and being called to offer testimony against Nazi war criminals.

The Equality Ride is a periodic LGBT rights bus tour made for young adults and sponsored by Soulforce, a national LGBT nonprofit organization.

In 2005, he conducted trial runs at Liberty University in the spring and at the U.S. Naval Academy in the fall. At Liberty University he spoke informally to students. According to organizers, they tried without success to donate books about homosexuality to the library. Reitan said they asked the University to designate some place on campus where students could talk about being gay without fear of being expelled or having their parents informed. They were also unable to turn over to Jerry Falwell, the university's founder and chancellor, anonymous letters written, they said, by gay Liberty students. When asked about the school's policies toward gay students, a spokesman said, \\"We follow Scripture.\\"  2006 Ride  From March 10 to and April 26, 2006, a group of about 35 people all under the age of 26, half of whom were Christian,Washington Post: Michelle Boorstein, \\"A Drive for Understanding,\\" March 11, 2006, accessed March 9, 2012 went on the first Equality Ride bus tour. Inspired by the Freedom Rides of the 1960s, the Riders traveled to 19 colleges and universities, including sixteen faith-based institutions in the Christian tradition, two military academies, and one secular university with an ROTC program. Equality Ride contacted the schools in advance and, if they were unable to agree on a format for dialogue, planned to hold a demonstration. Before leaving, they met with Congressman John Lewis, a participant in the original 1961 Freedom Ride and a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). He told them: \\"My mother told me growing up, 'Don't get in the way; don't get in trouble.' I'm so glad I got in the way and got in trouble.\\" He urged the Equality Riders to \\"make good trouble.\\"Wisconsin Gazette: \\"LGBT Equality Ride begins in Philly,\\" February 28, 2012, accessed March 10, 2012 Some 35 Riders also met with officials of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities in Washington, D.C., who said they took the arrival of the Riders as a chance, according to one report, \\"to replace the stereotype of the intolerant conservative Christian with a more compassionate 'Christ-centered' response‚Äìalbeit a response that still views homosexuality as a sin.\\" Azusa Pacific University organized a program for the Riders that included a breakfast, a chapel service, and a panel discussion. In advance of their arrival, the dean of students said: \\"The conversation is coming into the open. We don't need to go into a holy huddle.\\" An official said: \\"We believe it is our responsibility as Christ-followers to demonstrate loving, scriptural treatment of our guests while maintaining an unwavering commitment to our policy statement, which prohibits homosexual activity at the university.\\" At Liberty University, Riders attempted to cross into campus property after being warned not to. Some 24 were arrested for trespass. Its president Falwell said that following the group's visit in 2005 \\"Several of the Soulforce delegation later professed faith in Christ and abandoned the homosexual lifestyle. However, it is now our firm belief that Soulforce is ... simply trying to use such encounters on Christian college campuses as a media attraction and for their ultimate purpose of fundraising.\\" The Equality Riders also rallied outside a conference of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities in Dallas on March 31. The ex-gay ministry Exodus International sent teams to some of the colleges in anticipation of the Equality Riders' visit. Its president, Alan Chambers, said Christians needed to prepare for greater activism on the part of homosexual activists, educate themselves, and then \\"go out in the public square and begin countering the lies ... with the truth.\\" At California Baptist University in early April, Riders and students challenged each other with Bible verses and their personal histories,Los Angeles Times: Arin Gencer, \\"Being Christian and Gay Aren't at Odds, Group Says,\\" April 5, 2006, accessed March 10, 2012 On April 10, Brigham Young University allowed the Equality Riders to come onto campus property and speak to students individually, but prohibited public forums or displays on campus property.

On April 14, Riders were admitted to the grounds of the United States Air Force Academy as members of the general public, allowed to access public areas, but not private housing or secured cadet areas.

Two buses visited 33 schools. One toured the eastern United States, visiting 18 schools, and the other toured the western, visiting 15 schools. Dordt College in Sioux Center, Iowa, invited Equality Riders on campus for two days of classroom presentations, dialogue, meals with students, Bible study, and community meetings. Equality Riders gave a presentation on \\"Loving Like Jesus\\" and passed out informational pamphlets titled \\"What the Bible Says and Doesn't Say About Homosexuality.\\" The Equality Riders' bus was vandalized with graffiti and the school denounced the activity and washed the graffiti off of the bus.Minnesota Independent: Andy Birkey, \\"Less Than 24 Hours Later: Soulforce Equality Ride Vandalized,\\" March 8, 2007, accessed March 9, 2012; EdgeBoston: \\"Dordt College officials apologize to harassed gay activists,\\" March 10, 2007, accessed March 9, 2012 Later in March 2007, a Baylor University official e-mailed faculty and students the day before the Riders' arrival, stating that the university would not allow a dialogue to take place on campus. Six Equality Riders were arrested by university police on charges of criminal trespass when they refused to stop chalking sidewalks with what they called \\"messages of love and hope\\". Baylor administrators said they were in violation of university policy that allows only school-affiliated organizations to write messages on sidewalks after completing an online application. In early April 2007, Bruce Voyles, Dean of Students at Covenant College, expressed disappointment that the Riders did not accept his college's guidelines for a visit. He told newspaper reporters: \\"You have to wonder if they were really interested in dialogue or were just making some sort of statement.\\" Twenty-six Riders arrived at the campus entrance and were warned by college administrators that they would be arrested if they set foot on school property. For nearly three hours, dozens of Covenant students prayed and read the Bible with the Riders and gave them boxed lunches and water. Four Equality Riders entered school property and read a statement to \\"encourage Covenant College to become an environment that reflects the wideness of God's grace and diversity of the body of Christ.\\" Dade County police arrested them on charges of criminal trespass. On April 16, 2007, the Equality Riders visited Brigham Young University-Idaho. They had been told not trespass on the school's property. Marc Stevens, a spokesman for BYU-Idaho, explained that \\"BYU-Idaho is a private university that can't be used by any outside group to advocate its position.\\" Eight Riders were peacefully arrested after attempting to enter university grounds.The Post Register (Idaho Falls): Paul Menser, \\"Gay-rights group members arrested,\\" April 4, 2007 At an earlier visit to BYU, Riders had made an issue of the school's honor code, which condemned homosexuality in general terms, including advocacy and \\"any behaviors that indicate homosexual conduct, including those not sexual in nature\\". Following the Riders' 2007 visit, the school amended the code to more clearly ban those who engaged in homosexual acts rather than those with an LGBT sexual orientation. Officials said the change was under consideration before the Riders' 2007 visit.Deseret News: Tad Walch, \\"BYU clarifies Honor Code about gay orientation,\\" April 18, 2007, accessed March 10, 2012. The revised Honor Code read: \\"Brigham Young University will respond to homosexual behavior rather than to feelings or orientation and welcomes as full members of the university community all whose behavior meets university standards.\\" At Calvin College, administrators cited Christian Reformed Church instructions to create a better understanding of homosexuality. Vice President for student life Shirley Hoogstra said: \\"We have conversations about human sexuality on campus and the Equality Ride would fit into that series of conversations. Also a hallmark of a Calvin education is that we are willing to listen to other points of view, even those with which we are in disagreement, and we also appreciate opportunities to share our points of view.\\" The school held several events in advance of the Riders' April 24 visit. Her assessment afterwards was: \\"Equality Ride reminded us that silence on issues of injustice cannot be tolerated. We stand with them on that issue. But there were also significant places where we had vigorous debate.\\"The Calvin Spark: \\"Equality Ride visits Calvin,\\" Summer 2007, accessed March 10, 2012 At Oklahoma Baptist University, five riders were arrested after attempting to enter chapel services that day to engage in dialogue with students about LGBT issues within their school and within the Christian religion. Additionally, the group tries to affect change on campus through the establishment of advocacy groups and safe places for students and non-discrimination and anti-bullying policies through the schools‚Äô administrations. The Green Book, OBU's student handbook which includes its code of student conduct, explicitly condemns homosexual relations (along with all forms of non-marital sex). While there are no possible recriminations concerning celibate homosexuals, self-avowed practicing homosexuals could undergo counseling or face probation or expulsion. During the 2006 visit, the riders promised a return visit the next year and asked OBU officials for permission to begin a forum on campus and for the ability to hand out flyers and literature. However, OBU administrators turned down all proposals and the Riders were asked not to enter campus grounds in any fashion. The Riders would be permitted to stand on the public right-of-way on MacArthur Street, which cuts through OBU's campus. According to the group's press release, \\"In addition to the harsher policy since our last visit to the OBU campus in 2006, a student‚Äôs request to include LGBT students in the university‚Äôs anti-discrimination policy was rejected this past year. The rejection came in spite of the university‚Äôs previous promise to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protected groups,\\" said Co- Director of Soulforce, Jarrett Lucas. When the five attempted to enter Raley Chapel, they were promptly detained by OBU security and later arrested by Shawnee police. Their fines were $109 each, which were paid by donations to their cause. The Riders also visited and were denied access to Central Bible College and Colorado Christian University. Later Rides The 2008 Ride included stops at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Dallas Baptist University, where a lunch and discussion were scheduled, and a dozen more.Baptist Standard: Vicki Browen, \\"Gay-rights group targets Baptist colleges, including DBU,\\" October 1, 2008, accessed March 10, 2012Edge Boston: Scott Stiffler, \\"Soulforce Rides into Dallas to promote Equality,\\" October 17, 2008, March 10, 2012 Baylor was anticipating the arrival of another Equality Ride in April 2010.

Vice president of student life Kevin Jackson: \\"Our desire is that our campus will show the care and compassion of our Christian faith. And in doing so, what we would hope is that individuals on campus would not feel compelled to protest.\\" The stop was part of a 16-college tour that included Hardin‚ÄìSimmons University and Abilene Christian University.Baylor Lariat: Laura Remson, \\"Soulforce to visit campus on Tuesday,\\" April 1, 2010, accessed March 10, 2012 The 2012 Ride was scheduled to leave from Philadelphia on March 3 and visit 12 cities.

During the moling process, a pneumatically-driven machine known as a mole forces its way through the soil along the desired path of the pipe. Moling avoids the need to dig a trench and can be used to lay water pipes and the heating coils of heat pump systems. Recently moles that are steerable have been developed allowing an operator to correct the track of the mole and to achieve curved bores. Mole The standard approach to moling is to dig a hole about 1 m square and 2 m deep. Such a hole is small enough that it can be dug by hand instead of by machine in inaccessible locations. The mole is then entered into the earth on the horizontal face at the bottom of this hole. A destination hole of similar proportions is also dug, and this is where the mole emerges. The mole itself is a steel cylinder about 60 cm long and 6 cm in diameter. It works as a pneumatic cylinder with pulsed compressed air causing the head of the mole to repeatedly hammer against the soil in front of the mole. Once the mole has passed through the earth the pipe can be pulled through the long horizontal hole.

Arashi played a vital role in World War II by inadvertently guiding US attack planes to the Japanese carrier fleet at the Battle of Midway. Arashi had become separated from the Japanese carrier force while attempting to destroy an American submarine, . Following her attacks on Nautilus, Arashi steamed at high speed to rejoin the group. All four IJN carriers were sunk by Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers of American aircraft carriers and , giving the US a decisive victory and checking Japanese momentum in the Pacific War.

They were built with four Type 96 anti-aircraft guns in two twin-gun mounts, but more of these guns were added over the course of the war. The ships were also armed with eight torpedo tubes for the oxygen- fueled Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons comprised 16 depth charges. Construction and career =Early Operations= On 3 March 1942 Arashi assisted in sinking the gunboat . =Midway= Arashi is most famous for its involvement in the Battle of Midway. Providing escort to the carrier group, the destroyer was alerted to the presence of an approaching U.S. submarine, , when a Japanese Zero fighter aircraft dived and fired machine guns at Nautilus as it came to periscope depth. Arashi spotted the encounter and began to drop depth charges. The Japanese Task force changed course while Arashi continued its attack on Nautilus. Having kept Nautilus down long enough that she no longer was a threat, the captain of Arashi finally broke off the attack and steamed north to rejoin the carrier group. As two squadrons of dive bombers from Enterprise searched above for the Japanese Task Force, Arashi was spotted making great speed to the north. The ship's speed created a long wake, which acted as a direction arrow to the American aviators, guiding them to the Japanese carriers. Meanwhile, Japanese fighter aircraft protecting the carriers had been pulled away as they all attempted to engage an incoming torpedo attack from Hornets VT-8 torpedo squad. At the moment of decision, the Japanese carriers were essentially without high air cover. This made for an uncontested approach for the American dive bombers. The Enterprise dive bombers happened to arrive over the Japanese carriers and unimpeded, scoring multiple hits on Kaga and a single hit on Akagi that doomed both ships. During the battle Arashi is known to have picked up one of the downed airman from Yorktown. He had been made to provide the Japanese with a general description of the make-up of the force they had been fighting against, the only clear description of the American carrier forces the Japanese obtained during the battle. According to Admiral Ch≈´ichi Nagumo's battle report, the airman died the day following his recovery and was buried at sea. Among other facts the Japanese learned, the report indicated the pilot had been from Chicago. This was in fact Ensign Wesley Osmus, one of the TBD pilots of VT-3. Osmus was flying the last plane in VT-3's formation, and thus was first to be attacked and destroyed as they made their approach. Osmus was picked up later on 4 June and buried 5 June. A U.S. Naval investigation after the war interviewed witnesses who reported that after his interrogation Osmus had been taken to the stern of Arashi and struck in the back of the neck with a fire axe. He clung briefly to the railing, and then was pushed overboard into the sea. An attempt was made to find the captain of Arashi (Commander Watanabe Yasumasa) and try him for war crimes, but it was discovered that he had died later in the conflict (he was Killed In Action as Commander Destroyer Division 1 aboard destroyer Numakaze on 18 December 1943), and the matter was set aside. =At the Solomon Islands= Arashi was part of a Japanese convoy that sailed through the Blackett Strait in 1943. It included fellow destroyers , , and . The convoy's lead ship, Amagiri, is famous for being the vessel to ram and sink the American patrol craft PT-109, the PT boat commanded by Lieutenant John F. Kennedy, who would survive the war and go on to become the President of the United States. On 7 August 1943, Arashi was again attempting to land reinforcements to the garrison on New Georgia island as part of a four-destroyer fast convoy when she was intercepted by a U.S. destroyer force lying in wait between Kolombangara and Vella Lavella (). The U.S. forces struck with complete surprise. Arashi along with the destroyers and were sunk by torpedoes and naval gunfire from U.S. destroyers , and in what became known as the Battle of Vella Gulf.

Biography Born Ray Tremblay in Hull, Quebec, Ray grew up across the river in Ottawa, Ontario the third of five children. Ray's two brothers, William (Billy) and Robert were younger; his two sisters, Eileen and Maureen were older. Condo taught himself to play the guitar at 11 and by the time he was 16 he had co-written and released his first recording, 'If You Only Knew' with a band in the style of the British invasion called The Peasants. Ray attended an elite vocational fine art & design high school specifically established by the Ontario Ministry of Education for those showing exceptional talent in fine art and design. An intense and rigorous 4-year program, many who started never completed the course but Ray seemed to thrive in this environment. It was during this time that his sister Eileen passed on. This shook Ray to the core but he continued on, graduating and finding himself on the road, heading west and away from Ottawa. Reaching Vancouver, Ray studied at the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design. Not feeling all that challenged by their curriculum, after one year he dropped out and found himself drawn to a world he would eventually return to for good ... music! That started with him playing bass in a Vancouver punk rock group called The Secret Vs. He left for Montreal to paint for a year, but once again got caught up in music, getting together with bassist Clive Jackson, banjoist Chris Dean, violinist Edgar Bridwell, guitarist Eric Sandmark, and drummer Peter Sandmark to form a band called Ray Condo and his Hardrock Goners, named for Hardrock Gunter, an early rock and roll musician. The Hardrock Goners performed a variety of styles, such as rockabilly, jazz, blues, country and western swing. Their first recordings appeared on the Og label's compilations, \\"It Came From Canada\\". They then established their own record label, \\"Crazy Rekkids\\". He earned the last name \\"Condo\\" from friend Regan O'Connor, who also came up with the name of the band, Ray Condo and his Hardrock Goners. In 1991, he returned to Vancouver. The Hardrock Goners toured with him for another three years, and then he and his bassist merged in with a group called The Five Star Hillbillies, to create a new group called The Ricochets, named after how much they \\"bounced around\\". They made their last album in 2000. In 2003, Condo suffered from a minor heart attack. A year later, new band member Ian Tiles found Condo dead from a heart attack in his Vancouver apartment.

Officially it is part of the larger Lakefront neighborhood, which in turn is one of Syracuse's 26 officially recognized neighborhoods. History The neighborhood sprang up as a result of the salt industry centered on Onondaga Lake in the early years of the 19th century. During the 19th century over 12 million tons of salt were produced in the area. After the Civil War, with the salt industry on the decline, Franklin Square became an automobile production area. The H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company, from which the neighborhood's name comes from, produced cars in this area from 1902 to 1934. Another prominent employer was transmission producer New Process Gear which operated multiple factories in the area before moving to the Syracuse suburb of DeWitt. Rebirth By the 1980s nearly all of Franklin Square's industry had vanished, leaving one million square feet (300,000 m¬≤) of unused space. In 1987, the Syracuse-based Pyramid Companies, which were also developing the nearby super-regional Destiny USA shopping mall, began a revitalization process. Most of the former factory space has been converted into apartments and office space. New buildings in the square's style have also been built.

Its immediate ancestors in American architecture are the Shingle style, which began the move away from Victorian ornamentation toward simpler forms; and the Prairie style of Frank Lloyd Wright. The name \\"Craftsman\\" was appropriated from furniture-maker Gustav Stickley, whose magazine \\"The Craftsman\\" was first published in 1901. The architectural style was most widely-used in small-to-medium-sized Southern California single-family homes from about 1905, so that the smaller-scale Craftsman style became known alternatively as \\"California bungalow\\". The style remained popular into the 1930s, and has continued with revival and restoration projects through present times.  Influences and Offshoots  Gamble House, an iconic American Arts and Crafts design by Greene & Greene in Pasadena, California (1908‚Äì1909). Facade of the Castle in the Clouds and lawn overlooking Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire, built 1913‚Äì1914. The Edward Schulmerich House in Hillsboro, Oregon, completed in 1915. Silk Stocking District of Talladega, Alabama. It was built in 1908. F. E. Cottrell Apartment Building in the Old West End District (Toledo, Ohio), built 1914-1915. The American Craftsman style was a 20th century American offshoot of the British Arts and Crafts movement, which began as early as the 1860s. A successor of other 19th century movements, such as the Gothic Revival and the Aesthetic Movement, the British Arts and Crafts movement was a reaction against the deteriorating quality of goods during the Industrial Revolution, and the corresponding devaluation of human labor, over- dependence on machines, and disbanding of the guild system.Suga, Yasuko (2004). \\"Art Education\\". In Adams, James Eli (ed.) Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era, vol. 1. Danbury, CT: Grolier Academic Reference. Members of the Arts and Crafts movement also balked at Victorian eclecticism, which cluttered rooms with mismatched, faux-historic goods in an attempt to convey a sense of worldliness.Anderson, Anne (2004). \\"Decorative Arts and Design\\". In Adams, James Eli (ed.) Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era, vol. 1. Danbury, CT: Grolier Academic Reference. The movement emphasized handwork over mass production, and was in some ways just as much of a social movement as it was an aesthetic one, emphasizing the plight of the industrial worker and equating moral rectitude with the ability to create beautiful but simple things. These social currents can especially be seen in the writings of John Ruskin and William Morris, both highly influential thinkers for the movement.Anderson, Anne (2004). \\"Arts and Crafts Movement\\". In Adams, James Eli (ed.) Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era, vol. 1. Danbury, CT: Grolier Academic Reference. In addition, adherents sought to elevate the status of art forms that had here-to-for been seen as a mere trade and not fine art.Anderson, Anne (2004). \\"Arts and Crafts Movement\\". In Adams, James Eli (ed.) Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era, vol. 1. Danbury, CT: Grolier Academic Reference. The American movement also reacted against the eclectic Victorian \\"over-decorated\\" aesthetic; however, the arrival of the Arts and Crafts movement in late 19th century America coincided with the decline of the Victorian era. While the American Arts and Crafts movement shared many of the same goals of the British movement, such as social reform, a return to traditional simplicity over gaudy historic styles, the use of local natural materials, and the elevation of handicraft, it was also able to innovate: unlike the British movement, which had never been very good at figuring out how to make handcrafted production scalable,Anderson, Anne (2004). \\"Arts and Crafts Movement\\". In Adams, James Eli (ed.) Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era, vol. 1. Danbury, CT: Grolier Academic Reference. American Arts and Crafts designers were more adept at the business side of design and architecture, and were able to produce wares for a staunchly middle class market. Gustav Stickley, in particular, hit a chord in the American populus with his goal of ennobling modest homes for a rapidly expanding American middle class, embodied in the Craftsman Bungalow style. In architecture, reacting to both Victorian architectural opulence and increasingly common mass-produced housing, the style incorporated a visibly sturdy structure of clean lines and natural materials. The movement's name American Craftsman came from the popular magazine, The Craftsman, founded in October 1901 by philosopher, designer, furniture maker, and editor Gustav Stickley. The magazine featured original house and furniture designs by Harvey Ellis, the Greene and Greene company, and others. The designs, while influenced by the ideals of the British movement, found inspiration in specifically American antecedents such as Shaker furniture and the Mission Revival Style, and the Anglo-Japanese style. Emphasis on the originality of the artist/craftsman led to the later design concepts of the 1930s Art Deco movement. The architect and designer Frank Lloyd Wright, himself a member of the Chicago Arts and Crafts Society, was inspired by the style to become an innovator in the Prairie School of architecture and design, which shared many common goals with the Arts and Crafts movement.  The Boston Society of Arts and Crafts  The Arts and Crafts Movement first emerged in the United States in Boston in the 1890s. The area was very receptive to the ideas of the Arts and Crafts movement due to prominent thinkers like the transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Harvard Art History professor Charles Eliot Norton, who was a personal friend of British Art and Crafts leader William Morris.Meister, M. (2014). An intellectual stew: Emerson, Norton, Brandeis. Arts and crafts architecture: History and heritage in New England. Retrieved from https://ebookcentral.proquest.com The movement began with the first American Arts and Crafts Exhibition organized by the printer Henry Lewis Johnson in April 1897 at Copley Hall, featuring over 1,000 objects made by designers and craftspeople. The exhibition's success led to the formation of the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts in June 1897 with Charles Eliot Norton as president. The society aimed to \\"develop and encourage higher standards in the handicrafts.\\" Miller, J. (2017). Miller's Arts and Crafts: Living with the Arts and Crafts Style. London, Octopus Publishing. The Society focused on the relationship of artists and designers to the world of commerce, and on high- quality workmanship. The Society of Arts and Crafts mandate was soon expanded into a credo which read: The society held its first exhibition in 1899 at Copley Hall. Notable Craftsman designers In Southern California, the Pasadena-based firm Greene and Greene was the most renowned practitioner of the original American Craftsman Style. Their projects for Ultimate bungalows include the Gamble House and Robert R. Blacker House in Pasadena, and the Thorsen House in Berkeley‚Äîwith numerous others in California. Other examples in the Los Angeles region include the Arts and Crafts Lummis House by Theodore Eisen and Sumner P. Hunt, along the Arroyo Seco, in Highland Park, California and the Journey House, located in Pasadena. Merrill Hall at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, one of the buildings designed by Julia Morgan. Completed in 1928. In Northern California, architects renowned for their well planned and detailed projects in the Craftsman style include Bernard Maybeck, with the Swedenborgian Church, and Julia Morgan, with the Asilomar Conference Grounds and Mills College projects. Many other designers and projects represent the style in the region. In San Diego, California, the style was also popular. Architect David Owen Dryden designed and built many Craftsman California bungalows in the North Park district, now a proposed Dryden Historic District. The 1905 Marston House of George Marston in Balboa Park was designed by local architects Irving Gill and William Hebbard. In the early 1900s, developer Herberg J. Hapgood built numbers of Craftsman-style homes, many from stucco, that comprise the lakeside borough of Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. Residents were called \\"Lakers.\\" The homes followed signature styles, including bungalows and chalets. Hapgood eventually went bankrupt. Built in 1913‚Äì14 by architect J. Williams Beal in the Ossipee Mountains of New Hampshire, Tom and Olive Plant's mountaintop estate, Castle in the Clouds also known as Lucknow, is an example of the American Craftsman style in New England.Cahn, Lauren.

He currently lives in Philadelphia, PA. Simon curated exhibitions in museums and art spaces in Tel Aviv-Yafo, NYC, Melbourne, London, Z√ºrich, Vienna, Berlin, and Amsterdam, among other places. Simon is former director and chief curator at MoBY-Museums of Bat Yam, Israel (2012- 2017), which made him the youngest museum director in the history of the country. Co-founding editor of the Tel Aviv-Yafo based Maayan publishing together with Roy Chicky Arad. His writing has been taught among other places at the Royal College of Art London, UK, Northwestern University Chicago, US, and the Oslo National Academy of the Arts Norway. Art Installation view of The Unreadymade Simon began curating in his rooftop apartment which he named The Free Academy Pavilion of Art, on Jaffa Rd. 3, Tel Aviv. The debut exhibition, I Slept With Ari Libsker (2001), gained mythical stature as several artists in it went on to become prominent cultural figures in the city and worldwide, namely Roee Rosen, Zoya Cherkassky and Roy Chicky Arad. Simon is signed as curator on some seminal exhibitions in the Israeli art scene and internationally. In 2004 he curated Sharon, an exhibition which is considered the first to introduced a class reading to the imagery of the Occupation. In 2007, at the age of 28, Simon curated The Rear - The First Herzliya Biennial for Contemporary Art, which was a multi-venue art event at the Herzliya Museum of Art and in non-art spaces around the coastal city, with new works commissioned from 75 artists. That same year Simon co- curated with Maayan Strauss and Roy Chicky Arad the exhibition Doron, around a key Israeli collector Doron Sabag, and the relation of him being a key donor to museums to his business in human resources and the deteriorating workers rights in the local labor market. It has been argued that the fact that Sabag is on the board of directors of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, blocked Simon from being seriously considered for the position of chief curator at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art a decade later. In 2012 Simon curated together with Roy Chicky Arad and Ari Libsker the exhibition Iran in opposition to Israeli government plans to go to war with Iran. Simon headed the theory studies at the Postgraduate program, Hamidrasha School of Art, Beit Berl College, which he helped to set up (2009-2014). During his tenure at MoBY - Musesums of Bat Yam, Simon initiated an international programming with group and solo-shows which traveled around the world. As director of MoBY, Simon put special emphasis on expanding outreach programs, developing funding options and facilities and cataloging the museum's collection. Simon has worked with artists, writers and curators such as Hito Steyerl, Anri Sala, Anna Witt, Thomas Galler, Cristina Garrido, Nicole Wermers, Micah Hesse, Ohad Meromi, Olaf Nicolai, Francesco Finizio, Mika Rotenberg, Keren Cytter, Ari Libsker, Nimrod Kamer, Maayan Strauss, Vincent Vulsma, Harald Thys and Jos de Gruyter, Ekaterina Degot, Boyan, Elisheva Levy, Ariella Azoulay, Jan Verwoert, Ingo Niermann, Kerem Halbrecht, Lara Favaretto, Irit Rogoff, Caterina Riva, Omer Fast, Joseph Grima, Noam Yuran, Jodi Dean, Noa Yafe, Bini Adamczak, Slavoj Zizek, Aim Deuelle Luski, Michael E.

His writing has been published in a wide range of publications: Springerin, Frieze, Afterall, Domus International, Modern Painters, Temporary Art Review, Artpress, Mousse Magazine, Art Actuel, e-flux journal, Public Seminar and Israeli Art magazine Studio. Simon is a fellow at the Vera List Center for Art and Politics, The New School, New York (2011-2013), and the Akademie de K√ºnst der Welt, Cologne (2017). = Neomaterialism = The book Neomaterialism (2013), examines the meaning of materialism today, as materiality has been supposedly defeated by financial and digital operations. Since the so-called dematerialization of currencies and art practices in the late 1960s and early 1970, we have witnessed several shifts the book claims: the focus of labor has moved from production to consumption, the commodity has become the historical subject, and symbols now behave like materials (brands etc.). Neomaterialism explores the meaning of the world of commodities, and reintroduces various notions of dialectical materialism into the conversation on the subjectivity and vitalism of things. At the height of the influence of Object Oriented Ontology and speculative realism in contemporary art circles, the book provided a much needed critique of these trends of re-fetishization and de-contextualization. Putting debt at the center of the contemporary experience, the book explores our material culture following the 2008 crisis and the attempts to secure the art market. Simon put forward several concept in the book, such as the unreadymade, sentimental value, and the promise of the dividual as a means for a vocabulary in this new economy of meaning. Reflecting on the general intellect as labor and the subjugation of an overqualified generation to the neo-feudal order of debt finance ‚Äî with a particular focus on dispossession and rent economy, post-appropriation display strategies and negation, the barricade and capital's technocratic fascisms‚ÄîNeomaterialism merges traditions of epic communism with the communism that is already here. Reception Neomaterialism has been taught in several art programs around the world, and generated several reading groups in Europe, the UK and the US. Among the reactions to it Boris Groys wrote: ‚ÄúAfter a short period of ‚Äòunbearable lightness of being,‚Äô the social gravitation begins to be felt again. In his book Joshua Simon describes and analyzes the growing weight of the technical, economic, material basis of our society. The author's sensibility for today's Zeitgeist is at the same time entertaining and precise.‚Äù Jan Verwoert, wrote for Frieze Magazine: ‚ÄúIn his new book Neomaterialism, Joshua Simon perceptively argues that debt is the crux of the matter. Credit card purchases and mortgage settlements may feel abstract at first. But debt brings its material truth home to you: you do not own that new computer, TV, car or flat; they own you.‚Äù Pelin Tan wrote in Domus Magazine: ‚ÄúNeomaterialism is a book that prevents us to fall into the pessimism of perceiving the thought of new materialism as a minimalist approach as well as to reconsider our practice as curators, architects and artists in a transversal way in order to create a further criticism not only of the modernist but also post-structuralist heritages of representation and subject-object relations.‚Äù And Louis Moreno wrote in Onlineopen.org: ‚ÄúPerhaps Simon‚Äôs book represents a new form of guide to contemporary art. This is art as diagnostic toolkit, able to decipher the complex threats that lurk within the fixtures and fittings of everyday life [‚Ä¶] Simon‚Äôs implicit suggestion that neomaterialist art embodies an auto- critique of financialised capitalism is fascinating.‚Äù The book had numerous print runs. = The New and Bad Art Gallery = In the summer of 2007 Simon and Arad opened together with artist Maayan Strauss The New and Bad Art Gallery in Tel Aviv, which presented a line-up of debut solo exhibitions by young female artists (Eden Bannet, Inbal Strauss, Noa Tsaushu, Oren Ben Moreh, Efrat Kedem and Fumio Sakurai), with two male exceptions (Nimrod Kamer and Know Hope). Initially planned to operate for six months, the gallery re-opened after a few months in Haifa under the directorship of Natalie Levin, and operated there for two years. = Notable concepts = Simon's work is often identified with several concepts - *The Curatorial *Unreadymade *The Overqualified *Dividual *Mesoscopic *Metastability  Publishing and Film  Since the late 1990s, Simon has been working closely with poet and writer Roy Chicky Arad on a number of initiatives in Tel Aviv. Together they founded The University of Shenkin and The Free Academy (for which Simon opened the Art Pavilion in his apartment), two platforms of nomadic study that were hosted by art schools and art festivals, theatres and schools. Out of these initiatives came out a travelling poetry reading program that Simon and Arad initiated, which in turn morphed into Guerilla Culture ‚Äì a platform of poets and activists who organized poetry demonstrations and publications throughout the 2000s. Parallel to these projects in poetry, since the 2000 Simon has been writing and directing short films as a member of the group of filmmakers Baboon, together with Tom Shoval, Daniel Adar, Michael Hanegbi, Adam Sanderson and Oren Shay. Simon's films were shown among other places on Arte/ZDF, Israeli channel 1 and channel 2, and in Anthology Film Archives, NYC, and in The Berlinale Film Festival, Mar Del Plata, Argentina, Rencontres Internationales Paris and Berlin, FIDMarseille France, Oberhausen IFF Germany, INVIDEO and Milan Short Film Festival, among other places. For his film The Radicals (2001), Simon was awarded The Jerusalem Cinematheque Award for Young Filmmaker. In 2005 Simon and Arad formed Maayan Publishing, which publishes Maayan Magazine for Poetry, Literature and Ideas which they co-edit; Western (Maarvon) ‚Äì New Film Magazine (which Simon edits); The New and Bad Contemporary Art Magazine (which they edit together with Natalie Levin); and a series for poetry books and original theatre plays. Simon is the author of the poetry book National Citizens. In the first issue of Maayan he published a list called \\"The Prince\\", exploring his life and views on the world from A to Z. Since then he wrote essays for the magazine and translated for it songs by Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger among others. Simon translated Mierle Landerman Ukeles ‚ÄúMaintenance Art Manifesto‚Äù (1969) into Hebrew on its 40th anniversary for The New and Bad Contemporary Art Magazine =Maarvon (Western) ‚Äì New Film Magazine= Originally, Maarvon was intended as an extended supplement to Maayan Magazine dedicated to cinema and film, but eventually it grew to become an independent film magazine. On its board are key filmmakers, programmers and scholars such as Dan Shadur, Adam Aboulafia, Laliv Melamed, Dani Rosenberg, Nimrod Kamer, Ari Libsker, Tom Shoval, and Karin Rywkind Segal. The magazine also included a column by artist and filmmaker Roee Rosen (issues 1-6). While expanding the writing on contemporary cinema in Hebrew, the magazine made it its goal to look carefully into Israeli film history and present, with essays on sub-genres and rediscovered figures, funding conditions and theoretical blind spots, films by female filmmakers, overview of themes and styles. In recent issues the magazine has been focusing more and more on the shift from montage to the digital. It has dedicated special issues to filmmakers such as Jean Luc Godard, Alexander Kluge, Hito Steyerl, Harun Farocki and others, as they have portrayed the shift from visualising the totality of the social through montage to an exploration of the totality of capital in the digital. Parallel to these filmmakers, the magazine highlighted the work of Albert Serra, Jia Zhangke, Amos Guttman, Abderrahmane Sissako, Scandar Copti, Lisandro Alonso, Barry Jenkins, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Keren Yedaya, Hagar Ben-Asher, Pedro Costa, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Avi Mograbi, Peter Watkins, Roberto Rossellini, Sasha Grey, Russ Meyer, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Miguel Gomes, Du≈°an Makavejev, Mat√≠as Pi√±eiro, Ellida Geira, Kendrick Lamar, Claire Denis, Michal Bat-Adam. Simon also contributed to the magazine essays on Israeli cinema, on finance and psychosis, and on contemporary romantic comedies of the 2000s and Bromance movies, among other subjects. =Journalism= In the media magazine Firma (a supplement of Globes Financial News), Simon has published articles from 2000-2009 on various issues. Simon contributed to the culture section of the daily newspaper Globes with art reviews and interviews and was the newspaper's art critic and contributor to the paper's Op-Eds. In Firma, Simon served as editorial board member, ran a column ‚ÄúReading the News‚Äù which was a focused on media critique, interviewed key figures of the local political scene such as Benjamin Netanyahu (Minister of Finance at the time), Ehud Olmert (Minister of Industry, Trade and Labor at the time), Avigdor Lieberman (Minister of Strategic Affairs at the time), Amir Peretz (Chairman of the General Organization of Workers in Israel at the time), Akiva Orr (key political figure of anti-Zionist Left in Israel since the 1960s), Shimshon Bichler (world renowned scholar of the political economy of Israel's military-financial complex), filmmaker Menachem Golan, as well as International philosopher Slavoj Zizek and many others. In addition, from 2005-2009 Simon ran a weekly column in the now mythological metro weekly Ha-Ir (the Tel Aviv equivalent of The Village Voice). The column, \\"Close to Home,\\" was key to define the changes the city has undergone in its leadership's attempt to position it as a Global City. In his column, Simon observed urban developments and gentrification trends, gave voice to right to the city movements and expanded on the intertwined political and architectural meaning of public sphere.

Protein structure  p300 and CBP have similar structures. Both contain five protein interaction domains: the nuclear receptor interaction domain (RID), the KIX domain (CREB and MYB interaction domain), the cysteine/histidine regions (TAZ1/CH1 and TAZ2/CH3) and the interferon response binding domain (IBiD). The last four domains, KIX, TAZ1, TAZ2 and IBiD of p300, each bind tightly to a sequence spanning both transactivation domains 9aaTADs of transcription factor p53.The prediction for 9aaTADs (for both acidic and hydrophilic transactivation domains) is available online from ExPASy http://us.expasy.org/tools/ and EMBnet Spain In addition p300 and CBP each contain a protein or histone acetyltransferase (PAT/HAT) domain and a bromodomain that binds acetylated lysines and a PHD finger motif with unknown function. The conserved domains are connected by long stretches of unstructured linkers.  Regulation of gene expression  p300 and CBP are thought to increase gene expression in three ways: # by relaxing the chromatin structure at the gene promoter through their intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. # recruiting the basal transcriptional machinery including RNA polymerase II to the promoter. # acting as adaptor molecules. p300 regulates transcription by directly binding to transcription factors (see external reference for explanatory image). This interaction is managed by one or more of the p300 domains: the nuclear receptor interaction domain (RID), the CREB and MYB interaction domain (KIX), the cysteine/histidine regions (TAZ1/CH1 and TAZ2/CH3) and the interferon response binding domain (IBiD). The last four domains, KIX, TAZ1, TAZ2 and IBiD of p300, each bind tightly to a sequence spanning both transactivation domains 9aaTADs of transcription factor p53.; Enhancer regions, which regulate gene transcription, are known to be bound by p300 and CBP, and ChIP- seq for these proteins has been used to predict enhancers. Work done by Heintzman and colleagues showed that 70% of the p300 binding occurs in open chromatin regions as seen by the association with DNase I hypersensitive sites. Furthermore, they have described that most p300 binding (75%) occurs far away from transcription start sites (TSSs) and these binding sites are also associated with enhancer regions as seen by H3K4me1 enrichment. They have also found some correlation between p300 and RNAPII binding at enhancers, which can be explained by the physical interaction with promoters or by enhancer RNAs.  Function in G protein signaling  An example of a process involving p300 and CBP is G protein signaling. Some G proteins stimulate adenylate cyclase that results in elevation of cAMP. cAMP stimulates PKA, which consists of four subunits, two regulatory and two catalytic. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits causes release of the catalytic subunits. These subunits can then enter the nucleus to interact with transcriptional factors, thus affecting gene transcription. The transcription factor CREB, which interacts with a DNA sequence called a cAMP response element (or CRE), is phosphorylated on a serine (Ser 133) in the KID domain. This modification is PKA mediated, and promotes the interaction of the KID domain of CREB with the KIX domain of CBP or p300 and enhances transcription of CREB target genes, including genes that aid gluconeogenesis. This pathway can be initiated by adrenaline activating Œ≤-adrenergic receptors on the cell surface.  Clinical significance  Mutations in CBP, and to a lesser extent p300, are the cause of Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome, which is characterized by severe mental retardation. These mutations result in the loss of one copy of the gene in each cell, which reduces the amount of CBP or p300 protein by half. Some mutations lead to the production of a very short, nonfunctional version of the CBP or p300 protein, while others prevent one copy of the gene from making any protein at all. Although researchers do not know how a reduction in the amount of CBP or p300 protein leads to the specific features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, it is clear that the loss of one copy of the CBP or p300 gene disrupts normal development. Defects in CBP HAT activity appears to cause problems in long-term memory formation. CBP and p300 have also been found to be involved in multiple rare chromosomal translocations that are associated with acute myeloid leukemia. For example, researchers have found a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 22 (in the region containing the p300 gene) in several people with a cancer of blood cells called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Another translocation, involving chromosomes 11 and 22, has been found in a small number of people who have undergone cancer treatment. This chromosomal change is associated with the development of AML following chemotherapy for other forms of cancer. Mutations in the p300 gene have been identified in several other types of cancer. These mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. Somatic mutations in the p300 gene have been found in a small number of solid tumors, including cancers of the colon and rectum, stomach, breast and pancreas. Studies suggest that p300 mutations may also play a role in the development of some prostate cancers, and could help predict whether these tumors will increase in size or spread to other parts of the body. In cancer cells, p300 mutations prevent the gene from producing any functional protein. Without p300, cells cannot effectively restrain growth and division, which can allow cancerous tumors to form.  Mouse models  CBP and p300 are critical for normal embryonic development, as mice completely lacking either CBP or p300 protein, die at an early embryonic stage. In addition, mice which lack one functional copy (allele) of both the CBP and p300 genes (i.e. are heterozygous for both CBP and p300) and thus have half of the normal amount of both CBP and p300, also die early in embryogenesis. This indicates that the total amount of CBP and p300 protein is critical for embryo development. Data suggest that some cell types can tolerate loss of CBP or p300 better than the whole organism can. Mouse B cells or T cells lacking either CBP and p300 protein develop fairly normally, but B or T cells that lack both CBP and p300 fail to develop in vivo. Together, the data indicate that, while individual cell types require different amounts of CBP and p300 to develop or survive and some cell types are more tolerant of loss of CBP or p300 than the whole organism, it appears that many, if not all cell types may require at least some p300 or CBP to develop.

It is from the capital Cagliari and from the railway station at San Gavino Monreale. Close to Guspini, at the mines of Montevecchio and Gennamari, galena and sphalerite were extracted in the past. Today the people at Guspini are concentrated on agriculture, on tourism and on smaller to middle enterprises. Close to Guspini are some well-built nuraghes and the Phoenician-Punic archaeological site of Neapolis.  History  The first traces of human settlement in the area of Guspini trace back to prior the Nuragic period. Traces of Nuragic, Phoenician-Punic, Bizantine and Roman settlements have been found. The town has a medioeval structure with the Church of Santa Maria of Malta which was founded by the knights of the same order, as the most ancient trace. In the Middle Ages the town was part of the Giudicato of Arborea, whose rulers possessed a castle on a nearby mount built in 1100, on the Mount Arcuentu. From the 19th century Guspini's history was strictly linked to the mines of Montevecchio.

Background The Kager≈ç-class destroyers were outwardly almost identical to the preceding light cruiser- sized , with improvements made by Japanese naval architects to improve stability and to take advantage of Japan's lead in torpedo technology. They were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and in both day and night attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun . Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, only one survived the Pacific War.Globalsecurity.org, IJN Kagero class destroyers Hayashio, built at the Uraga Dock Company, was laid down on 30 June 1938, launched on 19 April 1939 and commissioned on 31 August 1940. Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hayashio, was assigned to Destroyer Division 15 (Desdiv 15), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 2 (Desron 2) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had deployed from Palau, as part of the escort for the aircraft carrier in the invasion of the southern Philippines and minelayer . In early 1942, Hayashio participated in the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, escorting the invasion forces for Menado, Kendari and Ambon in January, and the invasion forces for Makassar, Timor and Java in February. At the end of March, she returned with from Staring-baai in Sulawesi to Sasebo. At the end of April, Hayashio deployed from Kure to assist in the occupation of the Cagayan Islands near Palawan in early May, and then returned with the damaged carrier from Manila to Kure on 17 May. In early June, Hayashio deployed from Saipan as part of the troopship escort for the Battle of Midway. In mid-June, Hayashio was assigned as escort for cruisers in projected further Indian Ocean raids, but the operation was cancelled by the time she reached Mergui in Burma, and she was reassigned as escort for the cruisers and to Balikpapan and the Solomon Islands. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons of 24 August she was part of Admiral Kond≈ç's Advance Force, but was not in combat. During September, Hayashio was used for patrols between Truk and Guadalcanal, and in October began operations as a \\"Tokyo Express\\" high speed troop transport to Guadalcanal. These operations continued to early-February 1943. During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October, she was assigned to the escort if the aircraft carrier , returning after the battle with cruisers and to Shortland Island. During the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13‚Äì15 November, Hayashio served as flagship of the troop convoy escorts. After the battle, she returned with Maya, Suzuya and to Kavieng. On 24 November 1942, while on a transport run to Lae, Hayashio was attacked by USAAF bombers and caught fire. Attempts to quench the fires stopped after the magazine exploded, and Cdr Kiyoshi Kaneda gave the order to abandon ship. After removing the survivors, she was scuttled by a torpedo launched by the destroyer , in Guna Bay, Huon Gulf (). Hayashio was removed from the navy list on 24 December 1942.

The common goal of all these organizations was to \\"keep alive the ideals of July 18th 1936 and to gather the national forces.\\"  Founding  FN appeared as the collective leader in 1966 around Fuerza Nueva Editorial SA, a magazine of the same name beginning to be published in 1967. From the beginning, their public call was to the most nostalgic Falangists and to those in favor of hardening the repression. After a spiritual retirement, Pi√±ar, director of the magazine, organized and constituted in 1976 the only openly extreme right-wing party represented in the new Spanish democracy. It was Pi√±ar and other seven other nostalgic fascists, headed by the general and member of Opus Dei Alvaro Lacalle Leloup. They pleaded for the continuation of Francoism in all its forms, without clarifying if its position was one of Falangism, Carlism, the Opus Dei technocracy that had dominated the later days of Francoist Spain, or all of them simultaneously. The only clear position was its rejection of Juan Carlos's constitutional monarchy and its defense of \\"organic democracy\\". Because of this, FN was an amalgam of Catholic fundamentalists, technocrats, neoliberal-raised young people, fascists and ultranationalists, in which any rightist idea had relevance and that called itself a \\"national group of forces\\". In 1977 it failed totally in the elections with the coalition 'National Alliance July 18', an organization that included FN, FE-JONS (the Falange) and the Carlist Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista. In 1979, they repeated the previous coalition with the new name National Union, and Pi√±ar was elected as deputy of Madrid. The parliamentary interventions of Blas Pi√±ar were centred in this period on his own party, most of the time talking about the actions against his group, trying to criminalize antifascist activity and even obtaining propaganda of the formation of these frequent denunciations, appearing as a victim like a group persecuted by the Department of the Interior. According to other references of this period, they talked about the political conjuncture, the rest of the time suggesting dirty plots of the State and the autonomous governments.  From the 1980s till today  In any case, the defined political group best known as a last holdout of the regime disappeared officially as a party in 1982, becoming restricted by constant losses to only publishing. None of its leaders knew how to admit the loss of its parliamentary representation when it only obtained 0.13% of the vote (20,139 ballots), or why internal fights aggravated the FN crisis and sparked the appearance of a breakaway movement that culminated in the creation of Hispanic Union (UH). FN is since then only a testimonial extreme right-wing magazine of little influence directed by Luis Fernandez Villamea. Present in all the Spanish provinces during the transition to democracy, its message was one of fear to a subversion against Spain organized by the \\"interests of the Judeo-Masonic and communist hydra\\". The work of FN in favor of anti-Marxist and racist propaganda began in 1970 with the publication in its own publishing house of the book What is Communism?, although several other books had to do with previous conferences on the matter where socialism was explained from the ultra-Catholic view as an ideology inspired by the devil. It did not have any revisions explaining the certain falseness of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion nor in the introducing part of the Literature of the Holocaust, and based all its propaganda on the defense of the National-Catholic values urging \\"A New Crusade by the Mother country\\". FN, implicated in political aggression and attacks to bookstores, created a youthful pick up group called Fuerza Joven (Young Force). Through it, they passed numerous leaders of later attempts of neofascist unification like Jose Luis Corral, leader of the Spanish Catholic Movement, or Ricardo S√°enz de Ynestrillas, founder and ex-leader of \\"Alliance for National Unity\\". Years later, FN reappeared refounded as Forward Spain (ADES). Also directed by Blas Pi√±ar, ADES maintained the same goals as the political project of FN, that is to say, the resurrection of the form of the authoritarian state dictatorship from 1939 to 1975. As years passed for New Force, the new project of Blas Pi√±ar was repudiated by most of the neo-Nazi groups, especially skinheads. Nevertheless, its calls to take the streets in the occasion of celebrations like 20 November (the anniversary of the deaths of Francisco Franco and of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera) generally are seconded by most militants of the extreme right, including during the 1980s and 1990s numerous skinheads as well as fascist supporters of the older generations.

The species has an average weight of 2-3 kilograms and an average length of 76 centimeters. The record length has been recorded at 102 centimeters. Description Color is variable, from light steel-gray to almost jet black in the spring. The fish is streamlined, with an inferior mouth and a small/slender head that tapers to a fleshy snout. The mouth location allows the fish to feed off the bottom of its habitat. The body of this fish is elongated and slightly compressed. It has a long falcate dorsal fin which is elevated anterior with 24-35 rays. It has a long caudal peduncle and a forked caudal fin. The anal fin contains 7-8 rays on average. The scales are large and contain 55-58 along the lateral line. Inferiorly positioned sucker mouth Range and distribution The Blue Sucker is native to the United States and Mexico. In the U.S., it lives in the Mississippi River basin north to Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Blue Sucker also lives in the Missouri River drainage to North Dakota and South Dakota and Montana. This species can also be found in the Gulf drainage from the Sabine River to the Rio grande. Habitat Huge migrations of these fast, powerful fish once migrated throughout the Mississippi River basin, and spring harvests of blue sucker were a staple food for early pioneers. Blue suckers are very rare today, thought to be due to the segmentation of habitat caused by the thousands of dams which have been built in the last century. Blues frequent the thalweg of large river systems, in heavy current. Diet Blue suckers obtain their food off the bottom of rivers and other bodies of freshwater through a mouth in the inferior position. Some organisms that they eat are aquatic insect larvae, crustaceans, plant materials and algae. Reproduction The Blue Sucker has a spawning time from around March until June. This varies on the location of the fish and also the water temperature. Fifty-three degrees is the average water temperature in which males and females find their spawning area. This area is in fast moving water around two feet deep. Rocks in the area will also be larger than gravel, but they will be smaller than boulders. The peak water temperature is sixty-two degrees and the actual spawning time will usually last around two weeks. Male suckers will continue to come to the area until spawning is officially over. Females will go to the area, lay her eggs, and leave once she is finished and they have been fertilized. Conservation The Blue Sucker is sensitive to water pollution, and is only able to live in water that is well irrigated or pollution-less. This is why it is common to see them in rivers. The species is listed as least concern. Trivia The Blue Sucker also goes by the name blackhorse, the bluefish, the muskellunge, the razor back, the sockerel, the gourd seed sucker, the Missouri Sucker, the slenderhead sucker, and the sweet sucker. Etymology \\"Cycleptus\\" is a Greek word meaning circular or slender. \\"Elongatus\\" is a Latin word meaning elongated.

Its population is 330 (1990), increasing to 397 at the 2011 Census. There has been a settlement on the site of the present day Bredhurst since neolithic times because of fertile fields and the good wood supply. The village is quite close to the M2 motorway but retains a traditional feel. Bredhurst is centred on The Bell Inn and Bredhurst Church of England primary school. The first dates from the Tudor period, the latter was founded in 1866. The school averages just over 125 pupils with about sixteen pupils per year. Every year on or about the first Saturday of May, Bredhurst School holds its annual mayday celebration. This event is marked by Maypole dancing, the crowning of the May Queen, the pageant of Saint George and the dragon, a procession, and many stalls. The procession starts at Abbots Court farm and ends at Bredhurst School, down the street. The traffic is stopped and the whole village is decked in bunting and banners. Bredhurst manor dates from the time of King Edward III. It was bought by John of Gaunt in 1379 before King Richard II gave it to Simon de Burley in 1384. Burley lost the manor when he was accused of high treason in 1390. By 1551, Sir Thomas Cheney was owner of the manor, followed by the Kemsley family later in the 16th century. Isabel Kemsley stipulated that her son John should hold 'a drinking' in the village on All Saints' Day and this tradition continued until the 19th century, when it was replaced with the more popular mayday celebrations. The 19th century owners of the manor were the Romilly family, terminating when it was sold by the widow of the fourth Baron Romilly, William Guy Gospard Romilly (who died in 1983). It was later bought by a family who do not have a title, who sold most of the grounds off. St Peter's church at Bredhurst is situated in woodland separate to the village. Typical of downland flint churches, it combines its 13th-century origins with 19th-century additions including a small bellcote with two bells. There is a small graveyard. Inside the church are a number of memorials to people who died in the first and second world wars. During the 16th century Reformation the treasures of the church were hidden by the incumbent and his parishioners and have never been found. The treasure included a golden chalice and the golden altar plate. The famous Bredhurst paten, which held the communion bread, was found and restored in 1907. It is made of copper and was originally gilded, and dates from 1180-1260. It is one of only four known to be in existence and all the others were found in the graves of bishops or archbishops. The paten is said to be priceless and is kept at the Victoria & Albert Museum as part of their \\"sacred silver\\" collection. Bredhurst was largely untouched during the blitz and the whole Second World War, however in 1939 evacuation began; the evacuees went to Bredhurst School. Today most of Bredhurst is still made up of farms and woodland, these include Abbots Court farm, Aaron Bank farm and Grange farm. It was reported that there are more livestock living in Bredhurst than people. Bredhurst School Bredhurst School was built in 1867 during the later part of the victorian era. In the log book of Bredhurst school the rural dean was reported to say \\"I am glad to find that a very good school has been built which is of great advantage to the Parish and of material benefit to the rising generation.‚Äù The school was typically Victorian with high windows in the schoolroom to avoid distractions to pupils, a central stove to provide heating and the Schoolmistress' accommodation adjoining. The earliest log book shows that Mrs S.Belcher was Headmistress and was supported by two assistant mistresses and the Vicar who lived in the Rectory, an imposing edifice which stood where Fir Tree Grove is now situated. The curriculum differed greatly from today's and included drill for the boys, knitting and needlework for the girls, recitations and object lessons on subjects as diverse ‚ÄúThe Tongue of a Bee‚Äù and ‚ÄúDairying and Cattle Feeding.‚Äù These object lessons were sometimes given by the Managers of the School or the Vicar and were illustrated by lantern slides. Bredhurst has always been a Church school and as such the regular three-hour Scripture lessons were very important. The Vicar attends very frequently to teach the children Bible stories, Catechisms and Psalms. Many of the issues faced by the Victorian school remain the same today; financial restraints, heating, maintenance, behavioural problems, visits from the School (nit) Nurse, dentist etc., etc. In those days, however, there were more holidays in which to recover the equilibrium. There were holidays to accommodate hop picking, fruit picking, harvesting, Ascension Day, Whitsun, Empire Day, Independence Day, school treats/picnics, Sunday school outings, choir outings, Bank holidays, all ‚ÄòRoyal' events and even ‚Äòwhim' holidays granted at the Managers discretion! All these in addition to the regular Christmas, Easter and summer holidays! Today however there are holidays for christmas, summer and easter as well as may day and half term breaks. Over the years the school has had a varied career, apart from being an educational establishment it has also served as a billet for soldiers during World War I, polling station, parish meeting place and evening school. A special meeting of the parish took place in June 1903 to appoint Mr H Chapman as Manager for the School for a period of three years. The school also housed a museum with various exhibits originating from the Victorian era which were used extensively during object lessons. The police were in attendance regularly on Saturdays from 1913 in order to issue pig licences. Parishioners gathered in the schoolroom in 1919 in order to organise a 'Peace Celebration' for the village in the form of a cricket match, a fair and tea on 19 July 1919 on the village green. There were very few changes or structural improvements made to the school until after World War II.

Early life and education A native of Chicago, Illinois, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where, in 1937 and 1938, he was the city editor of the Daily Illini, the independent student-run newspaper. Career From 1951 to 1966, Connolly was a gossip columnist for The Hollywood Reporter, a daily entertainment newspaper dealing with film and television productions, located in Los Angeles, California. The screenplay for the biographical film I'll Cry Tomorrow (1955) was based on the autobiography of the same name by actress Lillian Roth, that was written in collaboration with Connolly and Gerold Frank. He was described by Newsweek as \\"probably the most influential columnist inside the movie colony,\\" the one writer \\"who gets the pick of trade items, the industry rumors, the policy and casting switches.\\" Indeed, he was a witness to, and participant, in more than a decade of sometimes tumultuous Hollywood history, and he was privy to most of Hollywood's secrets during those years. Actress and writer Shirley MacLaine devoted several pages in her first memoir, Don't Fall Off the Mountain (1970), to an incident in which she had marched into the offices of The Hollywood Reporter and punched Connolly in the mouth. She was angry about what he had said about her career in his column. The incident garnered a headline on the cover of the New York Post on June 11, 1963. The full story appeared on page 5 under the headline ‚ÄúShirley Delivers A Punchy Line.‚Äù The reporter's byline was Bernard Lefkowitz. Personal life Connolly was also known for his 1937-38 crusade against prostitution in Champaign, Illinois, and later for his battle against communism in Hollywood. According to his biographer, Val Holley, these campaigns were attempts by Connolly, who was a homosexual, to feel part of the mainstream.

The site is on low-lying land between the Lincoln Edge and the River Witham. Although Somerton Castle is in the parish of Boothby Graffoe, it is in the Manor of Waddington and this portion is often referred to as the Manor of Somerton Castle. Antony Bek probably built the castle in 1281 and he gave it to King Edward II in 1309. King John II of France was imprisoned at Somerton Castle between 1359 and 1360, having been taken prisoner after the Battle of Poitiers. It continued as crown property until it was sold by Charles I in 1628, since when the castle has continued in private ownership.\\"Colvin\\" (1963), 838-9 Medieval history Antony Bek inherited Somerton from his mother, Eva de Gray, and built the castle after being granted a licence to crenellate in 1281.\\"Colvin\\" (1963), 838. In 1309 Bek gave the castle as a gift to King Edward II. The castle was found to be in poor condition at the accession of King Edward II, lead had been stolen from the towers and the great hall and the chapel, which were on the west side of the castle, were in poor repair. After the accession of Edward III in 1330, John Crabbe, a military engineer was appointed Constable of the Castle, and in autumn of 1334 King Edward visited the castle, presumably to authorise repair work. A total of ¬£222 was spent during the next two years on rebuilding the outer drawbridge and remaking part of the moat ‚Äì presumably this was the time when the outer bailey to the south of the castle was constructed. In late 1335 or early 1336 the Countess Alice de Lacy of Bolingbroke, Countess of Lincoln, was held and raped at Somerton after being kidnapped from her castle at Bolingbroke by Baron Hugh de Fresne. They married later that year, although without royal authority and so, by order of Edward III, they were held captive in separate towers in Somerton Castle. Royal assent was granted on 20 March 1336, however de Fresne died in December of 1336 and the countess Alice returned to Bolingbroke. After Crabbe's death in 1351/2, Stephen Shawe was appointed as Constable and regular repairs took place to the domestic buildings in the inner court. Further repairs and alterations took place in 1359-60 when King John II of France was held captive in the castle having been taken prisoner after the Battle of Poitiers. Sir Saier De Rochford, ancestor of the Rochford family of Stoke Rochford, \\"an eminent soldier in the wars of France,\\" and High Sheriff of Lincolnshire, was allowed two shillings a day for the safekeeping of King John while at Somerton.Turnor, Edmund; Collections for the History of the Town and Soke of Grantham Containing Authentic Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton, William Miller (1806), p. 143 By 1393 the castle was reported as being defective in walls, gates, towers , bridges, ditches, lead roofing , tiling, boarding, glazing and ironwork and would need the expenditure of ¬£100 to repair. In 1408 King Henry VI granted the castle to Sir Ralph Rochford, who was High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in that year. He was to spend ¬£112 12s. 9d on repairs during the next three years. The works carried out included making good the roof of the queen's hall, with its buttery and pantry, and repairing the chapel and chamber of St Christopher. The castle was held from the King by the Dukes of Clarence from 1415 until 1478, when George, Duke of Clarence was executed.\\"Colvin\\" (1963), 839. The castle was allowed to fall into disrepair during this period and it suffered waste, dilapidation and strip from those who held it from the King. Later history Somerton Castle, Boothby Graffoe, Lincolnshire in 1973 The Castle was transferred to the estates of the Duchy of Lancaster by Henry VII ‚ÄùColvin‚Äù, 839 and the Castle and its lands were held by De‚ÄôIsney or Disney family. A Duchy of Lancaster Survey of 1601 described the castle as being utterly defaced and fallen almost downe to the ground, but one of the four towers was standing almost to its full height. The property was bought from the Charles I in 1628 by the Corporation of the City of London and it then passed to the Hussey family. The print produced by Samuel Buck in 1726 is dedicated to Sir Henry Hussey, and this print shows the castle as in much the same state as described in 1601. Sir Henry left Somerton Castle to his aunt Jane Hatcher, who died in 1734Battersby Papers, Lincolnshire Archives and it then passed to the Pochin family of Barkby in Leicestershire, who sold the castle to Montague Cholmeley of Easton in 1780. Somerton Castle from the S.E. in 1850 The property and estate were bought from Sir Montague Cholmeley, 1st Baronet in 1812 by the Isaac Marfleet of Bassingham who had been previously leasing the castle; the property then passed on to several of the family's descendants,Battersby papers, Lincolnshire Archives until it passed to the Battersby family, who sold the castle and surrounding farmland in the mid-1970s.

Hoare, Ridge & Morris of Snape in Suffolk were commissioned as architects to draw up plans for the restoration of the castle. Planning consents were granted by North Kesteven District Council for additional building work, which included a new wing extending to the northwards behind the south front and also the conversion of the 19th-century farm buildings into dwellings.North Kesteven Planning 14/0292/FUL Architecture and visible remains Plan of Somerton Castle by J. S. Padley, 1850 Cooling Castle, Kent OS map 1964 ‚Äì for comparison with Somerton Castle. The medieval castle appears to have most in common in its plan and layout with later castles of the 14th century and early 15th century such as Maxstoke Castle in Warwickshire, Wingfield Castle in Suffolk and, in particular Cooling Castle in Kent. These castles are set in moats with roughly rectangular curtain walls between corner towers. Cooling Castle was licensed to crenellate in 1381,\\"Goodall\\", (2011), 312-3 and in front of the rectangular inner bailey is a trapezoid-shaped outer bailey with open-backed corner towers. This is the arrangement that is indicated in Padley's plan, even though the towers are shown as mounds at the corners. These open-backed artillery towers started appearing in Europe around 1330 and would have been familiar to John Crabbe, the Constable of the Castle, who came from Flanders. In these towers the artillery would be placed on two or three floors and the open backs to the towers gave ventilation from the fumes released by igniting gunpowder. This forward defence is likely to have been placed in front of the main gate to the inner bailey of Somerton Castle, and the towers would have given the artillery a sweep of about 270¬∫ to the south of the castle. Caister Castle from J. D. Mackenzie's The Castles of England: their story and structure A similar layout was adopted for Sir John Fastolf's castle at Caistor by Great Yarmouth in the 1430s. Caister Castle, built in brick, was laid out with three rectangular baileys, each of which was surrounded by a water-filled moat and fortified with open-back towers in the forward bailey.

The musicians involved share a common respect for improvised jamming mixed with years of playing and listening to all types of rock, psychedelic, Latin, jazz, blues, surf and punk music. The end result is an intense, cohesive wall of sound of heavy, dark, instrumental blues with psychedelic and surf overtones. The name \\"Ten East\\" comes from the highway which leads from the heart of Los Angeles towards the desert cities. The music is an expression of feelings that overcome oneself as they travel the two hours time down the length of highway, leaving behind the bustling metropolis and suburban sprawl in the wake of the mesa, mountains, and distant windmills. Their debut album, Extraterrestrial Highway was released in October 2006 on the record label Cobraside. The follow - up The Robot's Guide to Freedom was released in 2008, on the Lexicon Devil label. 2015- The new Ten East lineup featuring Gary Arce, Bill Stinson and Erik Harbers & Pieter Holkenborg from the band Automatic Sam, will be opening for Yawning Man and Fatso Jetson at the Deventer show (NL) at De Hip on February 13.

Jamie Gillis is considered to have started the gonzo pornography genre with his On the Prowl series of films. The name is a reference to gonzo journalism, in which the reporter is part of the event taking place. By comparison, gonzo pornography puts the camera right into the action, often with one or more of the participants filming and performing sexual acts, without the usual separation between camera and performers seen in conventional porn and cinema. Gonzo porn is influenced by amateur pornography, and it tends to use far fewer full-body/wide shots in favor of more close-ups (See: reality pornography). The loose and direct camera work often includes tight shots of the genitalia, unlike some traditional porn. Gonzo pornographic director Erik Everhard in 2005 Similarities to point-of- view (POV) pornography POV pornography; One of the actors (left) films the sexual act, which results in a point-of-view shot (background). Point of view pornography (POV) is adult entertainment filmed to look as if the watcher were experiencing the sex act themselves. In POV porn, the shooting style is generally similar to gonzo pornography, with the person receiving sexual gratification holding the camera themselves‚Äîaiming it down at the actor who is performing the sex act. This style of filming is in contrast to having a separate, third-person camera crew filming all the action. The effect is to give the viewer the sense that they are experiencing the sex acts that they are watching, as opposed to simply watching others as a voyeur. POV porn sometimes breaks the strict point-of-view convention. For instance, Amateur Allure has a trademark shot where the sexually performing cameraman circles a handycam around the sexually performing model's head. This yields a view that would not be obtainable directly through the eyes of a person while experiencing the sex act. There is, however, no third-party camera work involved. =POV pornography in Japan= In Japan, point of view pornography is referred to as . Hamedori is a genre of Japanese pornography in which a male adult video (AV) actor or director serves as the camera operator. Hamedori-type videos were produced from the beginnings of Japanese AV in the early 1980s. The term \\"hamedori\\" came into use about 1988‚Äì1989, but it was only a small niche area until it was popularized at V&R; Planning by director Company Matsuo. Matsuo started working in the genre in 1991, saying that this intimate technique was a natural way for him to shoot in order to show his feelings for the woman and to \\"get her to open up about herself, to show her true emotions\\". Matsuo used amateur actresses in his videos, and he usually traveled to their hometowns for the filming. He talked to them extensively on camera so that both he and the viewer can come to know them before any sex scenes. A large part of the popularity of these videos is seeing how regular and normal the women are in real life. As amateurs in a single segment of a multi-part video, the actresses are typically paid about 50,000 (around 500). Awards The X-Rated Critics Organization has had a \\"Best POV Release\\" award (2005‚Äì2009) and a \\"Best POV Series\\" (since 2010) in their annual XRCO awards. The AVN Awards have \\"Best POV Series\\", \\"Best POV Release\\" and \\"Best POV Sex Scene\\" awards.

Illinois, 278 U.S. 367 (1929), also referred to as the Chicago Sanitary District Case, is an opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the equitable power of the United States can be used to impose positive action on one state in a situation in which nonaction would result in damage to the interests of other states.. Pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution, the case was heard under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction because it involved a controversy between two states, Illinois and Wisconsin. Chief Justice William Howard Taft wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court. The case The city of Chicago increasingly was diverting Great Lakes waters to carry off sewage through a long- established drainage canal, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. Illinois claimed that these increasing amounts of diverted water were made necessary by Chicago's growth. Wisconsin, however, claimed that the diversion was lowering lake levels, thereby impairing its transportation facilities and abilities. After exhaustive hearings, a special master was assigned by the Supreme Court of the United States to consider the facts of the case fixed maximum diversion at a point below that necessary for continued utilization of the drainage canal system alone, thereby requiring the construction of sewage disposal works, but the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois procrastinated. The State of Illinois excepted to the special master's findings, and the Supreme Court heard the case en banc over two days in April 1928. Chief Justice Taft's opinion for the Court finally settled the question of the authority of the United States to intervene to enforce action by a state in such a situation. He wrote, \\"In deciding the controversy between States, the authority of the Court to enjoin the continued perpetration of the wrong inflicted on the complainants, necessarily embraces the authority to require measures to be taken to end the conditions, within the control of the defendant state, which may stand in the way of the execution of the decree.\\" This quote is not from the actual opinion of the case.

The released hyalin modifies the extracellular matrix of the fertilized egg to block other sperm from binding to the egg, and is known as the slow- block to polyspermy. All animals have this slow-block mechanism. Hyalin is a large, acidic protein which aids in embryonic development. The protein has strong adhesive properties which can help with cell differentiation and as a polyspermy prevention component. It forms the hyaline layer which covers the surface of the egg after insemination. Structure Its physical structure has a major and minor component. One is filamentous, having flexible molecules containing a globular domain head at the end. Its conformation is retained mainly by disulfide bonds, as virtually all cysteine amino acids are found in the disulfide form, but also hydrophobic forces and salt linkages stabilize the molecule. The filament length is about 75 nm long, and the head being club-shaped with a diameter of 12 nm. An isoform of the molecule exists, having a longer filament of 125 nm instead. Both forms of these filaments often fold on themselves, making the protein heterogeneous, resulting in poorly resolved stains on a gel. This makes the exact mass uncertain, as the protein is very difficult to purify. Estimates place the mass at about 350 kDa. About 2-3% of its mass is carbohydrates. Aggregates of hyalin also form by associating the heads of the protein, and hyalin remains accociated with a high, molecular weight core protein throughout purification. Hyalin mRNA is about 12kb in length. It encodes for approximately 25% acidic residues with only 3.5% basic residues. Within its sequence is a region containing tandem repeats of about 84 amino acids. This sequence is highly conserved between species, and is believed to be the adhesive substrate of hyalin. A recombinant part of this sequence was created and its adhesive properties were tested. It was found to be about as adhesive as native hyalin. Antibodies bound to the recombinant hyalin and blocked its adhesion similar to normal hyalin. The tandem repeat region was then found to be on the filamentous part of hyalin when the antibodies bound to it. As many as 21 of these long repeats can be present, accounting for 230 kDa of the total mass and two-thirds of the filamentous region. These repeats shows no resemblance to anything within the genbank, making hyalin a unique protein. Embryonic development =Location in cell= Hyalin is located in the cortical granules within an egg. Here, the protein is in a solated form. Cortical granules migrate to the inner plasma membrane where they remain inactive until the cell depolarizes. All protein at this point is of a maternal origin. Hyalin is confined within a subregion of the cortical granules, showing that and these vesicles hold enough hyalin to support the cell and form the hyalin layer until the gastrulation stage. Another source of hyalin is in the cytoplasm. This is also maternally derived. A hyalin layer which coats the embryo forms even after hyalin has been removed from the cortical granules, showing that this secondary reservoir exists. New hyalin is not expressed until after the gastrula has been formed. This is shown by the accumulation of hyalin mRNA. This mRNA is expressed around the blastopore at the endoderm-ectoderm boundary, which is rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum. New hyalin appeared on the apical surface of the ectoderm cells. It also had to be specifically trafficked as it did in the cortical granules. Hyalin does not penetrate into the endoderm. Some monoclonal antibodies were identified to carry molecules to the apical surface of ectodermal cells. Maternal hyalin persists throughout development and appears in the archenteron of the gastrula. Since the same genomic DNA gene encodes for both maternal and new hyalin, some alternative splicing must occur in order for the antibodies to carry the correct hyalin to the correct area. =Hyaline layer formation= Hyalin's structure is dependent upon calcium ions. It stabilizes against denaturation from the high concentrations of NaCl in seawater. Stabilization happens when concentrations are as low as 1mM. Calcium also causes hyalin to precipitate and form aggregates with itself and other proteins. Doing this would require higher concentrations of calcium. Another divalent ion, Mg2+, causes further precipitation of hyalin. When acting alone, magnesium cannot cause precipitation, but increases the effect of calcium precipitation. As stated before, the hyaline layer coats the external surface of an embryo. Once the egg is fertilized, then the cortical granules exocytose their contents into the extracellular matrix. When this happens, hyalin comes in contact with calcium ions and solubilizes. Binding with calcium also induces hyalin-protein interactions, creating aggregates of itself and other proteins. A gel like layer results, and the hyaline layer is formed around the egg. The hyaline layer grows to be about 2‚Äì3 mm thick within fifteen minutes after insemination. This layer forms in the extracellular matrix and functions as an adhesive substance for the blastomeres. =Function= The hyaline layer is responsible for the adhesion and proper orientation if the cells of an embryo. Throughout development, certain cells change their binding affinity towards hyalin. Hyalin helps cells differentiate into the animal and the vegetal halves during oogenesis by utilizing zinc and lithium ions. Zinc enhances the amount of hyalin precipitated, while lithium keeps the hyalin solubilized when around calcium. Zinc, then, causes an animalizing effect since the binding of the blastula cells would be stronger, while the weaker attachment of the cells would form the vegetal half. Cells can further differentiate if they gain an affinity towards other membranes. Invagination of the blastula occurs when the endoderm loses its affinity towards hyalin, while the ectoderm retains it. This leads to the keystone shape of the gastrula, with the different layers forming into separate biological systems. Hyalin has a secondary effect of aiding with polyspermy when in the hyaline layer. The fertilization envelope is the hardened mechanical barrier that blocks additional sperm from penetrating the cell. It is created by the products secreted by the cortical granules. Underneath the fertilization envelope is the hyaline layer, which covers up sperm receptors in the egg's plasma membrane. Should the fertilization envelope not form or dissociate, the hyaline layer alone blocks against polyspermy.

The agreement was signed by the country's four political parties after international mediators demanded their commitment to its ratification and implementation within a four-year period.  Provisions  The Ohrid Agreement created a framework for North Macedonia as a civic state. It established basic principles of the state such as cessation of hostilities, voluntary disarmament of ethnic Albanian armed groups, government devolution, and the reform of minority political and cultural rights. It ended the armed conflict between the National Liberation Army and the security forces of North Macedonia. The Agreement also included provisions for altering the official languages of the country, with any language spoken by more than 20% of the population becoming co-official with the Macedonian language at the municipal level. Only the Albanian language, with an approximate 25% of the population being speakers, currently qualifies as a co-official language under this criterion. The Agreement is an example of the adoption of consociationalism. According to the document, the English-language version is the only authentic version of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. The Government of North Macedonia had to adapt the Constitution of North Macedonia in order to provide the Albanian minority living in North Macedonia with fifteen basic rights. The lead negotiator on the behalf of the EU was Fran√ßois L√©otard, with James W. Pardew, who had been dispatched by Secretary of State Colin Powell, representing the United States.

Sometime Chairman of the Conservative Party, and of the British Anti-Slavery Society. Biography Glover was educated at Giggleswick School, where he was later a Governor, and where the \\"Sir Douglas Glover Memorial Lecture\\" is held periodically in his memory. On leaving school in 1925 he entered the family textile business, S.B. Glover & Co. Ltd., eventually becoming Managing Director. He also served for many years on the council of the Wholesale Textile Association of Great Britain. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he was a subaltern in the 7th Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, TA; in 1945 he was appointed to the command of the 2nd Battalion Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment in North- West Europe; and from 1947-50 he commanded the 9th Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, TA. For his services in the Netherlands he was made Knight Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

The book was an overnight success. When originally published in France, the books were credited to Serge and Anne Golon, Anne being the author and husband Serge having done much of the historical research. The two names were merged into Sergeanne Golon by the British publishers when the books were translated. The popularity of the books led to two films made in 1964 by Bernard Borderie. The actress Mich√®le Mercier played Angelique, and Robert Hossein played her husband, Joffrey de Peyrac. In 1972, Anne and Serge Golon went to Canada to continue their research. That year, as Anne wrote Ang√©lique and the Ghosts, Serge died. Anne carried on writing and brought up her four children at the same time. Between Serge's death and 1985, Anne wrote four more volumes, beginning with the second half of Ghosts (both portions published in French as a single volume, Angelique in Quebec) and proceeding through Ang√©lique's Victory. Anne Golon was reduced to a state close to poverty and filed a lawsuit against the French publisher Hachette for abuse of copyright and for her unpaid royalties.

The church is dedicated to St. Martin, and dates from about the 12th century. Holt Bridge, over the River Severn, was designed by Thomas Telford, and opened in 1830. History =Early history= Holt saw archaeological digs during the 1970s, in advance of gravel extraction. The oldest artefacts recovered were late Neolithic flints and pottery, possibly dating to about 2000 BC. Sherds of burial pottery from the Beaker period (c. 2000‚Äì1900 BC) were also found. The bulk of the archaeological evidence related to the early British Bronze Age (c. 1700‚Äì1450 BC) in the form of traces of low barrows and enclosures with associated cremations. No dwellings were identified. In 1844 a bronze axe was found during dredging operations in the River Severn below the site of Holt Lock. British Iron Age (1500 BC ‚Äì 40 AD) finds have been scarce, although crop marks indicated farming activity and a rectangular enclosure was partly uncovered. A few pottery sherds from that period have been recovered at other times, along with an iron pin also from the area of Holt Lock. There is some evidence of Roman occupation in neighbouring Little Witley, Shrawley and Grimley. =Saxon period= Worcestershire has one of the most complete and ancient collections of Anglo- Saxon charters that detail the grants of estates by the church and crown. Wick Episcopi was an area to the north-west of Worcester, roughly bounded by the rivers Severn and Teme and a line through Broadwas, Martley, Wichenford, Little Witley and Shrawley Brook, and thus included present-day Holt. The manors (later parishes) within Wick Episcopi where defined during that period. Beonot league (Bentley in today's Holt parish) was first recognised at that time. Other locations in Holt named in the Wick Episcopi grant of 775 include Heafuchrycg (Ockeridge), Doferic (Shrawley Brook), Saeferne (the Severn) and Baele Broc (Babbling Brook = Grimley Brook). Hallow, in 816, was one of the first single manors to be granted to a tenant lord by the Bishopric of Worcester. Prior to that it had been part of a larger estate, Worgorena league (the clearing of the people of Worcester), which also included Holt. The clearing concerned would have been in the southern portion of the still extensive but retreating Wyre Forest. One of Alfred the Great's client kings, Burgred, granted Alhun (or Alhwine), Bishop of Worcester various favours in return for two gold armlets weighing 45 'mancuses'. The grant, in 855, included exempting three 'manentes' in Beonetlege (Bentley in Holt) from pasturing rights by the king's swine in an area called Fern Pasture. In 962, with the consent of the king, Edgar, Bishop Oswald of Worcester let two 'mansae' at Beonetlaege (Bentley in Holt) to his thegn and minister Eadmaer. The grant described and defined the boundaries of the manors in terms of natural and man-made landscape features. Bentley's included references to Saeferne (the Severn), Baele (Babbling) Brook today known as Grimley Brook, Heafuc hrycge (Hawks Ridge/Ockeridge) and 'Dic in Doferic' (a boundary dike running to Shrawley Brook). Ball Mill on the Holt-Grimley parish boundary preserves a derivation of the name of Baele. Bentley manor became known as Holte (Holt) by the time of Domesday, the original name is preserved in the form of Bentley Farm. Holt(e) means a copse in an otherwise cleared area. Possibly when Bentley manor was granted in two parts the eastern portion was separately identified by the name Holte, which later came to represent the whole manor or parish. Eadmaer received a further grant in 969 when he took on an additional four 'mansi', or hides, at Witleah (Little Witley). The boundaries included all of Witley and the remaining portion of Bentley, probably in the area of Ockeridge Wood. This association of the two manors was repeated on subsequent grants. In 1017 Archbishop Wulfstan of Worcester granted the six hide Beonetleah (Bentley in Holt) with Witley manor to his brother, Aelfwige. =Norman period= St Martin's Church in 1879, by Henry Harris Lines The manor of Holt is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was held by Urse d'Abetot (c.1040-1108), first feudal baron of Salwarpe in Worcestershire, Sheriff of Worcestershire in about 1069. His estate there consisted of 5 hides (about 600 acres) with two ploughs (probably 8 oxen per team). There were 12 villagers and 24 smallholders with an additional 10 ploughs. A meadow and a woodland half a league square (c. 1440 acres) were also in the manor. A hedged enclosure was noted; this would have been for the capture of game such as deer and wild boar. A fishery (on the Severn presumably) was worth 5 shillings and a salt house in Droitwich 13 pence. The total value was ¬£6. After the Norman Conquest the new manorial lords quickly went about putting their physical mark on the landscape. This generally took the form of rebuilding the parish churches in the Norman architecture style. In Holt church the earliest architectural feature, an opening in the bell tower wall, was possibly constructed within ten years of the conquest. It bears Saxon characteristics and probably reflects the use of native stonemasons by the Norman lord. The nave was constructed about 1100 to 1110, and the chancel arch in 1120. The same mason appears to have carved the font and the arch. The rest of the structure of the building dates from periods in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as do some of the memorials and leaded windows. In 1113 Holt was still a chapelry of St Helen's in Worcester. A medieval deer park situated immediately to the south of Holt church may have pre-dated the Norman Conquest. =Medieval period= Holt Castle difference of the senior line of Beauchamp of Elmley, Earl of Warwick Holt manor passed to the Beauchamp family when Emeline d'Abetot, the daughter and eventual heiress of Urse, married Walter de Beauchamp of Elmley Castle, 12 miles south-east of Worcester. Holt was then held by successive Beauchamps, who in 1268 inherited the title Earl of Warwick with Warwick Castle, one of the most powerful earldoms in the country. Holt became the seat of John de Beauchamp (d.1297), a younger brother of the first Beauchamp Earl of Warwick. John's great-grandson was John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp (1319‚Äì1388) \\"of Kidderminster\\", seated at Holt Castle, who obtained a royal grant to hold a fair at 'Le Rode' in his manor of Holt, to be held annually on the Feast of St. Mary Magdalene (22 July). The 1st Baron was impeached by the Merciless Parliament on 12 March 1388 and was executed on Tower Hill, London, on 12 May the same year. At the time of his death he held manors, estates and properties throughout the Midland shires and beyond, but Holt remained his principal seat. It is thought he was the builder of Holt Castle. The only surviving original part of his building is the square tower which dominates the west (entrance) front, with fifteenth and sixteenth century additions behind. On the execution of the 1st Baron, Parliament expropriated all his lands and possessions and leased them out to various parties. Holt was obtained by his distant cousin Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick. In 1398 Parliament reversed its earlier decision and returned all his father's lands and title to Thomas's son John de Beauchamp (1378‚Äì1420), who died without male heir. At that time his estates included the manors of Holt and Hanley, near Tenbury, four more in Warwickshire, fish-weirs and fisheries in Ombersley and several properties in the city of Worcester. In the absence of a male heir the barony became extinct. His heir was Margaret de Beauchamp, his twenty year-old daughter, but the manor of Holt was split into three parts, each following a different female line of descent. Margaret de Beauchamp married firstly John Pauncefoot and secondly John Wyshaw, who in 1428 was holding the manor in her right. The deer park was enclosed following the death of the 1st Baron. Following the division of the manor of Holt in 1420, over 150 years passed before the manor was recombined following a series of complex transactions between Sir John Bourne, Anthony Bourne, Thomas Fortescue, John and Martin Crofts and Sir Thomas Bromley. =Early modern= Sir Thomas' eldest son, Sir Henry Bromley was born in Holt Castle. Sir Henry inherited all his father's lands except the family seat at Holt Castle, which was held by his widowed mother for her life. In February 1601 Sir Henry was implicated for his involvement with the Essex Rebellion, and his lands, including Holt Castle, were forfeited and he was briefly imprisoned. Upon the accession of James I in 1603 these lands were returned to him, and he proceeded to show King James his full loyalty. Nine years later Sir Henry reunited the final portion of Holt manor. As a magistrate Henry Bromley had rounded up the Jesuit priests Henry Garnet and Edward Oldcorne, the last wanted men in the Gunpowder Plot, at Hindlip on the outskirts of Worcester in 1606. Garnet and Oldcorne were held for a time in Holt Castle. =Modern= Sir Henry Bromley married four times, lastly to Anne Beswicke who erected a monument in the chancel of Holt Church to her husband who died 1615. In 1750 Sir Henry's descendants sold Holt manor to Thomas Foley, 2nd Baron Foley of Witley Court, Great Witley. In 1837 the Foleys sold off the Witley & Holt estates to realise capital which was needed to pay off heavy debts incurred by the 2nd Baron, a reckless gambler. The purchasers were the trustees of William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley (1817‚Äì1885). The estate was finally broken up in 1920 when the 2nd Earl moved on after his first wife's death.

Mehmet is portrayed as a charmer, rogue and a serial womaniser, and makes recurring appearances in EastEnders from 1985 to 1987, and then regularly until 1989. Storylines Mehmet is a Turkish Cypriot and the older brother of the original owner of the Bridge street caf√©, Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih). He is first seen in Albert Square in June 1985 when he takes part in one of Ali's regular late-night poker games. Like his brother, Mehmet is a serial gambler and whenever he gambles the stakes are often foolishly high. Unlike his brother, Mehmet doesn't live in Walford but Stoke Newington. In June 1986 Mehmet and Ali start a cab firm called 'OzCabs' from a corner table in Ali's Caf√©. Mehmet is married with three children, but monogamy is one sanctity of marriage that he is more than willing to overlook. Later that month punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) catches his eye, and so he bets his sceptical brother ¬£10 that he can get Mary to have sex with him. Mary is well aware that Mehmet's intentions are dishonourable and initially refuses to have sex with him, but Mehmet persists and she finally relents and spends the night with him. A triumphant Mehmet then collects his winnings and gloats to his brother in the caf√©. However, Mary overhears their entire conversation and she then sets about trying to get revenge on him by hoax calling his cab-firm and vandalising his car. Later in the year Mehmet acts as Pat Wicks's (Pam St. Clement) pimp, setting her up with clients on a regular basis and he even persuades Pat to convince Mary to go prostitute herself too. He also gets involved in Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) Knitting business, later conning her and disappearing with all her profits. After he gets into more trouble with his customers for overcharging on fares and then trying to seduce Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) ‚Äî the wife of his employee ‚Äî the residents of Albert Square decide to confront him. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) find him and give him a severe beating which involves having his arms pinned behind his back whilst taking a number of blows to the stomach. Mehmet proceeds to make things infinitely worse for himself soon after, when he stakes his house and business on a bet, loses and swiftly disappears leaving his wife, Guizin Osman (Ishia Bennison), to face up to the consequences. A then homeless Guzin arrives at Ali and his wife Sue's (Sandy Ratcliff) doorstep with the news that Mehmet had beaten her, and she isn't ever returning to him. Ali and Sue are forced to take Guizin and her three children, Murat, Rayif and Emine (Pelin Ahmet) into their one bedroom apartment. Mehmet returns to Walford in May 1987 and he manages to persuade his long suffering wife to give their marriage another chance. However, his promises to Guizin prove to be hollow as soon after he decides that the barmaid Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) is to be the next sexual conquest. Donna refuses his advances, but can't resist informing Guizin about his offer and Guizin and Donna nearly fight on New Year's Eve that year. Guizin and Mehmet's marriage is highly turbulent and they are always involved in intense arguments, mainly concerning money and gambling. In 1988 Mehmet and Guzin become partners in Ali's caf√© after Sue gives up working to look after her baby. Mehmet often clashes with his wife about the amount of time he takes off to gamble and the way the caf√© is run. Later in the year Mehmet and Ali run up huge gambling debts to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), manageress of Strokes wine bar, and who is also a member of the criminal underworld known as The Firm. Desperate for money the two turn to their caf√© employee, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), for a loan. He agrees, but charges his employers 10 percent interest and later, when they cannot meet the repayments, he demands a stake in the caf√©. The brothers refuse, but the debt eventually leads to Ali losing the caf√© to Ian the following year. Mehmet's marriage goes through some more trouble in 1989, when Ali's wife, Sue, discovers that her husband had been having sex with prostitute, Donna Ludlow. Sue is traumatised by this news and turns to Mehmet for comfort. Seeing her chance for revenge Sue makes a pass at Mehmet, purposefully kissing him in Ali's view. For once Mehmet is innocent, but Ali refuses to believe this and the brothers have a massive fight. Ali divulges Sue and Mehmet's fabricated affair to Guzin, who is unable to forgive her husband's latest infidelity with her sister-in-law. After viciously attacking Mehmet she leaves Walford to return to Northern Cyprus, taking their three children with her. After another huge argument with Sue, Mehmet decides to return to Northern Cyprus in order to win his wife back. His last appearance is in March 1989. Character creation and development =Background= Mehmet Osman was conceptualised by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mehmet, the brother of original character Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), was part of a well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had been at the forefront of the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their social contacts to relay information about their own origins and lifestyles, which they say allowed them to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically. =Casting= Actor Haluk Bilginer was one of only three London-based, Turkish-speaking actors available at the time of casting in 1984. He was originally put forward for the role of Ali Osman along with another actor, Nejdet Salih. Bilginer was Turkish, and Holland and Smith have commented that he \\"was almost type-casting for the 'peacock' they were looking for', right down to the Bandito moustache and hairy chest!\\" However, Salih was actually Turkish-Cypriot and had a background \\"surprisingly similar\\" to Ali's. Holland and Smith disagreed about which actor should have the part of Ali; Holland preferred Bilginer, while Smith preferred Salih. Holland believed Bilginer possessed the right \\"look\\" and that Salih was not tall or tough-looking enough, \\"he didn't have the sort of physical presence that put you on your guard.\\" He also believed that Sandy Ratcliff, the actress playing Ali's wife Sue, would have \\"made mincemeat of [Salih]\\". Additionally, Holland visioned Ali with a moustache, and unlike Bilginer, Salih was unable to grow one. Conversely, Smith felt that Salih was \\"the genuine article. Not Turkish, but Turkish-Cypriot. He would have so much actual knowledge to bring to the character [...] He wouldn't have to act the part, he was the part.\\" Both actors were given a script reading with the actress who would play Ali's wife, Sandy Ratcliff, who arrived for the reading 45 minutes late. Bilginer read with Ratcliff first, and Holland and Smith have commented that he \\"had obviously thought about the part [...] because there was much more physical power in his performance. At one stage Julia and Tony were worried that he might even hit Sandy!\\" Salih read next, and after being introduced to Ratcliff who apologised for her tardiness, to which Salih replied \\"Not to worry. Typical bloody woman!\\" His quip impressed Holland and Smith; they have since commented that Salih almost got the part on the strength of that line alone, as the felt it typified the character perfectly. Salih was eventually given the part of Ali, but as there were only two suitable Turkish speaking actors available, and as Ali would need a brother, Bilginer was given the part of Mehmet Osman. =Development= Mehmet Osman makes his first appearance on- screen in June 1985, four months after the show originally aired. His arrival coincides with a cot death storyline of Sue and Ali's baby, Hassan. Mehmet appears as a recurring character from 1985‚Äì1987, setting up a cab firm named Ozcabs from inside Ali's caf√©; however, he becomes a regular in 1988, when both he and his wife Guizin (Ishia Bennison) are made partners in Ali's caf√©, which is renamed Caf√© Osman. Mehmet is portrayed as a charmer, a rogue and a womaniser. Author of The EastEnders Handbook, Hilary Kingsley, has said of him, \\"he tries it on with every woman he meets and sometimes succeeds through a combination of good looks and sheer audacity.\\" A serial gambler, Mehmet was shown to steer Ali into various money-losing ploys, and had a combustible marriage to Guizin, who put up with his philandering, as in the Turkish community, that's \\"what a wife was expected to do\\". Described as \\"the Terrible Turk\\", Haluk Bilginer was one of the more popular male cast members on EastEnders during the 1980s, and he reportedly received sackfuls of fan mail, \\"despite playing a villain and a womanising snake\\". Hilary Kingsley has said that what made the character so popular was Bilginer's Omar Sharif-style good looks and charm. Following the departure of Holland and Smith, Mehmet was eventually written out of the serial in May 1989, in a storyline that signified the disbandment of the Osman family. On-screen, Mehmet returns to his native Cyprus after a fight with Guizin regarding her suspicions about Mehmet's fabricated affair with Sue. The Osman family were among many characters to leave the serial that year. Writer Colin Brake has commented, \\"the pace of comings and going was fast and furious during 1989, as the programme tried to find a new direction.\\" Bilginer went into musical theatre after leaving EastEnders.

Originally, the term was not related to lolicon (attraction to young or prepubescent girls), but instead to agalmatophilia (attraction to statues, dolls, mannequins, etc.), since the figurines were not alive. Japanese journalist Akihiro ≈åtani coined the term, claiming that this group was composed of potential criminals. Summary In Japan, the term \\"figure\\" can refer to dolls and other collectible figurines. Figures based on anime, manga and bish≈çjo game characters are often sold as dolls in Japan. Collecting them is a popular hobby amongst Otakus. The term moe is otaku slang for the love of characters in video games, anime, or manga, whereas zoku is a post-World War II term for tribe, clan or family. Japanese journalist Akihiro ≈åtani coined the term \\"figure moe zoku\\", and, although he said, \\"I don't intend to blame Otaku\\", he claimed that \\"Otakus who collect figurines\\" were potential criminals and that one of them had killed a 7-year-old girl in November 2004. According to his theory, the killer murdered the victim soon after the kidnapping, because the killer was not interested in her living body, but in her corpse. The lifeless body could then be described as a figurine. Akihiro ≈åtani used the term in conjunction with Kaoru Kobayashi, who did not, in fact, own any figurines. However, during an ANN special broadcast on the morning that Kobayashi was arrested, ≈åtani commented that Kobayashi was a \\"Figure Otaku\\", insisting that \\"Figure Otaku\\" was synonymous with \\"lolicon\\". As ≈åtani's idea of the \\"figure moe zoku\\" seemed illogical at best, fans of the anime genre began using it ironically and humorously. The term was awarded the Okada Toshio Award at the Japanese Otaku Awards' 2004. Other usage Although Kobayashi was not an otaku, as of January 2005, Japanese local governments continued targeting otakus, expecting similar cases from them. Therefore, the term became regarded as an extreme case of irresponsible statements of mass media, though the background of media circus was apparently Tsutomu Miyazaki.

Founding The old building of the National Theatre in 1901‚Äì1904 It was founded as the Teatrul cel Mare din Bucure≈üti (\\"Grand Theatre of Bucharest\\") in 1852, its first director being Costache Caragiale. It became a national institution in 1864 by a decree of Prime Minister Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, and was officially named as the National Theatre in 1875; it is now administered by the Romanian Ministry of Culture. In April 1836, the Societatea Filarmonica ‚Äî a cultural society founded by Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu and Ion C√¢mpineanu ‚Äî bought the C√¢mpinencii Inn to build a National Theatre on the site, and began to collect money and materials for this purpose. In 1840, Ob≈üteasca Adunare (the legislative branch established under the terms of the Imperial Russian-approved Organic Statute) proposed to Alexandru II Ghica, the Prince of Wallachia, a project to build a National Theatre with state support. The request was approved on June 4, 1840. Prince Gheorghe Bibescu adopted the idea of founding the theatre and chose a new location, on the spot of the former Filaret Inn. There were several reasons to favor this locations: it was centrally located, right in the middle of Podul Mogo≈üoaiei (today's Calea Victoriei); the earthquake of 1838 had damaged the inn beyond repair, and it needed to be torn down. Old building The August 13, 1843, report of the commission charged with building the theatre determined that construction would cost 20,300 Austrian guilder (standard gold coin) of which only 13,000 gold coins were available. In 1846, a new commission engaged the Vienese architect A. Hefft, who came up with an acceptable plan. Construction got under way in 1848, only to be interrupted in June by the Wallachian revolution. In August 1849, after Prince Barbu Dimitrie ≈ûtirbei took power, he ordered that construction be completed. The front of the Bucharest Novotel, on Calea Victoriei in 2010, replicates the exterior of the old Romanian National Theatre approximately in its original location The theatre was inaugurated on December 31, 1852, with the play Zoe sau Amantul √Æmprumutat, described in the newspapers of the time as a \\"vaudeville with songs\\". The building was built in the baroque style, with 338 stalls on the main floor, three levels of loges, a luxurious foyer with staircases of Carrara marble and a large gallery in which students could attend free of charge. For its first two years, the theatre was lit with tallow lamps, but from 1854 it used rape oil lamps; still later this was replaced by gaslights and eventually electric lights. In 1875, at the time its name was changed to Teatrul Na≈£ional, its director was the writer Alexandru Odobescu. The historic theatre building on Calea Victoriei ‚Äî now featured on the 100-leu banknote ‚Äî was destroyed during the Luftwaffe bombardment of Bucharest on August 24, 1944 (see Bombing of Bucharest in World War II). \\"CumpƒÉna √Æntre nazism »ôi comunism\\", Evenimentul Zilei, August 22, 2004; accessed June 16, 2013 Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"Cioburi din istoria Teatrului Na≈£ional\\", Rom√¢nia literarƒÉ, nr.11/2007; accessed June 16, 2013 The modern theatre National Theater Bucharest, in its form from 1983-2012 The current National Theatre is located about half a kilometre away from the old site, just south of the Hotel Intercontinental at Pia≈£a UniversitƒÉ≈£ii (University Square), and has been in use since 1973.

A bottom- feeder, it feeds on microcrustaceans, aquatic insects, detritus, and algae. The black redhorse spawns in the spring. This species has been identified as Threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). It is currently being considered for listing under the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). Description The black redhorse is a species of the sucker family, Catostomidae. It is laterally compressed and has a shallow body shape with little arching to the back. Nearly half of the head is a long, rounded snout. The mouth is on the underside of the snout and has a thick lower lip. The body is silvery-blue with a gray or brownish dorsal surface and silver or white belly. Some of the scales have dark edges. During the breeding season males have dark stripes and orange or pink coloration along the flanks, and develop nuptial tubercles on the tail fins.COSEWIC Assessment and Status Report on the Black Redhorse Moxostoma duquesnei in Canada - 2015. The black redhorse can be distinguished from similar species by the lack of red on the tail and the lack of grooving on the lips. Distribution The black redhorse has a wide, but disjunct, distribution in eastern North America. It is found from Alabama and Mississippi in the south to Ontario and Michigan in the north, and from New York in the east to Oklahoma and Minnesota in the west. In Canada, it is limited to southwestern Ontario where it occurs in only six watersheds. In the Lake Huron drainage, it is found in the Bayfield River, Maitland River and Ausable River watersheds. In the Lake Erie drainage, it is known from the Catfish Creek (extirpated) and Grand River watersheds. It is also present in the Thames River watershed in the Lake St. Clair drainage. Habitat and life history The black redhorse usually lives in moderately sized rivers and streams, 25 to 130 m wide, up to 1.8 m in depth, and with generally moderate to fast currents. It is rarely found associated with aquatic vegetation. Substrates include rubble, gravel, sand, boulders and silt. In summer, they generally prefer pools and overwinter in deeper pools. In the spring, black redhorse migrate to spawning habitats. Spring spawning has been observed in riffle habitats at water temperatures between 15 ¬∞C and 21 ¬∞C, and over a variety of substrates from fine gravel to large cobble. Eggs are nonadhesive and range in size from 2.6 to 2.9 mm. The age at maturity is between two and six years. Lifespan increases with latitude and some individuals reach 16 years of age. Diet Adult black redhorse are bottom feeders and eat crustaceans and insects. The younger fish (less than 65 mm) are thought to prefer plankton. Relationship with humans Habitat may be altered or impaired through urbanization and agricultural activities that increase siltation, turbidity, and change flow regimes. The availability of suitable habitat limits the distribution of the black redhorse in Canada, rendering its distribution highly fragmented. Its restricted spawning habitat preferences make recruitment vulnerable to changes in flow regime. Dams and impoundment of riverine habitats also restrict movements of fish. Incidental catches of black redhorse by sport fishers have been reported and may impact populations. The IGFA world record for the species stands at 2lb 4oz caught from Franklin Creek in Franklin, Pennsylvania in 1998. References External links NatureServe. 2018. Moxostoma duquesnei.

It flows entirely within the Baƒçka region, and during its 129 km long course, on a section of only 15 km, it crosses the Hungarian-Serbian border eight times (92 km in Hungary, 37 km in Serbia). Hungary The K√≠gy√≥s (Hungarian: snake) originates in Hungary from two streams. One stream, the Bokodi-K√≠gy√≥s- csatorna, itself originates from two smaller streams west of the city of Baja. One stream springs out at the village of R√©m, other one at Borota. The streams meet at Fels≈ëszentiv√°n and continue to the south, next to the villages of B√°csbokod and B√°csbors√≥d. Another stream, the M√°t√©telkei-K√≠gy√≥s-csatorna originates north of the village of Tatah√°za, and it flows to the south next to the village of M√°t√©telke. The river comes close to the Serbian border but turns west, flowing next to the village of Katym√°r. East of Katym√°r, right before it crosses the Serbian border, two rivers join and from that point the river is generally known as the Plazoviƒá. Serbia In Serbia, the river turns west, flowing only within the area of Sombor municipality of the province of Vojvodina. Passes next to the village of Riƒëica and spills over into a series of bogs (Seke≈°, Trska, ≈†upljina) between the villages of B√°csszentgy√∂rgy (in Hungary) and Rastina (in Serbia). East of Bezdan, the river turns south before it empties into the Great Baƒçka Canal, near the village of Baƒçki Mono≈°tor. Between the villages of Baƒçki Breg and Kolut, the Plazoviƒá flows next to the Baƒçki Breg fishpond. Characteristics The Plazoviƒá belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin. The river is known to cause floods, especially in 1970 and 2004, but in the past it was also known for drying out completely, like in 1952. High water level is helped by the very abundant vegetation in the river's bed, which also makes the water look dark brown. During cold winters, the river freezes.

It forms part of the sole remaining section of the railway which once served a 46-mile network across the island. Access The B23 road between Douglas and the village provides vehicular access to the station and passes through a tunnel underneath the line after which the station driveway is directly to the left of the road. Locale To the eastern end of the station the railway passes over the main road by means of a large stone bridge; at the southerly end the line passes into Crogga Woods from where can be seen the large house and miniature railway. Development The station was originally provided with a basic wooden building but by 1898 it had become clear that the popularity of the nearby resort demanded a more substantial building; to this end, the current grandiose station was erected and included station masters' residence, refreshment rooms and booking facilities; the latter has been retained as part of the private house but only as a feature and the station is no longer manned. Origins The station was built primarily to serve the popular coastal resort which is a short walk from the station via one of the Manx National Glens. Although largely derelict today, this resort was once a hugely popular destination for tourists Electric Tramway The resort was also once served by the Douglas Head Marine Drive and Electric Tramway which took a spectacular coastal route from Douglas Head to a point above the beach; this tramway was established in 1896 and closed in 1939 upon the outbreak of war. A landslide on part of the route saw that it never opened again although the route was modified and operated by omnibuses for a number of years. Other Transport Owing to the popularity of the venue it was also served by ferry boats, charabancs and of course the railway. So popular was the place that the station boasts the only full-height platform at an intermediate station on the south line other than Port St. Mary which, at one time, was intended as the southern terminus. Improvements In 2002 all stations received platforms, and the little used passing loop at this station received another (seldom used) full-height platform on the \\"down\\" side, together with waiting shelter, indicative of the management policy to provide passenger facilities at each station, seemingly regardless of how well patronised the stations were. Crogga Valley Railway To the south of the station is a 7¬º inch gauge miniature railway which is visible from the land side of passing trains. The railway, that runs around the grounds of the house of the same name, is not open to the public. Manx Nameboards For the start of the 2008 season the station was adorned with new bi-lingual station nameboards; differing from all other stations on the line insofar as one side (the \\"up\\" platform) has the name in English, and the other (the \\"down\\" platform, which is rarely used) is in Manx, stating \\"Purt\\" as opposed to \\"Port\\"; the nameboards feature a yellowy-cream lettering with black shadowing on a maroon coloured back board, the now-standard livery of station nameboards on the line. Residents The station building is still extant but in private ownership, having been converted from a derelict state in the 1980s. Previous owners included Alex Lloyd (racing driver). It is an imposing large structure, more latterly replaced by two wooden shelters on each platform. The \\"down\\" platform was added in 2002 when much of the railway was re-laid as part of the IRIS scheme. Today The station remains open but unmanned; there are two wooden shelters on the platforms. A further small hut stood at the easterly end of the station to provide accommodation for station staff at the rare times when the station is used for passing of trains until it was destroyed in a storm in 2012. Incident On 19 May 2008 there was an incident at the station involving a van and oncoming train which resulted in a collision of the two. The matter was widely reported in the media but as the train was travelling no faster than 5 miles per hour no injuries were sustained. There was however much damage to the Vauxhall van and remedial damage to the wooden buffer beam of the 1874-built locomotive which was involved. Local emergency services attended but train operations were continued later in the same day; a health and safety report has since been commissioned into the incident. Route References * James I.C.

The halt sometimes plays host to Santa's Grotto each December as part of the railway's Santa Trains service although between 2010 and 2013 it was not utilised for this purpose. The railway station is situated off the A5 Port Erin to Douglas road, between the railway stations of Ballasalla and Port Soderick. Naming When the land was surveyed in 1872 for the formation of the railway it was originally intended to call the railway station here (or hereabouts) Ballavale; although the name persisted in many items of paperwork and on plans the railway station has always been known as Santon despite being some distance from the \\"Newtown\\" area which is today considered to be the village area. Crossings To the north of the railway station the line passes over a road bridge and travels along an embankment; immediately after leaving the railway station environs the line passes under the main Douglas to Ballasalla road and thereafter onto another much larger embankment across the Santon Burn to the occupational crossings of Ballalona and Ballastrang farms. The latter is the sole remaining manned level crossing and retains its manually operated gates. Building The railway station is the last on the line to still boast its original 1874 building; however, similar structures were in place at Port St Mary, replaced 1898; Ballasalla, replaced in 1985 and Colby demolished in 1980. The building is of simple style, being of timber construction with corrugated iron roofing, painted in an cream and red style unchanged since the late 1960s. It includes the station master's accommodation and porters' rooms as well as a passenger waiting shelter recessed from the running lines. In 1985 the railway station building was cosmetically restored at the expense of the now-defunct Isle of Man Railway Society and attention was given to the wooden slatting that form its exterior walls; a better form of wooden window shutters were also added at this time, the previous incarnations having been somewhat crude affairs. Upon completion of the project a large sign board denoting the improvements was erected over the porters' room window, but this was later removed when the group became defunct. In the intervening years no further remedial work was carried out and the condition of the building deteriorated considerably until it received further attention in 2002 as part of the redevelopment of the railway station when the entire infrastructure of the railway was overhauled. It has had a recent repaint in 2014. Hanging baskets and flowers added plus a bench on platform opposite the railway station building. The railway station is occasionally used for crossing trains during special events as 'Rush Hour' and the annual Santa Trains each December. Santa's Halt No. 4 Loch (1874) at the railway station during Santa Special services in December 2012. The railway station has played host to Father Christmas and his enchanted grotto for several years from 1986 when the railway's popular Santa Trains terminated here, the railway station being renamed as Santa's Halt annually for this purpose. In more recent years this practice was discontinued and a much shorter run was introduced with Father Christmas passing among the passengers to distribute presents and trains only travelling as far as various points on the first section of the line prior to Port Soderick railway station. Happily, in 2008 the full run to Santon was reinstated, and a further two years of these services were provided. The grotto was constructed each December by panelling in the recessed passenger waiting shelter in the railway station building. The railway's three coach Bar Set of saloon coaches were placed in the siding at the railway station for provision of mulled wine, mince pies, tea, coffee and other refreshments and the area suitably decorated; the railway station renamed for the occasion which used to take place in the first two weekends of December. However, in 2010 a considerable revamp of the railway's established seasonal services saw the terminus moved from here to Castletown railway station which was renamed Tinseltown for the occasion, this continued annually until 2013 but the 2014 festive services once again used Santon railway station. Parcels & livestock Train entering, the main road bridge in the distance. For many years the railway station played unofficial host to the railway's lost property; legend has it that once uncollected parcels and such were not claimed after a certain period from any other railway station on the network, they were dispatched here for storage, theoretically awaiting collection; such was the regularity of this occurrence that by the time of its closure in 1958 (it became an unmanned halt after this time) the covered storage areas were packed full with passengers' unclaimed belongings from floor to ceiling. Situated as it is, in a largely rural area, the siding here was once extremely active with cattle traffic and despite its tranquil location the railway station was busy with farm traffic; such was demand that it remained a manned railway station until relatively late in the railway's history; the development of suitable road vehicles to transport livestock eventually saw to the demise of this. The cattle dock remains in situ today, used as a ballast storage area, the associated pen having been removed in poor condition in 1975. The area also served as a manure dump from outlying farms and deposits were moved island-wide by rail from here. Such was the unsavoury nature of this undertaking that a large advertisement hoarding was erected the length of the siding to shield passing passengers from the sight. Terminus No. 12 Hutchinson (1908) enters the railway station when it was the temporary terminus. The railway station had not been manned regularly for a great many years (1958 being the last recorded regular staffing) and until a major relay of the entire railway in 2001 it had basically been untouched for well over a century. In connection with these major works, for the duration of the 2002 summer season the railway station acted as the railway's terminus while major tracklaying was in progress and at this time the railway station facilities were improved considerably, with each of the two rooms of the original building being renovated to provide accommodation for railway station staff to the left, and passengers to the right. A drinks vending machine was installed at this time, and it was said that it was the most activity that the sleepy railway station had even seen in its entire 130+ year existence. When the track renewal programme was completed it was revered to being a quiet rural halt, though the improved facilities were to remain beneficial for the annual Santa Trains which terminated here until 2009. The revised timings for the festive services saw the railway station once again used as the temporary terminus in December 2014 when the Santa Specials returned to use the railway station building as the grotto. In more recent times the railway station has also been used as the terminus for various photographic charter specials (the railway station is a popular backdrop for photographs) as well as extra non-passenger trains that operate during the annual Rush Hour event and the Manx Heritage Transport Festival which has taken place each July/August since introduction in 2009. The 2014 event marked 140 years of the Douglas-Port Erin line and saw a special service hauled by diesel electric locomotive No. 21 call at Santon railway station with a train carrying a selection of Peel P.50 motorcars. Environs A northbound train crosses the Santon Burn to the immediate southwest of the railway station. The railway station can be found by taking a left turn immediately after having passed over the bridge under which the railway travels. The turning is demarcated by a white wall with the railway station's name carved into a stone set into the wall. There is a further driveway entrance on the northern approach which is accessed via a small road to the railway station's northeasterly side. The station's sheltered location boasts some magnificent palm trees. What now forms a flower bed on the railway station platform was once the foundation for wooden store, constructed from the bodywork of an old brake van; it was common to find new uses for vehicles in this way. There was also a manure siding protected from the running line by a series of hoardings; the goods siding and its respective platform remain extant although relaid in recent years. The siding for many years was home to an array of expired stock such as the final surviving wagon M.70 and the railway's breakdown crane. In connection with the railway station's temporary role as the line's terminus in 2002 a water tank on metal legs was installed and this remains extant although largely unused. A park bench is located on the \\"up\\" platform with a brass plaque duly dedicated. Immediately to the south of the railway station the line passes underneath the main Douglas to Port Erin road by means of a bridge and after passing through a short cutting passes over the Santon Burn atop a man-made embankment. Entry to the railway station from the north side is over another high bridge. Within walking distance of the railway station is the Mann Cat Sanctuary and Murray's Motorcycle Museum both of which open at key dates in the summer months. The railway station is also a popular drop off for the walk to nearby Port Grenaugh and the famous Fairy Bridge. Friends Of... Since the summer of 2013 there has been a small community group tending for the railway station in the summer months; in addition to colourful floral displays on the site the group have also provided some period platform furniture and hope to expand their activities in the future with the addition of period signage and other historical enhancements. The group work in conjunction with similar Friends of... groups that exist elsewhere along the line, notably the Friends Of Castletown Station and a group at Port Erin.

Early years Hawkins was born on April 18, 1914 in Fort Scott, Kansas. When he was a baby, he suffered an accident which scarred him for life. A neighbor accidentally spilled a can of scalding hot water over him and it was a year before his mother was able to cure the muscular damage by massage and he could walk again. When he was five, the family moved to El Paso, Texas; when he was eight, his father died and his mother had to seek outside employment. She was employed as the secretary to a high school principal and, later, as a teacher in the El Paso Technical Institute. An excellent student, he skipped fifth grade at LaMar and Alta Vista Schools and graduated from El Paso High School when he was 16. He won a scholarship to the Texas College of Mines, where he studied engineering. During summer vacations, he delivered magazines and sold newspapers, and worked as a bellhop, ranch hand, and railroad laborer. When he was 21, he went to Tacoma, Washington, to work. At 23, he was an engineer for a Los Angeles title-insurance company. Marine Corps service After Pearl Harbor was attacked, he enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve on January 5, 1942, and was assigned to the 7th Recruit Battalion, Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego. He had tried unsuccessfully to enter both the Army and the Navy Air Corps, but his scars prevented his being accepted. Now, as a Marine, he joined the 2nd Marines, 2nd Marine Division, completed Scout Snipers' School at Camp Elliott, San Diego, and on July 1, 1942 embarked aboard the for the Pacific area. A private first class when he went overseas, he was quickly promoted to corporal and then sergeant. On November 17, 1942, he was commissioned a second lieutenant while taking part in the Guadalcanal campaign in the battle for the Solomons. On June 1, 1943, he was promoted to first lieutenant. Less than six months later, he was killed in action leading a scout-sniper platoon in the attack on Betio Island during the assault on Tarawa. During the two-day assault, 1stLt Hawkins led attacks on pill boxes and installations, personally initiated an assault on a hostile position fortified by five enemy machine guns, refused to withdraw after being seriously wounded and destroyed three more pill boxes before he was mortally wounded on November 21, 1943. For his actions above and beyond the call of duty, 1st Lt Hawkins posthumously received the Medal of Honor. In September 1944, the Medal of Honor was presented to Hawkins' mother by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a White House ceremony. Grave stone of William Deane Hawkins in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (Punchbowl), Honolulu, Hawaii 1stLt Hawkins' remains were eventually interred in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. Remembrances and honors Robert Sherrod, then Editor of The Saturday Evening Post, wrote the following about the Marine platoon leader: > Hawkins had told me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up > against any company of soldiers on earth and guarantee to win. He was > slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but the > furthest thing from his mind was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into > the forest of coconut palms. During a day and a half he personally cleaned > out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and > firing point blank at four or five men who fired back at him from behind > blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still > refused to retire. To say that his conduct was worthy of the highest > traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is > moderately high. In recognition of his leadership and daring action against enemy positions, the air strip on Betio Island was named Hawkins Field in honor of the Marine hero. With his unit 1st Lt Hawkins also shared in the two Presidential Unit Citations awarded the 1st Marine Division (Reinforced) for heroic action during the Guadalcanal and Tarawa campaigns. The bar at The Basic School, is called The Hawkins Room, after 1st Lt. Deane Hawkins. The Basic School is a six-month basic officer course for newly commissioned 2nd Lts and Warrant Officers. Because 1st Lt. Hawkins received a battlefield commission, he never attended The Basic School. Camp LeJeune in North Carolina had a winter camp named after Lt. Hawkins. Camp HM Smith in Honolulu, Hawaii has a small area of land identified as Camp Hawkins, named after 1st Lt. Deane Hawkins. The site is located at the extreme NE portion of Camp Smith and now sits within a secured perimeter fence line. Originally used in the later part of the Second World War as an R&R; location, the site contains a small stone cabin and overlooks the southern coast of Oahu, from Diamond Head to Barber's Point. Cornerstones on either side of the cabin's doorway, identified the area \\"Shangri La\\" as it was dubbed by the construction engineers and the cabin itself is identified as ‚ÄòCamp McMullan‚Äô. Camp Hawkins was used as a training area for Marines, a recreation area (with the addition of playground equipment in the 1970s) and a camp ground for military personnel and their families. Today, it is used almost exclusively as a camp site for local Boy Scout organizations. In El Paso, Texas, Hawkins Road and Hawkins Elementary are both named after Deane Hawkins. Hawkins' archives were kept by his mother, Mrs. C. Jane Hawkins, and are in the possession of the El Paso County Historical Society. Medal of Honor citation The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to FIRST LIEUTENANT WILLIAM D. HAWKINS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE for service as set forth in the following CITATION: > For valorous and gallant conduct above and beyond the call of duty as > Commanding Officer of a Scout Sniper Platoon attached to the Second Marines, > Second Marine Division, in action against Japanese-held Tarawa in the > Gilbert Islands, November 20 and 21, 1943.

It forms part of the sole remaining section of the once extensive network that operated across the island. Ballasalla was the usual crossing point for trains, making it popular with photographers, until the introduction of the 2015 timetable which saw all trains passing at Castletown and the effective closure of Ballasalla as a manned station, save for special events. Buildings The New 1986 Station The original wooden railway station was built in 1874 (to the same design as that still extant at Santon, the next halt eastwards on the line). Being a market village the railway station soon acquired cattle docks and goods platforms. The original building was demolished in 1985 and replaced by a brick building housing a small ticket office and waiting area, which was built in 1985 and was opened in 1986 by Jack Nivison, the former President of the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man and MHK for Middle. Before this, the railway station, like several intermediate stopping places on the line, did not provide passenger platforms. The new building, however, was built at platform height, and the platform was long enough for a five-coach train, later increased to seven. The railway station also has a stone-built water tower and crossing-keeper's hut; the latter was extensively modified to house the now-defunct mechanical railway station gates. A crossing-keeper's house on the other side of the road is now a private dwelling. In 2002 the opposite side of the line also received a full-length platform, which also serves the goods siding, and a modern bus shelter was also installed; the platform edging used had previously been employed for the former South Line departure roads at Douglas railway station and was retained for future use when lifted in 1979. There was also a goods shed on the site ‚Äî a reused wooden building originally from the prisoner of war camp at Knockaloe near Peel, which was also served by the railway during the First World War. Although now extensively modernised and not really recognisable as the railway station that existed until 1985, it remains one of the most picturesque settings on the line and was popular with photographers who had the opportunity to take images of two trains at once. From 2001 to 2012 this railway station was the only crossing place in regular use on the line, as after timetable changes in 2001 there were no crossing trains at Castletown railway station. However, with the introduction of a more intensive high season timetable in 2012, with six trains each way instead of the usual four, some trains have once again been crossing at Castletown, and all trains from 2015. Terminus No. 10 G.H. Wood crossing Nol. 12 Hutchinson at the railway station in 1998 Prior to the nationalisation of the railway in 1978, the railway company tried some experiments to reduce expenditure to keep the railway alive. Ballasalla railway station was (for one season only) the terminus of the line: a short run between here and Port Erin was the only service in 1976. The previous year the line was shorter still, only offering travel between Port Erin and Castletown, and it was largely due to campaigning by locals that services extended this far. The Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association led a campaign to have the line fully reinstated. In 1977 the entire line opened once more, and has remained open ever since on a seasonal basis. Before 1977, many goods trains also terminated here, with the nearby local weekly mart being a busy local event. With the village being surrounded by farms, the mart provided a vital source of income for the railway and the facilities that featured here were a testament to its once bustling location. In 2010 the railway's inaugural Teddy Bears' Picnic special trains were also based here, although train services operated through to Port Erin as normal rather than dedicated trains terminating here. With its run round facilities and water tower, the railway station is occasionally used for special hire services that connect with the local hostelry. Everyday service trains however do not terminate here, but all halt. Crossings The automated main road crossing in 2003; the cottages to the right were occupied by railway porters When the railway arrived here the road was little more than a pack-horse road; at its intersection with the railway, traditional level crossing gates were installed. A gatekeeper's house and small lodge were also built; these both still stand: the former is now a private house, whilst the latter remains extant though out of use. It was not until the 1960s that the wooden manually operated gates were replaced with far larger mechanical gates, and the small gate lodge modified to accommodate the \\"wheelhouse\\", a small signal box-type structure in a position above the road to increase visibility for the person operating the gates. A series of inter-connected rods beneath the road protected by large metal plates were also extant, but when the whole crossing was relaid in 2000 these were removed and a standard concrete crossing installed. These gates were opened and closed by a large ship's wheel structure which remains in situ. These distinctive gates were a feature of the line and survived until 2001 when, in line with a health and safety ruling, they were removed and replaced with automatic barriers which are now operated by the railway station staff from the platform for departing trains and by treadle activated by trains approaching from a southerly direction. The barriers now in operation tower above the site when in the \\"off\\" position; they are long enough to block both carriageways when in use. The crossing is also protected by colour lights to warn motorists of approaching trains, and a set of repeater lights on the exit to Silverburn Way further alert motorists approaching from the south. Silverdale Silverdale Boating Lake This railway station serves the local attraction of Silverdale Glen, a small pleasure park with its own boating pool and water-powered merry-go-round with refreshment rooms. This is a 15-minute walk from the railway station and was once very popular, making the railway station busy. The attraction is open throughout the year and is a popular destination for model boat enthusiasts who use the shallow boating lake out of season. In season there are both rowing boats and hand-operated pedal boats, popular for many years. In the past there was also a large indoor model railway layout here, with coin- operated trains. There was also a grotto-type walk-through feature with illuminated gnomes in a forest environment. Today the cafe and restaurant are a popular stopping off point. The tree-lined glen that joins the village and the pleasure park has a wishing well and leads directly to the other nearby attraction, part of the Story of Mann located at Rushen Abbey. Some paths in this area form part of the Millennium Way, a long public right of way created in 1979 to celebrate 1000 years of the island's parliament. It climbs beyond this point towards the centre of the island. Rushen Abbey Rushen Abbey Ruin Site, Manx National Heritage The national heritage site at Rushen Abbey is also a short walk from the railway station; once a popular venue for dancing and famed for its cream teas, it later became the Academy nightclub and fell into disrepair before being developed as a major historical attraction. The earliest origins of the site can be dated to the 10th century when Savignac monks from Furness Abbey established a site here, later falling to Cistercian rule when the two orders merged. The nearby abbey church is dedicated to St. Mary but is approximately one hundred years younger than the abbey proper. Dissolved by the 16th century, by the early 19th century the ruins were marketed as a tourist destination served by the railway and famous for the strawberries and cream before the Second World War. After several years in different guises it was bought by Manx National Heritage in 1998 and excavated over the following years. It is now a heritage site and one that is popular with rail travellers when open (between April and October). A small visitors interpretation centre leads to the abbey gardens where there are interactive displays as well as audio and video material. An area designated for children is also available, where you can build a monks' arch among other activities. The popularity of this attraction is such that signs on the platform alert passengers that it is the correct railway station to alight to visit it. A further large sign in the car park gives details of the directions to the site. Environs Ballahick Automated Crossing Above the railway station to the west are the crossings serving Ballahick and Ballawoods farms; these were until 2001 manned by seasonal gatekeepers but the installation of automatic barriers saw this practice discontinued. The office development that adjoins the station was once the extensive goods yard. This was sold off to create developments in 1985, when the original station building dating from 1874 was demolished. A row of local authority housing appears to the south- west of the railway station next to the level crossing keeper's hut; beyond this is the Silverburn Estate, a housing development dating from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Beyond this are the village pub (the Whitestone), a few shops, post office, primary school and a nursing home. In the village are the offices of the local authority, Malew Parish Commissioners. An industrial estate on the site of the nearby Balthane Farm is home to a number of local businesses and also provides access to the runways and a footpath to the beach. The name of the village is from the Manx language Balley Sallagh, \\"Place of Willow\\", and there are many willow trees in the surrounding area. Friends Of... In early 2019 a volunteer group was established in conjunction with the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association and the local authority Malew Parish Commissioners with a view to adopting the station, tending to the floral displays in the summer months and otherwise enhancing the site. The intention is to follow the precedent set by the Friends Of Castletown Station with working parties on site regularly as a community scheme similar to those provided elsewhere along the line, it being commented that the general upkeep of the station had deteriorated since it became an unmanned site.

It opened in 1945 as the Civic Playhouse and was run by the Corporation of Cheltenham; it was taken over by volunteers in 1958 who continue to run the operation as a registered charity. It is housed in the former Montpellier Baths and the building dates back to 1806/7, making it one of the two oldest surviving spa buildings in the town. History In 1944, the Corporation of Cheltenham (now the borough council) realised the town‚Äôs lack of theatrical facilities and, spearheaded by town clerk Frank Littlewood, decided to open a Civic Playhouse to act as a home for local amateur companies. They decided to convert the swimming pool part of the Montpellier Baths complex and, despite war time restrictions on material and manpower, it opened on 9 April 1945, making it, as far as is known, the only new theatre to commence operating during World War II. Good will messages and telegrams came from George Bernard Shaw and Ralph Richardson (who had been born in the town). The Corporation funded the services of the front of house staff, the cashier and box office facilities and all the publicity. A consultant producer and resident stage manager were also provided at the council's expense to assist the amateur groups, although the production requirements and expenses remained the responsibility of the societies. The first play performed was Arms and the Man by George Bernard Shaw. On 5 April 1950, the theatre suffered a major setback when the auditorium was severely damaged by fire. The repair work was evidently undertaken with speed and the theatre was only closed for five months. However, the fire destroyed part of one of the theatre‚Äôs balconies (which were formerly viewing balconies for the swimming pool) and this was not restored until 2007. When the Corporation decided it no longer wished to fund the theatre, volunteers formed the Theatre & Arts Club in 1956 and they officially took over the running of the venue in 1958 and over time acquired more part of the building which, at that time, were still being used as baths or for medical treatments. In 2007, the theatre was flooded twice within the space of five weeks, along with many other parts of the UK. Only two performances had to be cancelled. In 2008, the auditorium and green room underwent a ¬£340,000 refurbishment, half the funding of which came from Cheltenham Borough Council, together with additional donations from the Summerfield Charitable Trust, Trefoil Trust, a generous bequest from a founder member, several of the resident non-professional companies and the charities own fundraising efforts. Over recent years, the venue has expanded from being solely a venue for local amateurs to receiving small-scale professional theatre productions plus live music, cinema, comedy and dance. A professional Christmas production has been presented since 2010 and in 2019 this was financed by the theatre itself for the first time and future in-house professional productions are planned. In 2019, planning permission was obtained for a major redevelopment of much of the complex (excluding the auditorium). Funding will be sought in the region of ¬£3.5 million to achieve the charity's ambition to become a fully-staffed professional arts centre while still remaining home to local performers. Montpellier Baths In 1716, the first Mineral springs were discovered in Cheltenham, transforming it into a spa. 1806/7 saw the opening of a small complex built by Henry Thompson that encompassed a handful of baths, a sudatory (steam room) and a self- administering enema machine. Around this time he also built Hygeia House to make use of three wells on its site for the taking of the waters but within a few years he turned this into his private house and in 1809 opened the Montpellier Spa for this purpose (which is now The Ivy restaurant). Water was pumped from around Thompson's land to the complex on this site so that in addition to the baths he could open a salts laboratory for the manufacturing of the Real Cheltenham Salts that could be added to water for bathing. The complex was enlarged circa 1818 when it boasted 14 warm baths, fitted with marble and Dutch tile, one large cold bath plus smaller ones and a boiler capable of heating up to 190¬∞F.\\"The Playhouse Cheltenham - A Brief History \\" Further enlargements followed in the 1830s and in the 1840s a large swimming pool was established; this was refurbished by the Corporation of Cheltenham when they bought the complex in 1899. The current auditorium is built over this pool and is used as a furniture store; it is shown each September as part of Heritage Open Days. In the Edwardian times in addition to slipper baths upstairs, the ground floor was used as a medicinal spa for a variety of treatments including a radio active mud bath.

Foundering of the Eliza of New York, off Takaboku island (Nagasaki Meisho Zue). In 1797 he was commissioned by the Dutch from Batavia to take the ship Eliza of New York to Nagasaki, Japan, with a cargo of Dutch trade goods. The ship however reportedly sunk just a few hours after leaving Dejima, off the Takaboku islands. After being floated and repaired, it sailed again to Batavia, but was never heard of again. On July 16, 1800 Stewart returned to Nagasaki, Japan on board a ship named The Emperor of Japan. It was discovered that his ship was in fact the Eliza of New York, which he had apparently stolen and renamed. He tried in vain to trade through the Dutch enclave of Dejima. The director of the Dutch enclave, Willem Wardenaar, instead sold the cargo as contraband, and used the profit to repay the original repairing and re-floating of the ship. Stewart was imprisoned and sent to Batavia, but he apparently managed to escape. He sailed again to Japan in 1803, but again did not manage to sell his cargo. Stewart's actions were mentioned extensively by Hendrik Doeff, the then Dutch commissioner in Dejima, in his book \\"Recollections of Japan\\". He died in New Orleans of yellow fever in 1818.

The station is the busiest of the railway's intermediate stations, being the closest to a number of local visitor attractions. In peak season service trains often pass here, making the station one of the railway's more active stopping places. The station occupies a site within walking distance of the main town and is in close proximity to the local playing fields. Origins left This is an original station on the Isle of Man Railway situated on the north-eastern edge of the town of Castletown. When the railway was first constructed the town had until ten years previously been the island's capital and therefore a substantial station was provided. Although the most extensive intermediate stopping place on the line, it remains some distance from the town itself, being a brisk ten-minute walk to the centre of the town. One of the railway's considerations was originally to terminate at this station, but plans were made to extend the line so that the terminus would be on the quayside. These never came to fruition and the site of today's station is the original one. The size of the station site and associated buildings can be attributed to the town's importance as the capital of the island and seat of parliament until 1869 when Douglas was made the capital. In the intervening time there has been much development of residential areas so that today the station is considered to be in the town itself. In more recent times the town's close proximity to the island's only airport has ensured that it remains a busy residential and commercial area, being the nearest built-up area to the runways. Until 1967 the station was the closest to the airport, but the establishment of Ronaldsway Halt in that year effectively gave a more convenient place to alight for potential commuters. Location Castletown Square with the Smelt Memorial at its centre; this is approximately 10 minutes' walk from the station Despite the town's importance (it served as the island's capital until 1869, just five years before the railway's arrival) the railway station is some distance from the centre of the town, at the north-easterly side. The railway company considered many various alternative sites for the station before settling upon the location; a cursory view of a map of the line reveals that between the preceding station (Ballasalla) and the following one (Ballabeg) the line deviates considerably from its course. Despite this, the station has always been one of the most active on the line, providing a source of much freight and goods traffic over the years. Since the station was established the town has spread considerably to the extent that today is surrounded along one side by both residential and industrial premises, including a petrol station and car sales establishment. The main attractions of the town are a short walk from the station, an approximate five-minute walk from the station along the bank of the Silverburn River leading to the heart of the town which surrounds the inner harbour. The town itself was considered to be second only to Douglas in importance to the island; with its bustling harbour and active agricultural scene, the station's importance remained until the final days of operation with livestock being transported from the station's cattle dock (the remains of which are still visible today) until the final year the railway operated its full network in 1965, although the line did reopen to passengers only later. Close to the station are the local primary school at Victoria Road, the medical centre in the Sandfield Complex, the local Morton Hall, and Qualtrough's Timber Yard, all in walking distance. Structures Detail of the building with period milk churn and blackboards The former goods shed is used during Rush Hour No. 4 Loch (1874) taking water using the new tower The restored waiting room with period detail and coal fire =Station Building= When the line opened in 1874 this station was furnished with a stone structure built in the distinctive grey limestone found at nearby Scarlett Pointon, (the original station at Port Erin was of identical design but construction was of local slate). The floor plan was an enlarged version of the wooden buildings used elsewhere on the Port Erin Line at Santon, Ballasalla and Colby; by the turn of the century it became apparent that this was insufficient for the requirements of this busy town and the station building was enlarged in 1903 to its present design. Facilities were improved considerably and the structure housed a station master's office, toilets and general and ladies waiting rooms. This was followed by the addition of a canopy and veranda (the latter lost in 1956) to the station building in 1910 to provide additional passenger shelter. =Goods Shed= The station was provided with a timber second class goods shed upon the opening in 1874, believed to be similar in construction to those elsewhere on the system; by the turn of the twentieth century it became apparent that the town was an important location for import of goods so, in 1902 a new stone-built structure with red brick quoins and detailing was constructed, identical to that provided at Port St. Mary. This featured rail access at both ends as well as doors at both rail and platform level and an exterior loading bank at the northern end. Until 1994 the rear siding at the station also extended far beyond its current limit, also serving the current car park and rear platform- height doors, this was removed in order to create additional car parking. This saw much use until the decline of the 1960s and later saw use as a camping hostel before returning to railway use in 2008 by which time a permanent way team were based there. Today the structure is used only for storage and is occasionally open to the public as part of railway events annually, when it is used to store goods stock and road vehicles. It became a listed structure in 2008. =Water Tower= Established in the earliest years of the railway, the original water tower at the station was constructed of local limestone, again quarried from nearby Scarlett Point and was fed from a well beneath it by means of a hand pump in the tank house beneath the tank itself. This was demolished in 1978 and owing to the depth of the well the majority of stonework was emptied into the hole as rubble, while some was retained to provide edging for new lawns and flower beds. It was not replaced until 1999 when the station served as a temporary terminus during short line workings. The new tank is of metal framed construction and is served by mains water; this facility is still used in conjunction with charter services, notably when No. 8 Fenella is used, having smaller side tanks which require replenishing more frequently, or when Ultimate Driving Experience trains call at the station. The current tank is sited to the south-west of the original. =Restoration Work= The station was extensively renovated in the winter of 1993/1994. A new peaked roof was constructed over the gentlemen's toilets, and the old wooden canopy removed and window apertures converted into archways. At this time the station master's office was halved in size to create a booking hall and a new internal ticket hatch installed, the original being blocked off the waiting room was also reopened, having been closed for over 30 years. The overhauled station was reopened with suitable ceremony later that year by local politician Phil Kermode who at the time was the minister with responsibility for the railway. During the winter of 2012 the partition in the booking hall was removed, recreating the full sized office, and the fireplace reinstated; the original ticket hatch was also brought back into use. In the summer months the station building is adorned with flower baskets and period features such as milk churns (a nod to the station's former importance for handling goods and freight traffic), reproduction notice boards and enamelled signage reinstated on the exterior walls based upon period photographs. This work was carried out by the Friends Of... group. Displays Tynwald on display; these are now off-island The station's distinctive triskelion during restoration The breakdown crane, formerly on display at the station, now at Union Mills =Locomotive Frames= The former goods shed exterior loading platform became the home in 1985 to the remaining component frames of the railway company's 1880 locomotive No. 7 Tynwald for display purposes, although many major components were by that time scrapped; the display consisted of the main frames, cylinders, coal bunker, with a set of carriage wheels substituting for the pony truck. The locomotive had not been used in traffic since 1947 and was purchased by the group in 1978 following the nationalisation of the railway, to save it from scrap. The frames were initially stored at Ballasalla Station, later being removed to Santon Station before being relocated here. They were owned by the now-defunct Isle Of Man Railways & Tramways Preservation Society, and for a period they were moved to off-site storage before being returned to the goods platform in the autumn of 2009 only to depart again in 2012 due to issues with railway's management and the owners. They now reside on the Southwold Railway in Suffolk and await restoration. There is currently nothing displayed on the platform although the Friends Of... group have future plans. =Triskelion= Also at the station, to the side of the goods shed in a gravelled raised section of the lawn is a large cast concrete Triskelion or Legs Of Mann at platform level, painted in a yellow and red colour scheme. It is believed that this piece was relocated from the long-closed stopping place at Peel Road on the Ramsey Line, and was relocated at some point prior to the closure of these other lines in 1968, and prior to 1975 when the Peel Road site was cleared. This feature originally had a gravel surround which was later replaced with grass. In 2012 the Friends Of... group restored the item, repainting it to a golden colour scheme with red gravelled surround to mimic the colourings on the national flag though it returned to its more familiar red, yellow and black setting in the spring of 2016. Originally the feature also had a large circular surround although this was beyond repair to be removed from the original site. =Other Items= On the rear goods siding, one of the railway's three breakdown cranes was stored for a number of years, being removed in 1991 and subsequently restored and placed on display at Union Mills on the site of the former railway station. This crane was constructed in 1893 by the Birmingham-based firm Richard C. Gibbins. Inside the station's waiting room are several framed displays charting various historical aspects of the railway featuring old photographs, framed tickets, maps and other historical documentation relating to the earliest days of the railway. A headboard commemorating the centenary of the adjacent Poulsom Park in 1996 is also mounted on the wall above the fireplace, several other pieces of ephemera are available to view at the station. For many years, there also featured large advertisement hoardings lining the down platform but these were removed in 1974 having become unsafe. The Friends Of... group have plans to reinstate the hoarding in 2015 and have secured funding from Culture Vannin to proceed with the project subject to planning approval. An original signal windlass constructed by the Birmingham company A.J. Linley & Co., was also displayed on the up platform for many years, a similar version is extant and used to operate the unique slotted post semaphore signal which protects the station's southerly side. Poulsom Park Poulsom Park, the station lies above this play area, secreted by the large trees to the rear right of this view. To the northeasterly side of the station lies this park, provided and funded by a generous benefactor to the town and being established at around the same time as the railway and it is from this benefactor that the park takes its name; it consists of a large grassed area and is surrounded by perimeter railings within which are contained playground equipment for children and two football/rugby pitches which form the home grounds and changing rooms for the local clubs. The play equipment has been greatly improved in recent times, the standard slide and swings being replaced by a pirate ship-themed set of equipment. The park is accessed either from a wide path that passes underneath the railway at the south-western end, or via a set of steps accessed from the station platform. More recently the area has become home to a skateboard park which is viewable from the passing trains; this facility is popular with local children who use the facilities for both skate boarding and stunt bike racing. Such is the popularity of the park with travellers that it can be accessed directly from the line's northbound platform; the area is a popular site for campers in the summer months as well as being home to the local football and rugby teams who regularly play matches there. The brick-built changing rooms and club house facilities for the rugby team are located at the northern end of the park, close the skatepark. A macadam pathway around the perimeter of the play park, and sporting fields is a popular with walkers and a regular Walk & Talk event takes place here. In more recent times the park has been plagued by vandalism which has resulted in the installation of closed circuit television cameras to monitor and apprehend culprits. Filming =The Ginger Tree= As part of a major adaptation of the Oswald Wynd novel in 1988 the station was used to film exterior scenes, together with several other locations on the line, which doubled for Russia during the revolution. The recessed canopy was dressed with luggage and artificial snow for numerous linking scenes, and locomotive No. 11 Maitland was memorably repainted into a matt black colour scheme as part of the filming, a scheme it retained for the remainder of that season. Much of the location work was filmed during the hours of darkness and the scenes shot at the station do not feature a train although one was present. At the present time the series has not been repeated nor is it available in any home media format. The production was made by the BBC. =Thomas & The Magic Railroad= The live-action film version of Thomas The Tank Engine was partially filmed at the station, forming the basis of Shining Time Station (itself a variation of the series screened in the U.S.) in the story and the building and its environs were considerably disguised for this purpose, with a temporary canopy being built in the place where the original had once stood; whilst being a temporary structure this canopy looked remarkably similar to the original which had been demolished some seven years previously. The distinctive limestone station building was completely encased in wooden cladding and finished in a brown and cream colour scheme for the duration. Between the filming the production company provided their own style station nameboards which were erected between shots for the convenience of passengers, the railway remaining operational throughout the period of filming. The goods shed was disguised as the local Cooperative Store and period cars and set dressings were featured in the station. Some of the scenes shot featuring Alec Baldwin (the 1st station master), Michael E. Rodgers (the 2nd station master) and Peter Fonda (the grandfather) were shot at this location. The railway was used extensively during filming, with Port St. Mary goods shed being transformed into a workshop for the purpose and other island locations were also used including the Tynwald Hill Inn at St. John's. The locomotives and carriages were however not featured in the finished motion picture. =Five Children & It= The station was again used for filming in 2005 when a live-action version of the Edith Nesbit story was filmed on the island, particularly in and around the town. For this, a temporary canopy was reinstated along the frontage of the station in a similar position to the original, and this remained in place through the majority of the peak season. the canopy was fitted with replica decorate fascia boards to match in with the extant versions. The film starred local resident Sir Norman Wisdom and the creature was voiced by Eddie Izzard. Scenes at the station retained the name of Castletown which are clearly discernable in the finished film. Upon completion of filming a number of smaller period props were retained at the station. =James May's Toy Stories= During June 2014 an episode of this series was filmed on the island as part of the T.T. races when a motorcycle constructed entirely of Meccano was driver around the famous mountain circuit. As part of the filming Oz Clarke took a footplate ride on locomotive No. 10 G.H. Wood alighting at the station where linking footage of the train and its crew was filmed. Events =Island At War= During the annual Island At War event the station is dressed with a period feel Beginning in 2010 the station has taken part in an annual event, usually held on the third weekend of August, as part of a wartime recreation weekend staged by the railway. The station building and goods shed are dressed with period posters and memorabilia, with all traces of modern signage and additions being removed or concealed for the duration of the event. Anti-shatter tape is applied to the windows and historical recreation groups attend the site adding to the period atmosphere; themed music is played on the station's public address system and various music groups also attend throughout the weekend entertaining around the station site. At previous events there have also been stagings of un-exploded bombs, sandbag bunkers, field hospitals and other period dioramas. This weekend is one of the busiest of each season and attracts both locals and visitors. Local groups of scouts also attend the site, camping on the concourse and providing period foodstuffs such as rabbit stew to passengers. Similar events are staged of several other stations along the line during this event, notably at either termini at Douglas and Port Erin . In recent times similar themed events have also taken place at Cregneash Folk Museum operated by Manx National Heritage for which a shuttle bus service has been operated from Port St. Mary. =As Tinseltown= The station was renamed as Tinseltown for festive services between 2010 and 2013 In December 2010 the station was renamed for the first time as Tinseltown; this was carried out when it was used as the terminus for the railway's popular annual Santa Trains for the first time; these seasonal services had previously been terminated at Santon Station for many years. As part of a new initiative operated by Manx National Heritage, the local authority Castletown Commissioners and the railway the revamped services saw trains bring passengers to the station on an hourly basis for a short shuttle bus ride to Castle Rushen where Santa's Grotto was located in addition to traditional market stalls, fairground rides, an enchanted forest walk and snow machine. For these services the station was decorated with festive lights and music played, and adding to the festive feel of the station several of the services took place following an unusually heavy snowfall that blanketed the island in December 2010. As part of the experience the unusual step of allowing buses into the relatively small station car park was permitted and the Tinseltown Shuttle departed at regular intervals, echoing the latter years of Railway Company operation when Road Services buses called at the station at regular intervals when the rail-based services were restricted during the winter months. This theme and use of the station as a terminus was repeated in 2011 and 2012; in 2013 the grotto was based in the station's office; the decision was taken to revert festive services to Santon Station in 2014. =2011 Commonwealth Youth Games= On Monday, 12 September 2011, the station played host to the official parties connected with the 2011 Commonwealth Youth Games with the \\"culture day\\" prior to the closing ceremony of the event taking place in the town; to accommodate the vast numbers travelling on this occasion passenger services on the railway were suspended for the day whilst the competitors and officials were transported by rail to the station. The event has been a fixture of the sporting calendar taking place every four years since the inaugural event which took place in Edinburgh in the year 2000 and the 2011 event was the first time that the island has hosted the event. The event is designed as a small-scale version of the Commonwealth Games aimed at children and young people; past hosts have included Bendigo in Australia and Pune in India. The event saw the railway coping with its largest crowd on a single day for what may possibly be the first time since the annual influx of passengers on Tynwald Day ceased to be a major part in the railway's calendar after the Peel Line closed in 1968 when the railway stopped serving the village of St. John's where the outdoor ceremony is still held on 5 July each year. For the 2011 event, every serviceable steam locomotive on the railway was used (No. 4 Loch, No. 10 G.H. Wood, No. 12 Hutchinson and No. 13 Kissack all seeing service) together with all available coaches, which totalled 18 bogie carriages - the first time this number of coaches had been available since 1974 - including three newly refurbished coaches all of which are over one hundred years old. Once competitors arrived at the station they were transferred to the town square by four Wright Eclipse Gemini buses provided by the island's nationalised Bus Vannin arm of the transport division. All competitors attended specially prepared events at Castle Rushen before returning to the capital by rail. = For Southern 100 Ceremony = With ongoing regeneration works in the town's historic market square at the time of the event, the organisers of the Southern 100 motorcycle races held the closing ceremony and prize presentation for the 2015 outside the station; the road was cordoned off from Victoria Road to the station forecourt and a temporary dais installed on the approach lawn to the station to allow the event to take place. Several hundred people attended the event, which may become an annual sight at the station, and the Friends Of group provided refreshments. As part of the 2015 event the races marked their diamond jubilee resulting in record crowds attending the ceremony, at which Guy Martin was hailed as the overall winner, being a long- time supporter of the event, which is known widely as the \\"friendly races\\". =As Ballavolley Halt= During the 2015 Manx Heritage Transport Festival some of the stations along the route of the extant Port Erin Line were renamed as former stations of the Manx Northern Railway with Castletown being designated as Wild Life Park on 1 August 2015 only. The station's running in boards were covered with plastic signs denoting this, with selected other useful signage for passengers being removed for the duration of the event. One locomotive, No. 10 G.H. Wood was also temporarily renamed to appear as No. 5 Mona during the day, with other stations taking on dual roles, Port Erin becoming Ramsey and Douglas becoming St. John's; the request stops at both The Level and Ronaldsway Halt were not renamed, with bin liners covering the running in boards at these sites. The original halt at Ballavolley opened during the summer of 1965 upon the establishment of the Wild Life Park, consisting of a simple running in board and ground level grassed platform. It was again used during the brief reopening of the Ramsey Line 1967, taking its name from the nearby level crossing (the gatehouse of which remains extant today), being named \\"Ballavolley Halt - For Wild Life Park\\" rather than the \\"Wildlife Park\\" title used during the reenactment. School Hill Station The temporary signage on the platform in house style Opened during strike action taken by employees of Bus Vannin during 2012, this temporary station was located approximately three-quarters of a mile to the south-west of the station and was used only by local school children attending Castle Rushen High School; it consisted of temporary scaffolding platform with a capacity for five carriages, and operated only when the buses were on strike, at which times special trains replaced the bus service. It was located close to the start-finish line of the Southern 100 circuit and was removed after a considerable time out of use in April 2014. This was the first \\"new\\" station on the line since the halt serving Lough Ned Country Park (between Douglas and Port Soderick) was established in 1979; this however was closed in 1986 upon the demise of the park. School Hill was fitted with a vinyl banner as a station running-in board in the current house style, featuring bilingual titling¬∞. When in operation the halt was manned by a station attendant and control of it was via internal radio communication with the station. It was also used during two of the railway's Rush Hour events when a recreation Manx Northern Railway train consisting of the locomotive Caledonia and the Foxdale Coach briefly stopped there for photographic opportunities. Today there is no trace of the temporary on the site. Environs A train on Pumphouse Curve to the southwest of the station To the immediate north of the station is a stone- built footbridge which provide pedestrian access from the adjacent Poulsom Park to the privately owned King William's College; the railway passes underneath this structure. The southerly extent of the station sees the line pass over the Silverburn River by means of stone overbridge also constructed from local limestone; an occupational crossing titled Mill Road is beyond, being controlled by the station by automatic barriers. Until 2001 this was a manned crossing and the gatekeepers' hut remains extant although disused. From this point the railway runs parallel to the by-pass road next to the route of the Southern 100 motorcycle racing circuit. In the station forecourt there are two public houses, namely The Viking to the left and The Sidings (free house) to the right. The latter was formerly known for many years as the Duck's Nest but the name was changed in 1996 gaining the name which acknowledges its close proximity to the railway station. A petrol station is located beyond these, and a car dealership whilst across the main road a sheltered housing complex is evident; the town itself, and the famous Castle Rushen, are a short walk from the station along the banks of the Silverburn River which runs through the town to the harbour. Friend Of... This group was formed in late 2010 by a group of local residents and the resident station master with a view to enhancing the station; small groups of volunteers occasionally meet at the station to carry out these improvements which to date have included the erection of a station flagpole (a traditional sight on many Isle of Man Railway station platforms) some painting of the station including the platform benches, provision of traditional blackboard signage to the station, and most significantly, the reinstatement of the coal fire in the waiting room for the first time in many years. The group continue to have an input to the upkeep of the station and will be donating concrete cast planters in the future for addition to the station's platforms. The group have, to date, spent many hours attending to the small details around the station, that which would not ordinarily fall under the jurisdiction of the railway's full-time staff. In 2012 the station won the commercial category of Castletown in Bloom, an annual competition, and took place in the Hidden Gardens event. The seasonal station master co-ordinates all activities and he can be contacted at the office whenever trains are in operation or by telephoning the station directly. The group always welcome new members and suggestions for further enhancement of the area; a number of photographic material and ephemera relating to the station have been donated since the group's formation and these can be found on display in the waiting room which is open whenever trains are running. In 2014 the group held its first Summer Fayre on the site, raising funds for various projects including the proposed reinstatement of the station's advertisement hoarding and a replica cattle dock. This was followed by an Easter Fayre in 2015 to tie in with the railway's annual Rush Hour event with a further summer event taking place in August. Since this time the summer fayre has taken place annually towards the end of August. Model Railway (2014) 'N' Gauge Railway Layout In the spring of 2014 an \\"N\\" gauge model railway layout was installed in the bay window of the stationmaster's office facing out onto the station's platform area, as an additional attraction to the site. The diminutive layout was based around the Great Western Railway and usually operated only in season when trains were calling at the station and at peak times. It was installed by the seasonal stationmaster as a project of the \\"Friends of...\\" group to complement the historical displays around the site and consisted of two independently operating loops with a variety of sidings, including a locomotive shed and yard, and goods yard with coaling area and was constructed to fit the small bay window of the stationmasters' office, viewable from outside by members of the public. The layout featured one station with island platforms and footbridge, a fire station complete with pumps and tower, a large spired church with graveyard, detailed allotments, a piggery, and a windmill which dominated the small area. The layout operated model locomotives of the Castle Class, Pendennis Castle and Drywyllin Castle which operated regularly, the similar Hall Class Albert Hall and Kinlet Hall, and a prototype Flying Banana railcar, as well as a number of early Pannier Tank engines, a Prairie Class, and an autocoach with 14XX tank engine all in Great Western livery. In addition a large range of bogie passenger stock operated and a rake of diminutive four-wheelers, all carrying the traditional chocolate and cream colour scheme of the pre-war Great Western Railway by and large. Private operator wagons and vans also featured on the layout, which had an integral goods yard. The layout was removed from the station in February 2016. Model Railway (2020) It was announced by the \\"Friends Of..\\" group in February 2020 that a new model railway exhibition was to be created by the volunteers using the former store room at the station and work began on establishing this upon easement of Covid-19 restrictions; the new layout is OO gauge and features three concentric loops, again being themed on the Great Western Railway and featuring a variety of locomotives and rolling stock; work remains ongoing on completing the layout and it was open for public view when trains are operating during the shortened 2020 railway season. Souvenir Shop In the early part of 2016 the former station masters' office and parcels office was converted to become a souvenir shop; this entailed removal of some historical features from the Friends Of... collection; the shop is expected to be open in time for the Rush Hour event taking place in its traditional slot over the Easter Weekend. In addition to the usual array of gifts it is expected that the shop will stock the two models produces by Oxford Diecast, one of which is of locomotive No. 12 Hutchinson. The shop is also expected to stock a range of postcards, fridge magnets, posters, railwayana, clothing and publications and will effectively replace the more modest sales items previously sold on the site by the Friends Of... group until the close of the 2015 season. This will be the first time that a dedicated retail outlet has been established at any of the railway's intermediate stations, although there have previously been similar ventures at Douglas Station (until 1999) and the large shop at the entrance to the Isle of Man Railway Museum at Port Erin remains the main souvenir shop for the railway.

Early life and education Jean McGarry was born in Providence, Rhode Island, was educated at Regis and Radcliffe Colleges, the University of California-Irvine and Johns Hopkins University, where she received an M.A. in The Writing Seminars in 1983. Career McGarry has worked as a newspaper reporter and translator, but mostly has taught writing, first at the University of Missouri-Columbia, then at George Washington University, before coming to Hopkins to join The Writing Seminars faculty in 1987. She chaired the department for eight years and is presently co-chair. Her first book, Airs of Providence, was a collection of stories, interwoven with the chapters of a novella. Published in 1985, it won the Southern Review prize for short fiction. The Very Rich Hours, which came out two years later, was another such blend: a novella about life at Harvard in the early 1970s, arranged around a set of prose poems. By the third book, The Courage of Girls, a novel set in New York, all such experimentation had (at least temporarily) ceased. In 1994, Home at Last, a collection of stories, was published in 1994 and reverted to scenes from the streets of Providence, ranging in time from 1938 to the then present. Three years later, another novel, Gallagher‚Äôs Travels, was published: this book tells the story of an ambitious reporter on the make in the world of daily newspapers. A chapter from Airs of Providence was excerpted in Cabbage and Bones, an anthology of Irish American Women‚Äôs Fiction, 1997. Dream Date, 2001, marked the point at which experimentation reappeared. This book was followed by Ocean State, another collection of stories. In the works, Spin Cycle, a novel, Blue Boy, a novella, and Tinytown, a story collection. Individual stories have been published in The Yale Review, Little Star, Boulevard, Southern Review, The Southwest Review, North American Review, Chicago Review, The New Yorker, Antioch Review, Stand, Sulfur and other journals.

More recent productions include V for Vendetta, Captain America: Civil War, √Üon Flux, The Bourne Ultimatum, Valkyrie, Inglourious Basterds, Cloud Atlas, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Hunger Games, and Isle of Dogs. Today, Studio Babelsberg remains operational mainly for feature film productions. Furthermore, it acts as co-producer on international high budget productions.  History  Movie set Berlin at Filmpark Babelsberg, adjacent to the studios Babelsberg Studios in 1952. In 1911, the film production company Deutsche Bioscope built its first glasshouse film studio (early studios designed to take advantage of natural light) in Neubabelsberg. The company had been originally formed by Jules Greenbaum in 1899 and incorporated in 1902. As his business increased, Greenbaum made a deal with the chemist Carl Moritz Schleussner of the photochemicals firm Schleussner AG in Frankfurt/Main. Carl Schleussner had been involved since 1896 in producing negative film stock for R√∂ntgen photography soon after its discovery.Eisenbach, Ulrich, (2007).Schleussner in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 23, pp. 68-69 [Online edition (in German). In February 1908 Carl Schleussner bought a majority share in Deutsche Bioscop as a film manufacturing, duplicating and sales operation, for a 2/3 share of 140,000 marks, with 1/3 provided by Jules Greenbaum & his brother Max. Ownership of Deutsche Bioscop was transferred to Schleussner AG and registered on 27 February 1908: Schleussner bought out the Greenbaums' remaining share of Deutsche Bioscop in 1909. The first filming in Babelsberg began as early as February 1912 for The Dance of Death by Danish director Urban Gad. In 1920 the Deutsche Bioscop Gesellschaft merged with Erich Pommer's Decla-Film GmbH to form ‚ÄûDecla Bioscop‚Äú. In 1928, Decla-Bioscop merged with Universum Film AG (Ufa) which had been founded in 1917. This company built the large studio (which is now known as the \\"Marlene Dietrich Halle\\") in 1926 for the major film production of Metropolis by Fritz Lang. The first German sound stage in Babelsberg, the Tonkreuz, was built during 1929, to make use of the Tri-Ergon sound-on-film process to which Ufa acquired the rights. Ufa's first successful full-sound film Melodie des Herzens/Melody of the Heart with Willy Fritsch was in fact made in Hungary in 1929, although this was followed in April 1930 by the premiere of The Blue Angel (which was made at Babelsberg) by Josef von Sternberg, with Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings in the main roles. From 1933 to 1945, around 1,000 feature films were made in the studios and on the studio lot. Under the direction of Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, the studio churned out hundreds of films including Leni Riefenstahl's openly propagandistic Triumph of the Will (1935). The virulently anti-Semitic propaganda film Jud S√ºss (The Jew S√ºss) (1940), was also made at Babelsberg.Spiegel, 09/06/07 On May 17, 1946 the DEFA (Deutsche Film AG) was established, producing over 800 feature films, including 150 children's films. In addition, over 600 films were made for television from 1959 to 1990. The DEFA period was honored by a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York City in 2005. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Treuhand took over the responsibility for the privatisation of the former DEFA. In August 1992, the Treuhandanstalt sold the former DEFA film studios in Babelsberg to the French group Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Eaux (later absorbed into Vivendi Universal). Over the following 12 years the company invested around ‚Ç¨500 million updating the studio's infrastructure. In July 2004, Vivendi sold Studio Babelsberg to the investment company FBB (Filmbetriebe Berlin Brandenburg GmbH), which has Carl Woebcken and Christoph Fisser as shareholders. In Spring of 2005, the restructured studio presented an initial public offering and began trading on the free market. 2007 was the most profitable year since the Studio's privatization in 1992 - 12 feature films were shot at Studio Babelsberg, among them Valkyrie with Tom Cruise, The International with Clive Owen, and The Reader with Kate Winslet. In 2008 Studio Babelsberg and Hollywood producer Joel Silver formed a strategic alliance to produce feature films from the Dark Castle production slate at the world‚Äôs oldest film studio. Recent co-productions of Studio Babelsberg include Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (released 2009), Roman Polanski's The Ghost Writer (2010), Brian De Palma's Passion (2012), and George Clooney's The Monuments Men (2014).

Its worship and beliefs are influenced by Oriental, Eastern, and Western traditions, and considers itself to be one \\"self-governing\\" church out of many in the Orthodox tradition. The OCCA is a standing member of the International Council of Community Churches (ICCC). International Council of Community Churches Clergy and sacraments The clergy ordained by the denomination operate their ministries independently from the denomination. According to a statement on the OCCA website: The OCCA, while claiming to be Catholic (\\"universal\\") but existing in many countries, accepts both men and women, married and unmarried, as candidates for ordination to all three orders of the apostolic ministry (deacons, priests, and bishops). The OCCA (often called the LGBT Church) ordains openly lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons as clergy and blesses their unions as it does those of heterosexual couples. Access to the seven sacraments is offered to all individuals regardless of sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. The OCCA has two monastic (religious) communities. Monasticism within the jurisdiction takes either a Western, Eastern or Oriental form just as the liturgical identity of the church as a whole represents itself. History The Orthodox-Catholic Church of America was established in the United States in 1892 under the mandate of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch, Ignatius Peter IV. The founding archbishop, Joseph Ren√© Vilatte (ordained as Mar Timotheus), had been ordained as a priest by Bishop Ernst Herzog of the Old Catholic Church in Bern, Switzerland on June 7, 1885.Joseph Ren√© Vilatte ‚Äì First Independent Catholic Prelate in North America. Archived from the original on April 24, 2010. Retrieved 2017-07-31. Working in the Great Lakes area, predominantly in Wisconsin, Fr. Vilatte sought to bring about the return of a Western Rite of Orthodoxy. Fr. Vilatte received both support and opposition in this attempt, but eventually he was consecrated as archbishop for North America, in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)Theriault, Serge A., 2006. Msgr. Rene Vilatte: Community Organizer of Religion (1854‚Äì1929). Berkeley: Apocryphile Press. by Archbishop Francis Alvarez with the permission of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch in 1892. The history of the OCCA is grounded, therefore, both in the East and West. In the 19th century, the Indian branch of the Syriac Orthodox Church began ordaining local priests for the Western Rite in order to supply ministers for their Western Rite congregations. Among these were Bishops Julius Alvarez, Paul Athanasius, Paul Evanious, and George Gregorius (the latter later canonized as St. Gregorius Geverghese). Father Vilatte was ordained by them as Mar Timotheus and appointed as Metropolitan for the newly formed American diocese. The synod of the American archdiocese declared itself autocephalous (self-governing) in 1910. Soon after his return to the United States, Vilatte formed a synod of bishops with himself at its head. When Vilatte retired, his co-adjutor, Frederick E. J. Lloyd, was elected archbishop and metropolitan. The following year Vilatte consecrated George Alexander McGuire to the episcopacy. In 1928, McGuire consecrated one of Lloyd's priests who was serving in New York City, William Tyarks, as bishop; he also joined the synod but McGuire deposed him in 1932 and consecrated Clement Sherwood as the new archbishop of his American Orthodox Catholic Church, which functioned as an Eastern Rite diocese of the joint synod. Sherwood, who had been ordained presbyter by Archbishop Lloyd, was originally consecrated bishop by Tyarks, but after the latter's deposition, requested that McGuire conditionally reconsecrate him. The following year Lloyd died and Sherwood became his successor. Sherwood remained a member of the AOC synod until he died in 1969. In 1957 he consecrated George Augustine Hyde to the episcopacy. In 1970, Hyde was elected and enthroned as metropolitan archbishop. Hyde was the first cleric in the United States to establish a parish (in Atlanta in 1946) for LGBT Christians. He retired in 1980 with the subsequent election of Alfred Louis Lankenau (1930‚Äì2010) as metropolitan archbishop. Under Lakenau the synod of the church agreed to the ordination of women. Lakenau retired in 1999 and was succeeded by E. Paul Brian Carsten who died in March 2009. On June 1, 2009, Bishop Peter (Robert Zahrt) was elected and enthroned as the metropolitan Archbishop of the jurisdiction. Upon his retirement in 2016, Bishop Paul (Ken Waibel) was elected as metropolitan in 2016. On November 11, 2018, Archbishop Paul resigned from the position of primate and from the OCCA. , the synod of bishops is working to discern whether or not a metropolitan archbishop is needed for church governance. Wider connections In 1921 Vilatte ordained the first African-American bishop, George Alexander McGuire, for the African Orthodox Missionary District of New York, which later became the African Orthodox Church. Saints The OCCA has canonized two saints: St. David Edwards, a former priest of the OCCA, and St. Fr. Mychal Judge, O.F.M., a Catholic Franciscan friar and firehouse chaplain who was the first identified victim of the September 11 attacks in 2001.Saints of the Orthodox- Catholic Church of America. Archived from the original on June 29, 2010. Retrieved 2017-07-31. Name In May 1891, Bishop Vladimir (Sokolovsky), the head of the Russian Orthodox Church in the United States, referred to Fr. Vilatte's flock as \\"true 'Old Catholic-Orthodox Christians' [now] under the patronage of our Church\\". This concept that the church was truly both Old Catholic (Western) and Orthodox was translated by this jurisdiction into the name \\"Orthodox-Catholic\\". The concept is that of a church with Western liturgy and Eastern (Orthodox) spirituality and theology.

He attended high school in Michigan, and was signed by the Houston Colt .45s while playing for the school's baseball team. After a season in the minor leagues, he was promoted to the Colt .45's active roster, and played in one game at the end of the 1963 Houston Colt .45s season. In that game, he had three hits and two walks. However, injuries cut his career short; he missed most of 1964 and 1965 due to surgery, and retired after playing parts of four more seasons in the minors. He returned to school, graduated from the University of Houston, and became a physical education teacher after retiring. Paciorek is rare among Major League Baseball players in having a perfect batting average of 1.000. He is the only player to achieve this distinction with more than two turns at-bat. Early life Paciorek was born in Detroit on February 11, 1945. His father was a factory worker in Plymouth, Michigan. He was the oldest of eight children; two of his brothers, Tom and Jim, went on to have MLB careers as well. He attended St. Ladislaus High School in Hamtramck, Michigan, and was named to the varsity baseball team as a freshman. During his high school career, he focused on strength building to achieve his dream of being a baseball player. By the time he graduated, he went from to , and was an all-state three-sport star in baseball, football, and basketball. Paciorek also played on Detroit's team in the National Amateur Baseball Federation; he was named most valuable player during the annual tournament in 1962. While he was still in high school, Houston general manager Paul Richards convinced Paciorek to sign with the Colt .45s; the two agreed to a $45,000 contract. Baseball career In late 1962, Paciorek attended an instructional league put on by Houston, which led to him becoming part of the team's spring training roster as one of 63 invited players. During exhibition play, he \\"hit everything in sight\\", and had a batting average of over .300. After spring training ended, he began his professional career with the Modesto Colts of the California League and played in 78 games for the team with a .219 batting average and 15 doubles. Late in the season, he injured his back and shoulder; he was diagnosed with a sciatic nerve injury, and was told to rest. Shortly afterward, however, Houston brought Paciorek and seven other rookies onto the major league roster to play in the season finale on September 29. (Two days earlier, the Colts had started an all-rookie lineup; to date, the only time an MLB club has attempted this. The starting pitcher for Houston that day was 17-year-old Jay Dahl, marking his only big-league appearance.) Paciorek, who was the starting right fielder, began the day with a walk in the second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had a walk in the sixth, and ended the day with a leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 13-4 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 as a result of his performance that day, something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done. Thanks in part to his performance in the final game of Houston's season, Paciorek was invited to spring training for Houston in 1964. His performances included a bases-loaded triple against the Mets. However, his poor play on both offense and defense late in spring training led to him being cut despite being nearly a lock to make the roster. He spent part of the year on the Durham Bulls and Statesville Colts, where he had a .135 batting average in 49 combined games. Partway through the year, he had spinal fusion surgery, which caused Paciorek to miss the rest of the 1964 season, as well as all of 1965. Paciorek returned to the Houston organization in 1966, and split the season with the Batavia Trojans and Salisbury Astros, where he hit .193 in 77 combined games. The following year, he played for the Asheville Tourists and Cocoa Astros, had a .104 average in 32 games, and was released at season's end. He was given a second chance to return to the major leagues when the Cleveland Indians, who were scouting his brother Tom at the University of Houston, signed him to a minor league contract with a spring training invitation. He spent 1968 with the Single-A Reno Silver Sox and the Rock Hill Indians, and hit .268 with 20 home runs in 95 total games; his 17 home runs with Reno led the team. Paciorek was promoted the following year to the Double-A Waterbury Indians and played in 29 games with them, but tore his achilles tendon during warm-ups, which led to his release and the end of his professional career. Post-baseball career After his baseball career ended, Paciorek returned to school and earned a degree in physical education from the University of Houston, a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and All There is to Know About Hitting.

This is the sole remaining section of the railway which once spanned over 46 miles with lines to Peel in the west, Ramsey in the north and the mining village of Foxdale in the centre of the island. Origins The crossing point was established with the opening of the line on 1 August 1874 where the railway bisected a small road between the main Colby to Port Erin Road and the coast road passing the nearby Kentraugh House; it became an unofficial stopping place for the local populace shortly afterwards and by 1877 plans had been made to provide a substantial crossing keepers' hut which was later accompanied by a keepers' lodge house. The surrounding rural area grew although initially the stop was not mentioned officially in any timetable literature. Locale This diminutive request stop serves the hamlets or individual houses of Level (Rushen), Croit-E-Caley, Kentraugh, Ballagawie and Ballakillowey. The 1 km section of line from the previous station (Colby) is straight and has a level crossing for Kentraugh Farm in the centre of it; to the west, towards Port St Mary, the line curves to the left on the approach to the next crossing for Ballagawne Farm and continues to Four Roads crossing. In more recent times a housing estate called Strawberry Field has been established a short distance from the halt, this was installed by the local authority. Until recently the road that leads to the level crossing also served the local Level Garage and until well into the 1990s trains carried motor parts from Douglas for dropping off at this point; the garage was closed in 2000 and the site has since been redeveloped into residential housing. The village that has built up around the level crossing site has been expanded considerably since the arrival of the railway making the halt frequently utilised during the summer months. A large private residential dwelling was established directly behind the station site from 2004 and this now dominates the railway premises with tall conifer trees; the area is now somewhat more residential than before. Naming Origin The title is believed to derive from the once prolific mining activity in the surrounding area, being a reference to the \\"level\\" of one of the mine adits; the mine ruins are still discernible in the hills directly above the area. It is one of two areas that carry the colloquial name, the other being Level Rushen, although the two are often confused as they are in the same sheading of the island. The name was adopted by the railway when the site officially became a request stop as early as 1928 when it first appeared in the timetable. Today the painted running-in board declares the halt as The Level (bilingual since 2008 to include the Yn Laare translation into the gaelic) but in the past it has been variously called Colby Level, Level, Level (Rushen) etc., and a metal nameboard stating Colby Level - Crossing installed in 1973 remained in place until 2013; the timetable uses \\"The Level\\" in all literature. The origin of the name comes from the stretch of main road at the top of the lane that leads from the level crossing, being a straight level section when macadamed, the name being used in local parlance ever since. The halt is usually timetabled in the railway's literature but the 2011 timetable for example omits to give the stopping places; the halt however remains open as a request stop despite this. It is also called the level due to the adit level at Colby, as part of the Ballacorkish mine near Colby. Today, all references to \\"Colby\\" are removed from timetabling literature in order to avoid confusion with Colby Station itself which is a mandatory stopping place whereas The Level remains a request stop only. Crossing The gated crossing was manned by a dedicated gatekeeper who lived in the adjacent house; latterly when the railway's operation became seasonal a part-time member of staff would man the crossing until the installation of automatic barriers which were introduced in 2002 and the manually operated gates removed. Since then the crossing keeper's hut has been unmanned but remains in situ housing storage facilities for the railway out of season. At that time a section of raised platform, of just one coach length, was also installed at the request of a regular passenger. The dwelling that lies opposite the crossing lodge was once the gatekeepers' house, though this was sold off by the railway in 1972. Restoration & Listing 2013 In February 2013 the crossing lodge and its environs were restored by volunteers from the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association, the only charity dedicated to the continued restoration and operation of the railway; the project marked a return to active \\"hands-on\\" railway volunteering by the group after a considerable break for a number of reasons. The lodge was restored, new period signage fitted and the surrounding area smartened up, the opportunity also being taken to standardise the naming (see above) so that all literature and notices refer to it as \\"The Level\\" rather than any of the previous connotations used. This name was chosen following historical research into contemporary documentation which shows this as the most-used title for the request stop over many years. Further projects by this group have included similar works at other wayside locations such as Four Roads and Mill Road, as well as their work base in the goods shed at Castletown Station. In 2013 the building was successfully added to the island's list of protected buildings, being one of very few such crossing lodges remaining and deemed to be of historical and cultural significance; other buildings along the line are being similarly treated thanks to the endeavours of local preservationists. Similar structures at Four Roads, Ballagawne and Ballasalla have had similar applications made on the grounds of their historical importance, as well as several of the main stations, notably Castletown and Port St. Mary. Further Refurbishment 2020 In a follow up to their initial works in 2013, volunteers from the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association revisited the site following easement of Covid-19 restrictions in July 2020 and once again repaired and repainted the diminutive halt, opting for a uniform maroon appearance and working in conjunction with the island's Department of Infrastructure to ensure some deteriorating woodwork was replaced; the opportunity was also taken to add some traditional railway concrete plant pots along the platform and replace the station's running in board which was time-expired.

Its population was \\"left devastated by a massacre in 1811 by sea otter hunters\\". Its last surviving member was given the name Juana Maria, who was born before 1811 and died in 1853. History Artifacts from San Nicolas Island, possibly of Nicole√±o origin Archaeological evidence suggests San Nicolas island , like the other Channel Islands, has been populated for at least 10,000 years, though perhaps not continuously. It is thought the Nicole√±o people were closely related to the people of Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands; these were members of the Takic branch of the Uto-Aztecan people and were related to the Tongva of modern-day Los Angeles County. The name Nicole√±o has been conventional since its use by Alfred L. Kroeber in Handbook of Indians of California; the Chumash called them the Niminocotch and called San Nicolas Ghalas-at. Their name for themselves is unknown. 1896 image of Nicole√±o remains on San Nicolas island The expedition of Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo spotted San Nicolas Island in 1543, but they did not land or make any notes about the inhabitants. In 1602 the Spanish explorer Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no visited San Nicolas and gave it its current name. Little is known of the Nicole√±o through the historical record between that date and the early 19th century. By that time, the population appeared to have declined significantly, likely due in part to Spanish missionary recruitment efforts, known to have relocated people from the other Channel Islands to the mainland.Juana Maria, the last surviving member of the Nicole√±o peopleIn 1811, a party of Aleuts and Russian fur traders from Russian Alaska landed on San Nicolas island in search of sea otter and seal. They killed many of the Nicole√±o men and raped many of the women leaving the population decimated. By the 1830s only around twenty remained; some sources put the number at seven, six women and an old man named Black Hawk. Black Hawk suffered a head injury during the massacre. Hearing of this, the Santa Barbara Mission on the mainland sponsored a rescue mission, and in late 1835 Captain Charles Hubbard sailed out to the Channel Islands aboard the schooner Peor es Nada. Most of the tribe boarded the ship, but one, the woman later known as Juana Maria, did not arrive before a storm rose and the ship had to return to port. Hubbard was unable to return for Juana Maria at the time as he had received orders to take a shipment of lumber to Monterey, California, and before he could return to Santa Barbara the Peor es Nada hit a heavy board in the mouth of the San Francisco Bay and sank. A lack of other available ships is usually cited as preventing further rescue attempts. Many of the surviving Nicole√±o chose to live at the Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel. However, they had no immunity to the diseases they encountered there. Black Hawk became blind shortly after arriving, and died when he fell off a steep bank into the water and drowned. The others had also apparently died by the time Juana Maria was rescued. After several other attempts at locating her failed, she was found by Captain George Nidever, who took her to the mainland. None of the local Indians could translate her language, and she was taken in by Nidever and his wife. However, she contracted dysentery and died only seven weeks after her arrival. In 1939, the remnants of a whalebone structure attributed to the Lone Woman were documented by Arthur Woodward.Morgan, Ron. 1979. An Account of the Discovery of a Whale-Bone House on San Nicolas Island. Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology 1:171-176 In 2009, two Nicole√±o redwood boxes were found eroding from a sea cliff by University of Oregon archaeologist Jon Erlandson, with a whale rib marker on top of them. The boxes and associated artifacts were salvaged by Erlandson, Ren√© Vellanoweth, Lisa Thomas-Barnett, and Troy Davis, with the contents of the boxes meticulously excavated by Vellanoweth and Thomas-Barnett in a San Nicolas Island archaeology lab. This cache produced roughly 200 artifacts of Nicole√±o, Euro-American, and Native Alaskan materials or styles.Erlandson, Jon M., Lisa Thomas Barnett, Ren√© L. Vellanoweth, Steven Schwartz, and Daniel Muhs. 2013. \\"From the Island of the Blue Dolphins: A Unique Nineteenth-Century Cache Feature From San Nicolas Island, California\\". Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology 8:66‚Äì78. The historic artifacts found in the boxes suggests that the cache dates to between AD 1815 and 1853 and may very well have been used by the Lone Woman.Erlandson, Jon M. and Ren√© L. Vellanoweth. 2015. \\"Rising Seas, Coastal Erosion, and Archaeological Discovery\\". In First Coastal Californians, edited by L. Gamble, pp. 110-113. Santa Fe: SAR Press. In 2012, a U.S. Navy archaeologist reported finding a site that could have been Juana Maria's cave. Over the years, 469 human remains and 436 burial objects have been found on San Nicolas Island. When leaders from the Pechanga Band of Luise√±o Mission Indians, a tribe of Luise√±os claiming a cultural connection with the Nicole√±os, visited the island, they were troubled with the way that the human remains were being handled by excavators. With the approval of the Navy, they established a cultural claim to the human remains and artifacts related to burial. Culture Most information about the Nicole√±o comes through Juana Maria. When Nidever located her, she was living in a round brush enclosure, about in diameter and high, with a narrow opening on one side. She cooked her food over a fire inside her home. Several similar enclosures were still standing at the time, and another type of structure, made of brush walls supported by whale ribs, was also found. Juana Maria hung seal meat from a series of long poles placed around the structures, or from ropes stretched between the poles. Like other California natives, the Nicole√±o were apparently skilled basket weavers, and Juana Maria is described as making four different shapes. When found she was wearing a dress made of cormorant skins, decorated with feathers. She had a number of possessions made of sinew and bone. The first archaeological visit to San Nicolas was by Paul Schumacher for the Smithsonian Institution in 1875. His team uncovered numerous artifacts from surface sites, assumed to be from a later period of Nicole√±o culture, as the island's climate is not well suited for preservation. Artifacts collected by these early visitors include grass matting and clothing fragments, bone knives and fishhooks, and soapstone fish and bird effigies.Meighan, Clement W.; and Eberhart, Hal (October 1953). \\"Archaeological Resources of San Nicolas Island, California.\\" American Antiquity, Vol. XIX (2), pp. 109‚Äì225. Nicole√±o culture was entirely dependent on the ocean for sustenance, as the island was home to only four types of land animals, none of which were valuable for food. The island is home to a large abundance of fish and sea mammals, as well as birds, which the Nicole√±o were skilled at catching. Language The Nicole√±o language has been extinct since Juana Maria's death. Its extant remnants consist only of four words and two songs attributed to her. This evidence was recorded by non-speakers, as contemporary accounts are clear that no one could be found who could understand Juana Maria. The four Nicole√±o words that were translated were \\"tocah\\", meaning \\"animal hide\\", \\"nache\\", meaning \\"man\\", \\"toygwah\\", meaning \\"sky\\", and \\"puoochay\\", meaning \\"body\\". Based on the limited evidence, Alfred L. Kroeber in 1907 identified it as a \\"Shoshonean\\" language ‚Äì a deprecated term for Northern Uto-Aztecan languages ‚Äì and associated it with the Takic branch that includes Tongva (Gabrieli√±o), spoken on Santa Catalina Island and the adjacent coast, and Luise√±o, spoken to the south.

Passengers wishing to board the train here can signal the driver to stop the train; to alight from the train the guard must be notified in advance. Location and environs The halt is situated behind the Ronaldsway Industrial Estate beside the Silverburn River at the midway point between the stations at Ballasalla and Castletown. Ronaldsway is the site of the Battle of Ronaldsway in 1275, which saw the Isle of Man transfer from Norse rule to Scottish rule; keills were excavated here and these now form part of historical displays at the Story Of Mann in Douglas. On the west side of the halt is a large field known as the Great Meadow which was once a horse racing track and later played host to the island's annual southern agricultural show; there were special trains for both these events. History The halt was introduced in 1967, to compete for airport traffic with buses and taxis. At that time there was just a simple nameboard, and the halt was mentioned only intermittently in timetables. As part of a major overhaul of the entire line as part of an all-island sewerage network in 2001, a pipeline was laid beneath the railway line and the permanent way completely replaced, the halt received a small waiting platform consisting of built up sleepers. Traffic Steam train arriving at Ronaldsway Halt from Douglas in 2006. Because of the short walk from the airport, air passengers leave and board trains here; it is also a popular drop-off spot for walkers, being close to the Millennium Way footpath established in 1979. Nameboard The halt's name is that of the nearby airport. For the 1971 season only it was re-titled as Great Meadow Halt in reference to the large field and one-time race course that lies adjacent to the halt. When bilingual Manx/English nameboards were introduced on the line, a replacement nameboard was added in 2009 showing the Manx Gaelic name of Staad Roonysvie and is still there today.

The first episode aired on 7 May 2006 on BBC Three and appeared at number eight on the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) top ten of most watched BBC Three programmes for that week. The show made only one more entry on the chart for the rest of the first series, when it reached number nine, some two weeks later. A second series was produced, with studio recordings taking place between May and July 2007. The first two episodes aired back-to-back on BBC Three on Sunday 5 August. Unlike the first series, the second series displayed more adult humour, including more intense sexual references. The first episode of the second series appeared at number eight in the BARB weekly top ten for BBC Three, with the second episode which aired immediately afterward, at number nine.

Biography Doeff was born in Amsterdam. As a young man, he sailed to Japan as a scribe for the Dutch East India Company. He became chief of the Dejima post in 1803, succeeding Willem Wardenaar, who was Director from 1800 to 1803. Doeff remained in Japan until 1817, when Jan Cock Blomhoff succeeded him. After Britain captured the Dutch colony in Indonesia in 1811, Dejima became the only place in the world flying the Dutch flag. Doeff steadfastly defended against British attempts to take over the Dejima post. The Netherlands was restored in 1815, and Doeff was later decorated for his loyalty and courage. Doeff wrote a Dutch-Japanese dictionary, and a memoir of his experiences in Japan, titled Recollections of Japan. He was notable for his strong activity in maintaining the Dutch trade monopoly in Japan. He is the first westerner known to have written haiku, two of which have been found in Japanese publications from the period of his stay in Japan.Max Verhart, \\"Haiku in the Netherlands and Flanders\\", German Haiku Society websiteOtterspeer, W. Leiden Oriental Connections, 1850-1940, Volume 5 of Studies in the History of Leiden University, Brill, 1989, . p 360 One of his haiku: :„Ç§„Éä„ÉÖ„Éû „Éé :Inadsma no :„Ç´„Éí„Éä „É≤ „Ç´„É©„É≥ :Ka√øna Wo karan :„ÇØ„Çµ „Éû„ÇØ„É© :Koesa Makura. :lend me your arms, :fast as thunderbolts, :for a pillow on my journey The Phaeton incident After the French had annexed the Batavian Republic in 1806 and Napoleon had begun to use its resources against Great Britain, Royal Navy ships started to prey on Dutch shipping. In 1808, HMS Phaeton, under the command of Captain Fleetwood Pellew, entered Nagasaki's harbour to ambush a couple of Dutch trading ships that were expected to arrive shortly. The Phaeton entered the harbour on 14 October surreptitiously under a Dutch flag. Despite the arrival of the \\"Dutch\\" ships being later in the season than normal, the Japanese and Dutch representatives didn't seem to suspect anything suspicious. So, as was the custom, Dutch representatives from the Nagasaki trading enclave of Dejima rowed out to welcome the visiting ship, but as they approached, Phaeton lowered a tender to capture the Dutch representatives, while their Japanese escorts jumped into the sea and fled. The Phaeton, threatening to execute the Dutch representatives, demanded that supplies (water, food, fuel) be delivered to her in exchange for their lives. The Phaeton also fired cannons and muskets to press her demands, and threatened to destroy the Japanese and Chinese ships in the harbour. Because the harbor cannon defenses were so old, and most couldn't even fire, the meager Japanese forces in Nagasaki were seriously outgunned and unable to intervene.Samurai Archives Podcast EP09 \\"Maritime Defense of Nagasaki During the Edo Period\\". Retrieved August 13, 2013. At the time, it was the Saga clan's turn to uphold the policy of sakoku and to protect Nagasaki, but they had economized by stationing only 100 troops there, instead of the 1,000 officially required for the station. The Nagasaki Magistrate, Matsudaira Genpei, immediately ordered troops from Ky≈´sh≈´. The Japanese mobilized a force of 8,000 samurai and 40 ships to confront the Phaeton, but it would take them a few days to arrive. In the meantime, the Nagasaki Magistrate provided supplies to the British. The Phaeton left two days later on 17 October, before the arrival of Japanese reinforcements, and after the crew had learned that the Dutch trading ships would not be coming that year. They also left a letter for Doeff. The Nagasaki Magistrate, Matsudaira, took responsibility by committing suicide by seppuku. Following Phaetons visit, the Bakufu reinforced coastal defenses and promulgated a law prohibiting foreigners coming ashore, on pain of death (1825-1842, Muninen-uchikowashi-rei). The Bakufu also requested that official interpreters learn English and Russian, departing from their prior focus on Dutch studies.

He umpired in four World Series and in four All-Star Games. Early life Boggess was born in Terrell, Texas, and attended Waco High School in Waco, Texas. He played pro baseball for a Cleburne, Texas team under the fitting alias of \\"Bogus\\" at age 16. He was disqualified from high school competition when this was discovered. Minor leagues He enjoyed a minor league playing career through 1933, primarily in the St. Louis Cardinals system. During that time, he played every field position; on three occasions he played every position in a single game. He was also a manager in his last two seasons, and in 1932 he spent his life savings on a minor league team, the Muskogee Chiefs of the Class C Western Association. He operated the team virtually singlehandedly, but the venture failed financially in the midst of the Great Depression. After the 1933 season he turned to officiating amateur baseball, basketball and football games. His first chance in baseball's minor leagues came in 1939, and he had to hitchhike from Texas to South Dakota to begin work. A bout with high blood pressure in 1943 delayed his entry to the major leagues for a year. Major league career After reaching the majors, he officiated in the World Series in 1950, 1952 (outfield only), 1956 and 1960, serving as crew chief for the last; he was the second base umpire for Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 Series. He also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1946, 1952, 1955 and 1960 (both games), calling balls and strikes for the second half of the first 1960 game, and in the three-game playoffs to determine the NL champion in 1946, 1959 and 1962. He was the home plate umpire on July 31, 1954, when Joe Adcock hit four home runs and a double, and was the first base umpire for the first of Sandy Koufax' four no-hitters on June 30, 1962. Upon retiring in 1962, he received the first Bill Klem Award from the Houston chapter of the BBWAA as baseball's top umpire. Later life Boggess, who also worked as a scout for the Chicago White Sox as well as the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, later became a brewery representative. He wrote an autobiography, Kill the Ump!: My 42 Years in Baseball, in which he controversially suggested that the Los Angeles Dodgers had blown the 1962 NL pennant by focusing on Maury Wills' pursuit of the single-season stolen base record. Boggess died of a lung ailment at age 64 in Dallas' Parkland Hospital, and was buried in Dallas' Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery with a souvenir baseball he had kept which was autographed by every other umpire with whom he had worked.

She also appeared in several episodes of the British TV serial State of Play. Career In 1999, Wightman starred in the British films The Feather Room and Romeo Thinks Again, with the latter production featuring Wightman as Juliet. In 2001, Wightman co-starred in the mystery film Gosford Park directed by Robert Altman. She portrayed Lady Lavinia, the sister of Kristin Scott Thomas's character and the wife of Lt. Commander Anthony Meredith (played by Tom Hollander). That year, Wightman also appeared in Revelation alongside James D'Arcy and Terence Stamp. Directed and written by Stuart Urban, the British adventure film features a team searching for an ancient relic once possessed by the Knights Templar. Wightman plays Mira, an alchemist. In 2003, Wightman acted in several episodes of the British TV serial State of Play. The 2005 British film Mouth to Mouth, directed by Alison Murray, includes Wightman as Rose, the incompetent mother of the protagonist Sherry (played by Ellen Page). The following year, Wightman appeared in the dystopian political thriller V for Vendetta as Valerie Page.

The actress stated that during Valerie's incarceration, \\"She finds something, her integrity, which they can't take from her. She'd almost died and then come alive again through what she found in herself.\\" Wightman shaved her head for the role, and felt this decision helped display prejudice faced by many lesbians.

Farming and industry were almost nonexistent; transportation and communications were primitive; banking, services, and trade were almost exclusively in the hands of Chinese or other foreigners. Most of the people were illiterate nomadic herders, and a large part of the male labour force lived in the monasteries, contributing little to the economy. Property in the form of livestock was owned primarily by aristocrats and monasteries; ownership of the remaining sectors of the economy was dominated by Chinese or other foreigners. Mongolia's new rulers thus were faced with a daunting task in building a modern, socialist economy.  Periods  = 1921‚Äì1939 = Mongolia's economic development under communist control can be divided into three periods: 1921‚Äì1939; 1940‚Äì1960; and 1961 to the present. During the first period, which the Mongolian government called the stage of \\"general democratic transformation,\\" the economy remained primarily agrarian and underdeveloped. After an abortive attempt to collectivize herders, livestock remained in private hands. The state began to develop industry based on processing of animal husbandry products and crop raising on state farms. Transportation, communications, domestic and foreign trade, and banking and finance were nationalized with Soviet assistance; they were placed under the control of Mongolian state and cooperative organizations or Mongolian-Soviet joint-stock companies. Ulan Bator became the nation's industrial center. = 1940‚Äì1960 = During the second period, called the \\"construction of the foundations of socialism,\\" agriculture was collectivized, and industry was diversified into mining, timber processing, and consumer goods production. Central planning of the economy began in 1931 with an abortive five-year plan and with annual plans in 1941; five-year plans began anew with the First Five-Year Plan (1948‚Äì52). Soviet, and after the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China forces over the Kuomintang forces in 1949, aid increased, allowing the construction of the Trans-Mongolian Railway (the Ulan bator Railroad), and various industrial projects. Although industrial development still was concentrated in Ulan bator, economic decentralization began with the completion of the Ulan bator Railroad and the establishment of food processing plants in Aimag centers. = 1960‚Äì1992 = The third stage, which the government called the \\"completion of the construction of the material and technical basis of socialism,\\" saw further industrialization and agricultural growth, aided largely by Mongolia's joining the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) in 1962. After the Sino- Soviet split, Chinese aid ceased, but continued with Soviet and Eastern European financial and technical assistance in the forms of credits, advisers, and joint ventures enabled Mongolia to modernize and to diversify industry, particularly in mining sector. New industrial centers were built in Baganuur, Choibalsan, Darkhan, and Erdenet, and industrial output rose significantly. Although animal husbandry was stagnant, crop production increased dramatically with the development of virgin lands by state farms. Foreign trade with Comecon nations grew substantially. Transportation and communications systems were improved, linking population and industrial centers and extending to more remote rural areas. By the late 1980s, Mongolia had developed into an agricultural-industrial economy, due to the efficiencies of a centrally planned and managed economy and communist foreign aid. Yet, Mongolian leaders decided to undertake a reform program modeled after the example of perestroika in the Soviet Union. Role of the government In the late 1980s, Mongolia had a planned economy based on socialist ownership of the means of production. According to the Constitution of the Mongolian People's Republic, socialist ownership has two forms: state ownership (of land and natural resources, economic facilities and infrastructure; and the property of all state organizations, enterprises, and institutions) and cooperative ownership (property of agricultural associations and other types of cooperatives). Private ownership was negligible in all sectors of the economy, except animal husbandry, but economic reforms adopted since 1986 gave greater leeway for individual and cooperative enterprises. The economy was directed by a single state national economic plan, which, when confirmed by the legislature, the State Great Khural, had the force of law. In accordance with the plan, the state annually drew up a state budget, which was confirmed and published in the form of a law. The Council of Ministers constitutionally was charged with planning the national economy; implementing the national economic plan and the state and local budgets; directing financial and credit policy; exercising a foreign trade monopoly; establishing and directing the activities of ministries and other state institutions concerned with economic construction; defending socialist production; and strengthening socialist ownership. In December 1987 and January 1988, the top-level state economic organizations under the Council of Ministers were reorganized. The State Planning and Economic Committee was formed out of the former State Planning Commission, the State Labor and Social Welfare Committee, the State Prices and Standards Committee, and the Central Statistical Board. New economic entities were the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry; the Ministry of Environmental Protection; the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Supply; the Ministry of Light Industry; and the Ministry of Power, Mining Industry, and Geology. Unaffected by the reorganization were the Ministry of Social Economy and Services, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transport, the State Construction Committee, and the State Bank of the Mongolian People's Republic. Local government organizations‚Äîthe executive committees of hurals‚Äîimplemented economic plans and budgets, directed economic construction, and supervised the work of economic and cooperative organizations at their level. Planning Planning in communist-run Mongolia had an inauspicious start with the Five-Year Plan for 1931‚Äì35, which set unrealistically high targets for production and called for the collectivization of agricultural production. This plan was abandoned in 1932 in the face of widespread resistance to collectivization and the failure to meet production goals. Annual planning was introduced in 1941 in an effort to deal with wartime shortages. Five-year plans were reintroduced in 1948 with the First Plan. The Second Five-Year Plan (1953‚Äì57) was followed by the Three- Year Plan (1958‚Äì60). Regular five-year plans were resumed with the Third Five- Year Plan (1961‚Äì65), and they continued to be used afterward. In the late 1980s, economic planning in Mongolia included long-term, five-year, and annual plans that operated on multiple levels. Planning originated with the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which produced the guidelines for economic and social development for the five-year period corresponding to the party's congress. Based on these guidelines, the Standing Commission on Economic- Budget Affairs of the People's Great Hural drafted the five-year national and annual economic plans, which were approved by the People's Great Hural and became law. The Council of Ministers directed and implemented national planning through the State Planning and Economic Committee and through the Ministry of Finance. Planning for different sectors of the economy was conducted by relevant ministries and state committees; local plans were drawn up by local governmental organizations. Mongolia's five-year plans were coordinated with those of the Soviet Union beginning in 1961 and with Comecon multilateral five-year plans beginning in 1976. Annual plan coordination with the Soviet Union, which was made official in signed protocols, began in 1971. Mongolian planners were trained by Soviet planners and cooperated with them in drafting long-term plans, such as the General Scheme for the Development and Location of the Mongolian People's Republic Productive Forces up to 1990, produced in the late 1970s; and the Longterm Program for the Development of Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation Between the Mongolian People' Republic and the USSR for the Period up to 2000, signed in 1985. National economic plans included general development goals as well as specific targets and quotas for agriculture, capital construction and investment, domestic and foreign trade, industry, labor resources and wages, retail sales and services, telecommunications, and transportation. The plans also focused on such social development goals and targets as improved living standards, population increase, cultural development, and scientific and technical development. Budget The Ministry of Finance prepared annual national budgets and provided guidance to the formulation of local budgets. The national budget included the budget of the central government, the budgets of aimag and city governments, and the budget of the national social insurance fund. The national budget grew with the expansion of the economy: In 1940 revenues were 123.9 million T√∂gr√∂g and expenditures, 122.1 million tugriks; in 1985 revenues were 5,743 million tugriks and expenditures, 5,692.5 million tugriks. The structure of the national budget changed between 1940 and 1985. In 1940 some 34.6 percent of revenues came from the turnover tax (a value added tax on each transaction), 7.8 percent from deductions from profits, 16.7 percent from taxes on the population, and 40.9 percent from other kinds of income. In 1985 nearly 63 percent of revenues came from the turnover tax, 29.9 percent from deductions from profits, 3.5 percent from deductions from the social insurance fund, 0.7 percent from taxes on the population, and 3.2 percent from other types of income. In 1940 some 21.9 percent of expenditures went to develop the national economy; 19.7 percent to social and cultural programs; and 58.4 percent to defense, state administration, reserves, and other expenses. In 1985 about 42.6 percent of expenditures went to developing the national economy; 38.7 percent to social and cultural programs; and 18.7 percent to defense, state administration, reserves, and other expenses. The proposed 1989 budget had revenues and expenditures of 6.97 billion tugriks. Proposed expenditures for 1989 included 1.8 billion tugriks for developing agriculture, 2.1 billion for industry, and 1.6 billion for capital investment. Of the 2.76 billion tugriks proposed for social and cultural development, 1.16 billion was to go for education; 597.5 million for health, physical culture, and sports; 259.7 million for science, culture, and art; and 747.4 million for the social insurance fund. Subsidies to maintain stable retail prices totaled 213 million tugriks. Local budgets, through which 70 percent of social and cultural expenditures were funneled, totaled 3.46 billion tugriks. Structure of the economy Socialist development transformed Mongolia from a predominantly agrarian, nomadic economy in 1921 into a developing, agricultural-industrial economy in the late 1980s. In 1985 a reported 18.3 percent of produced national income was derived from agriculture, 32.4 percent from industry, 4.9 percent from construction, 11.2 percent from transportation and communications, 31.6 percent from domestic trade and services, and 1.6 percent from other sectors. Sixty percent of disposable national income went to consumption, and 40 percent went to accumulation. Fixed assets totaled about 38.9 billion tugriks, of which 66.5 percent were productive fixed assets, including livestock, and 33.5 percent were nonproductive. Industry and construction accounted for 38.1 percent of the productive fixed assets; agriculture, 16 percent; transportation and communications, 9 percent; and domestic trade and services, 3.4 percent. Investment totaled 4.624 billion tugriks, 97.9 percent of which went to the state sector, and 2.1 percent, to the cooperative sector. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1981‚Äì85), 68.9 percent of investments went into the productive sectors of the economy, and 31.1 percent, into nonproductive sectors. Industry and construction received 44.7 percent of investment during this period; agriculture, 13.9 percent; transportation and communications, 9.0 percent; and domestic trade and services, 1.3 percent. The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1986‚Äì90) called for increasing produced national income by 26 to 29 percent and for raising investment by 24 to 26 percent, of which 70 percent was to go to developing material production. In the late 1980s, Mongolia was divided into three economic regions. The western region (Bayan-√ñlgii, Khovd, Uvs, Zavkhan, and Govi-Altai aimags), with 21 percent of the nation's population, was predominantly agricultural. The western region had 32 percent of Mongolia's livestock and produced about 30 percent of its wool and meat. Local industry was engaged in processing of animal husbandry products, timber, minerals, and building materials. Transportation was predominantly by motor vehicles. The central economic region (Arkhangai, Bayankhongor, Bulgan, Darkhan-Uul, Dornogovi, Dundgovi, Kh√∂vsg√∂l, √ñmn√∂govi, √ñv√∂rkhangai, Selenge, T√∂v aimags, and Ulan Bator) was the dominant producer. The region had 70 percent of Mongolia's population (including the cities of Darkhan, Erdenet, and Ulan Bator); 55 percent of its territory; 75 percent of its arable land; 90 percent of surveyed coal deposits; and 100 percent of copper, molybdenum, iron ore, and phosphate deposits. This region accounted for 80 percent of gross industrial production, 90 percent of light industrial production, and 80 percent of food industry production, 75 percent of coal production, and 100 percent of copper- molybdenum, iron ore, and phosphate mining. It also accounted for 60 percent of gross agricultural production, 60 percent of milk production, 50 percent of meat production, and 80 percent of grain, potato, and vegetable production. The eastern economic region (Dornod, Khentii, and S√ºkhbaatar aimags) had 9 percent of Mongolia's population, 20 percent of the arable land, and 15 percent of the livestock. The region contributed 15 percent of gross meat production and 13 percent of wool production. Grain production on large state farms hewed out of virgin lands contributed 90 percent of the region's agricultural output. The major industrial center was Choibalsan, which produced 50 percent of regional gross industrial output. Economic reforms In the late 1980s, dissatisfaction with the economic stagnation of the last years of the former regime of Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal and the influence of the Soviet perestroika led Mongolia to launch its own program of economic reforms. This program had five goals: acceleration of development; application of science and technology to production; reform of management and planning; greater independence of enterprises; and a balance of individual, collective, and societal interests. Acceleration of development in general was to result from the attainment of the other four goals. Scientific research was being redirected to better serve economic development, with electronics, automation, biotechnology, and the creation of materials becoming the priority areas of research and cooperation with Comecon countries. Reform of management and planning began in 1986 with the first of several rounds of reorganization of governmental bodies dealing with the economy. These changes rationalized and streamlined state economic organizations; reduced the number of administrative positions by 3,000; and saved 20 million tugriks between 1986 and 1988. The role of the central planning bodies was to be reduced by limiting the duties of the State Planning and Economic Committee to overseeing general capital- investment policy. The indicators specified in the five-year and the annual national economic plans also were to be decreased. State committees and ministries, rather than the State Planning and Economic Committee, were to decide upon machinery and equipment purchases. Decentralization of economic management also was to extend to aimag and city administrations and enterprises. These bodies were given greater autonomy in construction and production, and they also were held financially responsible for profits and losses. Efforts to devolve economic decision making to the enterprise level began in 1986, when more than 100 enterprises began experimenting with financial autonomy (before then, enterprises operating with a deficit had been subsidized by the state). Enterprises were accountable for their own losses, and they were responsible for fulfilling sales contracts and export orders. The draft law on state enterprises, presented to the People's Great Hural in December 1988, was to extend greater independence in economic matters to all state enterprises and to lead to an economy that combined planning and market mechanisms. Under provisions of the draft law, state enterprises were to be authorized to make their own annual and five-year plans and to negotiate with state and local authorities to pay taxes based on long-term quotas. State enterprises also were to sell output exceeding state orders and unused assets; to establish their own, or to cooperate with existing, scientific organizations to solve scientific and technical problems; to be financially responsible for losses, and to pay back bank loans; to set prices independently; to establish wage rates based on enterprise profitability; to purchase materials and goods from individuals, collectives, state distribution organizations, and wholesale trade enterprises; to establish direct ties with foreign economic organizations; to manage their own foreign currency; and to conduct foreign trade. The draft law stipulated that enterprises were to be divided into two categories. National enterprises were to be the responsibility of ministries, state committees, and departments; local enterprises were to be supervised by executive committees of aimag and city administrations or members of local hurals. State and local bodies were not to interfere in the day-to-day decision making of enterprises, but they were responsible for ensuring that enterprises obeyed the law and that they did not suppress the interests of society. Enterprises were allowed to form three kinds of associations: production associations, scientific production associations, and enterprise associations to coordinate economic affairs. Finally, the draft law said that the state was the owner of state enterprises and that the labor collective was the lawful manager of a state enterprise. The labor collective was to elect a labor collective council, which was to ensure that the enterprise director (who acted on behalf of the collective and the state) met the interests of the collective in managing the enterprise. It was unclear how the relationship between the enterprise director and the labor collective would work out in practice. Balancing the interests of society, the collective, and the individual entailed providing scope for individual and collective initiative to increase production and efficiency. Enlarging the scope for individual initiative had three aspects: linking wages to enterprise profitability, permitting output exceeding state plans to be sold for profit, and providing employment opportunities outside the state and the cooperative sectors. In 1988 wage scales dependent on enterprise revenues were introduced to the light and food industries and to the domestic trade sector, resulting in a reduction in materials utilized by those sectors. Beginning in late 1986, state farms and negdels (agricultural stations) were eligible for state payments for output exceeding the annual average growth rate for the previous five-year plan. Individual agricultural cooperative members and workers were allowed increasing numbers of privately held livestock. The draft law also stipulated that enterprises could sell production exceeding plan targets for their own profit. In 1987 the government began encouraging the formation of voluntary labor associations, auxiliary farms, and sideline production attached to enterprises, schools, and so forth to increase production of foodstuffs and consumer goods, to engage in primary processing of agricultural goods, and to provide services. The authorities permitted the formation of individual and family-based cooperatives; by 1988 there were 480 such cooperatives. Contracting among state farms and both agricultural cooperatives and families was permitted and was increasing in the late 1980s.

It forms part of the sole remaining section of the railway which once covered a network of some 46 miles across the island. Origins When first opened the station was complemented by a wooden station structure with corrugated iron roof similar to that which still exists at Santon Santon but at around the turn of the twentieth century this was replaced by the building which remains today. The village only received a station at all following public outcry when the proposed route was announced, with a request to deviate the line also being submitted, This was not carried out however, resulting in today's station being some distance from the heart of the village it serves. A small timber goods shed was provided in 1880 being of similar style to those elsewhere on the route. Hollywood The goods shed was used as the set for Burnett Stone's workshop on Muffle Mountain for the filming of Thomas and the Magic Railroad along with several other railway locations. The engines of the Isle of Man Railway however did not appear in the film. For filming purposes the interior of the shed was dressed to become a workshop where the engine Lady resided; at this time the fabric of the building was also restored, with new external doors and improved lighting. The exterior also saw use in 2001 when it was used for a night shoot for the Channel Four production of Cinderella which also featured the locomotive Caledonia, then carrying the deep blue livery. Sequences for various other productions have used the station in more recent times, these include The Ginger Tree in 1988, The Brylcreem Boys in 1999 and various episodes of documentaries featuring the island, notably Wish You Were Here... The building The imposing station building looking north. The impressive two-storey station building would lead the casual observer to think it to be the railway's terminus which is in fact just under a mile away at Port Erin; it was constructed by a local firm in 1898 to serve the large demand of tourists for whom the village was a popular resort. It is the only \\"proper\\" station on the line to not have a passing loop, owing to its close location to the southern terminus. The station remains under the ownership of the railway but has been largely out of use. In 1980 the station was converted by the company Campamarina for use in conjunction with their Trailblazers holiday scheme and was used as a hostel (the buildings at Castletown Station were similarly treated at the same time). At this time the railway passed over the use of the whole building, and the station staff were subsequently housed in a garden shed-type structure on the platform. When the usage change, the canopy structure that runs parallel to the platform was bricked in and remains so today, although latterly the station master is once again housed in the building itself, albeit in a smaller office using part of the original ladies' waiting room. The ground floor consists of a large reception room with open fireplace and toilet facilities; formerly there was a refreshment room here too. The upper storey is served by one staircase and has a row of bedrooms running from a corridor which runs along the railway side of the building. Today the upper storey lies empty. Station environs No. 4 Loch (1874) passing over the level crossing in 1988. The station, despite having no passing/run-round facilities, does boast a substantial goods shed served by a dedicated siding which was lifted in the 1979 but reinstated in 2002 at the same time as the whole of the permanent way was replaced along the line. When reinstated, the siding was not connected to the imposing goods shed, however in the winter of 2007/2008 rail connections were restored. A second siding which once served the rear of the shed was removed in 1974 and has not been replaced. Being some distance from the village, the nearest point of interest is the Station Hotel which lies behind the station. Also to the rear was the gasworks (closed and demolished in 2012) followed by a walk of some half mile before reaching the outskirts of the village. The first building of interest close to the station is the local primary school Schooil Purt Le Moirrey which was only established in the year 2000. Thereafter lies the village proper with its lines of shop fronts leading down to the harbour. A crossroads close to the station directs traffic either to the village, the coast at Gansey Bay or the folk museum at Cregneash and The Sound (latterly styled as Lands End Of Mann. Today No. 4 Loch (1874) at the station in 1979In keeping with current policy, the station received new bi-lingual nameboards in 2008 in a standard maroon and cream colour scheme (the previous colouring here had been black, white and grey). On the northerly side of the level crossing there is a gatekeepers cottage which is now a private dwelling. To the rear of the station is the Station Hotel. From August 2014 the station became unmanned for the remainder of the railway's season with passengers boarding and alighting purchasing tickets elsewhere. Train guards now operate the barriers which protect the line from the adjacent road to the village. During special events on the railway the station has been used as a drop off point for shuttle buses to Cregneash Folk Museum for Island At War each summer and the Heritage Open Days that are staged by Manx National Heritage each October. The goods shed remains in railway hands and is used for storage purposes only, housing one of three remaining closed vans until the winter of 2013 when this was moved to Port Erin to form part of a new display in the railway museum. The goods yard is used to store other railway items, notably the former railings from Port Erin Station. The station remains a popular drop off point for walkers who then use the coastal footpath beyond to reach Port Erin and return by rail in the summer months. It is also the nearest station for the national folklore museum to which a limited bus service is operated. Recent developments No. 12 Hutchinson (1908) at the station in 1991. Having been largely unoccupied for several years, the station masters' accommodation was relocated in the late 1990s to the building itself and the garden shed structure was removed. The building itself has been the subject of several restoration/conversion attempts but all of these have been fruitless to date. In 2008 a local developer is understood to have received permission to convert the building into apartments, whilst retaining the frontage of the platform area, removing the bricked-up canopy added in 1979 and restoring much of the charm of the railway-oriented site. This plan never came to fruition and the buildings were again placed on the market in 2012, and subsequently sold subject to planning, for conversion to offices. This application was denied on the grounds of insufficient parking and to date the station building lies empty while the shed remains in railway hands and used for storage. The station is currently up for sale and the former gasworks land to the rear is proposed to become another residential area following the closure of the works in 2012. The station remained manned by railway staff until the summer of 2014 and it is understood it will become unmanned from the 2015 season to reduce the railway's operating costs.

Until 1968 there were termini at both Peel and Ramsey in the west and north of the island respectively. Origins This station was the second established terminus of the Isle of Man Railway: the first opened at Peel in 1873. The railway initially considered building its southern route only as far as Castletown, to the east of Port Erin, but due to increasing tourism on the island, especially at the seaside resorts of Port Erin and the nearby Port St Mary, the line was extended all the way from Douglas to Port Erin, a distance of . The station soon established itself and became a focal point in the village, and it maintains this status today. Facilities were considerably expanded between 1902 and 1909, the site expanding to its greatest extent before the start of the First World War. Nameboards The station has historically carried a bilingual station nameboard reading \\"Purt √áhiarn/Port Erin\\" attached to the side of the locomotive shed; in 2008 following new policy, the other nameboards are also bilingual but these have been painted maroon and cream. This contrasts with the green and cream livery applied to the station area, but is consistent with the rest of the line. There are plans to change the station colour scheme to maroon as part of a corporate makeover of the whole railway. Crossings The station is unique in having a public right of way bisecting the long platform and, in bygone days, longer trains (rarely seen today) would have to uncouple whilst loading prior to departure to ensure the right of way to the nearby Athol Park was not blocked. At the eastern end of the station is a level crossing (one of only two crossings still manned on the railway) across Droghadfayle Road. Until the yard trackwork was relaid in 2000 the locomotive crew had to open and close the gates whilst \\"running round\\" to couple onto the train for departure, but this can now be done without disturbing traffic. Buildings No. 4 Loch outside the locomotive shed with the original water tower, 1979 Overview of the yard showing the locomotive shed, replacement water tower and goods shed in the distance, 2012 Viewed from the buffers showing the layout of the site with the 1909 station to the left and locomotive shed to the right, 2006 No. 13 Kissack (1910) outside the locomotive shed with the replacement water tower to the rear, 2007 =Original station (1874-1909)= On opening, the Port Erin terminus consisted of the mainline, a run-round loop, departure siding, and two further sidings one serving the original locomotive shed and the other for goods. The original station building was almost identical to the one that survives at Castletown, but was constructed of slate rubble. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the station facilities were all to the west of the pedestrian level crossing that bisects the later Edwardian station. The rather limited facilities reflected both the comparative newness of Port Erin as a seaside resort in the early 1870s, and also the financial difficulties faced by the Isle of Man Railway in completing the South Line. However, after the opening of the railway, Port Erin developed rapidly, overwhelming the original facilities which were systematically replaced from 1902 to 1905, with further extensions in 1912 and 1914. =Replacement station (1909)= The main station building is constructed of Ruabon brick and was constructed in 1909 in the centre of the village, replacing a similar original version that was slightly smaller and made of local stone. This building is something of a focal point in the village and houses a booking office, a waiting room which was once a ladies only facility and a caf√© in the former porters' office. This building was extended in the mid 20th century: the extension is now the mess room for locomotive crews, though it was built as a ticket office for Isle of Man Road Services, a subsidiary of the railway company. This extension, which also provides part of the station toilets, has in the past been home to the local Royal National Lifeboat Institution charity shop among others. It is proposed to remove the former bus office, install a new entrance to the station toilets from the street side of the building, and install a new canopy along the street side of the building. This will allow bus services to be moved from the present shelter on Bridson Road. =Locomotive shed (1907)= There is also a substantial locomotive shed constructed from local stone adjoining an old bus garage which is home to the railway museum, replacing the 1874 version which stood beside it; this shed was constructed at the turn of the century and houses an inspection pit and one set of rails with access at both ends. Between 1982 and 1998 it served as the goods shed and housed two disused locomotives, No. 8 Fenella and No. 9 Douglas, both of which were privately owned but could be viewed from the exhibition hall of the main museum. Throughout this time the goods shed was used for servicing and housing of service locomotives. =Goods shed (1908)= The goods shed was constructed at the turn of century in a similar style to the locomotive shed and also featured one road with doors at either end. Between 1982 and 1998 it was used as the locomotive shed, being fitted with an internal water tank and inspection pit for that reason. At this time is also lost its stone walling at the station end which was spar-dashed. When the railway museum received a major overhaul beginning in 1998 the shed was converted into the entrance hall and souvenir shop for the museum, regaining a stone gable with the addition of an entrance porch in a similar sympathetic style. =Restoration (1990-1991)= Following extensive refurbishment, the station won an Ian Allan Heritage Railway award in 1990, but since then only remedial work has been carried out to the station's intricate and distinctively carved wooden fascia boards and other paintwork. In 1999 the traditional \\"picket\\" style wooden fencing was removed from the platform area and replaced with tall metal security fencing (to protect the bus yard in the former platform area) which detracted from the picturesque setting. =Crossing hut (1998-2010)= A small timber-built sentry box also guarded the entrance to the station where it crosses the public highway at Droghadfayle Road and today this is used only for storage by the gatekeeper until the crossing was automated in the winter of 2012-2013. This structure replaced a much older version in 1998, which had previously seen use as an overspill ticket office at Douglas station prior to that point. =Bus depot (1975)= A large spar-dashed building in the middle of the site is the southern bus depot of Bus Vannin, erected in 1975 when the entire site was redeveloped, buses having previously been housed in what is now the railway museum. This structure was erected at the same time as the bay platform and sidings were lifted to create further bus storage. =Carriage shed (1998)= The station has a two-road carriage shed, also constructed in 1999, ensuring for the first time in the line's history that coaching stock stored overnight could be kept under cover; until this time the carriages were stored outdoors overnight on the platform, and latterly remained there in closed season attracting vandals. =Water tower (1998)= The stone-built water tower which serves the locomotive shed today was built in 1998 replacing a much older version which had been removed in 1986 and not replaced at the time. The tower is in a similar style to the original, being of local stone, and houses the station's oil store beneath the tank. It stands on the same site as the original but it slightly larger; a timber-built crew bothy stands behind it, this having been used as a temporary ticket office at Douglas station for the duration of the 2016 season while refurbishment was ongoing. =Regeneration (2016-2018)= Beginning in 2016 the station and its surroundings became part of South West Regeneration Scheme for the village; this has involved the repaving of the adjacent Station Road, removal of the perimeter walling (itself only installed in 1974 when the road was widened), and the removal of a canopy from the northwest gable of the building, this not being original. A replacement canopy in a similar style to that on the platform side of the building was installed and the former bus office (later Quilter's Haltsewing shop) demolished to create a larger paving area, the new canopy continuing round to the roadside of the building. An original feature, the miasma tower, long since removed, was reinstated atop the roof and track realigned onto a curve at the headshunt. A second phase was completed in early 2018 and has seen a sloped area leading to the adjacent railway museum created, effectively making a large new feature wall a central feature when viewed from the road. Foundations were also laid with the possibility of a short platform being added in the future beside the museum and locomotive; to date there are no plans to install this feature. Museum No. 5 Peveril (1875) in the main exhibition hall of the museum Housed in a former bus garage, the museum was opened in 1975 and has a number of exhibits charting the whole history of the railway; before it opened, the goods shed (which today houses the associated souvenir shop and entrance hall) had acted as locomotive shed for several years, whilst two out-of-service locomotives (Nos. 8 Fenella and 9 Douglas were stored in the original locomotive shed. The museum was originally accessed via a purpose-built porch on the adjoining Station Road, but this changed when the whole site was refurbished in 1999. Today the museum houses the railway's last locomotive, No. 16 Mannin supplied in 1926 as well as No. 6 Peveril of 1875 and two carriages as well as a number of framed displays including tickets, memorabilia and historical documentation. Rail access to the building is via the locomotive shed to the rear. The building was built to house the buses of Isle of Man Road Services, a subsidiary of the railway company. When the museum opened an alternative bus garage was built on the site of the former bay platforms. In the past the line's original locomotive No. 1 Sutherland has been housed here together with Manx Northern Railway locomotive No. 4 Caledonia and an unusual six-wheeled coach dating from 1879, which is privately owned and currently in storage elsewhere. An original four-wheeled freight van, Gr.12, was also housed here until 1998 and this has since been restored and sees limited use in annual transport festivals. Volunteers act as guides around the museum in the summer months and there is a temporary display area which houses archive photographs and historical ephemera themed around the annual events which commemorate various anniversaries: 2017 saw the 50th anniversary of the reopening of the railway and 2018 will host display items connected to the 40th anniversary of the nationalisation of the line as well as fifty years since closure of the entire network.

He led a revolt against the Franks who had annexed Moravia during the incarceration of his relative, Svatopluk I.  Early life  Slavomir, according to the Annals of Fulda, was a member of the Moravian ruling dynasty. He seems to have been a disciple of Saints Cyril and Methodius who had in 863 arrived in Moravia where they established an institution of higher education.Kirschbaum 2007, p. xxiv. It is possible that Slavomir was one of the \\"high-ranking hostages\\" whom his relative, Rastislav, the duke of Moravia, turned over to the Franks in 864, because in that year Bishop Otgar of Eichst√§tt granted an estate near the Frankish-Moravian border to a certain Slav, Sleimar, whose name may be a variant spelling of his name. It is conceivable that Louis the German, the king of East Francia, placed Slavomir- Sleimar under Bishop Otgar's supervision and granted him an estate as a prebend while he served as a pledge for Rastislav's loyalty.  Revolt against the Franks  Rastislav was arrested and handed over to the Franks by his own nephew, Svatopluk I, in 869 or 870. However, Svatopluk himself was arrested in 870 on the order of the Louis the German's son, Carloman who appointed two Frankish lords, William and Engilschalk to rule over Moravia. Believing that Svatopluk was dead, the Moravians selected Slavomir to be their ruler. Since Slavomir had already been a priest, his election likely indicates that the Moravian ruling dynasty has run out of male heirs by that time. With Slavomir in rebellion, Carloman decided to employ the common strategy of using one \\"barbarian\\" leader to wage war against another. For this purpose he released Svatopluk from prison, and sent him back to Moravia with a large Bavarian army to depose Slavomir. Once on the battlefield, however, Svatopluk bolted from the Frankish ranks, joined forces with Slavomir, and defeated the army he had just left. Therefore, Svatopluk became again the undisputed ruler of Moravia.  See also  *Great Moravia *Louis the German *Saints Cyril and Methodius *Svatopluk I  Notes   References  *Goldberg, Eric J. (2006).

Due to the frequent absence of governors Samuel Vetch and Francis Nicholson, Caulfeild often acted as governor for extended periods between 1711 and his death. Caulfeild was born to an English family in Ireland. He was the younger son of William Caulfeild, 2nd Viscount Charlemont and the daughter of the Archbishop of Armagh. He entered the military, serving in Spain during the early years of the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1710, his regiment was sent to North America, where he took part in Francis Nicholson's successful expedition against Port-Royal, the capital of French Acadia. The next year he served in Admiral Hovenden Walker's disastrous expedition to Quebec. He impressed General John Hill, the commander of the expedition's land forces, and was appointed by Hill to command the garrison at Annapolis Royal (as Port- Royal had been renamed) and serve as deputy to Governor Samuel Vetch. Caulfeild was formally commissioned as Nova Scotia's lieutenant governor in October 1712. Vetch was absent from the province between October 1711 and June 1712, during which time Caulfeild was acting governor. Nicholson was also commissioned governor in October 1712, but his commission did not arrive in North America until 1713. In October of that year Nicholson, who was in Boston performing other duties, directed Caulfeild to assume command. Nicholson was absent during most of his time as governor, only briefly visiting the province in 1714. In 1715 Nicholson was replaced as governor by Vetch, but Vetch never came to the province again. Caulfeild governed the province in Vetch's absence until his (Caulfeild's) death in early 1717. While acting as governor, Caulfeild was involved in several attempts to obtain oaths of allegiance to the British Crown from the Acadian French. He was unsuccessful in this endeavour, although he did obtain statements of neutrality from them upon the accession of King George I. Caulfeild incurred significant personal debts in maintaining the garrison at Annapolis Royal, and was highly critical of actions by Nicholson that he saw as divisive during Nicholson's brief stay in the province.

It was filmed in 1979, released in Europe in 1980 and then in the United States on April 3, 1981 through 20th Century Fox. Plot Bo Hooper (Lewis), a clown, finds himself unemployed when the circus where he works suddenly closes. He winds up living with his sister (Susan Oliver), against the wishes of her husband Robert (Roger C. Carmel). From there he goes from job to job, wreaking havoc along the way. He finally finds some stability as a postal worker, until he finds out that his boss is his girlfriend's father. The father hates all mail carriers because his daughter's ex-husband was one, so he tries to wreck Bo's life, but Bo overcomes the odds and succeeds not only at work, but at impressing the father. Cast * Jerry Lewis as Bo Hooper * Susan Oliver as Claire Trent * Roger C. Carmel as Robert Trent * Deanna Lund as Millie * Harold J. Stone as Frank Loucazi * Steve Franken as Steve Torres * Buddy Lester as Claude Reed * Leonard Stone as Ted Mitchell Production Joseph Proctor set up a production company to produce his first film, based on a Michael Janover script, which Lewis agreed to direct and star in. This was Lewis' \\"comeback\\" film, as it was his first released film since Which Way to the Front? in 1970. In between, he filmed The Day the Clown Cried, which, to date, remains unreleased. Lewis set up a studio-like complex in 23 rooms at the Palm Aire Country Club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and became a joint owner of the production and placed his salary in escrow. He received a co-screenplay credit for his work on the film. As well as Fort Lauderdale, the film was also filmed in Palm Beach, Florida. Proctor ran into financial difficulties and work on the film was suspended for about six months in 1980 after the production ran out of money, with Lewis himself declaring personal bankruptcy. Because of this, there are many notable continuity issues throughout the film. Proctor left the production and James J. McNamara came in as producer raising $1 million to complete the production. Looking back on the shoot, Lewis admitted that \\"the whole experience was a mixed bag\\". \\"I have to admit that the awful strain of the past ten years showed in every part of my work,\\" the comedian wrote in Dean and Me: A Love Story. \\"The movie didn't really hang together, and not so surprisingly, I looked terrible in it.\\" Lewis' future wife, Sandee \\"Sam\\" Pitnick, has a cameo as a disco dancer. Lewis also played the part of the 'Little Ol' Lady' dressed in drag. During the closing credits this part was credited to \\"Joseph Levitch\\", which Lewis claimed to be his birth name. The clown makeup worn by Lewis in this film was designed by him for 1954's 3 Ring Circus and later reused in 1965's The Family Jewels. Release The producers struggled to find a U.S. distributor and the film was released in West Germany on January 31, 1980. In its first 17 days, Hardly Working grossed $2.3 million in West Germany and grossed over $4 million. It grossed $625,000 in its first week in France. The Europe success and sold out test engagements in Colorado Springs and Wichita, Kansas convinced 20th Century Fox to pick up the independent production for distribution in the United States. The U.S. cut was trimmed from the European prints by around 20 minutes. The U.S. cut opens with a montage of scenes from earlier Jerry Lewis films, including The Bellboy, Cinderfella, The Errand Boy, Who's Minding the Store?, and The Patsy. The film premiered in the United States on March 27, 1981 in Palm Beach and opened in the United States on April 3, 1981 and grossed $4,160,193 in its opening weekend from 704 theatres and was number one on Variety's weekly film chart. It went on to gross $24 million in the United States. It grossed $25 million throughout Europe and South America, for a worldwide gross of $49 million. Reception The movie received negative reviews; Roger Ebert gave it zero stars and called it \\"one of the worst movies ever to achieve commercial release in this country [...] no wonder it was on the shelf for two years before it saw the light of day.\\" In his Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave it two stars out of four with this comment: \\"Not a very good movie; the opening montage [...] is much funnier than anything that follows.\\" When the movie was first shown in Miami, Florida, critics were not invited to the premiere, as Fox was afraid the word would get out how bad the film was, before the general release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 10% rating based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 2.67/10.

It is organised by Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association, the missionary wing of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church. The origin and growth of this annual get- together for one week at a stretch can be traced to the great revival movement which gathered momentum during the reformation period in the Syrian Churches of Kerala under the pioneering leadership of Abraham Malpan in the latter part of the 19th century. This brought about the transformation in resurgence of the ancient apostolic Churches in Kerala founded by St. Thomas the Apostlehttp://www.tertullian.org/fathers/apocryphal_acts_07_judas_thomas.htm approximately in AD 52. Cultural identity of Saint Thomas Christians Saint Thomas in the Syriac-speaking culture of upper Mesopotamia and Syria the apostle was called Judas Thomas. Thomas (Tau'ma) means twin in Syriac.Maelle Doliveux, \\"Newsweek\\", January 2015. Page 6-41. Jawaharlal Nehru in his Glimpses of World History, 1934 wrote about Christianity in India: \\"You may be surprised to learn that Christianity came to India long before it went to England or Western Europe, and when even in Rome it was a despised and proscribed sect. Within 100 years or so of the death of Jesus, Christian Missionaries came to South India by sea. They were received courteously and permitted to preach their new faith. They converted a large number of people, and their descendants have lived there, with varying fortune, to this day. Most of them belong to old Christian sects which have ceased to exist in Europe\\". St. Ephraem, a Christian deacon and scholar, in AD 363 composed a poem that honors St. Thomas in that era's understanding: \\"Blessed art thou, like a solar ray, India‚Äôs darkness doth dispel. Thou the great lamp, one among the Twelve, with oil from the cross replenished India‚Äôs night flooded with light. Oh Blessed Apostle, valiant Mar Thoma whom violent threats did not affright, Blessed apostle be thou praised, whom the Great King has sent that India to his one begotten thou shouldest espouse.\\" An ancient Indian non- Christian work Nagargarandhavaryola mentions St. Thomas: In AD 52 \\"the foreigner Thomas Sanyasi came to our village, preached there causing pollution. We therefore came away from that village.\\" Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association By 1877, there were two factions in the Malankara church, known as Bishop faction (Methran Kakshi) and Patriarch faction (Bava Kakshi). By a court verdict on 12 July 1889, Bishop faction lost all the properties. In this turbulent period, on 5 September 1888, 12 members of the Bishop faction formed a missionary group called \\"Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association\\".Rev.George Alexander (Ed). \\"Maramon Convention Sathapdhi Valum-'95.\\" Page 166.Mar Thoma Sabha Directory. (1999). Page 149. These 12 members are considered the founding fathers of the Maramon convention. The names of these 12 members are:- Kadavil Malika # Kottarathil Thomas Kasseessa, Chengannur # Edavamvelil Mathai, Eraviperoor. # Kottooreth Yohannan, Chengannur # Chempakasseril Kadavil Abraham, Kallissery # Chakkalayil Cherian Upadesi, Puthencavu # Chempakasseril Kadavil Mathuchen, Kallissery # Azhakinal Thommi, Kallooppara # Nathaniel Upadesi, Chengannur # Kurichiath (Vattadiyil) Ittiyavara, Niranam # Arangat Philipose, Maramon # Ottaplammoottil Kunju Mathew, Kallissery # Kochumannil Skariah, Edayaranmula They met at the Kadavil Malika belonging to Chempakasseril Kadavil Abraham and Chempakasseril Kadavil Mathuchen (1860 - 1897). This house at Kallissery near Chengannur was built by their grandfather Unnittan Kathanar (1767 - 1852) and his son Abraham Kathanar (1822 - 1884) also known as Kadavil Achen, in the early 19th century. (The Kadavil Malika was reclaimed by the Marthoma church and renovated on 10 September 2005.) Beginning By 1894, a number of small supportive prayer group communions emerged and this paved a way for revival. They had regular meetings in various parishes. Because the number of people attending these meetings was growing; the need was addressed by deciding to have a meeting of these groups in a wider level at a central accessible place. This was a venue for dimensional spiritual edification that is applicable, biblically sound, ideal and value based for striving with the realities of the world and never a place for signs, wonders and miracles. During the 19th century, people began to occupy hilly places which resulted in felling of forests in and around the catchment area of Pampa river and started intensive cultivation of annual crops like tapioca, yams ... etc. This unplanned encroachment resulted in large scale soil erosion. Deep river with mud was filled with white sand, which turned to be congenial place to assemble for a gathering of masses. No need for any seating arrangement as people can sit on the neat white sand bed under roofs made by knitted coconut leaves. The duty of organising this meeting was given to the Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association and the first convention was held in 1895 at Maramon. Today the changing habitat and lesser focus on agriculture with rise of rubber plantation, the surfaced roads minimised soil erosion and a large scale sand mining for construction activities decreased the size of the sand bed to a great extent. By 1900 reformers adopted the name Malankara Marthoma Suriyani Sabha also known as the Mar Thoma Church to encase its ancient lineage.

First Convention The first convention was held for 10 days from 8 to 17 March 1895. The venue was the vast sand-bed of the Pampa River next to the Maramon church. The parishes in and around Maramon ‚Äì Kozhencherry helped in making a very large panthal (tent) to accommodate about 10,000 people. The main speakers were David and Wordsworth. On an average 10,000 to 15,000 people attended these meetings. On the last day almost 25,000 attended. There were no proper roads during those days. So nearby houses accommodated the people from far away places. Some of them came in boats and used them as their shelter. Convention these days Maramon Convention is held for eight days during the first week of the Great Lent that usually falls in February. The tent has a seating capacity in excess of 160,000 people. They are seated on the dry sand bed. Old and weak are given sponsored-paid chairs to sit on. There is also a smaller tent erected next to the larger one for people with infants and with children below 5. All around the temporary tent there are prayer and rest sheds and other tents for various purposes related to the Church. Stalls for the sale of religious literature and other items, church mission advertisement and funding offices and restaurants are allowed to operate in the vicinity of the tent under the control of the Church authorities. Programme A view of the Convention Nagar, people returning after a session in 1994. The Maramon Convention is pre-eminently an assembly of Christians who once a year come here for listening to the Word of God as read and expounded by Christian leaders from all over India as well as abroad. Introduction and promotion of Church activities and Preaching occupy the major part of the convention programme. In the morning there will be separate Bible study classes for Men, women, youth and children conducted by specially invited leaders. The mornings and afternoons are public meetings and in the evening, meetings are for men only. Four of the afternoon public meetings are for 'Facing the challenges of Social evils as Christians'. The choir leads the singing and the introduction of voguish songs and the whole gathering joins in singing. A hymn book with 101 hymns including 16 new ones are printed every year for the convention use. Everyday half an hour is spent for intercessory prayer.Mathew 6:5 Also there are family gatherings, youth meetings and special gatherings after the afternoon session.

Besides there are special sessions and programs for focus groups in ecumenical concerns, and promotion of organic and sustainable farming zest, dalit integration activities, transgender empowerment, women and children upliftment. =Missionary responsibilities= The Church is constantly stepping up through these conventions to fulfill the missionary responsibilities and It has spread as service activities from Tibetan Border and in the northern end of Uttar Pradesh, to Kanya Kumari (Cape Comerin) in the South. Several social service and income generating institutions of the Church owe their origin to this annual get together at Maramon. Destitute homes, Ashrams, mission centres, hospitals, leprosy clinics, schools, and colleges have been started in and outside Kerala. The messages of the Maramon Convention provides a revived ideological and experiential faith in accordance to the need of the laity and period of time. Law and order Police contingent is not required in the convention premises to maintain law and order, a vigilant committee of priests and elders circle around maintaining peace. Any changes in the convention program apart from the published daily program schedule through website is alerted through mobile messaging services for those who register, and important notices about lost items, wandered away children, bus timings, etc. are also alerted through this service from 2015. Financial matter History of the financial matters is an interesting one. The panthal (tent), and the sheds are the voluntary contributions of the parishes nearby. Earlier, offerings were collected in every meeting. Now it is collected in four of the 21 general meetings and a special collection from parishes in foreign lands. The collection is distributed to various organisations and missions of the church and also for the Bible society and CSSM.Mar Thoma Sabha Directory. (1999). Page 169. Conclusion All those who come to the convention area experience peace, the spiritual liveliness that is spread around the panthal (tent) & the mobility of the masses with the sense of equality. The unbroken prayer of the laity is considered the grace behind the spiritual backbone of the convention. The Maramon Convention displays co- operation and union between different sections of Church in Kerala. It fosters an ecumenical outlook. It is also a source of spiritual inspiration and enlightenment for thousands. See also *Maramon *Marthoma Church *Kadavil Malika *Pathanamthitta References Further reading #Rev.

The D7 was first manufactured in 1938. A series of improved models were later produced, including the D7C in 1955, the D7D in 1959, the 160 hp D7E in 1961, the 180 hp D7F in 1969 and the 200 hp D7G in 1974. In 1986 the 215 hp D7H was the first D7 equipped with Caterpillar‚Äôs elevated drive sprocket undercarriage. The D7R replaced the D7H in 1996, followed by the D7R Series 2. The electric drive D7E entered service in early 2009, returning to a traditional ‚Äòflat-track‚Äô configuration for this iteration only. The high-drive design returned in 2020 with the introduction of the D7 (forgoing a generational letter under Caterpillar‚Äôs new naming system). In March 2008, at Conexpo 2008 held every 3 years in Las Vegas, Caterpillar introduced the D7E. This 235 hp D7E comes with an electric drive system powered by a 537cid C9.3 diesel engine. The C9.3 powers a generator that turns out electricity that supplies power to a pair of AC drive motors. Compared to the Caterpillar D7R Series II, the D7E was projected to deliver 25 percent more material moved per gallon of fuel, 10 percent greater productivity and 10 percent lower lifetime operating costs. The D7R Series II at 240 hp power and an operating weight of around 20 tons, is in the middle of Caterpillar's track-type tractors, which range in size from the D3 57 kW (77 hp), 7 t (8 short tons), to the D11 698 kW (935 hp), 112 t (124 short tons). It is primarily used to move material short distances or through challenging terrain. The vehicle is powerful, yet small and light (16 to 20 t (18 to 23 short tons) depending on configuration). This makes it ideal for working on very steep slopes, in forests, and for backfilling pipelines safely without risking damage to the pipe. An agricultural version without the blade and rippers is commonly used by farmers. Specially modified D7E's fitted with Rome plows were used to clear forest in the Vietnam war. The US Army used armored D7G to clear mine fields and unarmored D7G and D7H for earthworks. The armor was developed by the Israel Military Industries (IMI). Later, the US Army developed a remote controlled version of the D7G for mine-clearing applications. The United States Marine Corps replaced its fleet of D7Gs with John Deere's 850J MCT in 2009. The Egyptian Army operates an unknown number of armored D7R II. Blades The dozer blade on front of the tractor usually comes in 4 varieties: # Straight (\\"S-Blade\\") which is short and has no lateral curve, no side wings, and can be used for fine grading. # Angle: A type of blade, typically only 4' in height, that attaches to the dozers C-frame. The C-frame has 3 holes on each side where the blade will be manually pinned into, thus the angle blade has 3 set positions: right angle, left angle, and centered. Most commonly found in pipeline construction, due to the fact that an experienced operator can move and grade large quantities of material in a relatively short amount of time. # Universal (\\"U-Blade\\") which is tall and very curved, and has large side wings to carry more material. # \\"S-U\\" combination blade which is shorter, has less curvature, and smaller side wings. Various other blade types are used including landfill U-Blades, woodchip U-blades, and two-way blades for work inside the holds of ships. crane option, 1943 In popular culture A WW-II era Caterpillar D7 is the main antagonist in the novelette Killdozer! by Theodore Sturgeon.

Set in a dystopian world filled with large structures, the story revolves around creatures known as Gaunas who can shape bone-like armor and weaponry around themselves. The transformation begins around the spine and then shapes layered armor. The story focuses on one such Gauna known as Kudou Denji. The work was collected and published by Shueisha on May 19, 2006 in two volumes. It is licensed for French release by Gl√©nat, Polish by JPF and English by Viz Media. Plot Sometime in the future, humans have utterly destroyed Earth's environment and have been forced to live in cities connected only by a single highway and many tubes. However, some humans mutated and became the White Gaunas, which pose a threat to mankind. A group of scientists foresaw this dystopian situation years before. In an attempt to preserve humanity's future, they created a number of time machines each powered by nuclear plants, named as the mausoleums. Each time machine could accommodate humans and send them to a very distant future, thus ensuring the survival of the human race. They also used the collective energy from these plants to shift all the White Gaunas on Earth at that time to a separate dimension. The scientists eventually entrusted knowledge of all this to the 4th Eon Group (4th Chronicle Group), tasked to ensure at least a pair of humans can escape into the future. However, humans were mutating into new White Gaunas all over the place. These White Gaunas terrified and started to consume the remaining humans. People then began to fight over the time machines and the mausoleums in desperation. Due to all the chaos, all the mausoleums were destroyed save one. The entire 4th Eon Group was wiped out, but not before they uploaded remnants of their memories and personalities onto the computers embedded in the Raven, the Skull Man and the Stick. At this point, the Observation Bureau (Kagen House) was created to safeguard the true purpose of the Mausoleums so as to prevent further conflict. Hundreds of years later, to counter the White Gaunas, the Observation Bureau studied the White Gaunas and engineered a human-Gauna hybrid, namely the Black Gaunas. These hybrids would have the abilities of the White Gaunas yet retain their human minds. Two children, Denji and Nayuta were used as test subjects. Nayuta was the first to be experimented upon, and a control device was implanted in her. However, before they could do the same to Denji, he escaped, killing loads of people in the process.. A few years later, Tadohomi engages Denji's help in eliminating the first White Gauna before more people are killed. Denji complies but is wounded in the process. Sakijima tracks down Tadohomi and arrests her after Denji's body is found at the scene of the aftermath of the battle with the White Gauna. At this point, Sakijima is oblivious about the Observation Bureau's existence . Meanwhile, the Observation Bureau sends Nayuta as a Black Gauna to bring Denji back to HQ by taking advantage of Denji's wounded state. The boss of the Observation Bureau feels that Black Gaunas are untrustworthy; to him, Black Gaunas are monsters akin to their White cousins. Sakijima is ordered by his bosses in the Ministry to release Tadohomi. At this point he starts becoming suspicious of the Observation Bureau and decides to dig up the truth. Another White Gauna spawns, but this time it is able to consume many humans before the Bureau took action. At first, they simply sent a squad of humans, but when this was wiped out, they sent Nayuta to destroy the big White Gauna. Unfortunately, a disturbingly humanoid White Gauna appears and duels with Nayuta. After an epic battle, Nayuta wins a Pyrrhic victory - a few seconds after fatally stabbing the White Gauna, Nayuta falls dead. Because she is telepathically linked with her twin Ayuta, any damage sustained by Nayuta is also manifested in Ayuta. Meanwhile, the cop Sakijima gains info regarding the 4th Chronicle Group and the Gaunas from a colleague who was sent to chat with an old man in charge of the archives. With this info in hand, Sakijima moves to Kegen Hall for a confrontation. His colleague gets shot down by a Kegen Hall security guard whom Sakijima then kills in anger. Sakijima meets Tadohomi who is trying to rescue her childhood friend Denji just as she is about to get killed by a team of Kegen Hall guys. Sakijima helps her out and they both enter the room where Denji is being held. At this point, a revived Ayuta suddenly awakes and mutates into a White Gauna. Denji fights Ayuta head on while Sakijima and Tadohomi escape on a helicopter. The successors to the 4th Chronicle Group's memories seek to activate a powerful missile weapon they believe is capable of killing the Big White Gauna if it hits the spinal cord. Ayuta, now a White Gauna, attacks them and Denji fights her off, buying the Raven and the Skull Man some time. When the missile was primed and the Big White Gauna in sight, the skull man was still hanging onto the missile, trying to attack the hostless black Gauna with the projectile, so the Raven had no choice but to fire the missile along with him in hope of taking the Big White Gauna down. The missile hits and the Big White Gauna falls, but the nuclear reactor was already beginning to fail and the Forbidden Cage appeared because there was insufficient energy to dimensionally shift all those White Gaunas anymore. A White Gauna attacks the helicopter, which consequently crashes. The Stick and the Raven guide Tadohomi and Sakijima to the House storing the time machine. The Raven gets killed by Ayuta but Nayuta, a Black Gauna, appears in the nick of time and kills her sister. Tadohomi and Sakijima escape into the House just as an explosion seemingly destroys Nayuta. With the help of the Stick, the duo activate the time machine Many years laters, it is shown that the rest of humanity has been obliterated either by the White Gaunas or by infighting. The world is an empty landscape and lush greenery has taken over the House's rooms. Tadohomi and Sakijima run out of the House and look up into the dark, empty sky. And two Black Gaunas, revealed to be Denji and Nayuta, still is battling the White Gaunas, stranded in a separate dimension. (This is conveyed through the double spread pages, separate from the pages with Sakijima and Tadohomi in their original dimension). PS: Digimortal has no relation to the story of Abara.

It was bound with nine green lengths of ash bands or 'beams', preferably all from the same tree. At the appropriate moment during Christmas Eve, the faggot must be burnt in a hearth while people who are watching sing Dunster Carols.Ashen Faggot Retrieved 26 June 2013 Historical significance Ash was probably chosen for this ritual because the ash tree has a long pedigree of magical associations: perhaps the most important is the Yggdrasil of Norse mythology, also known as the World Ash Tree. The ‚ÄúChristianized‚Äù version of the use of ash was when Mary used wood to light a fire in order to wash infant Jesus. In Romanian culture, it was thought that Jesus was born in a field and that he was kept warm by the head of an ash. Christmas Eve ritual The wassail party Ashen Faggot Wassail at Mainly Norfolk Retrieved 26 June 2013 passes around a bundle of ash sticks, twigs or branches--the remnant of the previous year's faggot--bound with green ash withies, which is then placed onto the fire. It is done traditionally by the oldest person in the room. The heat created is a comfort in midwinter nights. As each binding bursts, the watchers toast it with a drink. Some traditions Burning the Ashen Faggot Retrieved 26 June 2013 had the unmarried women each choosing a withy, and the first one whose tie snapped would be married the next year. When the bindings have all burst and the bundle has fallen loose, each person who plans to host the festivities next year takes one of the half-burned ash sticks and saves it until the following Christmas, when it will go in the centre of their own ashen faggot. This tradition symbolizes continuity of life and endures (or has been resurrected) in many places; the Winter 2005 issue of Devon Talk claims that the Harbour Inn in Axmouth annually builds an ashen faggot six feet high and three feet wide for their huge fireplace. This tradition survives in pubs on the border between Devon and Somerset (The Squirrel Inn in Laymore being one of these) and is celebrated on the evening of the 6th of January each year (old Christmas Eve). Here the ritual centres on an ashen faggot around twelve feet in length bound by approximately a dozen withies. At the beginning of the evening, the butt of the faggot is placed against the rear of the fireplace, where a fire is already ablaze. Bets are then placed on the length of time (which is usually several hours) until the last binding bursts, with the closest estimate winning a prize and the proceeds going to charity. It was believed that any household that did not burn the ashen faggot would face years of bad luck and misfortune.The traditional Christmas Ashen Faggot Retrieved 26 June 2013 Some versions suggest that an ashen faggot kept in the house would keep away the Devil and evil spirits. In popular media Shirley Collins's song the \\"Ashen Faggot Wassail\\", on her 1974 Topic album Adieu to Old England, is a celebration of the tradition.

For sale in a Japanese supermarket, 2014 Brasenia is a perennial aquatic plant with floating, peltate leaves and rhizomatous stems. It is identified by its bright green leaves, small purple flowers that bloom from June through September, and a thick mucilage that covers all of the underwater organs, including the underside of the leaves, stems, and developing buds. This mucilage may be an anti-herbivore defence trait,Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. Figure 6.9 perhaps to deter snail grazing. It grows in shallow water of lakes, rivers and beaver ponds, particularly those with somewhat acidic water.  Characteristics  Ponds along Attikamek Trail at Sault Ste. Marie Canal Brasenia exhibits wind pollination. The flowers have a two-day blooming period. On the first day, the functionally female, or pistillate flower, extends above the surface of the water and exposes the receptive stigmas. The flower then recedes below the water surface and on the following day emerges as a functionally male, or staminate flower. It is elevated higher than on the previous day and the anther-bearing filaments are extended beyond the female carpels.Taylor,Mackenzie L. and Jeffrey M. Osborn. 2006. Pollen ontogeny in Brasenia (Cabombaceae, Nymphaeales). American Journal of Botany 93: 344-356 The anthers dehisce, releasing the pollen, and the flower is then withdrawn below the water where the fruit develops.  Uses  Brasenia is cultivated as a vegetable in China (where it is known as , Pinyin: ) and where it is used in Hangzhou in the well-known local speciality \\"West Lake Water Shield Soup () and in Japan (where it is known as junsai). The mucilage it produces has been found to have anti-algal and anti-bacterial properties that may be useful as a natural weed control .

The perianth of Cabomba is either trimerous (having members in each whorl in groups of three) or bimerous (in groups of two) with white, oval-shaped petals, and is usually about 2.0 cm across when fully developed. The petals are unlike the sepals in that the former have two yellow ear-shaped nectaries at the base. Petals may also have purplish edges. Flowers are protogynous, having primarily female sexual structures on the first day of appearance and then switching to male on the second and subsequent days. Flowers emerge and are designed to be pollinated above the waterline. Principal pollinators are flies and other small flying insects. References * √òrgaard, M. (1991).

History The nurses' home The establishment was designed by John Rawsthorne and opened as the Sheffield General Infirmary in 1792. The first three surgeons to work at the hospital were Mr. Cheney, Mr. C.H Webb and Mr. William Staniforth. A new south-east wing designed by John Dodsley Webster was completed in 1884. The new wing accommodated an octagonal outpatients department which was lit by a cupola. It had a roof of wrought iron lattice girders and a tiled waiting room with the consulting rooms leading off it. A nurses' home, also designed by John Dodsley Webster and named \\"Centenary House\\", was completed in 1897, the year in which the hospital was renamed The Royal Infirmary, Sheffield. The infirmary joined the National Health Service in 1948 and, after services had transferred to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, it closed in 1980. Some of the buildings were subsequently demolished, but the original block along with its south-east and south-west wings, which remains a Grade II* listed building, was renamed Heritage House and converted into offices.

It lives in calm, often silty or sandy waters in streams, small to large rivers, and lakes. A bottom-feeder, it feeds on microcrustaceans, aquatic insects, detritus, algae, and small mollusks. The golden redhorse spawns in the spring. Geographic distribution The golden redhorse can be found in freshwater habitats across 25 different states in the eastern half of North America. There are populations located in the drainage basins of the Mississippi River, Ohio River, and the lower Missouri River. The fish can also be found in the Great Lakes, excluding Lake Superior, and the Lakes‚Äô basin, as well as in the Lake of the Woods. The Mobile Bay drainage basin in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and southeastern Tennessee also contains the golden redhorse. In Mississippi there is an isolated population in the southwestern part of the state. Some suspect that it is a relict population, meaning the range of the fish was once much larger than it is today. They were introduced into the Potomac River in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, but the date of this introduction is unknown. A golden redhorse was seen in this river in 1953, but was never seen there again until 1971. In Canada, the golden redhorse is endemic to Manitoba and Ontario. The fish can be found in the Red River of the North, a river which eventually empties into Hudson Bay. Coincidentally, the Red River in Texas also houses the golden redhorse. Physical characteristics Golden redhorses average around 12-18 inches long and weigh between 1-2 pounds, although some can reach up to 26 inches and 4-5 pounds. The golden scales decorating its sides gave the fish its name. They have olive colored backs, white bellies, and slate gray tail fins. Their body is fusiform in shape, allowing them to fight against currents in streams to capture their prey. The mouth of the fish is in the inferior position. The dorsal fin is slightly concave and the caudal fin is notched. It has a single anal fin and paired pelvic and pectoral fins. The pelvic fins are in the abdominal position, while the pectoral fins are located in more of a thoracic position. It has a lateral line system consisting of 39 to 42 scales which is used to detect movement and vibrations in the surrounding water. Habitat Golden redhorses can be found in freshwater streams, creeks, and rivers with varied substrates. In pools they are generally found over sand and silt. Occasionally they have been seen living in lakes or larger reservoirs that are fed by a stream or river. Compared to other redhorse species the golden redhorse is not very sensitive to poor environmental conditions. Diet The diet of the golden redhorse consists of a variety of small, aquatic creatures. They consume larval insects, small mollusks, microcrustaceans, and other aquatic invertebrates. Like most other members of the sucker family, Catostomidae, detritus and algae are also staples of the golden redhorse's diet. It is a bottom-feeding species that is able to use its protrusible mouth to suck up food objects from the stream bed. Reproduction and life cycle The golden redhorse lives for 8‚Äì11 years and becomes sexually mature at age 3-5. They spawn in the spring once water temperatures are between 17-22 ¬∞C. When this occurs depends on the geographic location, but spawning usually happens at night during April or May. Spawning most often occurs in a runs or riffles within the main stream, but some individuals may move into smaller, more well protected tributaries. The spawning streams are gravel bottomed, as their benthic, bottom-dwelling young prefer to hide beneath the stones after they hatch from their adhesive eggs. Golden redhorses provide no parental care to their offspring. The young often form large schools and feed together along the stream bottom. Some schools may include a mixture of different redhorse species. Relationship with humans The golden redhorse is a game fish, but it is a species not often pursued by anglers. It is often caught by accident when anglers fish on the bottom for catfish. Fishing for members of the sucker family usually occurs in the early spring when the water temperature reaches 42 ¬∞F. Fishing several inches off the stream bottom with simple worms as bait is a good method to catch suckers. Gigging for suckers is another common practice. This is done using a multi- headed spear at night, often with a mounted light on the bow of the boat. The golden redhorse can be cooked smoked or pickled. The IGFA record for the species stands at 4lb 1oz caught from French Creek in Franklin, Pennsylvania in 1997.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 30 in the town of Gilboa to a junction with County Route 18 (CR 18) in the town of Conesville, where the road continues east as CR 3\\\\. Reference routes in New York are typically unsigned; however, NY 990V is fully signed with touring route markers. The road is a remnant of New York State Route 342, a route assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The NY 342 designation was removed in the late 1940s; however, its former routing from Gilboa to Conesville remained a state highway and became NY 990V when the modern reference route system in New York was created. Route description Approaching the western terminus of NY 990V at NY 30 in Gilboa NY 990V begins northwest of the Schoharie Reservoir at an intersection with NY 30 in the town of Gilboa. The route heads northeast around the reservoir as a two-lane highway, intersecting CR 13 (Stryker Road) in an area of open fields before crossing Schoharie Creek a short distance downstream from the Gilboa Dam. On the opposite bank of the creek, the highway quickly passes through the small hamlet of Gilboa, located at a junction with CR 17 (Flat Creek Road). Outside of Gilboa, NY 990V turns to the southeast, paralleling the eastern edge of the reservoir as it runs through a stretch of forests and passes directly south of Gilboa-Conesville Central School. The wooded areas give way to slightly more open terrain in the adjacent town of Conesville, where the route meets CR 39 (Prattsville Road) just east of the town line. CR 39 heads south from this point, taking over as the primary waterside roadway while NY 990V heads east into a valley surrounding Manor Kill. Not far from CR 39, the route enters the hamlet of West Conesville, another small community built up around NY 990V's junction with CR 59 (Bull Hill Road). The road continues northeastward from West Conesville, serving a handful of scattered homes separated by stretches of woodland and open fields. This sparsely developed section along the northern bank of Manor Kill ultimately leads to the hamlet of Conesville, located at an intersection with CR 18 (Bear Kill Road). NY 990V ends at the junction, and its right-of-way continues east toward NY 145 in Durham as CR 3 (Potter Mountain Road). Reference routes in New York are typically not signed with touring route markers, as most are short connector roads or are known by other, more prominent names. NY 990V, however, is fully signed as a touring route. History Crossing Schoharie Creek on NY 990V westbound Modern NY 990V was gradually taken over by the state of New York over the course of the early 20th century. The portion east of Schoharie Creek became state-maintained on August 28, 1917, following a $46,774 project (equivalent to $ in ) to improve the existing road to state highway standards. The rest of the highway was added as a state road in the late 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the Gilboa‚ÄìConesville state highway was designated as part of NY 342, a new route extending from NY 30 west of the hamlet of Gilboa to the Conesville hamlet of Manorkill. By the following year, NY 342 was truncated westward to the hamlet of Conesville while a highway between NY 23 near South Gilboa and NY 30 southwest of Gilboa was designated as NY 297. The NY 297 designation was short-lived as it was removed . NY 342 was extended westward over the former routing of NY 297 in the mid-1940s; however, the designation was eliminated in the late 1940s. While the portion west of NY 30 became CR 14, the section east of NY 30 was retained as a state highway. When the modern reference route system was created, the Gilboa‚ÄìConesville state highway was designated as NY 990V.

The company was formed in Hong Kong in 1923, when businessman Lee Hysan acquired plots of land in East Point, now known as Causeway Bay, Hong Kong Island. On 30 April 1928, Hysan, who was aged 48‚Äì49, was killed. His descendant expanded the plots of land into a business empire. Today, Hysan is said to be the largest commercial landlord in the Causeway Bay area. History =Predecessor= The predecessor of the company began when Lee Hysan incorporated Lee Hysan Estate Co., Ltd. (), acquiring the land lease (crown lease) on Jardine's Hill, Hong Kong Island, in 1923 and other land leases around nearby East Point; which is now known as Causeway Bay. Before his death in 1928, Lee had distributed the most of the shares of Lee Hysan Estate to his wife, concubines, children and relatives in 1925. The shares he retained, 1/5 of the share capital, was inherited by his wife. East Point in colonial times contained mostly residential areas, with some offices dedicated to a British trading company. The development of the Jardine's Hill property into an entertainment ground‚Äîthe modern day Lee Garden‚Äîand the following construction of the Lee Theatre as a Chinese opera venue set the trend for the continual redevelopment of Causeway Bay. =Hysan Development= Hysan Development was incorporated on 20 October 1970 as Hennessy Development Company Limited (unofficial translation appeared in Chinese media as or ) It was said to acquire a land lease (leasehold of Crown land) from the parent company Lee Hysan Estate in 1971 to re-develop into () in Hennessy Road (), which was demolished in 2010s for another re-development. In 1973, the company became an unlisted public limited company, selling 25% of its shares to the general public. was a minority shareholder of Hysan Development. The company was listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong () in September 1981. The Chinese-language media also reported another unofficial translation of the company name Hysan Development, as . It was said the company acquired three more sister companies from its parent company; these were Leighton (), Sunning () and Avenue respectively in the 1970s. The company also owned a subsidiary called \\"Kwong Wan\\". Hysan Development and the four subsidiaries owned five building complexes at that time, namely Hennessy Centre, Leighton Centre, One Hysan Avenue, Sunning Court and Sunning Plaza. After it became a listed company, Hysan Development acquired more land leases from the family members of Lee Hysan and from the family-owned company Lee Hysan Estate in 1980s to 1990s for re-development. These included a land lease on 74‚Äì86 Kennedy Road, now known as Bamboo Grove and the re-development of Lee Theatre and Lee Gardens Hotel into Lee Theatre Plaza and Lee Garden One respectively. It was reported that 74‚Äì86 Kennedy Road was the former location of the Lee family mansion, for which a building plan for another potential re-development was approved in 2017. The company also acquired some properties in and re- developed it into Lee Garden Two (called Caroline Centre at that time) in the early 1990s. In 1987, the company agreed to acquire 5% shares of the soon-to- be-listed HKR International. At the same time, the company issued 393.7 million new shares for HK$1.25 each, equal to 10% of the total share capital, to the Lee family. The Lee family sold the same number of shares to third parties. The event occurred right before the Black Monday crash in the same year. In 1988, a scandal regarding the listing of those new shares of Hysan and other listed companies not connected to Hysan was exposed. It was alleged that a securities brokerage firm had bribed Ronald Li, chairman of the exchange, as an incentive for approval. Both the Lee and Li families were considered two of the four big families of the colonial era, which were the social elites that formed a network of collaboration. In 1991, Hysan Development announced they were negotiating to sell their residential portfolio Garden Terrace in the Mid-Levels. At the same time, they also developed Tanner Garden in North Point as a for-sale portfolio, as well as owning 5% shares of Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways as an investment. According to another columnist, Hysan Development owned 30% stake in the Tanner Garden project. Hysan Place was one of Hysan Developments' re- development projects of the 2010s; the site was formerly known as Hennessy Centre. It was opened in 2012 and comprises 15 levels of office space and 17 floors of retail outlets, totalling . Hysan Place achieved pre-certification at the Platinum level for the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (USGBC LEED), and the Hong Kong Building Environmental Assessment Method (HK BEAM) standard. Another re- development, Lee Garden Three, was completed in 2017. The re-development also caused a minor controversy; Sunning Plaza, which was set to be demolished in 2013 to make way for Lee Garden Three, was designed by architect I. M. Pei and was considered an oasis in the business district by some citizens. It was only used for 31 years. In 2016, Hysan partnered with HKR International to form a joint venture called Strongbod Limited, which won a tender to buy two neighbouring residential land leases in Tai Po from the government. Share listing Hysan Development shares are listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Its shares are also traded through over-the-counter facilities in London. In addition, Hysan Development has a sponsored listing of their American Depositary Receipts (ADR) in the OTC Markets Group. Portfolio ,Hysan Development's principal portfolio consists of a 10 building complexes. Except Lee Garden Two, which Hysan owned 65.36%, they are wholly owned by the company as leasing floor area: # Lee Garden One (commercial) (also known as Manulife Plaza) # Bamboo Grove (residential) # Lee Garden Two (commercial) (also known as Caroline Centre) # (commercial) # Lee Theatre Plaza (commercial) # (commercial) # (commercial) # Lee Garden Five (commercial) (also known as 18 Hysan Avenue) # Lee Garden Six (commercial) (also known as 111 Leighton Road) # Hysan Place (commercial) (located on 500 Hennessy Road. Hysan Place opened in 2012 and was the site of Hennessy Centre and Mitsukoshi department store Six of the complexes were partially or entirely on a land- lease call Inland Lot No.29, despite being broken into several sub-leases. According to other companies, Inland Lot No.29, a former crown lease, was commenced from 25 June 1860 in a term of 982 years‚Äî999 years from 1842, the establishment of the colony.http://www.cfbgroup.com.hk/sites/default/files/announcement_circular%20/GLN20140828051.pdfhttp://www.dch.com.hk/english/investor/prospectus/files/multi- files/E131.pdf According to a columnist, if those 999-year land leases were not revised, they had a very low government rent payable to the government in the modern-day standard. Hysan Developments is known for suing the Hong Kong government in civil court. Despite the height of the building structure above sea level, which was not restricted by the terms in the land lease but by plot ratio, the Town Planning Board introduced new height restrictions in their draft Outline Zoning Plans (OZPs) of the Wan Chai and Causeway Bay areas, causing a potential decrease in re-development values of the area. This policy was officially mentioned in 2009‚Äì10 Policy Agenda of the government as \\"beautifying the coasts of the Victoria Harbour\\" and \\"continuing to stipulate in all outline zoning plans clear development restrictions on plot ratio/gross floor area, site coverage and/or building height where justified to improve the living environment\\" respectively. Public consultations on height restriction was started in 2000. Those policies were interpreted as the continuation of the policy to protect the ridge line of Hong Kong Island from high-rise buildings. Hysan sued the government, quoting clause in the Hong Kong Basic Law on protecting private property rights as rationale, and after losing the case in the High Court, the company appealed the result at the Court of Final Appeal, which referred the case back to the Town Planning Board in 2016. Eventually, the draft OZP was revised again, announced in January 2018, approved in September 2018; the media concluded the revisions would benefit Hysan and other developers that own properties in that area. The former Hysan properties Sunning Plaza () and Sunning Court were demolished for Lee Garden Three. The site in Tai Po was under construction. Shareholders Hysan Development was incorporated in 1970,Data in Hong Kong Companies Registry while its predecessor and the largest direct shareholder, Hysan Estates Limited‚Äîformerly known as Lee Hysan Estate Company Limited‚Äîwas incorporated in 1923. As of December 2017, Hysan Estates was entirely owned by Lee Hysan Company Limited. According to company filing and activist David Webb, the latter was a Jersey-incorporated company. Lee Hysan Company Limited is believed to be controlled by members of . Despite being a family business, as of 1981, the company also had non-Lee directors such as Kwok Tak-seng of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Geoffrey Yeh of Hsin Chong, Chan Pun of Tai Cheung Holdings and Hu Fa-kuang on the board. One of the sons of Lee Hysan and one of the director of Lee Hysan Estate, , died in 1980. Former chief secretary of the colonial Hong Kong government David Akers-Jones also served as an independent director of the company after he left the government in late 1980s. Akers-Jones later became an independent non-executive chairman of Hysan until he was replaced by Irene Lee in 2011. As of December 2017, out of nine directors of the board, four were independent non-executive directors, for example Lawrence Lau. While members of Lee family took four of the remaining seats, the last seat was occupied by Hans Michael Jebsen, who is also a business partner of the company in , which is incorporated as Barrowgate Limited, as a minority shareholder. Three of the four directors from Lee families were also the directors of Hysan Estates and Lee Hysan Co. Ltd. The executive chairman Irene Lee, who is not a director of the parent companies, is the sister of Anthony Lee, another director. They also served as non- executive directors on other companies in which the Lee family and Hysan Development had invested, such as Cathay Pacific Airways (Irene Lee as independent director) and TVB (Anthony Lee). While Lee Chien had served as a director of Swire Pacific, Swire Pacific and Cathay Pacific Airways were part of the Hong Kong real estate conglomerate Swire Group.

For several months they used a succession of interim drummers, with McLennan on bass guitar and Forster on lead guitar and lead vocals.Grant McLennan at the Australian Rock Database: * Grant McLennan: * The Go-Betweens (1977‚Äì89, 2000‚Äìpresent): * Tuff Monks (1982): * Jack Frost (1990‚Äì91, 1995): * Far Out Corporation (1998): The group released their first single in September 1978, \\"Lee Remick\\", which was written by Forster.McFarlane 'The Go-Betweens' entry. Archived from the original on 29 August 2004. Retrieved 13 September 2015. During the group's initial period Forster provided most of the song writing and lead vocals. In November 1979 the Go-Betweens' McLennan and Forster travelled to England and then to Scotland, where they recorded new material, including their third single, \\"I Need Two Heads\\" (June 1980). Note: [online] version has limited functionality. By the time it appeared they had returned to Australia. As McLennan's own distinctive compositional style developed, the two shared lead vocal duties almost equally. For Go-Betweens releases from about 1980 forward, some songs were credited to \\"Forster/McLennan\\", although the two generally wrote separately, each singing their own compositions. In November 1981 the Go-Betweens issued their debut album, Send Me a Lullaby, with Lindy Morrison as their permanent drummer. Aside from lead vocals and bass guitar McLennan also provides lead guitar for three of its eight tracks ‚Äì he wrote four tracks and co-wrote one with Forster. McLennan told Gavin Sawford of Rave magazine, in April 1996, that \\"[it] is to me an inauspicious debut... if I'd heard that and I wasn't in the band, I think my comment would have been 'What the fuck is going on here.' There's great melodies but then there's changes which to this day I can't work out. There's lyrics to this day which I don't understand and when I actually summon up enough courage to get to the microphone, I sound like a choirboy with a mouthful of fruitcake.\\" In 1982 they relocated to London and recorded new material, also during that year McLennan was part of a side project, Tuff Monks, with Forster and Morrison joined by label mates, Nick Cave, Mick Harvey and Rowland S. Howard of the Birthday Party. The group released only a single, \\"After the Fireworks\\", on Missing Link Records. In late 1983 the Go-Betweens added Robert Vickers on bass guitar ‚Äì which allowed McLennan to shift to lead guitar. Late in 1986 Amanda Brown joined on oboe, violin, guitar, keyboards and backing vocals. McLennan and Brown were soon in a romantic relationship. Many of McLennan's new lyrics were about this relationship. John Willsteed replaced Vickers on bass guitar in November 1987. After recording six albums the Go-Betweens disbanded in December 1989. McLennan and Forster had made tentative plans to form an acoustic duo together. When McLennan told Brown, she ended their relationship. McLennan and Forster each pursued solo careers while Brown and Morrison formed Cleopatra Wong in 1991. McLennan and Forster reformed The Go- Betweens in 2000, and recorded three more studio albums. Their last one, Oceans Apart (October 2005), won the band their first ARIA Award: for Best Adult Contemporary Album at the 2005 ceremony. Their live album, That Striped Sunlight Sound (2006), was nominated for Best Music DVD at the 2006 awards.  Solo and collaborations  In 1990 Grant McLennan on lead vocals, bass guitar, lead guitar and keyboards formed a rock band, Jack Frost, in Sydney with the Church's front man, Steve Kilbey on lead vocals, bass guitar, lead guitar, keyboards and drums.McFarlane 'The Church' entry. Archived from the original on 4 June 2004. Retrieved 13 September 2015. The group released a self-titled album in 1991 and the pair resumed the collaboration in 1995 for a second album, Snow Job. Also in 1990 McLennan produced the debut single, \\"On and On\\", for Sydney-based duo, Club Hoy.McFarlane 'G. W. McLennan' entry. Archived from the original on 11 July 2002. Retrieved 13 September 2015. He released his debut solo album, Watershed, under the name G. W. McLennan in 1991, which was produced by Dave Dobbyn (DD Smash) on Mushroom Records' White Records label. For its United Kingdom version it appeared on Beggars Banquet. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it was an \\"ambitious and highly personalised collection of songs charted McLennan's emotions in the wake of The Go- Betweens' break-up... [it] revealed McLennan to be, in turns, the introspective singer/songwriter or the carefree and gregarious performer.\\" AllMusic's Norm Elrod noticed that McLennan \\"isn't the most talented singer; his voice is a bit plain, and his range somewhat limited. He isn't the most gifted guitarist; his playing sometimes amounts to basic acoustic strums. He is, however, a truly exceptional artist who, in the spirit of Lloyd Cole, crafts moments of brilliance to fit his limitations.\\" In November 1992 McLennan issued his second album, Fireboy, which was produced by Dobbyn again. McFarlane compared it with his previous one and found it was \\"an even more melancholy set of songs that boasted fuller (though never obtrusive) arrangements.\\" Ned Raggett of AllMusic felt it \\"finds the musician in excellent form, with a baker's dozen worth of songs that won't challenge preconceptions, but do make for a great listen all around\\" with \\"sweetly sparkling, sometimes barbed, numbers.\\" Robert Christgau, an American journalist, preferred the tracks \\"The Dark Side of Town\\", \\"Riddle in the Rain\\" and \\"Whose Side Are You On?\\", which were \\"living tunes in studio-rock amber.\\" During 1993 he toured Australia with a backing band comprising Michael Barclay on drums, Pedro Bull on keyboards (both ex-ex-Paul Kelly and the Messengers), Maurice Frawley on guitar (ex-Paul Kelly and the Dots) and Phil Kakulas on bass guitar (ex-Blackeyed Susans). McLennan's third album, Horsebreaker Star, appeared in December 1994 as a double-CD. It was recorded in Athens, Georgia with American session musicians and was produced by John Keane (R.E.M., Indigo Girls, Vic Chesnutt). Christgau found it was McLennan's \\"most consistently catchy solo album\\" providing \\"30 snapshots of a resigned romantic\\" while \\"unrolling tune after sweet, simple-seeming tune.\\" McFarlane praised \\"its wide-screen outlook, the album shifted from country rock to bright acoustic pop with a great deal of optimism and passion.\\" Raggett opined that it was \\"more of a country/Southern rock bent...his ear for focused, sharp lyrical portraits of life and love, paired with his ever-striking crisp singing style, continues to lead the way.\\" On 23 September 1997 McLennan released his fourth solo album, In Your Bright Ray, with Wayne Connolly producing (You Am I, Bluebottle Kiss, Underground Lovers). AllMusic's Jack Rabid found it \\"returns him to his more well-trodden ground... [and] is as warm and soft as a cake out of the oven, a just-washed blanket, and an Eskimo coat.\\" In 1998 he collaborated with Powderfinger's Ian Haug on guitar in Far Out Corporation. They were joined by Ross McLennan (ex-Turtlebox, no relation) on drums and Adele Pickvance on bass guitar. McFarlane described them as a \\"conceptual art group with a pop orientation.\\" They issued their sole album, FOC in October 1998, which was co-produced by Tim Whitten with the group. Death Grant William McLennan died at his Brisbane home on 6 May 2006, aged 48, from a heart attack. He was preparing for a party to celebrate with his fianc√©e, Emma Pursey; he complained of feeling unwell, and went upstairs to rest. He was found dead soon after by Pursey, his flatmate and friends. Over 1,000 people attended his funeral, including musicians Dave Dobbyn, Bernard Fanning, Ian Haug, Lindy Morrison, Dave McCormack, Steve Kilbey, Paul Kelly and Ed Kuepper. Following McLennan's death, the Queensland Government established the Grant McLennan Fellowship in 2007. The award was established to honour emerging songwriters from McLennan's home state of Queensland.

Catherine Cranston (27 May 1849 ‚Äì 18 April 1934), widely known as Kate Cranston or Miss Cranston, was a leading figure in the development of tea rooms. She is nowadays chiefly remembered as a major patron of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Margaret MacDonald, in Glasgow, Scotland. The name of Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms lives on in reminiscences of Glasgow in its heyday. Background Her father, George Cranston, was a baker and pastry maker and, in 1849, the year of her birth, he became proprietor of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Chop House and Commercial Lodgings at No. 39 George Square in Glasgow city centre. The hotel was renamed the Royal Horse, then renamed again in May 1852 to become Cranston's Hotel and Dining Rooms, offering: :\\"Convenient Coffee room and detached Smoking Rooms on Ground Floor, commodious Commercial Room and Parlour, comfortable Bed-rooms and Baths, &c.; Coffee always ready. Cigars, wines, spirits, ales, Newspapers, Time-Tables, Writing Materials. Superior and varied Bill of Fare at the usual moderate charges. Her slightly older brother Stuart (1848‚Äì1921) became a tea dealer and, according to Glasgow in 1901, was \\"a pioneer of the business\\" there of \\"tea shops pure and simple\\" who by 1901 had three such tearooms offering nothing more substantial to eat than a sandwich. Kate went on to create much more of a social facility. Like other cities in the United Kingdom, Glasgow was then a centre of the temperance movement which sought an alternative to male-centred pubs. Tea had previously been a luxury for the rich, but from the 1830s it was promoted as an alternative to alcoholic drinks, and many new caf√©s and coffee houses were opened, catering more for ordinary people. However it was not until the 1880s that tea rooms and tea shops became popular and fashionable. Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms Poster design by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. In 1878 Miss Kate Cranston opened her first tearoom, the Crown Luncheon Room, on Argyle Street, Glasgow. She set high standards of service, food quality and cleanliness, and her innovation lay in seeing the social need for something more than a restaurant or a simple \\"tea shop\\", and in putting equal attention into providing amenities designed in the latest style. Her first tearoom was decorated in a contemporary baronial style. On 16 September 1886 she opened her Ingram Street tearoom and in 1888 commissioned George Walton to decorate a new smoking room in the Arts and Crafts style in one of her tea rooms. In 1892 she became happily married to John Cochrane, but continued to trade under the name of Miss Cranston's Tearooms. She opened new tearooms in Buchanan Street in 1897 (designed by George Washington Browne), expanded to take over the whole building in Argyle Street by 1898 (designed by H and D Barclay), then completed her chain of four establishments with the Willow Tearooms (by Charles Rennie Mackintosh) in Sauchiehall Street, opened in 1903. While other cities offered very expensive and very basic tea rooms by 1901, Kate Cranston set the standard in Glasgow for more welcoming establishments. Rooms were provided for ladies only and for gentlemen only, as well as luncheon rooms where they could dine together and smoking rooms and billiards rooms for the gentlemen. Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms became social centres for all, for business men and apprentices, for ladies and ladies' maids. The Ladies Rooms were a particular success, newly allowing respectable women to get out and meet together without male company. Unlike cafes or tearooms in other cities, there was no intrusive supervision and those having tea had an assortment of Scones and cakes to hand, with a discreet notice reminding newcomers to remember the amount consumed. At \\"the accounting\\", Glasgow in 1901 reported, \\"One states the amount of ones indebtedness, and receives a check therefor from the attendant maiden. This, with the corresponding coin or coins, one hands in at the pay-desk, and so home. Nothing could be simpler or less irritating.\\" The city was a centre of artistic innovation at the time, and the tearooms served as art galleries for paintings by the \\"Glasgow Boys\\". The architect Sir Edwin Lutyens visited the Buchanan Street tearoom in 1898, finding it \\"just a little outr√©\\", and wrote from there to his wife that \\"Miss Cranston is now Mrs. Cochrane, a dark, fat wee body with black sparkling luminous eyes, wears a bonnet garnished with roses, and has made a fortune by supplying cheap clean goods in surroundings prompted by the New Art Glasgow School.\\" Tea rooms opened around the city, and in the late 1880s fine hotels elsewhere in Britain and in America began to offer tea service in tea rooms and tea courts. Glasgow in 1901 reported that \\"Glasgow, in truth, is a very Tokio for tea-rooms. Nowhere can one have so much for so little, and nowhere are such places more popular and frequented.\\" and that \\"It is not the accent of the people, nor the painted houses, nor yet the absence of Highland policemen that makes the Glasgow man in London feel that he is in a foreign town and far from home. It is a simpler matter. It is the lack of tea-shops.\\" The original Sauchiehall Street tearoom building is presently being restored and is scheduled for reopening in 2018. It is planned to develop the adjacent building as a Mackintosh visitor centre. The 'Willow Tearooms' brand has been separated from the building and is now run privately at a location within a department store further along the street and at Buchanan Street adjacent to Miss Cranston's original premises. Both locations feature recreated Mackintosh furniture and interior features. =Walton and Mackintosh= Mackintosh's design for the frieze at the Buchanan Street tearoom. George Walton set up George Walton & Co, Ecclesiastical and House Decorators on the basis of his 1888 commission from Kate Cranston, and in 1896 was commissioned by her to design the interiors of new tearooms, designed and built by George Washington Browne of Edinburgh, at 91‚Äì93 Buchanan Street, which opened the following year. He was assisted in this by Charles Rennie Mackintosh who designed wall murals in the form of stencilled friezes depicting opposing pairs of elongated female figures surrounded by roses for the ladies' tearoom, the luncheon room and the smokers' gallery. :\\"It is believed (and averred) that in no other town can you see in a place of refreshment such ingenious and beautiful decorations in the style of the new art as in Miss Cranston's shop in Buchanan Street. Indeed, so general in the city is this belief that it has caused the Glasgow man of the better sort to coin a new adjective denoting the height of beauty... 'It's quite Kate Cranston-ish !' \\" Kate Cranston expanded her first tearoom to take over the whole building at 114 Argyle Street and commissioned Walton to design a new more modern interior, which opened in 1898. Walton's work included fireplaces, stencilled wall murals and stained glass panels for the doors. In the luncheon room the murals and door panels had a rose pattern theme. The furniture was designed by Mackintosh, introducing for the first time his characteristic high-backed chairs. In 1900 Kate Cranston gave Mackintosh the opportunity to redesign an entire room, at the Ingram Street tearoom. He had just recently married the artist Margaret MacDonald, and together they created the White Dining Room, including a hallway opening onto the street and divided off by a wooden screen with leaded glass panels, giving those entering glimpses into the room itself. His fame was spreading, and in 1902 The Studio wrote of \\"Miss Cranston, whose tea-rooms, designed by Mr. Mackintosh, are reckoned by some of the pilgrims to Glasgow as one of the sights of the city.\\" =The Willow Tearooms= Miss Cranston's waitresses, seen in the Room de Luxe of the Willow Tea Rooms. Next Kate Cranston gave Mackintosh the major commission for an entire building in Sauchiehall Street, again in collaboration with his wife Margaret MacDonald on designs for the interiors. Behind a strikingly simple new fa√ßade this building provided three interlinked main tearooms at the ground floor and on a first floor gallery, with steps from that leading up a further half-storey to the famous \\"Room de Luxe\\" stretching the width of the building above the main entrance and front tearoom. In a humorous review of the new tearoom for the Glasgow Evening News titled Erchie in an Art Tea Room, Neil Munro described the \\"Room de Looks\\": ::::::\\"The chairs is no like ony ither chairs ever I clapped eyes on, but ye could easy guess they were chairs, and a' roond the place there's a lump o' looking-gless wi' purple leeks pented on it every noo and then.\\" In 1905 Dekorative Kunst featured a special issue about the Willow Tea Rooms written by Hermann Muthesius who advised that \\"Today any visitor to Glasgow can rest body and soul in Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms and for a few pence drink tea, have breakfast and dream that he is in fairy land.\\" =Further projects= Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh. Although the Willow Tearooms completed her chain, and remains the most famous of her tea rooms, Kate Cranston carried out several more projects, and Mackintosh provided increasingly innovative designs. In 1904 she commissioned him to carry out the redecoration and design of new furniture for the mansion of Hous'hill near NitshillOS Six-inch 1st edition, 1843-1882, Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland) which was home to herself and her husband John Cochrane. Mackintosh carried out further work on the Argyle Street tearoom in 1906 to design a basement conversion to form The Dutch kitchen. He did further redesigns for rooms in the Ingram Street tearooms, creating the Cloister Room and the Chinese Room in 1911. The latter provides an exotic fantasy, with bright blue finished timber screens incorporating a cashier's kiosk, elaborate door lintels and dark blue finished furniture, all in Mackintosh's version of an oriental style. In the same year Kate Cranston provided temporary \\"Exhibition Cafes\\" at the Scottish International Exhibition, apparently set up and designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, though nothing is now known of his scheme for this. The menu card designed by Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh shows the name for the tearooms, The White Cockade, but makes no visual connection with this reference to Jacobitism. It gives credit for supply of cakes to Miss Cranstons Bakery, 292 St Vincent St., Glasgow. Design for The Dug Out. In 1916 Kate opened Cranston's Cinema De Luxe in an entertainment complex designed for her by the architect James Miller, occupying the third floor of a six-storey building in Renfield Street, Glasgow. In 1917 Mackintosh carried out his last commission for Kate Cranston, and indeed one of his last architectural works to be constructed, with the design of an extension of the Willow Tea Rooms into the basement of the building next door to create The Dug Out in a style that anticipated Art Deco. Kate Cranston was greatly distressed when her husband died in 1917. She sold off her tea rooms and other businesses, and withdrew from public life. She had no children, and when she died in 1934 her will left two-thirds of her estate to the poor of Glasgow. Legacy The Room de Luxe of the Willow Tearooms today. Even though Kate Cranston had sold her tea rooms off, the name Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms long remained a byword for quality and for memories of Glasgow's heyday at the turn of the century. By 1938 tea rooms at 43 Argyll Arcade, 28 Buchanan Street, Renfield Street and Queen Street were being run by Cranston's Tea Rooms Ltd. They went into liquidation in 1954 and their premises were sold on for other uses. The Willow Tearooms were renamed, then in 1928 they were sold on to Daly's department store who incorporated the premises into their shop, keeping the Room de Luxe in operation as the department store tea room. Miss Cranston's Tearooms on Ingram Street continued in use as catering facilities from 1930 for Cooper's & Co., then in 1950 the rooms came into the ownership of Glasgow City Council and were used for storage and a souvenir shop. In 1971 the furnishings were removed into storage when the building was demolished, and they are now the only original set of Mackintosh tearoom interiors to survive. Ownership was transferred to Glasgow Museums in 1978, and after a further period of storage restoration work began in 1993. The Ladies' Luncheon Room was exhibited three years later, and the Chinese Room and Cloister Room have since been restored. The Glasgow Museums website reports that they are \\"currently assessing what will be needed to research and preserve the Charles Rennie Mackintosh interiors of the Ingram Street Tearooms for future public display.\\" and prospective plans now exist to install at least some of the interiors at the new V&A; museum in Dundee. It was decided to conserve and restore the Oak Room designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for the V&A; Museum of Design in Dundee. A short documentary about the conservation of the Oak Room was also commissioned by the V&A; museum. The restored Willow Tearooms building. While Mackintosh's reputation was eclipsed by the 1920s, he was later recognised as a pioneer of modern architecture, particularly in terms of the exterior of the Willow Tea Rooms. In the 1960s a resurgence of interest in Art Nouveau brought him international fame, and the furniture and designs he and his wife created for Kate Cranston are now extremely valuable. When Daly's closed, the Willow Tea Rooms were restored to an approximation of their original appearance. Catering reopened in the Room de Luxe, later extending to the recreated Tea Gallery, and was so successful that the business opened a new tearoom on the first floor of a building in Buchanan Street, near the original Buchanan Street and Ingram Street tearooms, fitted out with replicas of the White Dining Room and the Chinese Room from the Ingram Street tearoom. Confusingly, it trades under the name of The Willow Tea Rooms, as this now appears to be more familiar to visitors than Miss Cranston's name. However, these new tearooms draw renewed attention to the contribution Kate's patronage made to Mackintosh's work, and the impact she had on the social life of Glasgow is still remembered in popular books such as Tea at Miss Cranston's. The continuing interest in Miss Cranston is also reflected in the prices realised for items associated with her tearooms; for example ‚Ç§940 for six pieces of cutlery stamped Miss Cranston's. In October 2018, it was announced that Cranston would feature on a design for The Royal Bank of Scotland ¬£20 note to be circulated in 2020, the first woman other than Queen Elizabeth II to be depicted on a banknote of that denomination in that country (images of Nan Shepherd had been on a ¬£5, Mary Somerville and Mary Slessor on a ¬£10 and Elsie Inglis on a ¬£50 in the past, while notes issued by English banks had already featured Elizabeth Fry, Florence Nightingale and Jane Austen).

APMSO was founded by Altaf Hussain along with other students including Azeem Ahmed Tariq, Dr. Imran Farooq on Sunday, 11 June 1978 at Karachi University. Hussain also served as a 1st Chairman of organization while Azeem Ahmed Tariq served as 1st General Secretary of the organization. According to Altaf Hussain's autobiography \\"My Life's Journey\\". Between 1970 and 1971, Altaf Hussain joined the National Service Cadet Scheme. Soon afterwards, he was recruited in the Baloch Regiment of the Pakistan Army. Mr. Hussain has been politically active from a very young age. While attending the University of Karachi, he served as General Secretary and, later, as President of the National Students‚Äô Action Committee. He founded the All Pakistan Mohajir Students‚Äô Organization (APMSO) on 11 June 1978. The APMSO was formed as an activist group campaigning for the rights of Mohajir students at the University of Karachi. Later, in 1984, it gave birth a mainstream political party Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM).  Creation of APMSO & Philosophy  On 11th, June 1978 All Pakistan Mohair Students Organization (APMSO) was created by Altaf Hussain and others to provide the university students a way to fight injustice. It became popular among students of Karachi University. APMSO won student union election in 1980's. Many leaders rose from APMSO Azeem Ahmed Tariq, Imran Farooq, Farooq Sattar, Ishrat ul Ebad, Haider Abbas Rizvi and many others. According to APMSO website the philosophy of APMSO & MQM is Realism and Practicalism.  Mohajir identity  Mohajirs had never liked the idea of identifying themselves with Sindhi population on the basis of ethnicity or nationality and were always hostile of \\"Sindhi nationalism\\" instead of \\"ethnic nationalism.\\" But Ethno- nationalist politicians convinced them that circumstances needed them to seek their identity on ethnic lines.Ethnicity and State Power in Pakistan The Muhajir sense of isolation came into being through a series of events. The three most important being the 1964 presidential elections, the 1972 language riots, and the post-1985 ethnic clashes between Muhajirs and non-Muhajirs in Karachi. \\"During the December 1964 presidential elections, the Muhajir population of Karachi experienced a wrath of a Pathan backlash when Gohar Ayub Khan, son of President Ayub Khan, launched a series of attacks on Muhajir communities because of their support for Fatimah Jinnah, the sister of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, against Ayub Khan.\\" Though Gohar Ayub's intentions were to target those who opposed his father, ethno-nationalists portrayed the move as specifically targeting MuhajirsProfessor Moonis Ahmar, University of Karachi At this time Ayub Khan moved the federal capital from Karachi to Islamabad, causing further anger amongst the elite of the Muhajir community, especially the bureaucracy. The 1972 language riots were caused by the passage of a language bill by the Sindhi Assembly declaring Sindhi to be the provincial language along with Urdu. The making of Sindhi as an equal language to Urdu for official purposes frustrated the elite of the Muhajir community as it disfavored their hegemony over the region. His regime's policies denationalized banks, insurance companies, and other big businesses. Initially, two banks were transferred from government to private management. Soon the government had earmarked 125 industrial units for privatization.Pakistan in 1991: Light and Shadows In June 1978 the All Pakistan Muhajir Student Organization was formed and it took on the task of creating a sense of distinction amongst Muhajir youth, on linguistic line, from the rest of Pakistanis. From the APMSO, in March 1984, was created the Muhajir Qaumi Movement. Now called the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), its leader declares its ideology to be based on Realism and Practicalism. \\"Acceptance of reality with an open heart is Realism, a concept based upon the philosophy of its Founder and Leader Mr. Altaf Hussain. Based on Realism positive achievement made through ideologically supported pragmatic programs is called Practicalism.\\" Official MQM Website  APMSO to MQM  From the early days APMSO faced many attacks by the Thunder Squad of Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT). Jamiat has feared to loss its strong hold in university by APMSO. Therefore, the Leadership of Islami Jamiat Talaba gives task to its notorious \\"Thunder Squared\\" which is led by Munawar Hasan to remove APMSO and its leadership from university. In 1981 Thunder Squad attack by knives and revolver on stalls of APMSO at university gates and badly wounded 16 members of APMSO including founder of APMSO Altaf Hussain and then the squad entry of APMSO in university. Subsequently, Hussain decided to establish a National Political Party for Mohajir and then he found Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) on 18 March 1984. MQM also achieve success as APMSO and in very short time, the philosophy of Altaf Hussain and MQM spread all over Sindh especially in Karachi, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah and Sukker.

Karachi University and Youth Politics  Karachi University has been the hub of student political activity for many decades. \\"Student politics were born with the formation of Islami Jamiat Talba (IJT) and the Democratic Students' Federation (DSF) in 1948.\\"The News International Since then, numerous student political groups have emerged throughout the country representing different races, ethnicities, cultures, and ideologies. \\"In the first few decades of Pakistan's existence, student politics was a symbol of the students' socio- political awareness.\\" But change was quick and drastic, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. \\"Karachi University, like its host city, has always been a melting pot for students from all over the country. Its grounds have seen the spirited expression of various socio-political schools of thought, the gradual desensitisation of students after the military takeover of 1979 as well as the violent military crackdown on the APMSO-PSF conflict in 1993 that was followed by the indefinite deployment of Rangers on campus.\\" In April 1984 General Zia Ul-Haq imposed a ban on all student organizations throughout the country, which prohibited the \\"formation and continuance\\" of student unions and stipulated a punishment of violators of the regulation by rigorous imprisonment up to five years, by a fine, or by both.Pakistan:A Country Study, Richard F. Nyrop Although political parties still exist on campus, authorities deny their presence. Because of the constant rise in violence, the number of student political activists has dropped tremendously. Today parents \\"fearfully raise their children to mind their own business, study to build careers, not ideologies and lead safe, peaceful lives in sheltered cocoons. While student attendance may be full at academic, entertainment, or sports events organized by these parties, for any other events, students hesitate.\\" Despite constant condemnation by university administration, media and even the general student body, these parties maintain that they still have a role to play in society. Some students attribute this intolerance to the intolerance of university authorities for students' expressions against injustice. Nabeel Husain, in charge of APMSO's KU wing, adds to the case for political restoration of students, \\"We propose the restoration of a student union that has equal participation from all students. What we want is a students' parliament accommodating all the students in a peaceful, free environment.\\" According to the APMSO's KU Organizer Nabeel Husain, the alleged party workers had in fact nothing to do with APMSO, and that there have been numerous cases of students belonging to certain ethnic groups using the APMSO name to get out of attending classes. He insisted that his party strongly condemns students' missing classes for any reason. However, Nabeel does agree that security threats are indeed an issue and that the party has in the past requested the administration to provide security to some workers threatened by rival parties persisting to destroy the peace of the university.  NAQEEB  This is a quarterly Urdu magazine featuring articles, reports, poetries and other materials which is in interest of students. Naqeeb is publishing by Gehwara-e- Adab with the collaboration of APMSO from the head-office of Gehwara-e-Adab. NAQEEB is quite popular among students. The meaning of NAQEEB is \\"Harbinger\\".

The band originally formed in 1986, although they released no studio recordings until 2005. They have been noted to be one of the first influential bands in the desert rock scene. History Yawning Man was formed in 1986, founded by members Gary Arce, Alfredo Hern√°ndez, Mario Lalli, and Larry Lalli. At this time, the band started to play marathon jams during sets performed in the only readily available venues at the time: garages around town and impromptu concerts staged in the nearby desert. As word spread of these parties they evolved into what were called \\"generator parties\\" which were informal concerts held deep in the uninhabited desert outskirts of the cities in the Coachella valley, gradually attracting larger and larger crowds to their shows. Their music heavily influenced the likes of John Garcia, Josh Homme, and Brant Bjork (who would later form the stoner rock band Kyuss) to name only a few. When Hernandez played in Kyuss on their last album ...And the Circus Leaves Town (1995) they recorded a cover of Yawning Man's song \\"Catamaran\\". From 1986 to 1987, 30 to 40 songs were recorded on 2 different demos but no official Yawning Man material was ever released until 2005. Yawning Man's music began to mutate into strange loops with an almost dark/free-form jazz punk sound, and the name of the band just didn't fit the music anymore. The band changed name to The Sort of Quartet and in the mid '90s released three albums with SST Records and one with German label Hot Wax Crippled Dick. During this time, the Lalli cousins also achieved recognition with their band Fatso Jetson, which briefly included Arce. In 2005, Yawning Man's first LP Rock Formations was released on the Spanish label Alone Records. It is a collection of 10 tracks recorded in late 2004 and described as \\"a melancholic mix of acoustic space rock with elements of surf music, as well as middle eastern guitar style\\". Months later, Pot Head, a four-track EP, would be released. In 2006, Rock Formations was re-released with a limited edition bonus DVD recorded at W2 club in Den Bosch, Netherlands on June 17, 2005, during their European tour. In 2007, Yawning Man was to release a collection of past material on a double CD known as The Birth of Sol Music. It was to be a collection of 30 older songs from the late '80s with an extensive booklet including information about the band and the whole Palm Desert connection. According to band member Gary Arce, this release has been postponed indefinitely. In 2009, The Birth of Sol Music (The Demo Tapes) was released on iTunes as a two-disc set containing 24 songs. In 2007, an LP called Vista Point, a combination of the Rock Formations and Pot Head releases, was released. In 2009, members of Yawning Man collaborated with British band Sons of Alpha Centauri to release the album Ceremony to the Sunset under the band name Yawning Sons. The album was well received by music critics, with Echoes and Dust labelling it a \\"classic\\". In 2014, members of Sons of Alpha Centauri stated that a follow-up to the album would be considered once they released their own second album. In 2010, Yawning Man released their second studio album Nomadic Pursuits under the imprint of Cobraside Records. Its cover art was composed and delivered by Hern√°ndez. Following the release of the album, the band embarked on a tour across Europe with Bill Stinson and Billy Cordell replacing Hern√°ndez and Mario Lalli as touring members respectively. The Nomadic Pursuits tour concluded with a headline show at the DesertFest in London and Berlin in April 2013 with Yawning Sons and Fatso Jetson. The band then self-released a dedicated tour vinyl with Fatso Jetson. In August 2014, Yawning Man returned to Europe with Arce, Mario Lalli and Stinson for a tour that ran from August 29 to September 7, after which they undertook the Legends of the Desert Tour with Fatso Jetson from February 2 to 28, 2015. In 2016, Yawning Man released their third studio album Historical Graffiti, which marked the first studio recordings to feature Stinson on drums. The album was recorded by Leonardo Checheccia at Ion Studios in Buenos Aires, Argentina while the band were on tour. The first vinyl pressings were released by Lay Bare Records and later re-released by Cobraside Records. In 2017, Yawning Man went on their first ever tour of the United States and Canada to support the album's release. In 2018, Yawning Man released their fourth studio album The Revolt Against Tired Noises. The album was recorded at Gatos Trail Studio in Joshua Tree, CA and produced and engineered by friend and long time collaborator, Mathias Schneeberger (Mark Lanegan, Greg Duli, SUNN O))), Earth, The Obsessed). Six of the eight songs are in the instrumental tradition the band is mostly known for, however two tracks feature the rare appearance of a vocalist (bassist Mario Lalli) alongside Gary Arce‚Äôs dream weaving guitar work and Bill Stinson's drums. One of these tracks of notable mention is the song ‚ÄúCatamaran‚Äù, a Yawning Man song made popular by the legendary influential desert rock band Kyuss on the 1995 Elektra release ‚ÄúAnd the Circus Leaves Town‚Äù.

It cost ¬£35,000 and was officially opened by Bishop Wheeler on 11 February 1965. The parish of St Francis of Assisi was divided in 1967 and St Clare's became a separate parish.St Clare's parish website This was caused by the greatly increased quantity of housing built in the locality and the consequent increased population. The church is of a fairly large size and of a typical design for churches built in the 1960s.

Harbert III (born June 15, 1955) is an American broadcasting and television executive.

In a 2005 article in Advertising Age, Harbert wrote, ‚ÄúI started poring over the ratings in Nielsen 'Pocket Pieces' when I was 9 years old. Two years later, I learned there were jobs at networks that picked shows and decided where they went on the schedule. From that moment, I wanted one of those jobs.‚Äù Harbert began his broadcasting career while a student at Boston University‚Äôs college radio station, WTBU, where he worked alongside his friend, Howard Stern. After graduating magna cum laude with a degree in Broadcasting and Film from the Boston University School of Communications, Harbert returned to New York, where he worked at ABC.

The greater redhorse (Moxostoma valenciennesi) is a species of freshwater fish found in northeastern North America. It is the largest member of the genus Moxostoma, with a maximum length of 80 cm (31.5 in). Distribution and habitat The greater redhorse is endemic to states in the northcentral and northeastern United States as well as Ontario and Quebec in Canada. It is typically found in clear, relatively fast-moving rivers and in both shallow and deep waters in some lakes. They are unable to survive in even the slightest polluted waters. They, therefore have the ability to detect contaminated water sources. Description The greater redhorse is the largest fish in its genus, averaging around 46 cm (18 in) and 2 kg (4.4 lb), and reaching a maximum size of 80 cm (31.5 in) and 5.9 kg (13 lb). This species of fish has small eye sockets in contrast to their large rounded skull. On either side of the greater redhorse's body are reddish gold pectoral fins and pelvic fins. The posterior part of the dorsal fin varies from slightly concave at youth to slightly convex in adulthood. Their tail fins are only slightly notched, a trait that usually evolved in slow swimming bottom-feeders. The greater redhorse is most easily identified by its bright rusty red colored tail fin and the rows of black spots along its sides and back. Diet habits A bottom-feeder's mouth opens in the inferior position of the ventral surface of the fish. It feeds on various bottom dwelling organisms including, microcrustaceans, aquatic and larval insects, detritus, snails, and algae. Reproduction and life cycle Spawning for the greater redhorse begins in May or June. Before they are able to build their gravel and sand nests, they locate an area in moderately fast waters. Once male territories are established, the females will visit two males at a time and begin their spawning process. The two males will surround the female and perform a shaking motion releasing both the sperm and eggs from said gendered fish. Upon burial of the eggs, the parents leave with no further parental care provided. Following fertilization, the greater redhorse eggs will hatch six to eight days at a mean temperature of 19 ¬∞C. Growth rates of this species are controversial among various areas they inhabit. Relationship with humans Overall, the greater redhorse is being threatened in many of the northern states it calls home. In general, it is not a popular sporting fish. However, the greater redhorse's status as a prey species is unknown. Because this species is impacted greatly by pollutants, their endangered status may come from a decreased conscientiousness of where wastes are disposed of. The IGFA world record for the species stands at 12lb 7oz caught from the Sauk River near Melrose, Minnesota in 2005.
