The spar carries flight loads and the weight of the wings while on the ground. Other structural and forming members such as ribs may be attached to the spar or spars, with stressed skin construction also sharing the loads where it is used. There may be more than one spar in a wing or none at all. However, where a single spar carries the majority of the forces on it, it is known as the main spar.Thom 1988, p. 152. Spars are also used in other aircraft aerofoil surfaces such as the tailplane and fin and serve a similar function, although the loads transmitted may be different from those of a wing spar. Spar loads The wing spar provides the majority of the weight support and dynamic load integrity of cantilever monoplanes, often coupled with the strength of the wing 'D' box itself. Together, these two structural components collectively provide the wing rigidity needed to enable the aircraft to fly safely. Biplanes employing flying wires have much of the flight loads transmitted through the wires and interplane struts enabling smaller section and thus lighter spars to be used at the cost of increasing drag. =Forces= Some of the forces acting on a wing spar are:Taylor 1990, p. 72. *Upward bending loads resulting from the wing lift force that supports the fuselage in flight. These forces are often offset by carrying fuel in the wings or employing wing-tip- mounted fuel tanks; the Cessna 310 is an example of this design feature. *Downward bending loads while stationary on the ground due to the weight of the structure, fuel carried in the wings, and wing-mounted engines if used. *Drag loads dependent on airspeed and inertia. *Rolling inertia loads. *Chordwise twisting loads due to aerodynamic effects at high airspeeds often associated with washout, and the use of ailerons resulting in control reversal. Further twisting loads are induced by changes of thrust settings to underwing-mounted engines.Taylor 1990, p. 146. The \\"D\\" box construction is beneficial to reduce wing twisting. Many of these loads are reversed abruptly in flight with an aircraft such as the Extra 300 when performing extreme aerobatic manoeuvers; the spars of these aircraft are designed to safely withstand great load factors. Materials and construction =Wooden construction= Early aircraft used spars often carved from solid spruce or ash. Several different wooden spar types have been used and experimented with such as spars that are box-section in form; and laminated spars laid up in a jig, and compression glued to retain the wing dihedral. Wooden spars are still being used in light aircraft such as the Robin DR400 and its relatives. A disadvantage of the wooden spar is the deteriorating effect that atmospheric conditions, both dry and wet, and biological threats such as wood-boring insect infestation and fungal attack can have on the component; consequently regular inspections are often mandated to maintain airworthiness.FAA 1988, p. 25. Wood wing spars of multipiece construction usually consist of upper and lower members, called spar caps, and vertical sheet wood members, known as shear webs or more simply webs, that span the distance between the spar caps. Even in modern times, \\"homebuilt replica aircraft\\" such as the replica Spitfires use laminated wooden spars. These spars are laminated usually from spruce or douglas fir (by clamping and glueing). A number of enthusiasts build \\"replica\\" Spitfires that will actually fly using a variety of engines relative to the size of the aircraft. =Metal spars= honeycomb 'D' box leading edge A typical metal spar in a general aviation aircraft usually consists of a sheet aluminium spar web, with \\"L\\" or \\"T\\" -shaped spar caps being welded or riveted to the top and bottom of the sheet to prevent buckling under applied loads. Larger aircraft using this method of spar construction may have the spar caps sealed to provide integral fuel tanks. Fatigue of metal wing spars has been an identified causal factor in aviation accidents, especially in older aircraft as was the case with Chalk's Ocean Airways Flight 101.NTSB report - Grumman Turbo Mallard, N2969 Retrieved: 1 February 2009 =Tubular metal spars= The German Junkers J.I armoured fuselage ground-attack sesquiplane of 1917 used a Hugo Junkers-designed multi-tube network of several tubular wing spars, placed just under the corrugated duralumin wing covering and with each tubular spar connected to the adjacent one with a space frame of triangulated duralumin strips ‚Äî usually in the manner of a Warren truss layout ‚Äî riveted onto the spars, resulting in a substantial increase in structural strength at a time when most other aircraft designs were built almost completely with wood-structure wings. The Junkers all-metal corrugated-covered wing / multiple tubular wing spar design format was emulated after by American aviation designer William Stout for his 1920s-era Ford Trimotor airliner series, and by Russian aerospace designer Andrei Tupolev for such aircraft as his Tupolev ANT-2 of 1922, upwards in size to the then-gigantic Maksim Gorki of 1934. A design aspect of the Supermarine Spitfire wing that contributed greatly to its success was an innovative spar boom design, made up of five square concentric tubes that fitted into each other. Two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar.Taylor 1990, p. 80. A version of this spar construction method is also used in the BD-5, which was designed and constructed by Jim Bede in the early 1970s. The spar used in the BD-5 and subsequent BD projects was primarily aluminium tube of approximately in diameter, and joined at the wing root with a much larger internal diameter aluminium tube to provide the wing structural integrity. =Geodesic construction= In aircraft such as the Vickers Wellington, a geodesic wing spar structure was employed, which had the advantages of being lightweight and able to withstand heavy battle damage with only partial loss of strength. =Composite construction= Many modern aircraft use carbon fibre and Kevlar in their construction, ranging in size from large airliners to small homebuilt aircraft. Of note are the developments made by Scaled Composites and the German glider manufacturers Schempp-Hirth and Schleicher.Taylor 1990, p. 95. These companies initially employed solid fibreglass spars in their designs but now often use carbon fibre in their high performance gliders such as the ASG 29. The increase in strength and reduction in weight compared to the earlier fibreglass-sparred aircraft allows a greater quantity of water ballast to be carried.Hardy 1982, p. 86. = Multi-spar construction = Aircraft utilizing three or more spars are considered multi- spar aircraft. Using multiple spars allows for an equivalent overall strength of wing, but with multiple, smaller, spars, which in turn allow for a thinner wing or tail structure (at a cost of increased complexity and difficulty of packaging additional equipment such as fuel tanks, guns, aileron jacks, etc.). Although multi-spar wings have been used since at least the 1930s (for example, the World War 2-era Curtiss P-40 had 3 spars per wing), they gained greater popularity when the increasing speed of jet fighters demanded thinner wings to reduce drag at high speeds. The Mach 2 F-104 Starfighter used numerous slender spars to allow for a wing of unusually thin section; the F-16 Fighting Falcon uses a similar construction. Other aircraft like the F-4 Phantom, F-15 Eagle and others use 3 or more spars to give sufficient strength in a relatively thin wing, and thus qualify as multi-spar aircraft. False spars False spars, like main spars, are load bearing structural members running spanwise but are not joined to the fuselage. Their most common purpose is to carry moving surfaces, principally ailerons.Kuma 2005 p.265  References  =Notes= =Bibliography= * Federal Aviation Administration, Acceptable Methods, Techniques and Practices-Aircraft Inspection and Repair, AC43.13.1A, Change 3.

Early life and education  Born in Rochester, New York, the son of Absalom Bell Page and Elizabeth Thomas, he moved with his family in 1890 to Bronte, Ontario. He attended Oakville Junior High School, Hamilton Collegiate Institute, Ontario Normal School, and Queen's University. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University, and a Bachelor of Commercial Science degree from the American Institute of Business. In 1906, he accepted a teaching position at Rothesay Collegiate in Rothesay, New Brunswick. In 1907, he switched to the St. Thomas Collegiate Institute where he taught until 1912. In 1910 J. Percy Page married Maude Roche, daughter of Gilbert Roche, of St. Thomas, Ontario. They had one daughter: Patricia Hollingsworth. In 1912 Percy took a position in Edmonton, Alberta to introduce commercial training into the Edmonton high school system. Before retiring from teaching in 1952, he would be a Principal at two Edmonton high schools.  Coaches Edmonton Grads  While at the McDougall Commercial High School in 1914-15 he was the coach of the senior girls' basketball team. He continued to coach the same girls after graduation on a team that became known as The Edmonton Grads. The team under his tutorship would become one of the most successful teams of all time in sport, winning 502 of 522 games, for a winning percentage of .961, and winning all 27 Olympic matches they played in the Olympics in 1924, 1928, 1932 and 1936. However, women's basketball was not an official Olympic sport until 1976. In 1955, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame as a basketball builder.  Political career  In the 1940 Alberta election, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the Edmonton electoral district as a member of the Independent Citizen's Association, an anti-Social-Credit alliance of Conservatives, Liberals and others, of which he was a leading member. He was re-elected in 1944. From 1945 to 1948, he was the Leader of the Opposition. He was defeated in 1948, but was elected in 1952 as a Progressive Conservative. In 1952, he was appointed House Leader for the Progressive Conservatives. He was re- elected in 1955. He lost re-election in 1959. From 1957 to 1959, he was also a trustee of the Edmonton Public School Board. In 1959, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta and served until 1966.

Creation myths develop through oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions.\\" of the Abrahamic religions, she was the first woman. Eve is known also as Adam's wife. According to the second chapter of Genesis, Eve was created by God (Yahweh) by taking her from the rib of Adam, to be Adam's companion. Adam is charged with guarding and keeping the garden before her creation; she is not present when God commands Adam not to eat the forbidden fruit ‚Äì although it is clear that she was aware of the command. She succumbs to the serpent's temptation to eat the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. She shares the fruit with Adam, and as a result the first humans are expelled from the Garden of Eden. Christian churches differ on how they view both Adam and Eve's disobedience to God (often called the fall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of humanity. Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam (the first man) and Eve to a different level of responsibility for the fall, although Islamic teaching holds both equally responsible. Along with Adam, the Catholic Church by ancient tradition recognizes Eve as a saint. The traditional liturgical feast of Saints Adam and Eve has been celebrated on 24 December since the Middle Ages in many European nations, including Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, and the Scandinavian nations. Etymology Creation of Eve Marble relief by Lorenzo Maitani on the Orvieto Cathedral, Italy \\"Eve\\" in Hebrew is \\"·∏§awwƒÅh\\" and is most commonly believed to mean \\"living one\\" or \\"source of life\\" as it is phonetically similar to \\"·∏•ƒÅy√¢\\", \\"to live\\", from the Semitic root ·∏•yw.American Heritage Dictionary HawwƒÅh has been compared to the Hurrian goddess Kheba, who was shown in the Amarna letters to be worshipped in Jerusalem during the Late Bronze Age. It has been suggested that the name Kheba may derive from Kubau, a woman who was the first ruler of the Third Dynasty of Kish.The Weidner \\"Chronicle\\" mentioning Kubaba from A. K. Grayson, Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles (1975)Munn, Mark (2004). \\"Kybele as Kubaba in a Lydo-Phrygian Context\\": Emory University cross-cultural conference \\"Hittites, Greeks and Their Neighbors in Central Anatolia\\" (Abstracts) The goddess Asherah, wife of El, mother of the elohim from the first millennium BCE was given the title Chawat, from which the name Hawwah in Aramaic was derived, Eve in English.Dever, William K (2005), Did God Have A Wife? Archaeology And Folk Religion In Ancient Israel (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company) It has been suggested that the Hebrew name Eve () also bears resemblanceSaul Olyan, Asherah (1988), pp. 70‚Äì71, contested by O. Keel to an Aramaic word for \\"snake\\" (Old Aramaic language ; Aramaic ). The origins for this etymological hypothesis is the rabbinic pun present in Genesis Rabbah 20:11, utilizing the similarity between Heb. Chavvah and Aram. chivviya. Notwithstanding its rabbinic ideological usage, scholars like Julius Wellhausen and Theodor N√∂ldeke argued for its etymological relevance. In Genesis The Creation of Eve, from the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo =Creation= William Blake's pencil illustration of The Creation of Eve in response to the line \\"And She Shall Be Called Woman\\". The object was created c. 1803‚Äì1805 and currently is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art In Genesis 2:18‚Äì22, the woman is created to be ezer ki-negdo, a term that is notably difficult to translate, to the man. Ki-negdo means \\"alongside, opposite, a counterpart to him\\", and ezer means active intervention on behalf of the other person. The woman is called ishah, woman, with an explanation that this is because she was taken from ish, meaning \\"man\\"; the two words are not in fact connected. Later, after the story of the Garden is complete, she will be given a name, ·∏§awwƒÅh (Eve). This means \\"living\\" in Hebrew, from a root that can also mean \\"snake\\". A long-standing exegetical tradition holds that the use of a rib from man's side emphasizes that both man and woman have equal dignity, for woman was created from the same material as man, shaped and given life by the same processes. In fact, the word traditionally translated \\"rib\\" in English can also mean side, chamber, or beam. Rib is a pun in Sumerian, as the word \\"'\\" means both \\"rib\\" and \\"life\\". God created Eve from \\"\\" (tsela), traditionally translated as \\"one of his ribs\\". The term can mean curve, limp, adversity and side. The traditional reading has been questioned recently by feminist theologians who suggest it should instead be rendered as \\"side\\", supporting the idea that woman is man's equal and not his subordinate.For the reading \\"side\\" in place of traditional \\"rib\\", see Such a reading shares elements in common with Aristophanes' story of the origin of love and the separation of the sexes in Plato's Symposium.Cf. Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative, Basic Books, 1983, p. 31. A recent suggestion, based upon observations that men and women have the same number of ribs, speculates that the bone was the baculum, a small structure found in the penis of many mammals, but not in humans. =Expulsion from Eden= Adam and Eve expelled from Eden, by Hans Heyerdahl, 1877 Eva by Lucas Cranach the Elder (1528) Eve is found in the Genesis 3 expulsion from Eden narrative which is characterized as a parable or \\"wisdom tale\\" in the wisdom tradition. This narrative portion is attributed to Yahwist (J) by the documentary hypothesis due to the use of YHWH. In the expulsion from Eden narrative a dialogue is exchanged between a legged serpent and the woman (3:1‚Äì5). The serpent is identified in 2:19 as an animal that was made by Yahweh among the beasts of the field. The woman is willing to talk to the serpent and respond to the creature's cynicism by repeating Yahweh's prohibition from 2:17. The serpent directly disputes Yahweh's command. Adam and the woman sin (3:6‚Äì8). Yahweh questions Adam, who blames the woman (3:9‚Äì13). Yahweh then challenges the woman to explain herself, who blames the serpent, who is cursed to crawl on its belly, so losing its limbs. Adam, Eve, and the (female) serpent at the entrance to Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, is the portrayal of the image of the serpent as a mirror of Eve was common in earlier iconography as a result of the identification of women as the source of human original sin. Divine pronouncement of three judgments are then laid against all culprits (3:14‚Äì19). A judgement oracle and the nature of the crime is first laid upon the serpent, then the woman, and finally Adam. After the serpent is cursed by Yahweh, the woman receives a penalty that impacts two primary roles: childbearing and her subservient relationship to her husband. Adam's penalty thus follows. The reaction of Adam, the naming of Eve, and Yahweh making skin garments are described in a concise narrative (3:20‚Äì21). The garden account ends with an intradivine monologue, determining the couple's expulsion, and the execution of that deliberation (3:22‚Äì24). =Mother of humanity= Eve (and womankind after her) is sentenced to a life of sorrow and travail in childbirth, and to be under the power of her husband. Adam and Eve had two sons, Cain and Abel (Qayin and He·∏áel), the first a tiller of the ground, the second a keeper of sheep. After the death of Abel, Eve gave birth to a third son, Seth (≈†et), from whom Noah (and thus the whole of modern humanity) is descended. According to Genesis, Seth was born when Adam was 130130 according to the Masoretic Text; 230 according to the Septuagint. Larsson, Gerhard. ‚ÄúThe Chronology of the Pentateuch: A Comparison of the MT and LXX.‚Äù Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 102, no. 3, 1983, p. 402. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3261014. years old \\"a son in his likeness and like his image\\". Genesis 5:4 says that Eve had sons and daughters beyond just Cain, Abel, and Seth. In other works Lilith, by John Collier, 1889 Certain concepts such as the serpent being identified as Satan, Eve's sin being sexual temptation, or Adam's first wife being Lilith, come from literary works found in various Jewish apocrypha, but not found anywhere in the Book of Genesis or the Torah itself. She is remembered in De Mulieribus Claris, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature. Writings dealing with these subjects are extant literature in Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Armenian and Arabic, going back to ancient Jewish thought. Their influential concepts were then adopted into Christian theology, but not into modern Judaism. This marked a radical split between the two religions. Some of the oldest Jewish portions of apocrypha are called Primary Adam Literature where some works became Christianized. Examples of Christianized works is The Book of Adam and Eve, known as the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, translated from the Ethiopian Ge'ez by Solomon Caesar Malan (1882)First translated by August Dillmann (Das christl. Adambuch des Morgenlandes, 1853), and the Ethiopic book first edited by Trump (Abh. d. M√ºnch. Akad. xv., 1870‚Äì1881). and an original Syriac work entitled Cave of TreasuresDie Schatzh√∂hle translated by Carl Bezold from three Syriac MSS (1883), edited in Syriac (1888). which has close affinities to the Conflict as noted by August Dillmann. * In the Jewish book The Alphabet of Ben-Sira, Eve is Adam's \\"second wife\\", where Lilith is his first. In this alternate version, which entered Europe from the East in the 6th century, it suggests that Lilith was created at the same time, from the same earth (Sumerian Ki), as Adam's equal, similar to the Babylonian Lilitu, Sumerian Ninlil wife of Enlil. Lilith refuses to sleep or serve under Adam. When Adam tried to force her into the \\"inferior\\" position, she flew away from Eden into the air where she copulated with demons, conceiving hundreds more each day (a derivation of the Arabic djinn). God sent three angels after her, who threatened to kill her brood if she refused to return to Adam. She refuses, leaving God to make a second wife for Adam, except this time from his rib. * The Life of Adam and Eve, and its Greek version Apocalypse of Moses, is a group of Jewish pseudepigraphical writings that recount the lives of Adam and Eve after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden to their deaths. * The deuterocanonical Book of Tobit affirms that Eve was given to Adam as a helper (viii, 8; Sept., viii, 6). Religious views =Judaism= In the first creation narrative (Elohim) account, it says \\"male and female [Elohim] created them\\" (Genesis 1:27), which has been interpreted to imply simultaneous creation of the man and the woman. Whereas the second creation account states that YHWH created Eve from Adam's rib, because he was lonely (Genesis 2:18 ff.). Thus to resolve this apparent discrepancy, some medieval rabbis suggested that Eve from the second account, and the woman of the Elohim account, were two separate individuals: Eve and Lilith. The creation of Eve, according to Rabbi Joshua, is that: \\"God deliberated from what member He would create woman, and He reasoned with Himself thus: I must not create her from Adam's head, for she would be a proud person, and hold her head high. If I create her from the eye, then she will wish to pry into all things; if from the ear, she will wish to hear all things; if from the mouth, she will talk much; if from the heart, she will envy people; if from the hand, she will desire to take all things; if from the feet, she will be a gadabout. Therefore I will create her from the member which is hid, that is the rib, which is not even seen when man is naked.\\"Polano, Hymen (1890). The Talmud. Selections from the contents of that ancient book... Also, brief sketches of the men who made and commented upon it, p. 280. F. Warne, , digitized by Google Books on 7 July 2008 According to the Midrash of Genesis Rabba and other later sources, either Cain had a twin sister, and Abel had two twin sisters, or Cain had a twin sister named Lebuda, and Abel a twin sister named Qelimath. The traditional Jewish belief is that Eve is buried in the Cave of Machpelah. Midrash Rabbah Genesis VIII:1 interprets \\"male and female He created them\\" to mean that God originally created Adam as a hermaphrodite. In this way, adam was bodily and spiritually male and female. God later decides that \\"it is not good for adam to be alone\\", and creates the separate beings, Adam and Eve. This promotes the idea of two people joining together to achieve a union of the two separate spirits. The early rabbinic literature contains also the traditions which portray Eve in a less positive manner. According to Genesis Rabbah 18:4 Adam quickly realizes that Eve is destined to engage in constant quarrels with him. The first woman also becomes the object of accusations ascribed to Rabbi Joshua of Siknin, according to whom Eve, despite the divine efforts, turned out to be ‚Äúswelled- headed, coquette, eavesdropper, gossip, prone to jealousy, light-fingered and gadabout‚Äù (ibid. 18:2). A similar set of charges appears in Genesis Rabbah 17:8, according to which Eve's creation from Adam's rib rather than from the earth makes her inferior to Adam and never satisfied with anything. Finally, the gravest evils attributed to Eve appear in Genesis Rabbah 17:8: > Why does a man go out bareheaded while a woman goes out with her head > covered? She is like one who has done wrong and is ashamed of people; > therefore she goes out with her head covered. Why do they [the women] walk > in front of the corpse [at a funeral]? Because they brought death into the > world, they therefore walk in front of the corpse, [as it is written], ‚ÄúFor > he is borne to the grave ... and all men draw after him, as there were > innumerable before him‚Äù (Job 21:32f). And why was the precept of > menstruation (nidah) given to her? Because she shed the blood of Adam [by > causing death], therefore was the precept of menstruation given to her. And > why was the precept of ‚Äúdough‚Äù (·∏•alah) given to her? Because she corrupted > Adam, who was the dough of the world, therefore was the precept of dough > given to her. And why was the precept of the Sabbath lights (nerot shabat) > given to her? Because she extinguished the soul of Adam, therefore was the > precept of the Sabbath lights given to her.Genesis Rabbah, in: Judaic > Classics Library, Davka Software. (CD-ROM). In addition to this, the early rabbinic literature contains numerous instances in which Eve is accused of various sexual transgressions. Told in Genesis 3:16 that ‚Äúyour desire shall be for your husband,‚Äù she is accused by the Rabbis of having an overdeveloped sexual drive (Genesis Rabbah 20:7) and constantly enticing Adam (ibid. 23:5). However, in terms of textual popularity and dissemination, the motif of Eve copulating with the primeval serpent takes priority over her other sexual transgressions. Despite rather unsettling picturesqueness of this account, it is conveyed in numerous places: Genesis Rabbah 18:6, Sotah 9b, Shabat 145b‚Äì146a and 196a, Yevamot 103b and ‚ÄòAvodah zarah 22b. =Christianity= Some Early Church Fathers interpreted 2Cor.11:3 and 1Tim.2:13‚Äì14 that the Apostle Paul promoted the silence and submission of women due to Eve's deception by the serpent, her tempting Adam to eat the fatal fruit, and transgressing by eating of the fruit herself. Tertullian told his female listeners, in the early 2nd century, that they \\"are the devil's gateway\\", and went on to explain that all women are responsible for the death of Christ: \\"On account of your desert ‚Äì that is, death ‚Äì even the Son of God had to die.\\" Saint Augustine, in his excursuses on the fall narrative in Genesis, which led to the Catholic doctrine of original sin, blamed Adam for sin rather than Eve. The City of God, Book XIII His reasoning was that, because sin lies in the soul and not the body and because he understood reproductive intercourse to comprise a material (bodily) contribution from the female and a spiritual (soul) contribution from the male, then original sin could not be based upon the transgressions of Eve. Rather, her sin was both forgivable, because she was deceived by the serpent, and lacked consequences for human history, because she could not transmit sin to her descendants. Adam, on the other hand, had full knowledge of his sin and out of lust chose a life of sin with the woman over a life with God. This Augustinian teaching is also rooted in Paul: \\"sin entered the world through one man.\\" (Rom 5:12). Gregory of Tours reported that in the Third Council of M√¢con (585 CE), attended by 43 bishops, one bishop maintained that woman could not be included under the term \\"man\\" as she was responsible for Adam's sin, and had a deficient soul. However, his case was declined and did not press the issue further. Eve, in Christian art, is most usually portrayed as the temptress of Adam, and often during the Renaissance the serpent in the Garden is portrayed as having a woman's face identical to that of Eve. She was also compared with the Greco-Roman myth of Pandora who was responsible for bringing evil into the world. Some Christians claim monogamy is implied in the story of Adam and Eve as one woman is created for one man. Eve's being taken from his side implies not only her secondary role in the conjugal state (1 Corinthians 11:9), but also emphasizes the intimate union between husband and wife, and the dependence of her to him. In conventional Christianity, Eve is a prefigurement of Mary, mother of Jesus who is also sometimes called \\"the Second Eve\\".

She is equated with the light-maiden of Sophia, creator of the word (Logos) of God, the thygater tou photos or simply the Virgin Maiden, Parthenos. In other texts she is equated with Zoe (Life).Krosney, Herbert (2007) \\"The Lost Gospel: the quest for the Gospel of Judas Iscariot\\" (National Geographic) In other Gnostic texts, such as the Hypostasis of the Archons, the Pistis Sophia is equated with Eve's daughter, Norea, the wife of Seth. =Islam= Painting from Manafi al-Hayawan (The Useful Animals), depicting Adam and Eve. From Maragheh in Iran, 1294‚Äì99 Adam's spouse is mentioned in the Quran in Chapter (surah) 2 verses 30‚Äì39 of Sura 2 (Q2:30‚Äì39), Q7:11‚Äì25, Q15:26‚Äì42, Q17:61‚Äì65, Q18:50‚Äì51, Q20:110‚Äì124, and Q38:71‚Äì85, but the name \\"Eve\\" (Arabic: , ·∏§awwƒÅ‚Äô) is never revealed or used in the Quran. Eve is mentioned by name only in hadith.Beyond The Exotic: Women's Histories In Islamic Societies ‚Äì Page 9, Amira El Azhary Sonbol ‚Äì 2005 Accounts of Adam and Eve in Islamic texts, which include the Quran and the books of Sunnah, are similar but different to that of the Torah and Bible. The Quran relates an account in which God created \\"one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women\\" (Surah Al-Nisa 4:1), but there are hadiths that support the creation of woman \\"from a rib\\" (Sahih Bukhari 4:55:548, Sahih Bukhari 7:62:114, Sahih Muslim 8:3467, Sahih Muslim 8:3468). Eve is not blamed for enticing Adam to eat the forbidden fruit (nor is there the concept of original sin). On the contrary, the Quran indicates that \\"they ate of it\\" and were both to blame for that transgression (Quran 20:121‚Äì122). There are subsequent hadiths (narrated by Abu Hurairah), the authenticity of which is contested, that hold that Muhammad designates Eve as the epitome of female betrayal. \\"Narrated Abu Hurrairah: The Prophet said, 'Were it not for Bani Israel, meat would not decay; and were it not for Eve, no woman would ever betray her husband.'\\" (Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 611, Volume 55). An identical but more explicit version is found in the second most respected book of prophetic narrations, Sahih Muslim. \\"Abu Hurrairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (May peace be upon him) as saying: Had it not been for Eve, woman would have never acted unfaithfully towards her husband.\\" (Hadith 3471, Volume 8). =Bah√° º√≠ Faith= In the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, the account of Eve is described in Some Answered Questions. \`Abdu'l-Bah√° describes Eve as a symbol of the soul and as containing divine mysteries.Revisioning the Sacred: New Perspectives on a Bah√° º√≠ Theology ‚Äì Volume 8 ‚Äì Page 215 Jack McLean ‚Äì 1997 The Bah√° º√≠ Faith claims the account of Eve in previous Abrahamic traditions is metaphorical.Earth Circles: Bah√° º√≠ Perspectives on Global Issues ‚Äì Page 77, Michael Fitzgerald ‚Äì 2003 Family tree See also * Hebat * Mitochondrial Eve * Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: ** Apocalypse of Adam ** Books of Adam ** Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan ** Life of Adam and Eve ** Testament of Adam * Ophidiophilia * Paradise Lost * Pre-Adamite * Shatarupa * Tomb of Eve References =Bibliography= * A translation with commentary. * Flood, John (2010).

The longitudinal motion consists of two distinct oscillations, a long-period oscillation called a phugoid mode and a short-period oscillation referred to as the short-period mode. =Phugoid (longer period) oscillations= The longer period mode, called the \\"phugoid mode\\" is the one in which there is a large-amplitude variation of air-speed, pitch angle, and altitude, but almost no angle-of- attack variation. The phugoid oscillation is a slow interchange of kinetic energy (velocity) and potential energy (height) about some equilibrium energy level as the aircraft attempts to re-establish the equilibrium level-flight condition from which it had been disturbed. The motion is so slow that the effects of inertia forces and damping forces are very low. Although the damping is very weak, the period is so long that the pilot usually corrects for this motion without being aware that the oscillation even exists. Typically the period is 20‚Äì60 seconds. This oscillation can generally be controlled by the pilot. =Short period oscillations= With no special name, the shorter period mode is called simply the \\"short-period mode\\". The short- period mode is a usually heavily damped oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The motion is a rapid pitching of the aircraft about the center of gravity, essentially an angle-of-attack variation. The time to damp the amplitude to one-half of its value is usually on the order of 1 second. Ability to quickly self damp when the stick is briefly displaced is one of the many criteria for general aircraft certification. Lateral-directional modes \\"Lateral-directional\\" modes involve rolling motions and yawing motions. Motions in one of these axes almost always couples into the other so the modes are generally discussed as the \\"lateral-directional modes\\".\\"Lateral\\" is used although the rolling motions are about the longitudinal axis There are three types of possible lateral-directional dynamic motion: roll subsidence mode, spiral mode, and Dutch roll mode. =Roll subsidence mode= Roll subsidence mode is simply the damping of rolling motion. There is no direct aerodynamic moment created tending to directly restore wings-level, i.e. there is no returning \\"spring force/moment\\" proportional to roll angle. However, there is a damping moment (proportional to roll rate) created by the slewing- about of long wings. This prevents large roll rates from building up when roll-control inputs are made or it damps the roll rate (not the angle) to zero when there are no roll-control inputs. Roll mode can be improved by dihedral effects coming from design characteristics, such as high wings, dihedral angles or sweep angles. =Dutch roll mode= The second lateral motion is an oscillatory combined roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, perhaps because of its similarity to an ice-skating motion of the same name made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3‚Äì15 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing a yaw damper, in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the yaw damper becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and a failed yaw damper is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower Mach numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved. = Spiral divergence = Spiraling is inherent. Most aircraft trimmed for straight-and-level flight, if flown stick-fixed, will eventually develop a tightening spiral-dive.Perkins, Courtland; Hage, Robert (1949). Airplane performance stability and control. John Wiley and Sons. p. 431. If a spiral dive is entered unintentionally, the result can be fatal. A spiral dive is not a spin; it starts, not with a stall or from torque but with a random, increasing roll and airspeed. Without prompt intervention by the pilot, this can lead to structural failure of the airframe, either as a result of excess aerodynamic loading or flight into terrain. The aircraft initially gives little indication that anything has changed. The pilot's \\"down\\" sensation continues to be with respect to the bottom of the airplane, although the aircraft actually has increasingly rolled off the true vertical. Under VFR conditions, the pilot corrects for this deviation from level automatically using the true horizon, while it is very small; but in IMC or dark conditions it can go unnoticed: the roll will increase and the lift, no longer vertical, is insufficient to support the airplane. The nose drops and speed increases; the spiral dive has begun. The forces involved Say the roll is to the right. A sideslip develops, resulting in a slip-flow which is right-to-left. Now examine the resulting forces one at a time, calling any rightward influence yaw-in, leftward yaw-out, or roll-in or -out, whichever applies. The slip-flow will: * push the fin, rudder, and other side areas aft of c.g. to the left, causing a right yaw-in, * push side areas ahead of the c.g. to the left, causing a left yaw-out, * push the right wingtip up, the left down, a left roll-out owing to the dihedral angle, * cause the left wing to go faster, the right wing slower, a roll-in, * push the side areas of the aircraft above the c.g. to the left, a roll-out, * push the side areas of the aircraft below the c.g. to the left, a roll-in, Also, an aerodynamic force is imposed by the relative vertical positions of the fuselage and the wings, creating a roll-in leverage if the fuselage is above the wings, as in a low wing configuration; or roll-out if below, as in a high-wing configuration. A propeller rotating under power will influence the airflow passing it. Its effect depends on throttle setting (high at high rpm, low at low) and the attitude of the aircraft. Thus, a spiral dive results from the netting-out of many forces depending partly on the design of the aircraft, partly on its attitude, and partly on its throttle setting (a susceptible design will spiral dive under power but may not in the glide). Recovery  A diving aircraft has more kinetic energy (which varies as the square of speed) than when straight-and- level. To get back to straight-and-level, the recovery must get rid of this excess energy safely. The sequence is: Power all off; level the wings to the horizon or, if horizon has been lost, to the instruments; reduce speed using gentle back-pressure on the controls until a desired speed is reached; level off and restore power. The pilot should be alert to a pitch up tendency as the aircraft is rolled to wings level.

It confers the title of Fellow upon nominated social scientists following a process of peer review. The Academy comprises over 1000 Fellows and 41 learned societies based in the UK and Europe.  History and structure  The Academy‚Äôs origins lie in the formation of a representative body for the social science learned societies in 1982, the Association of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences (ALSISS). From 1999 to 2007 it was called the Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences before changing to its current name.JordanWatch.uk , retrieved on 17 March 2010 The Academy is run by a Council of 21 members, with Professor Roger Goodman FAcSS as its current Chair, and Professor Sir Ivor Crewe FAcSS, Master of University College, Oxford, as its current President. 7 Council members are elected by the Academy‚Äôs Fellows, 7 by its Learned Societies and 7 are appointed.Academy website Since 2019, its Chief Executive has been Rita Gardner FAcSS. =List of Presidents= * 2003‚Äì2008: Bhikhu Parekh, Baron Parekh * 2008‚Äì2013: Sir Howard Newby * 2014‚Äì2019: Sir Ivor Crewe * 2020‚Äìpresent: Roger Goodman  Advocacy  The Academy advocates social science by interacting with Government and other organisations, and co-ordinates the responses of social scientists to Government consultation documents. Past consultations include: * Independent Review of Implementation of RCUK Policy on Open Access. * Public Administration Select Committee Enquiry on 'Building Civil service Skills for the Future' * The Office for National Statistics consultation on the future of the Census Academy website The Academy also puts forward suggestions to the Government about which social scientists should carry out its Foresight research projects,BIS website which look at important issues and how these might change over the next 20 to 80 years. A developing part of the Academy‚Äôs work is to bring researchers and organisations using research closer together to improve the evidence upon which public policy is based and to increase the impact of research.  Publications and events  The Academy has produced a series of ‚ÄòMaking the Case for the Social Sciences‚Äô booklets which give examples of important social science research which has made a difference to policy or practice. These are: Wellbeing; Ageing; Sustainability; the Environment and Climate Change; Crime; Sport and Leisure; Management; Scotland; Longitudinal Studies, Mental Wellbeing, Wales and Dementia. Further titles are in preparation. The Academy also publishes a cross-disciplinary peer-reviewed journal, Contemporary Social Science. The Academy holds regular events, such as conferences on the ethics of social media research and the future of the Research Excellence Framework. It holds an Annual Lecture each summer, and its President's Lunch each winter. It also arranges (with the British Library) a public lecture series Enduring Ideas. Fellows Part of the Academy‚Äôs work is to recognise social scientists who are held in esteem by their peer group and whose life and work have had an impact in advancing social science. They are nominated and the nominations are then subject to peer review. Fellows are academics, policy-makers and practitioners, and are entitled to use the letters \\"FAcSS\\" after their name. In November 2014 there were 1000 Fellows, just over 1% of the 90,000 total membership of the 41 learned society members of the Academy.

After two full-length tales about rabbits, Potter had grown weary of the subject and was reluctant to write another. She realized however that children most enjoyed her rabbit stories and pictures, and so reached back to characters and plot elements from The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902) and The Tale of Benjamin Bunny (1904) to create The Flopsy Bunnies. A semi-formal garden of archways and flowerbeds in Wales at the home of her uncle and aunt became the background for the illustrations. In The Flopsy Bunnies, Benjamin Bunny and his cousin Flopsy are the parents of six young rabbits called simply The Flopsy Bunnies. The story concerns how the Flopsy Bunnies, while raiding a rubbish heap of rotting vegetables, fall asleep and are captured by Mr. McGregor who places them in a sack. While McGregor is distracted, the six are freed by Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse, and the sack filled with rotten vegetables by Benjamin and Flopsy. At home, Mr. McGregor proudly presents the sack to his wife, but receives a sharp scolding when she discovers its actual content. Modern critical commentary varies. One critic points out that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created. Background Potter, 1912 The Tale of Peter Rabbit and its three sequels are the best known and most successful of Potter's books. The author had an affinity for rabbits; she lived with them as pets and observed them closely for years. Though she once wrote that rabbits were creatures of \\"warm volatile temperaments\\" and were \\"shallow and extremely transparent\\", she invested her rabbits with a variety of characterizations consistent with the nature of the animal. All the rabbit tales were inspired in part by Joel Chandler Harris's Uncle Remus stories, which Potter began illustrating as early as 1893 in an attempt to find career direction and probably because they featured a rabbit as principal player. Although she incorporated Harris's \\"rabbit-tobacco\\" and his \\"lippity-clippity, clippity-lippity\\" (as \\"lippity- lippity\\") into her literary vocabulary, she was unable to bring his characters to the English country garden as Victorian gentlemen - they remained inexorably fixed in the Antebellum American South as slaves and slave owners. Harris's wily Br'er Rabbit is motivated by vengeance and wins by cunning, but Potter's rabbits have no such motivation and succeed due to their adventurous spirit and pure luck.MacDonald 1986, pp. 23‚Äì4 Helen Beatrix Potter was born in Kensington, London on 28 July 1866 to wealthy parents, and educated at home by a series of governesses and tutors. She displayed artistic talent early, drawing and sketching mammals, insects, reptiles and amphibians, flowers and plants. In the early 1890s, she enjoyed her first professional artistic success when she sold six designs to a greeting card publisher.Gatford 2004, pp. 4,15 On 16 December 1901, she privately issued The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and, on 2 October 1902, a trade edition of the tale was released by Frederick Warne & Co. to great success.Taylor 1996, pp. 72,76 She published tales similar in content, style, and format for Warnes in the years to follow, and, in 1904, The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, a sequel to Peter Rabbit.Kutzer 2003, p.50,65 In July 1905, Potter bought Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District with the profits from her books and a small legacy left her by an aunt; the farm became her home away from London and her artistic retreat. In a few years, Potter had established her own career, income, and home.Kutzer 2003, p. 67 The main street in Near Sawrey photographed by Potter's father in May 1913 Early in the autumn of 1908, Potter wrote her publisher Harold Warne that she had several ideas for new books. She sent him the text of The Faithful Dove, a tale set in Rye she had composed years earlier and for which she had produced a group of sketches. With it, she included a sequel to The Tale of Benjamin Bunny starring Benjamin's offspring, The Flopsy Bunnies. Though she had complained at times that the rabbit characters had become \\"wearisome\\",MacDonald 1986, p. 42 she had written a young fan, William Warner, that children liked her rabbits best and that she ought to write another rabbit book. The third tale she sent Warne was about the village shop in Sawrey. \\"I should like to get rid of one of them,\\" she wrote Warne about her story ideas, \\"When a thing is once printed I dismiss it from my dreams! & don't care what becomes of the reviewers. But an accumulation of half finished ideas is bothersome.\\" The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and the story about the shop (eventually The Tale of Ginger and Pickles) were chosen for publication in 1909.Lear 2007, pp. 224‚Äì5 The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies was finished in March 1909 and published in July of the same year.Lear 2007, p. 225 In conjunction with the tale, Potter created a series of letters from The Flopsy Bunnies decreasing in size and competence of execution according to each bunny's position in the family. The letters from the youngest fifth and sixth bunnies are miniature epistles of nothing but scribbles and kisses. Thomasina Tittlemouse, the tale's \\"resourceful\\" heroine, became the main character of her own book in 1910 titled The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse.Lear 2007, p. 234 Plot In The Flopsy Bunnies, Benjamin Bunny and Peter Rabbit are adults, and Benjamin has married his cousin Flopsy (one of Peter's sisters). As for Peter, Mopsy, and Cotton-Tail, they haven't been married yet and still live with their mother (Mrs. Josephine Rabbit). The couple are the parents of six young rabbits generally called The Flopsy Bunnies. Benjamin and Flopsy are \\"very improvident and cheerful\\" and have some difficulty feeding their brood. At times, they turn to Peter Rabbit (who has gone into business as a florist and keeps a nursery garden), but there are days when Peter cannot spare cabbages.In the original frontispiece to the tale, a sign over the garden tended by Peter and his mother reads, \\"Peter Rabbit and Mother ‚Äì Florists ‚Äì Gardens neatly razed. Borders devastated by the night or year\\". The illustration was eventually replaced (probably in the third printing) because of the difficulty in lettering the noticeboard in non-English editions (MacDonald 1986, p. 40;Linder 1976, plate 8). It is then that the Flopsy Bunnies cross the field to Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap of rotten vegetables.MacDonald 1986, p. 40 One day they find and feast on lettuces that have shot into flower, and, under their \\"soporific\\" influence, fall asleep in the rubbish heap, though Benjamin puts a sack over his head. Mr. McGregor discovers them by accident when tipping grass-clippings down and places them in a sack and ties it shut then sets the sack aside while attending to another matter. Benjamin and Flopsy are unable to help their children, but a \\"resourceful\\" wood mouse called Thomasina Tittlemouse, gnaws a hole in the sack and the bunnies escape. The rabbit family (Benjamin, Flopsy, and the Flopsy bunnies) fill the sack with rotten vegetables (two decayed turnips and three rotten vegetable marrows). Then the animals mend the hole which Thomasina Tittlemouse made. Afterwards, they hide under a bush to observe Mr. McGregor's reaction. Mr. McGregor does not notice the replacement (as the bunnies have replaced the six baby rabbits with the rotten vegetables), and carries the sack home (still thinking he has the six baby rabbits), continually counting the six rabbits (he says, \\"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\\"). The McGregors do not know that the youngest Flopsy Bunny is out there and eavesdropping. His wife Mrs. McGregor (thinking the rotten vegetables are the six rabbits) claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. However, she reaches into the sack and feels the vegetables (which she had thrown out the day before) and discovers them. When she felt the rotten vegetables, she becomes very, very, angry. She accuses her husband of playing a trick on her (saying to him, \\"You silly man! You've made a fool out of me! And you have done it on purpose!\\"). Mr. McGregor also becomes very angry, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting the youngest of the eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill. When the rotten vegetable marrow hits the youngest Flopsy bunny, it breaks his arm. Their parents decide it is time to go home. With the Mc Gregors defeated once again, they are left to argue. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens. Scholar M. Daphne Kutzer points out that Mr. McGregor's role is larger in The Flopsy Bunnies than in the two previous rabbit books, but he inspires less fear in The Flopsy Bunnies than in Peter Rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist is diminished when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes.Kutzer 2003, p. 56 Nonetheless, for young readers, he is still a frightening figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them.Kutzer 2003, pp. 55‚Äì6 Illustrations In February 1909, Potter went to Hill Top, where, kept indoors by the inclement weather, she worked diligently on the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies. Various gardens became the backgrounds for Peter Rabbit (Camfield Place, Lakefield, Lingholm, Tenby in South Wales, Bedwell Lodge, and Gwaeynynog),Lear 2007, p. 154 and Fawe Park in Keswick became the background for Benjamin Bunny,Taylor 1987, p. 116 but the background for The Flopsy Bunnies was a semi-formal garden of archways, walks, and flowerbeds in Wales at Denbigh at the estate called Gwaeynynog. Gwaeynynog was the home of the Burtons, Potter's uncle and aunt, and, while on holiday in 1909, Potter sketched their walled garden, and, once at home, decided to move Peter and Benjamin and their families to Wales for another Peter Rabbit sequel. A number of her preliminary sketches still survive.Taylor 1987, p. 140 Since her first visit to Gwaeynynog fourteen years before the composition of The Flopsy Bunnies, Potter had sketched the garden many times. She described it following a visit in 1895: \\"The garden is very large, two-thirds surrounded by a red brick wall with many apricots, and an inner circle of old grey apple trees on espaliers. It is very productive but not tidy, the prettiest kind of garden, where bright old-fashioned flowers grow amongst the currant bushes.\\" Early in 1909 she wrote to her publisher, \\"I have done lots of sketches - not all to the purpose - and will now endeavour to finish up the F. Bunnies without further delay.\\"Taylor 1996, p. 113 Judy Taylor, author of several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had difficulty drawing the human form, and, as a result of her limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his hands and feet. Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his hands and feet in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.Taylor 1996, p. 212 Edward Lear's picture of seven guinea pigs beneath a lettuce from The History of the Seven Families of Lake Pipple-popple possibly inspired a similar illustration in The Flopsy Bunnies.Hallinan 2008, p. 76 In contrast to her limitations with the human form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with the position of the tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.MacDonald 1986, pp. 41‚Äì2 Potter's weariness with depicting rabbits is reflected in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen the garden and its structures. There are almost no close-ups of the rabbits and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When the rabbits are depicted, they are viewed in the middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.Beatrix Potter, Flopsy Bunnies, a drawing in pen and ink with watercolour , British Museum; Taylor 1987, p. 212 Themes Like Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, the story of The Flopsy Bunnies is about rabbits intruding upon the human domain and bringing the threat of death and destruction upon themselves by their own imprudence.MacDonald 1986, p. 41 M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh indicates in Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code that the tale's principal theme is the trickster animal, though she is careful to point out that, even then, the animals are subordinate to the exquisite garden backgrounds. The reader's interest in the tale, she believes, lies in following the joke played upon McGregor rather than in the dull personalities of the rabbits. Although the trickster qualities of the rabbits are evident but muted in the earlier Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, in Flopsy Bunnies these qualities are brought to center stage.Kutzer 2003, p. 54 Kutzer notes that The Flopsy Bunnies belongs not to the title characters but to their parents - it is they who save the baby bunnies - and thus the story is often of less interest to children. Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University and author of Beatrix Potter points out that, as in Benjamin Bunny, domesticity is implicitly approved in the tale but reflects a sea-change in Potter‚Äôs life and work. Peter no longer raids McGregor‚Äôs garden for vegetables but grows his own and has his plot surrounded with a fence and chicken wire to keep predatory bunnies out. In effect, he has become McGregor. He is Potter's alter ego and, though he is a mature rabbit in The Flopsy Bunnies, he is still living at home with his mother and tending a garden with her - like Potter, who had achieved a degree of independence by 1909 but was not entirely free of her parents.Kutzer 2003, p. 57 Style MacDonald indicates Potter was particularly sensitive to the openings and closings of her books (she insisted Benjamin Bunny end with the term \\"rabbit-tobacco\\", for example), and, in the Flopsy Bunnies, the opening reflects her flair for the elevated diction sometimes encountered in her other books: \\"It is said the effect of eating too much lettuce is 'soporific'.\\" Though the word 'soporific' is not generally encountered in literature for young children, Potter is aware of her audience's limitations and not only defines the word immediately but places it in context: \\"I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit.\\" She not only defines the word, but introduces rabbits as her subject. The line does not draw attention to itself (though Potter is intruding herself into the narrative), but rather gives the tale a conversational tone or a sense of the story being told aloud by a narrator. Because she immediately brings the audience's attention back to the rabbits, there is no danger she will become a character in the tale, and she is invisible through the remainder of the tale.MacDonald 1986, pp. 42‚Äì3 Potter uses elevated language again when the rabbit family is described as \\"improvident and cheerful\\". Though \\"improvident\\" is not immediately defined, the cheerfulness of the family is made evident in the accompanying illustration of the bunnies romping in their burrow while their parents look upon their offspring with placid contentment. Their improvidence is suggested however in the next two pages of text which describe Benjamin's borrowing of cabbages from his cousin Peter, and the family's occasional resort to Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap in times when Peter cannot spare any cabbages. Mr. McGregor and the rubbish heap are enduring constants in the rabbit universe of the tale, and because they are, the threat of starvation in the line \\"... there was not always enough to eat\\" is mitigated. Benjamin and Flopsy may not always be able to provide for their family, but food is available, even if it is not theirs by right. \\"Improvident\\" then is defined by course of action, and the lack of an immediate definition nonetheless carries the narrative forward and the reader's curiosity about its meaning is satisfied.MacDonald 1986, p. 43 Though Mr. McGregor is a distant, awkward, menacing presence in the pictures, for the first time he is given language which serves to define him. He counts the bunnies in what is presumably a Scottish accent: \\"six leetle fat rabbits\\", and argues with his wife about buying \\"baccy\\". These and Mrs. McGregor's claim that he has tricked her and \\"done it a purpose\\" demonstrate Potter's attention to using dialect and dialogue as a means of defining character - in this instance, of contrasting their manner of speaking with her own in narrating the story. Tone Scholars and critics detect in the narrative voice a certain lack of interest and lack of emotional involvement in The Flopsy Bunnies that they ascribe to various factors. MacDonald points out that the plot is simple and designed to capture the attention of young children, but suspects that Potter was more involved in the locale rather than the characters. Potter had at one time declared the rabbit characters \\"wearisome\\", and the brevity with which she treats them in The Flopsy Bunnies suggests that this was her attitude to the book as a whole. Potter biographer Linda Lear, author of Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature observes that Potter had great affection for Peter Rabbit, but the sequels never held quite the same appeal for her because neither sprang to life from story and picture letters to children in the manner of Peter Rabbit. She believes the sequels lack the sort of vitality that distinguishes Peter.Lear 2007, pp. 182‚Äì3 Kutzer thinks the two sequels not up to Potter's usual narrative standards because both sprang from a public demand for more \\"bunny books\\" rather than from any desire on Potter's part to continue the rabbit stories. Neither of the tales spoke to Potter emotionally in the manner of Peter Rabbit, she points out, and speculates that Potter associated rabbits with the less than happy life she passed in her parents' London home. Kutzer believes that once Potter gained a life of her own and freed herself from domineering parents, she was reluctant to return to material which evoked unpleasant memories.Kutzer 2003, pp. 49‚Äì50  Merchandise  Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the process in making them so was marketing strategy.MacDonald 1986, p. 128 She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales with spinoffs such as a Peter Rabbit doll, an unpublished Peter Rabbit board game, and Peter Rabbit nursery wallpaper between 1903 and 1905.Lear 2007, pp. 172‚Äì5 Similar \\"side-shows\\" (as she termed the ancillary merchandise) were produced with her approval over the following two decades.Taylor 1987, p. 106 After Potter's death in December 1943, Frederick Warne & Co. granted licences to various firms for the production of merchandise based on the Potter characters. Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire released six porcelain figurines beginning in 1965 depicting characters or scenes from the tale: Flopsy, Mrs. Tittlemouse, Benjamin Bunny, Peter Rabbit Digging, a Flopsy and Benjamin Bunny tableau, and a tableau depicting the sleeping bunnies under the lettuce.Dubay 2006, pp. 30,32,35-6 and, in 1984, Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts released a Flopsy Bunnies music box, a flat ceramic Flopsy Christmas ornament, and in 1985 a Flopsy music box.Dubay 2006, pp. 106‚Äì8 Stuffed toy manufacturers had sought licensing rights as early as 1906 for Potter's characters, but it was not until the 1970s that an English firm was granted worldwide rights. Their labour-intensive products were unprofitable however, and in 1972, The Eden Toy Company of New York became the exclusive manufacturer of Potter characters. Although Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor were released as plush toys, they were associated with the Peter Rabbit tale and not with that of The Flopsy Bunnies. None of The Flopsy Bunnies characters were released as Eden plush toys.Dubay 2006, pp. 91‚Äì2  Reprints and translations  In 2010, all of Potter's 23 small format books were still in print, and some, including The Flopsy Bunnies, were available in formats such as audiobook and Kindle. All 23 tales were available in a 400-page single volume, as individual volumes, and in complete collections of individual volumes offered in presentation boxes. First editions were available through antiquarian booksellers. The English language editions of the little books still bear the Frederick Warne imprint though the company was bought by Penguin Books in 1983. The printing plates for the Potter books were remade from new photographs of the original drawings in 1985, and all 23 volumes released in 1987 as The Original and Authorized Edition.Taylor 1996, p. 216 Potter's small format books have been translated into nearly thirty languages including Greek and Russian. The Tale of Peter Rabbit was the first of the small format books to be translated into a non-English language when Het Verhaal van Pieter Langoor was published in 1912 by Nijgh & Ditmar's Uitgevers Maatschappij, Rotterdam. Peter Rabbit has since been published in braille (1921), in the International Phonetic Alphabet (1968), and in the hieroglyphic script of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2005). The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies was published in French as La Famille Flopsaut in 1931, in Afrikaans as Die Varhall van Die Flopsie-Familie in 1935, in Dutch as Die Kleine Langoortjes in 1946 and again in Dutch as Het Verhaal van De Woolepluis-Konijntjes in 1969, in German as Die Geschichte Der Hasenfamilie Plumps in 1947, and in Japanese in 1971 under licence to Fukuinkan-Shoten, Tokyo. The tale was published in the Initial Teaching Alphabet in 1965.Linder 1971, pp. 433‚Äì37 In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a traditional part of childhood in both English-speaking lands and those in which the books had been translated.MacDonald 1987, p. 130 Adaptations In 1995, the story was adapted, together with The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, as part of the anthology series The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.

The native of Martins Ferry, Ohio, threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He served in the United States Navy during World War II in the Pacific Theater of Operations, as an aviation machinist's mate, third class.Baseball in Wartime Playing career Like many at his position, Lipon was never known for his power, but he wasn't an exceptional fielder, either. One of the most memorable moments of his playing career was in 1951, when Bob Feller of the Indians threw his third career no-hitter, but lost the shutout when Lipon reached on an error, stole second base, advanced to third on an errant pickoff throw, and scored on a sacrifice fly. In 1952, Lipon was part of a trade to the Red Sox that included longtime star Johnny Pesky going to the Tigers. His playing time diminished, and in the 1953 season, he was sold to the St. Louis Browns. In 1954, the Browns moved east to Baltimore, but Lipon was quickly traded to the Chicago White Sox. Before playing a game for the White Sox, however, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds. He had one National League at-bat before he was farmed to the new Havana Sugar Kings of the International League. He played in the high minors several years, evolving into a player/coach. As manager and coach In 1959, Lipon became a minor league manager, beginning at the Class D level with the Selma Cloverleafs of the Alabama‚ÄìFlorida League in the Cleveland Indians' organization. Lipon spent 30 of the next 34 years as a manager in the Cleveland, Detroit and Pittsburgh Pirates farm systems, winning 2,185 games and losing 1,987 (.524). He spent part of the 1961 season as manager of the Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, and his success as skipper of the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in the mid-1960s earned him a promotion to the Indians' coaching staff, where he served from 1968‚Äì1971. Lipon's only chance at a Major League managing job came during the 1971 season, when Cleveland fired Alvin Dark on July 29 with 59 games left and Lipon was named to finish the season as interim pilot.Dark fired by Cleveland But the Indians went only 18‚Äì41 (.305) under him, good for last place in the American League East, 43 games behind the Baltimore Orioles. Lipon returned to managing in the minors the next season with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, and continued for the next two decades. He retired from managing after the 1992 season. His last club, the Lakeland Tigers of the Florida State League, won its division's second- half championship. In 1992 he was presented with the King of Baseball award given by Minor League Baseball.

It is currently in a free museum in Redcar. The name Zetland comes from the local Lord of Manor, the Marquess of Zetland. The Zetland is on the National Register of Historic Ships, as part of the National Historic Fleet. The lifeboat was stationed at Redcar in 1802, built by Henry Greathead of South Shields. Not all rescue attempts were successful. On Christmas Day 1836, a crewman was washed from the Zetland and drowned during a vain attempt to save the crew of the Danish brig Caroline. The man, William Guy, was a Tees pilot, and it is said that he left a service in chapel to take his place in the lifeboat. During 1858 the Tees Bay Lifeboat Society decided to hand over the administration of their boats to the RNLI. On 17 February 1864, the Zetland sustained damage whilst rescuing the crew of seven from the brig Brothers. The RNLI considered the old boat no longer fit for service and supplied a new self-righting lifeboat named Crossley. Arrangements were made to have the Zetland broken up and a local carpenter was employed to carry out the task. An angry crowd prevented the work commencing and, after negotiation, the boat was given to the townspeople providing it would not 'compete' with the new RNLI lifeboat. In 1872, the Zetland was repaired following fundraising which totalled ¬£100. In 1880, it was launched with two other Redcar lifeboats (the Crossley and the Emma) and saved seven sailors' lives from the brig Luna. Zetland Lifeboat Museum The boat was the centrepiece of 1963 International Lifeboat Conference in Edinburgh. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, the Zetland lifeboat remains fully preserved and open for public visits in the Zetland Lifeboat Museum, which is a listed building on the Esplanade, Redcar, just a few hundred yards from the present Redcar Lifeboat Station.

He served as the head football coach the University of Houston from 1990 to 1992, compiling a record of 18‚Äì15. A proponent of the run and shoot offense, Jenkins also coached professional football in the United States Football League (USFL), the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL). He served as the head coach of the CFL's Ottawa Renegades in 2006, the FXFL's Blacktips in 2014 and the Hudson Valley Fort for part of 2015. During his career as a coach, Jenkins has mentored a number of notable quarterbacks such as Andre Ware, David Klingler, Jim Kelly, Eric Crouch, Kliff Kingsbury, Anthony Calvillo and Doug Flutie. Early life and playing career Jenkins was raised in Pampa, Texas. He played college football at the University of Arkansas. Coaching career =Houston Gamblers= After serving as the special teams coach for the Houston Gamblers of the USFL in 1984, Jenkins was promoted to offensive coordinator in 1985 with the departure of Mouse Davis, who moved to the Denver Gold as head coach. Jenkins kept the run and shoot offense that Davis has installed, but modified the offense into his own version. In Jenkins' debut as offensive coordinator against Steve Young and the Los Angeles Express, the Gamblers trailed 33‚Äì13 with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter. Employing a hurry-up offense, the Gamblers came back to win the game 34‚Äì33. Since the game was not televised, Sports Illustrated dubbed it \\"The Greatest Game Never Seen\\". In the fourth week of the 1985 season, the Gamblers met Davis' Denver Gold in the first game ever to pit two run and shoot offenses. The two offenses showed only small similarities as Jenkins employed various new tactics such as motioning receivers out of the backfield and going into empty sets. The Gamblers won 36‚Äì17. After the game, quarterback Jim Kelly was on pace to finish the season with 7,434 yards and 78 touchdowns. But due to a leg injury, he missed six games of the regular season and he fell well short of those marks. However, Kelly and his backup, Todd Dillon, combined 6,118 yards passing on the season, a record for professional American football. The Gamblers offense also featured three receivers‚ÄîClarence Verdin, Gerald McNeil, and Richard Johnson‚Äîthat each totaled over 1,000 yards, a rarity that only Don Coryell's San Diego Chargers accomplished in the early 1980s. The Gamblers made the playoffs with a 10‚Äì8 record, and lost to the Birmingham Stallions, 22‚Äì20. Dream Team In 1986, Donald Trump, owner of the New Jersey Generals, bought the Houston Gamblers. The Gamblers and the Generals were merged, matching the USFL's leading rusher, Herschel Walker, with its leading passer, Kelly, and creating what ESPN called the \\"Dream Team\\". There were also rumors of Jenkins installing a two-quarterback system with Doug Flutie in the slot. However, after a failed attempt to launch the season in the fall, the USFL folded, and the \\"Dream Team\\" never took the field. =Houston Cougars= Offensive coordinator Jenkins moved to the University of Houston and joined the Houston Cougars football staff as the offensive coordinator in 1987. There he inherited a veer option offense featuring Andre Ware, who only threw one touchdown pass his entire high school career, and converted it into one of the most prolific passing attacks in college football history. When Jenkins joined the Cougars, he had further developed his offense from a pure run and shoot attack into what he referred to as the \\"Multiple Adjusting Passing Offense\\" or \\"MAPO\\". Jenkins' new offense made an immediate impact in the Southwest Conference as Houston beat the Texas Longhorns handily in each of his first three seasons: 60‚Äì40 in 1987, 66‚Äì15 in 1988, and 47‚Äì9 in 1989. In 1988, Jason Phillips and James Dixon became the first two college football receivers to finish a season with over 100 catches. In 1989, Houston scored over 40 points in nine of their 11 games, including a 95‚Äì21 rout of SMU in which they racked up 1,021 yards of offense. Ware finished the season with 4,699 yards and 44 touchdowns, set 26 NCAA records, and won the Heisman Trophy. The 1989 Houston offense averaged 624.9 total yards per game and 10.1 yards rushing per carry, both national records. Head coach In 1990, Cougars head coach Jack Pardee left the team to take the head coaching position with the National Football League's Houston Oilers. Jenkins was promoted to head coach of the Cougars. With Ware gone, David Klingler took over at quarterback and continued the success of Jenkins' passing attack. Klingler threw for over 400 yards in nine of 11 games in 1990, including a 716-yard performance against Arizona State in the Coca-Cola Classic. He averaged 474.6 yards a game, a national record. Klingler also broke the national record for most touchdown passes in a game with 11 against Eastern Washington. He completed the season with 5,140 yards and 54 touchdowns, outpacing Ware's totals from 1989, but fell short in the Heisman race, finishing fifth behind winner Ty Detmer and three others. Houston finished the season 10‚Äì1. Their only loss came against Texas. The Cougars were not allowed to go to a bowl game due to NCAA sanctions for violations under former coach Bill Yeoman. Jenkins' teams featured the nation's leading receiver each year from 1987 to 1992. The Cougars started the 1991 season poised to pick up right where they left off. After routing Louisiana Tech 73-3 in the first game of the season, the next game was a nationally televised road game against the Miami Hurricanes. They lost 40-10. Houston won only seven more games during the remainder of Jenkins' tenure. He resigned under fire in the spring of 1993. =Canadian Football League= After leaving Houston, Jenkins landed a job as a defensive backs coach with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Jenkins coached with a number of CFL teams before joining the Toronto Argonauts as the offensive coordinator. There Jenkins installed a new offense built around the strengths of quarterback, Doug Flutie. The Argonauts won the Grey Cup in 1997. =FXFL= Jenkins was appointed as head coach for the Fall Experimental Football League's Blacktips for the 2014 season. In 2015, he became the head coach of the Hudson Valley Fort. He quit that position midway through the season, citing payment and player safety problems.

He was a representative in the state of California Legislature, and a Freemason, having served as Worshipfull Master of the lodge he belonged to until 1860. Early life and career Ellis was born in Jay, Maine. He moved to Felicity, Ohio, in 1838, where he was a lawyer and a school teacher. He married Harriet Ortus on October 25, 1842. Harriet and Ellis had three daughters, who all died during childhood. However, Harriet died soon after the birth of their third child in February 1845. On August 2, 1845, Ellis married one of his former students, Lucy Ann Dobbyns. While in Felicity, he served as both the Clerk to the Trustees and later, the School Examiner, for Franklin Township. Ellis joined the California gold rush and he went to Nevada City, California, and tried to set up shop as a retail salesman, a prospector and lawyer. In 1851 he was elected to the California State Assembly, where one of the resolutions he sponsored granted women the right to own property in the state of California. Ellis returned to Felicity, where in 1852, he and Lucy had the first of their children, Clara Blanche Ellis Starr, who would go on in her own right as a social leader of the city of Rockford, Illinois. While living in California, he met two businessmen from Rockford, Charles Spafford and Dr. D.G. Clark, who invited him to move to that city. Ellis did not move to Rockford until 1854 (or 55), where he would establish himself as a lawyer. His home was on West State between Avon & Tay Streets in West Rockford. Ellis joined Spafford, Charles Church and Clark in establishing a bank, the Spafford, Clark and Ellis Banking and Exchange Company, while he practiced law while in Rockford. He was instrumental in establishing the first fire department in Rockford in 1855, where he was named the first chief engineer. Civil War Ellis was involved with several local Rockford militia and cadet corps, including the one that organized by Col. Elmer Ellsworth, considered the first person killed in the American Civil War. Ellsworth was a personal friend of future President Abraham Lincoln and founder of the Zouave Movement, popular during and before the Civil War. Ellis became the company commander of the 'Ellis Rifles', Company C, 15th Illinois Infantry before being elected a lieutenant colonel and later the commander of that regiment. Ellis volunteered for duty and was mustered in the 15th Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Division of the Army of the Tennessee, in Freeport, Illinois. The 15th Regiment saw action at Fort Donelson near Clarksville, Tennessee, before action during the Battle of Shiloh. On April 6, 1862, while in the Hornet's Nest, having been promoted to the rank of acting colonel, Ellis was struck multiple times by enemy fire, but he continued to direct his troops until a fatal bullet hit him. After the battle, his body was recovered from the battlefield and his remains were shipped to Rockford for burial. After an elaborate funeral service, Ellis was buried in the family plot that he had bought only a few years earlier after the death of one of his daughters. Memorialization Ellis was a longtime member of Freemasonry, having been a member of Felicity Lodge #102, Orion Chapter #42 Royal Arch Masons, Connell Council #18 Royal & Select Masons, Lafayette Lodge F. & A.M. (in Nevada, California, part of the Grand Lodge of Wisconsin), Nevada Lodge #13 F. & A.M., and a founding member of the Star of the East Lodge #166 A.F. & A.M., which is still in existence. The E.F.W. Ellis Lodge #633 is named in tribute to Ellis and meets in the same building as the Star of the East Lodge. The Ellis Arts Academy, an elementary school within the Rockford School District, is named after him. There has been a public elementary school building named after Ellis since the first one named for him in 1868 and that first Ellis School building still exists, formerly the nucleus of the (St Thomas) Bishop Muldoon Catholic High School and now part of the west side location of the Crusader's Clinic healthcare organization. The area around the school is commonly known informally as Ellis Park. Also Ellis Street in San Francisco, California, is also named for Ellis as well as one in the city of Rockford. The Ellis family plot is directly adjacent to the NorthMain Street side of the Greenwood Cemetery offices. His weather worn gravestone is inscribed: \\"Ellis, Edward F.W., Lieutenant Colonel in the 15th Regiment Ill Vol, Killed in Action during the battle of Shiloh\\". His wife Lucy is buried next to him with other members of his family in the plot. His uniform and sword were on display at the Winnebago County War Memorial building in downtown Rockford, across the street from the Main Library, for several years. However, these items are not currently on display because the location of these items is not known.

The Court found that Mattel Inc. could not enforce the use of their trade-marked name \\"BARBIE\\" against a restaurant named \\"Barbie's\\". Background Barbie's restaurant, a Montreal chain of \\"bar-and-grill\\" type restaurants catering primarily to adults, applied to register the trade-mark \\"Barbie‚Äôs\\" and an associated design with respect to \\"restaurant services, take-out services, catering and banquet services.\\"Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 11. Mattel Inc. owns the \\"Barbie\\" trade-mark, and has a worldwide reputation for Barbie dolls and accessories targeted primarily at girls aged 3 to 11 years old.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 13. Mattel Inc. opposed the application to register \\"Barbie‚Äôs\\" restaurant on the basis that it would cause confusion in the marketplace. The applicant had the burden of satisfying the Trade-marks Opposition Board of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office that if \\"Barbie‚Äôs\\" restaurant and Mattel's \\"Barbie\\" were used in the same geographic area there would be no confusion in the marketplace. The Trade-marks Opposition Board rejected Mattel's opposition and allowed the registration, finding that the applicant's trade-mark, \\"Barbie‚Äôs\\", was not likely to be confused with Mattel's Barbie trade-mark.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 17. The Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal both upheld the Trade-marks Opposition Board's decision. Mattel Inc. appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Lower Court Rulings =Trade- Marks Opposition Board= The Board found that there was not a strong likelihood of consumer confusion. The Board based its decision on the fact that Mattel presented no evidence of actual confusion (although it was not required to), the mark had a low degree of inherent distinctiveness (as it is a short form of the name \\"Barbara\\"), and the nature of the uses by the two parties were very different. =Federal Court= Mattel appealed the Board's ruling to the Federal Court. The Federal Court decided that the trade-mark, \\"Barbie\\" by Mattel is not iconic enough to cause consumer confusion. Instead, it found that all factors must be considered, including that of the nature of the wares. The judge found the wares to be quite different, and as a result dismissed the appeal. =Federal Court of Appeal= Mattel appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal found no error by the Federal Court, and dismissed the appeal. Specifically, it found that the Federal Court judge was correct to reject a survey that showed merely a possibility of confusion and not the likelihood of confusion. Supreme Court Ruling Binnie, J. wrote the opinion to which seven other justices joined. LeBel, J. wrote a concurring opinion. =Issue= The issue addressed was whether Mattel Inc., owner of the Barbie trade-mark, could prevent a small chain of Montreal- based restaurants from registering the name \\"Barbie‚Äôs\\" with the Trademark Office, based on the likelihood of confusion in the marketplace between the two names. =Holding= The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the decision of the Trade-marks Opposition Board, that the use of the \\"Barbie\\" name for the Montreal-based restaurant would not likely create confusion in the marketplace with Mattel Inc.‚Äôs Barbie trade-mark, and allowed its registration. =Reasons of the Court= Binnie held that the standard of review applicable to the Trade-marks Opposition Board‚Äôs decision was reasonableness, based on the test set out in 'Dr. Q v College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia' [2003] 1 SCR 226. Section 6(2) of the Trade-marks Act states that trade-mark confusion occurs if using two trade-marks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the goods or services associated with those trade- marks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or services are of the same general class.RSC 1985, c T-13. To determine whether \\"Barbie‚Äôs\\" restaurant led to confusion in the marketplace with Mattel's \\"Barbie\\" trade-mark, Binnie considered the five factors set out in Section 6(5) of the Trade-marks Act. Depending on the surrounding circumstances of each case, the different factors may be weighted differently.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 70 Binnie clarified that the appropriate perspective in which to weigh these five factors is that of an \\"ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry.\\"Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 58. Binnie held that the applicant had shown on a balance of probabilities that confusion was not likely to occur in the marketplace between \\"Barbie‚Äôs\\" restaurant and Mattel's \\"Barbie\\" dolls. Determining trademark confusion Binnie held that the word \\"Barbie\\", while an everyday expression commonly used as the short-form of the name \\"Barbara\\", had acquired a strong secondary meaning associated with Mattel's Barbie dolls, and was therefore considerably distinct.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 75. In contrast, the mark applied for by \\"Barbie's\\" restaurant was only somewhat known in the surrounding area of Montreal. Since Mattel's trade-mark has been widely publicized since the early 1960s, while \\"Barbie's\\" restaurant has only existed since 1992, Binnie determined that Mattel's trade-mark had deeper roots.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 77. Binnie found that the doll business attracts different clientele with different tastes than the restaurant business. Binnie determined that it was difficult to see the basis on which consumers would arrive at the mistaken inference that Barbie's restaurants were associated with Mattel's Barbie dolls and accessories.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 83. Binnie held that \\"the parties operate in different and distinct channels of trade within which their respective wares and services do not intermingle.\\"Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 86. Binnie found that although both marks use the name \\"Barbie\\", \\"Barbie's\\" restaurant uses the name alongside a design. Binnie determined that when Mattel's packaging and advertising of Barbie is considered, there is considerable resemblance to the mark for \\"Barbie's\\" restaurant.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 88.  Other Surrounding Circumstances  Binnie stated that lack of any evidence of actual confusion is another circumstance that can be taken into account, while the intention, or mens rea, of the creators of \\"Barbie‚Äôs\\" restaurant is irrelevant.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 90.  Famous Brands  Though Binnie recognized that some marks become so famous that their use with any wares or services may be infringement, he found that \\"Barbie\\" did not hold such a strong mark.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 63. However, in determining how broad the scope of the trade-mark protection should be, Binnie stressed the importance of courts considering the totality of the circumstances.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 64.  Resemblance  Resemblance between trade- marks is not required to prove trade-mark confusion in the marketplace.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 at para 65. Confusion may arise even when trade-marks are related to products or services in different classes of the marketplace.Mattel, Inc. v 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22 .

The spelling of the name as 'Babalon' was revealed to Crowley in The Vision and the Voice. Her name and imagery feature prominently in Crowley's Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni. In her most abstract form, Babalon represents the female sexual impulse and the liberated woman. In the creed of the Gnostic Mass she is also identified with Mother Earth, in her most fertile sense. Along with her status as an archetype or goddess, Crowley believed that Babalon had an earthly aspect or avatar; a living woman who occupied the spiritual office of the 'Scarlet Woman'. This office, first identified in The Book of the Law is usually described as a counterpart to his own identification as \\"To Mega Therion\\" (The Great Beast). The r√¥le of the Scarlet Woman was to help manifest the energies of the Aeon of Horus. Crowley believed that several women in his life occupied the office of Scarlet Woman, for which see the list below. Babalon's consort is Chaos, called the \\"Father of Life\\" in the Gnostic Mass, being the male form of the Creative Principle. Chaos appears in The Vision and the Voice and later in Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni. Separate from her relationship with her consort, Babalon is usually depicted as riding the Beast. She is often referred to as a sacred whore, and her primary symbol is the Chalice or Graal. As Crowley wrote in his The Book of Thoth, \\"she rides astride the Beast; in her left hand she holds the reins, representing the passion which unites them. In her right she holds aloft the cup, the Holy Grail aflame with love and death. In this cup are mingled the elements of the sacrament of the Aeon\\". Three aspects Babalon is a complex figure, although, within one particular view of Thelemic literature, she is said to have three essential aspects: she is the Gateway to the City of the Pyramids, the Scarlet Woman and the Great Mother. =Gateway to the City of Pyramids= Within the mystical system of the A‚à¥A‚à¥, after the adept has attained the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel, he then might reach the next and last great milestone ‚Äî the crossing of the Abyss, that great spiritual wilderness of nothingness and dissolution. Choronzon is the dweller there, and its job is to trap the traveler in his meaningless world of illusion. However, Babalon is just on the other side, beckoning. If the adept gives himself totally to her ‚Äî the symbol of this act being the pouring of the adept‚Äôs blood into her graal ‚Äî he becomes impregnated in her, then to be reborn as a Master of the Temple and a saint that dwells in the City of the Pyramids. From Crowley's book Magick Without Tears: and from The Vision and the Voice (12th Aethyr): She is considered to be a sacred whore because she denies no one, and yet she extracts a great price ‚Äî the very blood of the adept and their ego-identity as an earthly individual. This aspect of Babalon is described further from the 12th Aethyr: The concept contained within this aspect of Babalon is that of the mystical ideal, the quest to become One with All through the annihilation of the earthly ego (\\"For as thy blood is mingled in the cup of BABALON, so is thine heart the universal heart.\\"). The blood spilling into the graal of Babalon is then used by her to \\"flood the world with Life and Beauty\\" (meaning to create Masters of the Temple that are \\"released\\" back into the world of men), symbolized by the Crimson Rose of 49 Petals.The Vision & the Voice, 1998, p.54, 61, 131 In sex magic, the mixture of female sexual fluids and semen produced in the sexual act with the Scarlet Woman or Babalon is called the Elixir of Life. Another alternative form of this Elixir is the Elixir Rubeus consisting of the menstrual blood and semen (abbreviated as El. Rub. by Crowley in his magical diaries), and is referred to as the \\"effluvium of Babalon, the Scarlet Woman, which is the menstruum of the lunar current\\" by Kenneth Grant.Grant, Kenneth. Nightside of Eden. London: Frederick Muller Limited. =Babalon's Daughter= One of the most extensive descriptions by Crowley of Babalon's Daughter is to be found in The Vision and the Voice, 9th Aethyr, quoted in The Book of Thoth: =Office of the Scarlet Woman= \\"This is Babalon, the true mistress of The Beast; of Her, all his mistresses on lower planes are but avatars,\\" said Crowley in The Vision and the Voice.The Vision and the Voice 1998, p.129 Although Crowley often wrote that Babalon and the Scarlet Woman are one, there are also many instances where the Scarlet Woman is seen more as a representative or physical manifestation of the universal feminine principle. In a footnote to Liber Reguli, Crowley mentions that of the ‚ÄúGods of the Aeon,‚Äù the Scarlet Woman and the Beast are ‚Äúthe earthly emissaries of those Gods.‚Äù . He then writes in The Law is for All: Individual scarlet women Aleister Crowley believed that many of his lovers and magical companions were playing a cosmic role, even to the point of fulfilling prophecy. The following is a list of women that he considered to have been (or might have been) scarlet women (quotes are from The Law is for All): *Rose Edith Crowley, Crowley's first wife. ‚ÄîPut me in touch with Aiwas; see Equinox 1, 7, \\"The Temple of Solomon the King.\\" Failed as elsewhere is on record. *Mary d'Este Sturges ‚ÄîPut me in touch with Abuldiz; hence helped with Book 4. Failed from personal jealousies. *Jeanne Robert Foster ‚ÄîBore the \\"child\\" to whom this Book refers later. Failed from respectability. *Roddie Minor ‚ÄîBrought me in touch with Amalantrah. Failed from indifference to the Work. *Marie Rohling ‚ÄîHelped to inspire Liber CXI. Failed from indecision. *Bertha Almira Prykrl ‚ÄîDelayed assumption of duties, hence made way for No. 7. *Leah Hirsig ‚ÄîAssisted me in actual initiation; still at my side, An XVII, Sol in Sagittarius. =Great Mother= Within the Gnostic Mass, Babalon is mentioned in the Gnostic Creed: Here, Babalon is identified with Binah on the Tree of Life, the sphere that represents the Great Sea and such mother-goddesses as Isis, Bhavani, and Ma'at. Moreover, she represents all physical mothers. Bishops T. Apiryon and Helena write: Origins =Whore of Babylon= Whore of Babylon. Painted by Gnostic Saint William Blake in 1809. The Whore of Babylon is referred to in several places in the Book of Revelation, a book which may have had an influence on Thelema, as Aleister Crowley says he read it as a child and imagined himself as the Beast. She is described in Chapter 17:3-6: Aleister Crowley recorded his view of the Book of Revelation in The Vision and the Voice. Enochian magic Another source is from the system of Enochian magic created by Dr. John Dee and Sir Edward Kelley in the 16th century. This system is based upon a unique language, Enochian, two words of which are certainly relevant. The first is BABALOND, which is translated as harlot. The other is BABALON, which means wicked. Some flavour of context in which they appear in can be found in a communication received by Dee & Kelley in 1587: See also * Inanna * Babalon Working Notes References *Crowley, Aleister (1995), The Book of Lies.

He served as manager of the California Angels (1977‚Äì78) and Cleveland Indians (1979‚Äì82). Including three games as acting manager of the 1975 Indians, during his first coaching tenure there, he compiled a career record of 310 wins and 311 defeats (.499). Career Garcia was born in East St. Louis, Illinois, to Spanish immigrant parents and entered the game in 1939. Derailed by injury as a player, Garcia was a minor league infielder for almost 20 seasons ‚Äî much of that time in the farm system of the New York Giants ‚Äî and never made it to the major leagues. His playing career also was interrupted by three years (1943‚Äì45) of service in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, and much of his later active career was spent as a player-manager in the low minor leagues. As the playing skipper of the 1951 Oshkosh Giants of the Class D Wisconsin State League, Garcia won the league's triple crown, with 23 home runs, 127 runs batted in and a batting average of .369. He threw and batted right-handed was listed as tall and . He began managing at age 27 in 1948 with the Giants' Knoxville Smokies farm team of the Class B Tri-State League, and would continue to manage in the New York and San Francisco Giants' minor league organization over the next two decades (1949‚Äì55; 1957; 1964; 1967‚Äì68). He also coached for Triple-A Minneapolis (1956) and scouted for the Giants (1957‚Äì63; 1965‚Äì66). Garcia then joined the San Diego Padres as a minor league manager in 1969, their maiden National League season. The following season, in his 50th year, Garcia finally reached the majors as San Diego's third-base coach. He coached with the Padres (1970‚Äì73), Indians (1975‚Äì76; 1979) and Angels (1977) and in 1977 he was named manager of the Angels when Norm Sherry was fired on July 11. While the Angels continued to stumble under him in 1977 (with a 35‚Äì46 record), the Halos stood at 25‚Äì20 when Garcia was released in favor of Jim Fregosi on June 1, 1978. Garcia got another chance to manage with the Cleveland Indians when Jeff Torborg was fired on July 23, 1979. Cleveland played at a 38‚Äì28 clip under Garcia for the remainder of the season, and compiled a mark of 52‚Äì51 during the strike-shortened 1981 campaign, but they never finished higher than fifth in the American League East. After a sixth-place finish in 1982, Garcia was fired. But he remained in the game into his mid 80s, as a coach for the Milwaukee Brewers (1983‚Äì84), a special assignment scout for the Brewers and Kansas City Royals, and ‚Äî from 2000‚Äì02 ‚Äî a coach with the Colorado Rockies. Garcia was named to the Rockies' staff when he was 79 years of age by then- skipper Buddy Bell.retrosheet.org He also scouted for other MLB teams, including the Seattle Mariners and Chicago Cubs. As a minor league manager in the Giants, Padres and Angels organizations, Garcia won 889 games and lost 796 (.528) and won three championships. He is one of only four individuals to play, coach or announce professional baseball during part of eight decades. (Vin Scully, Tommy Lasorda and Don Zimmer being the other three.) Personal life Garcia's son David was the Yankees first-round pick‚Äîthe 11th player taken overall‚Äîin the secondary phase of the January 1978 draft. He spent two years in the Yankee systems. Garcia also had two grandsons play professional baseball. Drew Garcia was a 21st round draft choice of the Chicago White Sox in 2008, and reached the Triple-A level. In 2010, the St. Louis Cardinals selected his grandson, Greg Garcia in the seventh round of Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut for the Cardinals in April 2014. Dave Garcia died in San Diego, his permanent home since 1961, of natural causes at the age of 97.

It is the designated US affiliate of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the United States movement to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The organization offers services and development programs.  History and organization  = Founders = The American Red Cross National Headquarters in Washington, D.C. is a National Historic Landmark. Clara Barton established American Red Cross in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 1881. She became its first president. Barton organized a meeting on May 12 of that year at the house of Senator Omar D. Conger (R, MI).The Federal Charter of the American Red Cross , American Red Cross. Retrieved April 18, 2007 Fifteen people were at the meeting, including Barton, Conger and Representative William Lawrence (R, OH) (who became the first vice president).McCormick, K. Todd A Brief History of Logan County, Ohio , Logan County Museum. Retrieved April 18, 2007 The first local chapter was established in 1881 at the English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Dansville. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Jane Delano (1862‚Äì1919) founded the American Red Cross Nursing Service on January 20, 1910.  Clara Barton  Barton founded the American chapter after learning of the Red Cross in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1869, she went to Europe and became involved in the work of the International Red Cross during the Franco-Prussian War. She was determined to bring the organization to America. Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross Barton became President of the American branch of the society, known as the American National Red Cross in May 1881 in Washington. The first chapters opened in upstate New York, where she had connections. John D. Rockefeller and four others donated money to help create a national headquarters near the White House. The abolitionist Frederick Douglass, a friend of Barton's, offered advice and support as she sought to establish the American chapter of Red Cross. As Register of Deeds for the District of Columbia, Douglass also signed the American Red Cross's original Articles of Incorporation. American Red Cross Administrative Headquarters in Washington, D.C. American National Red Cross Barton led one of the group's first major relief efforts, a response to the 1881 Thumb Fire in Michigan's Thumb region. Over 5,000 people were left homeless. The next major disaster was the Johnstown Flood on May 31, 1889. Over 2,209 people died and thousands more were injured in or near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in one of the worst disasters in U.S. history.  Progressive reform  Barton was unable to build up a staff she trusted and her fundraising was lackluster. She was forced out in 1904. Professional social work experts took control and made the group a model of Progressive Era scientific reform. New leader Mabel Thorp Boardman consulted with senior government officials, military officers, social workers, and financiers. William Howard Taft was especially influential. They imposed an ethos of \\"managerialism\\", transforming the agency from Barton's cult of personality to an \\"organizational humanitarianism\\" ready for expansion. Among the notable disasters of the Progressive Era that featured American Red Cross involvement was the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. The New York City chapter joined with the Charity Organization Society to provide funds to survivors and the dependents of those who perished. = Board of Governors Chairpersons = * William K.

Members of the board of governors other than the chairman are elected at the annual meeting of chapter delegates. The board appoints the chief executive officer. = Ranking = As of November 2017, the American Red Cross scores three out of four stars at Charity Navigator and B+ at CharityWatch. In 1996, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry magazine, released the results of the largest study of charitable and nonprofit organization popularity and credibility. The study showed that ARC was ranked as the third \\"most popular charity/non-profit in America\\" of over 100 charities researched, with 48% of Americans over age 12 choosing \\"Love\\" or \\"Like A lot\\" to describe it.\\"The Charities Americans Like Most And Least,\\" The Chronicle of Philanthropy, December 13, 1996, = Notable members =  Blood services  = Blood donation = ARC supplies roughly 35% of the donated blood in the United States, which it sells to hospitals and regional suppliers. Community-based blood centers supply nearly 60% and approximately 5% is collected directly by hospitals. In December 2004, ARC completed its largest blood processing facility in the United States in Pomona, California, on the campus grounds of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. = Tissue services = For more than 50 years, ARC provided allograft tissue for transplant through sales in its Tissue Services Program. It cared for thousands of donor families who donated tissue and sold the tissue to more than 1 million transplant recipients. At the end of January 2005, ARC ended its Tissue Services program to focus on its primary missions of Disaster Relief and Blood Services. = Plasma services = A leader in the plasma industry, ARC provides more than one quarter of the nation's plasma products. Red Cross Plasma Services provides plasma products that are reliable, cost- effective and as safe as possible. In February 1999, ARC completed its \\"Transformation\\", a $287 million program that reengineered Red Cross Blood Services' processing, testing, and distribution system and established a new management structure. As of 2011, ARC was no longer in the Plasma Services industry. It supplies Baxter BioSciences with items for manufacturing plasma products. = Nucleic acid testing = On March 1, 1999, ARC became the first U.S. blood bank to implement a Nucleic acid testing (NAT) study. This process is different from traditional testing because it looks for the genetic material of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV), rather than the body's response to the disease. The NAT tests for HIV and HCV has been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These tests detect the genetic material of a transfusion-transmitted virus like HIV without waiting for the body to form antibodies, potentially offering an important time advantage over current techniques. = Leukoreduction = Leukocytes (white blood cells) help fight off foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, and abnormal cells. In fact, these foreign leukocytes in transfused red blood cells and platelets are often not well tolerated and have been associated with some types of transfusion complications. Leukocytes in stored blood products can have a variety of biological effects, including depression of immune function, which can result in organ failure and death. Because whole blood is rarely used for transfusion and not kept in routine inventory, leukoreduced red blood supplies are critical. After collection, the whole blood is separated into red cells and plasma by centrifugation. A preservative solution is mixed with the red cells and the component is filtered with a leukoreduction filter. The shelf life of this product is 42 days. ARC is moving toward system-wide universal prestorage leukocyte reduction to improve patient care. From 1976 to 1985, the FDA received reports of 355 fatalities associated with transfusion, 99 of which were excluded from further review because they were unrelated to transfusion or involved hepatitis or HIV/AIDS. While the FDA has not yet made leukoreduction a requirement, ARC took a leading role in implementing this procedure with a goal of leukoreducing all blood products. More than 70% of ARC red blood cell components undergo prestorage leukoreduction, a filtering process performed soon after blood is donated. = Research = ARC operates the Jerome H. Holland blood laboratory in Rockville, Maryland. Each year, it invests more than $25 million in research activities at the Holland Laboratory and in the field. = Cellular therapies = ARC offers cellular therapies; this treatment involves collecting and treating blood cells from a patient or other blood donor. The treated cells are introduced into a patient to help revive normal cell function, replace cells that are lost as a result of disease, accidents or aging, or to prevent illnesses from appearing.  Training Services  Training Services is one of the five divisions of the American Red Cross, responsible for providing health and safety training to the general public as well as the workforce. In fiscal year 2017 the American Red Cross trained 2.28 million people how to save lives through their First Aid, CPR or AED courses, water safety and caregiving programs. There are a wide variety of course offerings available: * Administering Emergency Oxygen * Advanced Life Support * Anaphylaxis and Epinephrine Auto-Injector * Asthma Inhaler Training * Babysitter's Training * Basic Life Support * Bloodborne Pathogens Training * California Child Care * CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers * Emergency Medical Response * First Aid/CPR/AED (English and Spanish) * Hands-Only CPR * Learn to Swim * Lifeguard Management * Lifeguarding * Longfellow's WHALE Tales * Nurse Assistant Training * Pediatric Advanced Life Support * Responding to Emergencies * Safety Training for Swim Coaches * Title 22 (California First Aid for Public Safety Personnel) * Water Safety * Wilderness and Remote First Aid In addition to basic level certifications in the above courses the American Red Cross also offers Instructor level courses and Instructor Trainer (IT) level courses. Instructor level courses are designed to teach participants how to become instructors for American Red Cross courses, whereas Instructor Trainer courses (also known as Instructor Trainer Academies) are designed to certify current instructors to become Instructor Trainers, or people who can teach Instructor level courses. Training Services has an online store where you can purchase supplies including First Aid Kits, CPR keychains, flashlights, and emergency radios. = 2018 Manikin Change = In early 2018 all courses offered by the American Red Cross switched to BigRed manikin. The investment cost $1.8M and increased participants' understanding of the purpose of compressions during CPR. = Course Offerings = There are three entities that can run American Red Cross courses; The American Red Cross, Authorized Providers, and Licensed Training Providers. The American Red Cross runs many of its own courses that can be conducted on land such as First Aid/CPR/AED and Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers. There are a number of courses that require aquatic facilities to run, such as Lifeguarding and Water Safety Instructor. These courses are generally left to Authorized Providers (colleges, government agencies, fire departments, community centers) and to Licensed Training Providers (LLC. or Inc.). = Scientific Advisory Council = The Scientific Advisory Council is a panel including over 50 nationally recognized medical, scientific, aquatics, and academic experts from across the United States.  Disasters service American Red Cross providing assistance during the 1994 Northridge earthquake An American Red Cross vehicle distributing food to Grand Forks, North Dakota victims of the 1997 Red River flood Satellite communications after tropical storm Debby in Lake City, Florida, 2012 Each year, ARC responds to more than 60,000 disasters, including house or apartment fires (making up the majority), hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hazardous materials spills, transportation accidents, explosions and other natural and man-made disasters. Although ARC is not a government agency, its authority to provide disaster relief was formalized when, in 1905, it was granted a congressional charter to \\"carry on a system of national and international relief in time of peace and apply the same in mitigating the sufferings caused by pestilence, famine, fire, floods, and other great national calamities, and to devise and carry on measures for preventing the same.\\" The charter is not only a grant of power but also an imposition of duties and obligations to the nation, to disaster victims and to the people who support its work with their donations. Disaster relief focuses on emergency disaster-caused needs. When a disaster threatens or strikes, ARC provides shelter, food and health and mental health services (Psychological First Aid) to address basic human needs. The core of American Red Cross disaster relief is assistance to individuals and families to enable them to resume their normal daily activities. The organization provides translation and interpretation when necessary, and maintains a database of multilingual volunteers. At the local level, ARC chapters operate volunteer-staffed Disaster Action Teams. ARC feeds emergency workers of other agencies, handles inquiries from concerned family members outside the disaster area, provides blood and blood products to disaster victims and helps those affected by a disaster to access other resources. It is a member of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) and works closely with other agencies such as Salvation Army and Amateur Radio Emergency Service with whom it has memorandums of understanding. ARC works to encourage preparedness by providing important literature on readiness. Many chapters also offer free classes to the general public. A major misconception among the general public is that ARC provides medical facilities, engages in search and rescue operations or deploys ambulances. Instead, first responder roles are left to government agencies as dictated by the National Response Framework. Red Cross societies outside the U.S. may provide such functions; for example, the Cruz Roja Mexicana (Mexican Red Cross) runs a national ambulance service. Furthermore, American Red Cross Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) look similar to ambulances. These ERVs instead are designed for bulk distribution of relief supplies, such as meals, drinks and other relief supplies. Although ARC shelters usually assign a nurse to the facility, they are not equipped to provide medical care beyond first aid. = Disaster Services Workforce = The Disaster Services Workforce (DSW) system enrolls volunteers from ARC chapters into a national database of responders, classified by their ability to serve in one or more activities within groups. Services include feeding and sheltering (\\"mass care\\") to warehousing, damage assessment, accounting, communications, public affairs and counseling. Responders complete training requirements specific to the services they want to offer, backgrounds, and first aid training. = National Response Framework = As a National Response Framework support agency, ARC shelters, feeds and provides other types of emergency relief to victims of disasters. ARC is a co-lead with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the mass care portion of Emergency Support Function 6. ARC and FEMA share responsibility for planning and coordinating mass care services with FEMA. ARC has responsibilities for other Emergency Support Functions, such as providing health and mental health services.  Disaster responses  = 1908 Messina Earthquake = In 1908 an Earthquake and Tsunami devastated the area surround the Strait of Messina. The American public donated nearly $1 million to the American Red Cross which was sent to Italy via the State Department, alongside $800,000 in public funds. The decision to use the State Department to distribute funds, rather than sending them directly to the Italian Red Cross, was indicative of the organization's shift away from the International Red Cross movement and towards US interests. This was the ARC's first major response to an international civilian disaster. Before 1908, the U.S. congress had only rarely allocated funds for natural disasters, likewise, the level of funding given to Italy was also unprecedented. The ARC's aid to Italy carried important diplomatic meaning for the U.S. due to the large number of Italian emigrants who left for the U.S. every year, and Italy's growing importance within Europe. ARC leaders viewed relief efforts in Italy as a way to demonstrate U.S. care for the nation. Alongside this, disaster relief was seen as a tool for social reform. A fundamental goal of the ARC's assistance was to address the perceived threat of pauperization within an area that a large proportion of U.S. immigrants came from. = Role in the United States Occupation of Nicaragua = As a response to the Nicaraguan resentment of the United States Occupation of Nicaragau, U.S. officials employed the use of humanitarian relief in attempt to improve relations. $10,000 dollars was given to the ARC by Philander Knox to provide relief in the form of blankets, clothing, and food to captured soldiers from Jos√© Santos Zelaya‚Äôs army. ARC leaders believed that humanitarian relief would be more effective in fostering goodwill and creating stability than any other action. In 1912 the State and War Department became concerned with increasing reports of hunger within the country. As a result, Knox asked the ARC to supply food for non-combatants as well. American forces worked with the ARC to open railroads to distribute humanitarian supplies to Managua, Granada, L√©on, and other key cities. Although the ARC was a non-governmental agency, its humanitarian efforts lined up with American foreign policy, becoming a useful diplomatic mechanism for softening the effects of American military intervention and securing its political interests. = Role in World War One = Prior to the United States entry into World War One, the American Red Cross was a neutral organization aiding both the allied and central powers. However, when the United States joined the allied powers, the American Red Cross aid to the central powers ended immediately. On May 10, 1917, President Wilson created the American Red Cross War Council to aid funding initiatives and direct the activities of the organization. Throughout the war the Council raised $400 million. The American Red Cross in the war was a quasi state organization, but it is best described as a Non Governmental Organizational as it was not officially part of the United States Government. The American Red Cross in the war focussed principally on overseas civilian aid and not domestic disaster relief. The American Red Cross spent \\"less than one million dollars on domestic disaster relief, in comparison to the $120 million devoted to relief overseas. The American Red Cross during the war provided food, employment, housing and medical assistance to millions of civilians displaced by the war. During the course of the war over one third of the population of the United States joined the organization and in 1917 and 1918 alone around $400 million was raised. Amongst its initiatives was the Pisa Village in Italy, a humanitarian housing project begun in 1918. The power of the American Red Cross was soon recognized by the Government which began to see \\"the value of overseas aid as a tool of statecraft\\". The American Red Cross was increasingly being used as an arm of the state to facilitate the realization of American foreign policy objects. Principally the American Red Cross enhanced America's image abroad while also disseminating American practices and values throughout Europe. It intervened in European health and welfare practices by introducing American methods. Moreover, after the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia President Wilson used the American Red Cross as a diplomacy tool to aid the White forces. Wilson believed that food was the \\"real thing\\" to combat Bolshevism and ordered the American Red Cross to distribute food and material relief to Bolshevik opponents in the Russian civil war. The American Red Cross, therefore, served the dual functions of assisting the realization of United States foreign policy objectives and promoting international humanitarianism. At the end of the war the League of Red Cross Societies was created. This international society of national Red Cross organizations was spearheaded by the United States and sought the \\"improvement of health, the prevention of disease, and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world.\\" = Interwar European Reconstruction = Unlike European relief organization, which had to invest much of their time in fund-raising efforts, the American Red Cross's collaboration with Herbert Hoover‚Äôs American Relief Administration had funding on a different scale and well as popular and governmental support at its disposal. With its membership of over 33 million Americans in 1918 (20% of the U.S. population) and its designation as the official U.S. organization for foreign relief by the Geneva Treaty and Congressional mandate, the ARC was neither wholly private nor an official governmental organization. This quasi- governmental support allowed the ARC to secure credibility and support that was unattainable for other relief organizations such as the YMCA or Knights of Columbus. The ARC‚Äôs private funding allowed for more flexibility than government organizations, its leaders chose to support U.S. foreign policy in many ways but also often pursued aims that differed from that of the military or political policymakers. Hundreds of ARC workers pursued permanent reform of Italian social politics, rather than emergency relief they founded nursing schools, developed child welfare projects and waged anti-tuberculosis crusades. In introducing these American ideas about public health and social welfare, the ARC acted as what historian Daniel T. Rodgers had referred to as ‚Äòbrokers of ideas‚Äô, who facilitated transatlantic exchange on the methods and philosophies of social reform. Work in the ARC allowed American citizens to contribute to transatlantic social reform discourse. ARC workers built upon and expanded the already existing Italian efforts for social reform. ARC reformers embraced a strategic cultural sensitivity as they attempted to work with Italians and help them to take control of their own social institutions. By presenting their reforms as mutual exchange rather than imposed change, ARC workers hoped Italians would willingly accept them. U.S. reformers in the ARC continued to believe in the necessity of American intervention in ‚Äòreforming‚Äô Italy. = Russian revolution = In July 1918 the ARC established a hospital at the entrance of Vladivostok harbor, and during the year 8 more hospitals. Vladivostok Refugee hospital was opened in early 1919 in former naval barracks and had up to 250 beds. The ARC provided drugs and medical supplies to Russian hospitals during the civil war. = 2005 hurricanes = Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the Houston Astrodome, following Hurricane Katrina. Forecasting a major disaster before the landfall of Hurricane Katrina, ARC enlisted 2,000 volunteers to be on a \\"stand by\\" deployment list. According to ARC, during and after hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, they opened 1,470 shelters and registered 3. 8 million overnight stays. 300,000 American Red Cross workers (82% unpaid) provided sheltering, casework, communication and assessment services throughout these events. In addition, 346,980 comfort kits (which contain hygiene essentials such as toothpaste, soap, washcloths and toys for children) and 205,360 cleanup kits (containing brooms, mops and bleach) were distributed. The organization served 68 million snacks and meals. Disaster Health services provided 596,810 contacts, and Disaster Mental Health services 826,590 contacts. Emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families, including 4 million people. Katrina was the first natural disaster in the United States that ARC utilized their \\"Safe and Well\\" family location website.A Year of Healing The American Red Cross, August 2006.

This was the worst air disaster in the United States since American Airlines Flight 587. Family and Friends reception centers were established near the arrival and departure airports and in Cincinnati, site of the Comair headquarters. Local chapters in Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky and California provided health and mental health services to family and friends not present in Lexington. Volunteers also staffed the local Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in Lexington, Kentucky. = 2007 tornadoes = ARC is set up in a community hard hit by the tornadoes, Florida, 2007  Florida  In response to the Central Florida Tornado of February 2007, ARC began a large scale disaster relief operation. At least seven shelters were opened. 40,000 pre-packaged meals were sent by ARC, and across the nation, almost 400 American Red Cross volunteers were deployed to assist with local relief efforts. The organization deployed more than 30 Emergency Response Vehicles for community food and supply distribution.Hackett, Alexandra. \\"Volunteers descend on Central Florida\\" , tampabays10.com. Retrieved April 18, 2007.  Kansas  ARC immediately responded to the May 2007 Tornado Outbreak in central Kansas by setting up emergency shelters for displaced residents and started the distribution of food, water and relief supplies. = Minneapolis bridge collapse = Following the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge, the Twin Cities Area Chapter responded with their Disaster Action Team to provide food, information and comfort. A family service center was set up, and mental health counselors deployed to numerous locations. and Donations contributed for this cause totaled US$138,368 and covered the cost of services but not $65,000 in unexpected expenses. Weather and the collapse placed 70% of Minnesota counties in federal primary or contiguous disaster areas during that August.Minnesota designated counties are found in three places: and and  International services  ARC, as part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and its nearly 100 million volunteers, educates and mobilizes communities to overcome life-threatening vulnerabilities. ARC International Services Department focuses on global health, disaster preparedness and response, Restoring Family Links and international humanitarian law dissemination. ARC is involved with international projects such as the measles Initiative, malaria programs in Africa, disaster response and relief efforts in response to the 2004 South Asia tsunami. = Disaster preparedness and response = ARC international disaster response and preparedness programs provide relief and development assistance to millions of people annually who suffer as a result of natural and human-made disasters. To respond quickly and effectively, ARC has pre-positioned emergency relief supplies in three warehouses managed by the International Federation in Dubai, Malaysia, and Panama that are used to respond to disasters. An Emergency Response Unit (ERU) is another method with which ARC responds to international emergencies. An ERU is made up of trained personnel and pre-packaged equipment that is crucial in responding to sudden, large-scale disasters and emergencies in remote locations. American Red Cross ERUs specialize in providing emergency relief supplies and IT and Telecommunications for American Red Cross response operations.  Flood Prevention in the Huai River Valley  In 1911, the ARC initiated its first international disaster-prevention project in the Huai River Valley. The ARC hired engineers to redirect the Huai River to prevent the yearly flooding that ruined crops and caused famine. Key engineer within the project, C.D. Jameson, recommended a financial commitment to drainage, flood prevention, and land reclamation which he promised would result in ‚Äòthe elimination of the suffering, starvation, and degeneration of several millions of people‚Äô, which would substantially reduce ‚Äòunrest and lawlessness‚Äô. The plan's ambition to re-engineer the Chinese landscape was representative of the increasingly global ambitions of the ARC and the new direction the organization was taking prior to World War I.  Haiti  On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake struck the Haitian coast 10 miles from the capital of Port-au-Prince, causing massive damage, more than 200,000 deaths and displacing nearly 2 million people. As of March 2011, ARC announced it had allocated $314 million for Haiti earthquake relief and recovery. ARC funded recovery projects to provide transitional homes, health services, disaster preparedness, water and sanitation improvements and livelihoods development. It provided funds for school fees for affected families. As of June 2011, ARC had raised approximately $484 million for Haiti relief and recovery efforts. A series of reports by NPR and ProPublica found that much of the money Americans donated never made it to help people in Haiti and promises to rebuild neighborhoods were never met. = Global health = ARC International Services global health initiatives focus on preventing and combating infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and measles on a large scale. Through cost- effective, community-based health interventions, ARC targets people in need and focuses on accessibility and equity of care, community participation, and integration with other community development initiatives, such as water and sanitation projects and food and nutrition programs. An example of ARC International Services health programming is the Measles Initiative, launched in 2001, as a partnership committed to reducing measles deaths globally. The initiative provides technical and financial support to governments and communities on vaccination campaigns and disease surveillance worldwide. Leading these efforts are ARC, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the World Health Organization. The Measles Initiative has supported vaccination campaigns in more than 60 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia. Since 2001, the initiative has helped vaccinate one billion children in more than 60 developing countries. The initiative supported the distribution of more than 37 million insecticide-treated mosquito nets for malaria prevention, 81 million doses of de-worming medicine, 95 million doses of polio vaccine, and 186 million doses of Vitamin A. In December 2006, ARC became a founding partner of the Malaria No More campaign. The campaign was formed by leading non-governmental organizations to inspire individuals, institutions, and organizations in the private sector to support a comprehensive approach to end malaria, a devastating but preventable disease. ARC supported local Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers in Africa who educated families and communities about malaria prevention and treatment, such as the proper and consistent use of insecticide-treated bed nets. ARC provided technical assistance and capacity- building support to its partners in difficult-to-reach communities. = International tracing requests = ARC handles international tracing requests and searches for families who have been separated. This service attempts to re-establish contact between separated family members. Restoring Family Links services provide the exchange of hand-written Red Cross Messages between individuals and their relatives who may be refugees or prisoners of war. At any given time, ARC Restoring Family Links program is handling the aftermath of 20‚Äì30 wars and conflicts. The worldwide structure of Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross make this service possible. When new information from former Soviet Union archives became available in the 1990s, a special unit was created to handle World War II and Holocaust tracing services. = International humanitarian law = ARC International Services educates the American public about the guiding principles of international humanitarian law (IHL) for conduct in warfare as set forth by the Geneva Conventions of 1949. In doing so, ARC International Services provides support to ARC chapters in their IHL dissemination efforts, offering courses and providing instructor training.  Service to the Armed Forces  A World War II-era poster encouraged American women to volunteer for the Red Cross as part of the war effort. ARC provides emergency and non-emergency services to the United States military. The most notable service is emergency family communications, where families can contact the Red Cross to send important family messages (such as a death in the family, or new birth). ARC can also act as a verifying agency. The agency operates call centers to provide these services. ARC works closely with other military societies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, to provide other services to service members and their families. ARC is not involved with prisoners of war; these are monitored by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the international body. Carney Airfield, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands Red Cross girl, August 1944 One criticism of American Red Cross services to the military stems from stories about ARC charging troops during the Second World War and Korean War token fees for \\"comfort items\\" such as toothpaste, coffee, donuts, and cigarettes and for off-base food and lodging. The fee suggestion had been made in a letter dated March 1942 from the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to Norman H. Davis, the chairman of ARC. The suggestion was that Allied soldiers were being charged money so Americans should be charged too so as to \\"ensure an equitable distribution among all service personnel of American Red Cross resources\\". The American Red Cross adopted the Secretary's suggestion as policy. During World War II, ARC operated the American Red Cross Clubmobile Service to provide servicemen with food, entertainment and \\"a connection home.\\" In a June 18, 1945, address to Congress, General Dwight D. Eisenhower said of the American Red Cross service in World War II, \\"The Red Cross, with its clubs for recreation, its coffee and doughnuts in the forward areas, its readiness to meet the needs of the well and to help minister to the wounded has often seemed the friendly hand of this nation, reaching across the sea to sustain its fighting men.\\" An account of one World War II American Red Cross Girl is recorded in Destination Unknown by Kathleen Cox; her mother, LeOna Cox, was recruited to American Red Cross Service by a fellow teacher at Allegheny College. Another account of an American Red Cross World War II worker is related in letters by Evelyn Merritt Welden, compiled in the book How to Play During a War: A Free Spirit's Life in Letters, by her son, Lynne Whelden.Great Lakes Naval Hospital 1966, Jennie and Terrie Frankel perform for wounded soldiers. During the Vietnam War 627 American women served in the ARC Supplemental Recreation Overseas Program. At the invitation of the United States Army the \\"Donut Dollies\\" provided morale- boosting games to soldiers. Due to the mobility of the UH-1 Iroquois, Vietnam Donut Dollies were able to visit troops in forwarding operating positions. The 2008 documentary film A Touch of Home: The Vietnam War's Red Cross Girls tells the story of these women. ARC also provided services to entertain wounded soldiers at the Great Lakes Naval Hospital during the Vietnam War. In 2011, the Service to the Armed Forces (SAF) unit was reorganized and began receiving $24 million per year from Congress for operating expenses. Along with being downsized there was a consolidation into four regional locations (San Diego, California, Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, Louisville, Kentucky, and Springfield, Massachusetts). In 2012 the first stories began breaking about long call times and the poor quality of response from call takers.http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2012/nov/13/military-call- hubs-now-handle-disasters-too/ along with questions about whether money was being used appropriately. In 2015, the San Diego and Springfield locations were closed because an online option for families was implemented.  Controversies  = Johnson & Johnson suit over Red Cross image = red cross flag. The American Red Cross flag logo. On August 7, 2007, Johnson & Johnson (J&J;) filed suit against ARC over its sublicensing of the International Red Cross image for the production of first aid kits and similar products, which it alleged competed with the company's products. The suit also asked for the destruction of all non-Johnson & Johnson Red Cross Emblem bearing products and demanded that ARC pay punitive damages and J&J;'s legal fees. The American Red Cross' position was that it had licensed its name to first aid kit makers in an effort to encourage readiness for disasters and that license revenues supported humanitarian work. J&J; claimed that the American Red Cross's commercial ventures were outside the scope of historically well-agreed usage and were in direct violation of federal statutes.Johnson & Johnson Press Release . Statement on Civil Complaint Against The American National Red Cross. August 9, 2007. On May 14, 2008, a federal judge ruled against J&J.; In June 2008, the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached allowing both parties to use the symbol.Claim Over Red Cross Symbol Is Settled , The New York Times, June 18, 2008. = Court ordered consent decree = The FDA took court action against ARC in response to deficiencies in their procedures for ensuring blood supply safety. The resulting consent decree outlines violations of federal law that ARC engaged in before 1993.Consent Decree Notification, U.S. Food and Drug Administration website, (April 13, 2003). Retrieved on April 18, 2007. ARC paid millions of dollars in fines. ARC Biomedical Services instituted a standardized computer system to maintain the blood donor database; five National Testing Laboratories (NTLs) that test some six million units of blood annually; the Charles Drew Biomedical Institute, which provides training and other educational resources to Red Cross Blood Services' personnel; a Quality Assurance/Regulatory Affairs Department, which helps to ensure regulatory compliance; and, a centrally managed blood inventory system. The Consent Decree was amended in 2003 with penalties for specific violations. The FDA could impose penalties after April 2003 up to the following maximum amounts: * $10,000 per event (and $10,000 per day) for any violation of an ARC standard operating procedure (SOP), the law, or consent decree requirement and timeline * $50,000 for the preventable release of each unit of blood for which the FDA finds a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences ** $5,000 for the release of each unit that may cause temporary problems, up to a maximum of $500,000 per event * $50,000 for the improper re-release of each unsuitable blood unit that was returned to ARC inventory * $10,000 for each donor inappropriately omitted from the National Donor Deferral Registry, a list of all unsuitable donors The FDA continued to apply pressure and fines to ARC in order to enforce compliance with regulations, including a $1.7 million fine in June 2008. ARC worked closely with the FDA to develop a more robust system. The systems resulted in a five- year period of sustained compliance that led to the release from the Consent Decree as of December 4, 2015.Red Cross Gets Blood Consent Decree Lifted , The Nonprofit Times website, (December 15, 2015). Retrieved on December 22, 2015. = Blood donation controversy = ARC faced criticism from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) advocacy organizations for prohibiting men who have sex with men (MSM) from donating blood. This policy was an FDA requirement for all blood collection companies and organizations in the United States. Specifically, the FDA instructs blood collection organizations to \\"defer for 12 months from the most recent sexual contact, a man who has had sex with another man during the past 12 months\\". Consequently, ARC was legally unable to collect blood from such men. In 2006, along with the AABB and America's Blood Centers, ARC petitioned the FDA to remove the requirement from blood donations, citing better screening technologies. As of December 2016, the American Red Cross reports on its website that its deferral of MSM from donating blood for 12 months after any sexual contact with another man is aligned with the guidance issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. = Hurricane Katrina controversy = In March 2006, investigations of allegations of fraud and theft by volunteers and contractors within ARC Katrina operations were launched by the Louisiana Attorney-General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\\"Red Cross probed on Katrina fraud\\" , BBC News Online, March 27, 2006. Retrieved April 18, 2007. In response, ARC increased its internal and external education of the organization's fraud and a waste hotline for confidential reporting to a third party agency. The organization also elected to implement a background check policy for all volunteers and staff, starting in 2006.Background Check Fact Sheet, PlainsRedCross.org, July 2006. In April 2006, an unnamed former ARC official leaked reports made by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the British Red Cross. Such reports are typical of a large-scale disaster relief operation involving other national Red Cross societies to solicit their input, but are usually confidential and not released to the general public. These particular reports were particularly critical of ARC operations in Katrina-affected regions, although the British Red Cross report strongly praised ARC volunteers for their efforts. = Storms controversy (Hurricane Sandy, Isaac, other major storms) = In October 2014, independent public interest news broadcasters NPR and ProPublica published investigative reports on the Red Cross's handling of US East Coast Hurricanes Sandy and Isaac, citing internal Red Cross documents and interviews with former Red Cross and government officials. It criticized the organization's response in failing to meet the immediate needs of victims.

Thus far, for all species of mammals investigated, the SDN has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females. In humans, the volume of the SDN has been found to be 2.2 times as large in males as in females and to contain 2.1 times as many cells. The human SDN is elongated in females and more spherical in males. No sex differences have been observed in the human SDN in either cell density or mean diameter of the cell nuclei. The volume and cell number of the human SDN considerably decreases with age, although the decrease in cell number is both sex and age-specific. In males, a substantial decrease in the cell number of the human SDN was observed between the age of 50‚Äì60 years. Cell death was more common in females than males, especially among those older than 70 years of age. The SDN cell number in females can drop to 10-15% of that found in early childhood. SDN and its homologues exist widely in human, mammal, and some other animal brains, including: * the third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3) in humans; * ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus (MPOA/AH) in sheep; * sexually dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic area (SDN-POA) in rats; * anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc) in macaques; * specific area in medial preoptic nucleus (POM) in quails; etc. Sexually dimorphic nucleus in medial preoptic area =Formation and organization of SDN in medial preoptic area=  Sex differences in SDN caused by exposure to testosterone (prenatal) The volume of SDN in medial preoptic area is modified by hormones, among which testosterone is proved to be of much importance. The larger volume of male SDN is correlated to the higher concentration of fetal testosterone level in males than in females. Also, there is evidence that testosterone acts during specific prenatal period to organize the development of aromatase-expressing neurons into the male-typical SDN (testosterone is transformed to estrogen by aromatase). The effect of testosterone is also shown by the influence of fetal intrauterine position on the morphology of SDN-POA. Studies demonstrated that male rats which were gestated between two male fetuses (2M) have 2-fold larger SDN-POA volumes than those gestated between two female fetuses (2F). At the same time, the testosterone levels, as well as the 17Œ≤-estradiol (product of testosterone) levels, were found to be significantly larger in 2M males than in 2F males on gestation day 21 (testosterone can be transferred from adjacent male fetuses to the target rats). However, evidence fails to show any relationship between SDN volume and female fetal position. Sex differences in the volume of SDN caused by apoptosis (postnatal) According to some studies, the volume difference of SDN between males and females is related to apoptosis during early development after birth. In rats, central division of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPNc) is an important component of SDN-POA and evidence showed that the number of apoptotic cells within MPNc is greater in females than in males between postnatal day (PD) 7 and PD10. In MPNc, the levels of some proteins, which are related to apoptosis, were shown to be of significant difference between males and females. Such proteins include Bcl-2 and Bax. Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein. The level of Bcl-2 in PD8 male rats is much higher than that in female rats of the same age, hence the number of apoptotic cells of MPNc in PD8 male rats is much lower than PD8 female rats. On the other hand, Bax, a proapoptotic protein, shows lower level in PD8 males than in PD8 females. Also, the number of active caspase-3-ir cells was observed to be greater in females than in males, indicating higher level of apoptosis in female MPNc. Apoptosis also occurs in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), which is also a sexually dimorphic area and is located in the periventricular gray area at the rostral extreme of the third ventricle. In contrast with SDN-POA, AVPV has larger size in females than in males. It is proved that Bcl-2 level in AVPV is higher whereas Bax level is lower in females than in males, just as being opposite of those in MPNc. As indicated in these two cases, apoptotic cell death plays a critical role in the formation of sexually dimorphic nucleus, and the apoptotic cell number within SDN negatively correlates with the volume of SDN between different sexes. =Role of SDN in controlling of male sexual behaviors= Male sexual behaviors can be divided into two phases: the appetitive phase, which contains highly variable sequence of behaviors such as attracting and courting, and the consummatory phase, during which highly stereotyped copulatory behaviors occur. The medial preoptic area of the brain is considered to control the expression of both male copulation and male appetitive sexual behavior. It is found that large lesions of SDN-POA severely disrupt copulatory behavior in rats. Also, cell-body lesions of SDA pars compacta (a homologue of SDN-POA) in gerbils produce severe disruptions of male copulatory behavior. Moreover, a study on medial preoptic nucleus (POM) (homologue of medial preoptic nucleus in rats) in quails showed that the activation of male copulatory behavior requires the aromatization of androgen (testosterone) into an estrogen (17Œ≤-estradiol). Like in SDN-POA, aromatase-expression neurons are a specific marker of the nuclear boundary of POM in quails. The intensity of male copulatory behavior is found to positively correlate with the number of the aromatase-expression neurons in the caudal part of POM. Appetitive behaviors are also partly controlled by medial preoptic area as aromatase-knockout mice show deficits in sexual motivation. However, appetitive behaviors are disrupted by the lesions in rostral part rather than caudal part of medial preoptic area. Lesions of the rostral part of medial preoptic area also diminish preference for female by male rats. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis experiments showed that the level of extracellular dopamine in the mPOA increases as the sexual appetitive sequences progress. mPOA‚Äôs involvement in the control of appetitive sexual behaviors is also confirmed by pharmacological manipulations of the dopaminergic system in it. In rats, lesions to mPOA can eliminate the male copulatory behavior but can only diminish appetitive behavior, which suggests that some other parts of the brain, except for mPOA, are also responsible for sexually appetitive behavior. =Role of SDN in sexual partner preference= Role of SDN in male partner preference Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep demonstrate that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) have been found to have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. Then series of brain sections, including hypothalamic, temporal lobe and diencephalon tissues, were imaged. Also, in situ hybridization was conducted to examine the level of the expression of cytochrome P450 aromatase in these brain sections. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. The number of neurons within oSDN is significantly greater in homosexual rams than in heterosexual rams, so it is with the mean length of the oSDN. But the neuron density is similar in both kinds of rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams. Other species have similar relationships between sexual preferences and the volume of SDN. For example, INAH3 in humans (homologue of oSDN) is significantly larger in heterosexual men than in homosexual men. Damage of SDN and changes in sexual partner preferences in males Bilateral damage to SDN in the medial preoptic area in male ferrets causes the change of males from male-typical preference to female-typical preference. Male ferrets which were sexually experienced and responded to female body odor, when treated by bilateral lesions to SDN, change to respond to male body odor. It is probable that SDN plays an important role in leading to mating and successful reproduction. Role of SDN in female partner preference Although SDN is much related to sexual partner preferences in males, it does not show the same relationship to partner preferences in females. Evidence shows that SDN in medial preoptic area is not the prerequisite for the expression of male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preferences in females. One piece of evidence comes from the study on female Japanese macaque, which routinely court, mount (with pelvic thrust), compete for, and even prefer certain female sexual partners over certain males. The part of the brain examined is the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc), a homologue of SDN-POA. Comparison of the AHdc nucleus volumes between Japanese macaque and rhesus macaque (a closely related sister species of Japanese macaque) shows that there is no significant difference between the volume of AHdc in more male-typical macaques and that in female-typical macaques. Role of SDN in Human Sexual Orientation In 1991, LeVay published a study of 41 autopsies on 16 heterosexual men, 19 homosexual men, and 6 heterosexual women that targeted the interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 1, 2, 3, and 4). He showed that there were no significant differences between the three groups' INAH 1, 2, and 4, which prior research already showed. However, INAH 3 was larger in heterosexual men in comparison to homosexual men and heterosexual women. This research linked an established sexually dimorphic area of the brain to hetero- and homosexual behavior in men. A later study determined that the size of the INAH3 of homosexual men was intermediate between that of heterosexual men and heterosexual women. It also determined that the reason why the INAH3 is smaller in homosexual versus heterosexual men is because homosexual men have a higher neuronal packing density (the number of neurons per cubic millimeter) in the INAH3 than heterosexual men; there is no difference in the number or cross-sectional area of neurons in the INAH3 of homosexual versus heterosexual men. It was also found that there is no effect of HIV infection on the size of INAH3, that is, HIV infection cannot account for the observed difference in INAH3 volume between homosexual and heterosexual men. These findings only partially corroborate LeVay's hypothesis that homosexual males have a \\"female- like hypothalamus\\" ‚Äî given that the INAH3 was smaller in homosexual men, intermediate in size between that of heterosexual males and heterosexual females. Furthermore, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of homosexual males is larger than the SCN of heterosexual men and women; both the volume and the number of neurons of the SCN are twice as many in homosexual males than in heterosexual males. These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. In sum, some contemporaries cast serious doubt over LeVay's hypothesis that homosexual males have a \\"female hypothalamus\\" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the \\"male brain from originally female brain\\" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.http://www.hiim.unizg.hr/images/knjiga/CNS41.pdf - Juda≈°, M., Kostoviƒá, I., The Fundamentals of Neuroscience, ch. 41, Neurobiology of emotions and sexuality, p. 408 (in Croatian) =Effects of proteins and other molecules on SDN in medial preoptic area= NELL2 NELL2 is a tissue- specific protein in the nervous system. It contains EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like repeat domain and its gene expression is regulated by estrogen. NELL2 is also known to play a neuroprotective role rat hippocampus neurons. When NELL2 synthesis is blocked by intracerebroventricular injection of antisense (AS) NELL2 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) into neonatal male rat brains (postnatal day0-day5), the size of SDN-POA is decreased. Since volume of SDN is related to the level of testosterone, it is quite possible that the volume is finally due to the neuroprotective effect of estradiol which is produced from testosterone by aromatase. So the result that NELL2 blockage reduces the size of SDN-POA suggests that it probably has neuroprotective effect on SDN- POA. Somatostatin The sex-specific transcription of somatostatin gene coincides with the establishment of sex differences in SDN-POA. It is observed that somatostatin mRNA appears in the SDN-POA of both males and females. On postnatal day 8 through postnatal day 35, the area of somatostatin mRNA- positive cells was significantly larger in males than in females, with males attain the maximum size of that area on day15 before decrease whereas females show no changes. Eventually the expression of somatostatin mRNA shows no difference between sexes. It is possible that somatostatin is related to the estrogen-dependent organization of SDN-POA. Fenitrothion Fenitrothion is a kind of organophosphate and it can affect the development of reproductive system of male rats. Treatment with fenitrothion to male rats causes regression of androgen-dependent organ weights because fenitrothion is a potent competitive androgen receptor antagonist. Its effect on SDN-POA is different between male rats and female rats. In male rats, prenatal exposure to fenitrothion causes significantly increase of the volume of SDN-POA; whereas, in female rats, prenatal exposure to fenitrothion causes significantly decrease of the volume of SDN-POA. One possible explanation is that fenitrothion can alter the activity of aromatase, which then alters the level of estrogens converted by it from androgens and finally alters the volume of SDN-POA. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen and was widely used for preventing threatened abortion. DES also has effect on development of the reproductive system. Low dose of DES exhibits inhibitory effect on plasma testosterone concentration in male rats while promotes follicular maturation in female rats. Experiments were done to see the effects of DES on SDN-POA volume. It is demonstrated that DES treatment altered the volume of SDN-POA in females by increasing it, resulting in larger volume SDN than in untreated females. However, a low dose of DES did not change the volume of the SDN-POA in male rats. Morphine Morphine can also alter the activities within the sexually dimorphic brain regions. Prenatal exposure to morphine increases copulatory behavior in male rats while decreases estrous behavior in female rats. Other sexually dimorphic areas in the brain Ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) has long been considered as a sexually dimorphic nucleus. It is an important region for regulating the sexual responses in female rodents. The neurons within VMN have significant estrogen-dependent functional and structural plasticity. The synaptic organization of the VMN is sexually dimorphic. Females have more dendrite chemical synapses within VMN while males have more somatic synapses within that region. In addition, the size of postsynaptic densities of axospinous and axosomatic synapses is sexually dimorphic, with males having larger density than females. Estrogen plays an important role in modulating the sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity of VMN. Estradiol levels are high on proestrus rats and return to low levels on diestrus rats. The volume of cell bodies within VMN in proestrus rats and male rats is larger than diestrus rats. Also, proestrus rats have significantly higher synapse density in VMN than diestrus rats. Moreover, Gamma-aminobutyric acid plays a role in VMN development such as sexual differentiation.

She first appeared in Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters #1 (August 1987), and was created by Mike Grell. Shado is notable for being an antagonist and a love interest to Green Arrow in DC comic books, and is distinguished from other recurring characters by being both his lover and the mother of his child. The character was later revised following DC's 2011 reboot, envisioning her as a former lover of Green Arrow's father, and the mother of his half-sister, Emiko. A reimagined version of Shado appeared as a recurring character on The CW show Arrow, played by Celina Jade. In this version, she is neither Oliver's rapist nor the mother of his sister, but his lover and first teacher as an archer whose death haunts him in his later career as Green Arrow. The actress also portrayed her twin sister Mei in the third season. Fictional character biography =The Longbow Hunters= Shado first appears in Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters in 1987. Her backstory tells that she is the daughter of a Yakuza agent sent to America with a large cache of gold, prior to World War II, in order to establish Yakuza operations in America. Being Japanese, Shado's father was placed in an internment camp when the war broke out. A group of American soldiers came to suspect his Yakuza ties but were unable to torture him into revealing the location of any money. Years after the war, the retired soldiers decided to try again. This was after Shado had been born, so the retired soldiers were able to threaten her and her mother. Not wishing to see his family harmed, Shado's father turned over the gold. Shado's mother died from wounds the soldiers had given her, and her father committed seppuku to atone for failing the Yakuza. His disgrace then fell upon his infant daughter, Shado, who was raised specifically to kill the Americans who had dishonored her Yakuza family. To that end she was extensively trained in martial arts and Ky≈´d≈ç, the Japanese art of archery. When Shado came of age, she left to America and began killing the Americans who had disgraced her. Two of the former soldiers had used the stolen gold to build a shipping business, as well as a drug trafficking operation. The string of murders she committed brought her to the attention of the Green Arrow, Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Queen. At first, the two were adversaries. However, Shado aided Ollie in killing the Seattle Slasher (a serial killer he had been tracking) and then assisted Oliver in rescuing his lover and partner Black Canary, who had been kidnapped and was being tortured by one of the Americans Shado was hunting. Seeing Black Canary being tortured, Green Arrow killed the man before Shado could. Shado would again work alongside Green Arrow when the drug-traffickers she was hunting made an alliance with CIA Agent Osborne. Shado would eventually kill all the former soldiers except the one Oliver had killed to save Black Canary.Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters =Later stories= One year after the events in The Longbow Hunters, Shado found herself back in Japan, facing the wrath of her Yakuza Oyabun (a Yakuza godfather). By failing to execute one of her targets, the man Green Arrow had killed, she had failed her mission. Her Oyabun decides that, in accordance with Yakuza tradition, she sever her thumb in atonement. Her Ku-Do Sensei, however, refused to allow his greatest student to destroy her skills, and drew a bow and arrow on the Oyabun. Once Shado escaped, the sensei allowed himself to be killed by the Oyabun. Shado, hearing the murder, returned and killed the Oyabun in turn, then fled to Hawaii. Green Arrow was then blackmailed by CIA Agent Osborne, who claimed that Shado had a treasure map, into tracking her down. No sooner did he find her, however, than she shot him in the chest with an arrow. Later she would claim to have mistaken him for an attacker. Shado helped nurse Oliver back to health from his injury. It was later revealed that during this time, while he was still delirious from pain and medications, Shado raped Oliver and conceived a son. Shado claimed not to be aware of Oliver's delirium until he called out Dinah's name. Once Green Arrow recovered from his injuries he aided Shado in defending herself from the Yakuza hunting her. However, the two are unable to prevent the death of her friend, Mr. Alvaro. After a bloody battle against a Yakuza death-squad, Green Arrow and Shado discover that the Yakuza had been following them using a tracking device in Oliver's quiver. Realizing that he had been used, Oliver arranged to meet Agent Osborne, telling him and two Japanese \\"agents\\" accompanying him that Shado had died. It was then revealed that Mr. Alvaro was the true \\"map\\"; he was the last survivor of a team of Filipinos that had buried their country's treasury to keep it from the Japanese, only telling Shado the location. It was then revealed that Osborne was working without the CIA's knowledge, with agents of a deposed Filipino dictator, who had recruited Yakuza muscle by promising a share of the gold, along with Shado's death. With Shado's help, Green Arrow is able to bring Osborne to justice and lead the FBI to his Yakuza allies. Shado and Green Arrow again parted ways. Several years later, Shado returned to Oliver with her child, Robert. She explained to Oliver that the child was his, and how the child had been conceived, but forbade him from taking a role in his son's life.Green Arrow #9-12 Shado next appears in the series Connor Hawke: The Dragon's Blood, in which a Chinese business man fascinated by ancient mythology holds an archery tournament and invites many skilled marksmen, including Green Arrow's son Connor Hawke and Shado.Connor Hawke: The Dragon's Blood Later, in Green Arrow/Black Canary, Shado manipulates a false League of Assassins group into shooting Connor with a specially designed bullet,Green Arrow/Black Canary #3 (February 2008) which reduces him to a vegetative state for Doctor Sivana so he can save her son, who is temporarily turned into a mindless drone by the doctor.Green Arrow/Black Canary #11-12 (October‚ÄìNovember 2008) =The New 52= In 2011, DC relaunched and revamped its properties as part of its The New 52 publishing event. Green Arrow was one of several titles to receive a substantial overhaul, jettisoning much of its old continuity and depicting the adventures of a younger and less experienced Oliver Queen. Shado first appears in Green Arrow #21 (2013), where she is discovered in Vlatlava by Oliver Queen, in the custody of Count Vertigo. She instantly recognizes Oliver by sight as Robert Queen's son. Oliver encounters her on a mission to find Robert Queen's killer, Komodo. She reveals to Oliver that she and his father were lovers and that together they had a daughter, Emiko, the young archer who travels at Komodo's side. In the conclusion of the \\"Broken\\" arc, Emiko later rejects Shado and Robert as parents, and chooses to be a pupil of Oliver's instead; she lives with Oliver and trains as his apprentice from thereon. However, in Green Arrow #1 (2016), following DC Rebirth, Emiko betrays Oliver by riddling him with arrows alongside her mother in an apparent assassination attempt. She later appears to show some guilt and apprehension about her mother's plans. In Secret Origins #3, a woman matching Shado's description is seen training Kate Kane, though it's not revealed if it is truly her.Secret Origins #3 (August 2014) =Rebirth= Shado re-appears in Green Arrow comics following DC Rebirth. Shado is a mercenary and member of the \\"Ninth Circle\\", an international criminal organization and bank alongside such assassins like Brick, Eddie Fyers and Cheshire. Green Arrow Vol. 6 #10 Powers and abilities Shado is an expert martial artist and a master of Kyudo, the Japanese art of archery. She uses a 30 kilogram bow and Japanese bamboo arrows 97.5 centimetres long. In other media =Television= Shado appears in the CW series, Arrow, played by Celina Jade. Whereas in the comic books Shado is Japanese, in the television series she is Chinese. She is portrayed as the daughter of Yao Fei, and is held captive on the island of Lian Yu by Edward Fyers, who uses her to force Yao Fei to take the blame for his crimes. In the adaptation, she remains a skilled martial artist and archer, and teaches Oliver Queen to use a bow and arrow. After helping Oliver and Slade Wilson defeat Fyers, she and Oliver develop a romantic relationship. She is also important in giving Oliver his morals on killing and being a hero. In season two episode \\"Three Ghosts\\", Shado is killed by Anthony Ivo, who tells Oliver to choose between her and Sara Lance. Though Oliver does not make a verbal choice, he steps in front of Sara, resulting in Ivo shooting Shado in the head. When Slade, whose mind and body have recently been altered with the Mirakuru serum, learns how Shado died, he turns on Oliver, revealing that he loved her from afar. Throughout the rest of the season, a villainous version of Shado appears as a hallucination, urging Slade to avenge her death. Season three introduces Shado's twin sister Mei (also portrayed by Jade) who has been looking for her since she vanished. After surviving an ambush from A.R.G.U.S., Oliver reveals to Mei, who has become aware that Oliver and Shado were lovers, that she and Yao Fei are dead and Mei thanks Oliver for finally giving her some closure. Shado makes subsequent hallucinatory appearances in seasons four and six, appearing to both Oliver and Slade.

His wrong- way run in the 1929 Rose Bowl is often cited as the worst blunder in the history of college football. That one play overshadowed Riegels' football talents, since he earned first team All-America honors and served as team captain for the Bears in 1929. Riegels' notability has been shared by motivational speakers who use his life as an example of overcoming setbacks. Background The 1920s saw the first golden age of California football, as the Golden Bears went 50 straight games without a defeat from 1920 to 1925, with a record of 46 wins and 4 ties. As of 2010, this is the 3rd longest unbeaten (not to be confused with winning) streak in NCAA history. The 1920‚Äì1924 squads were so dominant that they were nicknamed \\"The Wonder Teams,\\" and were coached by Andy Smith. One of the stars during this era was Brick Muller and the university later established a freshman leadership group called the Brick Muller Society. Cal won four Pacific Coast Conference championships and made three trips to the Rose Bowl during this decade, in 1921 (28‚Äì0 win over Ohio State), 1922 (0‚Äì0 tie with Washington & Jefferson), and 1929 (8‚Äì7 loss to Georgia Tech). Riegels played center on the 1928 University of California football team which had 6‚Äì1‚Äì2 record going into the Rose Bowl game. Riegels led the Golden Bears in conference minutes played that season, and he was voted onto the All-Coast team. He was a good blocker, but his strength was playing \\"roving center\\" on defense, similar to present day middle linebacker position. Cal's coach Nibs Price gave credit to Riegels as the smartest player he ever coached. Cal's Rose Bowl opponent was undefeated and had outscored its opponents 213 points to 40 after nine games played. The Rose Bowl game was broadcast nationally by radio during this time. The game On January 1, 1929, the Golden Bears faced the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, USA. Midway through the second quarter, Riegels, who played center on both offensive and defensive lines and who was then playing in a role similar to that of the modern defensive nose guard or nose tackle, picked up a fumble by Tech's Jack \\"Stumpy\\" Thomason. Just 30 yards away from the Yellow Jackets' end zone, Riegels was somehow turned around and ran 69 yards in the wrong direction. The following describes what transpired from Riegels perspective: Teammate and quarterback Benny Lom chased Riegels, screaming at him to stop. Known for his speed, Lom finally caught up with Riegels at California's 3-yard line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately hit by a wave of Tech players and tackled back to the 1-yard line. The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Tech's Vance Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Georgia Tech a 2‚Äì0 lead. During Roy's wrong way run, Georgia Tech's coach Bill Alexander said to his excited players who were jumping up and down near the Tech bench: \\"Sit down. Sit down. He's just running the wrong way. Every step he takes is to our advantage\\" Broadcaster Graham McNamee, who was calling the game on the radio, said during Roy's wrong way run: \\"What am I seeing? What's wrong with me? Am I crazy? Am I crazy? Am I crazy?\\" After the play, Riegels was so distraught that he had to be talked into returning to the game by coach Nibs Price for the second half. Roy said \\"Coach, I can't do it. I've ruined you, I've ruined myself, I've ruined the University of California. I couldn't face that crowd to save my life.\\" Coach Price responded by saying \\"Roy, get up and go back out there ‚Äî the game is only half over.\\" Riegels did play, and he turned in a stellar second half performance, including blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, but that was not enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8‚Äì7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks. Aftermath After the game, coach Nibs Price defended Riegels, saying \\"It was an accident that might have happened to anyone.\\" That one play overshadowed Riegels' football talents. Georgia Tech center and captain Peter Pund said Riegels was \\"the best center I have played against all year. He's a battler, and he never quit.\\"The Rose Bowl - Michelle L. Turner - Google Books Riegels would take his spot as team captain during his senior year, earning All-America honors, and he helped the Bears to a 7‚Äì1‚Äì1 record during the following season. Later, the NCAA football rules committee would pass a rule barring a player from advancing a recovered fumble once it hits the ground, which remained in place for several decades. According to one contemporary article, there were approximately 4,500 stories totaling an estimated 250,000 column inches written about Riegels' wrong way run in newspapers across the United States. Riegels gained notoriety from his wrong way run, but he was able to capitalize on his blunder, parodying his famous run in vaudeville acts. The opening sequence of the 1929 Frank Capra movie Flight is based on Riegels and uses photographs of him. In 1965, the movie John Goldfarb, Please Come Home was released and the lead character performs a similar blunder in his college years, earning the name \\"Wrong Way\\" Goldfarb. In 2011, a picture book written by Dan Gutman was published with title \\"The Day Roy Riegels Ran the Wrong Way,\\" which provides play-by-play description of this moment in sports history. Looking back on the play years later, Regiels said \\"I was embarrassed when I realized what I had done. I wanted a hole to open in the ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it.\\" Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: \\"All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it.\\" Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked \\"If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way.\\" Riegels also said \\"You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it.\\" When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, \\"Believe me, I feel I've earned this.\\" Riegels sent letters to athletes who made similar mistakes. For example, Riegels sent a letter to Paramount High School's Jan Bandringa in 1957, who had intercepted a pass only to run it 55 yards into his own end zone, resulting in a safety for Centennial High, who won the game 9‚Äì7. Riegels wrote in the letter: \\"For many years I've had to go along and laugh whenever my wrong-way run was brought up, even though I've grown tired listening and reading about it. But it certainly wasn't the most serious thing in the world. I regretted doing it, even as you do, but you'll get over it.\\" In addition, during an NFL game in 1964 between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers, Minnesota defensive end Jim Marshall ran a recovered fumble 66 yards into his own end zone (resulting in a safety, but the Vikings won 27‚Äì22). Riegels reportedly later sent Marshall a letter reading \\"Welcome to the club\\". In later years, Riegels said his blunder made him a better person. \\"I gained true understanding of life from my Rose Bowl mistake,\\" he said in an interview with the Pasadena Star. \\"I learned you can bounce back from misfortune and view it as just something adverse that happened to you.\\" In 1991, Riegels was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame. He was posthumously elected to Cal's Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2003, a panel from the College Football Hall of Fame and CBS Sports chose Riegels' \\"Wrong way run in the Rose Bowl\\" one of six \\"Most Memorable Moments of the Century.\\" Family and personal life Riegels was born to Max Jakob Andreas Riegels and Beda Helena Nilsdotter. His father was from Denmark and his mother was from Sweden. Riegels had 2 sisters named Elsie and Dora and a brother named William. He was married to Barbara Bailey (1916‚Äì1985). Riegels had four children: David, Richard, Alexa Richmond, and Helen Mackey. Riegels graduated from the University of California in 1931 with a degree in agriculture. Riegels became a teacher and coached football at California and at the high school and junior college levels.Los Angeles Times, December 29, 2006, \\"Sam Chapman, 90; halfback on last Cal team to win Rose Bowl\\" accessed 2006-01-01; He served as an officer in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II and later worked in the agriculture field and as a cannery executive. In 1955 Riegels started his own agricultural chemicals dealership in Woodland, California, Roy Riegels Chemicals, earning plaudits for his contributions to California farming from the state legislature and governor. Riegels sold the company and retired in 1976. He died in March 1993 in his sleep at his home at the age of 84 due to complications from Parkinson's disease.

The name is a combination of the Mid-Engine with Four turbochargers on a Twelve-cylinder engine. Background There were two ME Four-Twelve vehicles produced. The first was an auto show version using performance expertise from Daimler, but with limited operational capabilities. It was designed behind-the-scenes during 2003 by a small team. The auto show vehicle, unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, took less than one year for design and development. The exterior design was done by American Brian Nielander. Chrysler announced at the 2004 NAIAS that the ME Four-Twelve was a full running prototype. At the time, key personnel within the Street & Racing Technology group at Chrysler directed by Dan Knott (also responsible for the Dodge Viper, SRT production adaptations such as the Dodge Neon SRT-4 and Dodge Ram SRT-10, Dodge Motorsports, and Mopar performance parts) were alerted that another project was being considered; to design and build a fully engineered and functional prototype demonstration vehicle capable of achieving the published performance claims and being available for media track evaluation by the summer of 2004. Design The chassis tub of the ME Four-Twelve is carbon-fiber and aluminum honeycomb. It uses a 4130 steel rear subframe and aluminum castings. The body is lightweight carbon fiber. The low profile of the vehicle contributes to its aerodynamics, while multiple air-intakes enhance cooling. The car uses 265/35ZR19 tires in the front and 335/30ZR20 tires in the rear (on 19- and 20-inch cast-aluminum wheels, respectively). The brakes are six-piston-calipers with 16-inch discs at the front and back. The modified 6.0 L aluminum Mercedes-Benz M120 V12 engine featured a newly developed cylinder head, special intake and exhaust manifolds, as well as forged internals such as pistons and crankshaft to accommodate the forced induction system (i.e., four turbochargers), which brought the output of the engine to . This would have made it the most powerful, as well as the fastest, road-going production vehicle at the time. The seven-speed transmission is a dual-clutch automatic transmission,Chrysler ME Four-Twelve - Car and Driver with the capability of shifting gears in 200 milliseconds. Claimed acceleration from 0-60 mph is 2.9 seconds, and 0-100 mph in 6.2 seconds. It can cover a quarter mile in 10.6 seconds, with a trap speed of . Estimated top speed was claimed to be . The ME 412's interior features leather seats, a carbon fiber dashboard, and a chrome-covered center console with a leather tilt steering wheel, and gunmetal gauges. Other features include dual-zone climate control, a premium audio system, keyless access, and a push-button start system. The roof is made of glass.

The Court developed a test for determining when a claim of parliamentary privilege can protect a legislative body or its members from legal scrutiny. Besides the parties to the case (the House of Commons of Canada, Member of Parliament Gilbert Parent, Satnam Vaid, and the Canadian Human Rights Commission), the Court heard from the following interveners: the Attorney General of Canada, Senator Serge Joyal, Senator Mobina Jaffer, the Canadian Association of Professional Employees, the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, and the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Background Satnam Vaid was a chauffeur for the various Speakers of the House of Commons from 1984 to 1994. On January 11, 1995, Vaid was dismissed because he allegedly refused to accept the new duties under a revised job description. Vaid filed a grievance for his termination, and on July 25, 1995, the Board of Adjudication ruled in Vaid's favour and ordered that he be allowed to resume his employment as chauffeur. During the adjudication, Vaid claimed racial discrimination, which the Board said was not made out. On August 17, 1995, Vaid returned to work, at which time he was told that the chauffeur's position had been changed to a bilingual one, and Vaid was sent for French language training. On April 8, 1997, Vaid requested that he be allowed to return to work. On May 12, 1997, the Speaker's office, under then Speaker, Gilbert Parent, replied that due to reorganization, Vaid's position was being made surplus effective May 29, 1997. =Judicial history= On July 10, 1997, Vaid complained to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, claiming that the Speaker and the House of Commons discriminated against him due to race, colour, and national or ethnic origin. Vaid also claimed workplace harassment. The complaints were referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. Parent and the House of Commons challenged the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the complaint due to parliamentary privilege. Parent and the House of Commons sought judicial review at the Federal Court, Trial Division, which was refused. This decision was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal. Reasons of the Court A unanimous decision of the Court was written by Binnie J. The Court found that the first step of determining whether parliamentary privilege exists at the federal level in a particular area is to ascertain whether the existence and scope of the claimed privilege have been authoritatively established in relation the Parliament of Canada or to the House of Commons at Westminster. If the existence and scope of the claimed privilege has not been authoritatively established, then it must be tested against the doctrine of necessity. That is, the assembly or member seeking its immunity must show that the sphere of activity for which privilege is claimed is so closely and directly connected with the fulfillment by the assembly or its members of their functions as a legislative and deliberative body, including the assembly's work in holding the government to account, that outside interference would undermine the level of autonomy required to enable the assembly and its members to do their work with dignity and efficiency. The Court went on to find that parliamentary privilege was not so broad as to protect employment matters. Justice Binnie wrote that: :I have no doubt that privilege attaches to the House's relations with some of its employees, but the appellants have insisted on the broadest possible coverage without leading any evidence to justify such a sweeping immunity, or a lesser immunity, or indeed any evidence of necessity at all. ... The appellants having failed to establish the privilege in the broad and all-inclusive terms asserted, the respondents are entitled to have the appeal disposed of according to the ordinary employment and human rights law that Parliament has enacted with respect to employees within federal legislative jurisdiction. However, unrelated to the parliamentary privilege issue, the Court found that the Canadian Human Rights Act did not apply to Parliamentary employees, as their labour issues were under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act. Therefore, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal did not have jurisdiction on the matter, and the appeal was allowed.

Pack ice of the Arctic Ocean accumulates off Cape Columbia. The twin otter machine stands on the fast ice between the stacked pack ice (right) and the mainland Ice pressure ridges of the Arctic Ocean off Cape Columbia As the northernmost mainland point of Canada, Cape Columbia is exposed to the ice drift of the Arctic pack ice. The approximately 2 meter thick pack ice of the Arctic Ocean moves several hundred meters per hour from east to west. As a result, mighty ice pressure ridges can be piled up at Cape Columbia. History In 1876, Pelham Aldrich was the first European to reach Cape Columbia. He was a lieutenant with the expedition (1875-76) of British explorer George Nares. = Peary = Robert Peary chose the Cape as the location for the northernmost depot of his final attempt to reach the Pole (1909), not only for its proximity but because it is located far enough west to be out of the ice current setting down Robeson Channel. From Cape Columbia his party planned to strike straight north over the ice of the Arctic Sea. His winter camp and ship the Roosevelt were situated some southeast, at Cape Sheridan near Alert. Peary's sledge divisions left the Roosevelt from February 15 to 22, 1909, rendezvoused at Cape Columbia, and on March 1 the expedition left Cape Columbia, heading across the Arctic Ocean for the Pole. The 84th parallel was crossed on March 18, the 86th on March 23. Peary returned to land at Cape Columbia again on April 23. Peary's claim to have reached the North Pole has long been subject to doubt. While some polar historians believe that Peary honestly thought he had reached the pole, others have suggested that he was guilty of deliberately exaggerating his accomplishments.

It is named after the Hungarian born American economist, Tibor Scitovsky. According to Scitovsky, Kaldor-Hicks criterion involves contradictory and inconsistent results. What Scitovsky demonstrated was it is possible that if an allocation A is deemed superior to another allocation B by the Kaldor compensation criteria, then by a subsequent set of moves by the same criteria, we can prove that B is also superior to A. The paradox occurs when the gainer from the change of allocation A to allocation B can compensate the loser for making the change, but the loser could also then compensate the gainer for going back to the original position. Scitovsky pointed out that to get at the correct criterion of welfare we must remove this contradiction. He has therefore offered his own criterion called the ‚ÄúScitovsky Double criterion‚Äù. The Scitovsky criterion was developed by Tibor Scitovsky in his paper ‚ÄúA Note on Welfare Propositions in Economics‚Äù, 1941.

George Bentham (1800-1884) and Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817-1911) were British botanists who were closely affiliated to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in England. Their system of botanical taxonomy was based on the principle of natural affinities and is considered as pre-Darwinian as it does not take evolution into account.

Mr. Dimitriadis had designed and built a light four-wheel passenger automobile (model 505) in 1958 with the intent to produce it. A tax imposed on four-wheel automobiles at the time, though, limited the car's market prospects; thus, he abandoned that plan, focusing instead on the production of three-wheelers - taxed as \\"motorcycles\\" in Greece. In 1962 he started production of a light three-wheeler passenger car under licence of Fuldamobil of Germany as the Attica model 200 (it was much easier for cars certified abroad to receive certification for production in Greece). The car was built with few changes from the original German design, but later two different cabriolet versions were developed by Attica itself. 200 cc engines (by Sachs, Heinkel as well as engines built by Attica itself) were used to power different versions of the car. The model became very popular in Greece and is remembered to this date. Another Greek company, Alta, soon claimed a market share in the same category, introducing a similar vehicle in 1968; this was also based on Fuldamobil technology but it was extensively modified, with a more modern design. Attica 200 was nonetheless produced until 1971. In 1968 Bioplastic utilized the Attica 200 design to create a light three-wheeler truck brand named Delta (oddly enough, the rear-half of the 200 had become the front-half of Delta!), sold with modest success. In 1965 Attica had already made an effort to enter the market of four-wheel automobiles, introducing the Carmel 12; the car was built under licence of Israeli Autocars company (which, in turn, had used British Reliant technology). In fact, the term \\"manufacture\\" is probably not appropriate in this case, as most parts were imported. Despite a publicity campaign, the car did not sell well and only about 100 Attica Carmel 12's were actually produced. In 1977 Dimitriadis transformed Bioplastic into a new company (DIM Motor) to produce the DIM, an entirely new passenger automobile designed and developed by his company. The car was presented in the Geneva Motor Show in 1977 but its life was very brief: only a few were produced.  References  *L.S. Skartsis and G.A.

In addition, Tyler hosts Eye on New York, a half-hour weekly community affairs program for WCBS, as well as several annual local specials: CBS 2 at Tonys, CBS 2 at the Met and Tunnel to Towers Run. Tyler first joined WCBS as a weekend anchor and a reporter on July 16, 1990. Life and news career Tyler was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and grew up in Worthington, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. She graduated from Thomas Worthington High School, and is an alum of Boston University. Tyler began her career in the early 1980s at WCOL-FM in Columbus. In May 1981 she joined the city's CBS affiliate, WBNS-TV as a reporter, and by 1986 became a co-anchor of the station's evening newscasts. Tyler then moved to New York, and to WCBS-TV in June 1990 as weekend anchor and reporter. Along with Reggie Harris, she was part of the first African-American team in the New York market to anchor a newscast. She quickly moved up to the 5:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. newscasts in 1993. At WCBS-TV, Tyler has worked alongside some of the better-known television news anchors in New York City. Among Tyler's anchoring partners are Jim Jensen, Brian Williams, Ernie Anastos, John Johnson, Michele Marsh, Ira Joe Fisher and Roz Abrams. She also worked with Stephen Clark, Don Dahler, and Chris Wragge. Tyler remained in her post through a major staff reduction in November 1996 when several of the station's on-air personalities, including Marsh, Johnson, and Harris, were fired. Tyler returned as the anchor on WCBS's 11 p.m. newscast, in addition to her 6 p.m. duties, both alongside Jim Rosenfield, on April 17, 2006 as part of a shakeup in anchors where no one stayed in their old capacity. She replaced veteran WABC-TV anchor Roz Abrams, who had replaced her a few years prior (Abrams moved to the noon and 5pm newscasts, but is now no longer with the station) only to be replaced again in 2007 by Kristine Johnson. She had a relationship with Phil Collins from 2006 until 2014. She lives in Stamford. Other media appearances In 2000, she guest starred as herself on Everybody Loves Raymond in the episode \\"Robert's Rodeo,\\" promoting an upcoming news story with video of a bull chasing a police officer ‚Äì that officer being Robert Barone.

The southbound span was opened in 1935 and acquired by the State of New York in 1950. The northbound span was finished in 1963. A northbound-only toll is collected on the Tonawanda side of the bridge. Description The bridges are twin truss arch bridges with a steel through-arch in the middle. Both crossings have a navigation clearance, which was designed to allow tall lake freighters and tanker ships to pass beneath it. A northbound-only toll is presently collected via open-road cashless tolling. The open-road tolling began operating on March 29, 2018, replacing conventional toll booths.

Drivers without an E-ZPass will have a picture of their license plate taken, and the toll will be mailed to them. History The southbound bridge was completed in 1935. Mr. Frank J. Offermann Sr., the former Sheriff of Erie County, owner of the Buffalo Bisons Ball Club and prominent resident of Grand Island was active in getting the bridges sanctioned. Also in 1935 after his untimely death, Supervisor Messmer proposed changing the name of the boulevard connecting the Grand Island Bridges to Offermann Drive, however this was never done, reference Buffalo Courier Express Feb 14, 1935. as a two-lane, two-way structure carrying NY 325 from Tonawanda to Grand Island. It became part of NY 324 by 1937. In 1950, the State of New York assumed ownership of the bridge as part of the Niagara Thruway's construction. A twin bridge erected to the northeast of the original structure was completed in 1963, at which time all northbound traffic was moved onto the new crossing and the 1935 span became southbound-only. thumb center upright=3 South Grand Island Bridge from Isle View Park in Tonawanda (view upstream, from northeast) The 1935 span that now carries southbound traffic is behind the 1963 northbound span. alt=Profile of South Grand Island Bridge. Two sky-blue steel spans cross the river in five arches. The central arch alone is above the roadway, permitting passage of large freight ships. While the twin bridges were built decades apart, they appear nearly identical. It is clear that builders in the 1960s took great care in matching the original 1930s architecture, but there are slight differences. The 1935 bridge has stone cutwaters on the piers, while the 1963 bridge has steel-faced cutwaters. Also, renovations of the southbound bridge have created a guard rail that looks quite different from the one on the northbound bridge. The northbound span was renovated by American Bridge Company from 2008 to 2010. American Bridge Company replaced the deck (road), sidewalk, and barriers as part of a $48 million project. In August 2019, the bridges were closed to the public to be used as a filming site for A Quiet Place Part II.

The latter helmet was a fifteenth and sixteenth century tournament helmet style.  Construction  Spangenhelm (iron), Migration Period - Museum of the Cetinska Krajina Region - Sinj, Croatia The name Spangenhelm is of German origin. Spangen refers to the metal strips that form the framework for the helmet and could be translated as braces, and -helm simply means helmet. The strips connect three to six steel or bronze plates. The frame takes a conical design that curves with the shape of the head and culminates in a point. The front of the helmet may include a nose protector (a nasal). Older spangenhelms often include cheek flaps made from metal or leather. Spangenhelms may incorporate mail as neck protection, thus forming a partial aventail. Some spangenhelms include eye protection in a shape that resembles modern eyeglass frames, and are thus sometimes called \\"spectacle helmets\\". Other spangenhelms include a full face mask. The spangenhelm was an effective protection that was relatively easy to produce. Weakness of the design were its partial head protection and its jointed construction. It was replaced by similarly shaped helmets made with one-piece skulls (nasal helms), kettle hats and eventually the great helm or casque.  History  Sarmatian warriors with Spangenhelms, Trajan's Column (around 110 A.D.) The spangenhelm arrived in Western Europe by way of what is now southern Russia and Ukraine, spread by nomadic Iranian tribes such as the Scythians and Sarmatians who lived among the Eurasian steppes. By the 6th century it was the most common helmet design in Europe and in popular use throughout the Middle East. However, helmets of the spangenhelm type were used much longer. Some of the nasal helmets depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry from the 11th century appear to be built as a Spangenhelm construction. The same is true for illustrations of the Morgan Bible from the 13th century.  Similar helmets  Similar but more simple helmets, the so-called broadband helmets were used in parallel. These helmets may have been used until the 10th century, as depicted in the Leiden Maccabees manuscript from the early 10th century. Related to the Spangenhelm were also lamellar helmets or intermediate Lamellar-Spangen helmets, like the helmet from a 6th-century boys grave, found under the Cologne Cathedral.Paul Mortimer: Woden's Warriors: Warfare, Beliefs, Arms & Armour in Northern Europe During the 6-7th Centuries. Anglo-Saxon Books, 2011.

He was Associate Professor and Professor of Economics at Stanford University from 1946 through 1958 and Eberle Professor of Economics from 1970 until his retirement in 1976, when he became Professor Emeritus. In honor of his deep contributions to economic analysis, he was elected Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association, Fellow of the Royal Economic Society, member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. Life Scitovsky was born in Hungary in 1910. As the de indicates, he was born into a noble family; his father, Tibor Scitovszky, held the post of Foreign Minister. He was educated at the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University (from which he held an undergraduate degree in law), University of Cambridge, and the London School of Economics. He came to the United States on a traveling fellowship. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, in counter-intelligence. Because he still had family in German-allied Hungary he changed his name during this time to Thomas Dennis. After a spell at Stanford from 1946‚Äì1958, he left for Berkeley and remained there until 1968, although he was on leave to do research at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The stories combine elements of horror and the supernatural (with the occasional alien) with a large dose of humour which has received a mixed reaction from readers. Characters *Becky Miller (Bec) - student and part-time witch. *Jarrod Kawl (Kawl) - a usually stoned hanger on who either accidentally gets the pair into trouble or accidentally gets them out of it (or both). *Pierre Romanov - the greatest Pest Control Expert that ever lived (in Pest Control). Plot Bec and Kawl are art students who dabble in the occult and this leads them into a whole range of adventures from meeting the tooth fairies and defending the Earth from alien traffic cones. The stories are often parodical, taking the form of humorous versions of staple themes of fantasy, science fiction and horror. The heavy use of parody also extends to dialogue and characters. Influences The strip is most obviously influenced by popular culture, in particular movies and comic books. Indeed, many of the minor characters are directly based upon already-existing fictional creations such as Harry Potter, Hellblazer and the Sandman. The idea of two young people living a pop culture- heavy existence in a shared flat bears a strong resemblance to the Channel 4 sitcom Spaced.

He specialized in singing poetry, particularly that of Louis Aragon. He had a left-wing sympathy that found its way into a few songs. Biography Ferrat was born in Vaucresson, Hauts-de-Seine, the youngest of four children from a modest family which moved to Versailles in 1935, where Ferrat studied at the Jules Ferry College. His Russian-born father (naturalized in 1928) was forced to wear the yellow star and deported to Auschwitz in 1942, where he died. In the early 1950s, he started in Parisian cabaret. After that he avoided any particular musical style, but remained faithful to himself, his friends and his public. In 1956, he set \\"Les yeux d'Elsa\\" (\\"Elsa's eyes\\"), a Louis Aragon poem which Ferrat loved, to music. Its rendition by popular artist Andr√© Claveau brought Ferrat some initial recognition as a songwriter. His first 45 RPM single was released in 1958, without success. It was not until 1959, with publisher G√©rard Meys, who also became his close friend and associate, that his career started to flourish. He signed with Decca and released his second single, \\"Ma M√¥me\\", in 1960 under the musical direction of Meys. In 1961, Ferrat married Christine S√®vres, a singer who performed some of his songs. She died in 1981 at age 50.Biographie de Christine S√®vres , skynet.be; accessed 29 January 2016. He met Alain Goraguer, who became an arranger of his songs. His debut album, Deux Enfants du Soleil, was released that year. Ferrat also wrote songs for Zizi Jeanmaire and went on the road, sharing billing with her at the Alhambra for six months. Nuit et Brouillard (\\"Night and Fog\\"), which followed in 1963, was awarded the Acad√©mie Charles Cros's Grand Prix du Disque and showed any topic could be put in songs. Ferrat toured again in 1965, but stopped performing on stage in 1973. 1980 In 1990, he received an award from the Soci√©t√© des auteurs, compositeurs et √©diteurs de musique, (SACEM) the French association of songwriters, composers and music publishers. Death Ferrat died in Aubenas, Ard√®che, following a long illnessJean Ferrat is dead at the age of 79. He lived in Antraigues-sur-Volane, a small village of not even 700 people in Ardeche. Acclaim In 2013 Ferrat's song, Nuit et Brouillard, appeared in the BBC's list of 20 songs that changed the world. In 2015, a tribute album was released by Columbia Records where various artists interpreted songs by Jean Ferrat.

It is loosely based on the real life Operation Chastise and the 1955 film. The game was released in 1984 for the ColecoVision and Commodore 64; in 1985 for Apple II, MS-DOS, MSX and ZX Spectrum; then in 1986 for the Amstrad CPC and NEC PC-9801. Gameplay The Dam Busters aircraft instruments You choose from three different night missions, each of which is increasingly difficult. In all three, your goal is to successfully bomb a dam. On the practice run, you can approach and bomb the dam without any other obstacles. The two other missions feature various enemies to overcome, and you start from either the French coast or a British airfield. During your flight, you control every aspect of the bomber from each of the seven crew positions: Pilot, Front Gunner, Tail Gunner, Bomb Aimer, Navigator, Engineer, and Squadron Leader. Leaving any of these positions unattended during an event could spell the death of the person in that position, rendering it useless during further encounters. You must evade enemies, plan your approach, and set all of the variables (speed, height, timing, etc.) to execute a successful bombing. Sometimes, it becomes necessary to deal with emergencies, such as engine fires. While en route to the target you can expect to encounter attacks by enemy aircraft, barrage balloons, flak and enemy searchlights. Events like this will flash along the border of the screen, while indicating the key to press to take you to the station in need of assistance. For example, when flying through enemy search lights, you'll need to man the gunner's station and shoot out the lights on the ground. If left unattended, you can expect flak and enemy aircraft to start damaging your bomber. Once you begin the final run to your target, you are presented with the custom bombing sights, as made famous by the story. When you toggle the bomb, you are shown an animation of the bomb bouncing along the lake and hitting (or not hitting) the target dam. Reception Info rated The Dam Busters on the Commodore 64 three-plus stars out of five, stating that it \\"lacks the depth and variability of a game like Silent Service, but has better than average graphics and play features\\". Computer Gaming World gave The Dam Busters two out of five points in an overview of World War II simulations, stating \\"this product's graphics and 'feel' make it too much of a game and not enough of a simulation\\".

About two years after the album's release, guitarist Jason Becker was diagnosed with ALS, rendering him paralyzed and completely unable to play to this day. Also two years later, guitarist Marty Friedman joined the band Megadeth. Critical reception In a contemporary review, Wolfgang Sch√§fer of Rock Hard was not overly impressed by the album but remarked how Friedman and Becker refrained \\"from superfluous solo escapades\\", making the music more accessible and fuelling the suspicion that Mike Varney wanted \\"to repeat the success of the dissolved Racer X with this band.\\" Andy Hinds at AllMusic found Go Off! an improvement on their 1987 debut album Speed Metal Symphony and compared the \\"slightly more song-oriented approach\\" to contemporaries Racer X. He praised Friedman and Becker's technical craft as \\"a very interesting listen at times\\" and that \\"there are even some beautiful moments, like the outro of the title track\\", while also noting an element of restraint in their playing compared to Speed Metal Symphony. However, much criticism was directed at singer Peter Marrino, with Hinds lambasting his vocals as \\"annoying\\" and the lyrics \\"ridiculous\\". Martin Popoff reviewed positively the album and considered it \\"too crazy, professional and intense for its day\\", becoming \\"a cult classic\\" and \\"a mid- years progressive metal cornersone\\". He was also critical of Marrino's vocals, but praised Deen Castronovo's performance, \\"possibly his chopsiest of a long career\\".

He played for the New York Yankees (; ), Seattle Pilots (), and the Milwaukee Brewers (). Ferraro threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Playing career Ferraro was originally signed as an amateur free agent by the Yankees, where he would have two stints in the Majors with New York. He was left unprotected in the 1968 expansion draft, and he was selected by the Seattle Pilots, but after only five games and four at-bats, he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles, where he spent two years in the minors. However, in 1971, he was traded back to the Brewers (the Pilots moved to Milwaukee after only one season in Seattle), where he would play his only season as a regular player. In 1973, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins, but was promptly released. He tried one last comeback with the Yankees in 1974, but he never made it back to the Majors. Managerial career He turned to managing in the Yankee farm system in 1974, and he was highly successful in his five-year career (through 1978), winning pennants at Class A, Double-A and Triple-A levels. He was the Yankees' third-base coach in 1979‚Äì80, but his tenure in that post included a notable bad call. After Game 2 of the 1980 American League Championship Series, owner George Steinbrenner publicly criticized him for waving home runner Willie Randolph, who was thrown out at home plate for the final out of the eighth inning with Kansas City leading New York, 3‚Äì2. Steinbrenner wanted Ferraro fired summarily, but he remained at his post through the end of the league championship series, which New York lost. Then, his manager, Dick Howser, resigned over the Ferraro brouhaha. Ferraro returned to New York as a coach in 1981‚Äì82, and again in 1987‚Äì88 and 1990‚Äì91. Ferraro got his first managerial job with the Cleveland Indians to replace Dave Garcia after the 1982 season, but after a 40‚Äì60 start in , he was fired.Ferraro dismissed as Indian Manager Ferraro coached with the Kansas City Royals from 1984 to 1986, working again with Howser, and when Howser stepped down to undergo treatment for a brain tumor in July 1986, Ferraro, a survivor of kidney cancerSports of the times; Mike Ferraro's trauma, finished the season. His Major League managerial record was 76‚Äì98 over parts of two seasons. He also worked as the third base coach of the Baltimore Orioles in 1993.

Rising above the remote moorland plateau of the Cambrian Mountains, and to the west of the peaks of Radnor Forest, the summit is topped by two distinctive, large cairns. The mountain has a gentle, grassy, conical shape with a few rocks near the summit. Nearby are the summits of Gorllwyn and Y Gamriw, both over 600m. Walking Routes There are two paths to the summit which can offer impressive views. From Llannerch Yrfa, a bridleway winds up through forests in the Nant y Fedw valley before skirting the southern edge of the mountain. An alternative route may be taken starting from Rhiwnant on the edge of the Caban Coch reservoir, one of the Elan Valley Reservoirs, and following the Nant Paradwys before turning off west towards the summit cairn. Both routes pass across wild moorland and peat bogs and the path may become difficult to follow and impassable, particularly after heavy rain.

A similar car, with the same Airstream name was also sold by Chrysler's companion brand DeSoto during the period. The creation of the Airstream was an outgrowth of the unpopularity of the streamlined Chrysler Airflow, which consumers failed to embrace.

The DIM represented one more effort by Mr. Dimitriadis to design and develop a modern car entirely by his company's own means. A 400cc, air-cooled, 2-cylinder, 30-hp engine was also developed in-house to power the vehicle, but due to delays in the engine development, the car was introduced with a 600cc engine and other mechanical parts of the Fiat 126 model. A 650cc Fiat engine was also used, in an improved version. The car was finally introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1977, and for this reason received more publicity than most Greek vehicles, appearing in many international publications. All development work had been made in a factory intended for its production in Acharnes, while the company was advertised in the Greek press; plans were also made for more versions, including a sports coupe. However, the costs involved and the car's poor prospects in the Greek market (despite an effort to facelift the model) resulted in termination of production after only about ten had been produced. The whole project was abandoned in 1982, having been Georgios Dimitriadis' last venture in the automotive industry.  References  *L.S. Skartsis and G.A.

Organisational structure  The co-operative is governed by its thousands of members, who may attend and vote at its annual general meeting and special general meetings. The members exercise their will also through an unpaid elected board of directors and its committees, four part-time paid staff members (union members of the union Unifor), and hundreds of volunteers, the latter creating all the programmes. To volunteer or serve the organization, those aged 16 or older must be dues-paid members, as are thousands of people who join mainly to support the operation financially and to vote at general meetings. The station broadcasts two major fund-raising drives a year, in the spring and autumn. Government grants are a very small part of the budget.

Intrazonal soils  Intrazonal soils have more or less well-defined soil profile characteristics that reflect the dominant influence of some resident factor of relief or parent material over the classic zonal effects of climate and vegetation. There are three major sub- types, two of which have two further sub-types each. :Calcimorphic or calcareous soils develop from a limestone. It has two sub-types: ::Rendzina soils are thin soils with limited available water capacity. ::Terra rossa soils are deep red soils associated with higher rainfall than rendzina. :Hydromorphic soils form in wetland conditions. There are two sub-types: ::Gley soils - These occur when the pore spaces between the grains become saturated with water and contain no air. This lack of oxygen leads to anaerobic conditions which reduce the iron in the parent rock. This gives the soil a characteristic grey/blue colour with flecks of red. ::Peat soils form under circumstances that prevent the breakdown of vegetation completely. :Halomorphic soils form due to soil salination.  Azonal soil  These soils are formed in mountainous regions out of fine grains produced by weathering. However, due to various reasons, this fine grained material constantly slides down the slope. As a result, the time necessary for the formation of soils does not become available. Therefore, these soils remain immature. An example is soil along the slopes of the Himalayan mountains. In river plains, particularly in flood-plain areas, new alluvium is deposited every year. The time for soil formation remains inadequate. Hence, flood plain soils also remain immature. In river plains, due to alluvium and availability of water, the farmlands are fertile but the soils remain immature.

DFN has operations in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia. The organization's operations in these countries are largely centered around fundraising and advocacy.https://dfnusa.org/ In 2018, the organization changed its name from the Dalit Freedom Network to the Dignity Freedom Network to reflect their expanded mission. Programs DFN has four programming areas: education, healthcare, economic development, and trafficking prevention and rescue. In the year of 2017, DFN's USA arm alone had raised $1,706,228 and spent $2,235,867 on programs, administration, and fundraising. =Education, Healthcare & Economic Development= DFN claims that their schools and health care, anti-trafficking, and economic development programs have directly impacted an estimated 1 million people across 6,000 communities in India. DFN operates 107 English medium schools, known as Good Shepherd Schools, for 27,000 children in India, in cooperation with an initiative of the Good Shepherd Church of India. From 2010 to 2018, the schools have graduated more than 2,300 children. The school curriculum consists of English, math, science, as well as curriculum that teaches the principles of human dignity and worth for all people.

In healthcare, DFN has sent dozens of medical teams to Dalit villages for preventative care and in response to emergencies.Rocky Mountain News Story on DFN In villages, they provide care in a clinic through dentists, doctors and nurses, and also educate villagers on hygiene and preventative health care. After treatment, DFN and other associated evangelical workers will pray with the patient, share the Gospel, and attempt to convert the patient to Christianity. =Church planting= DFN states that a \\"key part of our mission is also to plant churches in the communities we serve, because we know that true transformation happens when people come to know the saving love of Jesus Christ.\\" =Advocacy= On October 6, 2005, DFN hosted a conference entitled Racism and Caste Based Discrimination in India: Implications for the US-India Relationship, where talks were given by Udit Raj and Kancha Ilaiah, both prominent critics of the caste system who advocate for Dalits to convert out of Hinduism. D'Souza also testified at a United States Congressional hearing on the same day.

Hsu and Benjamin assert that NGOs are using endemic problems with caste discrimination as a pretext to gain a foothold in Indian society that have increased social tensions without any meaningful benefit to the Dalit community.

Publishing history The idea for the publication was first raised in 1878 by the Religious Tract Society, as a means to encourage younger children to read and to instill Christian morals during their formative years. The first issue was published on 18 January 1879. The final issue, a \\"Special Souvenir Edition, Price 2/-\\", was dated February 1967 and was published on 27 January 1967. It was a facsimile reprint of the first issue, complete with adverts. It had a panel on the front cover giving a very brief history and stating that it would \\"appear in future as the BOY'S OWN ANNUAL, edited by Jack Cox\\". The paper was published weekly in a cycle which followed the school year (Autumn through to Summer) until November 1913, when it became monthly. In total, 2511 issues of the paper were published. There was an extra Christmas Number (edition) of the magazine from 1884‚Äì85 until 1912‚Äì13 and an extra Summer Number from 1884‚Äì85 until 1900‚Äì01. From 1879 each year's issues were bound together and sold as the Boy's Own Annual. In the initial years, readers were invited to purchase covers at the end of the publishing year and have the weekly issues bound. This produced some interesting minor variations in order and contents. The Annuals ceased publication after the 1940‚Äì41 edition as a result of wartime paper rationing. The Annuals included all the text in the weekly (and later monthly) issues, with additional illustrations. Later attempts at a smaller format annual, under Jack Cox's editorship, were the Boy's Own Companion from 1959 through 1963, and the Boy's Own Annual II from 1964‚Äì65 through 1975‚Äì76. In 1939 the publication was taken over by Lutterworth Press, and in 1963 by Purnell and Sons Ltd. It was published at the end of its life in 1967 by BPC Publishing Ltd, who are believed to have started publishing the paper in 1965. Contents The Boy's Own Paper, front page, 11 April 1891 The contents usually included adventure stories and stories about public school life; notes on how to practise nature study, sports and games; instructions for how to make items including canoes; puzzles and essay competitions. One of the stories in the opening issue was \\"My First Football Match\\", the first of many by Talbot Baines Reed set in public schools (Reed, who had not in fact attended such a school, later became the paper's first assistant editor); and the first volume's serials included \\"From Powder Monkey to Admiral, or The Stirring Days of the British Navy\\". In the same volume, Captain Matthew Webb contributed an account of how he swam the English Channel. In its first decade the paper promoted the British Empire as the zenith of civilisation and reflected the attitudes towards other races which were taken for granted in Britain at the time. In 1885, for example, it described its vision of \\"the typical negro\\": :\\"The arm is two inches longer in proportion than that of a Caucasian, and the hands hang level with the kneecaps; the facial angle is seventy as against eighty three, the brain weighs thirty five as against forty five; the skull is much thicker ... there is no growth in intelligence once manhood is reached.\\"Wascana Review, Volumes 12‚Äì14. University of Saskatchewan, 1977. p. 87. Readers frequently wrote in with questions to the paper: answers to these letters to the Editor were included in each edition although the original letter was never printed, leaving the reader to guess what the original question might have been. The responses given were often crushingly ascerbic and to the point. Contributors This plate appeared in the 36th The Boy's Own Annual (1913-1914), and is based on the painting A Very Gallant Gentleman by John Charles Dollman. It depicts the last moments of Lawrence Oates. Many prominent authors and personalities contributed to the paper. W.G. Grace wrote for several issues, as did Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne and R.M. Ballantyne. Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scout Movement, was a regular columnist and urged readers \\"to live clean, manly and Christian lives\\". Less well-known writers included William Gordon Stables, W. E. Cule, Sid G. Hedges and Hugh Pembroke Vowles. Edward Whymper contributed engravings (including the masthead). Gilbert Davey, who went on to publish Fun with Radio introduced many youngsters to a career in Radio and Electronics. Between 1941‚Äì61 there were 60 issues with stories about Biggles written by W. E. Johns. In the 1960s other occasional contributors included Isaac Asimov and the astronomer Patrick Moore, who contributed several articles about the solar system and would answer questions on astronomical matters in the \\"You Ask Us\\" section of the paper.

These editions were identical to the British editions except for a four-page \\"cover\\", dated one month later than the contents, which contained advertisements for Toronto businesses. Examples of these \\"reprints\\" have been noted for August 1884 and August 1885. In contemporary popular culture In British popular culture, improbable or daring endeavours are often described as \\"Boy's Own stuff\\", in reference to the heroic content of the magazine's stories. Alternatively, many associate the magazine with well- intentioned heroes who do not have inhibitions about trying to right wrongs. In the 1989 book Great Work of Time, dealing with an alternative history of the British Empire, writer John Crowley depicts Cecil Rhodes as avidly reading Boy's Own Magazine when he was no longer a boy but at the peak of his empire- building career.

Over the next three seasons Edwards continued to produce at the plate as he progressed up the Indians farm system, batting .337, .279, and .331 for the Selma Cloverleafs, Burlington Indians, and the Salt Lake City Bees respectively, before earning his call up to the big league club in 1962. After batting .270 in 63 games in an Indians uniform, Doc was traded to the Kansas City Athletics for Dick Howser during the season. He spent the full 1964 season with Kansas City, then was dealt to the New York Yankees shortly after start of the 1965 campaign, where he caught 284 innings in 43 games while filling in for injured twelve-time All Star catcher Elston Howard. Following the season, he was traded back to the Cleveland Indians. With highly regarded Cuban catcher Joe Azcue seeing most of the playing time for the Tribe, and eight-time All Star and former World Series champion Del Crandall providing senior leadership, there wasn't room for Edwards on the big league roster in 1966, and he was sent down to the Indians AAA farm club in Portland. After one season with the Pacific Coast League Beavers, he was shipped to the Houston Astros and assigned to their PCL club in Oklahoma City, where he spent the 1967 season before being released. He was picked up by the Philadelphia Phillies in November of that year, and after two years with their AAA affiliates in the PCL in San Diego (1968) and Eugene (1969), the Phillies named him as their bullpen coach for the 1970 season. Ironically, it was this coaching assignment, and not his four years as a AAA player, that would guide his path back to playing in the major leagues. In June 1970, a series of injuries left the Phillies short a catcher and they activated the then 33-year-old Edwards. Doc responded with two-hits and caught a Jim Bunning-Dick Selma two-hitter. In his unlikely return to the majors that season, Doc Edwards would catch 35 games and bat a respectable .269 for the Phillies in what would prove to be the final season of his playing career. Coaching and managing career In 1973, the 36-year-old Edwards was named Manager of the West Haven Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League, beginning a 40-year journey that would see him manage over 3,800 games in 33 seasons for 12 teams in 13 different cities; located in ten states and provinces across two countries; situated in ten different major, minor, and independent professional baseball leagues. Following a two-year stint in West Haven, Edwards was hired by the Chicago Cubs where he managed their AA affiliate in Midland, TX in 1975, and AAA club in Wichita in 1976. From there he skippered the Expos‚Äô AA Quebec Metros (1977) and AAA Denver Bears (1978), before moving over to the Baltimore Orioles, where he was assigned to the International League‚Äôs Rochester Red Wings. He spent three years at the helm of the Red Wings, where he managed in one of the most memorable games in minor league lore. In April 1981, the Red Wings and Pawtucket Red Sox played in a 33-inning marathon, which remains as the longest game in professional baseball history. In 1982, Edwards was presented with the opportunity to return to his home state, and to the big league club that gave him his first shot in professional baseball. The Cleveland Indians assigned him to the AAA International League Charleston Charlies, located in the West Virginia capital not far from his hometown of Red Jacket. He managed the Charlies in 1982 and 1983, before the franchise was uprooted and moved to Maine, where he continued with the team (rechristened as the Maine Guides), for two more years. His allegiance to the Indians was finally rewarded in , when he was hired to replace Pat Corrales as the manager of the big league club.Indians fire Manager Corrales and promote Edwards Unfortunately for Edwards, their futility continued (they had only two winning seasons between 1968 and 1987). Edwards was fired with 19 games remaining in the season and replaced with scout John Hart. Doc also managed the independent Atlantic City Surf to the championship during their inaugural season of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in 1998.http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3898863 Edwards was the manager for the San Angelo Colts through 2014, a team in the independent United League Baseball, having managed this team for 6 years.

With more than 140 locations worldwide, the retailer has locations in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, South Korea, China, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Turkey, and United Kingdom. Each month, Club Monaco brings in a new collection, alternating between casual styles during the northern spring and summer and more formal offerings during autumn and winter. Originally, the company was best known for its classic \\"black and white\\" styles, with which different colors are paired, but this is no longer a focus in each collection. Company history In 1985, Canadians Joe Mimran, Saul Mimran and Alfred Sung opened the first store in Toronto on Queen Street West. This store, which still exists today, originally included a cafe below the sales floor. Their second location was in the Promenade Mall in Thornhill. The first US store opened in Santa Monica in 1989. Until 1999, Club Monaco was a Canadian company and was based at Avenue Road and Bloor Street West along the Mink Mile in Toronto. It is now owned and operated by Polo Ralph Lauren, which acquired Club Monaco in 1999. Polo has allowed Club Monaco to exist as an independent entity within the group. Club Monaco originally marketed an image of yachting apparel, strictly designing black and white clothing for men and women. Around 2011, Club Monaco abandoned the black-and-white motif, scaled back the high-fashion tailoring, and entirely eliminated their men's clothing line. Somewhat struggling through an identity crisis, as recently as 2015, Club Monaco further scaled back their designs to their most casual yet and reintroduced a men's line. Recently, Club Monaco has transitioned itself into an international lifestyle brand that offers what it calls \\"affordable luxury with modern sensibility\\". Each store has its own unique concept and design as well as a mix of different products. Third-party brands carried in stores include Ray-Ban sunglasses, Citizens of Humanity jeans, Mackage leather goods and can include a variety of vintage goods from high-end designers such as Chanel and Herm√®s. Club Monaco also contracts with outside designers for products such as jewelry designed by Erickson Beamon and handbags from Jane Mayle. Club Monaco relies heavily on social media to market itself, using sites such as Pinterest and Tumblr to present its \\"lookbooks\\" or \\"inspirations\\" which can also be viewed on their website through their \\"Culture Club\\" page. Luxottica began distributing Club Monaco prescription frames and sunglasses in its retail outlets in 2007. In August 2013, Club Monaco launched their first footwear line consisting of leather flats and heels made in Italy. In the same month, the brand also introduced a higher-end label simply titled 'Collection'. The women's design team is currently headed by Steven Cateron. The men's design team was headed by Aaron Levine until he left for Abercrombie & Fitch.ABERCROMBIE & FITCH HIRES LEAD MEN'S DESIGNER FROM CLUB MONACO DHANI MAU JUN 17, 2015NICK CARVELL, British GQ, AARON LEVINE IS MAKING ABERCROMBIE & FITCH COOL AGAIN.

Caban was an offspring of Club Monaco and Joe Mimran, who was the founder of Club Monaco. In 2000, just after the launch, Club Monaco/Caban was purchased by Ralph Lauren Corporation. It began to lose focus, and Mimran was ousted. In the summer of 2006, Ralph Lauren Corporation closed all of the Caban stores to focus on Club Monaco in the United States. The last store to close was the flagship store on Queen St. West in Toronto. Caban had opened its first lifestyle concept store in Montreal in the historical landmark Laurentian Bank building (located at 777 St. Catherine Street, on the corner of McGill College) on Saturday, December 9, 2000. It closed the branch in 2006, after which Banana Republic opened its flagship Quebec store there.

University of Pennsylvania professor of Urbanism Witold Rybczynski has found that the earliest mention of building bricks for children appears in Maria and R.L. Edgeworth's Practical Education (1798). Called \\"rational toys\\", blocks were intended to teach children about gravity and physics, as well as spatial relationships that allow them to see how many different parts become a whole.Witold Rybczynski, Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture, 2006 In 1837 Friedrich Fr√∂bel invented a preschool educational institution Kindergarten. For that, he designed ten Froebel Gifts based on building blocks principles.

Cole's A book of stories from The Home Treasury included a box of terracotta toy blocks and, in the accompanying pamphlet \\"Architectural Pastime\\", actual blueprints. In 2003 the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong museum in Rochester, New York inducted ABC blocks into their collection, granting it the title of one of America's toys of national significance. Educational benefits Blocks with numbers, letters and pictures *Physical benefits: toy blocks build strength in a child's fingers and hands, and improve eye-hand coordination. They also help educate children in different shapes. *Social benefits: block play encourages children to make friends and cooperate, and is often one of the first experiences a child has playing with others. Blocks are a benefit for the children because they encourage interaction and imagination. Creativity can be a combined action that is important for social play. *Intellectual benefits: children can potentially develop their vocabularies as they learn to describe sizes, shapes, and positions. Math skills are developed through the process of grouping, adding, and subtracting, particularly with standardized blocks, such as unit blocks. Experiences with gravity, balance, and geometry learned from toy blocks also provide intellectual stimulation. *Creative benefits: children receive creative stimulation by making their own designs with blocks.

A gambang, properly called a gambang kayu ('wooden gambang') is a xylophone-like instrument used among peoples of Indonesia and also the southern Philippines in gamelan and kulintang, with wooden bars as opposed to the metallic ones of the more typical metallophones in a gamelan. A largely obsolete instrument, the gambang gangsa, is a similar instrument made with metal bars. Gambang kayu The bars of the instrument are made of a se wood, generally teak. It also found in ironwood (kayu besi). The bars mounted in a deep wooden case that serves as a resonator. Instruments typically have 17-21 keys that are easily removed, and are kept in place by having a hole through which a nail is placed. Generally a full gamelan has two sets, one gambang pelog and the other one gambang slendro. A pair of long thin mallets (tabuh), made of flexible water buffalo horn tipped with felt, are used to play the instrument. Gambangs are generally played in parallel octaves (gembyang). Occasionally, other styles of playing are employed such as playing kempyung which are playing two notes separated by two keys. Unlike most other gamelan instruments, no dampening is required, as the wood does not ring like the metal keys of other instruments. The gambang is used in a number of gamelan ensembles. It is most notable in the Balinese gamelan Gambang. In Javanese wayang, it is used by itself to accompany the dalang in certain chants. Within a full gamelan, it stands out somewhat because of the high speed of playing, and contrasting timbre because of its materials and more because it has a wider melodic range than the other instruments. In Javanese gamelan, the gambang plays cengkok like the other elaborating instruments. However, the repertoire of cengkok for the gambang is more rudimentary than for other instruments (for instance, the gend√©r), and a great deal of variation is accepted. Gambang gangsa The gambang gangsa has a similar construction, although it generally has fewer keys (typically 15) and is thus somewhat smaller. It has largely been replaced by the saron family of instruments. It was formerly thought to have been a forerunner of the one- octave saron, although more recent evidence, including the appearance of the saron in reliefs at Borobudur in the 9th century, indicate that the instruments are of the same age or that the one-octave saron is older. In early 19th century writings on the Javanese gamelan, it seems to have been played like the gambang kayu; that is, as an elaborating instrument. Later, by 1890, it seems to have merely substituted for a saron, and have been restricted to a small range. Mantle Hood associated this use of limited range to a preference for certain octave arrangements of the cadences in various pathet. See also * Gangsa * Gabbang  References  * See, Yee-Seer. (2002).

It is a habitat specialist of short grass in well-watered temperate grasslands. They may move about locally to find ideal situations, often at night. In their tightly grouped flying flocks they resemble plovers. Description A black breast band separates the lapwing's grey head and neck from the white underside. The wing coverts are brown. It has a variable but prominent white forehead patch similar to its near relative, the Senegal lapwing, but in contrast shows a prominent white wingbar in flight, bordered by black remiges. The two species are also separated by their respective habitat preferences, the Senegal lapwing preferring lower, mostly drier locations. Habits and breeding The black-winged lapwing behaves somewhat like the similar-sized but more generally occurring crowned lapwing and the two species sometimes occur in mixed flocks. The leg colour brightens during the spring breeding season, when the birds sometimes move to higher elevations. Males show mutual aggression at this time and establish territories by calling and display flights which may include exaggerated wing beats. A receptive female will follow the male in flight and copulation may follow soon after. The top of a slope in burnt grassland is a favourite location for nesting. The eggs are fairly large and dark in colour. Incubation starts when the clutch of usually 3 is complete. The adults relay one another in shifts of about 90 minutes. Insulating nest lining is added periodically to the well-lined nest until the eggs are half buried. The young hatch in just under a month and require about another month to become self-sufficient. Food and territories Black-winged Lapwing with earthworm in Midmar Nature Reserve Black-winged lapwings hunt termites on the ground, which constitutes a large part of their diet. They also take tenebrionid beetles and ants, and in captivity prefer earthworms and mealworms. Feeding territories of smaller than one hectare are defended by small groups of these birds. Newly found territories are most aggressively defended through vocal and visual threat displays or aerial mobbing. Large groups however form non-territorial flocks when ample habitat is found. Conservation status Human activities impact both positively and negatively on this species; it is not endangered. The black-winged lapwing is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. References # # Hockey P.A.R., Douie C. 1995.

It is based in Delhi and has chapters elsewhere in the country. It has stated its aims to be achieving greater visibility for Dalit issues and holding the state, in the form of its criminal justice system, accountable for its alleged failures.  Operation  Founded in 1998 by Dalit rights and human rights activists in response to a perceived lack of enforcement of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, the NCDHR had chapters in 14 of India's states by 2003. Its early stated aims were to raise visibility of Dalit issues both to an Indian and international audience and to hold the state accountable for its alleged failures to dispense fair justice in the criminal law system. After nearly a decade of existence, the NCDHR established four campaigns, each targeted at a different aspect of alleged discrimination. Called the Dalit Arthik Adhikar Andolan (DAAA), All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch (AIDMAM), National Federation of Dalit Land Rights Movements (NFDLRM) and National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) these strands were, according to the Rafto Foundation, respectively intended to address: * promotion of economic, social, educational and cultural rights * promotion of the rights of Dalit women, who often suffer double discrimination as Dalits and as women, and caste-based violence * coordination of efforts to secure land rights and livelihoods for Dalits, and to secure proper legal responses and financial remedies for survivor and victims of violence and other violations * documentation and mitigation of the vulnerability of Dalits in disaster preparedness and response Around the same time, the NCDHR began to identify, promote and support co-operation between other Dalit-operated organisations. Shortly after adopting this organisational structure, in 2009, the National Dalit Watch (NDW) was set up. It followed from an extensive study conducted on the 2004 tsunami and later of massive flooding in Bihar (2007‚Äì08), which NCDHR said highlighted caste-based discrimination in rescue programmes during disasters. Since its inception, various tools and methods have been designed to identify, expose and document caste-based discrimination and used the experiences of the people to influence disaster management guidelines by central government.  Recognition  The NCDHR was awarded the Rafto Prize in 2007 for its work promoting Dalit rights and for kindling conversations about the issue internationally. It has worked internationally with organisations such as the United Nations and the International Dalit Solidarity Network.

They hail from Limerick near the banks of the Shannon river. Shannon RFC is a member of the Irish Rugby Football Union Munster Branch. The club is one of the top amateur sides in Ireland has seen many of its players progress to professional and international rugby. The 1st XV plays in Division 1B of the All-Ireland League. History Shannon was founded on the 18 February 1884, in the Shamrock Bar, a Pub by the old Park Bridge, Corbally Road, Limerick. The founder members were Paddy Lynch, Dan Duggan, Richie Gleeson, Pierce Hartney and Joe Hegarty. Paddy Lynch captained the first Shannon team and Stephan Hanrahan was president of the club for the first two years of its existence. Shannon remained a junior club for the best part of 70 years, during which time Shannon supplied numerous players to Garryowen's successful senior sides. Shannon won the Munster Junior Cup for the first of many times in 1914. Their first Transfield cup was won in 1938. The following year, the Munster Junior Cup was won again. One year later (1940), in the process of winning their first Charity Cup, they added both the Munster Junior Cup and Transfield Cup. Shannon's consistent success as a junior club eventually led to the club attaining senior status in the 1953-54 season, becoming Limerick's fifth senior club. It was not until 1960 that Shannon won their first Munster Senior Cup, defeating University College Cork, 6-3 in a replay at Thomond Park, having drawn 8-8 the previous week at Musgrave Park, Cork. Over the years, since the club's inception, Shannon have had numerous temporary grounds, among them the field at the Island Bank, Gilligan's field, Johnny Cusack's field and Egan's Field on the Mill Rd. in Corbally. The first purchased grounds were of land at Fir Hill, Gortatogher, (better known as Athlunkard) just two miles (3 km) from Limerick city. However, a few years ago, it was determined that this was not big enough, so it was sold to Corbally Utd. soccer club in favour of our current more spacious grounds at Coonagh off the Ennis Road. Shannon currently have 3 training pitches there, floodlights and newly built dressing rooms, and are developing two more pitches. While still a junior club, Shannon became co-tenants with Bohemians RFC at the Munster RFU-owned grounds at famed Thomond Park. In 1967, they completed their own Club Pavilion there. In 1978, the Pavilion was extended to the size it is today. A milestone in the history of the club was the celebration of their centenary in 1984.

Its name translates from Latin as 'The Rope'. It is a comedy, which describes how a girl, Palaestra, stolen from her parents by pirates, is reunited with her father, Daemones, ironically, by means of her pimp, Labrax. The story is, however, far more complex; in particular, humour is derived from the interactions between slaves and masters, and the changes in friendships throughout. The play is set in Cyrene, in northern Africa, although the characters come from a range of cities around the Mediterranean, most notably, Athens. The story Rudens is introduced by a prologue given by Arcturus, before the play properly opens with a dialogue between Daemones, an elderly Athenian man, and his slave, Sceparnio; Sceparnio's cheekiness towards his master, who seems to lack the strength to contest this behaviour, is the provision of humour from the outset. Shortly after this, a young Athenian man called Plesidippus appears onstage, to seek information politely from Daemones. The interaction between slave and master (or rather, stranger) is shown again, as Sceparnio gives Plesidippus an extremely cold reception, showing his rudeness but also, possibly, his care for Daemones, seemingly protecting him from a stranger. After some argument (indirectly) between Sceparnio and Plesidippus, the latter finally asks Daemones (by way of a physical description) whether he has seen Labrax recently at the temple of Venus, which is nearby, on the coast of Cyrene, Libya. He also describes Labrax as bringing with him two girls, who are later to be named as Ampelisca and Palaestra. Suddenly, Daemones is drawn away from the conversation with Plesidippus, noticing two men, shipwrecked, attempting to swim towards the shore; Plesidippus immediately leaves with his friends, in the hope that one of them might be Labrax. After he has left, the scene develops, with Sceparnio spotting a boat in the turbulent sea, containing two girls. He engages in a detailed commentary of the girls being knocked around on the sea, and then being thrown out. Daemones, however, growing tired of the events, sharply tells Sceparnio that, should he wish to dine at his master's expense, he should get back to work. The play shifts, then, to the two girls who were thrown out of the boat, into the sea, and subsequently separated. It opens with the first girl, Palaestra, lamenting her situation; she first focuses on the fact that she is in an unknown country, and that the gods have punished her unjustly, before being troubled by her loneliness. Indeed, she suggests that her ordeal would be less awful if her companion, Ampelisca, were with her. Elsewhere on the coast, Ampelisca is similarly upset; however, her reaction is one more resembling absolute despair. She states that she wishes to die, and that she has nothing to live for; nevertheless, she is driven to continue by the prospect that her friend might be alive. Ampelisca's soliloquy is cut short, when Palaestra hears a voice. After some consideration and careful listening, the girls realise that they have heard each other's voices, and follow them. Finally, the two girls turn around a rock and meet each other, grasping each other's hands with joy. With nowhere to go, the girls can see only the temple of Venus in the distance, and so decide to go in that direction. Outside the temple, the girls pray desperately to its god (note that, at this point, they do not know that the temple is that of Venus, or even of a goddess), so loudly, in fact, that the priestess, Ptolemocratia, is drawn outside. The priestess speaks in a rather pompous tone, asking the girls why they have turned up to the temple so poorly dressed, seemingly disregarding the fact that they have been shipwrecked. However, Palaestra's desperate pleas for mercy and supplication soon soften her spirit, and, after complaining that she has barely enough resources to look after herself, she states that she has a moral duty to do what little she can to help the girls, and accordingly invites them into the temple. The focus shifts to a group of fishermen, singing about their poor lives. Plesidippus' slave Trachalio enters the scene, and rudely asks where he can find his master. Having stated that they have seen neither Plesidippus nor Labrax, they leave. Labrax had stated that he would meet Plesidippus for dinner at the temple of Venus (explaining why Plesidippus was speaking to Daemones at the start of the play), and would discuss the girls there. Because neither Labrax nor Plesidippus can be found, Trachalio comes to the conclusion that his master has been cheated by the pimp, who was actually shipwrecked and so was not able to meet Plesidippus; Trachalio states that he had predicted this, and comically proclaims that he is a soothsayer. On his way to the temple, to seek information from the priestess, Trachalio walks into Ampelisca, who is going to a nearby cottage (Daemones') to fetch water. Trachalio states that he recognises the girl, and Ampelisca recognises him; they enter into a friendly conversation, with Trachalio explaining that his master cannot be found and that Labrax has cheated him. Fuelling his ego, Ampelisca, too, states that he is a soothsayer, introducing further humour. Ampelisca refers to Palaestra being with her, the mention of whom prompts Trachalio to state that she is his master's girl. The conversation continues, as Trachalio obviously, but sweetly, flirts with Ampelisca who, apparently flattered, replies in similar ways; this gives further humour: while Plesidippus was negotiating the terms of buying Palaestra (his girl, according to Trachalio), Trachalio was forming a relationship with Labrax's other girl and Palaestra's friend, Ampelisca. Trachalio's wit is obvious soon after, explaining a rather complex logical argument to explain how Labrax could not have been caught by Plesidippus. Towards the end of this scene, Ampelisca states that Palaestra's misery is being caused by the fact that she has lost a chest, in the shipwreck, containing articles which would identify her to her parents, should she ever find them again; this becomes extremely important later in the play. Trachalio leaves the scene, entering the temple to speak to Palaestra. Ampelisca continues with her task, and knocks on the cottage door to get water. Sceparnio, Daemones'wa slave answers, and is delighted to see a woman ‚Äî hardly the behavior of a slave, and thus another source of humor. Indeed, he interrupts her to suggest that it would be more appropriate for her to call again in the evening. He is given an extremely cold reception by Ampelisca, who is keen to complete her work. Incredibly, Sceparnio then announces that he is the resident priest, and that Ampelisca must speak to him nicely to get what she wants ‚Äî an outrageous statement to be made by a slave. Finally, Ampelisca, tired of arguing, agrees to do whatever he wants, and so Sceparnio scurries away to fill her jug with water. However, after he leaves, Ampelisca looks out at the sea and notices, on the shore, two men, whom she instantly realizes as being Labrax and his friend, Charmides. Terrified, she retreats back to the temple to tell Palaestra and to seek safety. Meanwhile, Sceparnio is returning with the filled jug, convinced that Ampelisca is deeply in love with him. When he does not see her, he presumes that she is playfully hiding, before his mood becomes more sour, until he gets tired of searching. However, worried that he would be in great trouble for leaving the jug, elaborately decorated, unattended, he takes it into the temple himself. The emphasis shifts to Labrax and Charmides on the shore. They pointlessly argue for some time, blaming one another for the current situation; they suspect that the girls are both dead and that Plesidippus will not be happy, since he had paid a deposit for Palaestra. Suddenly, they come across Sceparnio, now leaving the temple, and wondering why two women are there, crying. Hearing this, Labrax interrogates Sceparnio, realising that they are Ampelisca and Palaestra; his continual questioning annoys Sceparnio, who is then cheekily asked by Labrax whether he can provide them with a place to stay. Sceparnio does not oblige, but does offer to dry their clothes ‚Äî an offer which Charmides refuses. The scene ends as Charmides enters the temple to seek shelter. Shortly after, Daemones emerges from his cottage, explaining a dream he had had about being attacked by a monkey, trying to climb a tree to get to a swallow's nest, because he did not lend the monkey a ladder; like the audience at this stage, he has no idea what the dream meant. He hears a great noise from inside the temple, and then sees Trachalio running out, exclaiming incomprehensible pleas for help. Trachalio hysterically approaches Daemones, begging for help in the same complex way, but still making no sense to the latter. Finally, he explains that two girls and the priestess are being attacked in the temple; he expands on this, explaining that a man (known to the audience as Labrax) is trying to take the girls, clinging to the altar, away. Being a decent man, Daemones calls upon two strong slaves, Turbalio and Sparax, to go into the temple to help them; Palaestra and Ampelisca leave the temple. Having been found by the pimp, from whom she thought she was now safe, Palaestra despairs, asking what will become of herself and Ampelisca now; once again, she states that it would be better for them to die. Suddenly, the girls notice Trachalio, giving them some hope; however, despite Trachalio's reassurances, both girls insist that they are intent on suicide. Trachalio tells the girls to wait at the altar outside the temple, where both he and Venus will ensure their safety. Ampelisca prays to Venus for this protection, joined by Trachalio who begs for the goddess to help them both. Daemones then emerges from the temple, along with Turbalio and Sparax, bring Labrax. Another, more violent side of Daemones is seen: he insults Labrax, and instructs one of his slaves to punch him. Nevertheless, Labrax remains defiant, stating that he will have his revenge against Daemones and that the girls are, at least by the law of his own country, his property. However, Trachalio interjects, insisting that if any Cyrenian judge were summoned, he would agree that the girls should be free and that Labrax should spend the rest of his life in prison. Labrax responds harshly to having a slave arguing with him, continuing to speak to Daemones. However, seemingly enjoying the exchange between Trachalio and Labrax, Daemones orders the pimp to continue his argument with the slave. Finally, Labrax is defeated in his resolve, and converses with Trachalio, who threatens that even the slightest touch of the girls will result in him being beaten. Greedy as always, Labrax states that Trachalio may have the girls, but only if he is willing to pay, and indeed that Venus could have them if she were to pay. Daemones is outraged at the idea of Venus ever giving money to a pimp, and threatens him with further violence with even the slightest offense against them. Suddenly, Trachalio states that one of the girls is Greek, and has Athenian parents, which interests Daemones, realising that she is of the same nationality as him. This brings back the memories of his lost daughter, stating that she was only three years old when she was stolen by pirates, and that she would now be as old as Palaestra if she were still alive (not realising yet that Palaestra is his daughter). Trachalio then suggests that, to determine whether he or Labrax is more honest, they should compare each other's backs for blisters from whipping for crimes; he believes that Labrax' back will be covered with more blisters than a warship has bolts, and that his will be smooth enough for a bottle-maker to execute his art. Labrax takes no notice of the threats, and makes for the cottage, stating that he intends to fetch Vulcan (representative of fire), since he is an enemy of Venus. One of the two slaves makes a humorous comment, that there will be no fire in the house since they are allowed to eat nothing but dried figs. This is ignored, and Labrax explains his plan to build a fire with which to kill the girls; however, Daemones suggests that Labrax is burnt instead. Trachalio decides to leave to fetch his master, Plesidippus, to whom Labrax had sold Palaestra; his exit is slow, as he continually reminds Daemones to watch Labrax carefully. After Trachalio has left, Daemones toys with Labrax, telling him to go and touch the girls. This carries on for some time, until Daemones sends one of his slaves, Turbalio, into the cottage to fetch two clubs. On his return, Daemones carefully positions both slaves around the pimp, instructing them as to exactly how they should hold the clubs, threatening absolutely that any attempt to touch them whatsoever will result in their death, stressing also that he is not allowed to leave. Daemones then leaves to return to the cottage. Labrax is left alone with the two slaves behind him. He jokes about the fact that, although the temple had formerly been Venus‚Äô, the presence of the two heavy-handed slaves with their clubs, makes it seem that it is now Hercules‚Äô. Having called out to Palaestra, Sparax answers, asking what he wants ‚Äì Labrax is familiarly rude. Testing their patience, he asks whether he can move closer to the girls, but is threatened with the clubs; the slaves toy with him, encouraging him to move forward. Trachalio returns, with his master, Plesidippus. Despite Trachalio‚Äôs diligent efforts to protect the girls and his hate for Labrax, he is berated by his master for not having killed the pimp; quite surprisingly, Trachalio shows significant mercy towards Labrax, appealing at Plesidippus‚Äô suggestion that he should have killed the pimp ‚Äòlike a dog‚Äô. Labrax greets Plesidippus cheekily, but it is received with contempt. Plesidippus sends Trachalio to fetch the men who had accompanied him in the first instance, when meeting Daemones and Sceparnio, leaving, essentially, just Plesidippus and Labrax. Labrax questions Plesidippus, asking with which crime he is being charged; he then states that he cannot be charged, since he did not actually take the girls away ‚Äì he just took them some of the way, hindered by the storm. Tired of the banter, Plesidippus throws a rope around Labrax‚Äôs neck and orders him to march with him to the magistrate. As they walk past, Labrax‚Äôs friend, Charmides, emerges from the temple, at Labrax‚Äôs calls for help. Expecting to receive assistance from his friend, Labrax asks him why he is failing to act; Charmides ignores his former friend, and instead congratulates Plesidippus, and then tells Labrax that he is getting exactly what he deserves. As he is led off, the girls are brought into the safety of Daemones‚Äô cottage, and Charmides, in soliloquy, states humorously that he intends to testify at the court‚Ä¶for the prosecution. Daemones emerges from his cottage, again in soliloquy, stating what a good job he has done in saving the two girls, and how beautiful he considers the two girls, in his protection, to be. This leads onto his wife, who is now intently watching him, mistrustful of his fidelity. He refers to his slave, Gripus, who is a fisherman whom he sent out the last night to fish. He is late, and Daemones doubts that, given the severity of the storm, he could have caught anything. The scene switches to Gripus, alone, carrying his net behind him; his mood is unusually raised considering that he could not have caught much. However, he soon states that his net is heavy because of gift from Neptune and furthermore, that he hasn‚Äôt caught a single fish. Gripus explains how he has been blessed with his prized catch because of his diligence, and then reveals that what he has caught is a wooden trunk ‚Äî because of its weight, he presumes that it is filled with gold, and gets carried away imagining that he can buy his own freedom and become rich and famous. He drags off the trunk to hide it, when Trachalio calls him. Despite Gripus' assumption that he has come looking for fish, Trachalio insists that he only wishes to speak with him, while carefully examining the contents of the net. Trachalio begins to explain his interest in Gripus' catch. Trachalio explains that he knows the owner of the trunk, and that it should be returned ‚Äî Gripus takes no notice, arguing that it is his property now. He justifies his cause by using the example of a fish ‚Äî a fish in the sea cannot belong to anyone, but once it has been caught, it is the property of the fisherman. Trachalio, showing his quick-wit, states that if he is correct, the trunk is as much his as it is Gripus'. The argument becomes increasingly obscure as Trachalio demands in which way a trunk can be treated in the same way as a fish, to which Gripus states that there is such thing as a trunk- fish. Trachalio becomes sick of the argument, and instead suggests that they seek an arbitrator to make a decision ‚Äî characteristic of Gripus, he suggests a tug of war ‚Äî an idea much scorned by Trachalio. Humorously, Trachalio threatens to punch Gripus (even though the latter is obviously far stronger); a similar threat from Gripus makes him back down quickly, offering a 50:50 share of the trunk. A failed attempt by Trachalio to carry off the trunk leads to more argument; Gripus quickly gives up, lacking the wit to keep up with Trachalio. There is a final futile attempt by Gripus to win the trunk by reasoning, suggesting that if Trachalio leaves him with the trunk, he will not be an accessory to the crime. Trachalio finally suggests that the man living in the nearby cottage (Daemones) should act as the arbitrator; to himself, Gripus utters that he cannot lose the trunk now, presuming that his master will side with him. The scene moves to the entrance of the cottage, where Daemones has been forced, by his jealous wife, to let the girls go from the house ‚Äî Ampelisca and Palaestra are despairing once again. Gripus and Trachalio arrive at the cottage and greet Daemones, when, upon hearing that Gripus is Daemones' slave, Trachalio is astounded. However, he speaks politely to Daemones, greeting him, and then, surprisingly, stating how excellent it is that they are master and slave. Gripus and Trachalio enter into a childish race to give their side of the story first ‚Äî to the audience's (and Gripus') surprise, Daemones gives Trachalio the right to speak first ‚Äî after a brief explanation that the trunk belongs to Labrax, they quarrel again. Daemones appears to be watching the spectacle as a comic event, commenting on the wit of either side and laughing at insults hurled by each of them. Trachalio continues the story by stating that he does not claim anything in the trunk, and that he instead wishes to return an item to Palaestra ‚Äî a box containing toys from when she was a baby. Instantly, Daemones agrees that he should have the box, despite an appeal from Gripus that they might be gold. However, showing absolute devotion to the girls, he states that he will pay Gripus in gold for whatever he takes from the trunk ‚Äî despite not having the means. Trachalio then proposes that Palaestra should be made to recognise the box, to make sure that he is correct; Gripus protests again. Daemones asks Trachalio to explain the story again, invoking considerable annoyance, and even more with an interruption from Gripus. Finally, Gripus hands the trunk over to Daemones, on condition that anything not belonging to the girls he can keep. Daemones asks the girls whether the trunk is that in which the box of trinkets was kept ‚Äî they confirm it, and Gripus, cynical, states that they did not even look at it. Palaestra counters this by telling Daemones to look inside the trunk and box, while she describes all the contents. As Palaestra recognizes the box, she exclaims that her parents are in there, which Gripus comically takes literally, stating that she will be punished for imprisoning her parents in a box. They begin the proof of ownership, as Palaestra describes the toys in the box; the first is a small golden sword with an inscription, \\"Daemones,\\" which she states is her father's name. Daemones begins to realize the truth ‚Äî that Palaestra is his daughter. The next is a small axe with another inscription ‚Äî Daedalis ‚Äî the name of Palaestra's mother and of Daemones' wife. The scene erupts into three simultaneous soliloquies ‚Äî Daemones exclaiming his joy at finding his daughter, Gripus lamenting the loss of the articles in the trunk, Palaestra continuing to describe the items in the box. Finally, this is broken when Daemones states that he is her father, and that her mother is just inside the house. Trachalio congratulates Daemones, and they all ‚Äî except for Gripus ‚Äî enter the house. Gripus laments his loss, suggesting that he should just hang himself. The play moves on by a few hours, as Daemones leaves his cottage, talking to himself about his good fortune and his intention to marry his new-found daughter to Plesidippus.

The borough was founded by royal charter in 1207 by King John, was made up of only seven streets in the shape of the letter 'H' but Liverpool remained a small settlement until its trade with Ireland and coastal parts of England and Wales was overtaken by trade with Africa and the West Indies, which included the slave trade. The world's first wet dock was opened in 1715 and Liverpool's expansion to become a major city continued over the next two centuries. By the start of the nineteenth century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool. In 1830, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was opened. The population grew rapidly, especially with Irish migrants; by 1851, one quarter of the city's population was Irish-born. As growth continued, the city became known as \\"the second city of the Empire\\", and was also called \\"the New York of Europe\\". During the Second World War, the city was the centre for planning the crucial Battle of the Atlantic, and suffered a blitz second only to London's. From the mid- twentieth century, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into sharp decline, with the advent of containerisation making the city's docks obsolete. The unemployment rate in Liverpool rose to one of the highest in the UK. Over the same period, starting in the early 1960s, the city became internationally renowned for its culture, particularly as the centre of the \\"Merseybeat\\" sound which became synonymous with The Beatles. In recent years, Liverpool's economy has recovered, partly due to tourism as well as substantial investment in regeneration schemes. The city was the European Capital of Culture for 2008. Origins of the name The name comes from the Old English liver, meaning thick or muddy, and pol, meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as Liuerpul. According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, \\"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\\". The adjective Liverpudlian is first recorded in 1833. Early history of the area The ancient neolithic Calder Stones on display in the Harthill Greenhouses In the Iron Age the area around modern-day Liverpool was sparsely populated, though there was a seaport at Meols. The Calderstones are thought to be part of an ancient stone circle and there is archaeological evidence for native Iron Age farmsteads at several sites in Irby, Halewood and Lathom. The region was inhabited by Brythonic tribes, the Setantii as well as nearby Cornovii and Deceangli. It came under Roman influence in about 70 AD, with the northward advance to crush the druid resistance at Anglesey and to end the internal strife between the ruling family of Brigantes. The main Roman presence was at the fortress and settlement at Chester. According to Ptolemy, the Latin hydronym for the Mersey was Seteia Aestuarium, which derives from the Setantii tribe. In 2007, evidence of a Roman Tile works was found around the Tarbock Island area of the M62 and various Roman coins and Jewellery have been found in the Liverpool area. After the withdrawal of Roman troops, land in the area continued to be farmed by native Britons. The Hen Ogledd (Old North) was subject to fighting between four medieval kingdoms: the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Mercia eventually defeated its rival Northumbria as well as the Celtic kingdoms of Gwynedd and Powys, with the Battle of Brunanburh perhaps taking place at nearby Bromborough. The settlements at Walton (Wealas tun meaning 'farmstead of the Wealas'), and Wallasey (Wealas-eg meaning 'island of the Wealas') were named at this time with Wealas being Old English for 'foreigner' referring to the native Celtic and Romanized inhabitants. The pseudo- historical Fragmentary Annals of Ireland appears to record the Norse settlement of the Wirral in its account of the immigration of Ingimundr near Chester. This Irish source places this settlement in the aftermath of the Vikings' expulsion from Dublin in 902, and an unsuccessful attempt to settle on Anglesey soon afterwards. Following these setbacks, Ingimundr is stated to have settled near Chester with the consent of √Üthelfl√¶d, co-ruler of Mercia. The Norse settlers eventually joined up with another group of Viking settlers who populated west Lancashire, and for a time had an independent Viking mini- state, with Viking placenames evident all over Merseyside. The Norse colony was governed at assembly places called √æing (pronounced thing) on each side of the Mersey, at Thingwall in Wirral and also Thingwall of West Derby, and the area eventually became subject to the Danelaw. Origins of the town W. Ferguson Irvine's conjectural plan of Liverpool's original 7 streets West Derby Castle shown where it used to stand. (circa 1200) Although a small motte and bailey castle had earlier been built at West Derby, the origins of the city of Liverpool are usually dated from 28 August 1207, when letters patent were issued by King John advertising the establishment of a new borough, \\"Livpul\\", and inviting settlers to come and take up holdings there. It is thought that the King wanted a port in the district that was free from the control of the Earl of Chester. Initially it served as a dispatch point for troops sent to Ireland, soon after the building around 1235 of Liverpool Castle, which was removed in 1726. St Nicholas Church was built by 1257, originally as a chapel within the parish of Walton-on-the-Hill. In the 13th Century, Liverpool as an area comprised just seven streets. With the formation of a market on the site of the later Town Hall, Liverpool became established as a small fishing and farming community, administered by burgesses and, slightly later, a mayor. There was probably some coastal trade around the Irish Sea, and there were occasional ferries across the Mersey. However, for several centuries it remained a small and relatively unimportant settlement, with a population of no more than 1,000 in the mid 14th century. By the early fifteenth century a period of economic decline set in, and the county gentry increased their power over the town, the Stanley family fortifying their house by building Stanley Tower on Water Street. This was a catalyst for a feud between the Stanley and Molyneux families since the Molyneux family had permission to live at the nearby Liverpool Castle at that time. The resulting rivalry nearly spilled into a riot in 1424. In the middle of the 16th century the population of Liverpool had fallen to around 600, and the port was regarded as subordinate to Chester until the 1650s. Elizabethan era and the Civil War Liverpool in 1572. In 1571 the people of Liverpool sent a memorial to Queen Elizabeth, praying relief from a subsidy which they thought themselves unable to bear, wherein they styled themselves \\"her majesty's poor decayed town of Liverpool.\\" Some time towards the close of this reign, Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby, on his way to the Isle of Man, stayed at his house, the Tower; at which the corporation erected a handsome hall or seat for him in the church, where he honoured them several times with his presence. By the end of the sixteenth century, the town began to be able to take advantage of economic revival and the silting of the River Dee to win trade, mainly from Chester, to Ireland, the Isle of Man and elsewhere. In 1626, King Charles I gave the town a new and improved charter. Liverpool in 1650. In June 1644 Prince Rupert of the Rhine arrived in Liverpool with 10,000 men in an attempt to capture Liverpool Castle. A sixteen-day siege of Liverpool then took place. To defend the city the Parliament Army created a huge trench across much of the town centre. Prince Rupert eventually took hold of the Castle only to be driven out again to take refuge in the Everton area of the city, hence the name of the tower found on the modern day Everton Football Club badge is known as Prince Rupert's Tower. Transatlantic trade The first cargo from the Americas was recorded in 1648. The development of the town accelerated after the Restoration of 1660, with the growth of trade with America and the West Indies. From that time may be traced the rapid progress of population and commerce, until Liverpool had become the second metropolis of Great Britain. Initially, cloth, coal and salt from Lancashire and Cheshire were exchanged for sugar and tobacco; the town's first sugar refinery was established in 1667.http://www.mawer.clara.net/loc-liverpool.html In 1699 Liverpool was made a parish on its own by Act of Parliament, separate from that of Walton-on-the- Hill, with two parish churches. At the same time it gained separate customs authority from Chester. Slavery On 3 October 1699, the very same year that Liverpool had been granted status as an independent parish, Liverpool's first 'recorded' slave ship, named Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa, arriving in Barbados with a 'cargo' of 220 Africans, returning to Liverpool on 18 September 1700. The following month a second recorded ship, The Blessing, set sail for the Gold Coast. The first commercial wet dock in Britain was built in Liverpool and completed in 1715. It was the first in the world and was constructed for a capacity of 100 ships. By the close of the 18th century 40% of the world's, and 80% of Britain's Atlantic slave activity was accounted for by slave ships that voyaged from the docks at Liverpool. This growth led to the opening of the Consulate of the United States in Liverpool in 1790, its first consulate anywhere in the world. Vast profits from the slave trade transformed Liverpool into one of Britain's foremost important cities. Liverpool became a financial centre, rivalled by Bristol, another slaving port, and beaten only by London. In the peak year of 1799, ships sailing from Liverpool carried over 45,000 slaves from Africa. Many factors led to the demise of slavery including revolts, piracy, social unrest, and the repercussions of corruption such as slave insurance fraud, e.g. the Zong massacre case in 1783. It was Liverpool born politician William Roscoe who spearheaded the anti-Slavery movement in parliament at the time. Slavery in British colonies was finally abolished in 1833 and slave trading was made illegal in 1807 though some slavery apprenticeships ran until 1838. However, many merchants managed to ignore the laws and continued to deal in underground slave trafficking, also underhandedly engaging in financial investments for slaving activities in the Americas. Industrial revolution and commercial expansion The dock system in 1832 Albert Dock The international trade of the city grew, based, as well as on slaves, on a wide range of commodities - including, in particular, cotton, for which the city became the leading world market, supplying the textile mills of Manchester and Lancashire. During the eighteenth century the town's population grew from some 6,000 to 80,000, and its land and water communications with its hinterland and other northern cities steadily improved. Liverpool was first linked by canal to Manchester in 1721, the St. Helens coalfield in 1755, and Leeds in 1816. In 1830, Liverpool became home to the world's first inter-urban rail link to another city, Manchester, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the maiden journey Stephenson's The Rocket train. Liverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the Liverpool Overhead Railway, which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both New York City and Chicago. The built-up area grew rapidly from the eighteenth century on. The Bluecoat Hospital for poor children opened in 1718. With the demolition of the castle in 1726, only St Nicholas Church and the historic street plan - with Castle Street as the spine of the original settlement, and Paradise Street following the line of the Pool - remained to reflect the town's mediaeval origins. The Town Hall, with a covered exchange for merchants designed by architect John Wood, was built in 1754, and the first office buildings including the Corn Exchange were opened in about 1810. Throughout the 19th century Liverpool's trade and its population continued to expanded rapidly. Growth in the cotton trade was accompanied by the development of strong trading links with India and the Far East following the ending of the East India Company's monopoly in 1813. Over of new docks, with of quay space, were opened between 1824 and 1858. Map of Liverpool from 1880 During the 1840s, Irish migrants began arriving by the thousands due to the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì1849. Almost 300,000 arrived in the year 1847 alone, and by 1851 approximately 25% of the city was Irish-born. The Irish influence is reflected in the unique place Liverpool occupies in UK and Irish political history, being the only place outside Ireland to elect a member of parliament from the Irish Parliamentary Party to the British parliament in Westminster. T.P. O'Connor represented the constituency of Liverpool Scotland from 1885 to 1929. As the town became a leading port of the British Empire, a number of major buildings were constructed, including St. George's Hall (1854), and Lime Street Station. The Grand National steeplechase was first run at Aintree in 1837. Between 1851 and 1911, Liverpool attracted at least 20,000 people from Wales in each decade, peaking in the 1880s, and Welsh culture flourished. One of the first Welsh language journals, Yr Amserau, was founded in Liverpool by William Rees (Gwilym Hiraethog), and there were over 50 Welsh chapels in the city. Early regular scheduled Liverpool transatlantic passenger travel began in the 1810s with American lines such as Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet) and Collins Line and in the 1840s with Liverpool-based companies' lines Cunard Line and White Star Line continuing throughout the 19th Century. When the American Civil War broke out Liverpool became a hotbed of intrigue. The prevalence of cotton and slave interests in Liverpool ensured that the city was, in the words of the historian Sven Beckert, \\"the most pro- Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\\" The Confederate Navy ship, the CSS Alabama, was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey and the CSS Shenandoah surrendered there (being the final surrender and end of the war). Liverpool was granted city status in 1880, and the following year its university was established. By 1901, the city's population had grown to over 700,000, and its boundaries had expanded to include Kirkdale, Everton, Walton, West Derby (in 1835 and 1895), Toxteth and Garston. 20th century =1900-1938= By 1957, the once-great Liverpool tramway system had been reduced to just two routes, the 6A to Bowring Park and the 40 to Page Moss Avenue. These routes finally closed in September. All were in a run-down and dilapidated condition, sad to see. Here is a 'Baby Grand' 4-wheel tram on the Bowring Park route. MV Britannic (1929) thumb Queens Drive, Walton, Liverpool, pictured in 1909 During the first part of the 20th century Liverpool continued to expand, pulling in immigrants from Europe. In 1903 an International Exhibition took place in Edge Lane. In 1904, the building of the Anglican Cathedral began, and by 1916 the three Pier Head buildings, including the Liver Building, were complete. This period marked the pinnacle of Liverpool's economic success, when it regarded itself as the \\"second city\\" of the British Empire. The formerly independent urban districts of Allerton, Childwall, Little Woolton and Much Woolton were added in 1913, and the parish of Speke added in 1932, with large housing developments, mostly by the local authority, being built over the next few years. Adolf Hitler's half-brother Alois and his Irish sister-in-law Bridget Dowling are known to have lived in Upper Stanhope Street in the 1910s. Bridget's alleged memoirs, which surfaced in the 1970s, said that Adolf stayed with them in 1912‚Äì13, although this is much disputed as many believe the memoirs to be a forgery. The maiden voyage of Titanic in April 1912 was originally planned to depart from Liverpool, as Liverpool was its port of registration and the home of owners White Star Line. However, it was changed to depart from Southampton instead. Aside from the large Irish community in Liverpool, there were other pockets of cultural diversity. The area of Gerard, Hunter, Lionel and Whale streets, off Scotland Road, was referred to as Little Italy. Inspired by an old Venetian custom, Liverpool was 'married to the sea' in September 1928. Liverpool was also home to a large Welsh population, and was sometimes referred to as the Capital of North Wales. In 1884, 1900 and 1929, Eisteddfods were held in Liverpool. The population of the city peaked at over 850,000 in the 1930s. Economic changes began in the first part of the 20th century, as falls in world demand for the North West's traditional export commodities contributed to stagnation and decline in the city. Unemployment was well above the national average as early as the 1920s, and the city became known nationally for its occasionally violent religious sectarianism. When Everton F.C. won the Football League First Division title in 1928, their centre-forward Dixie Dean scored a Football League record of 60 goals in the same season. The Great Depression hit Liverpool badly in the early 1930s with thousands of people in the city left unemployed. This was combated by a large amount of housing mostly built by the local council being constructed, creating jobs mostly in the building, plumbing and electrical trades. About 15 per cent of the city's population were rehoused in the 1920s and 1930s with more than 30,000 new council houses being built to replace the slums in the city. The rising popularity of motor cars led to congestion in the city, and in 1934 the city gained its first direct road link with the Wirral Peninsula, when the first Mersey Tunnel road was opened. The Queensway, as the new tunnel was named, linked Liverpool with Birkenhead at the other side of the Mersey. Many other buildings were built in the city in the 1930s to ease the depression and became local landmarks, with many buildings featuring American inspired architecture. =1939-1945: World War II= During World War 2, Liverpool was the control centre for the Battle of the Atlantic. There were eighty air-raids on Merseyside, with an especially concentrated series of raids in May 1941 which interrupted operations at the docks for almost a week. Some 2,500 people were killed,Some sources state 4,000 almost half the homes in the metropolitan area sustained some damage and some 11,000 were totally destroyed. Over 70,000 people were made homeless. John Lennon, one of the founding members of The Beatles, was born in Liverpool during an air-raid on 9 October 1940. All four members of The Beatles were born in the city during the war, rising to fame in the early 1960s. =1946-1979= Tree stumps exposed by low water level of reservoir, at Capel Celyn, a Welsh village flooded to provide water for Liverpool. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. However, the city has been suffering since the 1950s with the loss of numerous employers. By 1985 the population had fallen to 460,000. Declines in manufacturing and dock activity struck the city particularly hard. In 1956 Liverpool Overhead Railway and its fourteen stations were closed and demolished and in 1957 Liverpool Corporation Tramways closed after the last tram ran in Liverpool. In 1955, the Labour Party, led locally by Jack and Bessie Braddock, came to power in the City Council for the first time. In 1956, a private bill sponsored by Liverpool City Council was brought before Parliament to develop a water reservoir from the Tryweryn Valley. The development would include the flooding of Capel Celyn. By obtaining authority via an Act of Parliament, Liverpool City Council would not require planning consent from the relevant Welsh Local Authorities. This, together with the fact that the village was one of the last Welsh-only speaking communities, ensured that the proposals became deeply controversial. Thirty five out of thirty six Welsh Members of Parliament (MPs) opposed the bill (the other did not vote), but in 1957 it was passed. The members of the community waged an eight-year effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to prevent the destruction of their homes, which finally occurred in 1965. The incident led to a massive rise in Welsh nationalism, and a year later, Gwynfor Evans of Plaid Cymru won the party's first seat in the Carmathen by-election. In the 1960s Liverpool became a centre of youth culture. The city produced the distinctive Merseybeat sound, most famously The Beatles, and the Liverpool poets. From the 1970s onwards Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into further sharp decline. The advent of containerisation meant that Liverpool's docks ceased to be a major local employer. Liverpool Central High Level railway station closed in 1972, as well as the Waterloo, Victoria and Wapping tunnels. In 1974, Liverpool became a metropolitan district within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside. In 1977 Liverpool Exchange railway station closed, and in 1979 the North Liverpool Extension Line closed too. In 1972 Canadian Pacific unit CP Ships were the last transatlantic line to operate from Liverpool. =1980s= The 1980s saw Liverpool's fortunes sink to their lowest postwar point. Although the 1970s, along with the rest of Britain, had brought economic difficulties and a steady rise in unemployment, the situation in Liverpool went from bad to worse in the early 1980s, with endless factory closures and some of the highest unemployment rates in the UK. An average of 12,000 people each year were leaving the city, and 15% of its land was vacant or derelict. In July 1981 the infamous Toxteth Riots took place, during which, for the first time in the UK outside Northern Ireland, tear gas was used by police against civilians. In the same year, the Tate and Lyle sugar works, previously a mainstay of the city's manufacturing economy, closed down. The docks had already declined dramatically by this stage, depriving the city of another major source of employment. By 1985, unemployment in Liverpool exceeded 20%, around double the national average. About this time the scourge of heroin, always present in port cities, began to rise. Liverpool City Council was dominated by the far- left wing Militant group during the 1980s, under the de facto leadership of Derek Hatton (although Hatton was formally only Deputy Leader). The city council sank heavily into debt, as the City Council fought a campaign to prevent central government from reducing funding for local services. Ultimately this led to 49 of the City's Councillors being removed from office by the District Auditor for refusing to cut the budget, refusing to make good the deficit and forcing the City Council into virtual bankruptcy. The conduct of Hatton and the militant tendency had even come under the scrutiny of Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock, who was keen to remove the militant tendency from the party as part of the attempt to make it electable again. At the same time, the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher was deeply unpopular in Liverpool, with the Conservatives share of the vote in most local council and parliamentary elections being consistently low throughout the 1980s. On 15 April 1989, 96 Liverpool F.C. fans (mostly from Merseyside as well as neighbouring parts of Cheshire and Lancashire) were fatally injured in the Hillsborough disaster at an FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield. This had a traumatic effect on people across the country, particularly in and around the city of Liverpool, and resulted in legally imposed changes in the way in which football fans have since been accommodated, including compulsory all-seater stadiums at all leading English clubs by the mid 1990s. Many clubs removed their perimeter fencing almost immediately after the tragedy, and such measures at football grounds in England have long since been banned. In particular this led to strong feeling in Liverpool because it was widely reported in the media that the Liverpool fans were at fault. The Sun sparked particular controversy for publishing these allegations in an article four days after the disaster. Sales of the newspaper in Liverpool slumped and many newsagents refused to stock it. Three decades later, many people in the city still refuse to buy The Sun and a number of newsagents still refuse to sell it. Other media outlets including the Daily Star and Daily Mail also printed similar stories in which the behaviour of Liverpool fans was alleged to have been a major factor in the tragedy. There was further controversy surrounding the tragedy in March 1991 when a verdict of accidental death was recorded on the 95 people who had died at Hillsborough (the 96th victim did not die until 1993), much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing, or an open verdict, to be recorded; and for criminal charges to be brought against South Yorkshire Police. This verdict was eventually replaced by one of unlawful killing at fresh inquest 25 years later. It has since become clear that South Yorkshire Police made a range of mistakes at the game, though the senior officer in charge of the event retired soon after. The success of Liverpool FC was some compensation for the city's economic misfortune during the 1970s and 1980s. The club, formed in 1892, had won five league titles by 1947, but enjoyed its first consistent run of success under the management of Bill Shankly between 1959 and 1974, winning a further three league titles as well as the club's first two FA Cups and its first European trophy in the shape of the UEFA Cup. Following Shankly's retirement, the club continued to dominate English football for nearly 20 years afterwards. By 1990, Liverpool FC had won more major trophies than any other English club - a total of 18 top division league titles, four FA Cups, four Football League Cups, four European Cups and two UEFA Cups. The club's iconic red shirt had been worn by some of the biggest names in British sport of the 1970s and 1980s, including Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish (who also served as manager from 1985 to 1991 and again from 2011 to 2012), Phil Neal, Ian Rush, Ian Callaghan and John Barnes. The club has yet to win another league title since, although it has since won a further three FA Cups, three League Cups, a UEFA Cup and two European Cups, and fielded a new wave of stars including Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen, Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard. Everton F.C., the city's original senior football club, also enjoyed a degree of success during the 1970s and 1980s. The club had enjoyed a consistent run of success during the interwar years and again in the 1960s, but after winning the league title in 1970 went 14 years without winning a major trophy, although they did hold onto the First Division place which had been theirs since 1954. Then, in 1984, Everton won the FA Cup under the management of Howard Kendall, who had once been a player at the club. A league title win followed in 1985, along with the club's first European trophy - the European Cup Winners' Cup. By 1986, the city's two clubs were firmly established as the leading club sides in England as Liverpool finished league champions and Everton runners-up, and the two sides also met for the FA Cup final, which Liverpool won 3‚Äì1. The Everton side of the mid 1980s included some of the highest rated footballers in the English league at the time; goalkeeper Neville Southall, winger Trevor Steven, forwards Graeme Sharp and Andy Gray, and Gray's successor Gary Lineker. Everton have enjoyed an unbroken run in the top flight of English football since 1954, although their only major trophy since the league title in 1987 came in 1995 when they won the FA Cup. Everton added another league title in 1987, with Liverpool finishing runners-up. Another all-Merseyside FA Cup final 1989 saw Liverpool beat Everton 3‚Äì2. This match was played just five weeks after the Hillsborough disaster. =1990s= A similar national outpouring of grief and shock to the Hillsborough disaster occurred in February 1993 when James Bulger was killed by two ten-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. The two boys were found guilty of murder later in the year and sentenced to indefinite detention. The 1990s saw the continued regeneration of the city which had started in the 1980s. This still happens in 2020 Recent history A general economic and civic revival has been underway since the mid-nineties. Liverpool's economy has grown faster than the national average and its crime levels have remained lower than most other metropolitan areas in England and Wales, with recorded crime per head in Merseyside comparable to the national average ‚Äî unusually low for an urban area. In recent years, the city has emphasised its cultural attractions. Tourism has become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy, capitalising on the popularity of The Beatles and other groups of the Merseybeat era. In June 2003, Liverpool won the right to be named European Capital of Culture for 2008, beating other British cities such as Newcastle and Birmingham to the coveted title. The riverfront of the city was also designated as a World Heritage Site in 2004. In October 2005, Liverpool City Council passed a public apology for the flooding Capel Celyn in Wales. The full statement reads - In October 2007, Liverpool and London continued with wildcat strikes after the end of the official CWU strikes that had been ongoing since June in a dispute with the Royal Mail over pay, pensions, and hours.

Life Stevan Dedijer was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina to Milica Dedijer and Jefto Dedijer. He attended secondary school in Rome, Italy, and graduated from the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, in 1930. He earned a degree in physics at Princeton University in 1934. He worked as a journalist in Pittsburgh and New York City and later, after World War II in Yugoslavia. Dedijer served in the American army as a paratrooper in The 101st Airborne Division from 1942 to 1945. He deployed into Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge from December 1944 through January 1945. General Eisenhower and his battle staff had only the 101st Airborne and the 82nd Airborne in the immediate area to hold back the German offensive. Both divisions endured great hardship, and nearly 24,000 US military died, since no supplies were able to reach the \\"Battered Bastards of Bastogne\\" until the weather improved at the end of January 1945. Dedijer's brother Vladimir Dedijer fought for Tito's Partisans, and was Tito's biographer after the war. In 1949 Stevan Dedijer returned to Belgrade as a researcher at the Belgrade Nuclear Institute. From 1952 to 1955 he was director of the Institute, though from 1954 he was gradually removed from Yugoslav political positions and he found his work conditions deteriorating throughout the later 1950s. Given leave to leave Yugoslavia in 1961, Dedijer spent a year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark before moving to Sweden. He was awarded a Honorary PhD from the University of Lund in Sweden, and after a short time at Lund University's Physics Department founded the Research Policy Institute at the University. Dedijer's research focus was on Business Intelligence and he has been named the grandfather of business intelligence by his friend, the late CIA Director William Colby. Dedijer was the first person in Europe to teach business/competitive intelligence at a university.Hans Hedin (1993) 'Business Intelligence in Sweden', Competitive Intelligence Review, Volume 4, Issue 2-3, pages 71‚Äì72, Summer-Autumn (Fall) 1993. He was a co-founder of the Swedish Intelligence Network BISNES (Business Intelligence & Strategy Network Scandinavia) together with his Ph.D student Hans Hedin and the Swedish Intelligence firm Docere Intelligence AB. Stevan Dedijer was awarded the SCIP Meritorious Award for his services in this field. During the air war in Kosovo, Dedijer lived in Dubrovnik and befriended Lieutenant Colonel Randolph Hampton, US Army who had spent nearly 45 months in the Balkans. LTC Hampton was in Dubrovnik as part of an advance party which would deploy into Kosovo for post war operations. During those months, Dedijer would meet LTC Hampton and review not only his years with the 101st ABN Division, but the historical, political and social ramifications of the war in the Balkans. LTC Hampton and Cathrine Andersen, a Norwegian OSCE human rights representative, hosted Dedijer's 88th birthday at the Marco Polo Restaurant in Old Town Dubrovnik.

It was originally built in 1873 for the International Bridge Company by Casimir Stanislaus Gzowski and D.L. MacPherson. The bridge consists of two sections, the first extending from the Canadian shore to Unity Island (formerly known as Squaw Island), and the second extending from Unity Island to the American mainland shore. The portion between these was originally built on a trestle, but was filled to form an embankment soon after the bridge opened. Once on the American mainland, rail traffic is received by the Black Rock Rail Yard. The CN Rail Fort Erie Yard for interchange (shops and roundhouse) is now closed.  The need for a bridge  Before bridges crossed the Upper Niagara River, it was crossed by several ferries running between Fort Erie and Buffalo. As well as being a serious bottleneck to both freight and passenger traffic, this crossing was often dangerous as the current in this area is swift, and ice is a problem several months of the year. Proposals for a bridge surface by 1856, raising concerns about the effect to navigation rights on the river. By 1857, the Grand Trunk Railway had also proposed the crossing. The Dominion of Canada and the New York State Legislature drafted an agreement for construction of the bridge. Engineering surveys and fundraising took place over the next several years. Construction of the bridge was recognized as a major technological challenge. The Niagara River in this area is up to deep and flows at up to . It is also located at the east end of Lake Erie, and during the spring, large blocks of ice often flow down the river, threatening to destroy any bridge placed in its path. There are also major financial challenges in a project such as this. Accordingly, some years were required to overcome these obstacles. Additionally, in the 1860s, the American Civil War, and rebuilding afterwards, consumed much of the resources of the United States and further delayed construction. It is noted though that planning did not stop altogether, even during the war. A meeting of the Commissioners of the company took place on April 5, 1864. On May 18, 1870, The American and Dominion International Bridge Companies met to merge into one corporation for the purpose of building this bridge. A contract for the construction of the bridge was concluded with C. S. Gzowski & Co. It was stated that the bridge should be completed by the end of 1871.  Construction  Prior to the construction of the eight stone piers, it was necessary to remove up to ten feet (three meters) of gravel from the bottom of the river. The piers were constructed from stone quarried at various locations on the Canadian side. Each pier was both pointed and sloped on the upstream side to most effectively break up ice flows. The iron for the bridge was manufactured at Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. Each of the 12 Pratt Truss spans was constructed on floating pontoons between the piers. Upon completion, the pontoons were filled with water to lower the bridge span precisely into place on the piers. The bridge was constructed with two swing spans. One was located on the American side of the main channel of the river and provided a navigable opening of width. The second was located over the Black Rock Harbor and provided a navigable opening of width. Both were operated by steam and could open or close in approximately fifty seconds. The portion of the bridge from Unity Island to the US Mainland was constructed for two tracks. The longer portion from Unity Island to Canada was built as only a single track. Both sections had a common sidewalk on one side. The bridge was opened November 3, 1873, almost two years after the date originally envisioned. Construction cost $1.5 million. It was constructed without the loss of any lives, which was uncommon for a major construction project in that era.  Bridge operations and changes  Photo from ca. 1900-1915, from Canadian side looking towards Buffalo Before the opening day of the bridge, many railroads had already constructed tracks to its location. The Grand Trunk, Great Western, Canada Southern Railway, Erie, New York Central and New York, West Shore and Chicago were all prepared to begin using the bridge soon after opening day. There were conflicts between the various companies using the bridge, including one where the Canada Southern Railway filed suit over the excessive rate of $1 charged for each rail car it carried over the bridge. Such conflicts are not unexpected when several competing railway companies use a single track. The bridge was modified in 1900, during which time the pedestrian walkway was removed from the main span. In 1903 baseball superstar \\"Big\\" Ed Delahanty, age 35, died in an attempted crossing after being removed from a passenger train for being too drunk and abusive to passengers, threatening some with a razor after \\"5 whiskies\\". The bridge's busiest day ever was July 10, 1916, when 264 trains crossed. The swing bridge in the main channel, which does not cross the international border, ceased to open at some time between 1941 and 1944 (it appears on the US War Department chart 312 in February 1941, but not on the same chart in March 1944, or any time thereafter). The swing span between Unity Island and the American mainland continues to swing today. This portion of the bridge was built for two tracks, but currently carries only one. It also carries a road on one side, and a bicycle lane on the other side. This span also crosses over Interstate 190, the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway. Operations on the bridge were suddenly suspended in February 1993 due to problems with some of the stone piers. Canadian National spent $2 million to refurbish these and get the bridge back into operation.  The bridge today  From the United States side (2014) The bridge is now part of the Canadian National Railway Stamford Subdivision. It is also used by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The bridge has seen an increase in traffic since the Canadian Pacific abandoned its route via Niagara Falls, Ontario and re-routed across this bridge in late 2001. Fifteen trains per day is now typical and often trains are seen at or near a stop on the bridge undergoing various security checks to cross the international border. The bridge no longer carries any passenger trains.

As of January 1, 2014, Goldenwest and USU Credit Union serve more than 106,000 members, hold over $1 billion in assets, and operate 26 branches in Utah from Smithfield to St George.  History  USU Credit Union was founded in the halls of Utah State University (USU) in Logan, UT in 1957 by economic professors Vernon Israelson and Evan Murray. Originally chartered with ten members, the Credit Union was created to provide banking services for USU employees and their families. In the early years, deposits and transactions literally moved from room to room and from drawer to drawer as the professors, who doubled as loan officers and accountants, worked to keep overhead costs low. In 1962 the Credit Union hired its first full-time employee Doris Thorpe. As Director of Marketing, Thorpe enlisted the talents of her illustrator husband to create memorable and effective advertising that sparked tremendous growth in those early years. In a 10-year span membership rose from 40% of USU employees to over 83%. Assets grew from around $50,000 in 1957 to over $1.22 million by 1968. Ground broke in 1975 to begin construction on the Credit Union‚Äôs first branch just off USU‚Äôs campus. The building was completed in 1978. The following is an excerpt from USU‚Äôs student newspaper, dated April 18, 1978: :Dedication of the new building located at 695 East 10th North, will be Thursday. University President Glen L. Taggart will give the dedicatory address at 4 p.m. Reo L. Williamson, manager-treasurer for the Credit Union explained the new 10,498 square foot building has become a necessity for the rapidly growing union. In 1957 the Credit Union was incorporated with 10 members. Today there are 4,138 members. :‚ÄúWith our rapid growth over the past couple of years we have outgrown the old facility which was owned by the university,‚Äù said Williamson... In 1984, the Credit Union opened its first off-campus branch in the old Macey‚Äôs store at the south end of Logan. When Macey‚Äôs closed that location in 1992, the Credit Union purchased a new building at 198 North Main. Other new branches followed in Smithfield (2003), Providence (2006) and Brigham City (2007) in northern Utah. On October 1, 2013, USU Credit Union merged with Goldenwest Credit Union. USU Credit Union retains its name and USU-affiliated brand as a Division of Goldenwest Credit Union.

The show was produced in 1972 and 1973 by the National Instructional Television Center (NIT), in association with various contributing stations, such as KETC in St. Louis, Missouri, WVIZ in Cleveland Ohio, WNVT-TV in Northern Virginia, and The Ontario Educational Communications Authority. It was one of the last programs to be produced by NIT; the organisation would be reformulated as the Agency for Instructional Television (AIT) in April 1973. Funding for Inside/Out was provided by grants from 32 different educational agencies within the United States and Canada, with additional support from Exxon Corporation. The series' uncredited theme music is an excerpt from \\"Ripple\\" by composer Simon Haseley and performed by \\"The London Studio Group\\", sourced from the De Wolfe production music library. Overview of series Inside/Out was an anthology series of 15-minute shorts that were designed to teach children about social issues. Instead of resorting to happy endings, as many shows of this kind had done, Inside/Out typically had cliffhanger endings, leaving the viewers to draw their own conclusions as to what they would do in similar situations. Due to the critical acclaim for this series, some PBS stations would double-run two Inside/Out episodes in a half-hour time slot in the evening so that parents could watch this series with their children. This series was commonly watched on classroom TV broadcasts during school hours as well as on 16mm film reels. It was a staple of daytime instructional television blocks (generally programmed by local agencies or school boards rather than by PBS) on public TV stations for many years, until at least the late 1980s. Inside/Out was the first in a series of similarly produced instructional programs made by AIT. Others that followed that used the similar formula included Bread and Butterflies (1974), Self Incorporated (1975), Trade-Offs (a program on economic theory, 1978), Thinkabout (a series on creativity, 1979), On The Level (1980) and Give & Take (a series about the economy in general, 1982). All of the series, including Inside/Out, were produced for only one season, but were frequently rerun on television and shown in schools for several years afterward, as the topics presented kept its currency. In 1974, Bantam Books' young readers' Pathfinder series, in their Canadian branch, published Stories from Inside/Out by children's writer and screenwriter Ken Sobol, which adapted several of the series scripts to prose, and included discussion questions. In 1996, AIT produced an updated version of the series, Looking from the Inside/Out.

It is identical in concept to failure rate, also called hazard function, in reliability theory. Motivation and definition In a life table, we consider the probability of a person dying from age x to x + 1, called qx. In the continuous case, we could also consider the conditional probability of a person who has attained age (x) dying between ages x and x + Œîx, which is :P_{x}(Delta x)=P(xx)=frac{F_X(x+Delta;x)-F_X(x)}{(1-F_X(x))} where FX(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the continuous age-at-death random variable, X. As Œîx tends to zero, so does this probability in the continuous case. The approximate force of mortality is this probability divided by Œîx. If we let Œîx tend to zero, we get the function for force of mortality, denoted by mu(x): :mu,(x)= lim_{Delta x rightarrow 0} frac{F_X(x+Delta;x)-F_X(x)}{Delta x (1-F_X(x))} = frac{F'_X(x)}{1-F_X(x)} Since fX(x)=F 'X(x) is the probability density function of X, and S(x) = 1 - FX(x) is the survival function, the force of mortality can also be expressed variously as: :mu,(x)=frac{f_X(x)}{1-F_X(x)}=-frac{S'(x)}{S(x)}=-{frac{d}{dx}}ln[S(x)]. To understand conceptually how the force of mortality operates within a population, consider that the ages, x, where the probability density function fX(x) is zero, there is no chance of dying. Thus the force of mortality at these ages is zero. The force of mortality Œº(x) uniquely defines a probability density function fX(x). The force of mortality mu(x) can be interpreted as the conditional density of failure at age x, while f(x) is the unconditional density of failure at age x.R. Cunningham, T. Herzog, R. London (2008). Models for Quantifying Risk, 3rd Edition, Actex. The unconditional density of failure at age x is the product of the probability of survival to age x, and the conditional density of failure at age x, given survival to age x. This is expressed in symbols as :,mu(x)S(x) = f_X(x) or equivalently :mu(x) = frac{f_X(x)}{S(x)}. In many instances, it is also desirable to determine the survival probability function when the force of mortality is known. To do this, integrate the force of mortality over the interval x to x + t : int_{x}^{x+t} mu(y) , dy = int_{x}^{x+t} -frac{d}{dy} ln[S(y)], dy . By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this is simply : -int_{x}^{x+t} mu(y) , dy = ln[S(x + t)] - ln[S(x)]. Let us denote : S_x(t) = frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)}, then taking the exponent to the base e, the survival probability of an individual of age x in terms of the force of mortality is : S_x(t) = exp left(-int_x^{x+t}mu(y), dy, right). Examples * The simplest example is when the force of mortality is constant: :mu(y) = lambda, :then the survival function is :S_x(t) = e^{-int_x^{x+t} lambda dy} = e^{-lambda t}, :is the exponential distribution. * When the force of mortality is :mu(y) = frac{y^{alpha-1} e^{-y}}{Gamma(alpha) - gamma(alpha, y)}, :where Œ≥(Œ±,y) is the lower incomplete gamma function, the probability density function that of Gamma distribution :f(x) = frac{x^{alpha - 1} e^{-x}}{Gamma(alpha)}. * When the force of mortality is : mu(y) = alpha lambda^alpha y^{alpha-1}, :where Œ± ‚â• 0, we have :int_x^{x+t}mu(y) dy = alpha lambda^alpha int_x^{x+t} y^{alpha-1} dy = lambda^alpha( (x+t)^alpha - x^alpha). :Thus, the survival function is :S_x(t) = e^{-int_x^{x+t}mu(y) dy} = A(x) e^{ - (lambda (x+t))^alpha }, :where A(x) = e^{(lambda x)^{alpha}}. This is the survival function for Weibull distribution. For Œ± = 1, it is same as the exponential distribution. * Another famous example is when the survival model follows Gompertz‚ÄìMakeham law of mortality.Dickson, David C.M., Cambridge (2009). Actuarial Mathematics for Life Contingent Risks, First Edition, Cambridge University Press. In this case, the force of mortality is :mu(y) = A + Bc^{y} quadtext{for } y geqslant 0. :Using the last formula, we have :int_x^{x+t} (A + Bc^{y}) dy = At + B(c^{x+t}-c^{x})/ln[c]. :Then :S_x(t) = e^{-(At + B(c^{x+t}-c^{x})/ln[c])} = e^{-At} g^{c^{x} (c^{t}-1)} :where g=e^{-B/ln[c]}.

For many years a Labour Member of Parliament, he also served as British High Commissioner in Accra and Nairobi, and later as President of the Council of Europe. Family and early career Geoffrey de Freitas was the son of Sir Anthony and Lady (Edith) de Freitas.Anthony Patrick de Freitas, born in Grenada in 1869, died 1940 Edith de Freitas, born Edith Maud Short in Chantilly, Grenada, married 1899 Sir Anthony was Chief Justice of St. Vincent in Geoffrey's youth, and later of British Guiana, having held a variety of legal and administrative posts in the British West Indies. De Freitas was educated at Haileybury and Clare College, Cambridge, where he was an athlete, and president of the Cambridge Union Society. Two years at Yale followed, with a Mellon Fellowship in international law, and in 1936 on the voyage home he met his future wife, Helen Graham Bell, a Bryn Mawr graduate and daughter of Laird Bell, a Chicago lawyer and Democrat. In 1938, they married, and lived in London where de Freitas was pursuing a career as a barrister, gaining political experience as a Labour councillor in Shoreditch, and co-leading a boys' club in Hoxton. During the Second World War he became a Squadron Leader in the Royal Air Force, but returned to politics in 1945, the family living at Loughton and then Cambridge. Parliament and abroad He beat the sitting Conservative MP for Nottingham Central in the 1945 election, and was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Clement Attlee. As Under-Secretary for Air he went to the United Nations Assembly at Lake Success in 1947. Some years later he would co- author a booklet on the subject of an Atlantic Assembly,De Freitas and McLachlan, NATO is not enough : two approaches to an Atlantic Assembly (1956) and he had a long-standing connection with the North Atlantic Assembly. In the 1950 general election de Freitas became Member of Parliament for Lincoln. He was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department and held a succession of front bench posts throughout the decade. For a while Betty Boothroyd was assistant to de Freitas and she remained a friend of the family. Geoffrey and Helen now had three sons and a daughter. In 1961 de Freitas was nominated to be British High Commissioner to Ghana, and was knighted in October of that year. He resigned his seat in the Commons on 20 December 1961, taking the sinecure of Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. He was the first Labour appointment to an important role in one of the newly independent former British colonies. In 1957 he had chaired a Hansard Society conference on parliamentary government in West Africa.What are the problems of parliamentary government in West Africa?: the report of a conference held by the Hansard Society for Parliamentary Government at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, September 1957 under the chairmanship of Geoffrey de Freitas M.P (Hansard Society 1958) After Accra, he was briefly in Nairobi, as British representative supporting an attempt to build a Federation of East Africa which would include Uganda, Tanganyika and Kenya. In 1964 he was invited to stand for election to represent Kettering, then a safe Labour seat, and returned to England. There was no front bench role for him with Harold Wilson as party leader, but de Freitas led the Labour delegation to the Council of Europe in 1965 and was President of the Council from 1966‚Äì1969. In 1971 his reluctance to be nominated for election as Speaker of the House of Commons led to a reappraisal of the system. From 1975‚Äì1979 de Freitas was a delegate to the European Parliament. He retired from politics in 1979 and died three years later, in Cambridge, aged 69. The autobiography he was writing with his wife, The slighter side of a long public life, was published in 1985.

It has been an important research organism for studying eukaryotic cell biology for over 50 years, being used to study a wide range of subjects including recombination, DNA repair, mutation, cell cycle control, tubulin, chromatin, nucleokinesis, pathogenesis, metabolism, and experimental evolution. It is one of the few species in its genus able to form sexual spores through meiosis, allowing crossing of strains in the laboratory. A. nidulans is a homothallic fungus, meaning it is able to self-fertilize and form fruiting bodies in the absence of a mating partner. It has septate hyphae with a woolly colony texture and white mycelia. The green colour of wild-type colonies is due to pigmentation of the spores, while mutations in the pigmentation pathway can produce other spore colours. Genome The A. nidulans genome was sequenced in a collaboration between Monsanto and the Broad Institute. A sequence with 13-fold coverage was publicly released in March 2003; analysis of the annotated genome was published in Nature in December 2005. It is 30 million base pairs in size and is predicted to contain around 9,500 protein-coding genes on eight chromosomes. Recently, several caspase-like proteases were isolated from A. nidulans samples under which programmed cell death had been induced. Findings such as these play a key role in determining the evolutionary conservation of the mitochondrion within the eukaryotic cell, and its role as an ancient proteobacterium capable of inducing cell death. Sexual reproduction Sexual reproduction occurs in two fundamentally different ways. This is by outcrossing (heterothallic sex), in which two distinct individuals contribute nuclei, or by homothallic sex or self-fertilization (selfing) in which both nuclei are derived from the same individual. Selfing in A. nidulans involves activation of the same mating pathways characteristic of sex in outcrossing species, i.e. self-fertilization does not bypass required pathways for outcrossing sex but instead requires activation of these pathways within a single individual. Fusion of haploid nuclei occurs within reproductive structures termed cleistothecia, in which the diploid zygote undergoes meiotic divisions to yield haploid ascospores. Use in pharmaceutical research Anidulafungin is a semisynthetic lipopeptide antifungal drug of echinocandin B subclass, derived from a fermentation product of A. nidulans var. echinulatus strain A 32204, was discovered in Germany in 1974; echinocandins destabilize the fungal cell wall by inhibiting the synthesis of an integral component called glucan, via the noncompetitive inhibition of the enzyme 1,3-Œ≤ glucan synthase.

It connects Lelystad, capital of the province of Flevoland, with Zwolle, capital of the neighbouring province of Overijssel, and provides a direct rail link between Flevoland and the north-east of the Netherlands. Construction The Hanzelijn project was essentially a less- costly alternative to the Zuiderzeelijn (Zuiderzee Line), a projected new Lelystad-Groningen line via Emmeloord, Heerenveen and Drachten for which planning was cancelled in 2007. Work started in January 2007 and was completed in December 2012. Two new stations have been built: Dronten and Kampen Zuid. The maximum speed on most of the line is , though no Dutch domestic rolling stock can achieve speeds greater than , until 2021. Also trains using the railway do not run faster than since only ATB-EG is being used by the trains currently using the railway. The railway was opened by Queen Beatrix as the Dutch Royal Train traversed the line on 6 December 2012, and scheduled services began operating on Sunday, 9 December 2012. The journey from Lelystad to Zwolle will take 30 minutes, reducing the time taken from Amsterdam to Zwolle ‚Äì and further north ‚Äì by about 15 minutes. The total length of the new track is 50 km. Infrastructure The line includes a 790 m (2,592 ft) tunnel under the Drontermeer (the semi-artificial channel separating the mainland from the reclaimed Eastern Flevoland), and joins the existing Utrecht‚ÄìZwolle‚ÄìKampen rail line just before the 1 km (0.6 mile) high-level fixed bridge over the river IJssel. This new bridge, which includes a separate pedestrian and cycle track, opened on 14 June 2011, replacing a rail-only twin-span vertical-lift drawbridge. Tunnel under the Drontermeer Journey times The Hanzelijn has shortened journey times between Zwolle and Amsterdam by at least 10 minutes, and up to 20 minutes for some journeys.

It reached #5 on the UK Charts becoming the band's second highest album after 1992 - The Love Album which reached #1. The album featured two singles \\"Lean On Me I Won't Fall Over\\", which reached number 16 on the UK charts, and \\"Lenny And Terence,\\" which reached number 40. The band recorded the album with co-producer and engineer Simon Painter and worked in a much more spontaneous approach than before, to an extent that even saw the band crafting songs from accidental pieces. The album shows the band working in new styles in attempt to \\"prove themselves\\" after the critical disdain that the band had started to pick up in late 1992. There are numerous other musical styles explored on the album besides the band's usual drum machine-based punk rock, and some of Jim Bob's lyrics had started to become more personal, sitting alongside tracks which are more traditionally politically or socially based. The album was a critical success, with critics complimenting the new approaches that the band had undertaken. In their lists of the top 50 albums of the year, NME named it 22nd whilst Select named it 46th. The band played the entire album live for the first time in Kentish Town in November 2009. Background and recording Cater the Unstoppable Sex Machine reached their commercial peak with 1992 ‚Äì The Love Album, which debuted at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart in May 1992. The album was released to critical acclaim, and was named the 32nd best album of 1992 by NME at the end of the year.1992 - NME Nonetheless, the band \\"fell from grace\\" after the album's release, and the album's third single \\"The Impossible Dream\\" was a critically panned flop. The duo soon felt they were only able to garner \\"the occasional piss-take in the gossip pages.\\" Deadline magazine recalled that it seemed the band \\"were well and truly finished\\" and that it appeared people were tired of the band. For the follow-up album, which the duo named Post Historic Monsters, the band felt a change in approach was necessary. Although singer Jim Bob felt the negative comments at the time of the release of \\"The Impossible Dream\\" were \\"completely pointless,\\" he nonetheless conceded that the duo's output up until that point was \\"really easy to parody.\\" He felt that \\"parts of 1992 could have been made by Bobby Davro. It was up for that kind of a bashing.\\" The duo felt it was not only critics but also fans who had grown tired of the duo, and their label who Bob felt lacked the \\"over-the-top enthusiasm\\" they bore when the duo signed with them. The duo had also grown tired of writing and playing music, and held off releasing any material for almost a year. Bob said: \\"We knew we had to come up with a good album or that would have been the end of it.\\" Fruitbat of the duo said that, with Post Historic Monsters, \\"we knew we had something to prove. We didn't want anybody to be allowed to dismiss us. No fucking way!\\" The band recorded Post Historic Monsters in 1993, co-producing the album between themselves and Simon Painter.Liner notes. Painter also engineered the album, whilst Kevin Metcalf mastered it. The duo took a much more spontaneous approach when creating the album than they had with previous albums. As such, several of the songs, which began as mistakes or lesser-projects, became fully developed songs. \\"The Music That Nobody Likes\\" had begun as a mistake, whilst \\"Evil\\" is \\"an experimental B-side gone haywire;\\" Bob said that as a result of creations such as these and the more spontaneous approach that birthed them, the album became \\"just so much more refreshing.\\" Style and composition Keen to \\"prove themselves\\" with Post Historic Monsters, the album is a musical and lyrical departure from previous records by the band. According to Deadline magazine, it shows the band \\"moving into previously uncharted musical and lyrical territories,\\" and made note of the excess of surprises on the album. The album is darker and \\"more fed-up\\" than the band's previous albums, with a directness and bitterness that contrasts with the \\"more overtly tongue in cheek\\" style of previous albums such as 101 Damnations or 1992: The Love Album. In an interview with Deadline magazine, Jim Bob said \\"the difference between Post Historic Monsters and the records we have put out since 101 Damnations is that you can listen to it without prejudice. There's none of that stuff that usually puts people off. It's like it doesn't matter that it's a Carter record. It could almost be by anyone.\\" =Music= Like the band's previous work, Post Historic Monsters is a dance-rock and electronic rock album characterised by its punk rock-styled distorted guitars and chattering sequencers and electronic beats, but there are numerous exceptions to this style throughout the record, including \\"Being There\\", which features a lounge music-styled jazz style and a piano solo, the acoustic folk of \\"Suicide Isn't Painless\\" and the ironic \\"mainstream schmaltz\\" of \\"Under the Thumb and Over the Moon.\\" \\"Stuff the Jubilee!\\" has been compared to the soundtrack of the 1969 musical film Oh! What a Lovely War, whilst \\"Evil\\" features backwards elements and a country and western snippet. \\"Lenny and Terence\\" has been described as resembling \\"Ministry covering Black Sabbath,\\" and Bob's vocals on the song are laden with audio effects. \\"The Music That Nobody Likes\\" and \\"Mid- Day Crisis\\", the couplet of tracks that follow the record's intro track \\"2 Million Years B.C.\\", were described by Hot Press as a \\"double whammy opening attack\\" which immediately introduce the duo's new direction. The magazine felt that both songs were driven by metal guitar that was as indebted to the rock scene in Seattle as it was to the duo's native South London. Although \\"Lean On Me I Won't Fall Over\\" is closer to the duo's typical musical style, it nonetheless features a live drummer and a skipping piano loop. Simon Rueben of The Line of Best Fit described the song as \\"a rolling melody, heaving song of piano and pregnant pauses.\\" =Lyrics= Jim Bob (pictured left) wrote more personal lyrics for Post Historic Monsters. Although the duo's characteristic usage of puns and \\"twisted cliches\\" feature in the album's lyrics, the record nonetheless offers \\"some straightforward, succinct observations,\\" with several songs being more introspective than before and tackling personal subjects. One review described the lyrics as showing the duo \\"railing in highly amusing dudgeon at fascists, political strife, war, ethnic cleansing, moral collapse, royal celebrations, racists, unnamed people you would have to be English to recognize, pop stars, pop songs and a whole lot more.\\" There are only three references to London on the album, much less than on previous albums. \\"A Bachelor for Baden Powell\\", about a young boy's attempt to avoid the \\"roving hands of his scoutmaster\\", is among the personal songs, based on an incident that happened to Bob as a child. Bob wrote the song as \\"almost a joke\\", explaining \\"the whole thing seemed pretty funny to me. Maybe it was some kind of relief. Until I wrote that song, I hadn't told anyone. And the way I chose to tell someone was by telling absolutely everyone. I had to broadcast it.\\" \\"Suicide Isn't Painless\\" refers to Richey Edwards of Manic Street Preachers and denounces how he would exploit his own mental health problems in the music press, whilst \\"Lenny and Terence\\" criticises the fetishisation of retro musical styles in the music of rock musician Lenny Kravitz and soul singer Terence Trent D'Arby. \\"The Music That Nobody Likes\\", which asks \\"the imponderable\\", is about the rise of the extreme right and features lyrics such as \\"If love is the answer / What was the question / And can it cure my indigestion?\\". \\"Mid Day Crisis\\" is about \\"David Koresh's wayward Wacko adventures.\\" \\"Travis\\" pays 'psychotic' homage to Robert De Niro's anti-hero character Travis Bickle from the film Taxi Driver', whilst \\"Under The Thumb And Over The Moon\\" is an unashamedly saccharine love song dedicated by Bob to his wife. The controversial \\"Commercial Fucking Suicide Part 1\\" was omitted from UK editions but added to American editions as a bonus track. Trouser Press, describing the song's lyrics, wrote: \\"[A]fter calling Michael Jackson a liar and noting that Bono is not 'the new messiah,' Jim Bob blurts out, \\"'f you buy this record today / It's not true what the advertisements say / Your life won't be greatly improved / But Christ you've got nothing to lose / And we've got so much to gain.' Honesty ‚Äî what a sick concept. Perhaps significantly, the song was added to the US edition and omitted from the UK.\\" Release and promotion The album was preceded by the single \\"Lean On Me I Won't Fall Over\\". Unlike many CD singles at the time, the CD release of the former single was only issued with one track listing, as opposed to two-part \\"CD1\\" and \\"CD2\\" singles sold separately, and featured a message in its liner notes reading \\"Part One in a one part pack.\\" It reached number 16 in the UK Singles Chart, with its sales almost entirely being within the first week, and the band performed it on The Box. Post Historic Monsters was released on 6 September 1993 by Chrysalis Records. In the United States, the album was released by both Chrysalis and I.R.S. Records. Upon release, the album entered and peaked at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart, a decline on the number 1 peak achieved by 1992 and the beginning of the band's declining fortunes, although it is their second highest-charting album. Ned Raggett of Allmusic felt the album's lesser success than 1992: The Love Album was due to it becoming \\"lost in the post-grunge fallout.\\" Releasing \\"Lenny and Terence\\" as the album's second single was considered a gamble, and a \\"hell of a risk\\" in the words of Deadline magazine; Bob predicted that the release of the single would \\"destroy everything we've built up‚Äìeverything‚Äìin one blow. I mean, it's not even the version that appears on the album. We've re-recorded it and made it substantially less radio playable.\\"Carter USM interview with Deadline October 1993 Fruitbat said \\"it's a good test. The thing is, if all the people who bought 'Lean on Me' the week it came out do the same with Lenny and Terence, Top of the Pops will have to consider putting us on. It could ruin our careers, but it's well worth doing.\\" The single was not much of a commercial success, only managing to reach number 40 on the UK Singles Chart. The duo were interviewed in a dinosaur museum, in reference to the album title and cover, on BBC music show The O-Zone; the interview has been named one of \\"the 12 most awkward music interviews on children's television.\\" When asked by Philippa Forrester during the interview if the album title was inspired by the publicity surrounding Jurassic Park at the time, the duo said jokingly replied it was a \\"cheap cash-in\\". Bob joked that he was not put-off in changing the title because of the film except when magazine covers featured promises of \\"no dinosaurs\\", which he declared \\"a bit of an advertising problem.\\" The interview became so subdued to a point where a caption appeared on screen saying \\"Carter found it difficult to talk about their new single ‚Äì so we asked an easier question.\\" In late 1993 and early 1994, the duo promoted the album with a tour which mostly played around the UK and Europe. Real Gone, describing the duo's performance at Tonbridge Angel Centre on 21 October, said \\"the very idea that this band would venture into the middle of Kent and play a show in a leisure centre seems like a visit from music royalty.\\" Bob wore a shirt reading \\"I hate peanuts!\\", in reference to a KP advert using one of the duo's best-known singles. Critical reception and legacy Post Historic Monsters was released to favourable reviews by music critics, who praised the band's new approaches. Bob noted that \\"a lot of the journalists who have put the boot into us have had to admit that they like this album. Or at least some of it.\\" Stuart Clark of Hot Press said \\"there's a definite feeling that Carter are trying to prove that they're more than a couple of silly haircuts and a hyperactive beatbox. Don't go expecting any radical transformations - there are no string sections or girlie backing vocals here, mate! - but, in their own sweet New Cross way, Carter have managed to combine born again maturity with the reckless sense of abandon that has always been their most endearing trademark.\\" The review said that even the songs which \\"diehard fans minght regard as 'vintage Carter'\\" are still able to \\"pull themselves free of the post-punk rut that the lads started falling into on their 30 Something and 1992 albums.\\" Retrospective reviews have also been favourable. Stewart Mason of Allmusic rated the album three stars out of five, a less favourable score than those awarded by the website to the band's previous albums. Mason said that the album was \\"a solid but somewhat hectoring album\\" which \\"is a bit wearying to listen to.\\" Trouser Press were favourable to the album, praising the back-to-basics lyrical approach and the musical style, and described the songs on the album which diverge from that style as \\"a few usefully contrasting digressions.\\" Deadline said the album was band's \\"strongest LP\\" since 101 Damnations, commenting that it \\"recaptures the anger and the frustration, the all-round urgency, of their debut.\\" In the 2011 edition of Colin Larkin's book Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Larkin rated the album four stars out of five, one of three albums by the duo to receive the rating. At the end of 1993, NME ranked the album at number 22 in its list of the top 50 \\"Albums of the Year,\\" whilst Select ranked the album at number 46 in their own list of the year's 50 best albums. On 13 November 2009, the band played the album live in its entirety alongside 1992: The Love Album at the Kentish Town Forum, London, as part of their \\"The Drum Machine Years\\" tour, something they had never previously done.

In 1978, he was awarded Virginia Tech's Teaching Excellence Certificate. Outside of Virginia Tech, Roselle continued to contribute to education and the field of mathematics. He joined the Mathematical Association of America and served as the organization's secretary from 1975 until 1984. He reviewed articles for several peer-reviewed journals, including Mathematical Reviews. He became a member of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, the American Mathematical Society, and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, which presented him with its Certificate of Appreciation in 1984. In 1976, Roselle's undergraduate Alma mater granted him its Distinguished Alumnus Award and in 1994 that institution awarded him an honorary doctoral degree. In 1979, at just 40 years of age, Roselle was appointed Dean of the Graduate School for Virginia Tech. In 1981, he was named Dean of Research and Graduate Studies. In 1983, Roselle was appointed Provost of Virginia Tech. As provost, Roselle continued his commitment to and helped increase support for sponsored research. He pushed for upgrades in campus information systems and strived to ensure computing resources were available to all students. President of the University of Kentucky On July 1, 1987, David Roselle became the ninth President of the University of Kentucky. Although the position thrust Roselle into national prominence in the field of academia, his tenure was often rocky. Much of Roselle's time as President of the University of Kentucky was absorbed by a scandal that erupted in 1988 involving the men's basketball team. The NCAA alleged 17 violations of the organization's rules. The most serious allegations were that a basketball recruit, Eric Manuel, received help on the ACT college entrance exam and another recruit, Chris Mills, received $1,000 in cash from assistant coach Dwane Casey. Roselle was widely praised for his decisive response to the scandal. Roselle forced head coach Eddie Sutton to resign in favor of then-New York Knicks coach Rick Pitino, and also forced athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign in favor of C. M. Newton, launched an extensive internal investigation, implemented new policies which tightened control of the athletic department, and cooperated completely with NCAA investigators. These actions were credited with preventing the basketball team from being disbanded for two seasons, as the NCAA's Committee on Infractions initially recommended. Although Roselle handled the basketball scandal deftly, the ordeal still absorbed precious time and resources that the President had intended to spend on other goals. However, he still succeeded in creating a new position, the Vice President for Information System, to continue his push for greater access to technology on campus. After stepping down as the university's president, the University of Kentucky National Alumni Association awarded him its Distinguished Service Award. Also, on October 25, 2011, the Board of Trustees of the University of Kentucky unanimously approved renaming the temporarily named \\"New North Hall,\\" a recently constructed 144 bed residence building, as \\"David P. Roselle Hall\\". President of the University of Delaware In the wake of the basketball scandal and proposed budget cuts by the Kentucky Legislature, Roselle left the University of Kentucky to accept a post as President of the University of Delaware. He was unanimously elected the university's 25th president by the Board of Trustees. His term began May 1, 1990. He was the highest paid public university president in the nation, making $874,687 annually. Roselle's tenure as President was marked by aggressive fund-raising campaigns and an increase in fiscal discipline. Through privatizing many services and other cost-cutting measures, he cut the university's annual budget by $32 million and eliminated the school's $8 million annual deficit. Under Roselle's leadership, the university's endowment more than tripled from $362 million when he took office in 1990 to over $1.4 billion in 2006. In addition to the increase in the endowment, Roselle's fundraising allowed for the renovation of over a dozen older buildings and the construction of several new buildings on campus. The new buildings include a student center named after former University President Edward A. Trabant, the Charles C. Allen Jr. Laboratory, MBNA America Hall (now Alfred Lerner Hall), Gore Hall, and the Louise and David Roselle Center For the Arts, which was named in his wife and his honor. The renovations and new constructions were a part of a general campus beautification project that included brick walkways, ivy wall coverings, and the planting of new trees. As he had at Virginia Tech and University of Kentucky, Roselle also made student access to technology a top priority. Not long after the beginning of his tenure as president, every class room, residence hall room, and office was wired to the campus' computer network. Roselle was also active in the community of the state of Delaware. In addition to acting as President of its top university, he served on the boards of Winterthur Museum, the Wilmington Grand Opera House, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Delaware and the Wilmington Trust Company. He is also a member of the Boards of OCLC, Brown Advisory and SOKA University. In 2005, Roselle and Robert Carothers were the first recipients of the American Council on Education's Fellows Mentor Award. His intent was to resign on May 1, 2007, exactly 17 years after his term began, but Roselle served until July 1, 2007, when he was succeeded by Patrick T. Harker, formerly Dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. On June 1, 2008, Roselle began service as Interim Director of Winterthur Museum, Garden and Country Estate. In November he was named Winterthur's Director. In 2012, Delaware Today named Roselle as one of \\"The 50 Most Influential Delawareans in the Past 50 Years.\\" The accompanying citation highlighted improvements at the University of Delaware during his tenure.

The station, previously owned by Sindy Fuller, through licensee Bridge to Bridge, Inc., was acquired by Black Diamond Broadcast Group, LLC in 2015 and broadcasts a classic hits format. Black Diamond's purchase of both WUPS and sister station WTWS was consummated on February 4, 2015 at a price of $1.65 million. The station signed on in 1961 to complement its sister station, WHGR/1290 (the callsign stood for Houghton Lake/Grayling/Roscommon). In the beginning, the station, known as WJGS (for owners Jacob and Garnett Sparks), was 19,000 watts. In the 1960s, a fire destroyed the WJGS/WHGR studios right before Christmas. They ended up broadcasting from a trailer until a new building was built. Throughout most of the 1960s and through the 1980s, WJGS was automated MOR. During the '80s, WJGS was also an affiliate of Casey Kasem's American Top 40 countdown show. In 1983, Sparks Broadcasting sold the stations to Shea Broadcasting, who sold it to Melling Tool and Die in 1988. WJGS's power was increased to 100,000 watts, flipped to CHR and became WUPS. The station was named after the United Parcel Service, for their longtime slogan is \\"We Deliver the Hits\\". With its central location in Houghton Lake, WUPS's signal is heard in most of northern and central Michigan, with a coverage area stretching from Indian River southward to Ithaca. WUPS's 100,000-watt signal can reach further south as well. It is common for reception in the mid-Michigan thumb and Saginaw Bay as well, a good 100 miles from its transmitter. For a short time in the early 1990s, the station was simulcasted to the Traverse City, Michigan area on WMLB 98.1 (now WGFN; ironically now a sister station to WUPS). Throughout most of the 1990s, WUPS's format changed several times: adult top 40, hot AC, all-1970s, all-1970s-1980s, classic hits/hot AC hybrid and its current format, 1960s-1980s classic hits. In 1998, John Salov bought out Melling and created a huge controversy in 2001 when he sold WHGR - then satellite-fed standards - to Clear Channel Communications for $250,000, making it their first property in northern Michigan. However, they bought out WHGR for only one reason: to shut it down. They wanted to expand their Grand Rapids station, WOOD/1300 to 25,000 watts, and the only way to do so was to shut down WHGR. The move stunned many people in the Houghton Lake area who had grown up with the station. Today, WUPS broadcasts from studios on M-18/M-55 in Prudenville, as their old studio was destroyed to make way for a Wal-Mart in Houghton Lake many years ago. The station previous broadcast from the top of Mid Michigan Community College in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. WUPS recently changed its city of license from Houghton Lake to Harrison with no change in transmitter location or signal. To maintain local radio service to Houghton Lake, country music sister station WTWS (The Twister) moved to Houghton Lake.

Guidelines Any American high school student (or middle school, though the competition may be too challenging for all but the brightest of these) may compete in a team of up to five people. Students are not required to be students of the same school, or even residents of the same state. Because of the decentralized nature of the competition, an advisor such as a teacher of a guardian is required for each team to monitor the team and vouch for compliance with the competition's rules. No computer or calculator programs or applications are allowed on the iTest, though graphing calculator use is allowed. Format Prior to 2008, it had consisted of 25 multiple-choice questions (with 1 answer choice on the first problem, 2 on the second, etc.), 25 short-answer questions, and 10 \\"Ultimate\\" questions, which are much like relay questions in that each Ultimate question depends on the answer to the previous ones. In 2008, it consisted only of 100 multiple choice or short answer problems. There were 4 Tiebreaker proof questions up until 2008 - in the 2008 competition, ties were solely broken by submission time.  Participation  Students from 44 states have participated in the iTest, including home school students. In 2005, the iTest admitted the American School of Warsaw in Poland as part of a pilot program to open the competition to international schools. Naming When the iTest was founded in 2004, it was named the American High School Internet Mathematics Competition, as mentioned before. However, the iTest soon became its nickname, and the competition officially adopted the name in 2007.  Prizes  The iTest offers a different prize each year, attempting to reward the top students with cutting edge technology. * In 2004, each student on the winning team was awarded their choice of a Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation 2, or Nintendo GameCube. * In 2005, each participant of the winning team was given an Apple iPod nano. * In 2006, each member of the winning team received a Wii, Nintendo DS Lite, and a copy of Brain Age.

All the processors in the UMA model share the physical memory uniformly. In an UMA architecture, access time to a memory location is independent of which processor makes the request or which memory chip contains the transferred data. Uniform memory access computer architectures are often contrasted with non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. In the UMA architecture, each processor may use a private cache. Peripherals are also shared in some fashion. The UMA model is suitable for general purpose and time sharing applications by multiple users. It can be used to speed up the execution of a single large program in time-critical applications.Advanced Computer Architecture, Kai Hwang, Types of architectures There are three types of UMA architectures: * UMA using bus-based symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architectures; * UMA using crossbar switches; * UMA using multistage interconnection networks. hUMA In April 2013, the term hUMA (heterogeneous uniform memory access) began to appear in AMD promotional material to refer to CPU and GPU sharing the same system memory via cache coherent views.

Palestinian community in Kuwait Significant demographic changes occurred in Kuwait as a result of the Gulf War. There were 400,000 Palestinians in Kuwait before the Gulf War. During the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, 200,000 Palestinians left Kuwait due to various reasons (fear or persecution, food shortages, medical care difficulties, financial shortages, fear of arrest and mistreatment at roadblocks by Iraqis). After the Gulf War of 1991, nearly 200,000 Palestinians fled Kuwait, partly due to economic burdens, regulations on residence and fear of abuse by Kuwaiti security forces. Kuwait's lack of support for Palestinians after the Gulf War was a response to the alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein, who had earlier invaded Kuwait. On March 14, 1991, 200,000 Palestinians were still residing in Kuwait, out of initial 400,000.AFTER THE WAR: Kuwait; Palestinians in Kuwait Face Suspicion and Probable Exile - New York Times Palestinians began leaving Kuwait during one week in March 1991, following Kuwait's liberation from Iraqi occupation. During a single week in March, the Palestinian population of Kuwait had almost entirely fled the country. Kuwaitis said that Palestinians leaving the country could move to Jordan, since most Palestinians held Jordanian passports. According to the New York Times, Kuwaitis said the anger against Palestinians was such that there was little chance that those who had left during the seven-month occupation could ever return and relatively few of those remaining will be able to stay. The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were mostly Jordanian citizens. Only in 2004, the political situation between Kuwaiti and Palestinian leadership improved with official apology of Mahmud Abbas on PLO support of the Iraqi invasion in 1991. In 2012, the official Palestinian embassy in Kuwait was re-opened. In 2012, 80,000 Palestinians lived in Kuwait. Gulf War syndrome Many returning Coalition soldiers reported illnesses following their action in the war, a phenomenon known as Gulf War syndrome or Gulf War illness. Common symptoms that were reported are chronic fatigue, Fibromyalgia, and Gastrointestinal disorder. There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the reported birth defects. Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects. Gulf War veterans' children born after the war had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war. Researchers have said that they did not have enough information to link birth defects with exposure to toxic substances. Some factors considered as possibilities include exposure to depleted uranium, chemical weapons, anthrax vaccines given to deploying soldiers, and/or infectious diseases. Major Michael Donnelly, a USAF officer during the War, helped publicize the syndrome and advocated for veterans' rights in this regard. Effects of depleted uranium Approximate area and major clashes in which DU rounds were used. Depleted uranium was used in the war in tank kinetic energy penetrators and 20‚Äì30 mm cannon ordnance. Significant controversy regarding the long term safety of depleted uranium exists, although detractors claim pyrophoric, genotoxic, and teratogenic heavy metal effects. Many have cited its use during the war as a contributing factor to a number of instances of health issues in the conflict's veterans and surrounding civilian populations. However, scientific opinion on the risk is mixed. Some say that depleted uranium is not a significant health hazard unless it is taken into the body. External exposure to radiation from depleted uranium is generally not a major concern because the alpha particles emitted by its isotopes travel only a few centimeters in air or can be stopped by a sheet of paper. Also, the uranium-235 that remains in depleted uranium emits only a small amount of low-energy gamma radiation. However, if allowed to enter the body, depleted uranium, like natural uranium, has the potential for both chemical and radiological toxicity with the two important target organs being the kidneys and the lungsDepleted Uranium Health Effects .

Highway of Death On the night of 26‚Äì27 February 1991, some Iraqi forces began leaving Kuwait on the main highway north of Al Jahra in a column of some 1,400 vehicles. A patrolling E-8 Joint STARS aircraft observed the retreating forces and relayed the information to the DDM-8 air operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. These vehicles and the retreating soldiers were subsequently attacked, resulting in a 60 km stretch of highway strewn with debris‚Äîthe Highway of Death. New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd wrote, \\"With the Iraqi leader facing military defeat, Mr. Bush decided that he would rather gamble on a violent and potentially unpopular ground war than risk the alternative: an imperfect settlement hammered out by the Soviets and Iraqis that world opinion might accept as tolerable.\\" Chuck Horner, Commander of U.S. and allied air operations has written: =Bulldozer assault= An armored bulldozer similar to the ones used in the attack. Another incident during the war highlighted the question of large-scale Iraqi combat deaths. This was the \\"bulldozer assault\\", wherein two brigades from the U.S. 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) were faced with a large and complex trench network, as part of the heavily fortified \\"Saddam Hussein Line\\". After some deliberation, they opted to use anti-mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers. Not a single American was killed during the attack. Reporters were banned from witnessing the attack, near the neutral zone that touches the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Every American in the assault was inside an armored vehicle. One newspaper story reported that U.S. commanders estimated thousands of Iraqi soldiers surrendered, escaping live burial during the two-day assault 24‚Äì26 February 1991. Patrick Day of Newsday reported, \\"Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Vulcan armored carriers straddled the trench lines and fired into the Iraqi soldiers as the tanks covered them with mounds of sand. 'I came through right after the lead company,' [Col. Anthony] Moreno said. 'What you saw was a bunch of buried trenches with peoples' arms and things sticking out of them... However, after the war, the Iraqi government said that only 44 bodies were found. In his book The Wars Against Saddam, John Simpson alleges that U.S. forces attempted to cover up the incident. After the incident, the commander of the 1st Brigade said: \\"I know burying people like that sounds pretty nasty, but it would be even nastier if we had to put our troops in the trenches and clean them out with bayonets.\\" Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney did not mention the First Division's tactics in an interim report to Congress on Operation Desert Storm. In the report, Cheney acknowledged that 457 enemy soldiers were buried during the ground war. Coalition bombing of Iraq's civilian infrastructure In the 23 June 1991 edition of The Washington Post, reporter Bart Gellman wrote: \\"Many of the targets were chosen only secondarily to contribute to the military defeat of [Iraq] ... Military planners hoped the bombing would amplify the economic and psychological impact of international sanctions on Iraqi society ... They deliberately did great harm to Iraq's ability to support itself as an industrial society ...\\" In the Jan/Feb 1995 edition of Foreign Affairs, French diplomat Eric Rouleau wrote: \\"[T]he Iraqi people, who were not consulted about the invasion, have paid the price for their government's madness ... Iraqis understood the legitimacy of a military action to drive their army from Kuwait, but they have had difficulty comprehending the Allied rationale for using air power to systematically destroy or cripple Iraqi infrastructure and industry: electric power stations (92 percent of installed capacity destroyed), refineries (80 percent of production capacity), petrochemical complexes, telecommunications centers (including 135 telephone networks), bridges (more than 100), roads, highways, railroads, hundreds of locomotives and boxcars full of goods, radio and television broadcasting stations, cement plants, and factories producing aluminum, textiles, electric cables, and medical supplies.\\" However, the U.N. subsequently spent billions rebuilding hospitals, schools, and water purification facilities throughout the country. Abuse of Coalition POWs During the conflict, Coalition aircrew shot down over Iraq were displayed as prisoners of war on TV, most with visible signs of abuse. Amongst several testimonies to poor treatment, Air Force Captain, Richard Storr was allegededly tortured by Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War. Iraqi secret police broke his nose, dislocated his shoulder and punctured his eardrum.Patrice O'Shaughness. \\"Gulf War POW denounces abuse of Iraqi detainees\\". New York Daily News.

Nichol and Peters were forced to make statements against the war in front of television cameras.

Only one, Chris Ryan, evaded capture while the group's other surviving members were violently tortured.The One that Got Away by Chris Ryan & Bravo Two Zero by Andy McNab Flight surgeon (later General) Rhonda Cornum was raped by one of her captors after the Black Hawk she was riding in was shot down while searching for a downed F-16 pilot. =Operation Southern Watch= Since the war, the U.S. has had a continued presence of 5,000 troops stationed in Saudi Arabia ‚Äì a figure that rose to 10,000 during the 2003 conflict in Iraq. Operation Southern Watch enforced the no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991; oil exports through the Persian Gulf's shipping lanes were protected by the Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet. Since Saudi Arabia houses Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest sites, many Muslims were upset at the permanent military presence. The continued presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia after the war was one of the stated motivations behind the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Khobar Towers bombing, and the date chosen for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings (7 August), which was eight years to the day that U.S. troops were sent to Saudi Arabia.Plotz, David (2001) What Does Osama Bin Laden Want?, Slate Osama bin Laden interpreted the Islamic prophet Muhammad as banning the \\"permanent presence of infidels in Arabia\\". In 1996, bin Laden issued a fatwa, calling for U.S. troops to leave Saudi Arabia. In a December 1999 interview with Rahimullah Yusufzai, bin Laden said he felt that Americans were \\"too near to Mecca\\" and considered this a provocation to the entire Islamic world. Sanctions On 6 August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 661 which imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, providing for a full trade embargo, excluding medical supplies, food and other items of humanitarian necessity, these to be determined by the Council's sanctions committee. From 1991 until 2003, the effects of government policy and sanctions regime led to hyperinflation, widespread poverty and malnutrition. During the late 1990s, the U.N. considered relaxing the sanctions imposed because of the hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis. Studies dispute the number of people who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions. =Draining of the Qurna Marshes= The draining of the Qurna Marshes was an irrigation project in Iraq during and immediately after the war, to drain a large area of marshes in the Tigris‚ÄìEuphrates river system. Formerly covering an area of around 3,000 square kilometers, the large complex of wetlands were almost completely emptied of water, and the local Shi'ite population relocated, following the war and 1991 uprisings. By 2000, United Nations Environment Programme estimated that 90% of the marshlands had disappeared, causing desertification of over . The draining of the Qurna Marshes also called The Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes occurred in Iraq and to a smaller degree in Iran between the 1950s and 1990s to clear large areas of the marshes in the Tigris- Euphrates river system. Formerly covering an area of around 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi), the large complex ofwetlands was 90% drained prior to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. The marshes are typically divided into three main sub- marshes, the Hawizeh, Central, and Hammar Marshes and all three were drained at different times for different reasons. Initial draining of the Central Marshes was intended to reclaim land for agriculture but later all three marshes would become a tool of war and revenge. Many international organizations such as the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, the Wetlands International, and Middle East Watch have described the project as a political attempt to force the Marsh Arabs out of the area through water diversion tactics. Oil spill On 23 January, Iraq dumped of crude oil into the Persian Gulf , causing the largest offshore oil spill in history at that time. It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep U.S. Marines from coming ashore (Missouri and Wisconsin had shelled Failaka Island during the war to reinforce the idea that there would be an amphibious assault attempt). About 30‚Äì40% of this came from allied raids on Iraqi coastal targets. Kuwaiti oil fires Oil well fires rage outside Kuwait City in 1991 The Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by the Iraqi military setting fire to 700 oil wells as part of a scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by Coalition forces. The fires started in January and February 1991 and the last one was extinguished by November 1991. The resulting fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews. Land mines had been placed in areas around the oil wells, and a military cleaning of the areas was necessary before the fires could be put out. Somewhere around of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of US$1.5 billion to Kuwait. By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately ten months, causing widespread pollution. =Environmental impact= An oilfield on fire Immediately following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, predictions were made of an environmental disaster stemming from Iraqi threats to blow up captured Kuwaiti oil wells. Speculation ranging from a nuclear winter type scenario, to heavy acid rain and even short term immediate global warming were presented at the World Climate Conference in Geneva that November.KUWAITI OIL FIRES - MODELING REVISITEDWilmington morning Star January 21'st, 1991 On 10 January 1991, a paper appearing in the Journal Nature, stated Paul Crutzen's calculations that the setting alight of the Kuwait oil wells would produce a \\"nuclear winter\\", with a cloud of smoke covering half of the Northern Hemisphere after 100 days had passed and beneath the cloud, temperatures would be reduced by 5-10 Celsius. This was followed by articles printed in the Wilmington morning star and the Baltimore Sun newspapers in mid to late January 1991, with the popular TV scientist personality of the time, Carl Sagan, who was also the co-author of the first few nuclear winter papers along with Richard P. Turco, John W. Birks, Alan Robock and Paul Crutzen together collectively stated that they expected catastrophic nuclear winter like effects with continental sized impacts of \\"sub-freezing\\" temperatures as a result of if the Iraqis went through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells and they burned for a few months. Later when Operation Desert Storm had begun, Dr. S. Fred Singer and Carl Sagan discussed the possible environmental impacts of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the ABC News program Nightline. Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with smoke lofting into the stratosphere, a region of the atmosphere beginning around above sea level at Kuwait, resulting in global effects and that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the explosion of the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the Year Without a Summer. He reported on initial modeling estimates that forecast impacts extending to south Asia, and perhaps to the northern hemisphere as well. Singer, on the other hand, said that calculations showed that the smoke would go to an altitude of about and then be rained out after about three to five days and thus the lifetime of the smoke would be limited. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer's narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Persian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general, lofting to about and a few times as high as . Along with Singer's televised critique, Richard D. Small criticized the initial Nature paper in a reply on 7 March 1991 arguing along similar lines as Singer. Sagan later conceded in his book The Demon-Haunted World that his prediction did not turn out to be correct: \\"it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4‚Äì6 ¬∞C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared.\\" At the peak of the fires, the smoke absorbed 75 to 80% of the sun's radiation. The particles rose to a maximum of , but were scavenged by cloud condensation nuclei from the atmosphere relatively quickly. Sagan and his colleagues expected that a \\"self-lofting\\" of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun's heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere where it would take years for the sun blocking effect of this aerosol of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural impacts in Asia and possibly the Northern Hemisphere as a whole. In retrospect, it is now known that smoke from the Kuwait oil fires only affected the weather pattern throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991, with lower atmospheric winds blowing the smoke along the eastern half of the Arabian Peninsula, and cities such as Dhahran and Riyadh, and countries such as Bahrain experienced days with smoke filled skies and carbon soot rainout/fallout. Thus the immediate consequence of the arson sabotage was a dramatic regional decrease in air quality, causing respiratory problems for many Kuwaitis and those in neighboring countries. According to the 1992 study from Peter Hobbs and Lawrence Radke daily emissions of sulfur dioxide (which can generate acid rain) were 57% of that from electric utilities in the United States, emissions of carbon dioxide were 2% of global emissions and emissions of soot were 3400 metric tons per day. In a paper in the DTIC archive, published in 2000, it states that \\"Calculations based on smoke from Kuwaiti oil fires in May and June of 1991 indicate that combustion efficiency was about 96% in producing carbon dioxide. While, with respect to the incomplete combustion fraction, Smoke particulate matter accounted for 2% of the fuel burned, of which 0.4% was soot.\\"[With the remaining 2%, being oil that did not undergo any initial combustion]. Peter V. Hobbs also narrated a short amateur documentary titled Kuwait Oil Fires that followed the University of Washington/UW's \\"Cloud and Aerosol Research Group\\" as they flew through, around and above the smoke clouds and took samples, measurements, and video of the smoke clouds in their Convair C-131(N327UW) Aerial laboratory.

He retired from touring in 2007 as a result of being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was the middle brother of Toto members Jeff Porcaro and Steve Porcaro. Their father was jazz drummer-percussionist Joe Porcaro. Early life Mike Porcaro is the second of the three Porcaro brothers. The three brothers were taught drums by their father at his drum shop every weekend. Jeff said that he himself wasn't the best drummer, adding that Mike was a better player than him before he switched to bass, while Steve later took up piano before they moved to California. Jeff explained that when the brothers took guitar lessons, Mike took off at the instrument while Jeff gave up after three lessons, and since the family had only one drum kit and one bass, Mike was assigned the bass. Mike Porcaro was also a member of the Baha'i Faith Career Porcaro worked as a session bass player before replacing Toto original bass player David Hungate in 1982 shortly after the band completed recording the Toto IV album. Porcaro played cello on a track for the album and subsequently appeared in the band's videos and performed as a full band member on the world tour in support of the album. He remained with the band until 2007. Along with Toto, Porcaro played numerous sessions in Los Angeles, and toured with Michael Franks on his first tour. He then toured with Seals and Crofts, Larry Carlton, and Boz Scaggs. He appears in the video for the song \\"JoJo\\" by Scaggs. In Flames bass player Peter Iwers said that his bass playing style was influenced by Porcaro. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and death Porcaro stopped performing with Toto in 2007 after experiencing a growing weakness in his fingers that was making it increasingly difficult for him to play. He was replaced by Leland Sklar for the remainder of the tour and Toto disbanded in 2008. In February 2010, it was announced that Porcaro was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and that former band members of Toto, including Steve Porcaro, would reform and do a short tour through Europe in support of him in the summer of 2010. The regrouped Toto continued to tour and perform for Mike's benefit during 2011. In September 2012, it was reported in Classic Rock magazine that he was doing as well as could be expected with his disease, but he was in a wheelchair as the disease was progressing. Porcaro died at his Los Angeles home on March 15, 2015, at the age of 59, from complications of ALS. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

The program's aim was to enable students to enhance their writing skills. Overview The series revolved around R.B. Bugg, an anthropomorphic insect who's a young television reporter for Channel 85, WORD-TV (outer building in real life is home to Mississippi Public Broadcasting/MPB) in the fictional city of Egg City, Calistonia (which in reality is Jackson, Mississippi). Despite being a reporter for WORD's news department, R.B. Bugg's writing skills aren't as sharp‚Äîhe writes in short, choppy sentences. His news director, Red Green (no relation to the later Canadian television character of the same name), was played by Beverly Todd,http://www.retrojunk.com/community/post/index/61 Throughout the series, she shows him how to combine and improve his writings. By way of animation, viewers see a gloved hand moving words, combining words and making appropriate changes in capitalization and punctuation. Later in the show Bugg writes another story, only this time he does this without Green's help, and at the house where he lives. It re-enforces to the viewer what Green showed R.B. earlier, but without the gloved hand. Nevertheless, the corrections were still made on screen. Each episode usually concluded with Bugg falling asleep in front of the television, as WORD signs off with the Star Spangled Banner, the US national anthem. The Club The final segment in each episode is usually The Club, whose slogan was Palabra jot, palabra jot - faux Latin for write words (\\"palabra\\" is Spanish for \\"word\\"; and \\"jot\\" is an English synonym for \\"write\\").

He was one of the greatest keyboard virtuosos of his time, and transcribed or arranged several Italian motets and madrigals by such composers as Lassus, Palestrina, and Giulio Caccini for his instruments. Some of his keyboard works are found in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. Philips also wrote many sacred choral works. Life Philips began his musical career at St Paul's Cathedral in London Philips was born in 1560 or 1561, possibly in Devonshire or London. From 1572 to 1578 he began his career as a boy chorister at St Paul's Cathedral in London, under the aegis of the Catholic master of choristers, Sebastian Westcott (died 1582), who had also trained the young William Byrd some twenty years earlier. Philips must have had a close relationship with his master, as he lodged in his house up to the time of Westcote's death, and was a beneficiary of his will. In the same year (1582), Philips left England for good, like so many others for reasons of his Catholicism, and stayed briefly in Flanders before travelling to Rome where he entered the service of Alessandro Farnese (1520‚Äì1589), with whom he stayed for three years, and was also engaged as organist at the English Jesuit College. It was here that in February 1585 he met a fellow Catholic exile, Thomas, third Baron Paget (c. 1544‚Äì1590). Philips entered Paget's service as a musician, and the two left Rome in March 1585, travelling over several years to Genoa, Madrid, Paris, Brussels and finally Antwerp, where Philips settled in 1590 and where Paget died the same year. After settling, Philips married and gained a precarious living by teaching the virginals to children. In 1593 he went to Amsterdam \\"to sie and heare an excellent man of his faculties\\", doubtless Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, whose reputation had by then long been made. On his way back, Philips was denounced by a compatriot for complicity in a plot on Queen Elizabeth's life, and he was temporarily imprisoned at the Hague, where he probably composed the pavan and galliard Doloroso (Fitzwilliam Virginal Book nos. LXXX and LXXXI). Philips himself translated the accusations made against him during his trial, revealing that he could by then speak Dutch. He was acquitted and released without further charges. In 1597 Philips was appointed organist to the chapel of Albert VII, Archduke of Austria at the Coudenberg Palace in Brussels Philips' fortunes took a turn for the better on his return, and in 1597 he was employed in Brussels as organist to the chapel of Albert VII, Archduke of Austria who had been appointed governor of the Low Countries in 1595. Here, after his wife ‚Äì and child's ‚Äì deaths, he was ordained a priest in either 1601 or 1609 ‚Äì opinions differ; in any case, he received a canonry at Soignies in 1610, and another at B√©thune in 1622 or 1623. In his position at court, Philips was able to meet the best musicians of the time, including Girolamo Frescobaldi, who visited the Low Countries in 1607‚Äì1608, and his fellow-countryman John Bull, who had fled England on a charge of adultery. His nearest colleague, however, was Peeter Cornet (c. 1575‚Äì1633), organist to Archduchess Isabella, wife of Philips' employer the archduke. Philips died in 1628, probably in Brussels, where he was buried. Works The score of Philips' Cantiones Sacrae (1613) Philips was an extremely prolific composer: his surviving motets number in the hundreds, and he also composed both instrumental and consort music. His keyboard pieces are mostly in the tradition of the English virginalist school, but his choral works, although retaining occasional English characteristics, are largely in the style of more conservative Italian contemporary composers such as Giovanni Croce. *Works in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: The earliest surviving piece we know to be by Philips is a pavan dated 1580 in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (no. LXXXV). It bears the note: The first one Phi[lips] made. It was the subject of a magnificent set of variations by Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck entitled Pavana Philippi, a version by Thomas Morley, and survives in arrangements for consort and lute. Of Philip's 27 known keyboard pieces (excluding doubtful works) ‚Äì pavans, galliards, fantasias and settings of Italian masters ‚Äì no fewer than nineteen are included in the same collection. The probable compiler of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, Francis Tregian the Younger, a fellow Catholic, was almost certainly acquainted with Philips: both men were at the court of Brussels in 1603, and Tregian may well have been responsible for importing Philips' works to England. The pavan Doloroso (no. LXXX) appears to be dedicated to Tregian, bearing the title Pauana Doloroso. Treg[ian], and there is also a Pavana Pagget with its galliard, dated 1590 and no doubt written on the death of his patron, Lord Thomas Paget. Many of the pieces are settings of Italian composers, and in some Philips' name is spelled the Flemish way: Peeter suggesting that the scribe ‚Äì possibly Tregian himself ‚Äì was copying from continental manuscripts. *Other works: 1591: Philips' publisher in Antwerp, Pierre Phal√®se the Younger (1550‚Äì1629), printed his collection of madrigals entitled Melodia Olympica, followed by further editions in 1594 and 1611. 1596: Philips published his Primo Libro de Madrigali a sei voci, a book of madrigals for six voices. 1598: A further book of madrigals for eight voices published. 1603: Another set of madrigals for six voices published. 1612: The first set of Cantiones Sacrae for five voices printed by Phal√®se. 1613: A second set of Cantiones Sacrae Octonis Vocibus for double chorus of eight voices. 1613: Gemmulae Sacrae Binis et Ternis Vocibus cum Basso Continuo Organum. 1615: 3 Trios (without instrumentation) in L'Institution Harmonique by Salomon De Caus, Frankfurt 1616: Les Rossignols spirituels published, two and four- part arrangements of popular songs adapted to sacred texts in Latin and French. 1616: Deliciae sacrae binis et ternis vocibus cum basso continuo organum. 1623: Litanies to Loreto. 1628: Paradisus sacris cantionibus consitus, una, duabus et tribus vocibus decantantis.

Distribution The Florida bog frog inhabits a total area of less than 20 km2 (7.7 mi2). It is found in shallow ponds or creeks along tributaries of the East Bay, Shoal and Yellow Rivers in Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, and Walton Counties in Florida. About 90% of its range lies within Eglin Air Force Base, so the major threat to this species originates from human activity disturbing their natural habitat. However, \\"US national security has priority over wildlife\\", and the species showed some tolerance to intrusion. Description This species ranges from in snout to vent length (SVL), with females being a few millimeters larger than males on average. They have no spots on their dorsal surfaces and compared to other North American members of the genus Lithobates, the webbing between the toes is greatly reduced. They are light green. Males have a yellow throat and larger tympana. Tadpoles are brown with dark spots on the tail and light spots on the ventral surface. The Florida bog frog differs from other American frogs by reduced webbing of their feet ‚Äì \\"at least three phalanges of the 4th toe are free of webbing and at least two phalanges of all other toes are free\\".Al Nasa'a, M' (2003) Rana okaloosae, Animal Diversity Web. Accessed March 10, 2006 Habitat Florida Bog Frogs occupy sluggish backwaters and seepages associated with clear, sand-bottomed streams. They prefer relatively open mucky areas that are thickly vegetated with low-lying herbaceous plant species, and are especially fond of areas dominated by sphagnum. The structure of their preferred microhabitats are maintained by the regular intrusion of fire and they will abandon habitats that become thickly overgrown with woody shrubs. Suppression of hot summer fires that enter wooded stream bottoms has led to the loss and degradation of much of the species' historic breeding habitat. Ecology and behavior This species was unknown to science until the 1982, when it was discovered by State of Florida herpetologist Paul Moler while conducting surveys for the Pine Barrens Treefrog (Hyla andersonii). Relatively little is known about their reproduction and development. Males call at night during the summer months, often in areas where bronze frogs (Lithobates clamitans clamitans) also breed. Females lay several hundred eggs at a time on the surface of shallow, non-stagnant, acidic (pH 4.1‚Äì5.5) water during the spring and summer. Tadpoles metamorphose by the next spring.

Design There were a number of engineering challenges to overcome in designing an autoloading .22 WMR handgun such as extraction problems. The extraction problems stem from the fact that the slow burning rifle powder of the .22 WMR cartridge develops a late peak pressure. This can cause the case mouth to expand and jam in the chamber when fired from a handgun. AMT overcame this issue by drilling 18 holes at 90 degrees to the chamber. A sleeve was then welded over the chamber; providing a tiny amount of clearance for the excess gas to escape from the first set of holes on back to the second set, thereby relieving the pressure enough to prevent the case from sticking. The stainless steel slide has a large cutout over the barrel, similar to the Beretta M9, to facilitate better cooling and ejection of the spent brass casing (more likely it is simply to reduce the moving mass of the slide to allow for the blow-back operation). The stainless steel construction throughout makes rust a non-issue.

This article outlines the early history of the industry. Printing Music publishing did not begin on a large scale until the mid-15th century, when mechanical techniques for printing music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of liturgical chants, dates from about 1465, shortly after the Gutenberg Bible. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. This was a very labor-intensive and time-consuming process, so it was first undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve sacred music for the church. The few collections of secular music that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy noblemen. Examples include the Squarcialupi Codex of Italian Trecento music and the Chantilly Codex of French Ars subtilior music. Hand copying persisted long after the invention of printing and music was widely disseminated in manuscript form well into the 18th century, both in personal copying and scribal publication. Odhecaton =Petrucci= The father of modern music printing was Ottaviano Petrucci, a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year monopoly on printed music in Venice during the 16th century. His first collection was entitled Harmonice Musices Odhecaton and contained 96 polyphonic compositions, mostly by Josquin des Prez and Heinrich Isaac. He flourished by focusing on Flemish works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the Renaissance. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean results, though it was time-consuming and expensive. =Rastell= Around 1520 in England, John Rastell developed a single-impression method for printing music.J. A. Bernstein, Music Printing in Renaissance Venice: The Scotto Press, 1539‚Äì1572 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 27. With his method, the staff lines, words and notes were all part of a single piece of type, making it much easier to produce. However, this method produced messier results, as the staff lines were often inexactly aligned and looked wavy on the page. The single-impression method eventually triumphed over Petrucci's, however, and became the dominant mode of printing until copper- plate engraving took over in the 17th century. This method was adopted and used widely by a Frenchman, Pierre Attaingnant. Copyright First page from the \\"Statute of Anne\\" The concept of musical copyright had its beginnings in the reign of King Henry VIII of England who required copies of all printed matter to be sent to him and offered protection to printers in the form of licenses, primarily to produce a new source of revenue. In 1575 Elizabeth I granted Thomas Tallis and his pupil William Byrd a 21-year patent monopoly on the printing and publishing of polyphonic music.J. P. Wainright, 'England ii, 1603‚Äì1642' in J. Haar, ed., European Music, 1520‚Äì1640 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2006), pp. 509-21. The first modern copyright law was the Statute of Anne (1709), which protected all published works for a period of fourteen years, later extended to twenty-eight years. The earliest attempt at a printed musical copyright notice appears in the \\"Shir Hashirim\\" of Salomone Rossi (Venice, 1623) which includes a rabbinical curse on those infringing the text, written by Leon of Modena. =1886 Berne Convention= The first international agreement involving copyright was the Berne Convention of 1886. The core principle of the Convention is its provision that each of the contracting countries shall provide automatic protection for works in all other countries of the union and for unpublished works whose authors are citizens of or residents in those countries. Performance rights are included in these provisions. As of March 2012, 165 countries had become parties to the convention. =United States= The first U.S. federal copyright law gave protections to \\"maps, charts, and books.\\" Contrary to some scholarly accounts, the 1790 Act's protection of \\"books\\" did encompass musical compositions.Clayton v. Stone, 5 F. Cas. 999, 1000 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1829) (‚ÄúA book [within the Copyright Act of 1790 can be] a volume made up of several sheets bound together; it may be printed only on one sheet, as the words of a song or the music accompanying it‚Äù) The first registration in the U.S. for a musical composition was made on January 6, 1794 by Raynor Taylor for the original song \\"The Kentucky Volunteer.\\"William F. Patry, Copyright Law and Practice 30 n.91 (2000) (‚ÄúThe first registration for a musical composition was made on January 6, 1794, for The Kentucky Volunteer: A New Song, written by ‚Äòa lady of Philadelphia.‚Äô The composer is believed to have been Raynor Taylor.‚Äù) (citing Federal Copyright Records 1790‚Äì1800 at 15 (1987)). However, musical compositions were not explicitly protected until the Copyright Act of 1831, and then protection remained limited to reproduction rights. The copyright term was twenty-eight years plus a fourteen-year renewal period. Performing rights Fa√ßade of 10 Rue Chaptal, first home of SACEM While England was a leader in the development of copyright, the French led the way in performing rights. In 1777, Pierre de Beaumarchais founded the \\"Bureau de Legislation Dramatique\\" which became the present Soci√©t√© des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques (SACD) in 1829. Many years later, in 1847, this inspired the composer and librettist Ernest Bourget to claim payment for each performance of his works at Les Ambassadeurs, a leading Caf√©-concert venue of that time. A lawsuit won by Bourget and others in 1851 led to the formation of the Soci√©t√© des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique (SACEM) ‚Äì the first performing rights society in the world. Other countries followed suit: The Italian Societ√† Italiana degli Autori ed Editori (SIAE) was founded in 1882 and the Spanish \\"Sociedad de Autores\\", predecessor of the current Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE), in 1899. The predecessor to the Gesellschaft f√ºr Musikalische Auff√ºhrungs und Mechanische Vervielf√§ltigungsrechte (GEMA) was formed in Germany by composer Richard Strauss in 1903. It became GEMA in 1915 when it merged with another small society. So, by the end of the 19th century, the foundation had been laid for the modern music publishing industry. Early modern era: 18th century =German publishers= As England was a leader in developing copyright systems and France was ahead in developing performing rights, Germany was the pioneering country in modern music publishing. The first German music publishing enterprises date from the 18th century. Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf of Leipzig, a printer and general publisher, decided to specialize in music printing as of 1754. He became successful by developing improvements in the setting of music type. Gottfried Christoph H√§rtel joined the firm in 1795, which soon became the partnership of Breitkopf & H√§rtel. They were the original publishers for a who's-who of great German composers, including Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Wagner. Schott Music of Mainz was founded in 1770 by Bernhard Schott and still exists today. They specialized in French and Italian operas and, more recently, have published works by Hindemith, Stravinsky, Orff, Schoenberg and Henze. N. Simrock of Bonn, and later Berlin, was established in 1790 by Nikolaus Simrock. Their original publications included works by Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Weber, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms. =United States of America= In 1764, Josiah Flagg compiled the first collection of popular and religious music, printed on paper made in the colonies. The post-revolutionary period was notable for the arrival of the first professional music publishers from Europe in the 1770s. They opened shops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston and Baltimore, bringing with them European technology. Benjamin Carr and James Hewitt were two important early American music publishers. The first song published under US copyright was The Kentucky Volunteer, by Carr's own house. In the first quarter of the 19th century alone, 10,000 pieces of popular music were printed by U.S. publishers. The industry, however, did nothing to promote music or develop writers. Songs became popular by word-of-mouth. Most minstrel troupes and professional singers wrote their own music or had songs written to order. Stephen Foster was the first composer who tried to make a living as an independent professional songwriter but, in the 1850s, copyright protection was so lax and royalties so small (or non-existent) that he found himself living in poverty. This changed only gradually as young men involved in other business enterprises began to perceive the possibilities for enrichment in song publishing. Sheet music for \\"After the Ball\\" Prior to the 1880s, popular music publishing was a secondary function of music stores or \\"serious\\" (Classical) music publishers. After 1880, publishers in New York developed a promotional technique called plugging. By 1900, most music publishers had clustered their businesses along 28th St. (between 6th Ave. and Broadway) in order to be closer to New York's thriving entertainment center. This area came to be known as Tin Pan Alley. The first decade of the 20th century saw the production of more popular music than had ever been written up to that time: about 25,000 songs annually. In 1893, sheet music for the song \\"After the Ball\\" sold one million copies and, over the next ten years, went on to sell a total of ten million. Despite the enactment of new U.S. copyright legislation, including the 1891 Chace Act, which allowed for the international protection of copyrights, the provisions of the 1909 Copyright Act were generally ignored. To correct this situation, operetta composer Victor Herbert established the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), in 1914. It quickly attracted prominent composers such as Irving Berlin and John Philip Sousa, and was able to ensure that everyone was properly paid and credited for their work.  Licensing  There are many aspects to music publishing. Chief among them is the licensing of music for use in advertising, television, films and other purposes. Music publishing started out by just being the publishing of the actual sheet music, and not even the score. Song sheets were made which just had the lyrics of a popular song. In the 19th century, sheet music for songs began including a simple piano accompaniment and notation for the song's melody. In the 2010s, music publishing is the exploitation of compositions (songs, instrumental pieces, and other music) for various performance uses, including newer uses such as licensing for video games, for use by recording artists looking for their next hit single and for use in a range of licensing purposes. =Licenses= Within music publishing there are many different types of licenses. For instance: *Blanket license *Mechanical license *Performing Rights License (PRO) *Synchronization License or Sync Rights A blanket license is an annual fee paid to one of the key performing rights organizations (PRO) (SESAC, ASCAP, or BMI). The blanket license paid to the PRO covers every work that is in the PRO's catalog. Blanket licenses are mostly used by television networks and radio stations so that they have the right to play any song or piece from one catalog instead of paying license fees for each song individually.Mark Halloran, Musician's Business & Legal Guide (4th Edition) (Prentice Hall, 2007) A mechanical license is issued when a recording artist wishes to sell their recording of a written composition. It serves as a notice to the composition owners that sales are forthcoming and that royalties dictated by a statutory rate will be owed and paid to them. A Performing Rights License (PRO) is the license that gives the licensee the right to publicly perform the song/work. Lastly, a sync license grants the right to use the composition in the synchronization of a recording over a moving picture in a film, advertisement, television show or any other audiovisual work. For the same synchronization use, one must also obtain a master use license, which grants rights to use the sound recording, which is a separately owned asset from the composition. A music publisher negotiates the uses and fees for the songwriters and composers on their roster. In the 2010s, publishing companies are a main source of revenue besides live touring, because sync licensing has persisted as a substantial income source while the music industry underwent changes that saw their previously dominant income source, record sales, steadily decline. Technologies =Sound recording= The invention and development of sound recording resulted in a redefinition of the concept of publishing, much the same as online music stores in the 2000s would later revolutionize how recordings are purchased. Initially, popular music was slow to take advantage of the new technology. In 1910, when sales of the new disc format exceeded those of the old cylinder, more than 75% of the records sold were classical music. One factor in this may have been the expense, which would have concentrated sales among the more upscale purchasers. Until 1925, sheet music sales continued to surpass discs and were the primary source of revenue for publishers and composers. At that point, sheet music sales began to decline while records were still providing inadequate income to compensate. This led to short lived but serious economic problems for some publishers. =Film music= Samuel Fox (1884‚Äì1971) who founded the Sam Fox Publishing Company in 1906, was the first to publish original film scores.\\"Music Publisher Sam Fox Dies at 89\\"; Associated Press, Daily Mail, Hagerstown, Maryland; Dec. 4, 1971; pg 12. In 1927, after the release of The Jazz Singer (the first talkie), the need for music led movie studios to buy music publishing companies, gaining both catalogues of music and experienced composers at the same time. For example, in 1929, Warner Brothers paid 10 million dollars for Harms, Witmark and Remick; MGM bought Leo Feist Inc. and some smaller companies; Paramount started its own publishing division, Famous Music.

The great majority of fibers connecting the two hemispheres travel through the corpus callosum, which is over 10 times larger than the anterior commissure, and other routes of communication pass through the hippocampal commissure or, indirectly, via subcortical connections. Nevertheless, the anterior commissure is a significant pathway that can be clearly distinguished in the brains of all mammals. The anterior commissure plays a key role in pain sensation, more specifically sharp, acute pain. It also contains decussating fibers from the olfactory tracts, vital for the sense of smell and chemoreception. The anterior commissure works with the posterior commissure to link the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain and also interconnects the amygdalae and temporal lobes, contributing to the role of memory, emotion, speech and hearing. It also is involved in olfaction, instinct, and sexual behavior. In a sagittal section, the anterior commissure is oval in shape, having a long vertical axis that measures about 5 mm. Structure The fibers of the anterior commissure can be traced laterally and posteriorly on either side beneath the striatum into the substance of the temporal lobe. It serves in this way to connect the two temporal lobes, but it also contains decussating fibers from the olfactory tracts, and is a part of the neospinothalamic tract for pain. The anterior commissure also serves to connect the two amygdalae. The corpus callosum allows for communication between the two hemispheres and is found only in placental mammals (the eutherians), while it is absent in monotremes and marsupials, as well as other vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. The anterior commissure serves as the primary mode of interhemispheric communication in marsupials,Ashwell, Ken (2010). The Neurobiology of Australian Marsupials: Brain Evolution in the Other Mammalian Radiation, p. 50Armati, Patricia J., Chris R. Dickman, and Ian D. Hume (2006). Marsupials, p. 175 and which carries all the commissural fibers arising from the neocortex (also known as the neopallium), whereas in placental mammals the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers).Butler, Ann B., and William Hodos (2005). Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation, p. 361 Function Averaged tracking results of ten normal controls showing the Anterior Commissure. Image from Winter and Franz (2014) The functionality of the anterior commissure is still not completely understood. Researchers have implicated it in functions ranging from colour perception to attention. One such study supported colour perception in callosal agenesis (Those born without a corpus callosum; Barr & Corballis, 2002). Other studies have built on this to imply that the anterior commissure can be a compensatory pathway in those without a corpus callosum, presenting diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to better elucidate the anterior commissure and how it might be implicated in various functions (Winter & Franz, 2014). =Sexuality= In 1992 Laura Allen and Roger Gorski of UCLA measured the anterior commissures of 30 homosexual men, 30 heterosexual men, and 30 heterosexual women. They found that all three groups' commissures were significantly different from one another, with homosexual males having the largest anterior commissure, followed by heterosexual women, and then heterosexual men, who had the smallest anterior commissures. In 1993, a review by Byne and Parsons criticized this research, noting that 27 of the 33 homosexual males fell within the range of heterosexual males in the study. However, because range is defined only by the two most extreme data points in a group,http://www.experiment-resources.com/range-in-statistics.html the existence of a single heterosexual male with an exceptionally large anterior commissure for his group (an outlierhttp://www.experiment- resources.com/statistical-outliers.html) would cause this large range irrespective of the data from the rest of the individuals in the group. This individual's existence would not change the fact that the groups on average were quite different from one another, and that these differences were statistically significant. A later report by Byne et al. (2001) noted that > We also measured the anterior commissure in the same blocks of tissue used > for the present hypothalamic study (data not shown) and were unable to > replicate a report [by Allen and Gorski] that its cross-sectional area is > larger in women than in men.

The average size of household as of 2009 was 5.20: 5.20 in rural households and 4.90 in urban areas. The number of households was 132,349: 99,255 in rural areas and 33,094 in urban areas. The number of nomads in the region was 54, 0.01 per cent of the population. There were 682,235 people residing in private households. There were 299,305 over 18 years of age: 138,679 male and 160,626 female. The sex ratio was 94.00 females for every hundred males. There were 683,239 sedentary staff, 6.30 of the population. Sara groups such as the Laka and Ngambay represent more than the 90% of the territory's population. Administration The region of Logone Occidental is divided into four departments, namely, Dodj√© (capital Beinamar), Gu√©ni (capital Krim Krim), Lac Wey (capital Moundou) and Ngourkosso (capital Benoye). As a part of decentralisation in February 2003, the country was administratively split into regions, departments, municipalities and rural communities. The prefectures, which were originally 14 in number, were re- designated into 17 regions. The regions are administered by Governors appointed by the President. The Prefects, who originally held the responsibility of the 14 prefects, still retained the titles and were responsible for the administration of smaller departments in each region. The members of local assemblies are elected every six years, while the executive organs are elected every three years. As of 2016, there are totally 23 regions in Chad, which are divided based on population and administrative convenience.

Their primary product, Wise was one of the most widely used installation packages for Windows. Their main competitor was InstallShield by Flexera Software. Wise Solutions was acquired and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Altiris, Inc. in December 2003. In April 2007, Altiris was acquired by Symantec Corporation. Wise Solutions was started as a shareware tool originally distributed via CompuServe. Over time the company grew to roughly 300 employees spread across the headquarters in Plymouth, Michigan and a European office in The Hague, Netherlands. After the 2003 acquisition by Altiris the European office was consolidated with an existing European Altiris office. The Plymouth Michigan office is now primarily a regional software development and support site for existing Wise branded products and some Altiris branded products.

Legal issues =Corporate espionage= On June 27, 2003, InstallShield sued Wise Solutions, alleging electronic espionage.InstallShield sues competitor Wise Solutions for electronic espionage The civil complaint listed the theft of nearly 1,000 confidential documents from the InstallShield corporate FTP site, including a customer list.InstallSite Tools InstallShield detected the intrusion when decoy customers with addresses planted in InstallShield's customer-list started to receive marketing material from Wise Solutions. Reviews of FTP logs showed several connections over a period of 10 months from addresses related to Wise Solutions. This lawsuit also spawned an investigation by the FBI that resulted in the Plymouth headquarters being searched for evidence. The civil suit was resolved in July 2004 and the case was dismissed. Additionally, the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago sent a letter indicating that they did not intend to file criminal charges. =Patent infringement= In more recent years InstallShield and Wise Solutions via their respective parent companies have had some disagreements over patent infringement, one of which ultimately resulted in a preemptive patent- infringement lawsuit by Macrovision against Altiris and Wise Solutions in which it not only claimed infringement by Altiris products but also asked (November 2006) for the court to find that it was not infringing on any Altiris or Wise Solutions patents.Altiris illegally using technology, suit says - Rod Trent at myITforum.com See also * Installer * List of installation software References External links * Altiris Client Management Suite 7 Install * Lawsuit Documents Software companies of the United States Installation software ","title":"Wise Solutions"},{"id":"4346471","text":"The Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology (HPI) was founded in 1948 by Heinrich Pette, a German neurologist. It began as a research facility to create a polio vaccine. It is now a private foundation and involved with basic research in virology and the immune responses of organisms. The institute is a non-profit public beneficiary organisation and an independent member of the Leibniz Association, and is located at the University of Hamburg. Research The aim of the research at the Heinrich Pette Institute is to develop new approaches for improved diagnostic techniques and therapies for viral diseases and virus-associated tumor diseases. Scholars of the HPI explore a wide range of viruses, such as hepatitis viruses (HPV, HCV), herpes viruses (HSV1, HSV2, EBV, KSHV), leukemia viruses (HTLV -1, MLV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and DNA tumor viruses (adenoviruses, SV 40). The drive towards practical applications of the results in diagnosis and treatment is reflected in numerous collaborations with clinical institutions and industry. The HPI is divided into six research departments, one independent research unit and three independent junior research group. Since May 2020 the HPI also has one assiciated group. The topics of the current working groups are: Research Departments: ‚Ä¢ Antiviral Strategies ‚Ä¢ Structural Biology of Viruses ‚Ä¢ Viral Transformation ‚Ä¢ Virus Immunology ‚Ä¢ Virus-Host-Interaction ‚Ä¢ Viral Zoonoses - One Health Research Unit: ‚Ä¢ Virus Genomics Junior Research Groups: ‚Ä¢ Dynamics of Viral Structures ‚Ä¢ Systems Arbovirology ‚Ä¢ Cell Biology of RNA Viruses Associated Groups: ‚Ä¢ Quantitative Virology History The foundation in 1948 as the \\"Foundation For The Research Of Spinal Polio\\" was made possible by two people: the generous patron Philipp Reemtsma F√ºrchtegott, and the neurologist Heinrich Pette. The latter shaped the scientific concept and development of the institute until his death in 1964. After his death the Institute was renamed 'Heinrich Pette Institute for Experimental Virology and Immunology'. Since 1993 a cooperation agreement between the HPI and the University of Hamburg underlines the close relation to the university. The Institute's buildings were renovated and extended in 1967, 1995 and in 2006. Networks The Heinrich Pette Institute has collaborations on multiple levels with other research institutions. The HPI is a member of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community. It is located on the campus of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and is due to the cooperation agreement linked closely to the University of Hamburg. The heads of departments are C4 or W3 professors, appointed in a procedure closely coordinated with the departments of medicine, chemistry and biology at the University of Hamburg. The HPI alongside the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine and the Research Center Borstel (RCB) is a founding member of the Leibniz Center Infection (LCI). Together, the three institutions harbor around 1,000 employees. The Leibniz Center for Infectious Disease Research aims at inventive and innovative basic research in the region of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein. The research center for pediatric hematology and oncology 'Forschungsinstitut Kinderkrebs-Zentrum Hamburg' has a part of the HPI's buildings. Based on the Public-Private Partnership the Society operates for the promotion of the replacement and expansion II of the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology and is an independent research institute for pediatric hematology and oncology. In cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, scientists proved that it is possible, using a customized enzyme (Tre recombinase), to excise the DNA of the HIV from the genome of individual cells to remove it. This demonstration is an important step in the development of a cure for AIDS (hence the extensive removal or containment of HIV infection).

It is green to brown in color with spots on the dorsal surface. The belly and upper lip are white in color. Individuals can be distinguished from other Rana species by their shorter back legs, narrow snout, and upturned eyes. Since they spend most of their time in the water, they also have more webbing in their hind feet than similar species. Although not threatened, this animal has been studied as a model species for the effects of habitat fragmentation. Description The Columbia spotted frog is a medium-sized frog reaching lengths of up to 3.5 in (90 mm). Its color ranges from a dark, olive green to light brown with irregularly shaped black spots on its back and legs (rendering its name). Its skin texture, like the rest of the genus, varies from a rough to a smooth texture, with small folds of skin along the back. This frog exhibits a unique feature regarding its color. A light-colored strip runs along the upper lip, and the ventral sides of the frog are usually colored either pink or yellow, but only in the adult form. Columbia spotted frog This frog is well known by a few of its physical characteristics, as well. It has a long, narrow out and upturned eyes. The spotted frog is known as a very aquatic amphibian; the webbing on its feet extends all the way to the end of its longest toe. When comparing this frog to others of the same size, such as the northern leopard frog, it tends to have shorter hind legs. The tadpoles are brownish-green in color, which runs dorsally along the tadpole. Gold spots are also intermittent throughout this coloring. The tadpoles have upturned, inset eyes. They usually reach around 3.1 inches (80 mm) in length before maturing to adults. Habitat Example of marsh-like habitat =Geographical location= The Columbia spotted frog is widespread throughout western North America, from Alaska and parts of British Columbia to Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming, Nevada, and Utah. =Habitat= The Columbia spotted frog, like most other frogs, is fairly aquatic. Their habitats are found generally near permanent bodies of water, which can include lakes, ponds, slow-moving streams, and marshes. These frogs were found to need specific habitat characteristics within these broader habitat characteristics. Adult spotted frogs inhabit mostly seasonally flooded sites, where the water source is constant, but at certain times of the year, increases exponentially in both the amount and level of water available. =Vegetation needs= These frogs are a constant victim to predation, so they need to be in an area with an abundant source of low-growing vegetation. A large part of this vegetation is usually submerged, including many forms of algae and other aquatic plants. The spotted frog does not usually inhabit areas with large amounts of grasses and sagebrush growing. These plants are not as aquatic as the algae, which makes them a poor hiding place for the spotted frog. The Columbia spotted frog rarely ventures outside of these areas, but for breeding, they have been known to travel outside of these areas. Reproduction The Columbia spotted frog reproduces similarly to other amphibians, but with a few unique details added. They need to reproduce in areas where emergent vegetation is present. Two of the favorite types of vegetation for reproduction are reed canary grasses and cattails. The spotted frog reproduces in the same areas where it lives- ponds, slow-moving streams, and lakes. The males present to the females a chorus (type of song) to try to attract a female for mating. This song ranges from a series of clicks to long, glottal sounds. This frog has an unusual characteristic of its reproduction. The male frog arrives at the breeding grounds before the female and establishes the oviposition site before the females become reproductively active. Columbia spotted frog egg mass (free- floating in a pond) =Female= Once the oviposition site is created, the female then begins to lay her eggs in shallow water, and the male fertilizes the eggs. The egg masses, fairly large in size, range up to 1300 eggs. The egg masses, once laid, absorb water and become the size of a softball. These eggs are not attached to any type of vegetation, but are left free-floating in a permanent water source. Soon after, the eggs hatch into tadpoles. =Breeding times= The Columbia spotted frog's breeding schedule depends heavily on geographical location and elevation. In British Columbia, the frog will breed during February at sea level. In areas around Utah, the frog will breed around mid-March at an elevation of about . At areas of Wyoming, the frog will reproduce from May through June at elevations around . The female will breed yearly at lower elevations and about every two to three years at higher elevations. Diet This frog is opportunistic at best. It will eat a variety of insects, including grasshoppers, ants, wasps, beetles, and moths. These insects comprise more than 50% of the frog's diet. This frog will also eat seemingly unusual animals, such as crustaceans, mollusks, arthropods, and arachnids. In addition to being an insectivore, the Columbia spotted frog will eat algae, organic debris, a variety of plants, and other smaller, water- dwelling organisms.

He specialized in quantum theory and philosophy of science. As a physicist he concentrated on the interaction between relativity theory and quantum mechanics. He has authored many works and research on complementarity in quantum entanglement as well as multiparticle quantum interferometry, both relating to quantum coherence. He has authored research articles and books on the foundations of quantum mechanics. He received the 1996 Lakatos Prize for his work in Philosophy of Science. Education Shimony was born in Columbus, Ohio. He obtained his BA in Mathematics and Philosophy from Yale University in 1948, and an MA in Philosophy from the University of Chicago in 1950. He obtained his Ph.D. in philosophy from Yale University in 1953 under the supervision of Rudolf Carnap, and served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps from 1953 to 1955. Shimony acquired his second doctorate in physics from Princeton University in 1962 under the supervision of Eugene Wigner with a thesis titled Regression and Response in Thermodynamic Systems. Career After receiving his second Ph.D., Shimony interacted with both the philosophical academic world and the physics academic world. His most famous professional correspondence is with Rudolf Carnap. He taught philosophy of science at MIT from 1959 until 1968 in the school‚Äôs Department of Humanities. In 1968 he transferred to Boston University, beginning a 26-year appointment in both the physics and philosophy departments, and was Professor Emeritus there until his death in 2015. Shimony is best known for his work in developing the CHSH inequality, an empirically testable form of the Bell inequality, also known as Bell's theorem. Since 1992, he proposed a geometric measure of quantum entanglement and, along with Gregg Jaeger and Michael Horne, discovered two novel complementarity relations involving interferometric visibility in multiparticle quantum interferometry. He is also known for his inquiry into the question of the \\"peaceful coexistence\\" of quantum mechanics and special relativity. He wrote several books and numerous research articles on the foundations of quantum mechanics and related topics. Shimony is credited with the phrase \\"passion at a distance\\" to characterize the various phenomena described by quantum correlations. In 1996 he was awarded the Lakatos Award in the philosophy of science for the two-volume collection of papers, The Search for a Naturalistic World View, spanning his career up until 1992. He served as president of the Philosophy of Science Association from 1995 to 1996. He died in New Haven, Connecticut, aged 87. Shimony was married to the noted anthropologist Annemarie Anrod Shimony., from 1951 until her death in 1995. Selected publications ;Primary ** 1987.

The 62-storey Shangri-La tower contains a 5-star hotel and its offices on the first 15 floors, with condominium apartment units occupying the rest of the tower. The building's podium complex also includes a spa, Urban Fare specialty grocery store, a Vancouver Art Gallery public display, and a curated public sculpture garden. The high-rise stands tall and there is a private roof garden on floor 61. It is the 7th tallest building in Canada. As part of the development deal, the Coastal Church, built in 1919 and located at the west end of the site, underwent a $4.4million restoration. Hotel The Shangri-La Hotel Vancouver is a full-service hotel that is part of the building. It is a member of the Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts chain, and is Shangri-La's first North American property. The hotel occupies floors Ground to 15 with 119 rooms (including a presidential suite on the 15th floor). There is no 4th or 13th floor. The hotel includes 5-star services such as restaurants, shops, and Chi The Spa at Shangri-La.  Residences  Living Shangri-La also contains 307 residential units, consisting of 234 general live-work homes on floors 16 to 43 and 63 private access residential units on floors 44‚Äì60 with three penthouses on floor 61. The condominium units are accessible from the entrance at 1128 West Georgia Street and 1111 Alberni Street. Construction The project required 3.1million man-hours of employment, 15,000 truckloads of earth excavated, of concrete, and of reinforcing steel. During the height of construction activity, 1,000 workers were on site constructing one floor per week. The Shangri-La set Vancouver's record for the deepest excavation of , defeating the past record of set by the One Wall Centre, and it officially became the tallest building in Vancouver on October 2, 2007. The total cost of this building was near . The tower crane on top of the building was fitted with Christmas lights on November 13, 2007, and was the tallest crane illuminated in Vancouver in 2007. A windstorm on January 15, 2008, caused loose construction materials to blow off the building and into the streets below. Parked vehicles were damaged by falling plywood, but there were no injuries. The neighbouring Terasen Gas building also sustained damage in the storm. Police closed off West Georgia Street for over twelve hours. The development was marketed by Bob Rennie of Rennie Marketing Systems.  Cultural references  The building was featured in the 2010 film Tron: Legacy as the headquarters of the fictional company ENCOM International.

CGL is analogous to GLX, which is the X11 interface to OpenGL, as well as WGL, which is the Microsoft Windows interface to OpenGL. History All windowing system interfaces to OpenGL arose out of the migration of Silicon Graphics proprietary 3D graphics application programming interface (API) IrisGL to its current open standard form OpenGL. When the decision was made to make IrisGL an open standard, the primary required design change was to make this graphics standard API windowing system agnostic. All window system specific logic was therefore removed from IrisGL when moving to OpenGL. Window system logic includes any event mechanism for gathering input from devices such as keyboards and mice, as well as any window ordering or sizing logic used when drawing to a modern windowed user interface. Further, all internal management of window memory buffers, sometimes referred to as surfaces, was also removed from IrisGL to create OpenGL. With OpenGL windowing system agnostic, companies such as Apple must shoulder the burden of configuring and managing the surfaces used as a destination for OpenGL rendering. Features =Windowing system interfaces= On OS X, CGL is the foundation layer of windowing system interfaces to OpenGL. Both AGL (Apple Graphics Library) and the Cocoa (API) (or AppKit) have interfaces to OpenGL and are logical software layers and depend on CGL for their behavior. CGL and AGL interoperate freely. CGL and Cocoa may be used together, however Cocoa classes may implicitly make changes to CGL state. Function calls from AGL and Cocoa should not be mixed. Configuration of these surfaces is done through a pixel format selection process where different compatible layers of rendering information are combined to form a framebuffer. Examples of such layers are color buffers, transparency buffers (alpha), stencil buffers, and depth buffers. The CGL function CGLChoosePixelFormat is used to perform this buffer compatibility check. CGLChoosePixelFormat will, based on input parameters and their scoring policy, choose a pixel format that represents a compatible buffer configuration that is supported by the underlying renderer that will be used to process graphics commands. Renderers may be either hardware based, such that they correspond to graphics cards installed in the system or they may be software based, where the main CPU of the system handles all of the graphics command processing and final rasterization work. =Handling Mac OS X heterogeneity= On Mac OS X, CGL is also responsible for handling the heterogeneous nature of graphics device installations and configuration on Macintosh systems. Macintosh computers may have any number of displays and graphics cards installed in them. In these configurations, the user's desktop may be virtualized (extended) or mirrored across multiple displays which are connected to multiple graphics cards which may or may not be from the same graphics vendor. =Controlling the rendering= When users configure their Macintosh to use a virtualized desktop, and they drag windows from one display to another, CGL handles the management of OpenGL graphics state that must be shadowed between devices to provide command processing consistency between them. Dragging a window across a Macintosh desktop between two different displays that are supported by two different renderers is known as a \\"Virtual Screen Change\\". CGL also provides a mechanism to obtain information about the renderer that is currently in use. The primary data structure that maintains OpenGL state on Mac OS X is a CGLContextObj. These CGL contexts can be retrieved at any time using a call to CGLGetCurrentContext. The CGLContextObj may then be queried for specifics about the renderer that is associated with it. =Software renderer= Also included is Apple's in-house OpenGL software renderer. Originally, this was a simple integer package, in 10.3 a new floating point one was introduced which ultimately replaced it. The software renderer, though slow, is fast enough for basic applications and kept feature- complete with OS X's OpenGL implementation for development purposes.

It is sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet and offers bachelor's degrees and master's degrees. Its 13 buildings are situated on a campus of in Kansas City. The school enrolled 1,527 students in 2019. History In 1916, on the same campus at 5600 Main Street as St. Teresa's Academy, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet founded the College of Saint Teresa. St. Teresa's College was founded as a two-year college for women only. The first graduates of St. Teresa's College received their degrees in 1918. In 1939, Kansas City Bishop Edwin O‚ÄôHara announced that St. Teresa's junior college would be expanded to a full four-year college, and the college would be housed in its own building on the campus. In 1940, ground was broken for Donnelly Hall, and it opened for classes in 1941. The first four-year graduating class received their degrees in 1942. In 1948, the college established a department of nursing, offering both a three-year diploma and a four-year bachelor of nursing degree. In May 1961, Sister Mary Daniel Tammany, president of the College of St. Teresa, announced the purchase of 49 acres of land for a new campus at 119th and Wornall Road in the Red Bridge neighborhood near the southern edge of Kansas City, Missouri. The high school, St. Teresa's Academy, is still operating on the original site. At the groundbreaking for the first building on the new campus, the announcement was made that the college would be renamed Avila College, still in honor of Saint Teresa of Avila. In 1969 Avila began admitting male students, and in 1978, the college began offering graduate programs in business, education and psychology. Avila College became Avila University in July, 2002. Student body Of the 1,710 students attending Avila University in the fall of 2016, females outnumber males 62 percent to 38 percent. 57 percent of students are Caucasian, 20 percent are African-American, 10 percent International and eight percent Hispanic. 20 percent are Catholic. The average ACT score of the incoming freshman class is 23. About 31% of students live on campus. Academics Avila University is divided into three colleges. Each College has a collection of Schools for the various programs: * College of Liberal Arts & Social Sciences # School of Humanities # School of Performing Arts # School of Psychology # School of Social Sciences * College of Science & Health # School of Natural and Applied Sciences # School of Computer Sciences & Mathematics # School of Imaging Sciences # School of Nursing * College of Professional Schools # School of Business # School of Education # School of Visual and Communication Arts # Avila Institute for Professional Studies Campus Opened in 2007, Thompson Hall is the second-newest residence hall on campus. The south side of the residence hall overlooks the athletics field. Avila's campus sits on in southern Kansas City, Missouri. There are 13 buildings that include four residence halls, a fieldhouse, theatre, student union, library, as well as academic buildings. The campus is easily accessed from I-435 and sits close to the Missouri-Kansas border. =Student life= Student life at Avila is quite active with more than 40 student organizations available to the student body, including the Student Senate, Group Activities Programming, Black Student Union, Student Social Work Association, Residence Hall Association, Campus Ministries, and numerous academic organizations and honor societies. Avila University currently does not have any fraternities or sororities on campus. In the mid-1990s, Avila had a chapter of Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity and a chapter of Alpha Phi sorority; however, as a result of poor support from the university administration, both Greek chapters closed shortly before the college achieved university status.\\"Greek Life Disappears\\". Talon News Magazine. May 2006. p 4 =Residential life= Carondelet Hall was the first residence hall built at the current Avila University location. Carondelet houses up to 122 students at its maximum capacity. In the summer of 2005, the first two floors of the hall were renovated to fit the more modern version of a residence hall. In the summer of 2007, the third floor was also renovated. Ridgway Hall was built only a few years after Carondelet Hall, and has the same floor plan and room dimensions. In the summer of 2008, all three floors in Ridgway were renovated in a similar manner as Carondelet. Jeanne Collins Thompson Hall opened Fall of 2007. The 29,000 square foot Thompson Hall features three floors of suite-style housing with each suite containing four bedrooms, two bathrooms, living room, and kitchenette. The facility houses 65 students and staff in the 16 suites. In fall 2012, Avila celebrated the opening of its fourth residence hall, Avila Hall (later dedicated as Glenna Wylie Hall), a 39,000 square foot three-story residence hall on the northeast edge of campus. The residence hall features suite style living arrangements, and it increased Avila's capacity to allow up to 390 students living on campus.Fourth Residence Hall completed - pmaengg.com Athletics Avila athletic programs participate in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Avila fields 12 varsity sports including Football, Baseball, Softball, Men's and Women's Soccer, Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and Women's Cross Country, and Women's Volleyball. Avila also has award-winning Cheer and Dance Teams. The scoreboard on the south side of the athletic field, installed in 2011 Avila athletic teams were originally known as the Avalanche, but teams became known as the Eagles beginning in 1990. In 1994, Avila became a charter member of the Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference. In 1999 Avila announced the addition of intercollegiate football to the athletic program, and Tim Johnson was hired as the program's first head coach. Avila joined the Heart of America Athletic Conference in 2000, and football began its first season of competition in Fall 2001. In 2011, the athletic complex was expanded to provide facilities for football and soccer games to be played on campus. A 194,000 square foot multi-purpose athletic field was constructed, featuring a Shaw Sportexe Legion synthetic turf system.Shaw Sportexe Legion Turf added The field included a new press box, new bleachers, and a Daktronics scoreboard.

He made his first-class debut in 1907, made 1,000 runs at a respectable average in both 1908 and 1909, but only really came to the fore in 1910 when, with 1,585 runs at an average of nearly 37 runs per innings, he was selected for the Gentlemen v Players matches at The Oval and Lord's. He did little in the first match, but in the second, though scoring only 24 and 35, he impressed the editor of Wisden sufficiently to be named in the 1911 edition as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His big innings of the season was 234 for Lancashire against the very weak Somerset team at Old Trafford, and he also scored a century in the return fixture at Bath. In 1911, Hartley's performance fell away significantly: he failed to reach 1,000 runs and scored no centuries. He played only a handful of matches in 1912, none the following year and just one in 1914.

It feeds near shore and is free swimming. It typically weighs 6 to 30 pounds (3 to 23 kg). It is much smaller than the larger and more northern-ranging Pacific halibut that can reach 300 pounds (140 kg). This is an unusual fish in that one eye has to migrate around from one side to the other as it grows from an upright fry or baby fish into an adult fish that lies on its side. The adult has two eyes on the up-side as it lies on the bottom. Most flatfish are generally either right-eyed or left-eyed, but the California halibut is unusual in having a roughly even number of each type. Like other flatfish, the halibut hides under sand or loose gravel and blends into the bottom.

Riley moved to Chicago in 1982 from Detroit, where he had worked as a recording engineer. He played on Big Black's two studio albums, Atomizer (1986) and Songs About Fucking (1987), as well as their Headache EP (1987), several singles, and two live albums. After Big Black, Riley recorded tracks with several other artists before being incapacitated by a stroke in 1993, losing the ability to walk. He became a blogger, and published a book in 2006 titled Blurry and Disconnected: Tales of Sink-or-Swim Nihilism. He died in late 2019 from squamous cell carcinoma. Early life Growing up, Riley was a misfit and often bullied, the target of what he later called \\"insidious crap perpetrated by imperceptive emotional retards.\\" As a teenager he was in a car accident that permanently disfigured his face, causing a speech disorder. Career In Detroit, Riley worked as a recording engineer at a studio where funk artists George Clinton and Sly Stone recorded.Azerrad, p. 329. His engineering credits include Parliament's Trombipulation (1980) and Funkadelic's The Electric Spanking of War Babies (1981). He moved to Chicago in 1982 and became bassist in the punk band Savage Beliefs, who released one EP, The Moral Efficiency of Savage Beliefs (1983). He met Big Black guitarist Santiago Durango at a punk show at the Cubby Bear, where Durango, drunk and vomiting in the club's restroom, complimented his playing style. Big Black was getting ready to release their Racer-X EP (1985), but bassist Jeff Pezzati was amicably departing the band to focus on his job, fianc√©e, and primary band Naked Raygun. Big Black's leader, singer/guitarist Steve Albini, was also impressed by Riley's playing in Savage Beliefs and gave him a copy of Big Black's first EP, Lungs (1982), telling him \\"Listen to this, and if you don't think it sucks, then maybe you can play with us someday.\\" Riley joined Big Black the week of Racer-X's release in April 1985, while also keeping his day job as a litigation law clerk.Azerrad, pp. 328‚Äì330. He learned the group's repertoire, and they began writing songs for the band's first LP. That May, Riley produced and played saxophone on Ward, an EP by Chicago experimental band End Result which came out on Albini's Ruthless Records label.Azerrad, pp. 334‚Äì335. Big Black's Atomizer came out in 1986; in Our Band Could Be Your Life (2001), author Michael Azerrad remarks that \\"Riley's gnarled bass sound combined explosively with the brutally insistent hammering of the drum machine while his funk background gave the music an almost danceable kick\\". The album was polarizing due to its aggressive, violent music and lyrics, but won praised in the national press and became an underground success, selling 3,000 copies upon its release on Homestead Records.Azerrad, pp. 330‚Äì332. This led to a tour of Europe that year, on which the band met an enthusiastic response.Azerrad, p. 334. \\"It was kind of overwhelming for a while,\\" Riley told Azerrad; \\"Needless to say, I got used to it really damn quick. People actually appreciated what you were doing and it was kind of cool. It was much different from America. We were treated with respect in Europe.\\" After a falling out with Homestead and its distributor, Dutch East India Trading, Big Black signed to Touch and Go Records and released the Headache EP in spring 1987.Azerrad, pp. 334‚Äì337. Tensions were mounting within the band, with Riley earning Albini's ire.Azerrad, p. 338. Albini did not drink alcohol, so Riley and Durango became drinking buddies on the road while Albini was doing interviews and handling the band's logistics. Albini later claimed that Riley was \\"kind of fucked up most of the time\\" (which Riley denied) and accused him of a number of other shortcomings including \\"always [being] late for rehearsal, never having equipment together, needing a ride to everything, a fresh excuse for every day, generally unkempt and unreliable, impossible to communicate with when loaded, flashes of brilliance offset by flashes of belligerence.\\" Durango claimed that Riley's drunkenness ruined several of the band's shows, including one in Milwaukee where \\"he couldn't even sit on the stage. We tried to plug him in and he fought us off. He was fucked up beyond fucked up ‚Äî he was FUBAR.\\" Durango also related that at a key show at New York's CBGB, Riley drunkenly smashed the drum machine and the band had to call in Peter Prescott of opening act Volcano Suns to play live drums, but Prescott did not know the songs and the show was ruined (in a 2008 interview, when asked whether Riley had smashed the drum machine during a concert, Albini said \\"I don't remember anything like that ever happening\\"). Albini made a number of threats, but never fired Riley; Durango later remarked that \\"It was kind of a love-hate thing\\" and speculated that \\"maybe on some subconscious level he understood that that was something Dave brought to the band.\\" By late 1986 Riley was in college and both Albini and Durango had to keep day jobs, limiting the band's touring opportunities. When Durango chose to enter law school, the band decided to keep going until his schooling began in the fall of 1987 and then disband.Azerrad, p. 339. They were now enjoying increased press, radio airplay, record sales, and concert fees, but Riley later said \\"Big Black was never about that. For Big Black to make any money, it wouldn't have been Big Black anymore.\\"Azerrad, p. 340. A final tour, from June to August 1987, took the band to Europe (including performing at the Pukkelpop festival in Belgium), the United Kingdom, Australia, and across the United States, ending with their final show at Seattle's Georgetown Steam Plant where they smashed their instruments onstage.Azerrad, p. 341. Big Black's second studio album, Songs About Fucking, was released shortly after their breakup and became their best-selling record, with an initial pressing of 8,000 copies. Riley worked with other bands in subsequent years: He produced Chicago hardcore punk band Rights of the Accused's 1987 album Dillinger's Alley with Iain Burgess; sang gang vocals on the song \\"Red\\" on Flour's self-titled 1988 album; produced Spongetunnel's 1989 EP (1989); played bass, piano, and additional percussion on two tracks on Algebra Suicide's 1990 album Alpha Cue; and played bass on Bull's \\"Tinbox\\" single (1992). Disability and writing Riley suffered a stroke in 1993 which caused paraplegia; he was unable to walk, and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The doctors attending to him erroneously thought that his condition was the result of drug use or a suicide attempt, and he was forced to live in a \\"convalescent home\\" for nearly 10 years, with people he described as \\"lowlifes, criminals, psychopaths, and token seniors with whom nobody wanted to bother.\\" He participated in a musical project called Miasma of Funk, engineering and doing drum programming for a track titled \\"The Law of Averages\\" on the 1997 compilation album The Glory of Destruction. He was able to get out of the government care system in 2001, and moved into an apartment south of Chicago. He later moved to a farm in west-central Illinois with longtime friend Rachel Brown, who he had met in the late 1980s. Miasma of Funk released a studio album, Groove on the Mania!, in 2004. In 2006 Riley published Blurry and Disconnected: Tales of Sink-or-Swim, a book consisting of five satirical short stories and a novella. He also started a blog that year titled \\"Worthless Goddamn Cripple\\", on which he wrote about his experiences until 2008. Big Black reunited for a short performance on September 9, 2006 at Touch and Go Records' 25th Anniversary festival. Albini did not invite Riley to participate, later saying that \\"We haven't kept close contact post-Big Black, but it's been close enough to know that he wasn't in a condition to play. I didn't want to put him in an awkward position of trying to play, but not being able to do it.\\" Instead, they called upon original bassist Jeff Pezzati and played four songs from his tenure with the band. Later years and death In 2015 Riley and Brown retired to a small ranch near Arivaca, Arizona. In late August 2019 he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma that had begun in his throat and spread to his lungs, and died on December 24, 2019. Commenting on Riley's death to Rolling Stone, Albini called him \\"a fantastic musician and a critical part of the Chicago music scene. He bridged the gap between raw enthusiasm and outstanding musicianship better than anybody else in our peer group and I always admired him for it\\", while Durango remarked \\"Many of my favorite Big Black memories involve Dave, including the riot he single-handedly started by taunting the audience at one of our shows in Australia. A wicked prankster. Funny, charming, smart and talented. I would glue myself to Dave on our tours. Dave was a positive force in my life and I will miss him dearly.\\" Discography *Parliament ‚Äì Trombipulation (studio album, 1980): recording engineer *Funkadelic ‚Äì The Electric Spanking of War Babies (studio album, 1981): recording engineer *Savage Beliefs ‚Äì The Moral Efficiency of Savage Beliefs (EP, 1983): bass guitar *Savage Beliefs ‚Äì The Middle of America Compilation (various artists compilation, 1984): bass guitar on \\"Shake Your Neighbor's Hand\\", drums and vocals on \\"Double Standard\\" *Big Black ‚Äì \\"Rema-Rema\\" (single, 1985): bass guitar *Big Black ‚Äì \\"Il Duce\\" (single, 1985): bass guitar *End Result ‚Äì Ward (EP, 1985): producer, saxophone *Big Black ‚Äì Atomizer (studio album, 1986): bass guitar *Big Black ‚Äì God's Favorite Dog (various artists compilation, 1986): bass guitar on \\"Every Man for Himself\\" and \\"Crack Up\\" *Big Black ‚Äì Sound of Impact (live album, 1987): bass guitar *Big Black ‚Äì Happiness Is Dry Pants (various artists compilation, 1987): bass guitar on \\"Burning Indian Wife\\" *Big Black ‚Äì Headache (EP, 1987): bass guitar *Big Black ‚Äì \\"Heartbeat\\" (single, 1987): bass guitar *Big Black ‚Äì \\"He's a Whore\\" / \\"The Model\\" (single, 1987): bass guitar *Big Black ‚Äì Songs About Fucking (studio album, 1987): bass guitar *Rights of the Accused ‚Äì Dillinger's Alley (studio album, 1987): producer *Big Black ‚Äì The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape (compilation album, 1987): bass guitar *Flour ‚Äì Flour (studio album, 1988): gang vocals on \\"Red\\" *Spongetunnel ‚Äì 1989 (EP, 1989): producer *Algebra Suicide ‚Äì Alpha Cue (studio album, 1990): bass guitar, piano, and additional percussion on \\"Summer Virus Night\\" and \\"What Rubs Up to You\\" *Big Black ‚Äì Pigpile (video album/live album, 1992): bass guitar *Big Black ‚Äì \\"In My House\\" (single, 1992): bass guitar *Bull ‚Äì \\"Tinbox\\" (single, 1992): bass guitar *Miasma of Funk ‚Äì The Glory of Destruction (various artists compilation, 1997): recording engineer and drum programming on \\"The Law of Averages\\" *Miasma of Funk ‚Äì Groove on the Mania!

Broadcasting at 1040 kHz on the AM dial, the station is owned by Robert C. Savage under the name Radio Livingston and serves Livingston County and the Rochester metropolitan area. WYSL streams most of its programming on the Internet. History The call letters for WYSL were taken from a radio station in Buffalo which had used the same calls (that station is now known as WWWS). Savage launched an all-news format in 1987 on 1030 kHz as a daytime-only station, but would later move to the 1040 frequency to broadcast 24 hours per day. Historically the station was an all-news radio format with both local content and programming from the Associated Press. The all-news format, however, would end in 2006 for a number of reasons. First, the Associated Press discontinued its radio services in July 2005. WYSL replaced the network with CNN Headline News, the only other national commercial all-news outlet available. After that, however, CNNHN decided to launch \\"Headline Prime,\\" which effectively eliminated its viability as an all-news network between the hours of 7 PM and 2 AM ET (later expanded through the entire overnight). This left a large hole in the schedule. Third, the Rochester market's \\"second-tier\\" news talker, WROC 950, had been replaced by a progressive talk format and had locked up the area's CBS Radio Network affiliation. As a result, WYSL picked up conservative talkers Laura Ingraham and Bill O'Reilly from the former WROC lineup and added Rusty Humphries and Jerry Doyle from Talk Radio Network to fill in the late evening gap, thereby transforming the station into a news-talker. WYSL shares some news staff with another small station, WSPQ in Springville, which the station refers to as its \\"Western New York bureau.\\" WYSL was affiliated with ABC News Radio and the Wall Street Journal Radio Network, but switched to the Salem Radio Network for newscasts in 2012, following what Savage described as an unacceptably pro-Democratic bias in ABC's reporting of the 2012 Republican presidential primaries. WYSL increased its daytime power from 2,500 watts to 20,000 watts in November 2006. It operates at reduced power at night to protect clear-channel station WHO in Des Moines, Iowa. =Programming changes in 2007= WYSL continued to transition into a full-time talk radio station in 2007. Early in 2007, the station added its first local talk show, hosted by local attorney Bill Nojay, as well as picking up Dennis Miller in the afternoon drive time slot. The CNN Headline News affiliation was completely dropped by June 2007 and replaced by Jim Bohannon while Jim Quinn's syndicated The War Room with Quinn and Rose was picked up in the morning drive, thus eliminating the last \\"all news\\" programming block on the station, in October 2007. Nojay's show began syndication in 2008 on WLEA in Hornell as well as on WGVA and its numerous simulcasts in the Finger Lakes. WYSL is affiliated with WHEC-TV (\\"10NBC\\") to simulcast that station's local newscasts. Savage is in the process of applying for a sister station for WYSL, which will operate at 1220 kHz and be licensed to Lakeville, New York. The new station will operate from the same tower site as WYSL. An FM translator, W221CL, went on the air in early 2010 which covers the city of Rochester and portions of Monroe County. The FM station is branded \\"FM TALK 92.1 WYSL\\", which simulcasts WYSL 1040 AM. Conflict with HD Radio Savage has been a vocal opponent of the new HD Radio technology being used on the AM band, saying that the technology causes undue interference and unnecessary broadcast delay for minimal gain in quality.WYSL 1040 AM He has since filed a formal complaint with the Federal Communications Commission over interference caused by WBZ's nighttime HD signal on the adjacent 1030 kHz frequency,NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush from which Savage had moved many years earlier to avoid that interference when his station went to a 24-hour broadcast schedule.

The station sells its evening and weekend airtime for brokered programming. In addition to brokered shows, WYSL replays weekday hosts as noted above, and carries some local high school, college and minor league sports. =Former Programs= Attorney Bill Nojay hosted a daily hour-long program on WYSL for several years, prior to his election to the New York State Assembly as well as during his tenure in the legislature; Nojay's show was syndicated across two other radio stations in upstate New York. Nojay was still hosting the show when he committed apparent suicide in 2016. Nojay's time slot was filled by Shannon Joy until WYSL abruptly canceled the program in November 2018; Joy landed at WHAM shortly thereafter.

The city itself has a population of about 15,000. The population of the municipality in 2011 was 23,850,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 658.96 km¬≤. Mirandela is famous for its cuisine, particularly the alheiras. A round of the European Jetski Championship is held on the Tua River every Summer. The city has two campuses of higher education institutions - one belonging to the public Bragan√ßa Polytechnic Institute and one belonging to the private Instituto Piaget. History The settlements of Mirandela date back to the pre-historical period, but primarily relate to a period of Roman occupation. During this era, the main settlement of Mirandela was a Roman civitas, known then as Caladunum. There are abundant vestiges of the Roman occupation in Castelo Velho, S√£o Martinho, Mourel and Prado Pequeno, that include copper coins from the reign of Emperor Tiberius. At this time the civitas was located in the region of S√£o Martinho, but there are conflicting references as to the location of the main settlement, and when it was moved. Ernesto de Sales, referenced three documents that localized the Christian village near S√£o Martinho (even as another document in 1258 disputed the existence of the village of Mirandela in or near this region): * a charter, written by King Sancho I to Garcia Mendes, in 1198, to a location in Vilar de Ma√ßada; * a charter, written by King Afonso III conceded on 25 May 1250 to Mirandela; and * a receipt made by notary in Mirandela, on 27 March 1275. It is clear, from the documents of King Denis, at the time when he was elaborating the defenses of the city of Guarda (2 September 1282), the transfer of the town of Mirandela to hilltop of mount S√£o Miguel (where a small hermitage chapel existed at the time) had likely already occurred. This location was easily defendable and dominated the view of the fertile lands and river access. King Afonso III granted a foral (charter) on 25 May 1250. The magistrate of Mirandela at the time governed a region that included Torre de D. Chama, Frechas, Sesulfe, Nozelos, Vilas Boas, Vale de Asnes and Corti√ßos. This document was expanded and elaborated by King Denis of Portugal, when he issued an updated foral on 7 March 1291, that also stipulated that every villager, who was able to do so, contribute a horse and arms and annual stipend on S√£o Miguel day, in September. King Denis also ordered the construction of protective walls around the main settlement and keep to support military needs. By the beginning of the 16th century, there were no remnants of a castle or walls. The castle was then describe as having three gates (Santo Ant√≥nio, Santiago and Portela) and small doorway (S√£o Jos√©), in addition to a traitors-gate near Quebra-Costas. It also included battlements and interior keep, near the prison block, that served as the royal residence, on his return. The T√°vora family was donated Mirandela around 1301, when King Denis signed over its title to Branca Louren√ßo, remaining in this hereditary clan until Francisco de Assis de T√°vora (1721-1759). The new foral later outlined the geographic divisions of the municipality. Between 1530 and 1835, the municipality of Mirandela included the following 44 places and 9 estates: Abambres, Ala, Alvites, Avantes, Brin√ßo, Cabanelas, Caravelas, Carvalhais, Ced√£es, Cedainhos, Chelas, Contins, Freixeda, Mascarenhas, Miradeses, Mirandela, Pousadas, Quintas, S√£o Salvados, Val de Lobo, Val de Salgueiro, Valtelhas, Vila Nova, Vila Verde and Vilar de Ledra. Similarly, between 1512 and 1871, the region underwent a series of territorial divisions that included the creation (and eventual suppression) of the municipalities of Torre de Chama, Frechas, Vale de Asnes, Abreiro, Lamas de Orelh√£o. Torre de Chama would be the most discontinuous: it was created 1287 by King Denis, but suppressed on 12 September, later to be resuscitated on 4 May 1512 by King Manuel, and then extinguished in 1855. A royal decree on 18 July 1835, preceded another territorial division that caused the elimination of various parishes and municipalities: Mirandela was left with 40 parishes (that included Cedainhos and Vale da Sancha). By 1884, the municipality of Mirandela had the established geographic boundaries. The town of Mirandela was elevated to the status of city on 28 June 1984. Railway Until 2009, Mirandela was served by the Tua line - a narrow gauge railway which ran from Bragan√ßa to Tua. The section north of Mirandela to Bragan√ßa closed in the early 1990s; the line to Tua closed in 2009. However, until 2018 a short section of the line north of Mirandela was still open to local passenger services as the Metro de Mirandela. Geography and Climate { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } The municipality is bordered by the municipalities of Mur√ßa, Valpa√ßos, Vinhais, Bragan√ßa, Macedo de Cavaleiros, Vila Flor and Carrazeda de Ansi√£es, and is located in the district of Bragan√ßa. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 30 civil parishes (freguesias): * Abambres * Abreiro * Aguieiras * Alvites * Avantos e Romeu * Avidagos, Navalho e Pereira * Barcel, Marmelos e Valverde da Gestosa * Bou√ßa * Cabanelas * Caravelas * Carvalhais * Ced√£es * Cobro * Fradizela * Franco e Vila Boa * Frechas * Freixeda e Vila Verde * Lamas de Orelh√£o * Mascarenhas * Mirandela * M√∫rias * Passos * S√£o Pedro Velho * S√£o Salvador * Su√ß√£es * Torre de Dona Chama * Vale de Asnes * Vale de Gouvinhas * Vale de Salgueiro * Vale de Telhas =Climate= Mirandela has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csa) with hot dry summers and cool wet winters.

Biography Benavent was born in the Poble Sec neighborhood in Barcelona. He started playing the bass when he was thirteen years old, attracted by blues and rock, Jimi Hendrix in particular. A totally self-taught jazz bassist, he founded the group, \\"M√∫sica Urbana\\" with which he recorded two albums. He came to create a new form of playing the electric bass \\"Flamenco style\\", using the pick to create a special type of alzap√∫a (style of plucking the strings with the finger and pick). His preferred instrument is the fretless bass, which was pretty uncommon at the time, so he can be considered one of the fretless bass pioneers in Flamenco music. One of the hallmark pieces that first showcased his unique playing was his duet with Paco de Lucia on Paco's album Solo Quiero Caminar, called \\"Monasterio De Sal\\" (Colombiana). On the same album, his use of harmonics and his groove playing on the track \\"Chanela\\" (Rumba) are reminiscent of the great jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius. He is one of the musicians that is sought out by a long list of artists such as Chick Corea, Miles Davis and Paco de Luc√≠a, and with the last he recorded \\"Paco de Luc√≠a interpreta a Manuel de Falla\\". Since then the interaction between the two musicians has been consistent and fruitful, having played together for 25 years. =Injury= In 1995 he suffered a severe accident which seriously injured his left arm, causing Benavent to rethink his future as a musician, but he recovered well. After appearing in the Jazz Festival of Getxo he started the recording of the album F√©nix. His career is marked by collaborations inside and outside the world of flamenco - with his playing style, intuition, rhythm and musicality, he continues to be in continuous high demand for live performances and recording sessions. Equipment Carles Benavent in August 2007 Carles Benavent plays a Jerzy Drozd custom \\"Barcelona\\" type 4-string and 5-string basses, with a high C string instead of standard low B. Instead of sounding lower as is usual among five-string bass players, Benavent uses it higher to do chords and have a piccolo bass, being towards guitar.

The Society operated three convenience stores in the Holme Valley villages of New Mill, Thongsbridge and Wooldale.

The Society was a member of the Co-operative Retail Trading Group and a corporate member of The Co-operative Group. It also had agreements with the Co-operative Group for stock distribution and promotions. New Mill Village Store shares a building with a library In 2006, the Society met with its small neighbouring societies, Shepley Co-operative Society and Highburton Co-operative Society with a view to merger. This would have reduced costs and increased turnover by adding two further stores to its portfolio and combining administrative operations. These talks did not result positively and in the spring of 2007, the Society approached Rochdale-based United Co-operatives on the possibilities of a merger. The boards of the two societies agreed to a merger, but in a Special General Meeting held on 11 May 2007, the proposal was defeated by the members of the Wooldale society on a near 2:1 ratio.

A talent show is an event in which participants perform the arts of singing, dancing, lip-syncing, acting, martial arts, playing an instrument, poetry, comedy or other activities to showcase skills. Many talent shows are performances rather than contests, but some are actual contests. In the instance of a contest, participants may be motivated to perform for a reward, trophy, or prize of some kind. For example, a high school might not have many students with any interest in performing in front of the student body for the sole purpose of performing alone and may offer different prizes as an incentive for these students to participate in the contest. Media Since the late 1980s, talent shows have become a notable genre of reality television, such as Doorway to Fame (1947), Hollywood Screen Test (1948), Opportunity Knocks (1949), Chance of a Lifetime (1952), New Faces (1963), Notun Kuri (1966), The Gong Show (1976), Star Search (1983), Soundmixshow (1985), Showtime at the Apollo (1987), Popstars (1999), Amici di Maria De Filippi (2001), Idols (2001), Star Academy (2001), Last Comic Standing (2003), Dancing with the Stars (2004), The X Factor (2004), So You Think You Can Dance (2005), Dancing on Ice (2006), Got Talent (2006), How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?

Non- competitive talent shows for troubled youths Talent shows can be seen as a way to help boost the self-esteem, confidence, and assurance of youth. Some communities and companies see talent shows as a way to help prevent juvenile delinquency among children, teens, and young adults. As a result, these communities create programs such as Girls Only! in San Diego to promote the growth of these otherwise trouble youth to better the community. Such programs are created with the hope to prevent youth from the possibilities of entering delinquency or lives of crime.

Their mission is \\"providing hope and resources for those without life's essentials.\\" It provides food, essentials, education supplies and disaster relief to those in need across the United States and in 10 countries around the world. Domestically, it operates five distribution centers located in Oklahoma, Indiana, California, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. In fiscal year 2017, Feed the Children distributed 79.8 million pounds of food and essentials to children and families in the U.S. Internationally, it provided nutritious food or other benefits to 1,080,000 children, and impacted more than 1,200 communities and schools in 10 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. It is accredited by GuideStar Exchange and the BBB Wise Giving Alliance. U.S. programs Feed the Children's domestic programs are focused on distribution of food and essential items to families and children. Corporate partners work with Feed the Children to donate cash, food, essentials and other gift-in-kind items. Feed the Children's wholly owned for- profit subsidiary, FTC Transportation, Inc., picks up in-kind contributions from corporate warehouses and brings them to the closest Feed the Children regional distribution center. The food and supplies are then delivered to pre- approved, independent partner agencies that, in turn, distribute the supplies through various other organizations located in communities across the U.S. In fiscal year 2017, Feed the Children served more 850,000 meals through their Summer Food & Education program with the help of public funds and private partners to children in more than 20 states across the U.S. Feed the Children also focuses on education. Through each of its distribution centers, they operate a Teacher Store, which offers free school supplies and books to educators in area Title I schools. Through its partnership with National Association of Educators for Homeless Children and Youth (NAEHCY), Feed the Children has distributed more than a million Homeless Education and Literacy Program (H.E.L.P.) backpacks filled with school supplies, food and personal care items to children who are at-risk or homeless who are enrolled in U.S. public schools. International programs Through their work, they hope that: 1) All children will be properly nourished and developed by age 5 and continue to understand the importance of nutrition throughout their life; 2) All children will have access to safe and clean water, proper sanitation, and adequate hygiene resources that promote healthy immune systems and enable them to develop through adolescence and into adulthood; 3) All children will be able to enroll, feel safe, and complete a high-quality education that promotes lifelong learning; and 4) Families will be self-reliant, financially stable, and able to support and strengthen their communities. Examples of international projects funded by Feed the Children include medical mission trips and the \\"Casa del Ni√±o\\" (House of the child) in Barrio Ingles, La Ceiba, Honduras. In 2009 FTC has greatly expanded its program in Malawi. Using in- kind donations from Nuskin, Inc, 50,000 orphans and pre-school children, mostly in rural areas, receive a fortified porridge, VitaMeal. Feed the Children has received an $8.5 million grant from the USAID as part of a 5-year, $20 million project for orphans and vulnerable children. This will improve food security and access to nutrition, education, clean water, sanitation and sustainable agricultural development for 40,000 households and over 70,000 children impacted by HIV/AIDS in Malawi. The Tiwalere OVC Project, in full operation in 2011, will make Malawi the largest international program. In 2015, Feed the Children was granted special consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2017, The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded Feed the Children the largest grant in its history ‚Äì more than $19.15 million ‚Äì to fund the Tiwalere II project. Following the success of Tiwalere I, a similar but smaller project that improved nutrition for orphans and vulnerable children in Malawi from 2010 to 2015, the Tiwalere II project will strive to achieve significant and sustainable improvements in the nutritional status of children under the age of five, pregnant and lactating women, mothers of children under the age of two and adolescent girls in ten districts within central and northern Malawi. Disaster relief When Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, Feed the Children self-reported sending over 650 semi tractor-trailers totaling more than 20,000 tons of donated food and relief supplies. Between the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and the South Asian tsunami in December 2004, Feed the Children self-reported sending more than 15,500 tons of food and relief supplies to the affected regions. Feed the Children responded to the flooding in Louisiana, Virginia and West Virginia, the devastation caused by Hurricane Matthew, as well as other disasters as it distributed $3.4 million worth of food and essentials to disaster-affected regions in the United States. Internationally, in fiscal year 2017, Feed the Children trained more than 32,000 individuals in disaster risk-reduction and provided supplies like food, water and tarps to 57,000 individuals. Finances According to Feed the Children's IRS Form 990 for fiscal year 2019, 91% of its budget went to program services (childcare, food, medical, disaster relief, education and community development), 4% went to fundraising and 5% went to management and supporting services. Forbes ranks Feed the Children as the 43rd largest charity in the United States in its annual America's Top Charities report. Charity Navigator gives Feed the Children 3/4 stars with an \\"Accountability and Transparency\\" rating of 97, and an \\"Overall\\" rating of 89.18. GuideStar, a Charity Navigator partner, awards Feed the Children its Platinum Seal of Transparency for \\"voluntarily and publicly sharing information about how they measure their progress and results.\\" Feed the Children is accredited by the BBB Wise Giving Alliance. The organization is a member of InterAction, an alliance of international NGOs and partners in the United States. However, Feed the Children's finances have not always been viewed positively. Based on the rating criteria of the American Institute of Philanthropy, Feed the Children receives an \\"F\\" rating for financial efficiency for spending only 21‚Äì23 percent of its cash budget on charitable programs. Feed the Children disputes this rating, since the American Institute of Philanthropy does not include \\"gifts in kind\\" in its ratings, while other established charity rating organizations do include these gifts in their ratings as have Feed the Children's own auditors. The most recent (issued April 2018) ranking from CharityWatch, formerly known as the American Institute of Philanthropy, now provides Feed the Children with a C+ rating. The most recent information on Charity Navigator shows Feed the Children is the subject of an official inquiry according to an article in the Oklahoman titled, \\"New turmoil at Feed the Children.\\" For this reason, Charity Navigator issued a Moderate Concern Advisory. Leadership dispute After a lengthy leadership dispute between founder Larry Jones and the board and top executives of the charity, Jones agreed to give up operational control in August 2009. On November 6, 2009, the board voted to fire Jones from his position as president. On January 28, 2011, Jones and Feed The Children announced a resolution of the legal dispute. Jones is no longer associated in any way with Feed the Children. On June 4, 2012, Kevin Hagan, formerly with Good360, became the president and CEO of Feed the Children. In 2013, Feed The Children disclosed that it paid $800,000 to Jones, after he was fired in 2009. The severance payment, made during fiscal year 2012, was disclosed in a 204-page return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. Feed the Children made the payment to settle a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by Jones. The charity paid an additional amount in legal fees to Jones' attorney, Mark Hammons. For most of 2016, former congressman J.C. Watts Jr. served as the organization's president and CEO. The board of directors announced his appointment on January 21, 2016. On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles. In the same publicity release, the organization's board of directors announced that Travis Arnold would be serving as executive director and interim CEO. In early 2017, Travis Arnold was announced as the organization's president and CEO. Through his tenure with Feed the Children (he started working at the organization in 2001), Arnold has served cumulatively three and a half years as interim president and CEO, ensuring organizational continuity and focus on its philanthropic mission through periods of change.

Design and description The design of the Duguay-Trouin class was based on an improved version of a 1915 design, but was reworked with more speed and a more powerful armament to match the British and the American light cruisers. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their crew consisted of 591 men when serving as flagships.Jordan & Moulin, p. 30 Service history Completed in 1927, Lamotte-Picquet was based at Brest until 1933, serving with the 3rd Light Division, of which she was flagship. In 1935, she was sent to the Far East, where at the outbreak of war in 1939, she patrolled around French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies. After the French surrender in Europe, tension developed along the border with Siam (now Thailand). These flared into hostilities between Siam and Vichy France in December 1940. In January 1941, Lamotte-Picquet became the flagship of a small squadron, the Groupe Occasionnel. It was formed on 9 December at Cam Ranh Bay, near Saigon, under the command of Capitaine de Vaisseau B√©renger. The squadron also consisted of the colonial sloops Dumont d'Urville and Amiral Charner, and the older sloops Tahure and Marne. The Groupe Occasionnel with Lamotte-Picquet at its head, met a Thai squadron of two torpedo boats and a coastal defence ship in the Battle of Koh Chang on 14 January 1941. The Thai squadron was defeated, with both torpedo boats sunk and the coastal defence ship run aground. The victory was for naught, however, as the Japanese forced a settlement in the Franco-Thai War in favour of the Thai. Apart from a visit to Osaka, Japan in September 1941, Lamotte-Picquet was thereafter restricted in her activities. From the next month, Lamotte-Picquet was used as a training hulk. She was sunk in ƒê·ªìng Nai River, on 12 January 1945, by U.S carrier based aircraft from Task Force 38 during the South China Sea raid. The remains of the hull were scrapped after the war.

History Built through the initiative of the templar knight Gualdim Pais The history of Mogadouro is evident in the number of castros that dot the landscape of region from the neolithic period. In particular are the castros of Oleiros in Bemposta, Vilarinho, S√£o Martinho do Peso, Figueirinha de Travanca, Bru√ß√≥ and the more recently excavated castro in Vilari√ßa, in the Serra da Castanheira. The Celts passed through this region, leaving behind its art and religion, the so-called Cultura aos Berr√µes. One of these Celtic tribes, the Zoelae, were responsible for settling many of the lands along the Douro, Sabor and Angueira Rivers. During the Roman period, the region is referred to in art, religion and socio-economic reports, indicating its regional importance. The Ara Romana to Deus Jupiter Depulsori (which still survives to this day in Saldanha), is one of these remnants of this period (it was constructed during the reign of Septimius Severus in the 3rd century BC). Throughout the municipality area have been discovered many funerary stones and artefacts that attest the Romanization of these lands. Vestiges of the Visigothic era are rare, but include a paleo-Christian inscription that was discovered in S√£o Martinho do Peso (now in the Abade de Ba√ßal Museum in Bragan√ßa. Moorish influence in this region is limited to local handicrafts made from flax and wool, that includes the hand embroidery, quilts, rugs and towels. During the Reconquista era, it is known that Alfonso III of Le√≥n effected many construction projects during his reign, that were more strategic then political: organizing a military line along the Douro with castles (to protect the holdings of the Le√≥n while inducing incursions into Moorish lands, populating conquered territory and taking advantage of natural geography to defend his territory. After fortifying Zamora, around 893, he ordered the construction of castles along the line, repopulating them as he progressed. Toro and Simancas developed consequently from this policy. It is likely that the area of Mogadouro was settled as a strategic point along the line, resulting in the construction of the first fort. The regions name evolved from this settlement: M√≥go means a implanted marker, considered a symbolic delineation of the separation or division of a territory, a term imported from common language at the time. The m√≥go do Douro (mark on the Douro), or Mogadouro, developed from this locational designation. The Castle of Penas R√≥ias was constructed during the nation-building of Afonso Henriques. The stone of the cell-block tower is inscribed with a medieval statement: \\"Come√ßaram os fundamentos do Castelo chamadao Pena Roia na era de 1204 sendo Mestre Geral dos Templ√°rios Gualdim Pais\\" [They began the fundamentals of the Castle Pena Roia in the era of 1204 by Master General of the Templar Gualdim Pais]. The later Castle of Modagouro, from the same decade, was started prior to the establishment of the civic charter (foral) in 1272/73. During the Portuguese dynastic crisis (or Interregnum) the noble classes supported the King of Castile, resulting in an eventual reprisal by Prince John (who elevated the hamlet of Azinhoso and parsed it from Mogadouro). Consequently, although its economic activity did not contract, the lack of royal patronage meant that Mogadouro remained stagnated until the 16th century. Mogadouro, historically, fell within the Caminhos de Santiago, a capillary of secondary roadways that extended throughout the Tr√°s-os-Montes region leading pilgrims down Saint James Way. The principal road arrived in Mogadouro from Castelo Rodrigo, from two routes: from Freixo de Espada √† Cinta (Castelo Rodrigo, Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, Escalh√£o, crossing the Douro by boat in Barca de Alva, Quinta de Santiago, Freixo de Espada √† Cinta, M√≥s, Fornos, Lagoa√ßa, Bru√ß√≥, Mogadouro); the other from Moncorvo (Castelo Rodrigo, Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, Almendra, Castelo Melhor, Vila Nova de Foz C√¥a, crossing the Douro by boat in Pocinho, Moncorvo, Vilari√ßa, Adeganha, Parada, here crossing the Sabor in Santo Ant√£o da Barca before reaching Mogadouro). The Caminho de Santiago forked in Mogadouro at the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Caminho (Caminho de Santigao): to Azinhoso (an enormous enclosure existed near the Church of Azinhoso to provide shelter during the crossing), then over a medieval bridge that connected Penas Roias, Algoso, Vimioso to Bragan√ßa; the other road departed from the Church of Nossa Senhora do Caminho, to Santiago, then Algosinho (to another pilgrimage church), Ventoselo (where there still remains vestiges of the pilgrimages, such as the roof painting in the Chapel of Nossa Senhor da Boa Morte), on the way passing by a spring (where pilgrimages would satisfy their thirst), to another chapel to Santigao (now completely destroyed), Urr√≥s, Sendim, and Miranda do Douro). There were several tributaries, shortcuts and dirt tracks on the pilgrim roadways, such as: through Azinhoso (where the faithful would rest in the chapel to S√£o Gon√ßalo, a patron saint of the travellers); through Variz, Castanheira, Valcerto, Algoso, Campo de V√≠boras and Vimioso; through Santiago (now Vila de Ala), an important crossroads between Peredo de Bemposta (through Algosinho, Ventoselo and Vila de Ala) and Bemposta (through Lamoso, T√≥ and Vila de Ala). Those who travelled from the southern part of the district would likely stop in Zava (where a chapel to S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, the saint protector, was located). It was after the 16th century that Mogadouro saw some growth. The T√°vora family, a noble house with influence and power in court, controlled the region, commanding the fort and guiding the town, generally contributing to the development of the lands within their domain. It was through the action of the T√°voras that the local Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia was founded in 1559, and its local church. The bridges between Valverde and Meirinhos (in 1677), and the Remondes bridge, between Mogadouro and Macedo de Cavaleiros (in 1678) were also constructed with the patronage of the T√°voras. In addition, the family supported the constructions of a few churches and altars in various municipalities throughout the 17th‚Äì18th century, including the Convent of S√£o Francisco, the Matriz Church of Mogadouro, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ascens√£o, in the heights of Serra da Castanheira and many others. But, by act of King Joseph I the T√°voras lands were confiscated by the Marquess of Pombal, and members of the family executed after an attempted- assassination of the monarch. The annilhation of the family resulted in the loss of development impetus. The municipal archive, installed in the Convent of S√£o Francisco (today the Mogadouro Municipal Chamber) burned down in 1881 (and again later in 1927). After the extinction of the monastic orders, by the Liberal government, the Convent of S√£o Francisco was appropriated to store public records and local administration. By the 19th century, few of the noble families were interested in their holdings in Mogadouro, nor did they do much to develop these lands. By the end of the 20th century, only the poet-jurist Jos√© Francisco Trindade Coelho defended his land rights, and the region was abandoned by the central hierarchy of Lisbon. The Sabor line, a narrow gauge railway, served the community between 1930 and 1988. Geography The Mirand√™s plateau region of Mogadouro, who to several species of hare, rabbit and partridge The Bemposta Dam in the heart of the Douro region of Mogadouro =Physical geography= The municipality of Mogadouro, situated in the Tr√°s- os-Montes region of northeastern Portugal, in the traditional district of Bragan√ßa. It is boxed by the northeastern municipalities of Vimioso, Macedo de Cavaleiros, Alf√¢ndega da F√©, Torre de Moncorvo and Freixo de Espada √† Cinta. It is separated from the Spanish province of Castilla y Le√≥n, by the river- valley of the Douro River, whose margins are cut by v-shaped inclines. The territory of Mogadouro is naturally delimited by environment of the Rivers Douro and Sabor. A great part of the territory of the Mogadouro belongs to the Mirand√™s Plateau (which is an extension of the Iberian Meseta), lands rich fertile fields responsible for the cultivation of cereals (such as wheat, oats, and rye), supporting cattle and sheep herds (including the Mirandese and Terra Quente breeds). Two sheltered valleys, with micro-climates, support vineyards, olive, orange and almond orchards, as well as other Mediterranean products. The area around the Douro is a zone of granite escarpments of large blocks, resulting in a relief that is shaped by schists interrupted by quartz rocks that form the mountains. In the southern part of this area, dominated by the Sabor basin, there are different layers of schists. The soils, and climatic characteristics, have resulted in a diversified coverage that change throughout the year. Average median altitudes reach 700 metres, above sea level, although there are exceptions, as is the case with the Cimos de Mogadouro (usually around 900 m). Ecoregions/Protected areas Mogadouro is also the seat for the Parque Natural do Douro Internacional (International Douro Natural Park), a protected wilderness that includes primarily the slopes of the Douro valley, but also lands designated as bird sanctuaries for species of eagle (specifically the Bonelli and golden eagles), the griffon and Egyptian vultures, and the rare black stork, in addition to the red-billed chough, the alpine swift and the black wheatear. During the months of April and May, the flowering trees highlight the landscapes of many of the parishes. Mountain perennials (such as rosemary, Cytisus striatus and heather) are also common, although the Fagaceae (a species of beech) and holly oak, cork oak and juniper (which grow along the slopes of the Douro and Sabor valleys) are the predominant species. =Climate= Located in the southern part of the Mirand√™s Plateau, the region is influenced by three climatic systems: the Atlantic, the Continent and the Mediterranean. As a result, its agriculture is varied and its landscape is full of contrasts. In the winter, the climate is rigorously cold and icy, with snowfall common throughout the period. In the summer, its is susceptible to torrid heat, typical of continental climates, that supports a dry vegetation. =Human geography= The municipality of Mogadouro has, over the last decades, suffered an enormous depopulation, resulting in the concentration into the urbanized areas, and emigration to the coastal communities of Portugal. Like many of the Transmontana communities, Mogadouran hamlets built on traditional homes adapted to the climate of the region, built of granite or schist material, with verandas or balconies used to dry clothing, hang/dry onions and pumpkins/squash, or generalling conserve foodstuffs. The modernization of these traditional communities has ironically resulted in the destruction of Transmontan patrimony. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } Administratively, the municipality is divided into 21 civil parishes (freguesias): * Azinhoso * Bemposta * Bru√ß√≥ * Brunhoso * Brunhozinho, Castanheira e Sanhoane * Castelo Branco * Castro Vicente * Meirinhos * Mogadouro, Valverde, Vale de Porco e Vilar de Rei * Paradela * Penas R√≥ias * Peredo da Bemposta * Remondes e Soutelo * Saldanha * S√£o Martinho do Peso * T√≥ * Travanca * Urr√≥s * Vale da Madre * Vila de Ala * Vilarinho dos Galegos e Ventozelo Economy Mogadouro is essentially a rural area, supported by agriculture and animal by-products. In addition to the primary sector, Mogadouro supports a diverse industrial sector, with warehouses, shops and industries linked to agriculture. Along the Mirand√™s Plateau, cereal crops (in particular wheat) and forage allows the support of a large dairy industry. Mogadouro is one of the most productive milk suppliers in the north. Mogadouro is also a land known for almond production. Principally, in the fields of Valverde, Meirinhos, S√£o Pedro, Souto, Roca, Santo Andr√© and S√£o Martinho do Peso, these lands are covered in flowering trees seasonally, used in harvesting of the legumes. In other periods, the horse culture was important in this region, not just in agriculture and transport, but also as a centre of equestrian training and breeding; the Quinta de Nogueira was well known as the second most important estate for the breeding and raising of horses, after the Quinta de Alter do Ch√£o. During the stewardship of the T√°voras (between the 15th and 18th century), the Quinta de Nogueira and Quinta Nova (which were contiguous) were an economic pole of the family. Hunting is another important part of the local economy: in forested areas wild boar is typical; in short brush biomes, partridge and hare; and in the gardens and vegetable fields, rabbit is typical. This is an important economic benefit, not only attracting tourists, but hunting parties to the restaurants and residences in the region annually. During hunting season, many of the local hunting \\"lodges\\" are occupied with hunters and their associations, who travel into the region specifically for these species. Culture =Tradition= Local artisanship is also strong. The Associa√ß√£o Cultural e Recreativa de Soutelo (in Soutelo)) has promoted much of the traditional products of wool and cotton, including quilts, towels, embroidery, sericulture, metal-smithing, basket-weaving, rural miniatures. A local artisan has also produced artefacts in clay, reproducing faithfully the traditional techniques employed in Mogadouro and Nordeste Transmontanan. The Nordeste Transmontanan gastronomy includes a variety of simple rural dishes, many of which include cured meats and sausages (presunto, alheira, bulhos (bone sausage), blood chouri√ßo, lingui√ßa,bochas, chabianos (sausage of course flour, fat and semolina), vil√µes, tabafeias and salpic√£o, which are considered the kings of gastronomy in the region. On many plates there are the customary portion of the Mirand√™s veal (raised naturally in the pastures of the region and grilled over open flames), the marr√£ (pork, primarily bacon, grilled similarly), the sopa de xis(traditional made with blood), the cascas com bulho (dried green bean pods cooked with bulhos, bochas, fattened-pork meat and other embutidos), sopas das segadas (codfish and garlic soup),cabritinho serrano (baby goat), cordeiro churro assado na brasa (lamb grilled over flame), and greens. Local cheeses (goat and sheep), honey, econ√≥micos, roscos, matraf√µes, folar da P√°scoa, rosinhas (a traditional sweet from Bru√ß√≥), formigos and tantas round out the peculiar digestive and aperitifs of the region. Mogadouro is the central community, with a Preparatory () and Secondary School () serving the large border frontier. Regional policies have allowed the advancement of local projects and initiatives and supported the active participation of its local citizens: there are 30 cultural and recreational associations coordinated by the Projecto Cultural initiative, based in Mogadouro.

It is thought to also play a role in analysis of logical conditions (i.e., logical order of events) and encoding visual memories. It is named after its shape, which is somewhat similar to a tongue. Contrary to the name, the region has little to do with speech. It is believed that a hypermetabolism of the lingual gyrus is associated with visual snow.Gray. Henry. Peter L. Williams. and Henry Gray. Gray's Anatomy. Edinburgh: C. Livingstone. 1989. Print. Location The lingual gyrus of the occipital lobe lies between the calcarine sulcus and the posterior part of the collateral sulcus; behind, it reaches the occipital pole; in front, it is continued on to the tentorial surface of the temporal lobe, and joins the parahippocampal gyrus.Mendoza. John E.. and Anne L. Foundas. Clinical Neuroanatomy: A Neurobehavioral Approach. New York: Springer. 2008. Print. Function =Role in vision= This region is believed to play an important role in vision and dreaming. Visual memory dysfunction and visuo-limbic disconnection have been shown in cases where the lingual gyrus has been damaged (due to stroke or other traumatic brain injuries). Further, impaired visual memory is related to either damage to the region or disconnections between the gyrus and other brain structures. Hypermetabolism in the lingual gyrus has been associated with visual snow syndrome. Lingual gyrus activation has been linked to encoding of complex images. Subjects were scanned using fMRI while looking at pictures. The images were emotionally neutral, with no people in close-up. Subjects were tasked with memorizing the images for recognition at a later date. Data from the fMRI showed activation in several structures, notably the lingual gyrus. Similar activation was recorded during the recollection several weeks later. It has also been shown that activation of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, including the lingual gyrus, is related to the processing of visual information about parts of human faces. Furthermore, the left lingual gyrus activates during memorizing and maintaining images of human faces in working memory. Activation of the lingual gyrus has been shown in selective visual attention studies. Subjects were tasked with memorizing symbols in certain visual fields while ignoring those in others. In some subjects, the lingual gyrus was activated. The hemispheric activation of the structure was dependent on which visual field the subject was focused on.Mangun, G. R., Buonocore, M. H., Girelli, M., & Jha, A. P. (1998). ERP and fMRI measures of visual spatial selective attention. Hum Brain Mapp, 6(5-6), 383-389. Hemispheric-dependent gyrus activation has also been shown by isolating visual fields rather than by diverting focus.Driver, J., & Spence, C. (2000). Multisensory perception: Beyond modularity and convergence. Current Biology, 10(20), R731-R735. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00740-5 =Role in word processing= The lingual gyrus is a structure in the visual cortex that plays an important role in the identification and recognition of words.Mechelli. A.. Humphreys. G. W.. Mayall. K.. Olson. A.. 8. Price. C. J. (2000). Differential effects of word length and visual contrast in the fusiform and lingual gyri during reading. Proc Biol Sci. 267(1455). 1909-1913. Studies have implicated the lingual gyrus as being involved in modulating visual stimuli (especially letters) but not whether or not the stimulus was a word. Further, the gyrus is related to the naming of stimuli.Howard. D.. Patterson. K..Wise. R.. Brown.W. D.. Friston. K.. Weiller. C. 8. Frackowiak. R. S. J. 1992 The cortical localization of the lexicons: positron emission tomography evidence. Brain 115. 1769-1782.Price. C. J.. Wise. R.. Watson. J.. Patterson. K.. Howard. D. 8. Frackowiak. R. S.

Theodore.W. 1995 Regional cerebral blood flow during object naming and word reading. Hum. Brain Mapp. 3. 93\\"106. Furthermore, the gyrus has shown significant activation when moving from high to low contrast words as well as a correlation between word length and regional activation. In addition to recognition of letters, the region has been linked to semantic processing. Subjects with aphasia were tested with a variety of aphasia tests while undergoing fMRI to determine which areas were affected. Repetition of stimuli led to modulation in the lingual gyrus in subjects not afflicted, while those with aphasia showed significantly less modulation.Heath, S., McMahon, K. L., Nickels, L., Angwin, A., Macdonald, A. D., van Hees, S., . . . Copland, D. A. (2012). Neural mechanisms underlying the facilitation of naming in aphasia using a semantic task: an fMRI study. BMC Neurosci, 13(1), 98. doi: 10.1186/1471-2202-13-98 Similarly, the region is activated by non-verbal, logic-based conditions. Subjects tasked with attributing intentions to characters in comic strips showed activation in the gyrus when comparing physical logic with and without characters. For example: if a subject was intended to determine what a character will do, the region will activate. Conversely, if the comic depicted a physical event without characters, the region was relatively dormant.Brunet, E., Sarfati, Y., Hardy- Bayl√©, M.-C., & Decety, J. (2000). A PET Investigation of the Attribution of Intentions with a Nonverbal Task. NeuroImage, 11(2), 157-166. doi: 10.1006/nimg.1999.0525 Additional studies have shown a relationship between memorization and activation in the gyrus. When subjects were tasked with pairing abstract nouns with either visual imagery or sentence generation, many areas in the occipital lobe ‚Äì namely the lingual gyrus ‚Äì showed task-selective memory effects. This effect was primarily linked to visual imagery, as there were no significant effects associated with sentence generation.Leshikar, E. D., Duarte, A., & Hertzog, C. (2012). Task-Selective Memory Effects for Successfully Implemented Encoding Strategies. [Article]. PLoS ONE, 7(5). doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0038160 This link between memory and the gyrus extends to retrieval fluency in children, as well. Studies have shown elevated signals in the lingual gyrus when subjects were tasked with retrieval of facts while problem solving. Control samples show the activation is not linked to the problem solving itself, rather the recollection. This suggests a potential link between the lingual gyrus and hippocampal regions in the brain.Cho, S., Metcalfe, A. W. S., Young, C. B., Ryali, S., Geary, D. C., & Menon, V. (2012). Hippocampal-Prefrontal Engagement and Dynamic Causal Interactions in the Maturation of Children's Fact Retrieval. [Article]. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 24(9), 1849-1866. Furthermore, the gyrus is potentially linked to the amygdala. Gyrus activation was observed when subjects were tasked with verbalizing high-emotion words in contrast to neutral-emotion words.Isenberg, N., Silbersweig, D., Engelien, A., Emmerich, S., Malavade, K., Beattie, B., . . . Stern, E. (1999). Linguistic threat activates the human amygdala. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 96(18), 10456-10459. A second study linked the regions with high-emotion images. When subjects were shown emotional images, the amygdala and lingual gyrus both activated significantly more when compared to neutral-emotion images.Kehoe, E. G., Toomey, J. M., Balsters, J. H., & Bokde, A. L. (2012). Healthy aging is associated with increased neural processing of positive valence but attenuated processing of emotional arousal: an fMRI study.

Satawal is the easternmost island in the Yap island group and is located approximately east of Lamotrek. Geography The island, which measures long northeast-southwest, is up to wide and sits atop a small platform-like reef with a narrow fringing reef. The total land area is , and is thickly wooded with coconut and breadfruit trees. As there are no anchorages for large boats, Satawal is seldom visited by outsiders. Administratively Piagailoe Atoll, located 71 kilometers to the northwest, belongs to Satawal municipality.Administration Culture The native language is Satawalese, a Trukic language closely related to Woleaian, and the entire population of the island numbers approximately 500. Although located in Yap State, the people of Satawal are more closely related, culturally and linguistically, to those of Chuuk. The Satawalese primarily subsist on fishing and some agriculture (coconuts, breadfruit, taro). They build small thatch houses for sleeping and use the trunks of breadfruit trees for boat-building. Cultural forms primarily revolve around dance and story-telling, and an alcoholic beverage known as tuba (a palm wine) is brewed from fermented coconut milk. History As with all of the Caroline Islands, sovereignty passed from Spain to the Empire of Germany in 1899. The island came under the control of the Empire of Japan after World War I, and was subsequently administered under the South Seas Mandate. Following World War II, the island came under the control of the United States of America and was administered as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1947, and became part of the Federated States of Micronesia from 1979. On March 18, 1994, the freighter Oceanus ventured out of the main shipping channel when its captain attempted to peek at topless Satawalese women. The freighter ran aground on the nearby Wenimong Reef, the primary source of food for the islanders, and 13,000 square meters of the reef were ravaged. The freighter's insurer, the North of England P&I; Association, ended up paying US$2 million in compensation to the Satawalese. Expert navigators The island is best known for its preservation of traditional navigational techniques without the use of instruments, based on indigenous astronomical and maritime concepts. Despite its small population, Satawal has continued to produce ocean-going canoes and expert navigators versed in these traditions. The best-known of the Satawal master navigators (paliuw), Mau Piailug, served as mentor and teacher to the founding members of the Polynesian Voyaging Society. The daily life of Satawal is documented in the Steve Thomas book The Last Navigator, which also treats Mau Piailug's traditional navigation system in some depth. Sanford J. Low produced THE NAVIGATORS: Pathfinders of the Pacific, a documentary film about Mau Piailug and communal life on Satawal including food preparation, fishing and boat building. On March 18, 2007, Piailug presided over the first Pwo ceremony for navigators on Satawal in 56 years. At the event five native Hawaiians and eleven others were inducted into Pwo as master navigators. The Polynesian Voyaging Society presented Piailug a canoe, the Alingano Maisu, as a gift for his key role in reviving traditional wayfinding navigation in Hawaii.

He was well known among San Francisco Bay Area basketball players in the late 1980s, but in spite of his considerable talents, he did not reach the National Basketball Association (NBA). Among the NBA players who grew up with Mitchell, and now speak of his talent with great admiration, are Brian Shaw, Antonio Davis, and All-Stars Jason Kidd and Gary Payton Many have suggested he had the ability to become one of the greatest NBA stars of all time. He attended McClymonds High School and played for local college teams, but is best known for his dominance in local streetball tournaments. Mitchell was listed in Complex magazine as #11 on a list of the \\"20 Greatest Basketball Players to Never Play in the NBA.\\"  Early life  Mitchell grew up in the Lower Bottoms in West Oakland, living at least for a time across from South Prescott Park. According to his childhood friends, Mitchell had an unstable home as a child, and was driven to the streets by a longing for community. He described the challenges of resisting drug dealers as a child, while his family struggled financially. He played for McClymonds High School, along with Antonio Davis, in the 1980s. His academic struggles initially prevented him from attending college; he excelled in local 3-on-3 basketball tournaments, and would impress audiences by dunking over cars. He played one season for Merritt College and two seasons at Contra Costa College. The highest level he reached was playing for what was then known as Cal State Hayward, though he later conceded that he had not enrolled as a student. The playground basketball star's descent into drugs and crime destroyed any chance he had of becoming a professional athlete. In 1999, he was convicted of armed robbery of a video store; he spent the next five years in prison, during which time he converted to Islam, changed his name to Waliyy Abdur Rahim, and competed in prison games. Much of the footage for the documentary Hooked was shot during visits with him in prison. Recent life Mitchell was released from prison on April 4, 2004. He had served 51 months in prison after being charged with an armed robbery at a Blockbuster store. Mitchell went to training camp with the Golden State Warriors but was cut. Most notably, he did a photo shoot for Dime Magazine. Mitchell signed a contract with Reebok and his biography is out on video and DVD. He was incarcerated again, and released in May 2011. Mitchell is also said to have joined the YPA (Young Players Association) mixtape squad. Demetrius is the coach and founder of the Oakland Mountain Dew Xtreme, a well known AAU basketball team in California. Hooked documentary The documentary Hooked: The Legend of Demetrius \\"Hook\\" Mitchell, released in 2003, traces the life of Demetrius Mitchell, who, at 5-feet-10, built his legendary playground status because of his amazing hops that enabled him to dunk 360 degrees over a late model Honda Accord car. Milwaukee Bucks forward Drew Gooden credits Demetrius with the feat of a 360 degree dunk over a car. Mitchell says his best dunk ever was a backboard-shattering dunk off an alley-oop. The \\"Hook\\" says that he has been playing above the rim since he was 5'3\\", but did not dunk in organized games until he had attained the height of 5'5\\". Filmmakers Michael Skolnik and William O'Neill interviewed Mitchell in prison, where he described his rough upbringing on the streets of Oakland, and his struggle to survive. The filmmakers also interviewed several NBA stars who also grew up in Oakland, including Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, Antonio Davis, Drew Gooden, and Brian Shaw, all of whom played with Mitchell on the streets and were astonished by his skills. Mitchell himself is shown playing prison league games and is surprisingly still able to play above the rim. The film's soundtrack was produced by DJ Premier. Hooked had its world premiere at the 2003 Tribeca Film Festival. Hooked was released on DVD by Razor & Tie in October 2004 and was previewed at more than 20 film festivals in the U.S., including the Tribeca Film Festival, and garnered awards in 2003, ranging from \\"Best Documentary\\" to bronze medal at the Rhode Island Film Festival, San Francisco Black Film Festival, San Francisco World Film Festival and Worldfest Houston. Mitchell was also a primary subject, along with Leon Powe, of the 55 minute 2012 Comcast Sports documentary The Town Game: Two Lives, Two Paths.

The plantar calcaneal spur: a review of anatomy, histology, etiology and key associations. Journal of Anatomy: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joa.12607/full Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. It is a form of exostosis. When a foot is exposed to constant stress, calcium deposits build up on the bottom of the heel bone. Generally, this has no effect on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis. Signs and symptoms Inferior calcaneal spur Major symptoms consist of pain in the region surrounding the spur, which typically increases in intensity after prolonged periods of rest. Patients may report heel pain to be more severe when waking up in the morning. Patients may not be able to bear weight on the afflicted heel comfortably. Running, walking, or lifting heavy weight may exacerbate the issue. Causes Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. When stress is put on the plantar fascia ligament, it does not cause only plantar fasciitis, but causes a heel spur where the plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. Generally, a calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. Diagnosis Spur outgrowths can be detected through physical exam followed by a lateral foot x-ray. Treatment It is often seen as a repetitive stress injury, and thus lifestyle modification is typically the basic course of management strategies. For example, a person should begin doing foot and calf workouts. Strong muscles in the calves and lower legs will help take the stress off the bone and prevent heel spurs. Icing the area is an effective way to get immediate pain relief.

The film's storyline concerns a team of archaeologists investigating Mayan ruins, who come across a creature that is a shapeless, amorphous blob. They manage to defeat it using fire, while keeping a sample of the creature. Meanwhile, a comet is due to pass close to the Earth, the very same comet that passed near the Earth at the time the Mayan civilization collapsed, raising the question: \\"Is there a connection between the creature and the comet\\"? Made with the foreign market in mind, Galatea Film started exploring other genres after the success of their film Hercules (1958), which led to Riccardo Freda being tasked to direct Caltiki ‚Äì The Immortal Monster. Freda left the project during filming, later explaining that he wanted to give his friend, the cinematographer Mario Bava a chance to direct and earn more on the project. In interviews done long after the release of the film, both Freda and Bava gave conflicting opinions on who should be considered the real director of Caltiki. Various historians and ministerial papers suggest that Bava did create a large amount of footage of the film involving death scenes, the monster, matching shots and special effects scenes. The film was released in Italy on 8 August 1959, where it grossed less than Bava's and Freda's previous genre collaboration I Vampiri. Plot A delirious archaeologist stumbles into his group's camp without his partner, both of whom have been exploring a nearby cave. He quickly goes mad, requiring hospitalization. Their interest piqued by this strange turn of events, the group sets out for the cave. Once there, they find a deep pool of water, behind which is a large statue of Caltiki, the vengeful Mayan goddess who was ceremonially presented with human sacrifices. Hoping to find artifacts, the group sends one of their own down into the pool. At the bottom, he finds a menagerie of skeletons clad in gold jewelry. Running out of oxygen, he comes back up, clutching as much gold as he can carry. Although wishing that he not go down again, he insists on doing so, suggesting that they could become wealthy from the treasures below. Relenting, they let him descend once more. As he collects more and more treasure, his cable to the surface suddenly begins to move erratically. Fearing for his safety, the group pulls him back to the surface, only to find, upon removing his face mask, that his flesh has been reduced to a decayed mass over his skeleton. Moments later, the shapeless creature that attacked him rears up from the pool, attempting to digest anyone within reach. One of the group is briefly caught by the arm but is then rescued. As the team escapes, the shapeless mass begins to crawl out of the cave. Nearby, there is a tanker truck full of gasoline. One of the scientists drives the truck directly into the moving mass, which violently explodes and sets fire to the blob, destroying it. The team returns to Mexico City to take their injured colleague to a hospital. Still on his arm is a small piece of the blob, which is slowly digesting him. The surgeons carefully remove the creature, wrapping it up. They find that his arm is nothing more than a few moist scraps of flesh still connected to the underlying bones. After further experimenting on the creature, scientists discover that it is a unicellular bacterium that quickly grows when in the presence of radiation. A comet emitting radiation, that crosses Earth's path only once in every 850 years, is quickly approaching. At the comet's closest approach to Earth, the remaining piece of the blob removed during the surgery begins expanding to an enormous size and reproducing. Unfortunately, the removed sample of creature is stored in the home of expedition member Dr. John Fielding (John Merivale). While attempting to convince the Mexican government to send its army to destroy the reproducing blobs, Fielding is arrested, but manages to escape. A colleague finally convinces the authorities to sound an alarm, because the multiplying creatures will soon be beyond even their ability to control. The government marshals a regiment of soldiers equipped with flamethrowers and jeeps and sends them to Dr. Fielding's home. Upon their arrival, they find that the amorphous blobs have continued to multiply and have overrun the house and grounds. Dr. Fielding's wife and child have been forced to hide on a second-floor window ledge to escape being devoured. Fielding arrives just in time to save them, just as the arrayed soldiers lay waste to the creatures with torrents of fire.

Very few sound films in Italy were science fiction films at this point, with Sergio Corbucci's comedy film Baracca e burattini made in 1954 and Steno's Tot√≤ nella luna and The Day the Sky Exploded from 1958. Caltiki was produced by Nello Santi for Galatea Film, who were interested in exploring new genres of film after the success of Hercules (1957), and produced Caltiki with foreign markets in mind. Not mentioned in any credits or ministerial papers, European sources list the participation of the French company Climax Film in the production. Prints in the U.S. version of the film stated that the film was a \\"Samuel Schneider presentation\\", leading to some sources speculating that the film was an Italian and U.S. co-production. =Director= Director Riccardo Freda was angered by the way producers and other filmmakers had his cinematographer Mario Bava work on previous films, specifically films of Pietro Francisci. Freda concocted a way to push Bava into the director's chair of Freda's next film, Caltiki ‚Äì The Immortal Monster; he left the project early. Bava had been hired again as the film's cinematographer, while Filippo Sanjust was hired as the film's screenwriter, having co-written Freda's previous film Beatrice Cenci (1956). Freda also contributed to the script without credit. Specific information on how much Freda and Bava directed the film differ between interviews and recollections. Freda noted with an interview with Luigi Cozzi in 1971 that he \\"left it when there were just two days of shooting left. I did shoot it yes, but it's Bava's type of film. I don't enclose it in my body of work. The only thing I remember with pleasure about it are the statues that decorated the sets: I sculpted them myself.\\" Bava described Caltiki ‚Äì The Immortal Monster as \\"my very first film\\", while noting that Freda had fled the set \\"because everything was falling to pieces. I managed to carry it out, patching it up here and there\\". Cozzi commented on his interview with Freda in 2004, stating that his own words were misinterpreted and that \\"the truth is only one: the director of Calitiki il mostro immortale is Riccardo Freda, full stop. Mario Bava did take care of the cinematography, the special effects and directed the scenes with the miniatures (that is, mostly the tanks....), and in addition to that he filmed some shots of soldiers with flame throwers. That's all, and of course it cannot be enough to say that Bava directed that movie.\\" Cozzi also stated that Bava spoke about the film, stating that \\"I did not direct Caltiki. The director of that movie is Freda. Only at a certain point, after principal shooting ended, Freda started editing the picture and then he had a big argument with the producer [...] Then Freda walked out.\\" Bava's statement from Cozzi then noted that Bava finished some special effects shot, scenes with soldiers with flame throwers for the ending of the film and declared \\"that does not mean I was the director of Caltiki: that is a Riccardo Freda film.\\" According to Bava's biographer Tim Lucas, Freda's walk-off left \\"two or three weeks of filming\\", leaving Bava to shoot over 100 special effects shots for a 76-minute long production. Massimo De Rita, who worked as a unit manager for Galatea, spent time on the set of Caltiki and opined that \\"at 90 percent Bava was also the director of Caltiki. Freda was away, he didn't know anything about what Bava was contriving.\\" De Rita noted that Bava told actors what to do and that Bava shot all the connecting shots with the monster and all the death scenes. Ministerial papers also note the Bava and Freda's roles in the film. The final balance in the film assigns Freda 5,000,000 lire, instead of the initial 6,000,000 and that Bava was paid 6.250 million lire, instead of his initial 3,000,000. Release Caltiki - The Immortal Monster was released theatrically in Italy on 8 August 1959 where it was distributed by Lux Film. In Italy the film was less successful than Freda's and Bava's film I Vampiri, which had grossed ‚Ç§125.3 million Italian lire. Caltiki grossed a total of 94.15 million lire domestically. The film was distributed theatrically in the U.S. in September 1960 by Allied Artists as Caltiki ‚Äì The Immortal Monster. The English-language dub of the film was created in New York by Titra Studios, which dubbed many of the Italian films from this period. It was released in the U.K. in 1962. =Home media= Caltiki - The Immortal Monster was published as a photonovel in the magazine I Vostri Film in the July 1, 1962 issue. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Arrow Video on April 11, 2017.  Critical reception  From contemporary reviews, The Monthly Film Bulletin commented that \\"phony sets, bad acting and limitations of a small budget seriously hamper the first half\\" and that \\"once the monster asserts itself things begin to liven up.\\" The review concluded that the film was \\"so incredibly banal that it almost entertains.\\" Wanada Hale of the New York Daily News referred to Caltiki as a \\"feeble horror film\\" and that \\"Not only the story is bad; so are the production, the direction, the dubbing and the acting\\" Among retrospective reviews, Bruce Eder of AllMovie gave the film a generally positive review, calling it \\"a neat and compelling science fiction- horror amalgam, squeezing cosmology together with archaeology and myth to create a genuinely fascinating and original thriller.\\" In Phil Hardy's book Science Fiction (1984), a review described the film as a \\"minor outing [...] though the acting is routine and the script leaden, Bava injects a few stylish flourishes.\\" Slant Magazine stated that the film \\"remains an impressive showcase for Bava's inimitable skills behind the camera, in particular his uncanny ability to craft moody atmosphere and some extremely grisly imagery (for 1959, anyhow) out of the simplest and most frugal of cinematic means.\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1959 * List of horror films of the 1950s * List of science fiction films of the 1950s References =Citations= =Bibliography=   Warren, Bill.

Philosophaster is a Latin satirical comedy by Robert Burton. He began writing the play in 1606 and completed it by 1615.According to the title page of Burton's manuscript. Burton originally wrote 'Inchoata 1606' (begun) and changed the 'Inchoata' to 'Scripta' (written) later. See page xi of William E. Buckley's preface to his Roxburghe Club publication of Philosophaster, comoedia, nunc primum in lucem producta. Poemata, antehac sparsim edita, nunc in unum collecta / auctore Roberto Burtono 1862. It was performed by students in the Hall of Christ Church, Oxford on 16 February 1618 (New StyleThe dates in the manuscripts of the play are in 'Old Style' in which the year ends on 24 March.). The play was not published in Burton's lifetime, and it remained in manuscript till 1862 when it was edited by William Edward Buckley and published by the Roxburghe Club. It was first translated into English by Paul Jordan-Smith and published by Stanford University Press, California in 1931.Holbrook Jackson in his Introduction to Burton‚Äôs Anatomy of Melancholy, London: J.M. Dent & Sons Ltd., 1972, p. vi and footnote. Since the play is about someone who pretends to be a philosopher, the term itself has been used in more recent times to refer to a pretender to philosophy.  Plot  A university is established by the Duke of Osuna in the small town of Osuna in Andalusia, Spain. The university is well- endowed, and it offers salaries and other incentives for students and academics all over Europe. Unfortunately, as well as honest and reputable people, the new university also attracts 'philosophasters' or sham philosophers. These include confidence tricksters, fraudsters and others who are more interested in making money than in contributing to academic life. The play is about the havoc caused by these people and by prostitutes attracted to the town. The townspeople are outraged, and The Duke is inclined to close the university down. However, two scholars persuade him not to do so. Instead, he summons both the villains and the victims before a Tribunal. All the wrongs are righted, and the villains are punished. The two scholars are put in charge of the University which is established on a better footing. The play ends with everyone singing a hymn in praise of philosophy.Robert Burton's Philosophaster, with an English translation of the same. Together with his other minor writings in prose and verse. Translation, introduction and notes by Paul Jordan-Smith. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1931, pp. 5-9.  Characters  = Philosophasters = The philosophasters in the play include: * Polupragmaticus ‚Äì a Jesuit priest who defrauded noblemen in the guise of a teacher, politician, courtier, theologian, or magician. * Pantomagus ‚Äì an alchemist and physician who plied fake medicines. He also deceived a nobleman into believing that he could produce mountains of gold through the practice of alchemy. He would disappear when he had bankrupted a household. * Pedanus ‚Äì a teacher of grammar who obtained by deception two livings or ecclesiastical posts and was plotting to become the Duke's chaplain. * Amphimacer ‚Äì a poetaster or sham poet who composed certain silly poems for his mistress and anyone else. * Theanus ‚Äì a theologaster or sham theologian who was lazy and idle. Background The background to the play is the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The play was written shortly after this Catholic plot to blow up King and Parliament, and it reflects the anti-catholic feeling of the time. Burton, in fact, refers to a real Duke of Osuna who set up a university in Osuna in 1548. He chose this university because Andalusian universities were very religious, pro-Catholic and peddled the worst kind of scholasticism. He is also attacking the Jesuits, who were very active in his time, and the play portrays them as anti-social villains: \\"The typical Jesuit is 'a notorious Bawd, & famous Fornicator, lascivum pecus, a very goat' (AM 1.40), and the Jesuits play many 'pranks'\\".See Kathryn Murphy, \\"Jesuits and Philosophasters: Robert Burton's Response to the Gunpowder Plot\\", Journal of the Northern Renaissance, 1:1 (Spring 2009), p.6.

Donnellan contributed to the philosophy of language, notably to the analysis of proper names and definite descriptions. He criticized Bertrand Russell's theory of definite descriptions for overlooking the distinction between referential and attributive use of definite descriptions.Lycan, William G., Philosophy of Language - a contemporary introduction (2000), pp. 26-30 Donnellan spent most of his career at UCLA, having also previously taught at the university where he had earned his PhD, Cornell University. Philosophical work =Proper names= By 1970, analytic philosophers widely accepted a view regarding the reference- relation that holds of proper names and that which they name, known as descriptivism and attributed to Bertrand Russell. Descriptivism holds that ordinary proper names (e.g., 'Socrates', 'Richard Feynman', and 'Madagascar') may be paraphrased by definite descriptions (e.g., 'Plato's favorite philosopher', 'the man who devised the theory of quantum electrodynamics', and 'the largest island off the southeastern coast of Africa'). Saul Kripke gave a series of three lectures at Princeton University in 1970, later published as Naming and Necessity, in which he argued against descriptivism and sketched the causal-historical theory of reference according to which each proper name necessarily designates a particular object and that the identity of the object so designated is determined by the history of the name's use. These lectures were highly influential and marked the decline of descriptivism's popularity. Kripke's alternative view was, by his own account, not fully developed in his lectures. Donnellan's work on proper names is among the earliest and most influential developments of the causal-historical theory of reference. =Descriptions= \\"Reference and Definite Descriptions\\" has been one of Donnellan's most influential essays. Written in response to the work of Bertrand Russell and P. F. Strawson in the area of definite descriptions, the essay develops a distinction between the \\"referential use\\" and the \\"attributive use\\" of a definite description. The attributive use most nearly reflects Russell's understanding of descriptions. When a person uses a description such as \\"Smith's murderer\\" attributively, they mean to pick out the individual that fits that description, whoever or whatever it is. The referential use, on the other hand, functions to pick out who or what a speaker is talking about, so that something can be said about that person or thing.

WTWS, known as 92.1 The Twister, is a 920-watt radio station broadcasting at 92.1 FM in Houghton Lake, MI, with a country music format. Formerly licensed to Harrison, Michigan and operated as a satellite of public radio station WVXU Cincinnati for several years and owned by Xavier University (then transferred to Cincinnati Classical Public Radio along with WVXU), the station was formerly owned by Sindy Fuller's Bridge to Bridge, Inc., owner of WUPS 98.5 Houghton Lake, Michigan, and adopted the \\"Twister\\" format in June 2006. The two stations were acquired on February 4, 2015 by Black Diamond Broadcast Group, owned by long-time broadcaster Mike Chires, at a purchase price of $1.65 million. Early years as WKKM For most of its years, WTWS was known as WKKM, \\"King of Kountry Music\\", \\"The Kountry King\\" and \\"The Mighty 92\\". The station signed on in March 1975 by David Carmine (aka Dave Carr to radio audiences), a former Detroit country radio personality and engineer, and later the author of Rockin' Down the Dial, a book about the history of Top 40 rock and roll radio in the Motor City. For its first few years, WKKM broadcast from a trailer, then from its transmitter building at 550 East Larch Road just outside of Harrison. Eventually the station's studios and offices were moved to 209 East Spruce Street in downtown Harrison. If WKKM was legendary for anything, it was their low budget presentation. The station used basic voice production instead of jingles. As radio stations started tossing out vinyl in the 1980s for CDs, WKKM didn't fully make the conversion. In the early 1990s, WKKM became almost exclusively a classic country format when record companies decided to stop shipping out records to radio stations; the station instead relied its vast library of 45s. One of the most obvious indications of WKKM's thriftiness was the fact that during its 27 years on the air, it never broadcast in stereo. According to Carmine, most of the records were in mono as it was, so why bother spending thousands of dollars to convert the station to stereo? Also, Carmine nicknamed the station \\"The Best Radio Station Radio Shack Ever Built\\", since it is rumored that parts and hardware for the station came from the electronics retailer. WKKM was also a fertile training ground for up-and-coming radio talent. Recent graduates of Detroit's Specs Howard School of Media Arts often had their first jobs at WKKM straight out of school before moving on to bigger markets. Sister stations: WDEE and WWKM In 1981, Carmine started what would later become an AM simulcast for WKKM, known as WDEE AM 1500, the call letters were taken from a legendary Detroit country station (The Big 'D'), and later given up. Carmine's WDEE, licensed to Reed City, the county seat of nearby Osceola County, and which had no radio station of its own, later became a tool for expanding WKKM's FM signal, which was weak and spotty in that particular area. Mr. Carmine operated WDEE AM from local studios at 410 W. Upton Ave. (which was then the city of Reed City offices), with local programming for several years, until converting it to the WKKM simulcast in the mid 1980s. The station failed to make any kind of financial inroads for Carmine, and he ended up turning the station off in October 1992, selling WDEE in 1994 to Beilfuss Broadcasting. Beilfuss Broadcasting was a company headed by Cadillac-Traverse City area radio programmer Steve Masters, who operated the station with an oldies format until 1997, when he put WDEE-FM 97.3 on the air and moved his operations south of Reed City to Big Rapids. WDEE, with its weak signal of 250 watts at a high dial position, barely made it ten miles outside its tower, and while off to a good start for Masters, it barely broke even financially. It continued as a simulcast outlet of its FM sister until 2001 when it began a short lived automated classic country format. Masters finally shut it off for good in 2002. In 1985, Carmine started another AM simulcast for WKKM, WWKM 1540. The station couldn't come at a worse time since AM radio in northern Michigan was good as dead during that period of time. It's well known that WWKM was a waste of money for Carmine, especially since its 1,000-watt daytime only signal only had a roughly 10-mile radius. During the time that both AM stations were simulcasting WKKM-FM, the positioner/ID voiceover used was \\"The Mighty 92, WKKM/WWKM FM/AM Harrison, WDEE Reed City\\". Also heard was \\"The Country King, WKKM plays more music!\\" Both were simple voice-over announcements, lacking any sort of jingle packing. Around 2000, the station had two full-time DJs: Ed Thomas (6 a.m.-1 p.m.) and M. A. Hanson (1-7 p.m.) with a simulcast of Saginaw's WKCQ 98.1 overnights. Up until the simulcast, the station was on the air for only 16 hours a day, signing on at 6:00 AM and signing off at 10:00PM (which was then the FCC minimum standard for commercial FM broadcast hours). The station had a news director, Charlie Cobb. WKKM had a full-service feel to it, as the station had religious programming all day Sunday, plus funeral announcements and Paul Harvey News and Comment. In 2001, the station ditched its WKCQ rebroadcast and played pre- recorded music all night. Carmine wanted to retire and sold WKKM to Xavier University in 2002 for $270,000. Under the deal, WKKM became a public radio station, WVXH, and simulcast Xavier's X-Star Radio Network, fed from WVXU Cincinnati. Xavier also owned two other stations in northern Michigan: WVXA 96.7 Rogers City, MI (now WRGZ) and WVXM 97.7 Manistee, MI (now WMLQ). WKKM: Another try at AM WWKM, however, was split off as Laurie Foster, Xavier's manager of northern Michigan stations, bought the station from Carmine for only $10. Foster acquired the WKKM call letters, put them on 1540, and made the station automated classic country. However, the station didn't make a profit and Foster sent the license back to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), silencing WWKM 1540 forever in 2004. WKKM was silenced on June 30, 2002 and brought back on as WVXH on July 18. Xavier did extensive work on the station, adding much-needed new equipment. For the first time ever, the station broadcast in stereo. WVXH broadcast X-Star's programs, which included old radio shows, adult standards, jazz, blues and even a rock show Saturday nights. However, the X-Star Network crumbled. In March 2005, Xavier sold X-Star to Cincinnati Classical Public Radio for $15 million. CCPR wasn't interested in broadcasting outside of Cincinnati, so they put all their stations--WVXH included-- on the block. In August, X-Star ceased operations and all of their stations simulcast WVXU full-time. Country music returns under a new name In March 2006, it was announced that John Salov--owner of WUPS 98.5 Houghton Lake ‚Äî was buying WVXH for $200,000, a $70,000 loss for Xavier/CCPR. Although 92.1 is once again a country-music station, it now plays contemporary hit country. The WWKM call letters were grabbed by WHYT, 88.1/89.1 Imlay City, in 2002 when it became available. Move to Houghton Lake As of October 2008, WTWS is broadcasting from new facilities licensed to Houghton Lake, with a power of 920 watts. After sister station WUPS, which primarily targets the Mount Pleasant area, was granted a construction permit to change its city of license to Harrison (with no change in facilities), WTWS received a construction permit to move to Houghton Lake in order that there would still be a radio station licensed to Houghton Lake. From the new facilities, 92.1 FM's signal in the southern part of its former 6,000-watt coverage area, such as Mount Pleasant and Clare, is significantly less strong, but the station can now be heard more clearly in former fringe coverage areas such as Houghton Lake, Higgins Lake, West Branch, St. Helen, and Roscommon, and northward to Grayling. However, a translator station on the same frequency in Gaylord (rebroadcasting Catholic station WTCK in Charlevoix) makes reception more difficult farther north. WKKM's brief return In 2008, a new 100-watt FM facility at 90.7 licensed to Harrison was granted the WKKM call letters after they were dropped by an Alpena-area contemporary Christian station that had been using them. This frequency was noted on the air in January 2011 with classic country music in mono, reminiscent of the original WKKM. The licensee was listed as \\"The Country King, Incorporated\\" in the FCC database. WKKM was granted its license to cover on August 9, 2011. However, the station's 100-watt signal barely made it out of the Harrison area and did not even reach Clare, giving WKKM a significantly truncated coverage area compared to the old 92.1 signal. WKKM was sold to West Central Michigan Media Ministries and became WBHL in September 2012, simulcasting the religious programming of WGCP in Cadillac. Under Media Ministries' ownership, 90.7 FM's power has been boosted to 10,000 watts and the station now easily covers all of central Michigan.

Locally referred to as the Portuguese Capital of Olive Oil, Vila Flor is located in the Terra Quente Transmontana, in the southern part of the district of Bragan√ßa. The population in 2011 was 6,697,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of .√Åreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e pa√≠s History The Roman fountain isolating human settlement to that period One of the remaining archway gates of the walled city of P√≥voa d¬¥√Ålem Sabor It was King Denis who, while travelling through the burg (then known as P√≥voa d¬¥√Ålem Sabor, became enchanted by the local landscape and, in 1286, renamed the district Vila Flor. Around 1295, the King ordered the construction of a walled city, consisting of five gates, to protect the fledgling settlement and guard Portuguese interests in the territory. During the Middle Ages, this bouquet of flowers, as Cabral Ad√£o once called it, became the home to many fleeing Jewish families, who settled in the territory to start farms, businesses of small industry (such as tanneries and jewelers). King Manuel eventually conferred on the settlement an official charter (foral), later to be reformulated in May 1512. An anti- Jewish, Manuel expelled the Jews from the municipality, whose remaining populous or army were then responsible for destroying the remaining homes. Geography The mountainous terrain that divides the Vale de Vilari√ßa The municipal council offices and building along Avenida Marchel Carmona Administratively, the municipality is divided into 14 civil parishes (freguesias): * Assares e Lod√µes * Benlhevai * Candoso e Carvalho de Egas * Freixiel * Roios * Sam√µes * Sampaio * Santa Comba de Vilari√ßa * Seixo de Manhoses * Trindade * Vale Frechoso * Valtorno e Mour√£o * Vila Flor e Nabo * Vilas Boas e Vilarinho das Azenhas Economy Rich in history, tradition, monuments and citizenry, the municipality is also an important reference for agriculture, owing to the fertility of the Vale da Vilari√ßa. Companies, such as Frize and Sousacamp, known within and outside of Portugal, are located in within its frontiers. The growth of tourism has meant that lodgings have developed throughout the region, including hotels, establishments catering to rural- and agro-tourism. This includes the seasonal treks in the region to the municipalities camping site. Notable citizens * Joaquim Trigo de Negreiros (born 1900), lawyer and official of the civil registry, president of the administrative council of Vila Flor, before moving to Porto, becoming assistance Attorney of Portugal, Civil Governor of Porto, Subsecretary of State for Corporations and Social Security, and the Secretary of State for Social Security, in addition to providing public security forces with new equipment. For eight years he was minister of the Domestic Affairs, closed Tarrafal in 1954, and as member of the Parliament in various legislatures, he was responsible for implementing the modern public health system: he originated the Hospital Escolar de Santa Maria and the Hospital of S√£o Jo√£o (in Porto), he was also responsible for the growth in nursing instruction (in 1947). He was a founder of the Di√°rio Popular. * Artur Guilherme Trigo Vaz (born 1919), doctor, municipal councillor (1951‚Äì54 and 1964‚Äì68), president of the municipal council (1970‚Äì74), responsible for Peneireiro Dam, and president/founder of the Sport Clube de Vila Flor; Vaz also dedicated himself to the history of Vila Flor, publishing the O Passado e o Presente, in December 1949. * Raul de S√° Correia (May 1900 - 8 December 1993), municipal secretary (1934), responsible for the construction of the library, museum and archive. On his retirement he was named honorary citizen of the municipality and attributed a commemorative medal marking the 7th centenary of Vila Flor; a year later President M√°rio Soares honored him with Order of Henry the Navigator; and on his death a bronze bust was erected in front of his former home, and a hall in the museum dedicated to him. * Francisco Maria Guerra (1876 - 1962), lawyer and administrator of the municipality of Miranda do Douro; conservator of the district land registry and president of the municipality of Vila Flor (1933-1946), he was responsible for a series of public works including the construction of several primary schools, bridges, cemeteries, warehouses, fountains, the opening of many municipal roads, squares and avenues, including Avenida Marechal Carmona.

These classes receive closer scrutiny by courts when an Equal Protection claim alleging unconstitutional discrimination is asserted against a law, regulation, or other government action, or sometimes private action.  Federal classifications  Strict scrutiny is applied to government actions that affect groups that fall under a \\"suspect classification.\\" The US Supreme Court has mentioned a variety of criteria that, in some combination, may qualify a group as a suspect classification, but the Court has not declared that any particular set of criteria are either necessary or sufficient to qualify.Wintemute, Robert, Sexual Orientation and Human Rights (1995) Some of the criteria that have been cited include: * The group has historically been discriminated against or have been subject to prejudice, hostility, or stigma, perhaps due, at least in part, to stereotypes. * They possess an immutableLyng v. Castillo (1986) or highly visible trait. * They are powerless to protect themselves via the political process. (The group is a \\"discrete\\" and \\"insular\\" minority.See: U.S. v. Carolene Products.) * The group's distinguishing characteristic does not inhibit it from contributing meaningfully to society.See: Frontiero v. Richardson 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973). = Suspect class = The Supreme Court established the judicial precedent for suspect classifications in the cases of Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81 and Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944). The Supreme Court recognizes race, national origin, religion and alienage as suspect classes; it therefore analyzes any government action that discriminates against these classes under strict scrutiny. In Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in its Findings of Fact commented that sexual orientation could be considered a suspect class, but on the facts presented Proposition 8 failed even to satisfy the much more deferential rational basis review. The U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska held the same in Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning,Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning, 368 F. Supp. 2d 980 (D.Neb. 2005) but was reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning, 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006) As the law currently stands, neither sexual orientation nor gender identity is considered a federal suspect class, although many states do consider them such.  Alienage  Alienage, or the state of being an alien, i.e. a non-citizen of the United States, is a unique category. For purposes of state law, legal aliens are a suspect class (Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971)). As such, state actions are analyzed according to strict scrutiny. In contrast, because the United States Congress has the power to regulate immigration, federal government action that discriminates based on alienage will receive rational basis scrutiny. State acts that affect unlawful immigrants are generally analyzed with rational basis review unless the topic is education of children, in which case they are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny based on Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). = Quasi-suspect class = Intermediate scrutiny is applied to groups that fall under a \\"quasi-suspect classification.\\" GenderMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982). and legitimacy of birth have been held to be quasi-suspect classes. In 2012, the U.S. District Court for Northern California discussed this type of classification, but applied heightened scrutiny without specifically labeling gays and lesbians a suspect or quasi-suspect class in its decision.Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management, C 10-00257 (N.D. Cal. 2012). Striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in Windsor v. United States (2012), the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held sexual orientation to be a quasi-suspect classification, and determined that laws that classify people on such basis should be subject to intermediate scrutiny.Windsor v. United States, 12-2335-cv(L), October 18, 2012. It was the first time a federal court had applied quasi-suspect classification in a sexual orientation case. The Supreme Court, however, has not decided whether sexual orientation fits into any identified class. = All others = Rational basis scrutiny is applied to all other discriminatory statutes. Rational basis scrutiny currently covers all other discriminatory criteria‚Äîe.g., age, disability, wealth, political preference, political affiliation, or felons.  Levels of judicial review  = Strict scrutiny = To satisfy the strict scrutiny, suspect classifications such as race, alienage, or national origin must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest when there is no less restrictive alternative method available to accomplish the government (state's) interest. The practical result of this legal doctrine is that government sponsored discrimination on the account of a citizen's race, skin color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin is almost always unconstitutional, unless it is a compelling, narrowly tailored and temporary piece of legislation dealing with national security, defense, or affirmative action. Korematsu v. United States, regarding Japanese internment, and Grutter v. Bollinger, upholding affirmative action based upon racial diversity, are the only cases in which a racially discriminatory law has been upheld under the strict scrutiny test. Strict scrutiny is also applied to restrictions of any fundamental right, regardless of the group involved. = Intermediate scrutiny = When intermediate scrutiny is involved, the courts are more likely to oppose the discriminatory law when compared to a rational basis review particularly if a law is based on gender. However, a court will likely uphold a discriminatory law under intermediate scrutiny if the law has an exceedingly persuasive justification and applies to real, fact-based, or biological differences between the sexes. Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 102 S.Ct. 3331 (1982), Nguyen v. INS, 121 S.Ct. 2053 (2001). = Rational basis = When rational basis review is used, it means that the classification is one that overwhelmingly tends to be rational, e.g. distinguishing criminals from non-criminals. This leads to wide political discretion and a focus of judicial resources to other cases where the classification employed tends to be more suspicious, and thus close judicial balancing is needed.  Classifications under state law  The Supreme Court's holdings impose a minimum standard to which each State must adhere. Hence, a State law that discriminates against citizens because of their race, must be reviewed by the applicable State and inferior federal courts using the strict scrutiny basis of review. A State may, generally, choose to give its citizens more rights or protections than the minimum federal standard when considering state law. For example, in 2008 the Supreme Court of California used the strict scrutiny basis of review to strike down a California statute denying legal recognition of same-sex marriages. California classifies sexual orientation as a suspect class under state law. Connecticut and Iowa classify sexual orientation as a quasi-suspect class under their respective state laws.Stewart, Chuck, Homosexuality and the Law: A Dictionary (2001) References Civil rights and liberties * Legal doctrines and principles Anti-discrimination law in the United States ","title":"Suspect classification"},{"id":"4347197","text":"Lone Scouts of America (LSA) was a Scouting organization for American boys that operated from 1915 until it merged with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in 1924. The LSA was founded by W. D. Boyce, publisher of the Chicago Ledger and the Saturday Blade and one of the founders of the BSA. Boyce felt that the program of the BSA did not help the rural boy who could not find enough other boys to form a troop or a patrol. James E. West, the first Chief Scout Executive of the BSA, disagreed with Boyce's concept, believing that the 4-H program was fulfilling the role. After Boyce left the BSA, he started the Lone Scouts of America and incorporated it on January 9, 1915. Boyce became the executive officer or Chief Totem and Frank Allan Morgan became the editor of The Lone Scout. In October 1915, Boyce appointed all of his paperboys as members of the LSA and published the first issue of The Lone Scout magazine. Program The LSA program was inspired by the Lonecraft program of the British Boy Scout Association and by Ernest Thompson Seton's Woodcraft Indians program that used American Indian themes. No adult leaders were required in the Lone Scout program, and there were no age limits. By November 1915, over 30,000 members were reported. Lone Scouts who lived near each other could form a \\"local tribe\\", while others could form a \\"mail tribe\\" and communicate by post. Tribes could join together to form \\"wigwams\\". Tribes elected officers such as chief (president, initially called captain), sachem (vice-president), scribe (secretary) and wampum-bearer (treasurer). By October 1916, the LSA reported 133,000 members. By popular demand, a uniform was created in 1917 and the Lone Scout Supply Company was formed. Media The main link of the Lone Scouts of America was the weekly newspaper The Lone Scout, published by Boyce's company, and sold by Lone Scouts. Boys were encouraged to write articles, stories and cartoons for Lone Scout, and several prizes and contests were announced. Many tribes started their own local \\"tribe papers\\"‚Äì this later became part of a program that became the Authorized Lone Scout Amateur Publications (ALSAPs). By December 1920, financial difficulties forced Boyce to publish the magazine on a monthly basis and increase the price. The Tribe Paper Editors' Protective Association was formed to help maintain the quality of the more prestigious of the tribe papers. In 1924, a radio tribe was formed, sponsored by Sears, Roebuck and Co. Lone Scouts would read news stories on Sears' WLS radio station. In 2019 a Facebook page FRIENDS OF LONE SCOUTS OF AMERICA @lonescoutfriends was started and covers and pages of popular newsletters are being added weekly. Mainly THE ELBEETEE, published monthly by Charles J. Merlin, \\"in the interests of the Elbeetian Legion and Old Timers of the LSA so that they may not forget those friendships that took root in the days of our boyhood.\\" And the Lone Indian magazine for members of the Lone Indian Fraternity. It was started and published by Ernest Grube of Sheboygan WI. Advancement and recognition Badge of the LSA An advancement program was developed that was split into lodges. The Teepee Lodge consisted of the First Degree (Lone Scout), Second Degree (Woodcraft) and the Third Degree (Lone Eagle). The Totem Pole Lodge included the Fourth Degree (Lone Bachelor), Fifth Degree (Lone Woodsman) and Sixth Degree (Lone Hunter). The Sagamore Lodge consisted of the Seventh Degree (Sagamore). The literary competitions were awarded with Lone Scout Contributor (LSC), Lone Scout Scribe (LSS), Lone Scout Graduate (LSG) and Lone Scout Quill (LSQ). The Booster Award system recognized Lone Scouts who recruited new members and was awarded in two levels: Lone Scout Organizer (LSO) and Lone Scout Booster (LSB). A Lone Scout who earned Sagamore Degree, Lone Scout Booster and Lone Scout Quill was recognized as a Supreme Scout (SS)‚Äì 123 were presented. War Work medals recognized those Lone Scouts who performed service work during World War I. Final years The beginning of the end came in 1920, when Boyce hired the first professional editor for The Lone Scout magazine, George N. Madison. Madison discovered LSA's membership roster was wildly inaccurate and was full of duplications and inactive members. The magazine switched from a weekly to a monthly. By 1922, Boyce's newspaper business was suffering and The Lone Scout was losing money. Although membership was reported at 490,000 Lone Scouts in 1922, the editors of The Lone Scout realized that the numbers were wildly inflated. As Chicago entered the 1920s nadir of American race relations, The Lone Scout announced that they would no longer accept applications \\"from members of the negro race\\" and in 1922, the mast head of The Lone Scout changed from \\"A Real Boys Magazine\\" to \\"The White Boys' Magazine.\\" Boy Scouts of America BSA Lone Scout logo The Boy Scouts of America strongly defended their right to the usage of the term Scout, and West wrote to Boyce voicing his concerns, but the BSA never brought litigation against the LSA. In 1916, the BSA created the Pioneer Scout program in direct competition to the LSA, but it was never very successful. In April 1924, Boyce finally accepted James West's persistent offer of a merger with the BSA. On June 16, 1924 the merger was formalized. When The Lone Scout ceased publication, many of the boys dropped out of Scouting entirely. About 65,000 Lone Scouts transferred to the BSA, and membership peaked at 108,000 in 1926. The BSA ran the program unchanged for about a decade as the Lone Scout Service and then the Lone Scout Division. The unique program features were then eliminated and the Lone Scouts transitioned to the standard Boy Scout program. Lone Cub Scouts were added after the Cub Scouting program was introduced in 1930. The last issue of The Lone Scout in April 1924 announced the merger with the BSA. The BSA continued to print The Lone Scout for a short time before it was merged as a section of Boys' Life. Some of the more literary Lone Scouts later helped form the National Boy Scout Press Association. Both the Lone Scout and Lone Cub Scout programs continue to serve boys who cannot take part in a nearby troop or pack on a regular basis because of such factors as distance, time, disability or other difficulties. Legacy As a Lone Scout, Charles J. Merlin of Hudson Heights, New Jersey published a tribe paper called the Lone Beaver Tribune or LBT. In 1927 he formed the Elbeetian Legion to tie together former Lone Scouts and published the Elbeetee newsletter until his death in 1995. Merlin was recognized for his work when the BSA awarded him the Silver Buffalo Award in 1986. The Lone Indian Fellowship was formed in 1926 by Ernst Grube of Sheboygan, Wisconsin who published the monthly Lone Indian until his death in 1994. The Lone Scout Memory Lodge was built in 1970 and was located on Cannon Scout Reservation at Camp John J. Barnhardt, Central North Carolina Council in New London, North Carolina. The lodge contains memorabilia from the Lone Scout days and a print shop museum that contains printing presses and type elements used to print many of the tribe papers. The Lone Scout Foundation was established to maintain and promote the lodge. In 2006, the building was re- purposed and the collection was transferred to the Ottawa Scouting Museum in Ottawa, Illinois.

It employs 13,331 people, and handles 5.7 million customer accounts. History EDF Energy Customers (trading as EDF Energy) is wholly owned by the French state owned EDF (√âlectricit√© de France) and was formed in January 2002, following the acquisition and mergers of SEEBOARD Plc (formerly the South Eastern Electricity Board), London Electricity plc (formerly the London Electricity Board or LEB), SWEB Energy Plc (formerly the South Western Electricity Board) and two coal fired power stations and a combined cycle gas turbine power station. In 2009, EDF Energy took control of the nuclear generator in the United Kingdom, British Energy, buying share capital from the government. This made EDF Energy one of the largest generators in the United Kingdom, as well as the largest distribution network operator. The Development Branch of EDF Energy was formed in April 2004, bringing together the separate infrastructure interests of what were LE Group, SEEBOARD and SWEB. The focus for the Branch is development activity through the participation in major new infrastructure projects, largely in the public sector through Public-private partnership (PPP) and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) type schemes. The Development Branch of EDF Energy was later dissolved in October 2006. The electricity distribution (or downstream) networks formerly known as EDF Energy Networks were sold in November, 2010 to Hong Kong-based Cheung Kong Group (CKG), owned by billionaire Li Ka Shing. Later, EDF Energy Networks was renamed to UK Power Networks. In December 2014, EDF sold three small United Kingdom based wind farms with a combine capacity of 73 megawatts to the China General Nuclear Power Group for an estimated ¬£100 million. In November 2017, EDF Energy sold its majority stake in five wind farms across Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire for ¬£98 million. A release from EDF Energy confirmed that in 2018 the firm lost 200,000 as consumers shop around a highly competitive marketplace. EDF also found that earnings for its UK business had tumbled by 16.5% to ¬£691 million in the year to 31 December. No Dash For Gas action In February 2013, EDF Energy sought an estimated ¬£5 million in damages from environmental activists from the No Dash for Gas campaign, who occupied the EDF owned West Burton CCGT power station in October 2012, and pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated trespass. It is unusual in the United Kingdom for companies to seek damages from protesters. Environmentalist George Monbiot, writing in the Guardian, said EDF was conducting a strategic lawsuit against public participation, \\"part of a global strategy by corporations to stifle democracy\\", and predicted the \\"disastrous unintended consequences of an attempt at censorship\\" could result in the Streisand effect and be comparable to the McLibel case. The activists received support in the days since the case became public, with over six thousand signatures on a supportive petition at Change.org within the first day, and over 64,000 by the time EDF dropped their lawsuit on 13 March 2013, saying that this was \\"a fair and reasonable solution\\" after the protesters had \\"agreed in principle to accept a permanent injunction which prevents them from entering multiple sites operated by EDF Energy\\". Electricity generation =Fossil fuel= Cottam Power Station which closed in 2019 EDF owns and operates one 2,000 MW coal fired power station, West Burton Power Station, located near Retford in Nottinghamshire,‚Äì Department of Energy and Climate Change 'Digest of UK energy statistics' (DUKES) It also owns a 1,311 MW CCGT station at West Burton, which opened in 2011.West Burton Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Station, EDF Web Site =Wind= EDF owns and operates three wind farms, at Kirkheaton in Northumberland and the High Hedley Hope wind farm near Tow Law in County Durham, and the Teesside Offshore Wind near Redcar, Teesside. =Nuclear= Following the acquisition of British Energy in 2009, the EDF Energy portfolio includes eight nuclear power stations. They are seven AGR power stations (Dungeness B; Hinkley Point B; Hunterston B; Hartlepool; Heysham 1; Heysham 2 & Torness) and one PWR power station (Sizewell B), totalling nearly 9,000 MW of installed capacity. In 2007, EDF announced its intention to construct up to four new EPR reactors; two at Hinkley Point C (currently scheduled to start operation in 2025) and two at Sizewell C. EDF plans to build and operate the new plants through its subsidiary NNB Generation Company (NNB GenCo). In August 2014, the company announced it had shut down four of its 15 reactors for a period of eight weeks to investigate potential cracking in the boiler spine. In February 2016, EDF announced that it would keep four of its nuclear plants open in the United Kingdom. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool will have their life extended by five years until 2024, while Heysham 2 and Torness will see their closure dates pushed back by seven years to 2030. =Renewable energy= The Ecologist magazine reported that in 2004, EDF Energy spent virtually nothing on the construction of new renewable energy generation. On their website EDF reports that it is currently investing GBP 2 million in Marine Current Turbines, which use tidal power to generate electricity; however, these turbines are still at the research and prototype phase and EDF expect them to be operational \\"within the next five years\\" dependent upon \\"a successful pilot.\\" EDF also has several ongoing renewable developments in windfarms. In 2007, EDF had an installed renewable energy generating capacity of 1.8MW, representing 0.08% of their total capacity of approximately 4,865MW. In June 2008, EDF announced the formation of EDF Energy Renewables, a 50:50 joint venture with EDF Energies Nouvelles, with the stated intention of becoming a 'major force in the United Kingdom renewable energies market'. In July 2009, Ecotricity started legal proceedings against EDF Energy for the alleged misuse of the Green Union Flag logo, used to promote the Team Green Britain campaign. In April 2013, the 62 MW offshore Teesside Wind Farm started operation. Sponsorship EDF Energy London Eye EDF Energy has sponsored several shows on ITV, including Soapstar Superstar and City Lights. It also sponsored coverage of the 2006 World Cup in Germany (shared with Budweiser) and coverage of the 2007 Rugby World Cup (shared with Peugeot) Since 2005, EDF Energy has been the main sponsor of the EDF Energy Cup ‚Äì the Rugby Union domestic cup for the twelve clubs in the English Premiership and the four Welsh regions ‚Äì also known as the Anglo-Welsh Cup. In July 2007, EDF Energy was confirmed as another Level One sponsor for London 2012 with exclusive branding rights and Olympic team sponsorship for the 2008, 2010 and 2012 games as well as being the official energy provider. In August 2008, EDF Energy formed a partnership with The British Red Cross to help vulnerable people to get support during power failures. In January 2011, EDF Energy took over sponsorship from British Airways of the London Eye, on a three-year deal renaming the London Eye as the EDF Energy London Eye.EDF Energy website, accessed 7 August 2012 Marketing On 4 January 2008, EDF Energy began advertising on the television through ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and various Satellite channels. EDF Energy are using \\"It's not easy being green\\" as their slogan to target a new greener eco friendly image. In 2009, with Euro RSCG London, EDF Energy created the Team Green Britain campaign, in which Olympic athletes encouraged Britons to be more environmentally aware.

His most well known work was the Dake Annotated Reference Bible.  Christian conversion  Dake became a Christian at age 17. Dake claimed that upon his conversion he received a 'special anointing' which allowed him to quote major portions of Scripture from memory. He preached his first sermon in 1925 and was ordained by the Assemblies of God denomination two years later. After working as a pastor and evangelist in Texas and Oklahoma, he moved to Zion, Illinois, in order to become the pastor of the Christian Assembly Church. In Zion, he also founded Shiloh Bible Institute, which ultimately merged with Central Bible Institute and which was located in the home formerly owned by controversial faith healer John Alexander Dowie.  Conviction for \\"debauchery and other immoral practices\\"  In 1937, during Dake's ministry in Zion, he was convicted of violating the Mann Act by wilfully transporting 16-year-old Emma Barelli across the Wisconsin state line \\"for the purpose of debauchery and other immoral practices.\\" The May 27, 1936, issue of the Chicago Daily Tribune reported that Dake registered at hotels in Waukegan, Bloomington, and East St. Louis with the girl under the name \\"Christian Anderson and wife\\". With the possibility of a jury trial and subject to penalties of up to 10-year's imprisonment and a fine of US$10,000, Dake pleaded guilty, and served six months in the House of Corrections in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Finis Dake and His Six Month Sentence to Federal Prison Though he maintained his innocence of intent, his ordination with the Assemblies of God was revoked and he later joined the Church of God in Cleveland, Tennessee. He eventually became independent of any denomination; it is not known why he later ended his relationship with the Church of God.  Writings  The Dake Annotated Reference Bible (1963) was the first widely published study Bible produced by someone from within Pentecostalism. His annotated Authorized King James Version of the Bible took seven years to complete. The 35,000 notes in the Dake Bible are considered by Christian theologians to be personal, rather than Biblically-based, commentary. Along with Dake's annotated Bible, his other writings have caused controversy amongst theologians. His works include God's Plan for Man, Revelation Expounded, and Bible Truths Unmasked.  Death  Dake died of complications from Parkinson's disease on July 7, 1987.

It was founded in 1972 by Kontogouris brothers.  History  1965 Farmobil 700 The first efforts of the Kontogouris brothers involved attempts to build a light truck called Hellas in Germany. In 1957, they acquired rights to the production technology of a multi-purpose vehicle developed by Swiss engineer Dr. Wilfried Fahr. In 1961, Kontogouris (Gerasimos, Dimitrios, Leonidas, Petros, Victor-Georgios, and Konstantinos) created their first company (FARCO) in Thessaloniki, Greece, to produce the vehicle, called FARMOBIL, with BMW 700 flat-2 engine. Ironically, this smart vehicle was not certified for the Greek market and all production was exported to several countries around the world. In 1963, the company was acquired by Chrysler and renamed it Chrysler Hellas S.A. In 1967, production in Greece was stopped by the American company and was transferred to other countries. Meanwhile, in 1961 ambitious plans were made by the Kontogouris Brothers for a new company (to be called NAMCO) with a new factory in Patras, Greece to produce under licence a German-designed (Neckar) three-wheeler truck and other vehicles, but were not materialized. =NAMCO (1972)= NAMCO would resurface in 1972, when a light passenger-utility vehicle called the Pony was introduced in the Thessaloniki International Fair, after an agreement was signed with Citro√´n. The car, whose original design (Baby-Brousse) was created by a team of French engineers in C√¥te d'Ivoire on a 2CV platform, had been adopted by Citro√´n itself as part of \\"basic world car\\" project that eventually led to the Citro√´n FAF (the Pony and other similar cars preceded the FAF and were not derived from it, as is often erroneously reported). Indeed, cars on the same basis were produced around the world from Vietnam to Portugal, but the Pony became by far the most successful. In 1974, NAMCO started business officially and production started in a new plant in Thessaloniki. The Pony (also called Pony-Citro√´n), helped by a law giving tax breaks for light utility-passenger vehicles, became an instant success, being the cheapest car in the market and, at the same time, an incredibly robust and practical automobile; about half a dozen Greek companies would follow NAMCO's example, with similar contraptions, none of which, though, came close to Pony's success. The car was greatly modernized (including Dyane 6 components) and a large number of versions and facelifts followed, keeping it up to standards. A production number of 30,000 Pony's has often been cited, but it most probably included similar vehicles produced in other countries; a more accurate number of cars produced in Greece should be close to 17,000 units. Following its success in the Greek market, the company made significant exports to many countries around the world (a few were even exported to the U.S.), undoubtedly \\"helped\\" by the Citro√´n logo on the vehicle. NAMCO Pony- Citro√´n (1975 model) One of the last versions (1982 model) of the NAMCO Pony- Citro√´n, and one of the few that were sold in the U.S. NAMCO Milicar 6x6 (1978) Namco Pony Super (4-door, 1986 model) In 1978, NAMCO decided to move into other fields, introducing a series of very advanced 4x4 and 6x6 (3 to 6.5 tonne) multi-purpose trucks featuring a novel Swiss-designed, patented axle/suspension system. A complete lineup was made for many uses, consisting of the Agricar, Milicar, Pyrcar and Multi-trac vehicles. It is somewhat of a mystery why those advanced vehicles had limited success, with only small numbers ordered by Greek state authorities. Similarly, NAMCO designed a number of military vehicles including the Panther (of which only 2 were produced), as well as the Tiger and Aquilles armored vehicles and 4x4's, some of which did not even reach the stage of complete prototype. It has been argued that it was simply the wrong time, since the Greek state favored a state company (ELBO) for its supplies in that period. The first generation Pony (Pony-Citro√´n) was produced until 1983; in the meanwhile, the law concerning taxation of similar vehicles had been modified. Plans to manufacture other cars under license were not realized and for a moment it seemed that NAMCO would once more be out of business. But the company would bounce back, introducing a completely new model, the Pony Super, introduced in 1985. The second generation Pony had no connection with Citro√´n technology and was a much more modern car with Ford engines, coming in a number of versions (950 cc , 1100 cc , 1300 cc and 1600 cc diesel, in two- and four-door arrangements). It was essentially developed by NAMCO, since Inthelco, a German company also involved in its development, was majority-owned by NAMCO at the time. An ambitious plan was made to export the car to the U.S. with a 1900 cc engine via Inthelco as the Desta at a rate of 20,000 per year. However, the costs and prospects proved to be grossly miscalculated and the plan was abandoned. No matter how improved the new Pony was, it was still a far cry from the needs of the contemporary Greek market made of progressively more affluent and demanding consumers. Only a few hundred Pony Super's were built until 1992. Once more, though, the company created one more chance for rebirth, as its founders were stubbornly attached to the car-making business. So, although they also diversified into imports and trade of vehicles keeping NAMCO alive, they transformed the company into a technology exporter, offering design and construction of vehicle producing miniplants (as an antidote, they argued, to the giant conglomerates created by globalism) together with the Pony and their 4x4 truck technology. In 1994, the first Pony Supers produced under license in Bulgaria came out of the assembly plant in that country. NAMCO is still alive today, although a shadow of its former self. Production of the Pony Super and the trucks never \\"officially\\" ended, as the company maintains a factory able to resume production. Actually, a \\"third-generation\\" Pony (in reality a Pony Super with minor improvements) was introduced in 2003 but never produced. Company focus, nonetheless, as was the case with many similar Greek companies, has decisively shifted towards trade and services.  New era  The company has announced plans to restart production in 2015, introducing a \\"new generation Pony\\". The new Pony will be powered either by a PCM (Peugeot-Citroen Moteurs) or FIAT (1360 cc) engine, while retains the lines of the old Pony, and because it is a new era car the interior will feature a USB hub. According to the company, several countries in Asia, Africa, and South America have expressed interest in license production of the new model. It will cost about 7.000‚Ç¨.

The meat has a specific taste and can be preserved in the course of several years, owing much to the special process of making and the climatic conditions of the part of Stara Planina where Elena is located. Preparation The legs and quarters of the pig, traditionally singed and scraped, are taken from the body. Later the redundant parts are removed, so that the remaining meat is protected by hide or the skin that surrounds the muscle tissue. After the legs are shaped, they are well salted and put at the bottom of a postav, a special type of barrel designed for the occasion. The delicacy traditionally remains in salt for 40 days, then is taken out and left to dry. =Preservation technologies= There are various preservation technologies used to prepare elenski but these typically vary considerably from family to family, as opposed to regionally. In the past, the rounds were put in well trampled upon maize meal or processed with lime milk. The meat could also be stored in specially sewn bags of cheesecloth or wooden containers with thick nets instead of walls (muharnik), but as a rule were placed somewhere airy, where the clear mountain air could aid the drying and conservation, and also in order to prevent houseflies laying eggs on the rounds. In many of the small towns around Elena, the rounds were in the past left in conservation in the rooms where the daily house fire was lit, so that a certain amount of smoking could be achieved in order to add smoked flavour.

A new cladistic analysis performed by Thompson et al., 2011 suggests that Mymoorapelta is a basal nodosaurid. To date, only a single species has been named for this taxon, M. maysi.

County career Tunnicliffe was born at Low Town, Pudsey, Yorkshire, England. He was a tall, forceful right-handed opening batsman, and on his figures one of the best slip fielders of all time. A late starter in first- class cricket, he was a regular in the Yorkshire team from 1893 and, between 1895 and 1907, scored 1,000 runs in every season except 1903. His best year was 1898, when he scored 1,804 runs at an average of 41.00 runs per innings. That season he made his highest score, contributing 243 in a then-record partnership for any wicket of 554 with Jack Brown against Derbyshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield. That stand is still the third highest for the first wicket, and the sixth highest for any wicket, in first-class cricket worldwide. Tunnicliffe was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1901. Almost as important to Yorkshire as his batting was Tunnicliffe's slip fielding. Nicknamed \\"Long John of Pudsey\\", he had long arms that enabled him to bring off catches others would not have attempted. In 498 first-class matches, he took 695 catches. In a few of his early games in 1891 and 1892, he appeared to have acted as wicket-keeper, but thereafter he was at slip. His 70 catches in the 1901 season was a record that stood until Wally Hammond caught 79 in 1928. His ratio of catches to matches is 1.393:1, which compares favourably with both Hammond (1.291:1) and John Langridge (1.365:1). Tunnicliffe scored 20,310 first-class runs at an average of 27.00, and with his occasional bowling took seven wickets at 57.85. Retirement and death Tunnicliffe retired after the 1907 season, and became cricket coach at Clifton College. He later served on the Gloucestershire County Cricket Club committee when his son was the county secretary. He died in Westbury Park, Bristol in July 1948, aged 81.

Family Background Alberto was born in the barrio of Almagro, Buenos Aires, under the name of Felipe Alberto Milletari Miagro; the son of Piedmontese immigrants, his father Don Milletari was arriving from Italy when he met the daughter of another piemontes family the Miagro, whom were living in the C√≥rdoba Province of Argentina after arriving from Italy via Brazil. His upbringing was enriched by the entrepreneurial spirit of his father and the intellectual influence of her mother a dedicated reader of history and philosophy. By the time he entered the professional world of writers and TV production industry, Alberto was advised by his colleagues and mentors to change his name, a common dynamic in the industry, as such after consulting and researching names he decided to create a combination name based on his second name Albereto and a variation of his mother's surname Miagro in Jud√¶o-Piedmontese language, and his pseudonym \\"Alberto Migr√©\\" was born; giving him the seal to a successful career. TV career Migr√© started off working in radio stations, with the idea of eventually becoming an actor, although he himself acknowledged that his voice was not good for the microphone. He wrote some scripts for a children's programme and ended up in charge of sound in a radionovela starring Chela Ruiz and Horacio Delfino. He was commended by Ruiz and put in charge of writing some major programmes, such as Revista juvenil argentina (1948). Then he moved on to television. Starting in 1972, Migr√© created major hits, such as Rolando Rivas, taxista, Piel Naranja and Pobre diabla. He also contributed with some Brazilian series. In 1974 he wrote the script for the cinema version of Rolando Rivas, taxista. During the 1990s Migr√© was practically forgotten by the TV industry. Migr√© often criticized the new ways of writing TV fiction, especially the over-long series of episodes driven by good ratings and other economical factors alone: \\"In the 60s, telenovelas lasted 22 half-hour episodes; it was a delight, you had a plan, developed the story with a rhythm and precise guidelines and then you went on to think of another story.\\" He was also a vindicator of the role of the creative screenwriter: \\"Current TV is not for me, since it is not what I was taught: I learned that the author was the foundation upon which the whole project was built. Now the author has lost importance and has been replaced by a team of writers in charge of a coordinator.\\" Migr√© never married, and lived with his parents until their death. He died while sleeping, victim of a heart attack, at the age of 75. He was the incumbent president of Argentores, the Argentine scriptwriter's guild. By an explicit request made in advance, he did not have a funeral service.

Al-Qaeda in Iraq‚Äîpart of the Mujahideen Shura Council‚Äîwas in September 2006 believed by the United States to be \\"the most significant political force\\" in the Iraqi Al Anbar province. In mid-October 2006, a statement was released, stating that the Mujahideen Shura Council had been disbanded, and was replaced by the Islamic State of Iraq.  Formation and names  On 15 January 2006, in a statement posted to the jihadist website Hanin Net, 'al-Qaeda in Iraq' (AQI, Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al- Rafidayn) spokesman Abu Maysarah al-Iraqi announced the formation of the \\"Mujahideen Consultative Council\\" (\\"Majlis Shura al-Mujahideen fi al-Iraq\\"). It was formed to resist efforts by the American and Iraqi authorities to win over Sunni supporters of the insurgency. The stated purpose of the council was \\"Managing the struggle in the battle of confrontation to ward off the invading kafir (infidels) and their apostate stooges. ... Uniting the word of the mujahideen and closing their ranks...[and] determining a clear position toward developments and incidents so that people can see things clearly and the truth will not be confused with falsehood.\\" It united AQI with five other insurgent groups opposed to U.S. and coalition and Iraqi forces. The groups were: * al- Qaeda in Iraq * Jaish al-Ta'ifa al-Mansurah * Katbiyan Ansar al-Tawhid wal Sunnah * Saray al-Jihad Group * al-Ghuraba Brigades * al-Ahwal Brigades AQI continued to claim responsibility for attacks through the new council. Other sources called the council Mujahideen Shura Council in Iraq or Mujaheddin Consultative Council. On or before 25 April 2006, a videotape of Abu Musab al- Zarqawi was released bearing the organization's logo.  Structure  Little is known about the organizational structure of the Council, in large part due to the shadowy nature of the organization itself. al Qaeda in Iraq was the most powerful and visible group. Because of the multiple leaders the Shura Council had, there seems to have been no disruption in the Shura Council's ability to carry out attacks: more than 1,600 Iraqi civilians died in the month right after Zarqawi's death, the largest number killed in a month to that date. Elements of the Shura Council's organization from the top to the bottom remain fluid due both to the nature of its aims and methods as well as its loose confederation. It was speculated that the group was dominated by al Qaeda in Iraq and that Zarqawi's death dealt a severe blow to the unity of the Council. Aside from the murky workings of the Shura Council's leadership it is known that the Council has rather smooth operations when it comes to propaganda, the Council's propaganda czar, Murasel, regularly posted updates, criticisms, and praises for the Council's own acts of violence on a semi-daily basis at blogspot.com.  Activities   MSC forms \\"Mutayibeen Coalition\\"  MSC, including AQI, on 12 October 2006 announced their \\"Mutayibeen Coalition\\" consisting of MSC, three smaller insurgent groups, and six 'loyal' Anbar Sunni tribes counting 300,000 members. A video on Internet showed six white-clad, masked men, representing: the Shura Council of the Jihad Fighters in Iraq (or Mujahideen Shura Council in Iraq); Jaysh Al-Fatihin (\\"The Army of the Conquerors\\"); Jund Al-Sahaba (\\"The Army of the Companions\\"); Kataib Ansar Al- Tawhid wal-Sunna (\\"The Monotheism and Sunna Brigades\\"); and \\"many of the sheikhs of the faithful tribes (in Iraq)\\"; taking an Arab \\"oath of the scented ones\\" (hilf al-mutayyabin). They announced: \\"to implement God's sharia, ‚Ä¶ We swear by God/Allah to do our utmost to free the prisoners of their shackles, and to rid Sunnis from the oppression of the rejectionists (Shi'ite Muslims) and the crusader occupiers, to assist the oppressed and restore rights even at the price of our own lives‚Ä¶ to make Allah's word supreme in the world, and to restore the glory of Islam\\".  MSC becomes part of 'Islamic State of Iraq'  On 13 and 15 October 2006, messages on Internet purportedly in the name of MSC and the Mutayibeen Coalition declared the establishment of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) which should encompass the governorates of Baghdad, Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Saladin, Nineveh and parts of Babil and Wasit ‚Äì a swathe of central and western Iraq where most Sunni Arabs live.Stephen Negus: \\"Call for Sunni state in Iraq\\". Financial Times, 2006-10-15. Retrieved 15 January 2015. (Free) registration required. Abu Omar al-Baghdadi was being announced as the self-proclaimed state's Emir. A Mujahideen Shura Council leader said: \\"God willing we will set the law of Sharia here and we will fight the Americans\\". The Council urged on Sunni Muslim tribal leaders to join their separate Islamic state \\"to protect our religion and our people, to prevent strife and so that the blood and sacrifices of your martyrs are not lost\\". In reality, the group was not known to control any territory in Iraq yet. Following the announcement, scores of gunmen took part in military parades in Ramadi and other Anbar towns to celebrate. In November, a statement was issued by Abu Ayyub al-Masri, leader of Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC), announcing the disbanding of the MSC, in favor of the ISI. After this statement, there were a few more claims of responsibility issued under the name of the Mujahideen Shura Council, but these eventually ceased and were totally replaced by claims from the Islamic State of Iraq.

Its models include both fishing and cruising yachts ranging from 34‚Äì53 feet. The company is most famous for coining the term \\"open\\" to describe its Tiara 3100. Tiara had a sister company, known as Pursuit, that produces models from 24‚Äì42 feet with outboard engines. Pursuit Boats was acquired by Malibu Boats in 2018.https://www.pursuitboats.com/History.php History of company Tiara Yachts is known for building mid-sized luxury yachts.http://jointarchives.org/quarter/fall05.pdf The company‚Äôs founder, Leon Slikkers, owned and operated another yacht building company before he founded his second company, S2 Yachts (parent company to Tiara). Even before that, Slikkers worked at Chris Craft. Slikkers' next move in his career was owning and operating Slickcraft, which focused on building motor-powered boats. In the late 1960s, many large public yacht companies were looking to buy smaller companies in the interest of drawing new stockholders and diversifying their stock. A company based in New York, called American Machine and Foundry (AMF), gained interest in Slickcraft. In September 1969, Slikkers sold the company, while still holding his position as President. After a few years with this new company, Slikkers left claiming that they were not committed to the same level of excellence as he was. Slikkers then proceeded to leave AMF and Slickcraft behind to create a new company with his sons, which his family stills owns and operates today, S2 Yachts and all of its ‚Äòchild‚Äô companies such as Tiara Yachts. On February 18, 1974, S2 Yachts was founded. Shortly after S2 Yachts was founded, Slikkers‚Äô two older sons finished college and joined their father at the company. S2 began rolling sailboats off the lot almost right away, however, a few more years down the line Leon began to feel the same pressures as before. Fortunately for him, he had a larger company this time, more capital than before, and both his sons on his side. All these factors allowed S2 to gain momentum in this ever-competitive industry, still able to remain a private company. In 1976, Leon decided that it was time for another change of pace within the company. These changes lead to S2 Yachts building motor yachts. As a result of the high sales of this new line of yachts, it was decided to create a totally new division in the company that would focus on motor yachts only. Tiara Yachts was incorporated. Tiara Yachts are manufactured in Tiara‚Äôs Holland Michigan plant. Tiara previously had a manufacturing plant in South Carolina but this was closed during the 2008/2009 US economic downturn and all manufacturing was returned to Holland Michigan. Tiara Yachts also manufactures the some of larger Pursuit Boat models for Pursuit boats. Yachts offered by Tiara Tiara Yachts currently offers five series of yachts, the Q Series, Tiara Series, Convertible Series, Flybridge Series, and the Coupe Series. Previously, Tiara Yachts made the Sport, Open, Coronet, Express, Convertible and Sovran series.

He became the acting governor for the two colonies from May 1709 to April 1710.  Life  Ingoldesby served the Prince of Orange during the Glorious Revolution as a field officer. He played a role in the Irish campaign by besieging the Jacobite stronghold at Carrickfergus. Ingoldesby, in September 1690, became a captain of a company being sent to New York to restore the royal crown following Leisler's Rebellion. Ingoldesby did this by removing Jacob Leisler from his assumed position as lieutenant governor of New York, and forced Leisler to surrender New York City. Following a brief skirmish in March 1691, Leisler was tried and convicted for both murder and treason, and was hanged that May on orders from Governor Henry Sloughter. This provoked some distaste by the pro-Leislerian followers. The New York Council proceeded to select Ingoldesby as the commander-in-chief of the colony until a successor for Sloughter, who died not long after the Leisler trial, could be appointed. Ingoldesby then held the position of governor from the summer of 1961 until August 1692, when Benjamin Fletcher was commissioned. Ingoldesby entered into a formal treaty of alliance and friendship with the Iroquois on June 6th, 1692, in the midst of a conflict known as King William's War. Fletcher was dispatched to a company in Albany, New York, but low payment and supplies prompted him to return to England in 1696 for seven years (instead of his one- year furlough). Through political intrigue, he attempted to get promoted, and was acquainted with William Dockwra, one of several East Jersey proprietors. Ingoldesby was backed by Dockwra to become the first royal governor of New Jersey, but Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury became governor instead and Ingoldesby became the lieutenant. Cornbury refused to grant any power to Ingoldesby at all during his period of governorship. Instead, Ingoldesby became part of the New Jersey Provincial Council. Following the death of John Lovelace on 6 May 1709, he became the acting governor of both New Jersey and New York. However, due to the efforts of the proprietors that he opposed, Ingoldesby's governorship became an object of suspicion. In part of the Glorious Enterprise, a joint invasion of Canada by American and British forces, Ingoldesby urged the Assembly to raise New Jersey's quota of 200 men, a move which was unpopular with the Assembly's Quaker minority. However, he later twisted his role and tried to remove the Quakers from holding office positions by defeating the bill, whereupon he ordered that all Quakers were excluded from all public offices. Ultimately, he was persuaded to raise and equip the men, but since the British failed to provide any support, the mission was unsuccessful. Realizing that he would never become the appointed governor of New Jersey, Ingoldesby instead tried to divert much of the money that was to go to Lovelace to himself. His commission for governorship was revoked by October 1709, but the news only reached him in April 1710. He died in New York on 1 March 1719.

A highly regarded rover, Eason played most of his football for the Geelong Football Club, playing a total of 150 games for the club between 1909 and 1921. His time at Geelong was broken up by World War I: upon Geelong's withdrawal from the league in 1916, he crossed to Richmond and played twelve games there, before enlisting and serving in the war for the next two years. He returned to play for Geelong from 1919 until 1921, earning selection for Victoria in interstate football during that time. In 1922, Eason crossed to Footscray in the VFA without a clearance, and played there until 1924, continuing to earn high acclaim and winning two premierships; he received ¬£12 per week at Footscray, with the Sporting Globe reporting that he was the highest paid footballer at that time. In 1925, when Footscray joined the VFL, Eason was unable to remain with the club due to his suspension from the VFL for leaving Geelong without a clearance, and he crossed to Brighton for the final year of his senior career. Eason was a talented and hard-working player, nicknamed \\"Bunny\\" because of his speed. His accuracy with both kicking (particularly stab-kicking) and handpassing were highly regarded, as was his ability to win the ball from either his or his opponents' ruck tap-outs, and he was considered one of the finest rovers in Victoria in the early 1920s. He had two fingers on his right hand missing, but this did not greatly affect his skill. He is a member of Geelong's Hall of Fame and was named on the interchange bench of the club's Team of the Century. His brother Bill Eason also played for Geelong, and served as captain for four years. He later coached Footscray in the VFL for the 1929 season and Prahran in the latter part of the 1933 season. He became an administrator at Footscray, serving as chairman of selectors. He was well-regarded for his on-field and off-field wit, and wrote columns for the Sporting Globe. Eason is buried at the Footscray Cemetery.

Naqada III is the last phase of the Naqada culture of ancient Egyptian prehistory, dating from approximately 3200 to 3000 BC. It is the period during which the process of state formation, which began in Naqada II, became highly visible, with named kings heading powerful polities. Naqada III is often referred to as Dynasty 0 or the Protodynastic Period to reflect the presence of kings at the head of influential states, although, in fact, the kings involved would not have been a part of a dynasty. In this period, those kings' names were inscribed in the form of serekhs on a variety of surfaces including pottery and tombs. History The Protodynastic Period in ancient Egypt was characterised by an ongoing process of political unification, culminating in the formation of a single state to begin the Early Dynastic Period. Furthermore, it is during this time that the Egyptian language was first recorded in hieroglyphs. There is also strong archaeological evidence of Egyptian settlements in southern Canaan during the Protodynastic Period, which are regarded as colonies or trading entrep√¥ts. State formation began during this era and perhaps even earlier. Various small city-states arose along the Nile. Centuries of conquest then reduced Upper Egypt to three major states: Thinis, Naqada, and Nekhen. Sandwiched between Thinis and Nekhen, Naqada was the first to fall. Thinis then conquered Lower Egypt. Nekhen's relationship with Thinis is uncertain, but these two states may have merged peacefully, with the Thinite royal family ruling all of Egypt. The Thinite kings were buried at Abydos in the Umm el-Qa'ab cemetery. Most Egyptologists consider Narmer to be both the last king of this period and the first king of the First Dynasty. He was possibly preceded over some parts of Upper Egypt by Crocodile, Iry-Hor, Ka, and perhaps by the king Scorpion, whose name may refer to, or be derived from, the goddess Serket, a special early protector of other deities and the rulers. Naqada III extended all over Egypt and was characterized by some notable firsts: *The first hieroglyphs *The first graphical narratives on palettes *The first regular use of serekhs *The first truly royal cemeteries *Possibly the first example of irrigation And at best, a notable second: *The invention of sail navigationMeza, A.I.

The few non-Japanese companies that have managed to survive in the market include Adept Technology, St√§ubli-Unimation, the Swedish-Swiss company ABB (ASEA Brown-Boveri), the Austrian manufacturer igm Robotersysteme AG and the German company KUKA Robotics. This includes the assembly line robots used by the robot-based automative production plants. Characteristics The recently created CB¬≤ (child robot with biomimetic body) can follow moving objects with its eyes. CB¬≤ may recognize the human touch, which is possible thanks to the 197 film-like pressure sensors that are placed under its rubber skin. Asada, the team of engineers, brain specialists, psychologists and other specialists in the related fields, created CB¬≤ so that it records emotional expressions, memorizes them and then matches them with physical sensations. The characteristics of the robot are progressive, its abilities improving as technology improves. CB¬≤ acts increasingly human with time: it was capable of teaching itself how to walk with the aid of human help. The robot learned how to move around the room by using its 51 \\"muscles,\\" which are driven by air pressure. The characteristics of the humanoid Japanese robots include abilities such as blinking, smiling or expressing emotions such as anger and surprise. One of the newer Japanese robots, HRP-4C, is a female robot programmed to catwalk. It walks, talks and, with the help of 30 motors, can move its legs and arms. Its facial expressions are driven by 8 facial motors: it can smile, blink, pout and express anger or surprise. Robots that are intended to play with children usually look like animals and can make different sounds, move, walk and play. Robot dogs, for example, can bark, move their tail, run or play with a child. There are also robots that can be mounted and used for transport. Some of these move by rolling. =Mobility and movement= One of the characteristics and competitive advantages of Japanese robotics is the superior movement and mobility of the robots.  Commercial applications  Conceivable commercial applications of robots include any type of activity that a robot could do in the domestic or industrial field. Researchers across Japan have unveiled increasingly sophisticated robots with different functions, including a talking office receptionist, a security guard and even a primary school teacher. The newest model of domestic helper, AppriAttenda, was developed by Toshiba. This is a robot that can fetch containers from a refrigerator by using its two arms; it moves on wheels. The purpose of the robot is to assist elderly people living alone. The robots could help them with basic tasks inside the house. Fumio Miyazaki, an engineering science professor at the Toyonaka Campus of Osaka University, has stated that Japanese scientists could potentially provide thousands of humanoids that could be working alongside humans by the end of the 2020s. Japan has the highest number of industrial robots in the world. Over a quarter of a million robots are employed in an effort to reduce the high labor costs and support further industrial mechanization. Japan wants robotics in the 21st century to be what automobiles were in the 20th century. Robots are also seen as a solution to Japan's declining birth rate and shrinking workforce, which is an important issue in Japanese society. Although the number of workers that a robot could replace varies on the type of industry, a robot may do the job for several workers and can provide an answer to the nation's declining workforce. This is expected to weigh heavily on future pension and health-care programs. History Among Japan's oldest robot precursors are the karakuri ningyo, or mechanical dolls. During the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867), Takeda-za developed a mechanical-puppet theater that flourished in Osaka's D≈çtonbori district. The Japanese craftsman Hisashige Tanaka, known as \\"Japan's Edison,\\" created an array of extremely complex mechanical toys, some of which were capable of serving tea, firing arrows drawn from a quiver, or even painting a Japanese kanji character. The landmark text Karakuri Zui (Illustrated Machinery) was published in 1796. In 1928, the Gakutensoku robot was designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura. A popular fictional robot was the cartoon character Astroboy, or Tetsuwan Atomu in Japan. Astroboy was created by Osamu Tezuka. In the mid-20th century, professor Ichiro Kato of Waseda University studied humanoid robots. He initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale humanoid intelligent robot. WABOT-1 had two arms, walked on two legs, and saw with two camera eyes.http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html It was thus the first android. Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and carry objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. Its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.Robots: From Science Fiction to Technological Revolution, page 130Handbook of Digital Human Modeling: Research for Applied Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering, Chapter 3, pages 1-2 Japan has since been leading the field of robotics.Robotics and Mechatronics: Proceedings of the 4th IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics, page 66 The Japanese company Kawasaki Robotics started the commercial production of industrial robots over 40 years ago. Approximately 700,000 industrial robots were used all over the world in 1995, of which 500,000 operated in Japan. In 1996, Honda announced the P2 humanoid robot, which was an incentive for a number of companies and institutes to develop humanoid robots for various purposes. In 2012, between 1,235,000 and 1,500,000 industrial robots were in use.

He is the founder of Cogent Systems in 1990. In 2011, he founded Fulgent Genetics, a genetic testing technology company that provides comprehensive genetic testing solutions. According to Forbes magazine, his estimated net worth exceeds $1.6 billion, ranking him the 198th richest person in America and 562nd among The World's Richest People In 2006. Early life Ming Hsieh was born in 1956. His parents were Baoyan and Sun Hsieh. His family originated in Guangzhou (Canton). Hsieh was raised in Shenyang, the capital city of Liaoning province in Northeast China. His family was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution as a part of China's upper middle class having ties with the old national government and moved to Taiwan (Yingzhou, Ming's grandfather, was a high-ranking official of Republic of China). As a result, his family was forced to move in 1966 to a small village near Panjin. At the age of 10, Hsieh's formal education stopped for the next ten years. During that period, Hsieh learned the trade of electrical engineering from his formally trained father as they built a crude power system for the village they were assigned to and did odd repair work. Hsieh's uncle, P.Y. Hsieh, had left China and earned a Master of Science in mechanical engineering from the University of Southern California in 1952 before working for TRW. Knowing of this, Hsieh decided to follow his uncle and, after two years at the South China Institute of Technology in Guangzhou and with an inheritance from his grandparents in Taiwan, he transferred to USC's engineering program at age 24. Hsieh earned his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from USC in 1983 and MSEE in 1984. His parents wanted him to continue and earn a Ph.D., but Hsieh decided to first work a few years. Career Hsieh began work as a circuit designer for International Rectifier. After two and a half years, he decided to start his own business. He founded Cogent Systems Inc. which offered fully automated, high-speed biometric fingerprint system. The company began receiving numerous government contracts and now includes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Prisons, FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police amongst its customers. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2015. Philanthropy In October 2006, Hsieh donated $35 million to USC's Viterbi School of Engineering's Department of Electrical Engineering, 100 years after the department and school's founding. In honor of his donation, the department was renamed the USC Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering. In October 2010, Hsieh donated $50 million to USC for cancer research. He is on the USC Board of Trustees.Board of Trustees , University of Southern California, Accessed April 13, 2008.

It is the largest urban area in the United Kingdom with a population of 9,787,426 in 2011. Overview Population density map Satellite view of the inner parts of the Greater London Built-up Area. The Greater London Built-up or Urban Area had a population of 9,787,426 and occupied an area of at the time of the 2011 census. It includes most of the London region ‚Äì omitting most of its woodland; small, buffered districts; the Lee Valley Park; and the two largest sewage treatment works serving London by the River Thames. Outside the region's administrative boundary, it includes contiguous suburban settlements and a few densely populated outliers connected to it by ribbon development. Its outer boundary is constrained by the Metropolitan Green Belt and it is therefore much smaller than the wider metropolitan area of London. As a selective grouping of relatively low- to mid-density (and some high-density) output areas, each consisting of roughly 120 households,Guidance and Methodology Office for National Statistics. Retrieved 31 October 2013 it can be compared to the London region, which covers and contained 8,173,194 residents at the time of the 2011 census. The built-up area of the Greater London region continues beyond the region's administrative boundary in some places, while stopping short of it in others. For this reason, the density of the Greater London Built-Up Area is 8.3% higher than that of Greater London, the figure for which includes these outlying rural areas (notably in Hillingdon, Enfield, Havering and Bromley). All of both areas is drained ultimately by the River Thames. The area uses around 4 gigawatts of electricity power. History The density gradient of industrialising cities has tended to follow a specific pattern: the density of the centre of the city would rise during urbanisation and the population would remain heavily concentrated in the city centre with a rapid decline in settlement towards the periphery. Then, with continued economic growth and the expanding networks of public transport, people (particularly the middle-class) would then slowly migrate towards the suburbs, gradually softening the population density gradient. This point was generally reached when the city reached a certain stage of economic development. In London, this point was reached in the first half of the nineteenth century, in Paris toward the end of the century and in New York City at the turn of the twentieth. However, London had been sprawling out of its medieval confines within the City since the eighteenth century, when the city experienced its first great urban surge. Areas to the west of Westminster were increasingly built up for the wealthy, to live in the suburbs of the city. The cover of the alt=A painting of a half- timbered house set behind a drive and flower garden. Below the painting the title \\"METRO-LAND\\" is in capitals and in smaller text is the price of two- pence. A dramatic increase in the city's urban sprawl began in the nineteenth century, when labourers flocked from the countryside to work in the new factories that were then springing up. Large developments of small terraced houses began to appear and the new public transport systems ‚Äì (the metro, buses and trams) ‚Äì allowed workers to commute into the city daily. Suburban districts also sprung up around the city centre to accommodate those who wanted to escape the squalid conditions of the industrial town. By the mid- nineteenth century, the first major suburban areas were springing up around London as the city (then the largest in the world) became more overcrowded and unsanitary. A major catalyst in the growth in urban sprawl came from the opening of the Metropolitan Railway in the 1860s. The line joined the capital's financial heart in the City to what were to become the suburbs of Middlesex. Harrow was reached in 1880, and the line eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street and the centre of London. Unlike other railway companies, which were required to dispose of surplus land, the Met was allowed to retain such land that it believed was necessary for future railway use. Initially, the surplus land was managed by the Land Committee, and, from the 1880s, the land was developed and sold to domestic buyers in places like Willesden Park Estate, Cecil Park, near Pinner and at Wembley Park. In 1919, with the expectation of a post-war housing boom, Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited was formed and went on to develop estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth and create places such as Harrow Garden Village. By the early-twentieth century, amid increasing middle-class affluence, large low-density suburbs of semi-detached houses had sprung up all around the city, doubling the area of built-up London in the interwar period alone, despite the population increase being just 10%. H.G Wells even predicted in 1902 that within a hundred years most of southern England would have been subsumed into one gigantic conurbation centred in London. 2011 Census subdivisions At the time of the 2011 Census, the Office for National Statistics defined the Greater London Urban Area as being made up of the following components:. =London region= The London region consists of 33 districts: the City of London, the 12 Inner London boroughs (including the City of Westminster), and the 20 Outer London boroughs. * Barking and Dagenham * Barnet * BexleyIncludes the town of Dartford * Brent * Bromley * Camden * City of London * City of Westminster * Croydon * Ealing * Enfield * Greenwich * Hackney * Hammersmith and Fulham * Haringey * Harrow * Havering * Hillingdon * Hounslow * Islington * Kensington and Chelsea * Kingston upon Thames * Lambeth * Lewisham * Merton * Newham * Redbridge * Richmond upon Thames * Southwark * Sutton * Tower Hamlets * Waltham Forest * Wandsworth =Surrey= * Addlestone * Ashford * Ashtead * Banstead * Bramley * Brookwood * Broomhall/Windlesham/Virginia Water * Caterham * Chertsey * Chobham * Claygate * Cobham Surrey * Effingham * Egham * Epsom * Esher * Ewell * Guildford * Hooley * Leatherhead * Lyne * Mimbridge * Netherne-on-the- Hill * Ottershaw * Pirbright * Pirbright Camp * SheppertonIncluded under Walton-on-Thames subdivision * Staines-upon-Thames * Sunbury * Walton-on- Thames * Warlingham * Weybridge * Woking * Worplesdon =Hertfordshire= * Bedmond * Borehamwood * Bushey * Cheshunt * Chorleywood * Elstree * Hemel Hempstead * Hoddesdon * How Wood * Northwood * Park Street * Rickmansworth * Sawbridgeworth * Smallford * St Albans * St Margarets * Waltham Cross * Watford =Berkshire= * Binfield * Bracknell * Cheapside * North Ascot * Slough * Winkfield Street * Woodside * Wraysbury =Essex= * Broadley Common * Chigwell * Harlow * Loughton * Stapleford Abbots * Waltham Abbey =Kent= * Dartford * Gravesend * Greenhithe * Maypole * Northfleet * Stone * Swanscombe Omitted areas In the 2011 census, the following areas were considered to be built-up areas but outside the Greater London Built-up Area, although they are still within Greater London.

History  Founded in the 5th century BC, at the time it was known as Uscosium or Usconium and together with Pescara, Ortona, Lanciano, Vasto and Larino, it was one of the most important centers of the Frentani, an Italic people that was part of the Samnites confederations. Thanks to its strategic position along the Via Frentana- Traiana, Usconium became, towards the end of the Republican Era, a municipium, reaching a population of some 25,000 inhabitants. Usconium was located between Monte Antico and Monte Capraro, where Guglionesi is now found. Its inhabitants depended on the nearby Pagus Collis Nisii or Collenisyus (\\"Hill of Bacchus\\"), a hill fort in which they sheltered after the town's destruction by the Goths. In 412 AD, Colleniso became New Usconium and was encircled by protective walls in the Longobardo period. After that, the most important fortification was raised in the 9th century, when Robert Guiscard took hold of the city. In that period eighteen watchtowers and two castles were erected. The first castle (named \\"of head\\" because it was in a higher position than the others, subsequently called \\"of foot\\") was located along Via Capitano Verri, where its ruins can still be seen today. The second castle is in Castellara. After the destruction of the second castle, the Convent of the Cappuccini was constructed upon what was left of the castle foundations. In t801 AD, Colleniso was submitted to the Duke of Spoleto, and endured various incursions by Saracen raiders. In the 1137 AD. it endured pillage from Lotarius, emperor of the Roman Empire. In 1315 King Robert of Anjou gave Collenisio to his brother Peter, Count of Gravina, and at his death, his daughter Agnese inherited the city. In 1340 she founded the Certosa of Saint Giovanni Battista, also known as Porta del Paradiso (The Heaven‚Äôs door) where the Hermitage of Saint John is now found. During this time the city was repeatedly invaded; its name was also changed from Colleniso to Guillonisi. In 1496, after the death of Ren√© of Anjou, his cousin Charles VIII of France descended to Italy with a large army and conquered Naples. The French entered Guillonisi (only by the betrayal of the guards of the Frentan door) and plundered the entire village, demolished the two castles and the towers and killed or raped most of the people. Another invasion occurred in the 16th century by the Turks, who set fire, among other things, to the church of Saint Maria Maggiore, and consequently the relics of St. Adam housed in the church were destroyed and lost.  Transportation  Guglionesi was served by a railway station, the Guglionesi-Portocannone railway station on the Termoli-Campobasso and Termoli‚ÄìVenafro line, but the station has been closed for a few years and does not have passenger service.

The museum houses mosaics from the Byzantine period, unearthed at the site of the Great Palace of Constantinople. History The museum hosts the mosaics used to decorate the pavement of a peristyle court, dating possibly to the reign of Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565), although more recent analysis hints at a later date, possibly even the reign of Heraclius. It was uncovered by British archaeologists from the University of St Andrews in Scotland during extensive excavations at the Arasta Bazaar in Sultan Ahmet Square in 1935‚Äì1938 and 1951‚Äì1954. The area formed part of the south-western Great Palace, and the excavations discovered a large peristyle courtyard, with a surface of 1872 m¬≤, entirely decorated with mosaics.

Clarke's five campuses serve more than 1,000 students annually in Northampton, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Jacksonville. Clarke is the oldest and largest school of its kind in the U.S.  Introduction  Clarke School for the Deaf was founded in 1867 in Northampton, Massachusetts, as the first permanent oral school for the deaf in the United States, and it has gained an international reputation as a pioneer and a leader in the field of listening and spoken language. A local benefactor, John Clarke, offered a $50,000 grant to anyone who would start a school for the deaf in Northampton. Gardiner Greene Hubbard, with the state government and numerous individuals, played a role in the founding of Clarke. Clarke was not only the first school to teach children with hearing loss to speak in the United States, but also the first to initiate education in the early years and the first to recognize the importance of students entering mainstream classrooms. Clarke was the first to train teachers in auditory/oral education and in 1962 enhanced its teacher education program by partnering with Smith College, where graduates can earn a Masters of Education of the Deaf. As of 2008, over 1,400 teachers of the deaf had been trained through the Smith College/Clarke Graduate Teacher Education program. Alexander Graham Bell, President Calvin Coolidge, and First Lady Grace Coolidge served on Clarke‚Äôs Board of Trustees, with Bell and Grace Coolidge serving as chair of the board at different times. In the first quarter of 2010, Clarke announced the new name better reflecting their mission from Clarke School for the Deaf to Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech. Subsequently, a new logo and website were created to complete the rebranding In the present day, the Clarke School has campuses not only in Northampton, but at: * Clarke's Boston campus in Canton, Massachusetts * Clarke's Pennsylvania campus (Clarke Pennsylvania) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania * Clarke's New York campus (Clarke New York) in New York City, New York * Clarke's Jacksonville campus (Clarke Jacksonville) in Jacksonville, Florida  Clarke's Summer Camp  Clarke's Summer Camp (formally called \\"Clarke's Summer Adventure\\") is a two-week, theme-based camp for children ages 9 to 17 with hearing loss who utilize hearing technology (such as hearing aids or cochlear implants) and communicate using listening and spoken language. Activities are led by experienced teachers of the deaf and young adults with hearing loss, and encourage leadership and independence, while enhancing listening, communication and social skills. Held in Easthampton, Massachusetts, Clarke's Summer Camp offers campers the opportunity to interact with other children with hearing loss from all over the country and make new friends. Children enjoy field trips, recreation, arts and crafts, hiking, swimming, and more.  President Coolidge  Goodhue, Clarence W. Barron and future President Calvin Coolidge According to historians at the school, Calvin Coolidge (standing far right in the photo with Clarence W. Barron in the center) lived on campus where he met his future wife in Grace Anna Goodhue (standing far left of picture below). In 1902, Mr. Coolidge lived in Adams House (formerly known as Weir House), a faculty house behind to the school's main dormitory. Grace Goodhue was a teacher at the school at the time when one morning, while working in the garden between Adams House and dormitory, she saw Mr. Coolidge (a lawyer working for a local practice) shaving in his second floor bathroom with a hat and a union suit on. Grace Goodhue thought it was a funny sight, and laughed out loud. That apparently got the attention of Coolidge and later that year, he and Grace Goodhue began dating. In 1905 Grace Goodhue left the school after only three years of service to marry Calvin and join him in his political career. After finishing his work as a local lawyer in Western Massachusetts, Calvin would go on to be the Mayor of Northampton, Governor of Massachusetts, Vice President and President of the United States of America.  Media  In 2007, Clarke School was featured in the PBS documentary, \\"Through Deaf Eyes\\" produced by Larry Hott. The documentary depicted deafness and Deaf culture in the United States and the choices parents face between sign language and oral language.

Although at one point treated as a junior synonym of Edmontonia by some taxonomists, current research indicates that it is a distinct nodosaurid genus. Discovery and naming In 1922, Philip Reinheimer, a collector and technician employed by the Colorado Museum of Natural History, the predecessor of the present Denver Museum of Nature and Science, near the Twito Ranch in Corson County, South Dakota discovered the fossil of an ankylosaurian in a Maastrichtian age terrestrial horizon of the Lance Formation. In 1943, American paleontologist Barnum Brown referred the find to Edmontonia longiceps.B. Brown and E.M. Schlaikjer, 1943, \\"A study of the tro√∂dont dinosaurs with the description of a new genus and four new species\\", Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 82(5): 115-150 In 1988, Robert Thomas Bakker decided to split the genus Edmontonia. The species Edmontonia rugosidens he made into a separate genus Chassternbergia and the Denver fossil was named and described as a new genus and species. The type species of this genus was Denversaurus schlessmani. The generic name referred to the Denver Museum of Natural History at Denver, Colorado. The specific name honoured Lee E. Schlessman, a major benefactor of the museum and the founder of the Schlessman Family Foundation.Bakker, R.T. (1988). \\"Review of the Late Cretaceous nodosauroid Dinosauria: Denversaurus schlessmani, a new armor- plated dinosaur from the Latest Cretaceous of South Dakota, the last survivor of the nodosaurians, with comments on Stegosaur-Nodosaur relationships\\". Hunteria 1(3): 1-23.(1988). The fossil the species is based on, the holotype DMNH 468, was discovered in a layer of the late Maastrichtian-age Lance Formation of South Dakota. It consists of a skull, lacking the lower jaws, and a number of osteoderms of the body armour. It is part of the collection of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science after which the genus was named. Bakker referred a second fossil to the species, specimen AMNH 3076, a skull found by Brown and American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Roland T. Bird at the Tornillo Creek in Brewster County, Texas, in a layer of the poorly dated Upper Cretaceous Aguja Formation, possibly from the Maastrichtian also. Scientists at the Black Hills Institute found a nodosaurid skeleton in Niobrara County, Wyoming, nick-named \\"Tank\\", which has been identified as Denversaurus. The specimen contains the lower jaws, parts of the torso and about a hundred osteoderms.

The validity of Denversaurus was disputed in a 1990 paper on ankylosaurian systematics by Kenneth Carpenter, who noted that Bakker's diagnosis of Denversaurus was based primarily on Bakker's artistic restoration of the holotype in an uncrushed state. Since DMNH 468 was found crushed, Carpenter assigned Denversaurus to a Edmontonia sp., even though he noted its similarity to Edmontonia rugosidens.Carpenter, K. 1990. \\"Ankylosaur systematics: example using Panoplosaurus and Edmontonia (Ankylosauria: Nodosauridae)\\", In: Carpenter, K. & Currie, P.J.

(2010). The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press. In a SVP 2015 abstract, Michael Burns revisited the systematics of latest Cretaceous nodosaurids from the Western Interior. According to Burns, Denversaurus is a valid taxon based on its phylogenetic position.Burns, ME. Intraspecific Variation in Late Cretaceous Nodosaurids (Ankylosauria: Dinosauria). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Program and Abstracts, 2015, 99‚Äì100. Description Casts of Denversaurus and Tyrannosaurus In 2010, American paleontologist Gregory S. Paul estimated the length of Denversaurus at six meters and its weight at three tonnes. American paleontologist Robert T. Bakker considered Denversaurus distinct from Edmontonia and Chassternbergia in having a skull that was wide at the rear and a more rearward position of the eye sockets. The holotype skull has a length of 496 millimetres and a rear width of 346 millimetres. In the referred specimen AMNH 3076 these proportions are less extreme, measuring 395 millimetres long with a rear width of 220 millimetre. According to American paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter, the greater width of both the holotype and the referred specimen was due to crushing. Vertebrate anatomist and paleontologist Michael Burns in 2015 published an abstract that concluded that Denversaurus was different from Edmontonia but similar to Panoplosaurus in having inflated, convex, cranial sculpturing with visible sulci, or troughs, between individual top skull armour elements, but is distinct from Panoplosaurus in having a relatively wider snout. Classification Bakker in 1988 placed Denversaurus within an Edmontoniidae, the presumed sister group of the Nodosauridae within a Nodosauroidea that would not have been Ankylosauria but the last surviving Stegosauria. These hypotheses have not been confirmed by modern cladistic analysis. Today the Denversaurus material, whether it presents a separate species or is identical to E. rugosidens or E. longiceps, is considered nodosaurid and ankylosaurian. Paul suggested that it were the direct descendant of E. longiceps. Burns recovered Denversaurus as the sister species of Panoplosaurus. Denversaurus is the latest known member of the Thyreophora.

LMV is seed-borne to a low but significant rate (1-10% of the seeds produced by an infected mother plant germinate into infected seedlings). This provides the primary inoculum in lettuce crops. LMV, and thus the mosaic disease, is then spread locally from plant to plant by the feeding stylets of aphids. Like all plant viruses, LMV is totally harmless to the consumer but causes defects in heading, leaf distortions and leaf colour anomalies, which altogether result in the infected lettuce plants to be unmarketable. Disease rates can reach 100% locally, and therefore cause complete loss of the harvest. LMV can also infect other crops such as spinach and peas, as well as ornamentals (especially the Cape Daisy Osteospermum spp) and wild plants (especially the prickly lettuce Lactuca serriola and the oxtongue Helminthia echioides). All these plants, and probably others, can serve as local sources from which LMV can spread to crops.  Hosts and Symptoms  Lettuce Mosaic Virus (LMV) has a wide host range. All types of lettuce are susceptible, including Crisphead, Romaine, Butterhead, and leaf lettuces. And in nature, the virus infects members of that same family (Asterceae), including crop plants such as lettuce, endive, escarole, as well as various weeds and wild lettuce species. Perennial weeds and ornamental hosts are also of great importance as they can be reservoirs for inoculum. The most commonly infected cultivated plants are endive, escarole, and lettuce. Other plants such as pea, safflower, and spinach may also become infected. Lettuce Mosaic Virus has a wide range of symptoms which depend on the cultivar or the type of lettuce, the age of the plant when infected, and the conditions of the environment. The disease gets its name from the characteristic green and yellow mottling and mosaic pattern that develops on the leaves of infected plants. Other symptoms of LMV often include yellowing of the leaves and vein clearing. In certain lettuce cultivars such as Crisphead, LMV-infected plants experience stunting and distortion of leaves. Leaves often develop a downward rolling of the leaf tips. Some infected plants also fail to form small heads, grow irregularly- shaped leaves, and experience stunting. Necrotic spots on stems and leaves may grow into wide-spread necrosis. Depending on the time of infection, infected lettuce cultivars develop different symptoms. Plants that were infected at later stages of growth develop mottling on leaves ranging from light-green to yellow in color. Infected lettuce plants that have flowered develop symptoms such as chlorosis of the leaves and stunting of the plant. Diagnosis of Lettuce Mosaic Virus can be difficult despite having characteristic symptoms. Numerous viruses may infect the species, which makes the diagnosis particularly difficult. Diagnosis of LMV infection in lettuce requires diagnostic tests to confirm the disease. Diagnostic tests that may be used to confirm the infection include serological methods such as lateral-flow devices and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing can also be used to confirm the infection. The development of these diagnostic techniques has led to an increase in the speed of diagnosis, allowing for it to occur in-field for lettuce crops.  Environment  While also spread by infected seeds, significant spread of Lettuce Mosaic Virus occurs from aphids (Denis, 2010). The virus can be spread by many species, including the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), the potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae), and the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Spread of the virus by non-persistent aphids has a short feeding period of less than one minute for transmission. Aphids that migrate from crop to crop briefly lead to increased exposure and spread of the virus. Certain symptoms of LMV are more pronounced in particular climates. Necrotic-like symptoms are more likely to occur in warmer seasonal conditions. Symptoms such as mosaic and mottling are more evident in leaf lettuces and Crisphead lettuces that grow in humid weather conditions. The incidence of plants infected by seed infection is determined by time of year in certain climates. In cultivars grown in California, the percentage of plants infected is significantly higher during the month of June rather than the spring months of March and April. Transmission of the virus in cultivars is considerably affected by the temperature in certain climates. Transmission rate is reduced significantly in high day temperatures compared to low day temperatures.  Importance  Lettuce Mosaic Virus is a very common and economically important viral disease that affects lettuce worldwide. The virus spread due to an increased exchange of seeds of various lettuce varieties between countries. It was first recorded in 1921 in lettuce crops in Florida. Since then it has been found in most of the world‚Äôs major lettuce growing countries. It has occurred in the United Kingdom, and all of Europe generally. It also impacts regions of South America (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay), Asia (China, Japan, Syria) and the Middle East (Egypt, Israel, Jordan). It is found commonly in the United States as well, especially in lettuce cultivars in California. When planted in cultivars of Little Gem and Saladin, LMV was found to cause devastating yield losses of 85% and 55%, respectively. Most severe losses most often occur in field crops. However, the virus can also infect greenhouse crops if the seedlings are not raised in insect free conditions.  Prevention  Like other diseases caused by viruses in plants, there are no means to cure plants from LMV once they are infected. Prevention of LMV can however be relatively efficient based on: *control of the absence of LMV in seed lots before trading; typically, ELISA is used and a rejection rate of 1 out of 30,000 seeds is applied; *the use of the recessive resistance gene mo1; mo1 has two commercial alleles (mo1¬π, formerly known as g, and mo1¬≤, formerly known as mo), both of which protect plants against LMV accumulation and, in some cases where LMV nevertheless accumulates, protect against symptom expression as well as prevents transmission through seed. In the late twentieth century, a novel type of LMV appeared in lettuce crops around the world: it was called LMV-Most (mo1-breaking, Seed-Transmitted) to account for its ability to infect and to spread through seeds even in the presence of mo1. Therefore, LMV-Most can only be prevented by controlling seeds, which consumes time, effort and money.

Holdstock broke into print in 1968. His science fiction and fantasy works explore philosophical, psychological, anthropological, spiritual and woodland themes. He received three BSFA awards and won the World Fantasy Award in the category of Best Novel of 1985. Biography Robert Holdstock, the eldest of five children, was born in Hythe, Kent. His father, Robert Frank Holdstock, was a police officer and his mother, Kathleen Madeline Holdstock, was a nurse. At the age of seven Robert started attending Gillingham Grammar School in the Medway Towns. As a young adult he had jobs including banana boatman, construction worker and slate miner.Holdstock, Robert Eye Among the Blind (New York: Doubleday & Company, 1976), back flap. He also earned a Bachelor of Science from University College of North Wales, Bangor, with honours in applied Zoology (1967-1970). He continued his education, earning a Master of Science in Medical Zoology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 1971. He conducted research at the Medical Research Council in London from 1971 to 1974, while also doing part-time writing and producing a science fiction fanzine. He became a full-time writer during 1976 and lived out the rest of his life in North London.Newman, Kim St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers, ed.

During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s Holdstock wrote many fantasy and science fiction novels along with a number of short stories, most of which were published under a pseudonym. Robert Holdstock's pseudonyms included Robert Faulcon, Chris Carlsen, Richard Kirk, Robert Black, Ken Blake, and Steven Eisler.The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, editors John Clute and John Grant (New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), page 474. These included some adaptions of television scripts for novelisations of television series including The Professionals.Pixley, Andrew: The Professionals MkIV Viewing Notes, Network, 2016. [Paperback book included with Blu-ray release] During this same period he wrote the text for Space Wars, Worlds and Weapons, a large format book in which he provided essays concerning the tropes of science fiction (and, in one chapter, sword and sorcery), accompanied by colour reproductions of related artwork. In 1980 Holdstock wrote Tour of the Universe with Malcolm Edwards. The rights were subsequently sold for a space shuttle simulation ride at the CN Tower, also called the Tour of the Universe. Holdstock's novel \\"The Dark Wheel\\",was included with the best-selling computer game Elite in 1984. He wrote an adaptation of The Emerald Forest, a film directed by John Boorman, and novelised episodes of the Granada Television series Bulman. Holdstock's breakthrough novel Mythago Wood was published in 1984. It began the Ryhope Wood series,Langford, David Supernatural Fiction Writers, Second Edition, Volume 1, ed. Richard Bleiler (New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003), page 446. which continued until the appearance of Avilion in 2009. Holdstock was guest of honour at the annual Novacon in 1984, and a limited-edition chapbook featuring his fantasy story 'Thorn' was presented to the first 500 attendees. Between 2001 and 2007 Holdstock produced a trilogy of fantasy novels, the Merlin Codex, consisting of Celtika, The Iron Grail and The Broken Kings. Holdstock wrote, edited or contributed to a number of nonfiction works, including Alien Landscapes, Tour of the Universe, Horror: 100 Best Novels and Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (a different publication than The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction published in 1979, edited by Peter Nicholls). In 2013 a joint volume of poetry with Garry Kilworth (with whom he collaborated on the award-winning novella \\"The Ragthorn\\") was published by PS Publishing, Poems, Peoms and Other Atrocities. Critical reception David Pringle described Eye Among the Blind, Holdstock's first science fiction novel, as a \\"dogged, detailed, somewhat slow-moving planetary mystery\\".The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, David Pringle (London: Grafton, 1990), page 111. Ursula K. Le Guin called the same novel \\"As strong a treatment of a central theme of science fiction - alienness, and the relation of the human and the alien - as any I have read.\\"The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, David Pringle (London: Grafton, 1990), page 111. According to Michael D. C. Drout, Holdstock's Ryhope Wood series is a significant part of the fantasy genre, displaying the power and aesthetic standards of Tolkien‚Äôs fantasy without being either a \\"close imitation of\\" or a \\"reaction against\\" Tolkien. Drout considers Holdstock, along with Ursula K. Le Guin, a worthy inheritor of the fantasy tradition created by Tolkien.Drout, Michael D.C. Of Sorcerers and Men: Tolkien and the Roots of Modern Fantasy Literature, China: Barnes & Noble Publishing, 2006, page 56. Patrick Curry placed Holdstock in a quartet of noteworthy fantasy authors, alongside Le Guin, John Crowley and Marion Zimmer Bradley, for writing fantasy books that come close to Tolkien's breadth and depth of imagination, and \\"in some respects surpass Tolkien\\".Curry, Patrick Defending Middle-Earth: Tolkien: Myth and Modernity, New York, NY: Houghton Mifflin, 2004, pages 132-133 David Langford offers praise for most of Holdstock's work, but regarded Merlin's Wood less highly: \\"the overall narrative is flawed, distorted by its weight of undeserved loss and inaccessible healing\\".Langford, David Supernatural Fiction Writers, Second Edition, Volume 1, ed. Richard Bleiler (New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003), page 450. Book covers The covers of Holdstock's books were produced by a variety of illustrators. The original UK and US covers of Mythago Wood were illustrated by Eddi Gornall and Christopher Zacharow, respectively; Geoff Taylor illustrated the original UK covers for the Mythago Wood sequels Lavondyss, The Bone Forest, The Hollowing and Merlin's Wood. Illustrators of subsequent covers and editions include Jim Burns, Tom Canty, John Howe, Alan Lee, John Jude Palencar, Larry Rostant and Ron Walotsky.

Two survive: RV 588 and RV 589. A third, RV 590, is mentioned only in the Kreuzherren catalogue and presumed lost. The RV 589 Gloria is a familiar and popular piece among sacred works by Vivaldi. It was probably written at about the same time as the RV 588, possibly in 1715.  Introduction  As with other choral pieces the composer, Vivaldi, wrote many introduzione (introductory motets) that were to be performed before the Gloria itself. Four introduzioni exist for these Glorias: Cur Sagittas (RV 637), Jubilate, o amoeni cori (RV 639) (the last movement of which is compositionally tied with the first movement of RV 588), Longe Mala, Umbrae, Terrores (RV 640), and Ostro Picta (RV 642).  Settings  = RV 588 = The lesser known of the two surviving Glorias, RV 588 was most likely composed during Vivaldi's employment at the Pio Ospedale della Piet√†, known for its advanced choral ensemble. The first movement is interwoven with the last aria of RV 639, as explained above. The date of composition between this Gloria and RV 589 is still disputed, but both show compositional inspiration from each other. RV 588 borrows extensively from a double orchestra-and-choir setting of the same text by Giovanni Maria Ruggieri (which will henceforth in this article be referred by its RV cataloguing number of RV. Anh. 23). Many movements show inspiration from this composition, and two movements (\\"Qui Tollis\\" and \\"Cum Sancto Spiritu\\") are plagiarised from the original Ruggieri setting (although \\"Qui Tollis\\" completely omits the second coro (chorus), and \\"Cum Sancto Spiritu\\" is slightly modified). The first movement of RV 588 is also an extended version of RV Anh. 23, sans the second coro employed in RV Anh. 23, among other musical modifications. The second movements of both RV 588 and RV 589 (\\"Et in Terra Pax\\") both show chromatic patterns and key modulations similar to that of the second movement of RV Anh. 23.  Movements  #Gloria in excelsis Deo (Chorus) #Et in terra pax (Chorus) #Laudamus te (Sopranos I and II) #Gratias agimus tibi (Chorus) #Propter magnam gloria (Chorus) #Domine Deus (Soprano) #Domine, Fili unigenite (Chorus) #Domine Deus, Agnus Dei (Alto, Chorus) #Qui tollis peccata mundi (Chorus) #Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris (Mezzo Soprano) #Quoniam tu solus sanctus (Chorus) #Cum Sancto Spiritu (Chorus) = RV 589 = This is the better known setting of the Gloria, simply known as the Vivaldi \\"Gloria\\" due to its outstanding popularity. This piece, along with its mother composition RV 588, was composed at the same time during Vivaldi's employment at the Pieta. Two introduzioni exist as explained in the aforementioned article. As in RV 588, there exists evidence of influence by RV Anh. 23: the first movement's chorus shares similar key modulations to that of the first movement of RV 588, only modified to fit a duple meter instead of the triple meter of RV 588. Motivic material present in the orchestral parts of either piece are also shared, including octave jumps in the opening motives of the piece. The second movement is significantly more chromatic in RV 589, but nonetheless is texturally similar to the setting present in RV Anh. 23, with the use of repeating rhythmic figures underneath harmonic motion. The \\"Qui Tollis\\" movement of RV 589 is rhythmically similar to the first few measures of RV 588 (and ultimately RV Anh. 23). The last movement, \\"Cum Sancto Spiritu,\\" is essentially an \\"updated\\" version of movement present in both RV Anh. 23 and RV 588, except extensively harmonically modified, becoming more chromatic than its predecessors, reflecting a maturity in Vivaldi's output and the emerging style of the late Italian Baroque.  Movements  #Gloria (Chorus) #Et in terra pax (Chorus) #Laudamus te (Sopranos I and II) #Gratias agimus tibi (Chorus) #Propter magnam gloriam (Chorus) #Domine Deus (Soprano) #Domine, Fili unigenite (Chorus) #Domine Deus, Agnus Dei (Contralto and Chorus) #Qui tollis peccata mundi (Chorus) #Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris (Contralto) #Quoniam tu solus sanctus (Chorus) #Cum Sancto Spiritu (Chorus) = RV 590 = Little information exists on this lost work other than its instrumentation (five voices and oboes in trombae) in the Kreuzherren catalogue. There is no other source of information; not even its possible key can be conjectured. In the Ryom-Verzeichnis catalogue, it is considered lost. = RV Anh. 23 = As stated above, this Gloria for two cori (orchestras) was written by Giovanni Maria Ruggieri. This composition, probably for a Venetian church during a festival, is dated September 9, 1708 N.S. This Gloria provided much inspiration for Vivaldi's two settings and for other Glorias by other composers at the time, who may have used it in their settings.  Movements  #Gloria in excelsis Deo (Chorus) #Et in terra pax (Seven Bass soloists) #Laudamus te (Chorus, Sopranos I and II, Tenor) #Gratias agimus tibi (Chorus) #Propter Magnam Gloriam (Chorus) #Domine Deus (Sopranos I and II and Bass from first coro, Sopranos III and VI and Bass from second coro) #Domine, Fili unigenite (Chorus) #Domine Deus, Agnus Dei (Chorus) #Qui tollis peccata mundi (Chorus) #Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris (Chorus and Soprano, Contralto, and Tenor) #Quoniam tu solus sanctus (Chorus) #Cum Sancto Spiritu (Chorus)  Popularity  The Glorias remained in a relatively unknown status, until RV 589's revival by Alfredo Casella during \\"Vivaldi Week\\" in Siena (1939), along with the composer's setting of the Stabat Mater (RV 621). RV 589 enjoys well- founded popularity, performed at many sacred events, including Christmas. It has been recorded on almost one hundred CDs, sometimes paired with Bach's Magnificat (BWV 243), Vivaldi's own Magnificat settings (RV 610-611), or Vivaldi's Beatus Vir (RV 597). RV 588, however, has had little success and has only been published in few albums. Attempts to create more attention to RV 588 and other sacred Vivaldi works (most notably by The King's Consort) are underway. As with many other pieces of the Baroque era, RV 589 (and its lesser known companion RV 588) have been performed in historically-informed instrumentation, even with the use of an all-female choir to simulate choral conditions at the Piet√†. There are several different editions, and choirs need to exercise caution when combining different vocal and orchestral editions. RV 589 has also been used in a number of films. The first movement featured in the 1996 Scott Hicks film Shine about pianist David Helfgott, as well as in the 2011 film The Hunter. An adaptation of the second movement was used with profound effect in the final climactic scenes of the 1985 Andrei Konchalovsky film Runaway Train.

It is currently the 17th-largest diocese in the United States by population, encompassing the counties of Ashland, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Summit, and Wayne. , the current bishop is Edward Charles Malesic. The Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist located in downtown Cleveland is the mother church of the diocese. As of 2017, the Diocese had a population of approximately 677,219 Catholics and contained 185 parishes, 22 Catholic high schools, three Catholic hospitals, three universities, two shrines (St. Paul Shrine Church and St. Stanislaus Church), and two seminaries (Centers for Pastoral Leadership). The diocese has 258 active priests and 1,035 sisters. Parish closings On, March 14, 2009, the diocese announced that 52 parishes in the diocese would close or merge (29 parishes closing, 42 parishes merging to form 18 new parishes) due to the shortage of priests, declining numbers of parishioners in some parishes, the migration of Catholic populations to the suburbs and out of the city cores, and financial difficulties in some parishes. A number of parish schools in the diocese also closed or merged due to declining enrollment, and financial difficulties.Diocese of Cleveland Reconfiguration Office - List of Closing/Merging Parishes. Retrieved on March 25, 2009. Archived copy at WebCite (February 15, 2013). Letters to all of the parishes from Bishop Richard Lennon giving his decision on what parishes and schools were closing or merging, and which parishes and schools would remain open, were read to the parishioners by the church pastors at Masses the weekend of March 14‚Äì15, 2009. Hardest hit by the closings were downtown Cleveland, downtown Akron, downtown Lorain, and downtown Elyria. Parishioners of thirteen of the parishes then requested appeals from the Congregation for the Clergy in Rome. On March 8, 2012, the Vatican overturned all thirteen of the church closings (nine in the Greater Cleveland area, one in Lorain and three in Akron) because the Vatican says that Bishop Lennon did not follow procedure or canon law in that he did not consult with the priest advisors, and he did not issue a formal mandate for the closing of the churches. In the meantime, according to canon law, the thirteen closed churches were ordered to be reopened, and be available to parishioners. On April 10, 2012, Bishop Lennon announced that he would not appeal the decision of the Vatican to the Apostolic Signatura in Rome, thus paving the way for the thirteen churches to be reopened. This mandate was implemented starting on June 10, 2012, raising the number of parishes in the diocese from 172 parishes to 185 parishes.

She is the earliest known ruling African queen of ancient Nubia, and reigned from about 170 to 150 BC, although the period 170‚Äì160 BC is also mentioned. She is said to have ruled with full power in the Mero√´ Empire. She is also said to have ruled without a king. It is also stated that as queen she played a significant role in the Meroitic religion. In the 2nd century BC Shanakdakheto built the Temple F at Naqa, which has an unusual feature in the first half of the temple with the interior partitions where the gods face the back wall. Overview The pyramid of Shanakdakheto at Mero√´ (N11) Shanakdakheto's name is inscribed as a royal queen in the Egyptian Meroitic hieroglyphs. This inscription is the one seen on the doorjambs of the altar niche of Temple F in Naqa. Shanakdakheto styled herself as: Son of Re, Lord of the Two Lands, Shanakdakheto (Sa Re nebtawy, Shanakdakheto).L√°szl√≥ T√∂r√∂k, The kingdom of Kush: handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic Civilization, 1997 The inscription reads: :The royal-waab-priest of the Son of Re: Shanakdakheto given life every day 'beloved of Ma'at' like... , :The son of Re, ..the Lord of the Two Lands (Egypt): Shanakdakhete. Meroites scripted their own language in the early part of the second century BC (alphabetical script during the reign of Ergamenes), the language is still not fully deciphered) and its first epigraphic inscription is said to be of Queen Shannakdahane in the Temple F at Naqa. Even though her family antecedents remain obscure, in one of her carvings on a dorsal pillar she is shown adorned with an insignia of rank on the forehead and a crown, similar to the one worn by the reigning kings with decoration of a sun-disk and tall feathers. The garment decorating her, similar to that seen in Pharaonic art, like Uraeus, is drawn as a three-part royal costume. The necklace and her earrings have decoration of a goat head, a sacred animal of the god Amun used in Kushite decorative tradition which was popular in Nubia. The prince standing next to her, wearing a tunic draped around the left shoulder in Greek style, is shown with an ordinary band as a crown. The two figures are shown with their left foot forward. As an African beauty, the queen is shown with a strong build, and bejeweled, a trait indicating wealth, power and prosperity, and child bearing capacity. In the decorations of her mortuary chapel, the architectural features are highly artistic. In one sunken relief the queen is depicted wearing an embellished garment and bejeweled, sitting on a royal seat shaped as lion, carrying a spear and palm branch in her right, with her left hand raised. A double cartouche found in Naqa is dated to a later part of the second century BC which is said to be the earliest epigraph in meroitic hieroglyphs. However, the hieroglyphic cursive on the Queen's cartouche is called \\"classical\\" in style, not seen on the Jebel Barkal slab of Tanyidamani's cartouche who was considered Shanakdakhete's successor. Her pyramid was identified at Mero√´, next to Tanyidamani's but not established as her name is not preserved. In the tomb chapel reliefs of Queen Shanakdakhete the carvings show men holding arrows as a Meroitic burial custom. Sandstone relief stele, a part of decoration of the wall in a pyramid chapel of Meroe, now in the British Museum, perhaps belonging to Queen Shanakdakheto In the sandstone relief stele (pictured) displayed at the British Museum which is the part of the wall of the steep-sided pyramids of the cemetery at Meroe, it is believed that Queen Shanakdakhete is shown enthroned with a prince standing next to her under the protection of Isis with wings. Scenes of religious offerings, the queen's evaluation in front of Osiris, and a number of bearers lined in the front carrying gifts are depicted in the reliefs.

The museum, housed in a 13th-century Dominican religious sisters' convent and a 1906 former public baths building, is home to the Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Gr√ºnewald and features a large collection of local and international artworks and manufactured artifacts from prehistorical to contemporary times. It is a Mus√©e de France. With roughly 200,000 visitors per year, the museum is the most visited in Alsace.Number of visitors to French museums in 2006 History View (from the 18th century loft) of the chapel, constructed 1262-1269,History of the building and the Isenheim Altarpiece The museum was established in 1849, the buildings (abandoned following the French Revolution) having been saved by the Societ√© Schongauer (founded in 1847 by Louis Hugot History of the Schongauer society ) and bequeathed to it by the municipality. The collection at first centered around a Roman mosaic found in Bergheim, Haut-Rhin, still displayed today, and plaster copies of antique sculptures on loan from the Louvre. In 1852, the focus of the collection shifted dramatically, when the Isenheim Altarpiece as well as most of the other large painted and/or sculpted altarpieces from former Colmar or Upper Rhenish churches, abbeys and monasteries, were installed in the building. The museum opened its doors to the general public in the following year, 1853.Description of the museum on culture.gouv.fr In the 1950s and again in the 1980s, the need appeared for the museum, which had seen a steady growth of the number of its displayed artefacts in every domain, to gain more space by using available surface more appropriately, and was each time addressed as far as the classified character of the building in itself could allow. When that same need appeared again in the 2000s, the city of Colmar decided to add supplementary buildings. As the museum's official website used to state before the opening of the 2015 extension : \\"Today the museum covers a surface area of about 5,620 m¬≤, including exhibition spaces (4,000 m¬≤), conservation, storage and other work areas (1,370 m¬≤), and offices (250 m¬≤)\\". Between 2009 and 2015, the adjacent, Neo-Baroque former baths building was transformed into an annex of the museum, connected to the old building by a series of underground exhibition rooms. A new building for temporary exhibitions was also added while the former cloister was once again thoroughly renovated and its interior spaces redistributed. The total area open to the public was thus enlarged to , at an official cost of 44 M‚Ç¨, although it appeared at the end of the year 2016 that the final cost was actually of 48,7 M‚Ç¨, a fact which infuriated Colmar's long-time mayor, Gilbert Meyer. The opening of the enlarged museum took place on 12 December 2015. The collections Outside view of the chapel Famous above all for the Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Gr√ºnewald, it also displays a major collection of Upper Rhenish medieval and early Renaissance art, among which the Colmar native Martin Schongauer occupies the most prominent place with several altarpieces and a large number of original drawings, engravings and woodcuts.Samples of the collection on the Base Joconde Other famous names include Albrecht D√ºrer (engravings only), Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Holbein the Elder as well as local painters Caspar Isenmann, Jost Haller and Wilhelm Stetter. Most of the earliest paintings, however, are the work of anonymous German, Alsatian or Swiss masters, such as the Master of the Stauffenberg Altarpiece. Other sections displayed by the museum are : local and international archeology; medieval, Renaissance and baroque sculpture (religious as well as profane) and stained glass; weapons, furniture, music instruments and toys from the 14th to the 19th century; ancient, ornate wine barrels (a collection donated by Jean-Jacques Waltz in 1927); modern and contemporary art. Because of a general lack of space, this last collection, although very well furnished (works by Pablo Picasso, Jean Dubuffet, Fernand L√©ger, Serge Poliakoff, Georges Rouault, Pierre Bonnard, Robert Delaunay, Otto Dix, Maria Helena Vieira da Silva and others) had only seldom been displayed in its entirety. The 2015 enlargement of the building by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron has explicitly been meant to address this problem.  Expansion  In order to renovate the museum and provide more space to its collections, in 2009 the Colmar municipality organized a design competition, and eventually selected the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron to design the renovation project. The new venue, which almost doubles the floor area of the old Unterlinden museum, was inaugurated January 23, 2016 by the President of France Fran√ßois Hollande.

He was born in County Wexford, Ireland in 1803, the son of Hunter Gowan, an Orangeman and small landowner and godson of George Ogle, a grand master of the Irish Orange Order. Hunter Gowan led a yeomanry corps known as the \\"Black Mob\\" which was accused of committing atrocities against Catholic civilians before and after the outbreak of the Wexford Rebellion; he remains a hate-figure in local nationalist tradition. In 1825, when the Irish Orange lodges were dissolved, Ogle Gowan became assistant secretary for Sir Harcourt Lees' Benevolent and Loyal Orange Institution of Ireland. He arrived in Leeds County, Upper Canada in 1829 and settled in Brockville. In 1830, he called a meeting which formed the Grand Orange Lodge of British North America; Gowan became its deputy grand master and later became Canadian grand master. Gowan was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Leeds in 1834 and 1835 but was unseated due to violence at the polls by his Orange supporters. In 1836, he was elected in Leeds; despite his innate distrust of Roman Catholics, he had formed an alliance with Catholic voters to help bolster his support at the polls. In the same year, he founded the Brockville Statesman. During the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837, he helped raise a company of volunteers which also fought at the Battle of the Windmill. After the rebellion, Gowan declared his support for responsible government and the division of the clergy reserves among all recognized religious groups in the province. In 1844, he was elected to the 2nd Parliament of the Province of Canada for Leeds and Grenville. In the assembly, he supported John A. Macdonald against the interests of the Family Compact. In 1846, he was replaced by George Benjamin as grand master of the Orange Order in Canada. He helped lead the Orange opposition to the Rebellion Losses Bill in Canada West. In 1849, he stated his support for an elected Legislative Council. In 1852, he moved to Toronto where he served on city council in 1853 and 1854 and took over the publishing of the Toronto Patriot, formerly a Family Compact newspaper. In 1853, he regained the position of grand master, but Benjamin's supporters formed a separate Orange organization. In 1856, Gowan stepped down to allow the rift to be healed under a new grand master, George Lyttleton Allen. He was elected in an 1858 by- election to represent North Leeds and, in 1861, he retired from politics.

J. \\"Red\\" Arnall, a reworking of the traditional song \\"Little Sadie\\". Background The song is the tale of a man, Willy Lee, who murders his unfaithful girlfriend while under the influence of whiskey and cocaine. He flees to Mexico and works as a musician to fund his continued drug use. Willy is apprehended by a sheriff from Jericho Hill, tried, and promptly sentenced to \\"ninety-nine years in the San Quentin Pen\\". The song ends with Willy imploring the listener: Early recordings This song was originally recorded by W. A. Nichol's Western Aces (vocal by \\"Red\\" Arnall) on the S & G label, probably in 1947, and by Roy Hogsed and the Rainbow Riders May 25, 1947, at Universal Recorders in Hollywood, California. Hogsed's recording was released on Coast Records (262) and Capitol (40120), with the Capitol release reaching number 15 on the country music charts in 1948. Johnny Cash versions Johnny Cash famously performed the song at his 1968 Folsom Prison concert. He replaced the lyric \\"San Quentin\\" with \\"Folsom\\", and changed \\"C'mon you hypes...\\" to \\"C'mon you gotta listen unto me...\\", as well as using the then-provocative lyric \\"I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down.\\" Cash also altered the last line to \\"Lay off the whiskey...\\" instead of \\"Drink all you want...\\". During the performance, which was released uncensored by Columbia Records in 1968 (though other language is censored), Cash can be heard coughing occasionally; later in the concert recording, he can be heard noting that singing the song nearly did his voice in. The song was also featured on Cash's 1960 Columbia album Now, There Was a Song! under the title \\"Transfusion Blues\\" substituting the line \\"took a shot of cocaine\\" with \\"took a transfusion\\" along with some other minor lyrical changes (and a tamer version of the climactic lyric \\"I can't forget the day I shot my woman down\\"). Cash later recorded \\"Cocaine Blues\\" for his 1979 album Silver. Cash chose not to use the word \\"bitch\\" in this version. Cash also performed the song -- with original lyrics and the use of the word \\"bitch\\" -- for his December 1969 performance at Madison Square Garden, which was recorded but withheld from release until Johnny Cash at Madison Square Garden was released by Columbia Records in 2002. Cash's Folsom Prison performance of \\"Cocaine Blues\\" was portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the 2005 Cash biographical film Walk the Line. The film version, edited down to make it shorter, fades into the next scene before the line \\"I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down\\" is sung. The DVD specials include an extended version of the song with the lyric, and the full, unedited version (apparently a different \\"take\\") is found on the soundtrack CD. Recordings by other artists Several artists have recorded \\"Cocaine Blues\\", including: * Woody Guthrie (1944) * Hank Thompson (1959) * Hylo Brown (1963) * Townes Van Zandt (1973) * George Thorogood and The Destroyers (1978) * Uncle Tupelo (live versions 1988-1993) * Hank Williams III (1999) *Electric Frankenstein (2001) *Eddie Spaghetti (2003) * Joaquin Phoenixtwo versions for Walk the Line film soundtrack (2005) * The Loved Ones (2008) * Merle Haggard (2011) * Merle Travis Other versions Arnall is also sometimes credited with the version of \\"Cocaine Blues\\" written and recorded by Billy Hughes (also in 1947).Kienzle, Southwest Shuffle, p. 76 \\"... Billy Hughes, composer of 'Tennessee Saturday Night' and 'Cocaine Blues,' ...\\" The music is similar, bearing a marked resemblance to 'Little Sadie\\", however the lyrics in Hughes' vary considerably from Arnall's. For instance, Hughes has the Cocaine Kid, not Willy Lee, killing \\"his woman and a rounder, too\\" in Tulsa, being captured in El Paso, and sentenced to \\"ninety-nine years way down in Mac.\\" It ends with: Other songs titled \\"Cocaine Blues\\" \\"Cocaine Habit Blues\\"/\\"Take a Whiff on Me\\" :Another song is often known as ‚ÄúCocaine Blues‚Äù but is completely different; it also known, in its different versions, as ‚ÄúTake a Whiff on Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúCocaine Habit Blues‚Äù. This song has three families of variants. \\"Cocaine Blues\\"/\\"Coco Blues\\" :One of the most familiar, usually known as \\"Cocaine Blues,\\" is Reverend Gary Davis‚Äôs arrangement, an eight-bar blues in C Major. Davis said that he learned the song in 1905 from a traveling carnival musician, Porter Irving. This version is made up of rhyming couplets, followed by a refrain \\"Cocaine, running all around my brain\\" or \\"Cocaine, all around my brain\\").Kemper Kokaine song Nr.020, p.288 The song is sometimes known as \\"Coco Blues,\\" as on Davis‚Äô 1965 album Pure Religion and Bad Company. :Gary Davis was a key influence on the folk revival singers of the early 1960s, including Dave Van Ronk, who learned this version of \\"Cocaine Blues\\" from Davis (it features on his 1963 album Folksinger) and Bob Dylan (a 1961 variant features on The Minnesota Tapes, a 1962 variant is on Gaslight Tapes and a third version performed live in 1997 is on the more recent compilation album Tell Tale Signs). On Van Ronk‚Äôs record, the song is wrongly credited to Luke Jordan, who recorded a completely different song of the same name, see below.See Waltz and Engle \\"Cocaine Blues (I)\\" in the Traditional Ballad IndexKemper Kokaine Songs Nr.020 (Davis), 022 (Van Ronk), 023 (Dylan), 024 (Van Ronk), 025 (Tom Rush) :Davis‚Äô version of \\"Cocaine Blues\\" was subsequently recorded by a number of artists in the folk revival/singer-songwriter tradition, including Ramblin' Jack Elliott (1958 on Jack Takes the Floor and 1995 on South Coast), Richard Fari√±a and Eric Von Schmidt (1963), Hoyt Axton (1963, on Thunder 'n Lightning), Davey Graham (1964, on Folk, Blues and Beyond), Nick Drake (on Tanworth-in-Arden 1967-68 and Family Treepitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10391-family-tree/), Led Zeppelin played a version in concert at Budokan, Tokyo, 1971, Jackson Browne (1977, on Running on Empty), Stefan Grossman (1978, on Acoustic Guitar), Townes Van Zandt (1977, on Live at the Old Quarter and 1993, on Roadsongs), as well as by the punk band UK Subs and live by Cryin' D.T. Buffkin and his band the Bad Breath.Kemper Kokaine Song Nr.122, p.326 \\"Sweet Cocaine\\" by Fred Neil (1966) is loosely based on the same song, same is Small Faces and Humble Pie singer Steve Marriott's \\"Cocaine\\", recorded in 1971 and released on the 1998 compilation album \\"Steve Marriott's Scrubbers\\".Kemper Kokaine Song Nr.050 German singer-songwriter Hannes Wader covered the song as \\"Kokain\\" on his 1972 album 7 Lieder (Seven Songs), with the English chorus and new verses in German. The refrain, \\"Cocaine runnin‚Äô all 'round my brain,\\" was used by reggae artist Dillinger in \\"Cocaine In My Brain\\" (\\"I've got cocaine runnin' around my brain\\") and more recently in turn by hip hop group Poor Righteous Teachers in the song \\"Miss Ghetto\\" on the album The New World Order (\\"She's like cocaine, running around my brain/Miss Ghetto be like cocaine, running around your brain\\"). :In 2013 Los Angeles skate-punk band FIDLAR recorded a version titled \\"Cocaine\\" on their eponymous debut album. This rendition was featured on the Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack. English indie rock singer Kate Nash covered this version, changing the title to \\"Girl Gang.\\" \\"Take a Whiff on Me\\" :Secondly, ‚ÄúTake a Whiff on Me‚Äù (again often known as ‚ÄúCocaine Blues‚Äù) shares chords and many rhyming couplets with this song, but with the refrain ‚ÄúHoney, take a whiff on me‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúCocaine runnin‚Äô all 'round my brain‚Äù. This version is most strongly associated with Lead Belly, whose version opens with ‚ÄúWalked up Ellum and I come down Main.‚Äù (‚ÄúEllum‚Äù, ‚ÄúElem‚Äù and ‚ÄúDep Elem‚Äù in various version, refers to Elm Street in Dallas, in that city‚Äôs red light district).Waltz and Engle ‚ÄúDeep Elem Blues‚Äù The song was first published by John Lomax in 1934 as \\"Honey, Take a Whiff on Me\\". Lomax stated that its origins were uncertain.Lomax, American Ballads and Folk Songs, p. 186: \\"The origin of this cheerful ditty of the dope-heads is doubtful. At any rate the Southern barrel-house Negroes sing it and have made it their own.\\" :Variants on the Lead Belly version have been recorded by Blind Jesse Harris (1937), Woody Guthrie, Roy Bookbinder, Merle Travis, The Byrds (1970), Mungo Jerry (as ‚ÄúHave a Whiff on Me‚Äù, 1971 single), Old Crow Medicine Show (\\"Cocaine Habit\\" from their 2006 album Big Iron World), The White Stripes, Abner Jay, and others.\\"Take a Whiff On Me\\" [Me II-Z26] on Folk Music Index at Ibiblio.org \\"Take a Drink on Me\\" :The song ‚ÄúTake a Drink with Me‚Äù/‚ÄùTake a Drink on Me‚Äù, recorded by white old-time music performer Charlie Poole in 1927 and collected by various folklorists,Waltz and Engle ‚ÄúTake a Drink on Me‚Äù is a variant on \\"Take A Whiff On Me\\", with alcohol rather than cocaine as the drug of choice. This in turn has been performed by a number of artists in the folk music and country music traditions, including the New Lost City Ramblers.\\"Take a Drink on Me\\" [Me II-Z26] on Folk Music Index at Ibiblio.org It shares some words with Frank Hutchison‚Äôs 1927 ballad ‚ÄúConey Isle‚Äù.Waltz and Engle ‚ÄúConey Isle‚Äù \\"Cocaine Habit Blues\\" :A third, very closely related to this version is the one also commonly known as ‚ÄúCocaine Habit Blues‚Äù, recorded by the Memphis Jug Band in 1930 (credited to Jennie Mae Clayton).Kemper Kokaine song Nr.004, p.283 It was a jug band standard, later recorded by the Panama Limited Jug Band and by Jerry Garcia in Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions in 1964. Its introductory verse is ‚ÄúOh cocaine habit mighty bad‚Äù. \\"Croquet Habits\\" :This disguised version of \\"Cocaine Habit Blues\\" was recorded by Freeny's Barn Dance Band in 1930. After the first verse, there is no similarity in the lyrics. \\"Tell It to Me\\" :Another traditional song of unknown authorship, it is often known as \\"Cocaine Blues\\".Tullos, Long Journey Home, p. 11: \\"... The Grant Brothers, from nearby Bristol, recorded a song called 'Tell It To Me,' known widely today as 'Cocaine Blues' ...\\" Also called \\"Let The Cocaine Be\\", some musicologists see a relationship to \\"Take A Whiff On Me\\" since some versions share the same lines.Waltz, \\"Take a Whiff on Me\\": \\"I'm joining them primarily because many versions of \\"Tell It to Me\\" include the 'Honey, take a whiff on me\\" refrain, but a case could also be made for splitting'.\\" It has a similar structure to \\"Take a Whiff\\"/\\"Cocaine Habit Blues\\", and some versions share couplets (e.g. \\"Cocaine's [dose] is not for a man/Doctor said will kill you, but he don't say when\\" and \\"You know I walked down Fifth and I turned down Main/Looking for a nickel for to buy cocaine\\"), but the refrain is darker: \\"Cocaine that killed my honey dead\\". :A version was collected (as ‚ÄúCocaine‚Äù) by folklorist Mellinger Edward Henry (1873‚Äì1946) in his Folk Songs from the Southern Highlands from the singing of Barnet George, Lithonia, Georgia, July 1931. The earliest recorded version is by white Tennessee band The Grant Brothers in 1928 (Columbia 15332-D).Russell, Country Music Records, p. 377. Collected on My Rough and Rowdy Ways, Vol. 1, Yazoo 2039, 1998. It has been recorded by numerous folk revival artists,\\"Tell It to Me\\" [Me II-Z27] on Folk Music Index at Ibiblio.org including David Grisman and the New York City Ramblers at the Newport Folk Festival. Grisman collaborated with the Grateful Dead in 1970, and they included it in their live repertoire at that time. It has more recently been covered by Old Crow Medicine Show and White Ghost Shivers. \\"Cocaine Done Killed My Baby\\" :This song recorded by Mance Lipscomb has the same refrain, but lacks the \\"Tell it to me\\" theme. \\"Cocaine\\" :Another song of the same title (sometimes called simply \\"Cocaine\\" or \\"Simply Wild About My Good Cocaine\\") was recorded by bluesman Luke Jordan in 1927 as \\"Cocaine Blues\\", interspersed with verses from another song \\"Furniture Man\\".Paul Oliver Songsters and Saints: Vocal Traditions in Race Records, Cambridge University Press, 1984; Wolf-Reienhard Kemper Kokain in der Musik: Bestandsaufnahme und Analyse aus kriminologischer Sicht Song Nr.002-3, p.282 The White singer Dick Justice record a cover under the title \\"Cocaine\\" in 1929. It copied all of Jordan's text, including the \\"Furniture Man\\" verses. In 1930, The Kentucky Ramblers sang most of Jordan's version (including the \\"Furniture Man\\" verses) as the first part of a medley entitled \\"Good Cocaine (Mama Don't Allow It)\\". David Bromberg recorded a version as \\"Cocaine Blues\\"; it was recorded under the same name by the Holy Modal Rounders on their 1967 album Indian War Whoop. The Luke Jordan lyrics share some lines (\\"Cocaine's for horses and not for men/Doctor says it'll kill you but don't know when\\") with \\"Take a Whiff on Me\\" as recorded by Lead Belly and the Reverend Gary Davis version of \\"Cocaine Blues\\" as recorded by Bob Dylan.

Roski Jr. (born 1938) is an American businessman, real estate developer, billionaire, and president of Majestic Realty. He appeared at # 97 on the Forbes 400 in 2017, and owns more than 83 million square feet of real estate across the United States, as a business park developer through his company. Roski has served as its president since 1994, and previously as the executive vice-president and chief operating officer, from 1978 to 1994. Roski partially owns the Los Angeles Kings, and the Los Angeles Lakers, and owns the Silverton Las Vegas. He is also a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, philanthropist, and art collector. Early life and education Roski was born in 1938, in Oklahoma. His father Ed Roski Sr., was the son of a poor immigrant family from Poland who did not finish high school. Roski Sr. served in the United States Navy during World War II, then moved the family to Southern California, where he founded Majestic Realty in 1948. Roski Jr. attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles, and graduated from the University of Southern California in 1962, with a bachelor's degree in real estate and finance. He joined Majestic Realty in 1966. United States Marine Corps Roski enrolled in the United States Marine Corps after graduating in 1962. After attending The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, he reported to the First Marine Brigade, and was later assigned to 1st Battalion, 4th Marines. In 1965, Roski was deployed from Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay to South Vietnam. He was wounded in Chu Lai during Operation Starlite, and was awarded a Bronze Star Medal and two Purple Hearts. In 2000, General James L. Jones and the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation honored Roski with its Semper Fidelis award. In 2007, Roski founded the Land of the Free Foundation to support war veterans and families, and he has contributed more than $10 million to its efforts. In October 2017, Roski earned the Circle of Honor Award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation. Professional sports teams Roski became a minority owner of the Los Angeles Kings in 1995 and a minority owner of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1998. Roski and Philip Anschutz were majority owners of the Los Angeles Arena Company, looking to replace the Great Western Forum for the Kings, and exercised an option to buy 25% of the Lakers, with the Lakers agreeing to become a tenant in the planned arena. Roski and Anschutz developed the Staples Center for both teams. During his minority ownership, the Lakers won NBA Championships in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2020; and the Kings won the Stanley Cup in 2012 and 2014. Roski proposed a stadium in the Los Angeles suburb of the City of Industry for a National Football League team. In 2010, the California legislature passed a bill that gave Roski an exemption to environmental review for the $800 million stadium proposal. The deal was not completed, due to the announcement of the SoFi Stadium instead. Roski was also part of a $1 billion project to build Allegiant Stadium for the relocated Oakland Raiders and the UNLV Rebels football teams, but later pulled out of the project.

Located in the Allston neighborhood of Boston, the Horace Mann School is a member of Boston Public Schools, and has a long history of providing education for Deaf and hard of hearing students. Founded in 1869, Boston School for the Deaf Mutes was established by the Boston School Committee. Renamed after Horace Mann, an advocate for oralism, in 1877, HMS has since occupied many different buildings in and around Boston. At the school‚Äôs opening in November 1869, one group of HMS students attended classes in the morning in an available space on East Street while a second group of learners attended afternoon classes in a space on Somerset Street. After only two months, HMS was relocated within Pemberton Square where morning and afternoon classes were held for all students in the same location. By 1875, the number of students attending Horace Mann School had increased and a larger space was required. As a result, the school was moved to 63 Warrenton Street. In 1890, the school was relocated again. From 1890-1929, HMS was located at 178 Newbury Street. After nearly forty years on Newbury Street, in 1929, Horace Mann School began to operate out of the Roxbury section of Boston on Kearsarge Avenue where it remained for the next forty-five years. Finally, in 1975, another building was selected to house the school. Since 1975 and for the last 42 years, Horace Mann School has been and is currently located at 40 Armington Street, Allston, MA. Several well-known historical figures such as Alexander Graham Bell and Helen Keller have been associated with Horace Mann School in its earlier years. The Horace Mann School currently serves students from age three to 22.

Career 1952 recording of \\"Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie\\" released as a Rainbow Records 78, 200. Cedrone was born in Jamesville, New York. Cedrone's musical career began in the 1940s, but he came into his own in the early 1950s, first as a session guitarist hired by what was then a country and western musical group based out of Chester, Pennsylvania called Bill Haley and His Saddlemen. In 1951, Cedrone played lead on their recording of \\"Rocket 88\\" which is considered one of the first acknowledged rock and roll recordings. At around this time, Cedrone formed his own group, The Esquire Boys and this is believed to be one of the reasons he never joined Haley's group as a full-time member. In 1952, Cedrone played lead guitar on Haley's version of \\"Rock the Joint\\", and his swift guitar solo, which combined a jazz-influenced first half followed by a lightning-fast down- scale run, was a highlight of the recording. (Haley's piano player, Johnny Grande, later described this solo as a \\"gimmick\\" that Cedrone often used.) Cedrone's involvement with the Esquire Boys kept him off of Haley's recording schedule for most of 1952 and 1953 (noted jazz guitarist Art Ryerson replaced him). During this time, Cedrone made a number of recordings with the Esquires, most notably two versions of the Bill Haley composition, \\"Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie\\", several years before Haley would record it himself. The first version was released in December, 1952 on Rainbow Records as 200. The Esquire Boys recorded a second version of \\"Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie\\" in 1954 released as Guyden 705-A, which reached no. 42 on the Cashbox pop singles chart on October 30, 1954. \\"Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie\\" would also be recorded by Bill Haley and the Comets in 1955 on Decca, Buddy Morrow on Mercury, Johnny Curtis with the Toppers on Tops, Gabe Drake and his Rockets with the Orchestra under Maury Laws on Prom 1135, Willie Restum and His Music on Capitol, the Deep River Boys on HMV in 1956, Ivor and the Basil Kirchin Band in the UK, Artie Malvin and the Rhythm Rockets on Waldorf Music Hall Records MH 33 149 in 1955 on the Rock and Roll album, Artie Malvin with the Deerhill Dudes on the Waldorf 33 BU 2 Rock 'N Roll Jamboree album in 1958, The Treniers on Okeh 7023, Truck Stop in 1973, Omar Lamparter, The Original Band, The Danish Sharks, The Jodimars in 1955 for Capitol which was unissued, and the Brian Setzer Orchestra in 2000. Cedrone returned to work with Haley's group in 1954, by which time it had been renamed The Comets. He played a key role in the band's first recording session for Decca Records on April 12, 1954 when they recorded \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" in New York City. According to the book Rock Around the Clock by Jim Dawson, Cedrone had been unable to attend the session rehearsal and was uncertain what to play for the first instrumental break in the song. One of the Comets (accounts differ as to exactly who) suggested Cedrone repeat the solo he'd played on \\"Rock the Joint\\". Although Danny's wife Millie and daughter Marie recall an informal rehearsal at their home in South Philadelphia after dinner where the two men ran through a few solos, and the Rock The Joint break was one of them. Cedrone was paid only $21 for his work on the session, as at that time Haley chose not to hire a full-time guitarist for his group. Cedrone would also play on the June 7, 1954 recording session for Haley's version of \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\" although he was not allotted the chance for another notable guitar solo. On June 17, ten days after this session, Cedrone died of a broken neck after falling down a staircase (some sources say he died of a heart attack). His place as session musician in the Comets was taken by Franny Beecher, who would later graduate to full Comets member. Eight months after Cedrone's death, \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" was included on the opening credits of the film Blackboard Jungle and became the first rock and roll recording to hit the top of the American charts. Subsequently the song was performed on TV many times by Haley and the Comets; on several occasions (depending upon the demands of the program) the band would lip-synch to the 1954 recording. As a result, footage exists of both Bill Haley (on The Milton Berle Show) and Franny Beecher (American Bandstand and the 1956 film, Rock Around the Clock) miming to Cedrone's original solo. Beecher, himself an acclaimed and respected guitarist, did not begin to actually emulate Cedrone's solo until as late as the 1980s. Up until that point, Beecher replaced the down-scale run that Cedrone used to conclude his \\"Clock\\" guitar solo with a series of fast arpeggios. Personal life and legacy Cedrone had four daughters with wife Millie. His family had attempted to get Cedrone named to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where his guitar has been on display in the Hall since 1998 (this is due to the Hall changing its rules a few years back to allow noted session musicians and backing groups to be admitted separately; previously only Bill Haley (not The Comets or individual members thereof) was a member of the Hall. Cedrone was finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Comets in 2012, by a special committee aiming to correct the mistake of not inducting the band with Bill Haley in 1987. Numerous guitar players over the years, including Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Chris Spedding, Brian Setzer, Danny Gatton, Reverend Horton Heat and the group Ten Years After have gone on record as naming Cedrone's solo on \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" as an influence on their own work. Recordings with Haley Although well- identified with Bill Haley & His Comets, Cedrone only appears on a handful of the group's recordings. This is a list of the known Haley recordings on which Cedrone is either believed to have performed or has been confirmed, including recordings when the band was known as the Saddlemen. Due to a lack of documentation, Cedrone's involvement in recordings from 1951‚Äì52 is not confirmed but is supported by anecdotal evidence from surviving musicians, as well as by books such as the Haley biographies Sound and Glory by John Haley and John von Hoelle and Bill Haley by John Swenson.

Located in the city's Belltown neighborhood, it is one of only three movie theaters in the world still capable of showing three- panel Cinerama films. History The Seattle Cinerama opened in 1963 as Seattle's Martin Cinerama as a showcase for the eponymous technology, but was retrofitted a few months later to also show 70 mm films on its huge curved screen. The movie house soon became specialized in showing such spectaculars as The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Both formats shortly fell out of fashion, and Krakatoa, East of Java from 1969 was the last non-standard film to be shown at the Cinerama in the first era of its existence. The following three decades were lean, as the proliferation of suburban multiplex theaters drew movie fans away from the Cinerama. Lackluster ticket sales quickly led to a general decline in the theater's upkeep, until it was relegated to playing second-run movies after being taken over by Cineplex Odeon on a reduced rent, month-to-month basis. =Major 1990s renovation= The turnaround began in 1997 when developers revealed plans to turn the Cinerama into a dinner theater or a rock-climbing club. This sparked a grassroots effort to save the historic venue, with local film buffs circulating petitions and issuing an urgent cry for help, which was answered by multi-billionaire Paul Allen, himself a movie fan and patron of the theater during its 1960s heyday. Allen purchased the theater and initiated a comprehensive, multimillion-dollar restoration. The grand re-opening occurred in 1999. Since then, the theater has played both classic movies and select new productions. The interior The renovation restored the look of a great mid-20th century movie house, and also saw the installation of state-of- the-art technology and accessibility features. The theater now contains 808 seats and two screens. The first is a deep curved 90-foot-long, 30-foot-high screen, constructed of 2,000 louvered strips. It is used for presenting rare three-strip films such as How the West Was Won and 70 mm classics like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The deep curve screen is stored in sections behind a smaller screen used for regular screenings of modern 70 mm/35 mm first-run movies. A professional crew is required to dismantle the smaller screen and assemble the larger one for Cinerama and special event presentations. =2010 renovation= The balcony The theater closed at the end of August 2010 for another round of renovations. During the closure, a new digital projection and sound system was added, including support for the screening of 3-D films. A new screen was also installed, the concessions area updated, new carpeting and paint, and a new marquee and signage outside. The theater is still able to present films in 70mm and three-panel Cinerama formats. =2014 renovation= The theater closed in August 2014 for yet another round of renovations. Three months later, on November 20, the theater re-opened for a screening of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 1. This fourth renovation of Cinerama saw a plethora of changes to the interior. Notably, the theater's capacity was reduced from 798 to 560 seats (a stated 390 on the Main Level and 170 in the Balcony, however only 546 tickets are generally available for purchase), allowing for more leg room and wider seats. The number of speakers was increased to 110 from the original 65, with some accompanying acoustical changes. A new projector, the Christie 6P laser projector, was outfitted into the auditorium as well. When purchasing a ticket you also now select a seat. = 2020 renovation = The Seattle Cinerama closed for a fourth renovation in February 2020, and all but two of its staff were laid off. Planned updates included new carpeting and kitchen equipment. A reopening date was expected to be within the 2020 calendar year. =2020 closure= In May of 2020, the Seattle Cinerama, citing the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, announced that it would remain closed for the foreseeable future. Festivals and events held at Cinerama In recent years, the Seattle Cinerama has hosted a number of festivals and events including: * Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF): Held annually since 1976, the theater has functioned as one of the festival's venues, most recently in 2015. * SFFSFF: The EMP Museum, in collaboration with SIFF, operates the annual festival showcasing animated and live-action science fiction, fantasy, and horror-tinged short film from around the globe at the theater. * Emerald City Comicon Cinema Series: Cinerama and the Emerald City Comicon have partnered since 2014 to bring together movie stars to talk about their films in Q&A; sessions. Notable attendees include Stan Lee, Alan Tudyk, Karl Urban and Michael Biehn. * Fists & Fury: Established in 2015, the inaugural mixed martial arts film festival featured rarely screened Bruce Lee titles such as Enter the Dragon and The Chinese Connection, as well as other popular films of the genre including Kill Bill: Volume 1, Kill Bill: Volume 2 and Kung Fu Hustle. * 70mm Film Fest: Run quasi-annually since the fall of 2011, the 70mm fest seeks to showcase the decaying large screen format. Titles include original 70mm classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Lawrence of Arabia and Tron as well as blow ups of 35mm productions like Life Force and new titles like The Master, Interstellar and The Hateful 8. The 70mm Film Festival was most recently held from September 7 - 20, 2018. Notable screenings 2001: A Space Odyssey had an exclusive run locally at Seattle Cinerama for nearly years following its original release in the fall of 1968. In 2001, Warner Brothers chose the Seattle Cinerama as the theater in which to premiere the newly restored 70mm print of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film opened on October 5, 2001, and eventually opened in other cities around North America the following month. In 2012, Paul Allen paid for a new 70mm print of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey to be produced for the first annual Cinerama Science Fiction Film Festival. Due to rights issues, the studios own the new print. It has, however, been placed on \\"permanent loan\\" to the Seattle Cinerama. 2013 introduced 2D Tuesdays: Beginning with The Great Gatsby on June 5, 2013, the theater began showing 2D versions of all 3D films every Tuesday. On the weekend of September 27 through 29, 2013 the Seattle Cinerama concluded the \\"Big Screen 70mm Festival\\" with a rare screening of original 3-strip Cinerama films, using the three projection booths. How the West Was Won played daily Friday thru Sunday, with a screening of This Is Cinerama on Saturday evening. March 25 through 31, 2016, the Cinerama was one of only ten theaters in the nation to show Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in 70mm for its first week. April 15 through 21, 2016, Quentin Tarantino's extended \\"70mm Roadshow\\" version of The Hateful Eight ran in Ultra Panavision 70. November 4 through 13, 2016, the Cinerama had a 10-day run of Mad Max: Fury Road Black and Chrome Edition.' November 17 through 24, 2016, the Cinerama was one of ten theaters in the country to debut Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in 70mm. Other Cinerama film venues In addition to the Seattle Cinerama, the two theaters in the world still capable of showing three-panel Cinerama films are the Cinerama Dome at ArcLight Cinemas in Los Angeles, and the Pictureville Cinema at the National Media Museum in Bradford, England.

She has previously operated under the names, Isle of Innisfree, then Pride of Cherbourg, Stena Challenger and Challenger. As of 2008, MV Kaitaki is the largest ferry providing the Interislander service between the North and South Islands of New Zealand having taken her latest name in 2007. KiwiRail, the operator of the Interislander ferries, bought the Kaitaki in 2017. History The ship was built at Van der Giessen de Noord shipyard in the Netherlands, and was launched in 1995 as the Isle of Innisfree for the Irish Ferries route between Holyhead and Dublin. She remained on that route for two years before being replaced by another vessel built by Van der Giessen de Noord, the Isle of Inishmore, which offered greater passenger and vehicle capacity. She then moved to the Pembroke Dock ‚Äì Rosslare route, replacing the 1981-built Isle of Inishturk, where she remained for four years before again being replaced by the Isle of Inishmore, which herself had been replaced by the Ulysses. Isle of Innisfree was initially sent to Dublin for lay up and then to Le Havre, where she remained until July 2002. In 2002 the Isle of Innisfree was chartered by P&O; Portsmouth and was sent to Falmouth in July of that year for refit. She emerged as Pride of Cherbourg, the third ship to carry this name. Extra cabins were installed on deck 7 to make her more suitable for the longer Portsmouth- Cherbourg crossing, but while in service with P&O; she was often criticized for not having enough cabins compared with the vessels she replaced. Pride of Cherbourg entered service in September 2002, replacing the second Pride of Le Havre, and operated alongside the Pride of Hampshire until the end of the month when she was also withdrawn. P&O; Portsmouth became part of P&O; Ferries at the end of that year, but the Pride of Cherbourg did not receive the new colours of the company until her refit in 2004, which also removed most traces of her Irish Ferries roots, moved the club lounge to aft on deck 7 and introduced the same brand names for the facilities as on the Dover ships. MV Kaitaki under her previous name MV Challenger in Wellington Harbour. On 28 September 2004 P&O; Ferries announced the withdrawal of all its Portsmouth services except to Bilbao. Pride of Cherbourgs last crossing for P&O; was on 14 January, from Cherbourg to Portsmouth. P&O; subchartered her to Stena Roro as a short-term replacement for , which was undergoing rebuilding work. Pride of Cherbourg sailed for Gda≈Ñsk, where all her exterior P&O; branding was removed and she was renamed Stena Challenger. The Stena Challenger sailed on Stena Line's Karlskrona‚ÄîGdynia service from February until June 2005. After completing her service with Stena Line she was sub-chartered again, to Interislander. Before leaving for New Zealand her name was shortened to Challenger, with its MƒÅori translation, Kaitaki, also appearing on its bow, being used for marketing purposes (the other two Interislander ferries at the time, Arahura and Aratere has MƒÅori names). In April 2007 the ship was officially renamed Kaitaki. Like the ‚ÄùKaiarahi‚Äù‚Äù she is an Interislander ferry without a rail deck for the transport of railway wagons. In 2009, it was announced that the initial five-year lease would be extended and that she would have to be returned to Stena Line on 30 June 2013. The lease has been renewed again on 16 April 2013 until 2017 with the option to extend another three years afterwards. In May 2017, it was revealed that KiwiRail had bought the Kaitaki.

It was officially introduced in the SQL:2003 standard, and expanded in the SQL:2008 standard. Usage MERGE INTO tablename USING table_reference ON (condition) WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET column1 = value1 [, column2 = value2 ...] WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (column1 [, column2 ...]) VALUES (value1 [, value2 ...]); A right join is employed over the Target (the INTO table) and the Source (the USING table / view / sub-query)--where Target is the left table and Source is the right one. The four possible combinations yield these rules: * If the ON field(s) in the Source matches the ON field(s) in the Target, then UPDATE * If the ON field(s) in the Source does not match the ON field(s) in the Target, then INSERT * If the ON field(s) does not exist in the Source but does exist in the Target, then no action is performed. * If the ON field(s) does not exist in either the Source or Target, then no action is performed. If multiple Source rows match a given Target row, an error is mandated by SQL:2003 standards. You cannot update a Target row multiple times with a MERGE statement Implementations Database management systems Oracle Database, DB2, Teradata, EXASOL, Firebird, CUBRID, HSQLDB, MS SQL, Vectorwise and Apache Derby support the standard syntax. Some also add non-standard SQL extensions. = Synonymous= Some database implementations adopted the term \\"Upsert\\" (a portmanteau of update and insert) to a database statement, or combination of statements, that inserts a record to a table in a database if the record does not exist or, if the record already exists, updates the existing record. This synonym is used in PostgreSQL (v9.5+)PostgreSQL-tutorial and SQLite (v3.24+).upsert sqlite.org visited 6-6-2018 It is also used to abbreviate the \\"MERGE\\" equivalent pseudo- code. It is used in Microsoft SQL Azure.Transact-SQL Reference (Database Engine): MERGE (Transact-SQL) =Other non-standard implementations= Some other database management systems support this, or very similar behavior, through their own, non-standard SQL extensions. MySQL, for example, supports the use of syntaxMySQL :: MySQL 5.1 Reference Manual :: 12.2.4.3 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Syntax which can be used to achieve a similar effect with the limitation that the join between target and source has to be made only on PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraints, which is not required in the ANSI/ISO standard. It also supports \`REPLACE INTO\` syntax,MySQL 5.1 Reference Manual: 11.2.6 REPLACE Syntax which first attempts an insert, and if that fails, deletes the row, if exists, and then inserts the new one. There is also an \`IGNORE\` clause for the \`INSERT\` statement, which tells the server to ignore \\"duplicate key\\" errors and go on (existing rows will not be inserted or updated, but all new rows will be inserted). SQLite's works similarly. It also supports \`REPLACE INTO\` as an alias for compatibility with MySQL. Firebird supports \`MERGE INTO\` though fails to throw an error when there are multiple Source data rows. Additionally there is a single-row version, , but the latter does not give you the option to take different actions on insert versus update (e.g. setting a new sequence value only for new rows, not for existing ones.) IBM DB2 extends the syntax with multiple \`WHEN MATCHED\` and \`WHEN NOT MATCHED\` clauses, distinguishing them with \`... AND some-condition\` guards. Microsoft SQL Server extends with supporting guards and also with supporting Left Join via clauses. PostgreSQL supports merging via .PostgreSQL INSERT page CUBRID supports \`MERGE INTO\` statement. And supports the use of syntax.CUBRID :: Data Manipulation Statements :: Insert :: ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Clause It also supports \`REPLACE INTO\` for compatibility with MySQL.CUBRID :: Data Manipulation Statements :: Replace Apache Phoenix supports \`UPSERT VALUES\` and \`UPSERT SELECT\` syntax. Usage in NoSQL A similar concept is applied in some NoSQL databases. E.g. in MongoDB the fields in a value associated with a key can be updated with an \`update\` operation. The \`update\` rasies an error if the key is not found. In the \`update\` operation it is possible to set the \`upsert\` flag: in this case a new value is stored associated to the given key if it does not exist, otherwise the whole value is replaced. In Redis the \`SET\` operations sets the value associated with a given key. Redis does not know any detail of the internal structure of the value, so an update would have no meaning. So the \`SET\` operation has always a set or replace semantics.

It is a suffragan see of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. The current bishop of the diocese is Bishop Jeffrey Monforton. The seat for the diocese is Holy Name Cathedral in Steubenville. History Pope Pius XII erected the diocese on October 21, 1944, in territory separated from the Diocese of Columbus. In 2007, Bishop R. Daniel Conlon announced the Diocese would begin to raise funds to construct a new cathedral, Triumph of the Cross, in the West End of Steubenville, near Steubenville Catholic Central High School. The plan entailed combining six parishes in the city (Holy Name Cathedral, Holy Rosary, St. Pius X, St. Anthony's, St. Stanislaus, and Servants of Christ the King) into a centrally‚Äìlocated Cathedral to better accommodate smaller numbers of parishioners in the area and of ordained priests in the Diocese. The six individual parishes forming Triumph of the Cross parish closed June 8, 2008. After raising $8.5 million, Conlon shelved his plan in November 2011 saying that it was far too risky to incur the debt that construction would require. In June 2013, Conlon's successor, Bishop Jeffrey Monforton, announced that the diocese would retain the current cathedral and renovate it to meet the challenges of the region. His plan included upgraded technology to allow broadcast of Masses and other events to those unable to attend, installing security systems to allow 24-hour visitation and restoring the towers which were removed in a 1957 renovation. He added that when possible, the diocese would employ local residents and firms to perform work and that the diocese would work with nearby Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church and the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County to revitalize the neighborhood. =Sex Abuse= On October 31, 2018, the Diocese of Steubenville unveiled a list of 16 clergy and one seminarian who were either credibly accused of or had admitted to sexually abusing minors.https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/10/31/steubenville-diocese- priests-accused-sexual-abuse/https://www.wtrf.com/community/diocese-of- steubenville-releases-names-of-16-accused-priests-one-seminarian/ In November 2018, Diocese of Steubenville priest Henry Christopher Foxhoven, 45, of Glouster, Ohio plead guilty to three counts of sexually battery involving a female minor.https://wtov9.com/news/local/former-catholic-priest-in-the- diocese-of-steubenville-sentenced-for-sexual-miscconduct As a result of his plea agreement, Foxhoven, who also impregnated his altar girl victim,https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/ohio-priest-arrested-accused-of- impregnating-17-year-old-altar-girl was sentenced to 12 years in prison and cannot seek an early release.

Green  Involvement in schools  Civitas provides teaching materials and guest speakers for schools, in particular on family structure and on the EU. The EU project publishes a series of free factsheets on the European Union, designed for use by A-level students. Civitas also arranges speakers for talks and debates in schools on the subject of the EU. Civitas runs supplementary schools on Saturday mornings and after school hours. The schools teach English and maths to children from disadvantaged backgrounds, emphasising traditional approaches such as phonics. There are now twenty supplementary schools in King's Cross, Hammersmith, Camberwell, Keighley, Birmingham, Great Yarmouth and Bradford providing classes for over 600 children per week. Civitas is adapting the American Core Knowledge curriculum for the UK. It is a year-by-year outline of the specific and shared content and skills to be taught in Years 1 to 6. The first Core Knowledge book, What Your Year 1 Child Needs to Know, aroused controversy over its message to minorities when released in 2011.English version of US fact bible for Year 1s hits the shops at the Times Educational Supplement The books for Year 1 and Year 2 were published in 2012.  Funding  Civitas has been rated as 'highly opaque' in its funding by Transparify and has been a given a E grade for funding transparency by Who Funds You?. Its funders include the pro-free market Nigel Vinson Charitable Trust.  Controversies  In 2004, a Civitas report was criticised by Faisal Islam for its deceptive methodology on the costs of immigration. A 2005 report by Civitas finding Britain's police forces to be among the least effective in the developed world \\"provoked outrage... among chief constables and criminologists.\\" It was also criticised by the UK's policing think tank the Police Foundation and the UK Home Office. A 2013 report by Civitas, written by the director of the pro-fossil fuel Renewable Energy Foundation, argued that a shift to renewables would mean ‚Äúmore people would be working for lower wages in the energy sector, energy costs would rise, the economy would stagnate, and there would be a significant decline in the standard of living‚Äù. The Government dismissed his report as ‚Äúa manifesto for locking the British economy into excessive reliance on imported gas‚Äù.

The site was submitted to the list of tentative World Heritage sites under criteria I, III and IV on June 18, 2001, by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. Etymology The name \\"Abila\\" is derived from the Semitic word Abel (in Hebrew, \\"meadow\\" and in Arabic, \\"green growth\\"). The largest site is located amidst verdant agricultural fields near the modern spring. Roman temples, Byzantine churches and early mosques lie amidst olive groves and wheat fields. The name of the south hill, Umm al-Amad, means \\"Mother of the Columns\\", where large columns can be found. Geology The natural stone of the Transjordan region is beds of limestone and chalky limestone laid down in marine deposits in the Eocene and raised above sea level as the Belqa Group in the middle Eocene. Their relatively soft stone is extensively transected by eroded wadis and is covered by meters of erosional soil termed terra rossa The Abila site is covered by approximately a meter of another, closely related soil, Rendzina. Both soils are fertile, contributing to the agriculture and arboriculture of the area. Topography and spatial evolution Tell Umm al- Amad is also termed Khirbet Umm al-Amad, where khirbet is \\"ruined settlement.\\" As the wadi is aligned north-south at that location, Tell Umm al-Amad is dubbed \\"the south tell.\\" The unit of north and south tells create a defensible elevation similar to an acropolis surrounded on three sides by wadis. Tell in Arabic means only \\"hill\\", and the archaeological connotation of \\"hill of accumulated debris\\" in this case does not apply, as the city was built over two natural hills on the left bank of Wadi (\\"valley\\") Qweilibeh.. Its area is delineated by hills and escarpments. The presence of a city wall first constructed in the Iron Age and enhanced under the Macedonians and Romans defined the defensible part of the settlement. In shape the walled city at its peak was an elongated rectangle beginning on the stream-facing slope of Tell Abila and slanting across the depression between the two hills to end at the summit of the south hill. The archaeology bears out that the settlement on the north hill was the original Abila. Most of the city was in the saddle-shaped surface between the two hills. The slopes were overcome by terracing the saddle. However defensible, a city on a hill could not exist without native water and food supplies. History and archaeology The site was in use from the Neolithic period until the Abbasid/Fatimid and Ayyubid/Mamluk periods, though its use in these later periods was limited. The excavations have shown habitation at Abila from c. 4000 BCE to 1500 CE, and have yielded numerous artifacts, and unearthed remains of city walls, a temple, a large theatre, a nymphaeum, and a sixth-century church. The first known European to visit the site was Ulrich Jasper Seetzen in 1806. G. Schumacher has given a protracted description of the site, in his work Abilah of the Decapolis, published by the Palestine Exploration Fund.Schumacher (1889), pp. 332‚Äìff. The ruins have been described in published literature as early as 1889 by Guy Le Strange. The site has been extensively excavated since 1980. While several of its ancient structures have been excavated including aqueducts, tombs, gates and public buildings, much of it remains unexcavated, yet visible at the surface. =Bronze Age= Abila possibly appears in one of the 14th century BC Amarna letters as Ia-bi-li-ma. =Iron Age= The first city wall was built during the Iron Age. =Hellenistic period= Polybius and Josephus mention the capture of the Ptolemaic city by the Seleucid king Antiochus III in 218 BCE. Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus (r. 103-76 BCE) conquered Abila during his expansion wars. =Roman period= Abila was taken by Roman general Pompey in 63 BCE and granted independence. In the ensuing Roman and Byzantine periods, Abila reached a position of regional importance. Abila was part of the Hellenistic city league known as the Decapolis, as proven by an inscription from the time of Emperor Hadrian (r. 117‚Äì138), in spite of it missing from the list given by Pliny. Archaeological evidence, including a temple, coins, and bullae, suggests that several deities were particularly worshipped at Abila, mainly Herakles, possibly in a syncretic form as Herakles-Malqart, combined with iconographic aspects of Dionysus; as well as Tyche and Athena.Achim Lichtenberger, The Decapolis and Phoenicia, ARAM Periodical 23 (January 2011), pp. 559-583, DOI: 10.2143/ARAM.23.0.2959673, retrieved 19 December 2019 Rock- cut tombs from the 2nd-3rd centuries discovered nearby partly display elaborate mural paintings. =Byzantine and Early Muslim periods= Sixth century church found on Tell Abila Abila continued to thrive in the Byzantine period and became a prominent regional Christian centre, as proven by the presence of several large churches. Further evidence has shown that the site was used for Christian worship from at least the seventh- to eighth-century. Destruction visited upon the city by either war (the conquest by Persian armies in 614) or the earthquake of 633 led to a period of abandonment. The site was again inhabited in the Umayyad period, when a large building was erected over the ruins of the theatre. There was repeated destruction caused by the 749 earthquake. Bishopric Abila was a Christian episcopal see and, since it was part of the late Roman province of Palaestina Secunda, it is distinguished from another town and bishopric of the same name in the province of Phoenicia by being called Abila in Palaestina. The names of three of its bishops are given in extant contemporary documents. In 518, Solomon signed the synodal letter of Patriarch John of Jerusalem Severus of Antioch. Nicostratus signed the acts of the synod of the three Palestine provinces that Patriarch Peter called in 536 against Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople. Alexander was deposed in 553 for refusing to sign the decisions of a council of Jerusalem against the Origenists; exiled to Constantinople, he died there in an earthquake in 557.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. III, coll. 701-704Sim√©on Vailh√©, v. 1. Abila, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques, vol. I, Paris 1909, col. 120 No longer a residential bishopric, Abila is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 822 Ecological threats The main threats to the site have been identified as development pressures, insufficient management, unsustainable tourism, water erosion (rain and spring). Both urban and agricultural development pressures are increasing in the area, due to its fertile soil, gentle climate and water availability. Tourism is unmonitored and there are little interpretation and no facilities provided for tourists. The site is not expected to be a large tourism draw given its proximity to the more popular Umm Qais site.

Background Robin Blencoe had been a minister of the British Columbia government for several years when Fran Yanor went public with a claim of sexual harassment and filed to the British Columbia Human Rights Council (later the British Columbia Human Rights Commission). Several months later two other women filed complaints for sexual harassment. Due to delays to the tribunal hearings the claims were not resolved for 30 months after the first filing in 1995. During this time Blencoe was subjected to vast media coverage that contributed to the ruin of his career, and to his and his family's social and psychological hardship. Judicial history Blencoe challenged the delay of the Human Rights Commission in the British Columbia Supreme Court on the basis of denial of natural justice. The court dismissed his challenge. Blencoe appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the basis that the delay of the hearing for over 30 months was a violation of his right to \\"security of person\\" under section 7 of the Charter. The Court found in favour of Blencoe and ordered the charges against him to be stayed. The Court held that the delay stigmatized him and caused undue harm to him and his family, which violated his rights under section 7 of the Charter. The issues appealed to the Supreme Court were: # Whether the delay violated Blencoe's section 7 rights. # Whether the delay violated the administrative law rule against undue delay. In a five-to-four decision, the Court overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal, and held that the delay did not violate the Charter or administrative law. Reasons of the court Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, dismissed Blencoe's claim and held that the tribunal should proceed. =Section 7= Justice Bastarache examines the applicability of section 7. He finds that section 7 can extend \\"beyond the sphere of criminal law, at least where there is 'state action which directly engages the justice system and its administration'.\\"para. 46 The process of analyzing section 7, states Bastarache, has two steps. First, it must be determined if there has been a violation of life, liberty, or security of person. Second, the violation must be shown to be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice. Bastarache examined the meaning of \\"liberty\\" and \\"security of person\\". \\"Liberty\\", he argues, is related to personal autonomy. It is \\"engaged where state compulsions or prohibitions affect important and fundamental life choices.\\" \\"Security of person\\" concerns psychological harm. It must be established that the state caused actual psychological harm, and that there have been serious injuries. Considering Blencoe's claims, Bastarache found that there was no violation of liberty as the delay did not affect any fundamental life choices. There was also no violation of security of person as the harm was caused by the accusations not by the delay itself, which did not have much effect one way or another. =Administrative delay= The issue identified by Bastarache was \\"whether the delay in this case could amount to a denial of natural justice even where the respondent's ability to have a fair hearing has not been compromised.\\" He dismissed the possibility that the trial was not fair as he saw no evidence to suggest that Blencoe was not able to provide a full answer and defence. Bastarache considered whether the delay violated natural justice by causing serious harm to Blencoe. He found that the harm only amounted to personal hardship and was not serious. He then considered whether the delay violated natural justice by bringing the Human Rights Commission into disrepute. The Court noted that many of the delays were contributed to by Blencoe or consented to by him. Consequently, the Commission was not brought into disrepute. Dissent Justice LeBel, in dissent, held that there was a violation of administrative law; however, he did not consider this to be a Charter issue.

The Stoa of the Athenians is an ancient portico in the Delphic Sanctuary, Greece, located south of the Temple of Apollo. The southern side of the polygonal wall of the platform forms the north wall of the stoa. It was constructed c. 478 BC-470 BC during the early Classical period. The one-aisled stoa with Ionic colonnade opens toward the southeast. It was dedicated by the Athenians after the Persian Wars. Description of the Stoa The Stoa of the Athenians is built against the polygonal wall supporting the terrace of the temple of Apollo. The monument has been identified through the inscription of the stylobate: ŒëŒ§ŒóŒïŒùŒëŒôŒüŒô ŒëŒùŒïŒòŒïŒ£ŒëŒù Œ§ŒóŒù Œ£Œ§ŒüŒëŒù ŒöŒëŒô Œ§Œë ŒüŒ†Œõ[Œë Œö]ŒëŒô Œ§ŒëŒöŒ°ŒüŒ§ŒïŒ°ŒôŒë ŒïŒõŒüŒùŒ§ŒïŒ£ Œ§Œ©Œù Œ†ŒüŒõŒïŒúŒôŒ©Œù [The Athenians dedicated the portico and the armaments and the figure heads of the ships that they seized from their enemies]. The \\"armaments\\" mentioned in the inscription refer probably to ropes taken from Persian ships, quite possibility the ropes they used to build their extensive pontoon bridge across the Hellespont.Umholz, G., ‚ÄúArchitraval Arrogance? Dedicatory Inscriptions in Greek Architecture of the Classical Period‚Äù, Hesperia 71, 2002, 261-293. On a three-stepped stylobate measuring 26.5 meters long and 3.10 meters wide stand seven monolithic fluted columns of the Ionic order. They are made of Pentelic marble and their bases are made of Paros marble. They are 3.31 meters high. The distance between them is quite large, thus creating openings allowing ample light to enter the building, which was probably covered with a wooden roof. The stylobate and the colonnade have been restored and are extant today in situ. On the polygonal wall at the back of the stoa, particularly on the western part, have been carved about six hundred manumission inscriptions, in the form of fictitious sale of slaves to the god. Most probably, the portico was constructed after the naval victories against the Persians at Mykale and Sestos in 478 B.C.Walsh, J., ¬´ The Date of the Athenian Stoa at Delphi¬ª, AJA 90, 1986, 319-336. It was used for storing the war spoils, mainly from naval victories against the Persians. War spoils from naval battles at Mykale, Sestos, Salamis and the Hellespont were included.  Background  The remains of the Stoa of the Athenians were discovered by Bernard Haussoullier in 1880. The stoa was constructed in Delphi after the naval victory over the Persians at Sestus near the Hellespont in 478 BC. It was dedicated to Apollo, and the Athenians that perished in the Persian War. On display in the stoa were armaments taken from the vast pontoon bridge the Persians had built across the Hellespont at the beginning of the Persian War (480). The Persian King Xerxes had ordered the construction of the bridges to expedite the movement of his enormous forces across the straight. It was built by lashing together ships with ropes and setting planks on them.In 479 the Athenians attacked the last remnants of Persians on the Greek side of the Hellespont at Sestos. After they defeated them at the end of a long siege in 478, the Athenians and islanders dismantled the boat bridges, bringing home some of the cables the Persians had used to lash the boats together.In the following years, more exhibits were put on display in the Athenian stoa at Delphi, as the Athenians gained more naval victories. The war memorials on display were dedicated to Apollo, but they also served as monuments of Athens victory. Of the entire stoa, only the rear polygonal wall, stylobate, and northeast foundations, with a few columns remain today. Another view of the rear wall and remaining columns from the Stoa at Delphi  Design  A stoa is a portico consisting of a back wall and a colonnade in front supporting a roof. The Stoa of the Athenians at Delphi used a pre-existing wall, the Polygonal Wall, which dates to about 560 B.C., as its back wall, which was serving as the retaining wall for the terrace supporting the Temple of Apollo just to the north. The Stoa of the Athenians was built with a wooden, shedded roof with hipped ends, a wooden entablature, and seven marble columns set apart from each other at a distance of 3.58-meters. At their base, the columns were .39-meter in diameter. Unlike most stoas, the columns of the Stoa of the Athenians were marble and executed in the Ionic, not Doric style. Three nearly complete columns have been set up on the modern archaeological site, along with the fragment of a fourth. Although the rafters were never recovered, evidence suggests that they spanned across the roof at 3.5-meter intervals.

Here, signs and images do not faithfully show us reality, but might hint at the existence of something real which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.Baudrillard 1994 [1981], Simulacra and Simulation, University of Michigan Press, p.6 While the first-order simulacra is a faithful copy to the original and the third order are symbols that have become without referents, that is, symbols with no real object to represent but pretends to be a faithful copy of an original. Simply put, a third-order simulacra are symbols in themselves taken for reality and further layer of symbolism is added. This occurs when the symbol is taken to be more important or authoritative of the original entity, authenticity has been replaced by copy (thus reality is replaced by a substitute). The consequence of the propagation of second-order simulacra is that, within the affected context, nothing is \\"real,\\" though those engaged in the illusion are incapable of seeing it. Instead of having experiences, people observe spectacles, via real or metaphorical control screens. Instead of the real, we have simulation and simulacra, the hyperreal. In his essay \\"The Precession of the Simulacra,\\" Baudrillard recalls a tale from a short story by Borges in which a king requests a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical concept of map‚Äìterritory relation. Baudrillard argues that in the postmodern epoch, the territory ceases to exist, and there is nothing left but the map; or indeed, the very concepts of the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased. Among the many issues associated with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become \\"the silent majority,\\" an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that moral universalism (human rights, equality) is equated with globalization, which is not concerned with immutable values but with mediums of exchange and equalisation such as the global market and mass media.

As of March 1, 2008, it has 10 elementary schools (McGrath Elementary (awarded a 2011 Blue Ribbon), Meadows Elementary, Newhall Elementary, Oak Hills Elementary, Old Orchard Elementary, Peachland Elementary, Pico Canyon Elementary, Stevenson Ranch Elementary, Valencia Valley Elementary and Wiley Canyon Elementary). The superintendent is Jeff Pelzel. History The first school in the district was Newhall Elementary. The school opened its doors in 1876, near the current location of the Saugus Cafe. The school is named for Henry Mayo Newhall, as is the town. The school and the town of Newhall moved two years later, to a location 2 miles south of its original location. An oil boom in the Santa Clarita Valley brought the families of 53 students to area and the school was placed where the current Valencia Marketplace (Target store) currently stands. One year later, in 1879, a proper school house was built at the corner of 9th and Walnut streets, in the current town of Newhall. The building was a wooden, two-story building. The second story was used on weekends, for Sunday school classes. This original building succumbed to a fire in 1890. A new two-story school was built on the same site as the first two-story building. Those students who continued on to high school faced a long horseback ride to San Fernando High School, in the San Fernando Valley, once that school was built in 1896. In 1914, fire struck Newhall Elementary School again. Another building was built at the N.W. corner of Lyons and Newhall Ave. The older students were able to catch a ride in a converted automobile to San Fernando High School. In 1932, an actual bus was purchased. As the town grew, so did its school-aged population. The schoolhouse at Lyons and Newhall Ave. was not able to be expanded and so a new school was built in 1928 at the corner of 11th and Walnut streets. Fire hit the school again in 1939; however, the school was rebuilt where it stood. The school re-opened in 1940. This is the current location of Newhall Elementary School (2012). As for the older students, they would continue to travel until 1945 when Hart High School opened its doors. The original grades were 9th‚Äì12th. In 1948, the 7th and 8th graders moved to Hart High School. Hart High stayed a 7th‚Äì12th grade school until Placerita Junior High School opened its doors in 1961. The second school to be added to the Newhall School District was Peachland Elementary School which opened its doors in 1959. The third school to be added was Wiley Canyon Elementary School which opened in 1966. On January 13, 1945, the California State Board of Education approved the petitions of five Santa Clarita Valley school districts ‚Äî Newhall, Saugus, Castaic, Mint Canyon and Sulphur Springs ‚Äî to form the \\"Santa Clarita Union High School District.\\" Two weeks later, on January 29, local voters approved a bond measure to build the valley's first high school on a 27-acre parcel on Newhall Avenue, just down the street from Newhall School (Hart High School). The first Hart District school board was composed of school board members from each of the elementary districts. Tom Frew III and S.S. Donaldson represented the Newhall district. Donaldson was a sitting Newhall school board member, while Frew had already retired from a lengthy tenure on the Newhall board which included several years as president.

She entered service across Cook Strait between Wellington and Picton in late 1983 and was retired from the Interislander fleet in July 2015. History Arahura - First Voyage (1983) Arahura was built for the New Zealand Railways Corporation to cross Cook Strait, replacing the ageing and . She was designed to operate at a faster service speed than the previous ferries on the route, while reducing waves that would affect nearby beaches. This reduced the crossing time by 20 minutes. This was the second inter-island ferry to bear the name Arahura (a MƒÅori word meaning \\"Pathway to Dawn\\"). The earlier vessel was a twin-screw steamship built for the Union Steamship Company in 1905. That ship served until the early 1950s and was sunk by the RNZAF as target practice. In 1986, Arahura helped rescue passengers from the sinking Russian cruise liner , providing lifeboats and extra assistance. On 11 April 1989, Arahura rolled to 40 degrees during a routine sailing from Picton to Wellington because of stormy conditions in Cook Strait. In 2008, Arahura underwent a $NZ9 million refit to better accommodate larger trucks and campervans. This included reducing some of the upper decks and installing a new cinema and cafeteria. In 2014, she made her 50,000th Cook Strait crossing. In December 2014, Interislander announced that Arahura would be retired in 2015 after 32 years in service. Kaiarahi, the former was chartered to replace her on the route. Arahuras last scheduled passenger voyages were on 29 July 2015, operating the 14:45 sailing to Picton and the 18:45 sailing to Wellington. The last freight journey took place over the following night. She had completed more than 52,000 crossings and 13 million km with 4 million passengers carried. On 3 October 2015,Stuff.co - Overseas buyer snaps up ex-Interislander ferry Arahura renamed Ahura and with her Interislander livery painted out, she departed Wellington, bound for the Alang scrapyard in India, being beached there on 3 November. Scrapping was completed in late January 2016. =Livery= Arahura changed liveries three times in her lifetime. Originally, she had a green hull and buff, red, and black on the funnel (a modified 1970s NZR logo). In 1989, the inter-island service was re-branded as a \\"ferry cruise\\", and the livery of all the ferries was replaced with a white hull with blue and green stripes. The funnels now carried a stylized 'Pelorus Jack', a dolphin famous for assisting vessels navigating across the Cook Strait. The liveries were changed again in 2004. Pelorus Jack was relocated to the hull and the funnels were now blue with a fern replacing Pelorus Jack.center Propulsion Arahura was a diesel-electric vessel. She had a fuel capacity of 450,000 litres and was built with the capability to provide power ashore for civil defence or similar emergencies providing 14 MW power - enough to light all the houses in Wellington.

It went on to become one of the most influential and prolific firms of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. They made formative additions to the campuses of Bryn Mawr College, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Washington University in St. Louis.Cope & Stewardson at Washington University in St. Louis They also designed nine cottages and an administrative building at the Sleighton School, which showed their adaptability to other styles, because their buildings here were Colonial Revival with Federal influences. In 1912, the firm was succeeded by Stewardson and Page formed by Emlyn Stewardson and George Bispham Page.Stewardson and Page (fl. 1912‚Äì1936)  Style and influence  Alfred C. Harrison Building, Philadelphia (1894-95, demolished 1969). Although Walter Cope and John Stewardson were major exponents of the Collegiate Gothic style which swept campuses across the country in the latter part of the nineteenth century, they were equally adept at other styles. Their first important commission was the main YMCA for Richmond, Virginia (1885‚Äì87), designed in a Richardsonian Romanesque style. Their earliest major Collegiate Gothic building was Radnor Hall at Bryn Mawr College (1886), where, ironically, they replaced Cope's mentor Addison Hutton as campus architects. Commissions shortly followed for buildings on the campuses of the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Washington University in St. Louis (serving as administrative buildings for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair). Although these academic buildings were their hallmark, other projects included residential, commercial, institution, and industrial buildings. The firm designed Philadelphia buildings for the Harrison brothers, heirs to an enormous sugar- refining fortune. The Charles Custis Harrison Building (1893‚Äì94) was a Richardsonian Romanesque office building at 10th and Market Streets.Charles C. Harrison Building from HABS. It was demolished in 1979 to build The Gallery at Market East, an urban shopping mall. Directly north of it was the Harrison Stores (1893‚Äì94), a block-long commercial building and warehouse. This burned in 1984 during a renovation, and was demolished. The Alfred Craven Harrison Building (1894‚Äì95) was a chateauesque hotel and office tower at the southwest corner of 15th and Market Streets, opposite Broad Street Station. Demolished in 1969, the site is now occupied by the Centre Square Building and Claes Oldenburg's Clothespin. Charles Custis Harrison became provost of the University of Pennsylvania in 1894, and immediately removed Frank Furness as unofficial campus architect, replacing him with Cope & Stewardson.George E. Thomas, et al., Frank Furness: The Complete Works (Princeton University Press, 1996), pp. 54-55. Under Harrison, the university embarked on the biggest building boom in its history, with Cope & Stewardson designing the mammoth Quadrangle dormitories and new buildings for the engineering school, medical school, dental school, veterinary school, law school, zoological labs and English department - most clad in Collegiate Gothic. The firm also collaborated with architects Wilson Eyre and Frank Miles Day on the initial phases of the Arts & Crafts-style University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (1895‚Äì99). As important as their contribution to the architecture of Philadelphia and its environs is the role which Cope & Stewardson played in architectural education. Great numbers of young apprentices and would-be architects passed their days of training in the office, making it a general stopping place for many architects who would later become famous in their own right. In 1923 the annual T-Square club exhibition catalog published a photograph of the Cope & Stewardson office from about 1899. Included in the number of partners and younger architects are: Walter Cope; John A. MacMahon; James O. Betelle (later of Newark, NJ); Emlyn Stewardson; S. A. Cloud; Wetherill P. Trout; Herbert C. Wise; James P. Jamieson; Eugene S. Powers; E. Perot Bissell; Louise Stavely; Charles H. Bauer (later in Newark, NJ); William Woodburn Potter; John Molitor, Camillo Porecca; and C. Wharton Churchman. Walter Cope (1860‚Äì1902) In 1860, Walter Cope was born in Philadelphia to Thomas P. Cope and Elizabeth Waln Stokes Cope. After graduating from the Germantown Friends School, he attended classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1883. In 1885 the firm of Cope & Stewardson was established. Cope was a founding member of the T-Square Club in 1883 and later served as vice-president, secretary, treasurer, president, and as a member of the executive committee. He was also a Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania from 1892 to 1902. After teaching at Penn, he became a Professor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He died after suffering a stroke in 1902. Cope was also part of the investigating committee appointed to study conditions governing the new State Capitol Building competition in 1901. From 1896 to 1898 he was chairman of the committee on the restoration of Independence Hall. John Stewardson (1858‚Äì1896) John Stewardson, son of Thomas and Margaret Haines Stewardson, was born in 1858. His early education had been in private Christian schools in the Philadelphia area. He continued his studies at Adams Academy in Quincy, Massachusetts, from 1873 to 1877. After graduation, he entered Harvard College, but left in 1878. He briefly continued his studies at the University of Pennsylvania and then joined the Atelier Pascal in Paris, France. In 1882 he returned to Philadelphia, working first in T. P. Chandler's office and then in the office of Frank Furness. In 1884 he returned to Europe to travel through Italy and Belgium. A year later, he joined in personal practice with Walter Cope. They were joined in 1887 by John's younger brother Emlyn L. Stewardson, who had recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in civil engineering. In 1892, Stewardson joined the University of Pennsylvania as staff lecturer in their new School of Architecture. He was also one of the founding members of the T-Square Club, serving in 1885 and 1891 as president of that organization. He also served as treasurer of the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1886. He is credited with the taste for English Gothic Revival which Cope & Stewardson used in their collegiate buildings. Talbot Hamlin, in his biographical description, for the Dictionary of American Biography notes that, following Stewardson's trip to England in 1894, the buildings at the University of Pennsylvania, which were on the boards at the time, changed from stone structures to brick with stone trim. Stewardson died in 1896 after a skating accident on the Schuylkill River, where he had gone for an afternoon's outing with his friend, the architect Wilson Eyre. Following his funeral his fellow architects established a fund, now known as the prestigious Stewardson Fellowship, which is awarded annually to promising young architects from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to study architecture abroad. He is interred with a modest marker at Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery, Section 14, Plots 235&236. Selected Buildings Radnor Hall, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania (1887).

The title score was composed by music director Anil Biswas.

When she looks forward to a brand new life, she discovers that she is pregnant. Being tortured by the thought of an abortion and unable to contact Sam, Joey finds herself becoming delusional and emotionally unstable. Joey begins to see the spirits of dead people, and also feels stalked by a mysterious ghost woman. She believes the ghost wants to hurt her unborn baby. As the story unfolds, it is discovered that the ghost is Sam's wife who committed suicide by jumping in front of an oncoming train. She is now awaiting Joey's baby's birth so that she may be reincarnated within her. After discovering this, Joey would rather kill herself and her baby than let this woman become her child. While in a hospital, awaiting the birth of her child, Joey jumps off the building twice, but survives both times. She gives birth in the end realizing the terms with her situation.

Its task was to lay a series of supply depots across the Great Ice Barrier from the Ross Sea to the Beardmore Glacier, along the polar route established by earlier Antarctic expeditions. The expedition's main party, under Shackleton, was to land near Vahsel Bay on the opposite coast of Antarctica, and to march across the continent via the South Pole to the Ross Sea. As the main party would be unable to carry sufficient fuel and supplies for the whole distance, their survival depended on the Ross Sea party setting up supply depots, which would cover the final quarter of their journey. Shackleton set sail from London on his ship Endurance, bound for the Weddell Sea in August 1914. Meanwhile, the Ross Sea party personnel gathered in Australia, prior to departure for the Ross Sea in the second expedition ship, SY Aurora. Organisational and financial problems delayed their start until December 1914, which shortened their first depot-laying season. After their arrival the inexperienced party struggled to master the art of Antarctic travel, in the process losing most of their sled dogs. A greater misfortune occurred at the onset of the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then took the ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore, and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly, the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party. Despite these setbacks, the Ross Sea party survived inter- personnel disputes, extreme weather, illness, and the deaths of three of its members to carry out its mission in full during its second Antarctic season. This success proved ultimately without purpose, because Shackleton's main expedition was unable to land after Endurance was crushed in the Weddell Sea ice. Shackleton eventually led his men to safety, but the transcontinental march did not take place and the Ross Sea party's depots were not required. The Ross Sea party remained stranded until January 1917, when Aurora, which had been repaired and refitted in New Zealand, arrived to rescue them. Public recognition of their efforts was slow in coming, but in due course four Albert Medals were awarded to members of the party, two posthumously. Shackleton later wrote that those who died \\"gave their lives for their country as surely as those who gave up their lives in France or Flanders.\\"Shackleton (1919), p. 340  Background  After the conquest of the South Pole by Roald Amundsen in December 1911 Shackleton, who had sought this achievement himself, was forced to rethink his polar ambitions. He believed that there remained \\"one great main objective of Antarctic journeyings‚Äîthe crossing of the South Polar continent from sea to sea.\\"Shackleton (1919), Preface pp. xi‚Äìxv Basing his strategy on plans developed earlier by the Scottish explorer William Spiers Bruce, Shackleton planned to land with his main party as far south as possible, on the Weddell Sea coast.Huntford, p. 367 His transcontinental team would then march southward to the Pole, before continuing across the polar plateau and descending via the Beardmore Glacier (which Shackleton had discovered in 1909) to the Great Ice Barrier. The final stretch would take them across the Barrier to McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea coast. Shackleton estimated that the crossing would cover approximately , a distance too great for his party to carry all its supplies. In support of the main journey, therefore, a separate Ross Sea party would land in McMurdo Sound and would lay a series of supply depots across the width of the Barrier, to assist the crossing group home. It would also carry out scientific investigations. Shackleton described the depot-laying as vital to the success of the whole undertaking, but believed it would not present any great difficulties in execution.Shackleton (1919) pp. 241‚Äì42 He would later provide the leader of his Ross Sea support party with conflicting instructions on the task; stating on one hand it was of \\"supreme importance\\" to have the depots laid, but on the other that he would be carrying what he described as \\"sufficient provisions and equipment\\" to cross Antarctica to McMurdo Sound. In a letter of 18 September 1914 Shackleton stated that he did not want his support party to \\"have the anxiety of feeling\\" that he was absolutely dependent on the depots ‚Äì \\"in case some very serious accident\\" incapacitated the depot-laying.McOrist, p. 34 The Ross Sea party's vessel would be SY Aurora, a ship recently used by Douglas Mawson and the Australasian Antarctic Expedition.  Personnel  Ross Sea party members: Back row from left: Joyce, Hayward, Cope, Spencer-Smith. Centre: Mackintosh third from left, Stenhouse fourth from left To lead the Ross Sea party Shackleton chose Aeneas Mackintosh, having first attempted to persuade the Admiralty to provide him with a naval crew.Huntford, p. 371 Mackintosh, like Shackleton, was a former Merchant Navy officer, who had been on the Nimrod expedition until his participation was cut short by an accident that resulted in the loss of his right eye.Shackleton (1911), pp. 52‚Äì53 Another Nimrod veteran, Ernest Joyce, whose Antarctic experiences had begun with Captain Scott's Discovery Expedition, was appointed to take charge of sledging and dogs. Joyce was described by Shackleton's biographer, Roland Huntford, as \\"a strange mixture of fraud, flamboyance and ability\\",Huntford, p. 194 but his depot-laying work during the Nimrod expedition had impressed Shackleton.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 21‚Äì22 On Nimrod, Joyce led the team that laid vital supplies for Shackleton's returning southern party, and Shackleton said \\"Joyce knows his work well\\".McOrist, p. 12 Ernest Wild, a Royal Naval petty officer, was added to the party possibly through the persuasion of his brother, Frank Wild, who was travelling as Shackleton's second-in-command on Endurance.Huntford, p. 414 Some of the appointments to the party were made rather hurriedly, reflecting the limited time frame that Shackleton had allowed for preliminary organisation. Joseph Stenhouse, a young officer from the British India Steam Navigation Company, was appointed as the Aurora's First Officer after travelling from Australia to London to seek an interview with Shackleton.Haddelsey, pp. 21‚Äì22 The Reverend Arnold Spencer-Smith, a Scottish Episcopal Church priest and former schoolmaster, joined as a replacement for one of the original members of the expedition who had left for active service in the First World War.Huntford, pp. 412‚Äì13 Victor Hayward, a London finance clerk with a taste for adventure was recruited on the basis of his having worked on a ranch in Canada.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 31‚Äì32 Although the Ross Sea party's main role was to lay supply depots, Shackleton added a small scientific team to carry out biological, meteorological and magnetic research in the region. The chief scientist in this group was Alexander Stevens, a Scots geologist and former theology student.Tyler-Lewis, p. 41 John Cope, a 21-year-old Cambridge graduate, was the team's biologist; a would-be medical student, he later became ship's surgeon.Tyler-Lewis, p. 50 Two other scientists were appointed in Australia, the physicist Dick Richards (who signed up for a nominal wage of ¬£1 per week) and industrial chemist Keith Jack. An Australian cousin of Spencer-Smith's, Irvine Gaze, was taken on as a general assistant.  Problems in Australia  Mackintosh and the nucleus of the party arrived in Sydney, late in October 1914. They found that Aurora was in no condition for an Antarctic voyage, and required an extensive overhaul. The registration of the ship in Shackleton's name had not been properly completed, and Shackleton had evidently misunderstood the terms under which he had acquired the vessel from Mawson.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 43‚Äì45Haddelsey, p. 25 Mawson had reclaimed much of the equipment and stores that had been aboard, all of which needed replacing. To compound the problem, Shackleton had reduced the funds available to Mackintosh from ¬£2,000 to ¬£1,000, expecting him to bridge the difference by soliciting for supplies as free gifts and by mortgaging the ship.Tyler-Lewis, p. 46 There was no cash available to cover the wages and living expenses for the party.Tyler-Lewis, p. 47 Shackleton was now beyond reach, aboard Endurance en route for Antarctica. Supporters of the expedition in Australia, notably Edgeworth David who had served as chief scientist on the Nimrod expedition, were concerned at the plight in which Mackintosh's party had been placed. They helped to raise sufficient funds to keep the expedition alive, but several members of the party resigned or abandoned the venture.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 46‚Äì49 Some of the last-minute replacements were raw recruits; Adrian Donnelly, a locomotive engineer with no sea experience, signed as second engineer, while wireless operator Lionel Hooke was an 18-year-old electrical apprentice. Despite all these difficulties, Aurora set out from Sydney on 15 December 1914, bound for Hobart, where she arrived on 20 December to take on final stores and fuel. On 24 December, three weeks later than the original target sailing date, the Aurora finally sailed for the Antarctic, arriving off Ross Island on 16 January 1915. Mackintosh decided to establish a shore base at Cape Evans, Captain Scott's headquarters during the 1910‚Äì13 Terra Nova Expedition, and to find a safe winter mooring nearby for Aurora.Bickel, pp. 43‚Äì44 Joyce called this decision of Mackintosh to winter the ship ‚Äì which would have serious ramifications later on ‚Äì as \\"the silliest damn rot that could have possibly occurred\\". It was the first of a number of decisions by Mackintosh that Joyce disagreed with.McOrist, p. 42  First season, 1914‚Äì15  = Depot-laying, January‚ÄìMarch 1915 = Believing that Shackleton might attempt a crossing during the first season, Mackintosh decided that the first two depots had to be laid without delay, one at 79¬∞S near Minna Bluff, a prominent Barrier landmark, and another further south at the 80¬∞ mark. These were, in his view, the minimum that would enable Shackleton's party to survive a crossing of the Barrier.Bickel, pp. 46‚Äì47 The delayed arrival of Aurora in the Antarctic had given little time for acclimatisation for the dogs and for the untrained men, and this led to differences of view about how to proceed. Ernest Joyce, by far the most experienced Antarctic traveller in the party, favoured a cautious approach and wanted to delay the start by at least a week.Fisher, p. 400 Joyce claimed that Shackleton had given him independent control over sledging activities,Bickel, p. 38Tyler-Lewis, pp. 67‚Äì68 a view rejected by Mackintosh and later demonstrated as without foundation.Tyler-Lewis, p. 260 Mackintosh's view having prevailed, on 24 January 1915 the first of three parties set out for the Barrier journey, the others following on the next day. Further dissension soon arose between Joyce and Mackintosh about how far south the dogs should be taken. Joyce wanted them to go no further than the Bluff, but Mackintosh's sense of urgency meant that they were taken on to 80¬∞S.Huntford, p. 412 A further setback was the failure of the attempts to move stores by motor tractor.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 84‚Äì85 Although, ultimately, the depots were laid at Minna Bluff and at 80¬∞S, the overall operation was beset by problems. Not all the stores had reached the depots,For example, of of food and fuel planned for the 80¬∞ depot, only was actually deposited, according to Tyler- Lewis, p. 92 and, as well as the motor tractor failure, all ten dogs taken on the journey perished during the return.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 94‚Äì97 By the time that all parties were reunited at Hut Point (Scott's old Discovery base at the edge of the Barrier) on 25 March,Hut Point, about south of Cape Evans, has been established by Scott during the 1901‚Äì04 Discovery Expedition as a shelter and storage depot. Close to the Barrier's edge, it was a natural starting point for southern journeys. Bickel, p. 46 the men themselves were exhausted and frostbitten, and there was a significant loss of confidence in Mackintosh.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 104‚Äì06 The condition of the sea ice in McMurdo Sound made the journey back to Cape Evans impossible, so the party was stranded until 1 June, in spartan conditions and relying on seals for fresh meat and blubber fuel.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 106‚Äì111 It was later revealed that this first depot-laying season, and its attendant hardships, had been unnecessary. Shackleton had stated, in a letter sent from South Georgia on 5 December 1914 (the date that Endurance left South Georgia for the Weddell Sea) to Ernest Perris of the Daily Chronicle, that he had \\"no chance of crossing that season\\". Mackintosh was to have been informed of this, but \\"the cable was never sent\\".Tyler-Lewis, pp. 214‚Äì15 = Loss of the Aurora = The Aurora, pictured in New Zealand after the drift When Mackintosh departed on 25 January 1915 to lead the depot-laying parties he left the Aurora under the command of First Officer Joseph Stenhouse.Officially, Stenhouse had been in command since leaving Sydney. The mercantile marine officials there would not accept Mackintosh on the grounds of his impaired eyesight, though this change of command was not revealed to the crew and Mackintosh was still treated as the captain ‚Äì Tyler-Lewis, p. 51 The priority task for Stenhouse was to find a winter anchorage in accordance with Shackleton's instructions not to attempt to anchor south of the Glacier Tongue, an icy protrusion midway between Cape Evans and Hut Point.John King Davis later said that, for the ship's safety, this instruction should have been disregarded and the ship wintered in the old Discovery berth at Hut Point ‚Äì Tyler-Lewis, p. 225 This search proved a long and hazardous process. Stenhouse manoeuvred in the Sound for several weeks before eventually deciding to winter close to the Cape Evans shore headquarters. After a final visit to Hut Point on 11 March to pick up four early returners from the depot-laying parties, he brought the ship to Cape Evans and made it fast with anchors and hawsers, thereafter allowing it to become frozen into the shore ice.Bickel, pp. 70‚Äì72 On the night of 7 May a severe gale erupted, tearing the Aurora from its moorings and carrying it out to sea attached to a large ice floe. Attempts to contact the shore party by wireless failed. Held fast, and with its engines out of commission, the Aurora began a long drift northward away from Cape Evans, out of McMurdo Sound, into the Ross Sea and eventually into the Southern Ocean. Ten men were left stranded ashore at Cape Evans. Aurora finally broke free from the ice on 12 February 1916 and managed to reach New Zealand on 2 April.Shackleton (1919), pp. 304‚Äì33 = Improvisation = Because Mackintosh had intended to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed,Tyler-Lewis, pp. 130‚Äì31 the ten stranded men were left with \\"only the clothes on their backs\\". Mackintosh summarised their situation: \\"We have to face the possibility that we may have to stay here, unsupported, for two years. We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather\\".Bickel, pp. 79‚Äì83 Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. \\"Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop\\" fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco‚Äî\\"Hut Point Mixture\\"‚Äîwas concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: \\"Tomorrow we start for Hut Point\\".Bickel, p. 92  Second depot-laying season 1915‚Äì16  = Journey to Mount Hope = The second season's work was planned in three stages. First, all depot stores‚Äî in total‚Äîwere to be transferred from Cape Evans to Hut Point.Tyler-Lewis, p. 148 These stores would then be transported from Hut Point to a base depot at Minna Bluff. Finally, a journey south would be made, to reinforce the 80¬∞ depot and lay new ones at 81¬∞, 82¬∞, 83¬∞, and lastly at Mount Hope, near the foot of the Beardmore Glacier, at 83¬∞30'.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 145‚Äì46 On the left is Mount Hope, the site of the Ross Sea party's final depot Nine men in teams of three would undertake the sledging work. The first stage, hauling over the sea ice to Hut Point, started on 1 September 1915, and was completed without mishap by the end of the month. The second stage, hauling back and forth between Hut Point and the Bluff, proved more problematic, with unfavourable weather, a difficult Barrier surface, and more dissension between Mackintosh and Joyce over methods.Bickel, pp. 94‚Äì111 This time, Mackintosh favoured man-hauling while Joyce wanted to use the four fit dogs‚Äîof the six dogs that had survived the winter, two were pregnant and could not work.Tyler- Lewis, p. 160 Mackintosh allowed Joyce to proceed in his own way, leading a party of six with the dogs, while Mackintosh continued to man-haul with Wild and Spencer-Smith. Joyce's methods proved the more effective in terms of loads carried and the fitness of the men.Tyler-Lewis, p. 159 The base depot at Minna Bluff was completed by 28 December. Shortly after the main march to Mount Hope began, on 1 January 1916, the failure of a Primus stove led to three men (Cope, Jack and Gaze) returning to Cape Evans,Tyler-Lewis, pp. 163‚Äì64 where they joined Stevens. The scientist had remained at the base to take weather measurements and watch for the ship.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 143‚Äì44 The remaining six sledged south, with Spencer-Smith failing rapidly and Mackintosh complaining of a painful knee.Bickel, p. 124 They battled on, laying the depots, using only minimum provisions themselves although, at Joyce's insistence, keeping the dogs well-fed: \\"The dogs are our only hope; our lives depend on them.\\"Bickel, p. 138 As they neared Mount Hope, Spencer-Smith collapsed, unable to proceed.Tyler-Lewis, p. 171 The others left him alone in a small tent and travelled the remaining few miles to lay the final depot at Mount Hope on 26 January 1916. Ernest Wild left a letter for his brother Frank who he assumed was by then travelling across from the Weddell Sea with Shackleton.Huntford, p. 480 = Return = The party turned for home on 27 January, picking up Spencer-Smith on 29th. He was by now physically helpless and had to be loaded on to the sledge.Tyler-Lewis, p. 178 Mackintosh was soon unable to pull, and could only stagger along beside the sledge; by this time the de facto leadership of the group had passed to Joyce and Richards.Bickel, pp. 146‚Äì147 Joyce described the group's plight: \\"I have never known such shocking conditions. This is one of the hardest pulls since we have trekked...all we can do is to slog on with the greatest possible speed.\\" Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith being drawn on the sledge by Joyce and Wild In spite of their difficulties the party made good progress until, on 17 February about short of the Bluff depot, they were halted by a blizzard. They remained tent-bound for five days, by which time their supplies had run out. In desperation the party left the tent the next day, but it soon proved impossible for Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith to travel further. Joyce, Richards and Hayward then sledged through the blizzard to the Bluff, leaving the invalids in a tent under the care of Wild.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 182‚Äì85 Three of the dogs, Con, Towser and Gunner had performed stoutly on the journey but were exhausted. The fourth dog Oscar was inclined to be lazy but \\"in the crisis the massive Oscar just lowered his great head and pulled as he never did when things were going well...he alone gave that extra little strength that enabled us to finally make the depot.\\" This round trip of about took them a week to complete. They returned with food and fuel to sustain their comrades, and the march resumed. Within a short time Mackintosh joined Spencer-Smith on the sledge, and before long, Hayward too collapsed.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 189‚Äì92 The three men still on their feet were by now too weak to haul three invalids, so on 8 March Mackintosh volunteered to stay in the tent while the others attempted to take Spencer-Smith and Hayward to Hut Point. A day later Spencer- Smith died, utterly worn out by exhaustion and scurvy, and was buried in the ice. Joyce and Wild reached Hut Point with Hayward on 11 March and went back for Mackintosh. By 16 March the whole surviving party had reached the hut. From the start of the hauling of loads from Cape Evans on 1 September 1915 to the arrival of the survivors back at Hut Point, a total of 198 days had passed, the longest sledging journey in terms of elapsed time undertaken on any expedition up to that time.Tyler-Lewis p. 249 = Deaths of Mackintosh and Hayward = The five survivors slowly recovered their strength with a diet of seal meat. The ice was too thin for them to risk the final trip to Cape Evans, and the monotony of their diet and surroundings became wearisome. On 8 May Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward intended to risk the ice and walk to Cape Evans. Against the strenuous objections of their companions they departed, and within the hour disappeared into a blizzard. The others went to look for them after the storm and found only tracks leading to the edge of the broken ice. Mackintosh and Hayward were never seen again. They had either fallen through the thin ice or had been carried out to sea on an ice floe. Richards, Joyce and Wild waited until 15 July to make the trip to Cape Evans, where they were at last reunited with Stevens, Cope, Jack and Gaze.Tyler- Lewis, pp. 193‚Äì97Bickel, pp. 204‚Äì13  Rescue  Ernest Shackleton at the time of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition After Aurora's arrival in New Zealand in April 1916, Stenhouse began the task of raising funds for the ship's repair and refit, prior to its return to Antarctica to rescue the marooned men. This proved difficult: nothing had been heard from Shackleton since Endurance had left South Georgia in December 1914, and it seemed likely that relief expeditions were necessary for both strands of the expedition. However, the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition was completely out of funds, and there was no obvious alternative source of finance. Given the chaotic financial circumstances in which Aurora had departed from Australia, private subscribers were hard to find.Haddelsey, pp. 70‚Äì71 Finally, the governments of Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain agreed jointly to fund the refit of Aurora, but insisted on their joint committee having full control of the relief expedition. On 20 May, Shackleton arrived in South Georgia with the story of his escape after the loss of Endurance in the Weddell Sea. His first priority was to effect the rescue of the rest of the Weddell Sea party, stranded on Elephant Island, and it was early December before he arrived in New Zealand. He was too late to influence the organisation of the Ross Sea party's relief; the joint committee had appointed John King Davis to lead the expedition and had dismissed Stenhouse and Aurora's other officers.Haddelsey, pp. 78‚Äì80 Davis was a veteran of Mawson's recent Australasian expedition, and had turned down Shackleton's offers in 1914 of the command of either Endurance or Aurora.Tyler-Lewis, p. 27Haddelsey, p. 22 As a gesture, Shackleton was permitted to sail as a supernumerary officer when the ship left on 20 December. On 10 January 1917, when Aurora reached Cape Evans, the survivors were astonished to see Shackleton approaching them; they then learned for the first time the futility of their labours. After a further week spent in a vain search for the bodies of Mackintosh and Hayward, Aurora headed north for New Zealand, carrying the seven survivors of the original shore party.Shackleton (1919), pp. 334‚Äì337  Aftermath  The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern. The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for ¬£10,000,Huntford, p. 642 and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. After leaving Newcastle, New South Wales on 20 June 1917, Aurora disappeared in the Pacific Ocean. On 2 January 1918 she was listed as missing by Lloyds of London and presumed lost, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain.Tyler-Lewis, p. 274 Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.Tyler-Lewis, p. 267 On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life- saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey. Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers. The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations. He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957.Tyler-Lewis, p. 273 Of the four dogs who survived the trek, Con was killed by the other dogs in a fight before the rescue. The others, Oscar, Gunner and Towser, returned in the ship to New Zealand and were placed in Wellington Zoo, where Oscar lived, allegedly, to the age of 25.Bickel, p. 235 Near the end of his life Dick Richards, the last survivor of the party,Richards died 8 May 1985, aged 91. Tyler-Lewis, p. 265 was without regrets and did not regard the struggle as futile. Rather, he believed, it was something that the human spirit had accomplished, and that no undertaking carried through to conclusion was for nothing.Tyler-Lewis p. 265  See also  * List of Antarctic expeditions * Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration  Notes and references   Sources      External links  * The Ross Sea party story at the State Library of Victoria * The Trans-Antarctic Expedition 1914‚Äì1917 * Nova Online ‚Äì Shackleton's Lost Men Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition ","title":"Ross Sea party"},{"id":"4348177","text":"'t Kuipje () is a multi-use stadium in Westerlo, Belgium.

It was originally a commercial (shareware) program, but with the dominance of Apple's iTunes, development was halted and it was released as freeware. It was retired on 11 November 2004. Design One of the features of Audion that set it apart from its rivals, particularly SoundJam, was its user interface, which featured transparency through a process that mimicked the functionality of alpha channels on Mac OS 9's QuickDraw, a graphics system that did not support them. History Cabel Sasser has written that he and Steven Frank had one goal with Audion: \\"we wanted to listen to our music CDs on our computers while we worked, and we wanted it to be stylish.\\" During Audion's development, MP3 files became a popular means of listening to music on a computer, and Panic licensed an MP3 decoder for incorporation into Audion. Audion was originally conceived as one piece in a set of small applications to be called PanicPack, but time constraints led to the release of Audion 1.0 as standalone application on August 16, 1999. Audion became known for its MP3 decoder, which is reputed to produce sound with superior fidelity. Sasser said this was an accident, and that he and Frank have no idea how they achieved this. Apple tried to meet with Cabel and Steven to hire them to create the original version of iTunes based on their work on Audion.

Machtley served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Rhode Island from 1989 to 1995. From 1996 to 2020, Machtley served as president of Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island. Machtley was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania and attended public schools. He received a B.S. from the United States Naval Academy in 1970, serving in the United States Navy from 1970 to 1975 and the United States Naval Reserve from 1975 to 1995. Machtley received a Juris Doctor from Suffolk University Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1978 and was admitted to the Rhode Island bar in the same year. Machtley ran for Congress as a Republican in the 1st District and defeated 28-year incumbent Democrat Fernand St. Germain in a considerable upset. He was reelected two more times and was very popular even as Rhode Island was trending more and more Democratic. In 1992, for instance, he was reelected with a staggering 70 percent of the vote even as Bill Clinton easily carried the state. He was a moderate Republican in the mold of John Chafee. Machtley gave up his seat to run for Governor of Rhode Island in 1994. He was the heavy favorite in the Republican primary, but was soundly defeated by Lincoln Almond, who went on to victory in November. As of 2020, he is the last Republican elected to the House from Rhode Island and one of only four Republicans to represent Rhode Island in Congress since 1941 (the others being senators John Chafee and Lincoln Chafee and representative Claudine Schneider). Machtley was named president of Bryant in 1996 and shepherded it through its transition to university status in 2004. His salary as of 2017 was reported as $719,243, not including an additional $120,726 reported under other compensation from the organization and related organizations. While at Bryant, he has led several major building campaigns. Popular with faculty and students alike, he can be frequently seen at events on campus. In February 2019 Ron and Katie Machtley made a gift of 1 million dollars to push the Expanding the World of Opportunity campaign over the 100 million dollar mark. Shortly thereafter, the Providence Business News reported that Machtley was paid $6.2M in 2017 as part of a retention package. It is believed this is one of the largest such payouts in the history of American higher education. In May 2019 Machtley announced that he will be retiring as President of Bryant University in May 2020. Machtley, an avid golfer, is a member of Newport Country Club, and is a Rhode Island Commodore.

A weather advisory product based on First Warning, called First Alert, is an automated version of this product, which has come into widespread use by television stations and is marketed under different names depending on the graphics service vendor. Both products are typically used by television stations that have an in-house news and weather operation, although some television stations that do not broadcast news at all or have their newscasts produced by another station in their market may use the system as well. Overview First Warning was created in 1990 by Gary England, then the chief meteorologist of CBS affiliate KWTV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (a city which historically has had the highest number of tornado strikes of any U.S. city since tornado records began to be logged in 1890), and went into use in the spring of 1991. The system was conceived to provide visual alerts for severe and winter weather as well as other hydrologic and non-hydrologic weather advisories to television viewers in a timely and convenient manner. The original version of this forecast product required manual input of weather alerts into the computer system by a meteorologist, with the specific advisory information, the counties/parishes listed in the alert and the advisory type. ABC affiliate KOCO-TV, a market competitor to KWTV, created an automated version of this product called First Alert (a name the station has since used for its doppler radar system, now known as \\"Advantage Doppler HD\\", and which the station currently uses as its weather branding), in which the weather information is updated by the computer itself, delivered by communication routes wired to media outlets from the National Weather Service. Tornado sirens are also usually activated for the affected areas if present. and parses out additional text included in the alert product including the date and time of issuance, SAME county codes and other text coding that precedes and follows the main body of the alert product. First Warning is commonly displayed on-air in the form of a map of an entire state or the specific counties representing a television station's viewing area (which may cover one or more states) with a list of the watches, warnings or advisories either displayed as a legend with colored text, in text beside a colored key or in text inside a colored line bar. Each watch, warning or advisory is assigned a color code and arranged in order of urgency (with tornado warnings being given the highest priority of all alerts). However, while virtually all First Warning systems may display the same color for severe thunderstorm watches (blue), severe thunderstorm warnings (yellow or orange), tornado watches (green) and tornado warnings (red), the color codes for other warnings or advisories may vary depending on the station (in some cases, the color code for one watch/warning/advisory may match that of another). When a watch, warning or advisory (severe or non- severe) is disseminated by either the Storm Prediction Center or a local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office, a scroll with text moving right to left across the screen featuring information on the alert appears, usually accompanied by a three or six brief bursts of a 1050 Hz attention signal that last between three and eight seconds. Although local offices of the National Weather Service have issued warnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms based on the path of a storm since October 2007, most stations using the system display the affected jurisdictions on a per-county basis rather than delineating them by polygons. This system's on-air design element is stylized depending on the television station using it (for example, until an upgrade of its system to allow widescreen overlays during broadcasts of high definition programming in March 2009, Oklahoma City NBC affiliate KFOR- TV's 4WARN Storm Alert variant displayed an \\"L\\"-bar surrounding a resized box display of the current program, containing a map of all 77 Oklahoma counties and accompanying legend, along with the name of a specific county above it ‚Äì the country referenced in the assigned warning/watch color on the map is shown blinking for three seconds ‚Äì and a ticker on the upper third of the screen; a live display of the station's Doppler radar system replaced the alert map when the alert ticker scrolled the second time).KFOR-TV In some areas, the First Warning map is displayed on the top left or right portion of the screen to avoid obstructing the rest of the program or closed captions elsewhere on- screen (though the latter purpose is somewhat defeated by the fact that closed captions occasionally appear at the top of the screen, while in turn, the map may obstruct visual aspects of the program in its positioned area of the screen). The on-screen display is usually removed before the broadcast of a severe weather cut-in or commercial break; the length of time it is displayed may also be truncated if no significant weather is imminent in the viewing area. Additional features were added to First Warning and its variants during the 2000s, including functions allowing the map to toggle between displays of current weather alerts and live or looped radar imagery, including radar images by individual county, which are often accompanied by warning information specific to the jurisdiction. Technical issues As many television stations had not upgraded their master control infrastructures to allow high definition broadcasts of non-network programs or the hardware for the First Warning system to be compatible with HD broadcasts prior to the late 2000s and early 2010s, the high definition program feed would often be downconverted to standard definition when the map/ticker graphic was displayed. Although many stations have upgraded to HD-compatible versions of First Warning, the on-screen graphic map and/or scroll in some cases, may be displayed in animorphic widescreen if the system is not properly set to a 16:9 display, causing partial cropping of the graphic outside of the safe area on 4:3 television sets.

It takes in the lower Central Coast region centred on the Queen Charlotte Strait coast of northern Vancouver Island and the adjoining parts of mainland British Columbia. It has a total land area of 20,288.4 km¬≤ (7,833.4 sq mi) and a 2016 census population of 11,035 persons, most of which is in towns on Vancouver Island and adjoining islands. The administrative centre is in the town of Port McNeill. Other municipalities include the district municipality of Port Hardy, the village of Port Alice, and the village of Alert Bay. Description *Population: 11035 (2016) *Arena - the RDMW's Chilton Regional Arena (built in 1974) is carbon neutral and now relies solely on electricity, from flooding their ice to mowing their grass. Municipalities *Alert Bay *Port Alice *Port Hardy *Port McNeill Geography The region is named for Mount Waddington, which lies on its northeastern boundary and is the highest peak entirely within British Columbia (Fairweather Mountain, on the Alaska boundary, is the highest). Also within the regional district is Mount Silverthrone, the highest volcano in Canada, located in the remote Ha-Iltzuk Icefield. The eastern land boundary of the regional district is largely the divide of the Coast Mountains, inland from which is the Chilcotin District, which is part of the Cariboo Regional District. The northern land boundary with the Central Coast Regional District follows a watershed boundary, separating streams that flow into Queen Charlotte Sound north of Cape Caution from those that flow into the Sound to the south or that flow into Queen Charlotte Strait. The RDMW is relatively underpopulated in comparison to other regional districts, due largely to the fact that most of its land area is rugged mountainscape or remote islands. Within its boundaries are the traditional territories of the Kwakwaka'wakw, who form a significant minority in the region and are the majority in many smaller communities. Band governments and reserve lands are not part of the governance system of the regional district, which is formed of the mayors of the towns and representatives from its electoral areas (though First Nations people living inside municipalities are eligible voters). Sointula, on Malcolm Island, is a historic Finnish Canadian settlement which began life as a cooperative; a similar Danish experiment at Cape Scott was a failure, although the Danish name Holberg remains in the area. Logging and fishing and associated transport and other services, in addition to tourism, are the mainstays of the economic life of the communities of the regional district.

It was passed by the United States House of Representatives on December 16, 2005 by a vote of 239 to 182 (with 92% of Republicans supporting, 82% of Democrats opposing), but did not pass the Senate. It was also known as the \\"Sensenbrenner Bill,\\" for its sponsor in the House of Representatives, Wisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner. The bill was the catalyst for the 2006 U.S. immigration reform protests and was the first piece of legislation passed by a house of Congress in the United States illegal immigration debate. Development and the effect of the bill was featured in The Senate Speaks, Story 11 in How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories a documentary series from filmmaking team Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini. Provisions A march in front of Dallas City Hall protesting HR4437 The bill, passed by the House of Representatives, contains the following provisions among others: * Requires up to 700 miles (1120 km) of double-layered fence along the Mexico‚ÄìUS border at points with the highest number of illegal border crossings. (House Amendment 648, authored by Duncan Hunter (R-CA52) * Requires the federal government to take custody of illegal aliens detained by local authorities. This would end the practice of \\"catch and release\\", where federal officials sometimes instruct local law enforcement to release detained illegal aliens because resources to prosecute them are not available. It also reimburses local agencies in the 29 counties along the border for costs related to detaining illegal aliens. (Section 607) * Mandates employers to verify workers' legal status through electronic means, phased in over several years. Also requires reports to be sent to Congress one and two years after implementation to ensure that it is being used. (Title VII) * Requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to report to Congress on the number of Other Than Mexicans (OTMs) apprehended and deported and the number of those from states that sponsor terrorism. (Section 409) * Formalizes Congressional condemnation of rapes by smugglers along the border and urges Mexico to take immediate action to prevent them. (House Amendment 647, authored by Ginny Brown-Waite) * Requires all illegal aliens, before being deported, to pay a fine of $3,000 if they agree to leave voluntarily but do not adhere to the terms of their agreement. The grace period for voluntary departure is shortened to 60 days. * Requires DHS to conduct a study on the potential for border fencing on the Canada‚ÄìUS border. * Sets the minimum sentence for fraudulent documents at 10 years, fines, or both, with tougher sentencing in cases of aiding drug trafficking and terrorism. * Establishes a Fraudulent Documents Center within DHS. * Increases penalties for aggravated felonies and various frauds, including marriage fraud and document fraud. * Establishes an 18-month deadline for DHS to control the border, with a progress report due one year after enactment of the legislation. * Requires criminal record, terrorist watch list clearance, and fraudulent document checks for any illegal immigrant before being granted legal immigration status. * Reimburses states for aiding in immigration enforcement. * Causes housing of a removed alien to become a felony and sets the minimum prison sentence to three years. * Allows deportation of any illegal alien convicted of driving under the influence (DUI). * Adds human trafficking and human smuggling to the money-laundering statute. * Increases penalties for employing illegal workers to $7,500 for first time offenses, $15,000 for second offenses, and $40,000 for all subsequent offenses. * Prohibits accepting immigrants from any country which delays or refuses to accept its citizens who are deported from the United States (Section 404) =Prohibiting aid to illegal immigrants= It would be a crime to assist an illegal immigrant to \\"remain in the United States... knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such person is an alien who lacks lawful authority to reside in or remain in the United States\\".H.R. 4437, Section 202, amending 274(a)(1)(C), THOMAS (Library of Congress) Furthermore, the prison term applicable to a removed alien, would also be applicable to anyone who knowingly aids or assists\\" that alien \\"to reenter the United States\\".H.R. 4437, Section 205, THOMAS (Library of Congress) Current laws already prohibit \\"aiding and abetting\\" illegal immigrants. This bill, however, is specifically intended to increase enforcement against human smugglers.Washington Post =Amendments= * Eliminates the Diversity Immigrant Visa (also known as Green Card Lottery) program. (House Amendment 650, authored by Bob Goodlatte) * Prohibits grants to federal, state, or local government agencies that enact or maintain a sanctuary city policy.

(House Amendment 641, authored by Rick Renzi) * Institutes a timeline for deployment of US-VISIT to all land- based checkpoints. (House Amendment 642, authored by Michael N. Castle) * Amendment 656 failed. The bill's original (Republican) language changed the existing penalty for first illegal entry from a misdemeanor to a felony. This amendment from Rep. Sensenbrenner would have changed the bill's felony language back to misdemeanor, leaving this aspect of the existing law intact. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 164 to 257. Republicans voted 156 to 65 for the amendment, to change felony back to misdemeanor. Democrats voted 191 to 8 against the amendment, to leave the bill's language as a felony. During the spring of 2006, at the peak of the protest marches, Democrats used this felony aspect to rally protesters against the bill as a whole. This strategy is often referred to as a \\"poison pill\\". Debate The House version of the bill was opposed by a variety of migrant, social justice, humanitarian, and religious organizations, and other groups. Among the criticisms raised by opposition groups are that the proposed legislation might negatively affect over 11 million illegal immigrants and those associated with them, that it includes measures which create substantial barriers to community policing, and that it represents the most draconian anti-illegal immigration bill in nearly a century. The bill does not specify one particular group over any other; passage of the bill would affect all illegal aliens living within the U.S. The fact that most of the protests to date have come largely from Mexican and Hispanic based population centers may stem from the fact that Hispanics are the largest undocumented-immigrant group in the country. On the supportive side of the issue, it is argued that living illegally in the United States is civil infraction, and that this bill merely aims at re-cementing U.S. immigration codes that have long been neglected by changing the seriousness of the infraction from a civil to a criminal one. Supporters of the bill argue that it will increase border security by providing more US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to the border, thereby helping to curtail any possible entry to the country by terrorists, and that the passage of this bill may help curtail drug trafficking and human trafficking from Mexico to the US by depriving smugglers of sources and contacts on the US side of the border. Detractors say the bill includes measures that will infringe on the human rights of asylum seekers by stripping important due process protections, criminalizing status over which they may have no control, and dramatically limiting their access to essential services. Opponents of the bill argue that it would also redefine illegal immigrants as felons, and punish anyone guilty of providing them assistance. In addition, it would create several new mandatory minimum penalties for a variety of offenses, including some that would expose humanitarian workers, public-school teachers, church workers, and others whose only object is to provide relief and aid to five-year mandatory minimum prison sentences. Contrary to some reports, the bill would not have involved massive numbers of deportations. It might have increased the ease of deporting of people caught by local law enforcement, but there are no provisions to actively search for illegal immigrants as happened during Operation Wetback. Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony spoke out on provisions in the immigration bills, he wrote to President Bush that certain proposed measures would effectively outlaw the provision of charitable assistance and religious ministry to individuals not in valid immigration status. On Ash Wednesday, 2006, Cardinal Mahony announced that he would order the clergy and laity of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to ignore H.R. 4437 if it were to become law. He personally lobbied senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein to have the Senate consider a comprehensive immigration reform bill, rather than the enforcement-only bill that passed the House of Representatives. Mahony also blamed the Congress for the illegal immigration crisis due to their failure to act on the issue in the previous 20 years, opposed H.R. 4437 as punitive and open to abusive interpretation, and supported S. 2611. Response Millions of individuals have protested against the legislation because of the perception that it will result in mass deportation. Leaders in the movements involved have called for Congress to pass a bill that allows unauthorized immigrants to receive legal status. The United States Senate is considering bills (e.g. S. 2611) that will strike some of the provisions from H.R. 4437, such as the sections declaring illegal presence to be a felony (illegal entry is currently a misdemeanor) and criminalizing aid to illegal aliens. In addition, many cities and counties have taken formal positions opposing the bill. Labor unions have also largely opposed the bill, though there is division among the labor movement as to whether to support a guest worker program, or legalization of those currently present, two provisions currently in some of the Senate bills. The debate has to an extent polarized opinions among U.S. citizens on illegal immigration. Gallup , CNN , CBS/New York Times , Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg , NBC/Wall Street Journal and several other polls taken have consistently shown public support for the senate immigration bill allowing certain immigrants to earn legal status over the harsher H.R. 4437. However, The Center for Immigration Studies, a pro- immigration reduction organization, conducted a Zogby poll that showed that Americans supported the House approach of enforcement instead of the Senate comprehensive approach. \\"A day without an immigrant\\", where unauthorized immigrants and those who supported them were encouraged to abstain from buying anything and to skip work or school, was organized, taking place on Monday, May 1, 2006. The intention was to show the American public that their economy is helped by undocumented immigrants. It resulted in at least one million marchers nationwide. Major marches were held in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, while smaller events occurred in most states, most prominently in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. Crowds in Los Angeles were estimated at 600,000 for the two boycott marches. At the second largest protest, in Chicago, an estimated 400,000 attended. Not all the organizations in the immigration rights movement supported the boycott and resulted in varied participation rates. The effect the day had on the economy remains largely unknown. On May 11, 2006, Senate leaders declared that they would try to pass an immigration bill of their own by the end of the month, S. 2611. On May 13, 2006, President George W. Bush asked the Pentagon to deploy the United States National Guard to assist border patrol agents. The deployment was to be limited to 6,000 troops. Film The Senate Speaks, Story 11 in How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories a documentary series from filmmakers Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini, that examines the push for comprehensive immigration reform in the United States from 2001-2007. Since its release the film has become an important resource for advocates, policy- makers and educators. The Senate Speaks centers around the response to the Sensenbrenner bill's passage in the House. The film presents the immigrant movement's public response to the toughest anti-amnesty, enforcement-only immigration bill in history. Focus is placed on party leaders' pressure to respond. The film continues to tell the story of the bi-partisan immigration reform that the Senate passed in 2006 as an alternative approach to H.R. 4437.

The brand, named after the Australian slang term sheila for a woman, was launched in October 2005 by Peter Wood, and is part of Esure, the insurance group he founded with HBOS in February 2000. The brand has achieved fame through its advertising featuring three women clad in pink sequinned dresses who sing a variety of jingles promoting Sheilas' Wheels (e.g. \\"For bonzer car insurance deals, girls get onto Sheilas' Wheels\\"), often from the seats of a bubblegum pink convertible ‚Äì sometimes referred to as \\"The Sheilamobile\\". The Sheilas Sheilas' Wheels and the three Sheilas themselves have been the subject of much media attention, and have regularly featured in polls of irritating but effective advertising. In one of the early adverts set in an Australian outback bar, Joe Scully (Shane Connor) of Neighbours can be seen. The Sheilas themselves are all accomplished singers and performers who began performing as The Sheilas during 2006 at gigs in the United Kingdom ‚Äì often at gay clubs and student venues ‚Äì they are Cathi Ogden, Carly Romain and Emma Robbins. Ogden is the only true Australian of the three; Robbins is sister to Ted Robbins, Amy Robbins and Kate Robbins, and was married to Simon Shelton who played Tinky Winky in the Teletubbies, and is a second cousin of Paul McCartney and aunt of The Inbetweeners actress Emily Atack. In the television adverts, the girls usually appear with Romain on the left, Ogden centre and Robbins on the right (with dark hair).Official Sheilas' Wheels website ilovesheilas.com  Sheilas' Wheels Adverts  Since their launch, the Sheilas' Wheels adverts have grown over one hundred video tributes, parodies and imitations on YouTube, including a song by the Amateur Transplants. The Sheilas' Wheels car in the advert is a 'shell' and not a working car. It was created by heavily adapting the body of an old American car. There is a second working car, which is similar to the one in the advert that is used for promotional purposes. It is a 1957 Ford Mercury Monterey convertible that the company bought in 2007 on eBay and restored. The car lives in a warehouse of a specialist company in Surrey, who rent out and sometimes sell American vehicles. The music for the Sheilas' Wheels adverts was composed by John Altman, arranged by Jeff Wayne Music and sung by Cathi Ogden, Carly Romain and Emma Robbins. The Sheilas Single In October 2007, The Sheilas released a single, (I'm So) Happy Happy (You're Mine), produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman with Ogden doing the lead vocal on this recording. Unfortunately, the single only peaked at number 91, despite having an accompanied video for the song. History The brand was originally conceived by copywriter Chris Wilkins and his creative partner and wife, Sian Vickers. The two had previously worked with Peter Wood during the 1990s. Wilkins was the copywriter of the famous advert by Cadbury's, Smash Martians, which is often cited among the most memorable adverts of all time. The Sheilas' Wheels car insurance product introduced a number of female focused benefits that differentiated it from competitors, such as enhanced cover for handbags in cars, female friendly repairers and a free counselling service with its comprehensive cover. In February 2007, Sheilas' Wheels ran a competition for members of the public to appear in their television adverts, Make Me a Sheila Star, which attracted over 11,000 applicants including babies, boys, girls, men and women, with the youngest being 18 months, and the oldest 98. In the end, thirty members of the public appeared in two adverts: one featuring a twelve person pyramid of women on the back of the Sheilamobile, and one featuring them in a stretched version. In January 2008, Sheilas' Wheels began sponsoring the ITV National Weather, with a series of clips showing the Sheilas in a variety of weather conditions. Prior to sponsorship by Sheilas' Wheels, the ITV National Weather had been sponsored by E.ON (formerly Powergen) for eighteen years ‚Äì the longest running sponsorship deal in television history in the United Kingdom (as well as the first). In March 2011, a European Court of Justice ruling stated that price discrimination based on gender breaches EU rules on equality. A spokesman from Sheilas' Wheels parent company Esure stated that \\"premiums will rise drastically for young female drivers.\\" References External links * Financial services companies established in 2005 Advertisements Lloyds Banking Group Vehicle insurance ","title":"Sheilas' Wheels"},{"id":"4348262","text":"Clarence William \\"Tilly\\" Walker (September 4, 1887 ‚Äì September 21, 1959) was an American professional baseball player. After growing up in Limestone, Tennessee, and attending college locally at Washington College, he entered Major League Baseball (MLB). He was a left fielder and center fielder for the Washington Senators, St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Athletics from 1911 to 1923. In 1918, he tied Babe Ruth for the home run crown that season. His power output increased for three seasons beginning in 1920. In 1922, he finished second in the league in home runs and he became one of five players to have reached 100 career home runs. He struggled in his final MLB season and was released by Philadelphia. After his MLB career, Walker played for several seasons in the minor leagues. He also managed a minor league team for one season and worked for the Tennessee Highway Patrol. Early life and career Walker was born in Telford, Tennessee. His family moved to Limestone, Tennessee, when he was a child. His father, W. N. Walker, was an undertaker and a member of the local county high school board of education. Walker later recalled that there was not much to do in Limestone, so he developed his throwing ability by tossing rocks. He pitched and played right field for the baseball team at Washington College in Limestone in the 1908‚Äì09 and 1909‚Äì10 school years. Walker's professional baseball career began with the Spartanburg Spartans of the Carolina Association in 1910 and 1911. Hitting for a .390 batting average with Spartanburg in 35 games in 1911, Walker caught the attention of the Washington Senators. The team purchased Walker's contract from Spartanburg and played him in 95 major league games. Walker finished the season with a .278 average, 2 home runs and 12 stolen bases.Tillie Walker Statistics and History. Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved June 6, 2015. Starting the 1912 season with the Senators, he hit .273 through 35 games, but he committed 8 errors. The Senators started that season poorly, so manager Clark Griffith sold his contract to the minor-league Kansas City Blues in an attempt to overhaul his team. Walker said that he had been present when Griffith handed a telegram to a telegraph operator one night. Owing to telegraphy experience from a boyhood job, Walker heard the Morse Code and realized that the telegram was requesting waivers on him. He was sold to the Blues after no major league teams were interested. He considered returning to Limestone as a telegraph operator, but he ultimately went to the Blues. Walker spent most of 1913 with the Blues, hitting .306 with 6 home runs. He made it back to the major leagues that year with the St. Louis Browns, appearing in 23 games. According to Nellie King, Browns manager Branch Rickey compared Walker to Ty Cobb in terms of ability, saying that they differed only because Cobb displayed more effort. Middle career Walker hit .278 with 6 home runs, 78 runs batted in (RBI) and a career-high 29 stolen bases in 151 games during the 1914 season. His offensive totals dropped with the 1915 Browns; he finished with a .269 average, 5 home runs, 49 RBI and 20 steals. Just before the 1916 season, the Boston Red Sox purchased Walker's contract for US$3,500 ($ today). The purchase of Walker indirectly facilitated the sale of Red Sox star outfielder Tris Speaker to the Cleveland Indians; the Walker deal signaled to Cleveland executives that Boston was looking to trade Speaker, so Cleveland executives began negotiations with the Red Sox that resulted in Speaker's purchase for $55,000. Walker was seen as a good hitter and he had a strong arm, having led the league's outfielders in assists for the two previous seasons. However, he had been criticized for his mood swings and for not being a team player. Walker earned one of his lowest batting averages (.266) that year, but Boston won the 1916 World Series. In that series, he batted twelve times and earned three hits, including a triple. He played only 106 games in 1917, hitting a career-low .246 for the Red Sox. Before the 1918 season, Walker was sent to the Philadelphia Athletics as the player to be named later in a multiplayer trade for first baseman Stuffy McInnis. He tied Ruth as the league leader in homeruns (11) in 1918. In 1919, Walker and two other American League (AL) players each hit 10 home runs, while Ruth hit 29. Later career After the introduction of a new type of ball in 1920, Walker slugged 17 home runs. He registered home run totals of 23 the next year and 37 in 1922. He finished second in the AL in home runs in 1922, ahead of Ruth and trailing Ken Williams by two home runs. Walker passed 100 career home runs that year, becoming one of the first five major league players to reach that milestone. After the 1922 season, Athletics manager Connie Mack opted to prioritize pitching and defense over hitting, so he moved the fences 30 to 40 feet deeper in Philadelphia. Walker struggled under the new conditions and played only 52 games in 1923. Walker was given an unconditional release from the Athletics in December 1923. He returned to the minor leagues for the 1924 season. Walker spent six years with the Minneapolis Millers, Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Maple Leafs and Greenville Spinners. He hit for double-digit home run totals five times as a minor league player, including a 1928 season in which he hit 33 home runs. The 1929 season was his last; he appeared in only 12 games that year. He spent a year as an umpire in the Piedmont League in 1934. In 1940, he was the manager of the Erwin Mountaineers in the Appalachian League. Career statistics In 1421 games over 13 seasons, Walker posted a .281 batting average (1423-for-5067) with 696 runs, 244 doubles, 71 triples, 118 home runs, 679 RBI, 129 stolen bases, 416 bases on balls, .339 on-base percentage and .427 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .949 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. Later life Beginning in 1940, Walker worked as a patrolman for the Tennessee Highway Patrol, stationed in Bristol. He made his home in Limestone. In 1959, he died of natural causes at his brother's home in Unicoi, Tennessee. He is buried at Urbana Cemetery in Limestone.

They have been based in Dublin for many years, but they originally hail from Gweedore, County Donegal. The group consists of brothers Aongus, Seathr√∫n, Ciar√°n, Fionnt√°n, Feargus, and Odhr√°n. Irish is their native tongue and they had to study English as a second language during their school years. The brothers' music has attracted worldwide attention and brought them to audiences from Togo in West Africa to Carnegie Hall in New York City. The Cassidys' father has long been a church choirmaster. He instilled his love of music, and Gaelic music in particular. Music instruction was woven through the boys' childhood. Piano or fiddle was introduced first, followed by other instruments that included whistles and pipes, bodhr√°n, and guitar. All of the Cassidy brothers contribute to the group's harmonies. In addition, each plays several instruments. Odhr√°n studied the violin in Dublin, Vienna, and Manchester. He went on to play classical concertos with a number of orchestras. He is also accomplished on the uilleann pipes. Seathr√∫n, who gave up his desire to work as a professional harpsichordist, plays piano, guitar, a number of different flutes, and bouzouki. Feargus plays bodhr√°n and rhythm guitar, while Aongus plays viola and fiddle. Ciar√°n is the group's accordionist and bassist, and also plays the synthesizer. Fionnt√°n plays mandolin and fiddle. Na Casaidigh's first venture into the world's spotlight came during a mid-'80s visit to Ireland by then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The Irish government requested a performance from the brothers for a state banquet. The event was televised live from Dublin Castle. The brothers repeated the state honor about a decade later during then-U.S. President Bill Clinton's peace-promoting trip to their country. The group has toured throughout the United States, including stops in New York at St. Patrick's Cathedral and Radio City Music Hall. The brothers have received warm welcomes at the Philadelphia Folk Festival and from the Colorado Symphony Orchestra. In West Africa, they appeared at the celebration held to mark the Lome Convention's signing by the European Union. Their lyrics are mostly in Irish.

The village has been famous for the last sixty years for the Naturopathy Center (Nisarg Upchar Ashram) started by Mahatma Gandhi and his disciple Manibhai Desai. The village is also the location of the BAIF Development Research Foundation, an NGO started by Manibhai Desai in the 1960s. BAIF is well known throughout India for its program of breeding high yielding livestock and promoting sustainable rural development. Dr. Manibhai Desai in December 1990 History Uruli was first mentioned in a copper plate issued by Shilahara king Aparajita in 993 AD. The plate refers to Pune region as Punaka vishaya and included Theur, Uruli, Chorachi Alandi, Bhosari etc. Under British colonial rule, Great Indian Peninsula Railway started train services between Mumbai and Solapur in December 1858 with Uruli Kanchan as one of the Stations on the route. The Train Station at that time served as a transit point for pilgrims traveling to Jejuri from Uruli using a dirt road. The train was also used for transporting Pomegranate to the markets of Poona and Bombay. The annual Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi procession has been taking a halt for lunch in Uruli en route to Pandharpur in the Hindu Shaka month of Jeshtha for centuries. The British colonial government set up a relief camp for people affected by the great famine of 1897 in Uruli. The work mainly involved cutting stone from a local quarry. A Grampanchayat or Village Council was established in 1936 with Mr, Pranlal Shah as the first Sarpanch or leader of the council. Mahatma Gandhi came to Uruli Kanchan on 22 March 1946, & stayed here for 7 days with his young disciple, Manibhai Desai. Manibhai, as has been mentioned before, was instrumental in totally transforming the village over many decades.Biography at Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation His first major activity here was to open a Nature cure Ashram which continues to this day and is well known throughout India. This was followed by opening of Schools in Uruli. In 1967, he founded the Bharatiya Agro-Industries Foundation (BAIF).

A few kilometers north of the village flows the Mula-Mutha River. A few kilometers south of the village is the Sinhagad - Bhuleshwar mountain range. A road going South connects Uruli with the pilgrim Center of Jejuri on the other side of the mountain range. The area around Uruli receives on average 600 mm of rain per annum. The medium black soil around Uruli is very fertile and irrigation from the mutha canal allows for growing of cash crops. Demographics According to the census of India of 2011, the population of the village was 30,305 with 15,687 males and 14,618 females. The number of households in the village was 6,693.

Both communities dominate trade in the village. The Sindhi families settled into Uruli when they migrated to India from Sindh after Indian independence in 1947. Due to the excellent transport links to Pune, the village also has a sizeable population that commutes to work in Pune Metropolitan Region. The presence of the school, college and BAIF means there is a high proportion of professionals such as teachers, veterinary doctors, and agricultural scientists residing in the area. With constant expansion of the Pune Metropolitan Area and the consequent demand for more housing, Uruli Kanchan and surrounding villages are slowly turning into outer suburbs of Pune. A number of Gated communities of High end Apartment blocks are getting built.

Over the years he played all positions. Although he pitched a couple of games each season, he was primarily an infielder, and had a career batting average of .260. Early life Morrill's parents were Irish emigrants to Boston, where Morrill was born. He played for amateur teams including the Boston Stars and the Lowell Lowells prior to being signed by the Boston Red Legs in 1876. Career Morrill stood 5'11\\" and weighed 155 pounds as he began his major league career, and he had been known as a second baseman and catcher. Once he arrived in the major leagues, Morrill only played 23 games at catcher, all of them in his first season with Boston. An obituary stated that he was one of the last catchers to appear at the position without a glove. In an incredible season in 1883, he batted .316, played six different positions, and led the Boston Beaneaters to the National League pennant after taking over as manager from Jack Burdock in midseason. Popular baseball manager King Kelly described Morrill as a careful manager who saved Boston a great deal of money through his decisions. Kelly cited Morrill's understanding of the rules when he said that Morrill was a better manager than anyone besides Cap Anson. Kelly dismissed the popular notion that he did not get along with Morrill. Later life Morrill raised five children. After his retirement as a player, Morrill worked for a Boston sporting goods company, where he was manager and treasurer. He died at the age of 77 in Brookline, Massachusetts, and he was interred at the Holyhood Cemetery. The cause of death was pneumonia.
