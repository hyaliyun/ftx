Its adherents have also been referred to as traditionalists and sometimes traditionists (from \\"traditions\\", namely, hadiths).; In jurisprudence Ahl al-Hadith opposed contemporary jurists who based their legal reasoning on informed opinion (ra'y) or living local practice, referred to as Ahl ar-Ra'y. In matters of faith, they were pitted against the Mu'tazilites and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them. The most prominent leader of the movement was Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Subsequently, other Islamic legal schools gradually came to accept the reliance on the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement as valid, while al-Ash'ari (874-936) used rationalistic argumentation favored by Mu'tazilites to defend most of the same tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine. In the following centuries the term ahl al-hadith came to refer to the scholars, mostly of the Hanbali madhhab, who rejected rationalistic theology (kalam) and held on to the earlier Sunni creed. This theological school, which is also known as traditionalist theology, has been championed in recent times by the Salafi movement. The term ahl al-hadith is sometimes used in a more general sense to denote a particularly enthusiastic commitment to hadith and to the views and way of life of the Salaf.  Names and designations  Ahl al-·∏§adith (or A»ô·∏•ƒÅb al- ·∏§adi·πØh () were often approvingly termed Ahl al-Sunnah (), referring to their claim of representing orthodox (that is, entirely tradition-based) Sunni Islam, while they were known pejoratively as al-·∏§ashwiyya (), referring to the overabundance of narratives and traditions in their works. In theological polemics, they were sometimes labeled al-Mujassim≈´n (), referring to how their depictions of the Islamic God were received by their ideological rivals, especially the Mu'tazilites.  Origins and general characteristics  The Ahl al-Hadith movement emerged toward the end of the 8th century CE among scholars of hadith who held the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only acceptable sources of law and creed. At first these scholars formed minorities within existing religious study circles but by the early 9th century had coalesced into a separate movement under the leadership of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. In legal matters, these scholars criticized the use of personal scholarly opinion (ra'y) common among the Hanafi jurists of Iraq as well as the reliance on living local traditions by Malikite jurists of Medina. They also rejected the use of qiyas (analogical deduction) and other methods of jurisprudence not based on literal reading of scripture. In matters of faith, they were pitted against Mu'tazilites and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them. Ahl al-Hadith were also characterized by their avoidance of all state patronage and by their social activism. They attempted to follow the injunction of \\"commanding good and forbidding evil\\" by preaching asceticism and launching vigilante attacks to break wine bottles, musical instruments and chessboards.  Convergence of legal schools  The next two centuries witnessed a broad convergence of legal methodologies which gave rise to the classical theories of Sunni jurisprudence (u·π£≈´l al-fiqh), which, despite long disputes, share formal similarities. Hanafi and Maliki jurists gradually came to accept the primacy of the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement, restricting the use of other forms of legal reasoning to interpretation of these scriptures. This \\"traditionalizing\\" of legal reasoning is exemplified in the work of Malik's student Al-Shafi‚Äòi, which laid the foundation of the Shafi'i legal school. In turn, Hanbali jurists, who led the traditionalist movement and initially opposed the use of qiyas, gradually came to accept it as long as its application was strictly founded on scriptural sources.  Creed  Ahl al-Hadith believed that the zahir (literal, apparent) meaning of the Qur'an and the hadith have sole authority in matters of faith and that the use of rational disputation is forbidden even if it verifies the truth. They did not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, especially those related to the attributes of Allah, accepting them without asking \\"how\\" (bi-la kaifa), and asserted that their realities should be consigned to God alone (tafwid). They believed that every part of the Qur'an is uncreated (ghayr makhluq).Christopher Melchert, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Oneworld Publ., 2006, p 154 Ahl al-Hadith also held that iman (faith) increases and decreases in correlation with the performance of prescribed rituals and duties, such as the five daily prayers.Herbert W. Mason, Humaniora Islamica, Volume 1, p 123. Later traditionalists, such as Ibn Taymiyyah, began to accept and incorporate some of the claims of the rationalists, such as the belief that Allah acts according to His infinite wisdom ·∏•ikmah and that His ordainments and commands generally do not contradict human reason since His wisdom, much like the existence of Allah Himself, is apparent to any thinking man of \\"sound mind\\" and \\"pure, unblemished nature\\" fi·π≠rah and the belief that many of Allah's commands (and especially prohibitions) are inferrable through reason and inherent human nature prior to divine revelation (a view also advocated by the Maturidi school). Nonetheless, they acknowledged that some things may seem unreasonable to certain individuals, but they vehemently maintained that most (if not all) of the Law is rationalizable and that, even if any of Allah's commandments and ordainments seems irrational to humans, any perceived \\"absurdity\\" is the result of human imperfection, be it imperfect capabilities and knowledge or personal desires, and so it is the duty of the faithful to embrace these perceived absurdities regardless. Thus, over time, the views of the traditionalists deviated from those of al-Zahiriyya, such as Ibn Hazm, who asserted that Allah is not bound by anything, whether it be \\"reason\\" or human perspectives, and deviated even further from the 'Ash'arites, of which most maintained that \\"morality\\" without divine revelation is but social customs. = Theological controversies = In 833 the caliph al-Ma'mun tried to impose Mu'tazilite theology on all religious scholars and instituted an inquisition (mihna) which required them to accept the Mu'tazilite doctrine that the Qur'an was a created object, which implicitly made it subject to interpretation by caliphs and scholars.; Ibn Hanbal led traditionalist resistance to this policy, affirming under torture that the Quran was uncreated and hence coeternal with God.; Although Mu'tazilism remained state doctrine until 851, the efforts to impose it only served to politicize and harden the theological controversy. This controversy persisted until Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (874-936) found a middle ground between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, using the rationalistic methods championed by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine. A rival compromise between rationalism and traditionalism emerged from the work of al-Maturidi (d. c. 944), and one of these two schools of theology was accepted by members of all Sunni madhhabs, with the exception of most Hanbalite and some Shafi'i scholars, who persisted in their rejection of kalam, although they often resorted to rationalistic arguments themselves, even while claiming to rely on the literal text of scripture. Although the scholars who rejected the Ash'ari and Maturidi synthesis were in the minority, their emotive, narrative-based approach to faith remained influential among the urban masses in some areas, particularly in Abbasid Baghdad.; While Ash'arism and Maturidism are generally called the Sunni \\"orthodoxy\\", the traditionalist school has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni creed.: \\"The Ash‚Äòari school of theology is often called the Sunni ‚Äòorthodoxy.‚Äô But the original ahl al-hadith, early Sunni creed from which Ash‚Äòarism evolved has continued to thrive alongside it as a rival Sunni ‚Äòorthodoxy‚Äô as well.\\" In the modern era it has had a disproportionate impact on Islamic theology, having been appropriated by Wahhabi and other Salafi currents and spread beyond the confines of the Hanbali school of law.

History  It was founded in 1391 by Wenceslas Kriz (known as 'the Merchant'), and John of Milheim, and taught solely in the Czech vernacular, thus breaking with German domination of the Medieval Bohemian church.Spinka, Matthew. John Hus: A Biography. 1968, Princeton UP. p. 47 The building was never officially called a church, only a chapel, though it could contain 3,000 people; indeed, the chapel encroached upon the parish of Sts. Philip and James, and John of Milheim paid the pastor of that church 90 grossi as compensation.Spinka, p. 47. Hus became a rector and a preacher in March 1402. After Hus's excommunication in 1412, the Pope ordered the Bethlehem chapel to be pulled down, although this action was rejected by the Czech majority on the Old Town council.Spinka, pp 162-163 After Hus's death, he was succeeded by Jacob of Mies. In the 17th century, the building was acquired by the Jesuits. It fell into disrepair and in 1786 it was demolished; in 1836‚Äì1837 an apartment building was built in its place. Under the Czechoslovakian communist regime the building was restored by the government to its state at the time of Hus. Most of the chapel's exterior walls and a small portion of the pulpit date back to the medieval chapel. The wall paintings are largely from Hus's time there, and the text below is taken from his work De sex erroribus, and contrast the poverty of Christ with the riches of the Catholic Church of Hus's time.Spinka, pp. 48-49 Asteroid 90892 Betl√©msk√° kaple, discovered by Czech astronomer Milo≈° Tich√Ω at the Kle≈• Observatory in 1997, was named after the chapel.

Originally designed for arcades, it was later ported to the SG-1000, Mark III/Master System and Game Gear video game consoles by Sega, and to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers by Activision. The game is also known as for its Sega Mark III release in Japan and Revenge of Drancon for its Game Gear release in North America. A high definition remake of the game, titled Wonder Boy Returns, was developed by CFK and released on Steam on October 12, 2016. It was the first in the long-running Wonder Boy series of games and was followed up by five sequels, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair, Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap, Wonder Boy in Monster World and Monster World IV. The game was also adapted by Hudson Soft as Adventure Island, which spawned its own series of games. Gameplay The titular Wonder Boy is a tribal caveman- like boy whose girlfriend Tina has been captured by the dark King (known as Drancon in the Game Gear version). The player must guide the Wonder Boy through seven \\"areas\\", each consisting of four \\"rounds\\". The boy can arm himself with a stone hatchet, which he can throw at oncoming foes, a skateboard with which he can rush through the levels and temporary protection by an angel which allows him to destroy foes by simply running into them. All of the aforementioned power-ups are obtained by breaking open eggs. These eggs can also contain unpleasant surprises ‚Äì curses which cause him to lose vitality more quickly than usual, and poisonous mushrooms which reduce the boy's vitality in one go. The player must remain aware of the vitality meter, which constantly runs down at a steady pace and can only be refilled by collecting fruit throughout the level. There is also one doll to collect in each level, which doubles the bonus points awarded at the end of the level. If all 28 dolls are collected, then an bonus eighth area will be unlocked. At the end of every \\"area\\", the boy will encounter an incarnation of the chief antagonist as a boss character. Once defeated, the mighty lord's mask flies off and transforms into an item such as a tea cup or a piece of fruit, before subsequently making his escape. A two-player alternating mode is available where each player takes turn whenever the other one loses a life.  Plot  The tropical wonder boy himself Tom Tom must save his girlfriend Tina from demons and monsters.  Ports  =SG-1000= The first home version of Wonder Boy was released exclusively in Japan for the SG-1000 (Sega's first video game console) during the same year the arcade version was released. The game was released in a \\"My Card\\" format, which required the \\"Card Catcher\\" peripheral. Because of the severe hardware differences, the game was remade completely for the SG-1000 with an all new set of stages. Certain enemies, stages, and items were also omitted, such as the skateboard. = Master System and Game Gear= The version of Wonder Boy for the Master System and Game Gear was a direct port of the arcade title, with some minor reductions to accommodate the more limited hardware. In Japan, the Sega Mark III version was entitled Super Wonder Boy to differentiate it from the previous port, although the overseas releases dropped the word \\"Super\\" from the title. The Game Gear port in the United States was entitled Revenge of Drancon. The graphics were lifted straight from the arcade version, but the HUD was restricted to a simple vitality bar ‚Äì the score and number of lives were displayed prior to starting the level. The sound was modified slightly to adapt it to the more limited audio hardware. The graphics were brighter. The controls were modified slightly to make it possible to only perform a high jump when the run button was pressed, whereas it was possible in the arcade version to perform one simply by being in motion when the jump button was pressed. However, the most important aspect that differentiated it from its arcade counterpart was the addition of \\"areas\\". Wonder Boy for the Master System and Game Gear had nine areas; this included all seven areas from the arcade original + two new areas created specifically for this version. The new areas featured unique level designs different than the rest of the game. These two areas were dubbed as the fourth area and eighth area in the game. This resulted in a modification on the numbering for the areas lifted from the arcade original (for example, what was the fourth area on the arcade version became the fifth area on the SMS/GG version). As with the arcade version, collecting all dolls in the game would reveal an extra \\"area\\" which, in this case, would be the tenth area. = ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC = The license to produce the home computer versions of Wonder Boy was awarded to Activision, who produced versions of the game for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC in 1987. The game was true in spirit to the original, although the levels beyond level 4 differed to allow for the necessary multi-load system. The first round of each area was always a forest, the second an ocean, the third a cave and the fourth a forest at nighttime (the C64 had round 1 at night time and round 4 during the day). This was not the case in the console and arcade versions, in which the areas provided more variation (although based on these same four themes). The Amstrad CPC version contained the graphics used in the C64 conversion, but the sound from the Spectrum conversion. Some Spectrum versions were afflicted with a bug that prevented the game from preloading all four levels in 128K mode ‚Äì the fourth level's graphics would not load correctly, and it would be impossible for the player to move before the game crashed and the computer rebooted within around three seconds. As a result, 128K owners were forced to boot into 48K mode to run the game, and did not enjoy the benefit of having all levels preloaded as was designed. Under 48K mode, however, the 128K music still worked. = Mobile phone port = In 2004, Sega released a pixel-perfect conversion of the game designed for mobile phones. = Wii Virtual Console = On March 31, 2008, Wonder Boy was made available for play on the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console in North America. Japan and Europe got the game a week later. The game is available for 500 Wii points, and is an emulation of the Sega Master System version. = Remake= A high- definition remake of the game, titled Wonder Boy Returns, was developed by CFK and released on Steam on October 12, 2016, later releasing on PlayStation 4 on March 30, 2017. A limited run physical edition of the PS4 version was released by Strictly Limited Games on January 27, 2019.https://limitedgamenews.com/2019/01/22/wonder-boy-returns-playstation-4/ An enhanced version, Wonder Boy Returns Remix, was released on Nintendo Switch on May 23, 2019.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-05-02/cfk-releases- wonder-boy-returns-remix-game-on-switch-on-may-23/.146333  Clones  Escape had a licensing arrangement whereby it owned the rights to the game design, but Sega retained the Wonder Boy trademark. Because of this, Escape teamed up with Hudson Soft to produce a conversion of the game for the NES, under a new license. To get around the licensing issue, Hudson Soft had the title changed which resulted into Adventure Island. Although Hudson could have featured the generic boy from Wonder Boy as the main character of Adventure Island, it inserted instead a caricature of Takahashi Meijin (known as Master Higgins in English games). Since Adventure Island is based on the arcade version of Wonder Boy, it does not contain any of the original levels found in the Master System or Game Gear ports. The bonus stage that was reserved for collecting all the dolls in Wonder Boy is integrated in this game as a regular area.http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/wonder-boy/ In this arrangement, once again, Hudson Soft retained the rights to the character and name, allowing the company to continue to produce future games using the Adventure Island name and characters. These sequels are not based on the Wonder Boy sequels. Hudson released Champion Takahashi's Adventure Island for the MSX. This version featured Master Higgins as the main character but retained the music of Wonder Boy, unlike the NES Adventure Island which had a completely different soundtrack. Escape repeated the same kind of task by converting Sega's 1991 beat 'em up arcade Riot City, into Hudson Soft's 1992 TurboGrafx-CD title Riot Zone. Through its 2012 absorption of Hudson Soft, Konami currently owns the rights to the Adventure Island series.  Arcade hardware  The game ran on Sega's proprietary System 1 hardware, based on a Z80 processor running at 4 MHz. Audio was provided by two 2 MHz SN76496 chips with a 4 MHz Z80 co- processor. The graphics were provided by a raster video unit at a resolution of 256 x 224. The game required a cabinet that provided a two-axis joystick and three input buttons ‚Äì one to act as a start button, two as gameplay buttons. Critical reaction =Arcade version= Upon release, the arcade game was critically acclaimed. In Japan, Game Machine listed Wonder Boy on their May 15, 1986 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. In the July 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, the game was lauded by reviewer Clare Edgeley for the detailed, bright, colorful graphics and simple addictive gameplay, whilst some criticism was leveled towards the lack of variety. She also stated it reminds her of Super Mario Bros. though \\"not as complicated but just as playable.\\" Contemporary writers now note that both games share a common ancestor in Pac-Land.at IGN Wonder Boy was a commercial success in arcades. It appeared at number-two on Euromax's nationwide UK arcade chart in 1987, just below Capcom's 1942 at number- one.Arcade Action, Computer and Video Games, December 1987 =Amstrad CPC version= Amstrad Action awarded the Amstrad CPC version of the game 68% on its original release in 1987, and 62% on its re-release three years later.

A survey of the land in this Zone shows that 24% is arable or cultivable, 4.6% pasture, 0.37% forest, 17.4% shrubland, 47.3% degraded or unusable, and the remaining 6.3% all other uses.Seid Yassin, \\"Small-Scale Irrigation\\", p. 34 To combat increasing droughts and improve crop yields, 12 irrigation projects have been undertaken in five woredas, affecting 1.64 square kilometers and benefiting 6,783 households.Seid Yassin, \\"Small-Scale Irrigation\\", p. 42 Demographics Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this Zone has a total population of 1,500,303, an increase of 19.04% over the 1994 census, of whom 752,895 are men and 747,408 women; with an area of 12,172.50 square kilometers, North Wollo has a population density of 123.25. While 155,273 or 10.35% are urban inhabitants, a further 2 persons are pastoralists. A total of 355,974 households were counted in this Zone, which results in an average of 4.21 persons to a household, and 343,504 housing units. The largest ethnic group reported in North Wollo was the Amhara (99.38%); all other ethnic groups made up 0.62% of the population. Amharic is spoken as a first language by 99.28%; the remaining 0.72% spoke all other primary languages reported. 82.74% practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 17.08% of the population said they were Muslim.Census 2007 Tables: Amhara Region, Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4. The 1994 national census reported a total population for this Zone of 1,260,317 in 309,231 households, of whom 633,702 were men and 626,615 women; 89,055 or 7.07% of its population were urban dwellers at the time. The largest ethnic group reported in North Wollo was the Amhara (99.61%); all other ethnic groups made up 0.39% of the population. Amharic was spoken as a first language by 99.62%; the remaining 0.38% spoke all other primary languages reported. 83.36% practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 10% of the population said they were Muslim.1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Amhara Region, Vol. 1, part 1, Tables 2.1, 2.11, 2.14, 2.17 (accessed 6 April 2009). According to a May 24, 2004 World Bank memorandum, 6% of the inhabitants of North Wollo have access to electricity, this zone has a road density of 69.7 kilometers per 1000 square kilometers (compared to the national average of 30 kilometers),\\"Ethiopia - Second Road Sector Development Program Project\\", p. 3 (World Bank Project Appraisal Document, published 19 May 2003) the average rural household has 0.7 hectare of land (compared to the national average of 1.01 hectare of land and a regional average of 0.75 for the Amhara Region)Comparative national and regional figures comes from another World Bank publication, Klaus Deininger et al. \\"Tenure Security and Land Related Investment\\", WP-2991 (accessed 23 March 2006). and the equivalent of 0.7 heads of livestock. 13.2% of the population is in non-farm related jobs, compared to the national average of 25% and a Regional average of 21%. 27% of the zone is exposed to malaria, and none to tsetse fly.

Vedic texts have a wide geographical horizon, speaking of oceans, rivers, mountains and deserts. ‚ÄúEight summits of the Earth, three shore or desert regions, seven rivers.‚Äù (asthau vyakhyat kakubhah prthivyam tri dhanva yojana sapta sindhun RV.I.35.8). The Vedic land is a land of the seven rivers flowing into the ocean. It encompasses the regions from Gandhara to Kurukshetra. Mythology A recurring theme in the Yajurveda is that of Indra slaying Vritra (literally \\"the obstacle\\"), liberating the rivers; in a variant of the myth, Indra smashes the Vala cave, releasing the cows that were within. Though the two myths are separate,H.-P. Schmidt, Brhaspathi and Indra, Wiesbaden 1968 rivers and cows are often poetically correlated in the Rigveda, for example in 3.33, a notable hymn describes the crossing of two swollen rivers by the chariots and wagons of the Bharata tribe: :3.33.1cd Like two bright mother cows who lick their youngling, Vipas and Sutudri speed down their waters. (trans. Griffith) Seven Rivers The Seven Rivers are a group of seven chief rivers of uncertain or fluctuating identification (the number seven is of greater importance than the exact members of the group)- compare the Saptarishi of the Avesta (and also the later seven seas and the seven climes) . The Avesta's ' are preemptively equated with the Vedic Sapta Sindhava·∏• or vis-a-vis: in Vendidad 1.18 these are described to be the fifteenth of the sixteen lands created by Mazda.Gnoli 1989 pp.44‚Äì46 Note: The term Sapta Sindhava, commonly used in Hindi and other Indian languages, is the nominative plural in Sanskrit (dropping the final visarga in conformity with the convention when expressing Sanskrit words in modern languages). Sapta Sindhu, often seen in English, is in the singular, and is therefore ungrammatical. =Identity of the Seven Rivers= It is not entirely clear how the Seven Rivers were intended to be enumerated. They are often located in northern India / eastern Pakistan. If the Sarasvati and the five major rivers of India are included (Shutudri/Sutlej, Parushni/Ravi, Asikni/Chenab, Vitasta/Jhelum, Vipasha/Beas, the latter all tributaries of Sindhu/Indus), one river is missing, probably the Kubha. Other possibilities include the Arjikiya or Sushoma; compare also the list of ten rivers, both east and west of the Indus, in the Nadistuti sukta, RV 10.75. In 6.61.10, Sarasvati is called \\"she with seven sisters\\" (saptasvasƒÅ) indicating a group of eight rivers, the number seven being more important than the individual members (see also saptarshi, hapta kar≈°uuar /haft keshvar in Avestan), so that the list of the Sapta Sindhava may not have been fixed or immutable. In RV 10.64.8 and RV 10.75.1, three groups of seven rivers are referred to (' \\"thrice seven wandering rivers\\"), as well as 99 rivers. The Sapta-Sindhava region was bounded by Saraswati in the east, by the Sindhu in the west and the five in between were Satudru, Vipasa, Asikni, Parusni and Vitasta. Not all researchers agree with this interpretation. According to other interpretation, \\"Sapta Sindhu\\" is only a small subset of the Rig Vedic terrain and its disproportionate importance derives from it being the original homeland of the victorious Bharata Trutsu tribe. Geography of the Rigveda Geography of the Rigveda Identification of Rigvedic rivers is the single most important way of establishing the geography of the early Vedic civilization. Rivers with certain identifications stretch from eastern Afghanistan to the western Gangetic plain, clustering in the undivided Punjab (the region's name means \\"five rivers\\"). A number of names can be shown to have been re-applied to other rivers as the center of Vedic culture moved eastward from the central Vedic heartland in undivided Punjab. It is possible to establish a clear picture for the latest phase of the Rigveda, thanks to the Nadistuti sukta (10.75), which contains a geographically ordered list of rivers. The most prominent river of the Rigveda is the 4925 kilometers (3061 miles) long Sarasvati, next to the 3249 kilometers (2019 miles) long Indus. The Rig Veda mentions Saraswati river as between Yamuna to the East and river Sutlej to the west. The Mahabharata clearly talks about this massive Sarasvati drying up. The mighty and perennial Sarasvati flowed from the Himalayan Glaciers to the Rann of Kutch where it emptied into the Arabian sea. Dwaraka of Lord Krishna was part of this civilization. 2704 kilometers (1690 miles) long Ganges River was also flowing at that time into the Bay of Bengal. Saraswati started drying up in 4000 BC due to tectonic plate shifts which blocked the glacier source and changed the course of the Yamuna & Sutlej Rivers. This made River Saraswati dependent on rains, not glacial ice. Gradually the whole river was buried under the Thar desert sand dunes, leaving only disconnected pools and lakes here and there. The Yamuna river soon started pouring into The Ganges River instead of Saraswati and The Sutlej River started pouring into The Indus River. When the Saraswati river started drying up, the whole civilization may have migrated to fertile lands ‚Äì some to Ganges, some to south west of India from Goa to Kerala. List In the geographical organization of the following list, it has to be kept in mind that some names appearing both in early and in late hymns may have been re-applied to new rivers during the composition of the Rigveda.

Measuring in length, it is a stocky short-tailed green parrot with a yellow head. It prefers to live in mangrove forests or forests near rivers or other bodies of water. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the yellow-crowned amazon (Amazona ochrocephala). It is a popular pet and an excellent talker. Poaching for the international pet trade has driven the species to near-extinction in the wild; around half of all wild-caught birds are thought to die in the process. The yellow-headed amazon is CITES I listed, and there are legal restrictions on its trade and ownership, including a certification system. Taxonomy Tres Mar√≠as amazon at Cougar Mountain Zoological Park, United States This species is part of the Amazona ochrocephala complex, which also includes the yellow-naped amazon (A. auropalliata). This complex, which has been called \\"a taxonomic headache\\", is considered a single species by some authorities and split into three species by others. The split is mainly based on the amount of yellow in the plumage, the color of the legs and bill, the proximity of A. oratrix and A. auropalliata in Oaxaca, Mexico, without apparent interbreeding,Binford, L. 1989. A distributional survey of the birds of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Orn. Monographs. 43: 1-418. and the presence of both A. ochrocephala and A. auropalliata in northern Honduras.Monroe, B., JR., & T. Howell. 1966. Geographic variation in Middle American parrots of the Amazona ochrocephala complex. Occasional Papers of the Museum of Zoology, no. 34. Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. This evaluation has, however, been confused by misunderstandings regarding the plumage variations in the populations in northern Honduras, where birds vary greatly in amount of yellow on the head, crown and nape, but have pale bills and a juvenile plumage matching A. oratrix, but neither A. ochrocephala nor A. auropalliata.Lousada, S., & S. Howell. 1996. Distribution, variation, and conservation of Yellow-headed Parrots in northern Central America. Cotinga 5: 46-53. In 1997, the population from the Sula Valley in northern Honduras was described as a new subspecies, hondurensis, of A. oratrix.Lousada, S., & S. Howell. 1997. Amazona oratrix hondurensis: A new subspecies of parrot from the Sula Valley of northern Honduras. Bull. BOC 117: 203-223. A. auropalliata caribaea on the Islas de la Bah√≠a, which is relatively close to the recently described A. oratrix hondurensis, may have a relatively pale lower mandible, indicating that gene flow may occur between the two.Lousada, S. 1989. Amazona auropalliata caribaea: A new subspecies of parrot from the Bay Islands, northern Honduras. Bull. BOC 109: 232-235. If confirmed, this could suggest that the two are better considered conspecific. Alternatively, it has been suggested that caribaea and parvipes, both typically considered subspecies of A. auropalliata, may be closer to A. oratrix than they are to the nominate A. auropalliata. Both are relatively small and have red on the shoulder like A. oratrix, but unlike nominate A. auropalliata. The members of this complex are known to hybridize in captivity, and recent phylogenetic analysis of DNA did not support the split into the three \\"traditional\\" biological species, but did reveal three clades, which potentially could be split into three phylogenetic species: a Mexican and Central American species (including panamensis, which extends slightly into South America), a species of northern South America, and a species from the southern Amazon Basin. The Central American clade can potentially be split further, with panamensis (the Panama amazon) and tresmariae (the Tres Mar√≠as amazon) recognized as two monotypic species.Eberhard, J., & E.

Ibis 149: 564-574 According to the traditional split, A. oratrix includes the taxa tresmariae (from the Tres Mar√≠as Islands), belizensis (from Belize) and hondurensis (from the Sula Valley in northern Honduras) as subspecies. An additional subspecies, magna, has sometimes been recognized for the population on the Gulf slope of Mexico, but today most authorities consider it invalid, instead including this population in oratrix, which also occurs on the Pacific slope of Mexico.Clements, J. 2007. The Clements Checklist of the Birds of the World. Christopher Helm. In contrast, the population in northwestern Honduras and adjacent eastern Guatemala (near Puerto Barrios), which resembles A. oratrix belizensis and commonly is included in that subspecies, may represent an undescribed subspecies. It has sometimes been referred to as guatemalensis,Juniper, T., & M. Parr. 1998. A Guide to the Parrots of the World. Pica Press, East Sussex. but until this population is officially described, the name remains provisional. The origin of the common epithet \\"double yellow-headed\\" is that this species is differentiated from the others in the yellow-headed amazon complex by possessing both the yellow nape and yellow crown of its two close relatives, hence a \\"double-yellow\\" head. Description The yellow-headed amazon averages long. The shape is typical of amazons, with a robust build, rounded wings, and a square tail. The body is bright green, with yellow on the head, dark scallops on the neck, red at the bend of the wing, and yellow thighs. The flight feathers are blackish to bluish violet with a red patch on the outer secondaries. The base of the tail also has a red patch, which is usually hidden. The outer tail feathers have yellowish tips. 8 weeks old. The bill is horn-colored (gray), darker in immatures of the Belizean subspecies. The eye ring is whitish in Mexican birds and grayish in others. The most conspicuous geographical difference is the amount of yellow. In adults, the head and upper chest are yellow in the subspecies of the Tres Mar√≠as Islands (tresmariae); just the head in the widespread subspecies of Mexico (oratrix); just the crown in Belize (belizensis); and the crown and nape in the Sula Valley of Honduras (hondurensis, which thus resembles the yellow-naped parrot). Immatures have less yellow than adults; they attain adult plumage in 2 to 4 years. The variety \\"Magna\\" (or \\"Magnum\\") is bred for more yellow and commands a premium price as a pet.

Some \\"extreme\\" Magnas have as much yellow as Tres Mar√≠as birds, but are distinguished from them by heavier barring on the chest and a less bluish tint to the green plumage. A commercial site. Shows many photographs comparing \\"extreme Magna\\" to tresmariae Wild birds give low-pitched, sometimes human-sounding screams, but often fly silently (unlike many other parrots). The calls can be described as \\"a rolled kyaa-aa-aaah and krra-aah-aa-ow, a deep, rolled ahrrrr or ahrhrrrr,\\" etc. Young birds make a \\"clucking\\" sound to indicate that they are hungry. Distribution and habitat In Belize This species lives in riparian forest and areas with scattered trees, as well as evergreen forest in Belize and mangroves in Guatemala. A notable ecoregion of occurrence is the Belizean pine forests.C. Michael Hogan & World Wildlife Fund. 2012. Belizean pine forests. ed. M. McGinley. Encyclopedia of Earth. Washington DC It occurs singly or in pairs, in small groups, and occasionally in big flocks. The range formerly included both coastal slopes of Mexico from the Tres Mar√≠as Islands and Jalisco to Oaxaca and from Nuevo Le√≥n to northern Chiapas and southwestern Tabasco, as well as a disjunct area including most of Belize, and another comprising a small part of northeastern Guatemala and northwestern Honduras. However, their numbers have been reduced drastically‚Äîby 90%, to 7,000, from the mid-1970s to 1994, and by 68% from 1994 to 2004‚Äîbecause of capture for the pet trade and habitat destruction. Introduced populations can be found in Stuttgart, Germany where a population of over 50 individuals resides. Smaller introduced populations are to found at Imperial Beach, Santa Ana, Loma Linda and Pasadena; all in Southern California. In addition, introduced ‚Äìand apparently breeding‚Äì populations have been reported in Puerto Rico . Conservation status Upper body The yellow-headed amazon is considered endangered by the IUCN, and is on the CITES Appendix I, which by international treaty, has made export, import and trade of wild-caught yellow- headed amazons illegal and the trade in birds bred in aviculture subject to controls in most of the world. Captive-bred yellow-headed amazons can be sold and owned legally subject to checks and regulations. Populations range from Central America, through Mexico, and even into the southmost region of Texas. Generally, throughout the world, sale of Appendix I species bred in aviculture must be accompanied with official certification which is provided by the breeder, and they must have a closed ring on one leg. The popularity of yellow-headed amazons as a pet continues to fuel poaching efforts, which have nearly driven it to extinction in the wild. Their wild population has declined from 70,000 to 7,000 in the past two decades alone. An estimated 40-60% of poached yellow-headed amazons die before they are sold. The situation for tresmariae, which potentially can be treated as a separate species, is unclear, but its very small range gives cause for concern and some reports indicate it is under considerable threat. As pets Pet parrot Though only captive-bred yellow-headed amazons may be owned, these are widely available (if somewhat expensive) and their personalities make them highly desirable pets; they have been kept as such for centuries because they are among the parrots that \\"talk\\" best. Their vocal abilities are generally bested only by the African grey parrot and matched by similar species, such as the yellow- naped parrot. Yellow-headed amazons in captivity appear to have an affinity for both singing and the learning of song - and a naturally powerful, operatic voice. As in most amazons, nervous plucking of plumage is rare among this species. A generally recognized disadvantage of the yellow-headed amazon and its close relatives (such as the yellow-naped amazon) is hormonal aggressiveness, most notable among males in the breeding season. It is a member of the \\"Hot Three\\" (referring to the male bird's \\"hot\\" temper), along with the yellow-naped and blue-fronted.

She was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Wicklow constituency from 1995 to 2007. Private life She was educated at St. Kilian's Community School in Bray and is a graduate of University College Dublin holding a BA degree. Before becoming a TD, she worked as a hotel manager. She is married with four children. Political career During the 1997‚Äì2002 D√°il she gained some notability as she, and other independent TDs, supported the government which otherwise would not have had an overall majority. Before and after this period she was little known outside Wicklow. She was also a member of Wicklow County Council from 1995 to 2003, when she vacated her seat in favour of her brother, Christopher, when the dual mandate ended. She was first elected to the 27th D√°il at the Wicklow by-election in June 1995 following the death of her father, sitting independent TD Johnny Fox. She was re-elected at the 1997 general election and again at the 2002 general election. On both occasions, she was the last candidate to reach the quota. In 2002 she was elected by an extremely narrow margin of 19 votes over the Labour Party candidate Nicky Kelly. She retired at the 2007 general election. Fox wished to spend more time with her family. Since retiring from politics, Fox started an artisan food business making Ice Cream, and has volunteered at a local charity shop. She sings with the country band The Whipperwills.

He earned his undergraduate degree in English at the University of Chicago in 1934, his Master's degree at Harvard in History and Government in 1938, and his doctoral degree in political science at the University of Chicago in 1943. He married Helen A. Walcher on December 21, 1940 and they raised two children. Academic career and public service From 1944-1947 he was director of research and publications for The Council of State Governments in Chicago. In 1947 he was appointed professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. In 1952 and 1953 he was part of U.N. sponsored missions in public administration in Colombia, the Philippines, and Japan. His next one-year U.N. appointment was as co-Director of the Public Administration Institute for Turkey and the Middle East in Ankara, Turkey. Indiana University then appointed him director of the Institute of Training for Public Service and Coordinator of Indonesian and Thailand Public Administration Programs. By the time of his retirement, further appointments, research and lecture tours and vacations had enabled him to visit nearly one hundred countries around the world as well as every state in the union. In 1956, after a year as visiting professor of government at the University of California, Berkeley, he returned to Bloomington as Professor of Government at Indiana University, where he remained until his retirement.\\"Lynton Caldwell leaves quite a legacy,\\" Bloomington Herald-Times, August 22, 2006.

During his career, Caldwell served on the faculties of the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Oklahoma, Syracuse University, and the University of California at Berkeley, and had shorter appointments at some 80 other collegiate institutions both within the U.S. and overseas. At various times, Caldwell served as advisor or consultant to the U.S. Senate, UNESCO, the United Nations, the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Defense, and Interior, and the National Institutes of Health. Although not a natural scientist, as part of his work towards establishing interdisciplinary study in universities and achieving a greater merging of the two worlds of science and public policy, he became deeply involved in national and international environmental affairs and worked closely with several important scientific bodies serving, among many appointments, on the Sea Grant Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first Environmental Advisory Board of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Pacific Science Congress, the President‚Äôs National Commission on Materials Policy, the Science Advisory Board for the Great Lakes of the International Joint Commission, as chair of the first Commission on Environmental Policy, Law and Administration for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and as advisor to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the UNESCO working program for the environmental education and training of engineers. He also served on the editorial boards of numerous prestigious scientific and professional journals. A lover of nature, bird watching, and botany from an early age, he was a founding member of the South Bend, Indiana chapter of the Audubon Society, and of both the first local chapter of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in New York, and the Conservancy's Indiana Chapter. He served on the Board of Governors of TNC from 1959 to 1965.

A small number of these were in Ace Double format, but the majority are single volumes. Between 1952 and 1968, the books had a letter-series identifier; after that date they were given five digit numeric serial numbers, and it is these books that are listed below. The list is probably very incomplete. The list given here gives a date of publication; in all cases this refers to the date of publication by Ace, and not the date of original publication of the novels.

Description Total length is 12‚Äì26 in (30‚Äì66 cm). It is pale gray, light brown, or beige in color, with dark grey or brown blotches on the back and sides. The night snake's head is rather flat and triangular-shaped and usually has a pair of dark brown blotches on the neck. It also has a black or dark brown bar behind the eyes that contrast against the white or pale gray upper labial scales, and the pupil of the eye is vertical. The belly is white or yellowish. Females are usually longer and heavier than males. Geographic range The night snake has been found as far north as southern British Columbia, and as far south as Guerrero, Mexico. The eastern range of the night snake extends to Texas. Still, not much is known as far as population densities and exact range due to the highly cryptic nature of the night snake. Habitat The night snake is found in many differing types of habitat including: grasslands, deserts, sagebrush flats, chaparral, woodlands, thorn scrub, thorn forest, and mountain meadows. Both rocky and sandy areas are inhabited by night snakes, and elevations over have been recorded. The night snake is also known to inhabit mammal burrows. Behavior Night snakes are known to be both crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk), and nocturnal. They are usually seen at night while crossing roads, but can be found under rocks, boards, dead branches and other surface litter during the day. Night snakes hibernate during the winter months, and are known to aestivate during periods of the summer. They are generally most active from April to October, with peaks of activity usually occurring in June. Venom Although the night snake poses no threat to humans, it is slightly venomous and uses this venom to subdue its prey. Diet Their main prey is lizards. A study in southwestern Idaho found that the night snake's diet consisted mostly of side- blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) and their eggs. Other prey includes juvenile rattlesnakes and blind snakes, salamanders, frogs, and large insects. Defense If threatened, the night snake may coil up and thrust its coils at the threat, while flattening its head into a triangular defensive shape. Reproduction Night snakes mate in the spring, and females lay a clutch of 2‚Äì9 eggs from April to August. Eggs hatch in 7 to 8 weeks, usually in late summer. Males reach sexual maturity after one year. Captivity Night snakes are known to be docile and easily handled. Captive night snakes have lived over 12 years.

Flashman explains that this is because the story was plagiarised from him by its author, Anthony Hope. In a letter, Fraser wrote that during his researches into an earlier Flashman book he had discovered that in real life Bismarck and Lola Montez had been in London at the same time.

The reaction commonly involves conversion between a naphthalene-like structure into a fulvalene-like structure, that is, two rings that share an edge vs two separate rings that have vertices bonded to each other. thumb Stone‚ÄìWales defect in 2D silica (HBS, middle) and graphene (bottom): model and TEM images. The reaction occurs on carbon nanotubes, graphene, and similar carbon frameworks, where the four adjacent six-membered rings of a pyrene-like region are changed into two five-membered rings and two seven-membered rings when the bond uniting two of the adjacent rings rotates. In these materials, the rearrangement is thought to have important implications for the chemical, electrical, and mechanical properties. The rearrangement is an example of a pyracyclene rearrangement.  History  The defect is named after Anthony Stone and David J. Wales at the University of Cambridge, who described it in a 1986 paper on the isomerization of fullerenes. However, a similar defect was described much earlier by Peter Thrower in a paper on defects in graphite. For this reason, the term Stone‚ÄìThrower‚ÄìWales defect is sometimes used.  Structural effects  The defects have been imaged using scanning tunneling microscopy and transmission electron microscopy and can be determined using various vibrational spectroscopy techniques. It has been proposed that the coalescence process of fullerenes or carbon nanotubes may occur through a sequence of such a rearrangements. The defect is thought to be responsible for nanoscale plasticity and the brittle‚Äìductile transitions in carbon nanotubes.  Chemical details  The activation energy for the simple atomic motion that gives the bond-rotation apparent in a Stone‚ÄìWales defects is fairly high‚Äîa barrier of several electronvolts. but various processes can create the defects at substantially lower energies than might be expected. The rearrangement creates a structure with less resonance stabilization among the sp2 atoms involved and higher strain energy in the local structure. As a result, the defect creates a region with greater chemical reactivity, including acting as a nucleophile and creating a preferred site for binding to hydrogen atoms. The high affinity of these defects for hydrogen, coupled with the large surface area of the bulk material, might make these defects an important aspect in the use of carbon nanomaterials for hydrogen storage.

He was a graduate of Brooklyn Technical High School. After serving as an infantry corporal in the U.S. Army in World War II, he attended the University of Kentucky, graduating in 1949 summa cum laude, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He was awarded a First Year Graduate Fellowship to Harvard University, where he studied comparative literature, particularly Dante's Divine Comedy. Studying the poems of Robert Frost, he noticed that the first two poems in Frost's book West-Running Brook, \\"Spring Pools\\" and \\"The Freedom of the Moon\\", not only discuss reflecting, but the rhyme schemes of the two reflect each other: AABCBC and CBCBAA. When he met Frost, he was delighted to find that they had both committed the 193 lines of John Milton's \\"Lycidas\\" to memory. His first work at IBM was in the design of IBM's first time-sharing system, which became a very early host to IVSYS (for Iverson system), a predecessor of APL. In 1968, he became a colleague of Ken Iverson, used Iverson notation before APL was named, and was active in the very earliest days of APL. He holds (3 September 1968) \\"Information Transfer Control System\\" allowing communication between two users. In 1978, he left IBM and joined I. P. Sharp Associates, retiring therefrom in 1990. At IBM, McDonnell devised the notation for the signum and circle functions in APL, designed the complex floor function, and proposed the extension of or and and to GCD and LCM. With Iverson he was responsible for including hooks and forks in J. The result of zero divided by zero in J is as he proposed in 1976. In 1987, he won the Iverson Award. McDonnell was the publisher of the APL Press, producing \\"A Source Book in APL\\" and \\"APL Quote Quad, the Early Years\\". He was the editor and principal contributor of the Recreational APL column in APL Quote-Quad for many years. He wrote dozens of the \\"At Play with J\\" columns in Vector, the journal of the British APL Association. He contributed to Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. He was a member of the Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA), and gave a talk \\"Classical Persuasion\\" at the JASNA meeting at Lake Louise in 1993.

The Trial Division of the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all civil matters over $10,000 and criminal matters not assigned to the Court of Common Pleas and adjudication of land interests. The Supreme Court also handles disciplinary and other special proceedings. The Supreme Court comprises a Chief Justice, Arthur Ngiraklsong, and three Associate Justices, Kathleen M. Salii, M.

History Palau Supreme Court was created in 1981, pursuant to Article X of the Constitution. Mamoru Nakamura was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Educated in Hawaii and Oregon, Justice Nakamura worked in a variety of legal capacities in Micronesia before being appointed the first Micronesian Associate Justice of the High Court of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. He served as Palau's first Chief Justice from 1981 until his death in 1992. In 1992, President Ngiratkel Etpison appointed to the Supreme Court the current Chief Justice, Arthur Ngiraklsong. The Court sits in Koror, with certain arguments being heard forty-five minutes away in Palau's capital, Melekeok. The building housing the Court in Koror was built by the Japanese Administration, beginning around 1922. The building served as the Palau District Branch government building, and included tax collection and administration offices. The basement of the building served as a jail, and a formal garden filled an interior yard. The building also housed a local court, presided over by one judge. The South Seas Administration appellate court was also located in Koror. The judge of the Koror local court also served as the Chief Justice of the Appellate Court. While much of Koror was destroyed in World War II, the Court building survived. In recent years, the Court complex has expanded, with annexes named after Pablo Ringang, presiding judge of the Justice Court and the District Court, and after former Chief Justice Nakamura.

The Old (or First) Statistical Account of Scotland was published between 1791 and 1799 by Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster. The New (or Second) Statistical Account of Scotland published under the auspices of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland between 1834 and 1845. These first two Statistical Accounts of Scotland are among the finest European contemporary records of life during the agricultural and industrial revolutions. A Third Statistical Account of Scotland was published between 1951 and 1992. Early attempts O.S.A. Population table for Pencaitland, East Lothian O.S.A. Life expectancy table for Tranent, East Lothian O.S.A. Rent & Produce for Cramond, Midlothian Attempts at getting an accurate picture of the geography, people and economy of Scotland had been attempted in the 1620s and 1630s, using the network of about 900 ministers of the established Church of Scotland. The time and resources involved, not to mention the troubled times of the Civil Wars, led to limited results. =Sir Robert Sibbald (1684‚Äì1690s)= However, the Geographer Royal for Scotland, Sir Robert Sibbald took this forward between 1684 and the early 1690s. Sir Robert circulated some \\"General Queries\\" to parish ministers, but again this was the unsettled time of the Glorious Revolution and, though progress was made, the results provided a very incomplete picture of the nation. =The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (1720‚Äì1755)= The General Assembly proposed a \\"Geographical Description of Scotland\\" and took some action on this between 1720 and 1744, again during troubled times for the country, latterly involving the Jacobite rebellion under Bonnie Prince Charlie. Nonetheless, during 1743, the Moderator of the General Assembly, the Rev Robert Wallace organised the distribution of questionnaires, aimed at finding out how to devise a scheme for the support of the widows and orphans of clergy. This work helped to develop actuarial methods, and explains the involvement of a society for ministers‚Äô widows and orphans in later work. The Rev Alexander Webster produced a population census of Scotland in 1755, based to some extent on Wallace's work. =Sir James Steuart (1767) and David Erskine (1781)= In 1767, Sir James Denham-Steuart suggested a national survey in his \\"Enquiry into the principles of ≈íconomy\\" and this was taken up in 1781 by David Erskine, Earl of Buchan. However, by the time this came to fruition in 1792, it had been overtaken by the work of Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster. The First (Old) Statistical Account of Scotland Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster had studied German state surveys and wished to use what he called for the first time these \\"statistical\\" methods to measure the quantum of happiness that existed in the nation and find ways of improving this. In this he was a remarkable example of Enlightenment idealism at work. He stressed the empirical ideal of that age by lauding its anxious attention to the facts and he set about completing the work left unachieved by the previous attempt mentioned above. The results are crucial to an understanding of Scotland on the eve of both the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. In 1790, Sir John sent structured questionnaires to over 900 parish ministers, covering the whole country. This contained 160 questions in 4 sections, namely * Geography and topography * Population * Agricultural and Industrial production * Miscellaneous questions There were follow up questions in Appendices ‚Äì six new questions in 1790 and four more in 1791. The general response was excellent, though the length and quality of submissions varied greatly, as can be seen by comparing those for two East Lothian parishes: Whittingehame (19 pages with detailed tables) and Stenton (2 pages of minimal information). Since the survey was not complete, Sir John sent out Statistical Missionaries in 1796 . The project was finished by June 1799, though much had already been published, and Sir John was able to lay before the General Assembly a detailed portrait of the nation. Taken as a whole, the reports are of inestimable historical value. Some are excellently written by ministers who were themselves meticulous Enlightenment scholars (see for example the response by the Rev Dr James Meek for the Parish of Cambuslang in Lanarkshire). The finished volumes were published in Edinburgh by William Creech.Statistical Accounts of Scotland: Sir John Sinclair The Second (New) Statistical Account of Scotland As mentioned above, early attempts at producing an accurate statistical account of Scotland were related to schemes to support the widows and orphans of the clergy. In 1832 the Committee for the Society for the Sons and Daughters of the Clergy, with the blessing of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, took Sir John's work further. It was to be more modern (including maps for each county) and was to draw upon the specialist knowledge of local doctors and schoolmasters. It very self- consciously set out not to produce a new statistical account, but a statistical account of a new country ‚Äì one that the revolutions mentioned above had changed rapidly. It was, however, very much the child of the \\"Old Statistical Account\\". Indeed, the Rev Dr John Robertson, the Minister responsible for of the new account for Cambuslang, was the former assistant to the writer of the old account. The Third Statistical Account of Scotland Following a grant of some ¬£8,000 from the Nuffield FoundationThird Statistical Account of Scotland.\\" The Scottish Historical Review, vol. 26, no. 101, 1947, pp. 86‚Äì89 in 1947, the Third Statistical Account was initiated, and followed a similar parish format to the earlier accounts. The first volume, covering Ayrshire, was published in 1951. Ultimately it was more rigorous and wide- ranging than either of its predecessors, covering industry, transport, culture and demographics. Volume editors ensured a more generic approach than before, but even so the spirit of the originals was retained, even if idiosyncrasies remained. The scale of the project, ongoing difficulties with funding and finding publishers (which included Collins and Oliver & Boyd) meant that the project took over forty years to complete, with a gap of more than a decade following the publication of Edinburgh in 1966. It was not until 1992 that the last volume, The County of Roxburgh, was published, under the auspices of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. Another consequence of this delay was that the later volumes covered administrative divisions which no longer existed. Several parish accounts had to be revised or rewritten due to the lapse of time between the fieldwork and publication. One account, the parish of Livingston in West Lothian, was revised twice and all three versions appear in the published volume. The account for the parish of Currie went missing by the time the Midlothian volume was put together and the book appears without it. Although the project was more secular than before, sections of the accounts continued to focus on religious life, and several of the parish accounts were still written by Church of Scotland ministers. The tone of the comments in the 'Way of Life' often appear surprisingly judgmental to a modern reader, and there can be ill-concealed exasperation with the behaviour of working-class parishioners. For example, again and again, spending on football pools is denounced, as are other ways of spending money and leisure time. Judgmentalism turns to plain insult in remarks like 'The people of Dura Den can be extremely ignorant' (Parish of Kemback, Fife) and 'Singing in the schools and the church is painful to an educated ear' (Parish of Inch, Wigtownshire).

History The Vronskiy was built in 1978 as the Prinses Beatrix by Verolme Shipyard, in Heusden, The Netherlands and worked for Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland on its joint Sealink route between Hoek van Holland and Harwich, Parkeston Quay. She was named and launched by Princess Beatrix on 14 January 1978. Brittany Ferries bought the vessel on 1 October 1985 and, after chartering it for a year back to SMZ, renamed it Duc de Normandie, operating between Portsmouth and Ouistreham from 5 June 1986. The ferry sailed alongside on its favoured route to Ouistreham. On 10 July 2002, she was transferred to the Plymouth-Roscoff route, replacing the . She ended her Brittany Ferries career on this route, her final sailing being on 30 September 2004. Particular features of the Duc were a calvados still in the Alambic bar and a cider press at the wine bar. Brittany Ferries sold the Duc in 2005 to TransEuropa Ferries, operating between Port of Ramsgate and Ostend under the name Wisteria. In 2006 she was chartered to Ferrimaroc and Acciona Trasmeditarranea for use on their Almeria (Spain) to Nador (Morocco) route. The vessel sailed on the Nador- Almeria route until September 2013 under the name Vronskiy, where it had operated till 2008 during the summer-season while Transeuropa Ferries operated it on the Oostend-Ramsgate route during the rest of the year. Until 2013 the owner of the ship was Wisteria Hawthorn Shipping but after TEF went bankrupt in April 2013 it was sold to Nizhniy Shipping, which renamed it Vronskiy, although the existing charter to Acciona was continued.

The programme has been on the air since 1 January 1968 (there were no broadcasts from August 1991 to December 1994) and was broadcast in color since 1974. Editorial line In the Soviet days of Vremya, the programme had a pro-government bias and typically did not report on news that could potentially fuel anti- government sentiment. The programme presented reports that promoted socialism and portrayed the West in a negative manner. The newsroom was tied to the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee. This situation changed after Glasnost, when a director of news was introduced alongside the news being sourced from official outlets. This made CT USSR report accurately on the collapse of the Soviet Union's satellite communist countries in Eastern Europe in 1989. This also made Vremya to be shown uncensored and critical, triggering the protests that hastened the end of the Soviet Union. Schedule and popularity Vremya is produced in three daily editions, scheduled for transmission in Moscow at 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00 local time (= UTC+3), the last of these having been the programme's main edition ever since its inception in 1968. Given the country's vast size (it stretches over eleven time zones) editions of Vremya are also broadcast (either live or deferred) at Moscow time plus two, four, six, and eight hours, according to locality.Soviet television: a new asset for Kremlin watchers p. 48; 7days.ru Interview with Ekatherina Andreeva During the Soviet era, the programme's main edition was also carried simultaneously on the primary channel of each republican station: Azeri Television, Belarus 1, Eesti Televisioon, Georgian Public Broadcasting, Kazakhstan-1, Channel 1 of the Kiev Telecentre, LTV1, Lithuanian National Radio and Television, Uzbekistan 1, etc. The broadcast lasts 30 minutes, but in special circumstances (more especially during the Soviet era), the broadcast is extended beyond the 30 minutes allotted when necessary (such as the Red Square state ceremonies and parades, CPSU Party Congress telecasts together with other CPSU-led activities, plenary sessions of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and deaths of Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko). Even highlights of the celebrations of the Union-wide holidays were also broadcast. Starting in the mid-1970s, another 30-minute edition was presented on the All-Union Programme (launched in 1956) around 11:00pm. (This was in the form of a live simulcast of Vremya in the next Orbita transmission zone, occasionally a repeat of the 9:00pm programme, especially in the European USSR.) Prior to that, both channels aired Vremya simultaneously at 9:00pm, then repeated the next morning when the First Programme signed on around 7:30am (later 6:30am) after the exercise programme, before airing children's programming and schools and colleges programmes, all produced together with the USSR Ministry of Education and were also seen on Programme 4. Later, a live morning edition was shown at 6:30am, before the breakfast programme 120 minut (which continues today on Channel One Russia as Dobroye Utro, Russian: ) on weekdays (on weekends Vremya aired at 8:00 am after sign-on). News summaries were added as the transmissions increased during the day. There was a bulletin at the end of the morning and midday programmes (i.e. around 1:00pm), an afternoon edition at 3:00pm, and another at 6:30pm on the first channel. From 1989, the latter bulletin began to use the two presenter format of Vremya, as well as the Vremya moniker, and its corresponding studio and graphics (including the title sequence and theme music), looking as it was the program's first edition (the 6:30 am program was the morning news edition while the one at 1 PM was the midday update), with the 9:00 pm telecast as the second (main) edition and the one at 11:00 pm as the third or late edition or the late night replay. The All-Union Programme's daytime schedule always began with the news at around 15:00. Midnight newscasts did not appear until the 1980s, when the First Programme screened a headline update preceding the closedown sequence, usually after midnight. All of these bulletins were known as Novosti (Russian: , \\"The News\\"). From 1989, the 15:00 news round-up on the All-Union Programme and the midnight news round-up on the First Programme were known as TSN: Television News Service (Russian: TCH: , TSN:Televizionnaya sluzhba novostey), which ended in 1991. Today the news on Channel One Russia follows a similar schedule to this one, with Vremya, Novosti, and the all-Russian and regional news updates. The majority of Russians rely on Vremya as a trusted news source. Between 1981 and 1983 and since 1986, Vremya has used the theme song from Time, Forward! as its signature tune and opening sequence. In a two-week test that lasted from 12 to 26 February 1990 more than 100 PBS member stations across the United States broadcast Vremya. The test was coordinated by WGBH- TV. Coverage during the last days of the USSR After the introduction of the glasnost and perestroika, Vremya loosened its fidelity to the party line and began presenting fair reports about the events transforming Eastern Europe at the time. On 15 March 1989 150 million Soviet citizens watched as the station aired an 85-page speech by Gorbachev to a plenum of the CPSU Central Committee criticizing the poor state of agriculture and setting out the case for reforms, the highlights of that address being featured on that day's telecast. In the 1980s, 86% of Soviet adults relied on television coverage as their primary source of news. Yet Vremya was seen as \\"a joke\\" by many Soviet citizens due to its poor coverage of news events. The coverage of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, for example, was often relegated to lesser news items during the ongoing coverage of the disaster; in contrast, western news media such as CBS Evening News led with the story for six consecutive weekdays. Following the evacuation of the nuclear workers' closed city of Pripyat, Vremya issued the following brief announcement: In 1987 the program logo appeared for the first time in its studio. 1988 saw a big change for the newscast as its studios featured picture backdrops for the first time, and debuted a new logo, with a styled letter –í in a box (this was the year of its 20th anniversary). On 19 August 1991 it showed pictures of the impending coup d'etat in Moscow for the first time, albeit in the new styled studios which opened in 1990. Vremya covered highlights of the March 1989 elections for the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union and the sessions of the Congress in Moscow, making interviews with its leadership and deputies. Transition The last Soviet-era Vremya newscast was broadcast on 27 August 1991 and replaced with another news programme known as TV-Inform (ru: ) the following day. The closure was due to pressure from RSFSR President Boris Yeltsin claiming that the programme was \\"too tied to the CPSU\\", but according to the news anchors themselves it was due to CT USSR being forced to lay off a large number of their staff which were said to be KGB agents. When the USSR dissolved in December that year, the programme, now Novosti Ostankino, changed broadcasters from Soviet Central Television to the new Ostankino Television 1 and 4. It stayed even until after the network's name change to ORT-1 (Public Russian Television-1, Russian: , Obshchestvennoe Rossiyskoe Televidenie) in November 1994, and Ostankino 4's reformatting into NTV that same year. Vremya returned on 16 December 1994, in time to report on the looming conflict in Chechenya. The format was then changed to that of a single-presenter one, but the dual-presenter one was kept for special editions of the program, and was even incorporated into the newscast's 1995-99 opening sequence. Special New Year's Day openers debuted in 1998, in celebration of the program's 30th anniversary. On 1 January 2018 the program celebrated its 50th anniversary. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the studio and congratulated the staff for the occasion. Sunday Vremya On Sundays since the late 1980s, the programme also has a separate Sunday edition, initially called Seven Days (, Sem' d'nei), since 2003 known as Sunday Vremya (, Voskresnoe Vremya, Sunday Time). This programme also airs a roundup of the week's news. Until its launch, Vremya was shown as per Monday-Saturday. Sunday Vremya debuted on the then Programme One of Soviet Central Television in 1989.

History  = Establishment = The Reuter Organ Company was founded in 1917 by A.C. Reuter, Earl Schwartz and Henry Jost as the Reuter-Schwartz Organ Company in Trenton, Illinois. A.C. Reuter held positions at Wicks, Pilcher and Casavant Fr√®res from about 1904. Reuter's nephew, A.G. Sabol, left Casavant to work for his uncle's firm shortly after the company's founding. The company had four other employees at the time of its founding besides Reuter and Sabol, they were Jake Schaeffer, a voicer from Casavant, E.J. \\"Pat\\" Netzer, wood worker, William Zweifel, pipe maker, and Frank Jost, console builder. The first Reuter was completed in 1917, and was the firm's only organ built that year; the instrument consisted of eight stops over two manuals and pedals, and was sold to Trinity Episcopal Church in Mattoon, Illinois. While the organ sat in the erecting room a tornado struck Trenton, and blew out one of the factory walls. The assembled organ suffered severe damage. The company carried insurance, and neither the church, nor Reuter incurred any financial loss. A new instrument, opus 2, was built and set up in Trinity Episcopal. = Move to Kansas = In March 1919, Carl Preyer, head of the piano department of the University of Kansas, was in St. Louis to perform with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. Following his concert, Preyer traveled to Trenton, Illinois to visit the Reuter factory at the invitation of Sam Bihr, the Reuter representative for Kansas. While in Trenton, Preyer learned that Reuter was contemplating a move. Lawrence, Kansas was one of three sites being considered for a future location. During the installation at the Masonic Temple in April 1919, Preyer convinced the company officials to select Lawrence as its new home. The Wilder Brothers shirt factory, vacant at the time, was purchased as the new Reuter headquarters. While the factory in Lawrence was being prepared, the employees in Trenton started the arduous task of dismantling, crating and loading all of the equipment and furnishings. Eventually it took eight railway boxcars to move the production operation from Trenton to Lawrence. On September 5, 1919, the company was incorporated in the State of Kansas. The board of directors was listed as E.G Schwartz, A.C. Reuter, H.T. Jost, G.O. Foster, and W.B Downing. Foster and Downing were both with the University of Kansas. The Lawrence Chamber of Commerce had pledged funds to help defray the cost of moving. On January 1, 1920, the new office was open for business, and on March 1 the remodeled factory opened for production. The city of Lawrence could now boast that it was one of the few communities in the nation with a pipe organ factory. The first instrument built in the Lawrence plant was opus 27, a 23-rank organ for the Central Congregational Church in Topeka, Kansas. On July 3, 1920, the Lawrence community was invited to a public recital on the completed instrument in the assembly room. The performers were Professor C. S. Skilton, Professor C. Preyer, and Mrs. Sylvia Osborn at the console; Professor W.B. Downing and Miss Helmick sang solos; and Mr. W.B. Dalton played the cello. Shortly after the move to Kansas, Earl Schwartz left the company, and Schwartz's name was dropped, and the company became The Reuter Organ Company. During the era of silent films, the company built a few dozen theatre organs. During the 1940s-1960s, architectural engineer George Albert Sabol worked at the plant and eventually supervised as company president. = New factory = On June 4, 2001, Chairman of the Board Albert Neutel officially opened Reuter's new $4 million headquarters on the northwest edge of town; a building with double the space of the old Wilder Bros. shirt factory. The company has organs in the United States, Canada, Taiwan, and Korea.

It is considered to be one of the earliest and most basal cynodonts. It was 60 cm (2 ft) long and seems to have been adapted to a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Remains of Procynosuchus have been found in Germany, Zambia and South Africa.T. S. Kemp: The Origin and Evolution of Mammals Oxford University Press, 2005. Paleobiology P. delaharpeae restoration As one of the earliest cynodonts, Procynosuchus has many primitive features, but it also has features that distinguish it from all other early therapsids. Some of these features have been interpreted as adaptations for a semi-aquatic lifestyle. For example, the wide zygapophyses of the vertebrae allow for a high degree of lateral flexibility, and Procynosuchus may have used anguilliform locomotion, or eel-like undulation, to swim through the water. The tail of Procynosuchus is also unusually long for a cynodont. The long haemal arches would have given the tail a large lateral surface area for greater propulsion through the water. Relatively flat foot bones may also have been an adaptation toward swimming, as the feet may have been used like paddles. Ridges on the femur are an indication of strong flexor muscles that could have stabilized the leg during limb-driven swimming. When the thigh is pulled back in the water, the lower leg tends to bend forward. Strong flexor muscles would have pulled the lower leg back with the femur, providing the powerful backward thrust that is needed to swim. Discovery Model (right) Procynosuchus was named by South African paleontologist Robert Broom in 1937. Broom also named the cynodont Cyrbasiodon in 1931. Another genus, Parathrinaxodon, was named by Parrington in 1936. These genera are now regarded as synonyms of Procynosuchus, as they represent the same animal. Under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), these two names take precedence over Procynosuchus because they were erected earlier. The names Cyrbasiodon and Parathrinaxodon were rarely used after their erection, while the name Procynosuchus has since become widespread in scientific literature. In a case brought to the ICZN in 2009, some scientists proposed that Procynosuchus should be a nomen conservandum, or conserved name, making Cyrbasiodon and Parathrinaxodon nomina rejecta, or rejected names. In 2010, the ICZN formally made Procynosuchus a nomen conservandum.

They include naval battles, the Allied conquest of German colonial possessions in the Pacific Ocean and China, and an anti-Russian rebellion in Russian Turkestan. The most significant military action was the careful and well- executed Siege of Tsingtao in China, but smaller actions were also fought at Bita Paka and Toma in German New Guinea. All other German and Austrian possessions in Asia and the Pacific fell without bloodshed. Naval warfare was common; all of the colonial powers had naval squadrons stationed in the Indian or Pacific Oceans. These fleets operated by supporting the invasions of German-held territories and by destroying the East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy. Allied offensives =Tsingtao = The German front line at Tsingtao. Tsingtao was the most significant German base in the area. It was defended by 3,650 German troops supported by 100 Chinese colonial troops and Austro-Hungarian soldiers and sailors occupying a well-designed fort. Supporting the defenders were a small number of vessels from the Imperial German Navy and the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Japanese sent nearly their entire fleet to the area, including six battleships and 23,000 soldiers. The British sent two military units to the battle from their garrison at Tientsin, numbering 1,500, and the Chinese who were unoccupied by the Germans sent over a few thousand troops on the side of the allies. The bombardment of the fort started on October 31 1914. An assault was made by the Imperial Japanese Army on the night of November 6. The garrison surrendered the next day. Casualties of the battle were 703 on the German side and some 3,600 POW; casualties on the Allied side were 2,066. One Allied protected cruiser was also sunk by a German torpedo boat and when defeat was certain, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians scuttled their squadron. =Pacific= Colonies and influence zones in Asia and the South Pacific in 1914 One of the first land offensives in the Pacific theatre was the invasion of German Samoa on 29‚Äì30 August 1914 by New Zealand forces. The campaign to take Samoa ended without bloodshed after over 1,000 New Zealanders landed on the German colony, supported by an Australian and French naval squadron. Australian forces attacked German New Guinea in September 1914: 500 Australians encountered 300 Germans and native policemen at the Battle of Bita Paka; the Allies won the day and the Germans retreated to Toma. A company of Australians and a British warship besieged the Germans and their colonial subjects, ending with German Governor Eduard Haber's surrender of the entire colony.https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww1/aif/vol9/awmohww1-aif- vol9-ch5.pdf Despite Haber's capitulation order, a variety of isolated German units in New Guinea continued to resist after the fall of Toma. These small German forces generally capitulated without bloodshed once confronted by Australian units. On 11 October 1914, the German armed yacht Komet and her 57 crew surrendered after their ship was boarded taken by surprise at Talasea.https://www.navyhistory.org.au/sms-komet-the-rans-first-captured- warship-a-valuable-prize-and-our-first-aircraft-carrier/ In December 1914, a German officer near Angorum attempted to resist the Allied occupation with thirty native police but his force deserted him after they fired on an Australian scouting party and he was subsequently captured. By 1915, the only uncapitulated German force was a small expedition under the command of Hermann Detzner which managed to elude Australian patrols and hold out in the interior of the island until the end of the war, for which he became a figure of some renown. Micronesia, the Marianas, the Carolines and the Marshall Islands also fell to Allied forces during the war.  German naval actions  =Retreat of the German East Asia Squadron=  In the Pacific  Scharnhosts and Gneisenaus path across the Pacific. When war was declared on Germany in 1914, the German East Asia Squadron withdrew from its base at Tsingtao and attempted to make its way east across the Pacific and back to Germany. After concentrating the majority of its force at Pagan Island, the fleet raided several Allied targets as it made its way across the Pacific. Detached cruisers raided the cable station at Fanning and then rejoined with the squadron. Later the German forces would attack Papeete where Admiral Maximilian von Spee with his two armoured cruisers sank a French gunboat and a freighter before bombarding Papeete's shore batteries.  Chile and the Falklands  The next engagement was fought off Chile at the Battle of Coronel on November 1, 1914, Admiral Spee won the battle by defeating a British squadron which was sent to destroy him. His two armored and three light cruisers sank two Royal Navy armored cruisers and forced a British light cruiser and auxiliary cruiser to flee. Over 1,500 British sailors (all hands aboard both cruisers) were killed while only three Germans were wounded. The victory did not last long as the German fleet was soon defeated in Atlantic waters at the Battle of the Falklands in December 1914. Spee himself went down with his own flagship . The only German vessels to escape the Falklands engagement was the light cruiser Dresden and the auxiliary Seydlitz. Seydlitz fled into the Atlantic before being interned by neutral Argentina, while Dresden turned about and steamed back into the Pacific. The Dresden then attempted to act as a commerce raider, without much success, until March 1915 when its engines began to break down. Without means of getting repairs, the German light cruiser sailed into neutral Chilean waters at the island of Mas a Tierra where it was cornered by British naval forces. After a short battle in which four of her crew were killed, the Dresden was forced to scuttle and her crew was interned by Chilean authorities. =SMS Emden in the Indian Ocean= the Emden. SMS Emden was left behind by Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee when he began his retreat across the Pacific. The ship won the Battle of Penang, in which the Germans sank a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. Emden also harried merchant vessels of the Allies and destroyed over thirty of them. She went on and bombarded Madras, India, causing damage to British oil tanks and sinking an Allied merchant ship. The attack caused widespread panic in the city and thousands of people fled from the coast, fearing that the Germans may have begun an invasion of India as a whole. After a very successful career as a merchant raider, Emden was engaged by at the Battle of Cocos, where the German vessel was destroyed. A group of sailors under the command of Hellmuth von M√ºcke managed to escape towards the Arabian peninsula which was then part of the Ottoman Empire, an ally of the German Empire during World War I. =The cruise of SMS Seeadler= The SMS Seeadler, an auxiliary cruiser windjammer and merchant raider, commanded by Felix von Luckner managed successful attacks on Allied shipping in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. During her career she captured sixteen vessels and sank most of them. In August 1917 SMS Seeadler was wrecked at the island of Mopelia in French Polynesia so the Germans established a small colony on the island which housed them and several Allied prisoners, most of whom were American. Eventually when starvation proved to be an urgent concern, Luckner and his crew left the prisoners on the uninhabited island, from which they were eventually rescued, and set sail in a lifeboat for Fiji. There, on September 5, Luckner captured a French schooner named Lutece and renamed her Fortuna. After that they headed for Easter Island and again their ship was wrecked when it grounded on a reef. Subsequently, the Germans were interned by the Chileans on October 5, 1917 which ended the journey. During the entire cruise only one man perished, due to an accident. =The scuttling of SMS Cormoran at Guam= SMS Cormoran The United States was involved in at least one hostile encounter with Germans in the Pacific during World War I. On April 7, 1917, the SMS Cormoran was scuttled in Apra Harbor, Guam to prevent her capture by the auxiliary cruiser . The Americans fired their first shots of the war at the Germans as they attempted to sink their ship. Ultimately the Germans succeeded in scuttling the Cormoran with a loss of nine men dead.  Russia  Monument dedicated to the memory of the Urkun massacre in Victoria park, Karakol, Kyrgyzstan In June 1916, Tsar Nicholas II adopted a draft of conscripting Central Asian men from the age of 19 to 43 into labor battalions for the service in support of the ongoing Brusilov Offensive. As a result, a revolt broke out on July 3 among the Muslim inhabitants of Russian Turkestan against the Russian authorities. Russia was forced to divert several thousand soldiers from the Eastern Front to suppress the rebellion, which ended in February 1917. Suppression of the rebels was typified by general massacres against the local population. This was followed by the expulsion of the surviving Kyrgyz and Kazakh from Russian Turkestan toward China; many of the refugees died along the way while attempting to cross the Tian Shan mountains. The revolt resulted in around 100,000 to 270,000 dead among the Kyrgyz population.  China  The German government was accused of being behind Zhang Xun's monarchist coup in China to prevent Duan Qirui's pro-war faction from supporting the Allies. After the coup failed in July 1917, Duan used the incident as a pretext for declaring war on Germany. The German and Austro-Hungarian concessions in Tientsin and Hankow were occupied and their nationals detained. China also supplied civilian laborers to the Allies for mainly non-combat and auxiliary roles on the Western Front.  Siam  On 22 July 1917, Siam declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary. Twelve German vessels docked in Siamese ports were immediately seized. The crews and other Central Power nationals were detained and sent to India to join their fellow citizens in British India's existing civilian internment camps. Siam was the sole country in Southeast Asia to maintain full independence from the great empires during the colonial era. It was the only state in the region to enter the conflict entirely of its own free will, as an equal of the European powers rather than as part of their imperial contingents.

It requires players to determine a common bond between three subjects. It follows in the tradition of Trivial Pursuit, Outburst and other adult boardgames that require a wide range of knowledge but TriBond requires some problem solving ability as well. History TriBond was invented by Tim Walsh, Dave Yearick, and Ed Muccini. The idea first came to them in 1987 while they were students at Colgate University. The inspiration came when they learned that John Haney and Ed Werner, who invented Trivial Pursuit, had also attended Colgate. They wanted to invent a game that provided an intellectual challenge but also had a broader appeal than games of straight trivia questions that had been very popular in the 80's. Within two years, they had their first prototype of TriBond and were ready to market the game. Initial marketing for the game was difficult. Parker Brothers, Mattel, Tyco and several other game companies all turned TriBond down. At the time they were working with Patch Products to manufacture the game. Tim Walsh talked them into hiring him on as a marketing manager to sell TriBond. With some clever promoting techniques they were able to sell around 150,000 copies of TriBond in 1993. By 1996 TriBond had sold over a million copies. In 2015, for TriBond's 25th Anniversary, Tim Walsh entered into business with Everest Toys in Ancaster, Ontario, Canada. Together the game was revamped to have a more party game type of feel, by adding more fun and exciting ways to play. Since its release, there have been six major releases of TriBond: *TriBond (Original) (1990) *TriBond Diamond Edition (1998) *The Best of TriBond (2001) *TriBond 2005 *Will Shortz TriBond (2009) *Everest Toys TriBond (2015) The game The main feature of the game is the TriBond \\"Threezer\\". This word was invented by the maker of TriBond to describe the three word clues the players must analyze and determine what all three have in common. Some of the threezers are not difficult while others are quite challenging. The threezers originally came in four different categories listed below. * Entertainment * Sports and Recreation * Academics * Miscellaneous With the TriBond 2005 release, the Miscellaneous category was removed and some new categories added. Listed below are the 2005 categories. * Entertainment * Academics * Wordplay * Loose Connections * Sports TriBond can be played by individual players or teams. Each game comes with 12 game pieces, three for each team. The gameboard is unusual, being triangular, and has three start and finish tracks that go around each corner of the board with 17 spaces for each track. All players place each of their three-game pieces on the starting points for each track. Two dice are used, one being a regular, numbered dice and the other a category dice. A player rolls the dice and one of the opposing players will read to them the threezer for the category they rolled. If they are able to guess the common bond they will advance one of their game pieces the number of spaces rolled on the numbered die and continue playing until they answer incorrectly. This rule changed in the 2005 version to 'one question, one turn'. Unless the player lands on a challenge square, it is the next team's turn regardless of whether or not they answered correctly. If the player lands on a green challenge square they can 'challenge' another player who's ahead of them in one of the three tracks. In the first version of TriBond, the card would identify which of the four categories would be the challenge threezer. Starting with the 2005 Edition each card lists an additional challenge threezer along with the other categories. A third player will read the challenge threezer to the challenger and the player he challenged. Whoever shouts out the correct answer first wins the challenge. If the challenger wins, he gets to swap places on the board with the other player, otherwise both players' pieces remain as they are. Challenging is not always possible; if the player is ahead on all three tracks there is no point in offering a challenge to another player. The first player or team to move all their game pieces around the tracks wins the game. Game show An unsold pilot for a television version of TriBond (which was hosted by Graham Elwood) was filmed by Game Show Network in early 2002. Three contestants competed in the game show, which was played in three rounds: * Round 1 ‚Äì Three items were presented, and the contestant who buzzed in had to determine the common bond. 25 points were awarded for each correct bond. * Round 2 ‚Äì The first two items were presented, and the contestant who buzzed in had to determine the third item (which had two possible answers) as well as the common bond. 50 points were awarded for each correct bond. At the end of this round, the lowest- scoring contestant was eliminated from the game. * Round 3 ‚Äì Two contestants competed in this round. The first item was presented, and the contestant who buzzed in had to determine both the second item (which had two possible answers) and the third item (which had three possible answers) as well as the common bond. 100 points were awarded for each correct bond. At the end of the third round, the contestant with the highest number of points was declared the winner and advanced to the bonus round. If there was a tie at the end of the second or third rounds, a tiebreaking bond would be played between the tied contestants under that particular round's rules; the first contestant to buzz in with a correct answer advanced to the next round. =Endgame= The contestant who won the main game was given 45 seconds to identify seven bonds; a correct answer on each bond reveals one of the items that is present in the final bond. The contestant can pass on each bond and return to it, depending on the time remaining. Once the 45 seconds had expired, the contestant was told which three of the seven answers shared a common bond with each other; the contestant was given 10 additional seconds to determine the common bond shared by those answers. If the contestant correctly identified the final common bond, he or she won $10,000.

The first station was known as \\"Higginsville Station\\" built by the Rondout & Oswego railroad company (later known as the Ulster & Delaware (U&D;)). The second station was served by three different railroads, all of which eventually became part of the New York Central railroad company. The third station, known as \\"Fair Street Station\\", replaced the Higginsville Station in 1882. The fourth station was for the New York, Ontario and Western railroad. Higginsville station Located near MP 4.4 on the U&D; at the time of its construction in about 1869, Higginsville was the first station location for Kingston. It was situated just west of the current Washington Avenue. The Rondout & Oswego was Kingston's only railroad at the time. The CMRR plans to rebuild a station at this location as part of its expanding service in Kingston towards the Ashokan reservoir. Union Station The Kingston Union Station The next railroad to serve Kingston was the broad gauge (6 ft) Wallkill Valley Railroad, an affiliate of the Erie system. Following soon afterward was the West Shore Railroad which quickly bought up the Wallkill Valley. Around 1880, at the junction of the West Shore Railroad, Wallkill Valley Railroad and U&D;, Kingston Station, also known as \\"Union Station\\", was built by the West Shore Railroad. Operating costs were shared by New York Central and the U&D; which then discontinued use of the Fair Street Station. Passenger service on the Walkill Valley RR ended in 1937. There was also a nearby subway station for the Colonial City trolley line under the West Shore Railroad tracks. Kingston Station, MP 2.8, became one of the busiest stations serving the U&D.; The U&D; went along the north side of the station while the Wallkill and West Shore ran in front (east) of it. In 1884, the West Shore became a part of the NYC. In 1932, the U&D; ceased to exist and became the Catskill Mountain Branch of the NYC; Kingston Station became an NYC station. In its latter years one morning train a day (except Sundays) ran on the route from Kingston to Oneonta and one afternoon train in the east-bound direction back to Kingston. Passenger service on the old U&D; route ended by the end of 1954.'Official Guide of the Railways,' January 1950, New York Central section, Table 79'Official Guide of the Railways,' December 1954, New York Central section, Table 96 (freight only) NYC West Shore line service in the latter 1950s dwindled to one Kington-Weehawken trip a day in each direction and one full length Albany-Kingston-Weehawken trip a day in each direction;'Official Guide of the Railways,' December 1957, New York Central section, Table 80 and this last passenger service to Kingston ended in 1958. The station was then abandoned. It had deteriorated so badly that it was torn down in the 1960s, although some local groups tried to save it. Fair Street station Located near MP 4.0 on the U&D; at the time of its construction in 1882, Fair Street Station was near the central business district of Kingston. The change from Higginsville to Fair Street was the result of an agreement made in 1881 between Thomas Cornell, as president of the railroad company, and a committee of citizens. Fair Street station closed in 1898. New York, Ontario & Western station In 1902, the New York, Ontario and Western (O&W;) constructed a branch from Summitville to Kingston, and built a station west and slightly north of the site of the U&D;'s early Fair Street Station. Passenger service had already been terminated by 1950.'Official Guide of the Railways,' January 1950, New York, Ontario and Western section This station survived until the railroad was shut down in 1957. The station was torn down in the 1960s. Catskill Mountain Railroad station The Catskill Mountain Railroad, which leases the former Ulster and Delaware Railroad in Ulster County, New York started a special event shuttle in Kingston on December 6, 2008. A small ticket office and loading platform was placed just east of Westbrook Lane, MP 3.78. This ticket office is known as Westbrook Station. Its location is about 1/4 mile east of the former U&D; Fair Street Station.

It often recounts major historical foundations for the study of bureaucracy as well as epistemological issues associated with public service as a profession and as an academic field. Generally speaking, there are three different common approaches to understanding public administration: Classical Public Administration Theory, New Public Management Theory, and Postmodern Public Administration Theory, offering different perspectives of how an administrator practices public administration. Important figures of study include: Max Weber, Frederick Winslow Taylor, Luther Gulick, Mary Parker Follett, Chester Barnard, Herbert A. Simon, and Dwight Waldo. Herbert Simon advanced a public administration theory that was informed by positivism. The influence of positivism today can be seen in journals such as the Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory and the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management.Whetsell, Travis and Patricia M. Shields (forthcoming) \\"The Dynamics of Positivism in the Study of Public Administration: A Brief Intellectual History and Reappraisal, Administration & Society. (doi:10.1177/0095399713490157) Also see Simon, Herbert. 1947 Administrative Behavior Notable Public Administration Theorist such as Max Weber expressed the importance of values in the development of public administration theory. However, theory cannot simply be derived from empirical observation of facts, it must be constructed using value judgments that direct our empirical observations and then guide out interpretation of those observations. Values are essential for the construction of public administration theories because it takes into account the meaningful ethical principles and philosophies of a culture which ensure appropriate theory practice. Public Administration theories are put into practice or considered through a few distinct strategies: Parallel, Transfer, or Collaboration also known as the theory-gap practice. This practice is used to transfer knowledge between practitioners and scholars.  Types of Public Administration Theory  Public Administration Theory recently has been divided into three branches. The three branches are, Classical Public Administration Theory, New Public Management Theory and Postmodern Public Administration Theory. Each of these three branches study Public Administration from a different perspective. These types of theories are some of the ways which an administrator can understand and exercise their duties as a public administrator. = Classical Public Administration Theory = Classical Public Administration is often associated with Woodrow Wilson and Max Weber. In the United States, Woodrow Wilson is known as 'The Father of Public Administration' , having written \\"The Study of Administration\\" in 1887, in which he argued that a bureaucracy should be run like a business. Wilson promoted ideas like merit-based promotions, professionalization, and a non-political system. Sympathy can lead to downfall in an administration, means there should be pragmatism in bureaucracy. = New Public Management Theory = New Public Management a set of administrative practices, a consulting fad, and a body of theory that interprets recent developments in public administration. Many scholars argue persuasively that scholars should pay more attention to New Public management as a theory than as a fad. New public management is part and parcel of the massive intrusion of freemarket values into public space, which threatens to drive out political values altogether. It is worth noting that,in this sense, new public management is the radical opposite of the notion of migrating political values into \\"private\\" space in the interest of further democratizing society. However, new public management theory fails to addresses political questions in a meaningful way. This theory looks at public administration from its roots of capitalism, and goes on through the perspective of global capitalism. Intentional or not, new public management has served the interests of elites, particularly corporate elites, has degraded the ability of governments to address the public interest, and has served as a vehicle for elevating the apolitical governance of free trade and other supranational organizations,which have fully embraced the political philosophy of economic rationalism and new managerialism.  Postmodern Public Administration Theory  Post-modern public administration is referring to the inner workings of nearly every government entity in existence. Whether it is the congress men and women in Washington D.C. or the Department of Public Safety representatives located at any DPS office handling the paper work of applicants wanted to obtain a drivers license. The idea of public administration is broad enough to encompass all government positions that affect the public. Members of public administration come in different forms and quantities. When understanding the theory of postmodern public administration, it is important to make a differentiation between postmodern theory and the postmodern era as well as being able to differentiate between post-modernity (period of time) and postmodernism (theory/philosophy). Postmodern theory evolves out of the postmodern era. Chuck Fox and Hugh Miller are two of the main contributors to postmodern theory because they were able to recognize the postmodern condition and how it was playing out in public administration and public policy. Fox and Miller argue that the traditional approach to public administration \\"robs public administration theorists of the independence required to imagine more emancipating conditions of work and governance.\\" Fox, C.J., & Miller, H.T. (1995). Postmodern public administration: Bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Press. Miller proposes a network model based on economic utility which would explain events better than traditional approach to public administration. Miller states that \\"policy networks provide a way of processing dissension, articulating values, and airing possible policy implementation strategies. Maneuvering on behalf of the public interest in this complex politically subtle network is the task of post-progressive public administration.\\" This theory began in the 1990s, even though this theory had been around in other disciplines for a while. An estimation of time could date back to Plato and his ideas of a public and communal government where there are policy making actions and steps through levels of democracy. This theory has since been revisited and changed through three intellectual movements, interrogating the loop model of democracy, which many have argued that it is largely a myth, showing the symbolic nature of policy and politics in the United States, and discourse theory. One of the downsides of this theory is that it is based on the slippery slope of relativism. This theory also provides people with the tools to rebuild our infrastructures of symbolic and social order. This theory addresses big questions of what is right and wrong and tries to address the issue to find antidotes for anomie and relativity.King, Cheryl (September 7, 2015). \\"Postmodern Public Administration: In The Shadow Of Postmodernism\\".Administrative Theory & Praxis. The founding father of postmodern public administration is commonly referred to as Woodrow Wilson, while many can find his roots of inspiration from the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. Using Woodrow Wilson as a reference point, it can be shown that in his essay The Study of Administration, is it ‚Äútraditionally accepted that with his study, Wilson applied positivist principles to public administration‚Ä¶based on the belief that social reality would be objectively known with the separation of positivist traditional values from facts.‚Äù (Traces of Postmodernism in the New Public Management Paradigm, Kerim Ozcan-Veysel Agca).√ñzcan, Kerim (Sept. 2010). \\"Traces of Postmodernism in the New Public Management Paradigm\\" (PDF).www.todaie.edu. Retrieved April 13, 2016.  Public Administration Theory Development  Public Administration theory is derived from several contemporary theory building tools such as Max Weber's Ideal type method. Theories are also derived from studies of evolving governments around the world, such as China's expanding bureaucracy. Different aspects to take into account are: accountability, state-citizen relations, and services for all in times of fiscal scarcity. When developing theories, the most effective theories are the ones tailored for a particular country taking aspects such as values into account. When empirical evidence is the only aspect taken into account it leads to an ineffective policy because the theory will not reflect the values of the citizens, resulting in bad citizen- state relationships. The Theory-Gap Practice is used to analyze the correlations between Public Administration theory and practice. The three fields of the theory gap-practice that describe the relationship between scholars and practitioners are: Parallel, Transfer, and Collaboration strategy. = Max Weber's Ideal- Type Method = The ideal- type method developed by Max Weber is a useful tool in contemporary public administration theory development because the method takes into account the culture of a society that is then integrated into a theory. Weber referred to it as cultural science or interpretive sociology, which, is to understand ideas and practices from within their own intellectual and cultural horizon and on the basis of categories that are grounded in a meaningful social and historical context. According to Margaret Stout, Ideal-type methods are used to frame observation and analysis and to evaluate what is found. Weber's method must be developed using value judgments that direct our empirical observations and then guide our interpretation of those observations. Through this theory building method, Weber insisted that all interpretations of meaning must remain at best \\"a peculiarly plausible hypothesis\\", as opposed to a claim of relevance of a theory. Weber's purpose for using this method is to clarify the importance of values in sense making, but how they are also extremely important for the conduct of meaningful social science. Weber‚Äôs interpretive sociology employs a type of functional analysis that begins with the whole, proceeds to the parts, and then goes back from the parts to the whole. His ideal-type method is thereby simultaneously useful in both the study of social structure and social action. Social action is linked to subjective meaning at the individual level of analysis, and structural forms are a consequence or construction of social action. This combination is particularly valuable to public administration because the manner in which administrative action and the social structures of governance interrelate requires an approach that considers both. On the one hand, ideal-types enable consideration of things like alternative meanings of important concepts or alternative motivations held by social actors. On the other hand, they enable analysis of associated or resulting social structures. In this way, an ideal- type can concurrently help interpret the meaning of the administrative role as well as critique the institutions of governance. = Theory- Gap Practice = Parallel- Proponents of this strategy of relating theory and practice believe that practical knowledge cannot be derived from theories. For the practitioners of this strategy, practice and theory remain separate components of knowledge. Practical knowledge aims to how to handle problems in particular situations while theory aims at handling a specific situation in a general set of principles. Advocates for the parallel strategy claim there can be a complementary relationship between practical and theoretical knowledge or that they can substitute each other in certain situations because particular situations will require practice and theory to work together. Thus advocates that champion parallel strategy argue that it is essential for management studies to maintain an autonomous communication system. Transfer- This second strategy frames the theory-practice problem as one of translating and diffusing research knowledge into management. This strategy confronts the issue of public managers lack of interest or studying of the work of scholars. This is the result of the scholarly work not being easily applicable to practice, and the complexity of the journals, thus knowledge is not being transferred from theory to practice. The transfer strategy proponents claim the popularizing the scholarly work, and making it more relevant to current issues faced in public administration would enhance the transfer of knowledge from scholars to street level bureaucrats and public managers. However, some argue this approach falls short of expectations because many practitioners of public administration have little influence on the content of knowledge offered by scholars. Collaboration- This strategy aims to enhance communication between scholars and practitioners before the theory is developed in order to build a dialectic method of inquiry, building on the idea that communication is necessary throughout the whole theory building process in order to have a well development practical theory. Scholars Van de Ven and P.E. Johnson put it as: \\"Engagement is relationship that involves negotiation and collaboration between researchers and practitioners in a learning community; such a community jointly produces knowledge that can both advance the scientific enterprise and enlighten a community of practitioners.\\"  Important Figures in Public Administration Theory  = Max Weber = Max Weber, one of the many theorists. Max Weber was a German political economist, social scientist, and renowned Philosopher is an important father to the theory of Public Administration and the bureaucratic side of it. He did extensive research studying ancient and modern states to gather a better perspective of bureaucracies in multiple eras for his Magnum Opus Economy and Society published in 1922. That piece of work has contributed countless insight into the Public Administration Theory. Max Weber considered bureaucracy to be the most rational form of administration yet devised by man. In his writings he asserts that domination is exerted through administration and that for legal domination to take place bureaucracy is required. = Woodrow Wilson = Thomas Woodrow Wilson, another one of the theorists of Public Administration. Woodrow Wilson defined public administration as a detailed and systematic execution of public law, he divided government institutions into two separate sectors, administration and politics. According to him politics is dealt with policy formulation and questions regarding such, whereas administration is equipped with carrying said policies out. In his own words in his early essay, \\"The Study of Administration\\" he said \\"it is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one.\\" Wilson very much so tried to establish a distinction between politics and administration; he saw administration as a field of business which lies outside politics. He thought the theory of public administration existed simply because of technicalities and was around for the behind the scenes business aspect of politics. = Frederick Winslow Taylor = Frederick Taylor was an engineer by profession who saw much of life from a scientific aspect. He is a popular less conservative contributor to the Theory of Public Administration in that he produced his own, very popular, theory of traditional public administration, The Scientific Management Theory. He was concerned with finding the best and most efficient way to complete a task for a particular job, reducing the overall labor a worker had to exert with the least amount of movements. Frederick Taylors work approached motivation with a very authoritative, cold, scientific motivator which weighed heavy over any sort of humane aspect to scientific management. Overall many intricacies in Public Administration such as management, control and accounting are subject to scientific principles and Taylor draws on these to find his own, efficient theory approach to Public Administration Theory.  Public Administration Theory in Practice  = Classical Public Administration- United States = Often considered the best way for organizing public sector work, it was used highly in the western world in the 19th and early 20th century. A differing proponent between America and Europe is the transferring of effective management methods between large private and public organizations. The first effective theory in America was Scientific Theory coined by Frederick W. Taylor in 1911. His work \\"Principles and Methods of Scientific Management\\" was used to implement ideas that would increase the efficiency of American government. Taylor's ideas of standardizing work, systematic control, and a hierarchical organization were perfect fits for the public sector of the 1940s.[5] = New Public Management - United Kingdom = New Public Management was the prominent theory that inspired health care reforms for the United Kingdom. Its application to health care coincided with the growing expenditures that were being used due to the progress of technology and an aging population. The difference between private and public sectors in terms of budget process and ideology provided a clash of interest. 1990 saw the National Health Service create an internal market of separate care providers and hospitals. This creation of markets in turn stopped the State from being the funder and service provider simultaneously, to just primarily the funder. Although not privatized, these markets became competitive in nature. Assumption that the competition would lead to more empowerment, efficiency, and equity became rampant. Soon the publicly owned hospitals were granted a quasiautonomous status from the District Health Authorities leading to the competition for patients and funds. Their status acquired led to little if any interference in the everyday operations. = Postmodern Public Administration - United States = Postmodern Public Administration is linked to the capitalist model of the late 20th and 21st century. It relates to globalization, consumerism, and the fragmentation of authority and state. The concepts of science and reason are de-centered and viewed as the defining truths. It tends to negate any faith based actions.[7] See also * Lean Government References *Brownlow, Louis. \\"Woodrow Wilson and Public Administration.\\" Jstor.

It is the third of the Flashman novels. Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the supposedly discovered historical Flashman Papers, this book describes the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to Flashman, who is not only the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, but also a well-known Victorian military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note detailing the discovery of these papers and also discussing the supposed controversy over their authenticity. A reference is made to an article in The New York Times from 29 July 1969, which puts these claims to rest. Fraser hints that the article supports the papers' authenticity, although the opposite is true. Flash for Freedom begins with Flashman considering an attempt at being made a Member of Parliament and continues through his involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, the Underground Railroad, and meeting a future president, detailing his life from 1848 to 1849. It also contains a number of notes by Fraser, in the guise of editor, giving additional historical information on the events described. Plot summary From Dahomey to the slave state of Mississippi, Flashman has cause to regret a game of pontoon with Benjamin Disraeli and Lord George Bentinck. From his ambition for a seat in the House of Commons, he has to settle instead for a role in the West African slave trade, under the command of Captain John Charity Spring, a Latin-spouting madman. Captured by the United States Navy, Flashman has to talk his way out of prison by assuming the first of his many false identities in America. After a visit to Washington, D.C., he escapes from his Navy protectors in New Orleans and hides in a brothel run by an amorous madame, Susie Willinck. He is again taken into custody, this time by members of the Underground Railroad. Travelling up the Mississippi River with a fugitive slave ends badly once again, and the rest of the story has Flashman as a slave driver on a plantation, a potential slave himself, and a slave stealer fleeing from vigilantes; on the run, he meets, and is assisted by, Abraham Lincoln (still a junior congressman at the time) who shows his granite-hard underlying opposition to slavery. Eventually he ends up back in New Orleans at the mercy of Spring. This story is continued in Flashman and the Redskins. At the end of the novel, Flashman claims that his escape with Cassy across the Ohio River was the inspiration for the anti-slavery novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, with the names altered and the story focusing on the slave Cassy rather than Flashman. Characters =Fictional characters= *Harry Flashman - The hero or anti- hero. *John Morrison - Harry's Scottish father-in-law and wealthy mill-owner. An unattractive example of the Victorian capitalist class. The future Lord Paisley repeatedly laments the financial cost of his daughter's marriage while making use of Flashman's relatively high social status and popular fame. In \\"Flash for Freedom\\" he contrives to have his unwanted son-in-law shipped out of England to serve as supercargo on a slave ship. *Captain John Charity Spring M.A. - The formidable and eccentric captain of the Balliol College, a slave ship owned in part by Morrison. He continually utters Latin phrases (conveniently translated by Fraser). Spring reappears in Flashman and the Redskins and finally as a wealthy Cape Colony landowner in Flashman and the Angel of the Lord, where he settles his outstanding grievances against Flashman by having the latter kidnapped. By 1894 Spring is referred to as having \\"long gone to his account\\"; in Flashman and the Tiger. *Lady Caroline Lamb - A slave transported by the Balliol College whom Flashman \\"covers\\" and to whom he teaches some English and (to startle Spring) Latin phrases. Flashman gives her the name of a famous British aristocrat. *Susie Willinck - A New Orleans madame with whom Flashman hides out on his escape from the Naval authorities. *Cassy - A young female slave who helps Flashman escape from his imprisoners in Mississippi. Courageous and passionate she bemuses Flashman by her mixed judgments of his character. *George Randolph - An educated and intelligent quadroon who twice attempts to organize slave risings in the South. The anti-slavery underground railroad movement manipulates Flashman into escorting the fugitive Randolph to freedom in Ohio. The equally conceited and self-centered duo detest each other. Randolph is presumed dead after falling overboard from a Mississippi steamboat, but is reported as having reached Canada alive at the end of the novel. *Peter Omohundro - A slave- catcher who recognises Randolph while Flashman is trying to smuggle him out, leading to Flashman abandoning his charge. He later reappears in Flashman and the Redskins, where he recognises Flashman in a bar and tries to have him arrested, but is killed by Spring. *Tommy Bryant - a fellow officer of Flashman's in Flashman. Bryant settles an outstanding grievance against Flashman by framing him in Flash for Freedom for cheating at pontoon; Flashman responds by attacking Bryant, leading to the former being forced to ship with Spring. *Annette Mandeville - The wife of a Southern slave owner who has an affair with Flashman before framing him for rape when the affair is discovered, causing her husband to sell him as a slave in revenge. She later reappears in Flashman and the Angel of the Lord. *Mr. Mandeville - Annette's husband, who sells Flashman into slavery after she accuses him of rape. *Buck Robinson - A slave-catcher who pursues Flashman and Cassy through Mississippi and shoots Flashman in the buttock before eventually being driven away by Abraham Lincoln while trying to make him give them up. *George Hiscoe and Thomas Little - A pair of slave traders who Flashman is given to by the Mandevilles, charged with delivering him and Cassy to a plantation. Both are killed by Cassy in the course of their escape. *Beauchamp Millward Comber - A British naval officer spying on Spring who dies of injuries sustained while fighting the Amazons after confessing his secret to Flashman, who later impersonates him after the Balliol College is captured. *Mr. Crixus - An operative of the Underground Railroad who press-gangs Flashman into trying to help Randolph escape. =Historical characters= *Benjamin Disraeli - The future Prime Minister, who Flashman calls a \\"cocky little sheeny\\". Although casually insulted by Flashman at Cleeve House, Disraeli is subsequently one of the few persons present to question his guilt as a card-cheat. *Lord George Bentinck *Fanny Locke *William Ewart Gladstone *King Gezo - King of Dahomey. Spring deals with him for slaves. *Dahomey Amazons - The army of King Gezo who butcher a small number of Spring's crew. *Abraham Lincoln - Future President of the United States. Flashman describes him as \\"an unusually tall man, with the ugliest face you ever saw, deep dark eye sockets and a chin like a coffin\\" and says, \\"just why I liked him I couldn't say; I suppose in his way he had the makings of as big a scoundrel as I am myself\\". Background Fraser says the idea for the climactic trial sequence came from his wife. Diabolique magazine argued this would have been a better novel to adapt for the movies than Royal Flash but there has been no film version to date.

Missions included fighter interceptors, electronic research, installation, and support activities, aerial refueling, and bombers. Opened in 1942, the base closed pursuant to BRAC action in 1995 and its airfield is now Griffiss International Airport, owned by Oneida County. In November 1984 the site was added to the National Priorities List because hazardous chemicals were found in soil and ground water. Solvents, lead and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) had been disposed in landfills and dry wells Closed in September 1995 by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission decision, it was realigned for civilian and non-combat purposes in 1995, and is now home to the Griffiss Business and Technology Park. Post-closure, two USAF activities remained: the Rome Research Site of the Air Force Research Laboratory, and the Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) as operated by the New York Air National Guard from a small complex of buildings in the Technology Park. Griffiss was the site of the Woodstock 99 Festival in July 1999. Notorious for overpricing, triple-digit heat, aggressive music, and lack of water, it descended into chaos, although no base assets Location, geography Griffiss Air Force Base is located in central New York state at Rome, in the Mohawk Valley among the Mohawk River, Six Mile Creek, and the New York State Barge Canal. History On 3 April 1941, the War Department began looking for an area to construct an air depot in central New York. Orders to begin construction came from the War Department on 23 June 1941 and ground was broken on 2 August 1941. Facilities were completed in February 1942, and flight operations on the depot airfield began on 18 February 1942. Construction had been supervised by Kenneth Nichols of the United States Army Corps of Engineers Syracuse Engineer District, which was headed by James C. Marshall. Marshall and then Nichols became District Engineer for the Manhattan Engineer District (MED) which built the atomic bomb. After a series of names and realignments, the base was finally named \\"Griffiss Air Force Base\\" in 1948 to honor of Lt. Col. Townsend Griffiss (1900‚Äì1942), a Buffalo native and 1922 West Point graduate. In 1942, Griffiss became the first U.S. airman to be killed in the line of duty in the European Theatre of World War II when the B-24 Liberator bomber he was aboard was shot down by friendly fire over the English Channel. The USAF had originally applied \\"Griffiss Air Force Base\\" to Fort Worth Army Airfield in Texas on 1 January 1948, but its name was changed on 27 February to memorialize native son and Medal of Honor recipient, Major Horace Carswell, who gave his life while attempting to crash land his crippled B-24 over China. =Rome Air Depot= On 1 February 1942, the Rome Air Depot was activated and throughout World War II the depot provided aircraft engine maintenance and repair, and trained air depot groups in engine repair. With the end of the war and the sharp reduction of AAF aircraft operations, activities were sharply curtailed in the fall of 1945. The Rome Air Depot continued operations well into the 1960s as an Air Force Logistics Command Air Materiel Area (AMA) supporting USAF electronics and RADAR systems. The depot began a phasedown in the early 1960s, with the depot closing in 1967 with its functions being transferred to other AFLC Air Materiel Areas. =Air Defense= 100px 49th FIS Convair F-106A Delta Dart, AF Ser. No. 59-0076, in Bicentennial markings, 1976 Although many aircraft landed at Griffiss during the war, the airfield had no permanently stationed flying units. It wasn't until after World War II, that the Air Force Reserve 65th Reconnaissance Group conducted aerial photo and mapping operations from Griffiss from 27 December 1946 until being inactivated on 27 June 1949. On 3 October 1950 the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Group of Air Defense Command (ADC) became the first permanently assigned USAF flying unit at Griffiss. Although the group moved to California in 1951, its 27th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron (FIS) remained behind. ADC units were stationed there for the next 30 years as Griffiss became a center for the Northeast air defense mission, and was headquarters of the Northeast Air Defense Sector. The 27th FIS flew Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars, North American F-86 Sabres, Northrop F-89 Scorpion, Lockheed F-94 Starfires and Convair F-102 Delta Daggers before leaving Griffiss in 1959. 27th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94C Starfire, AF Ser.

ADC activated the 4727th Air Defense Group as a headquarters for the two squadrons in February 1957 and it became a major tenant at Griffiss. The 49th FIS moved, less personnel, equipment, and aircraft from Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts and replaced the 465th FIS in October 1959, receiving, after the transfer, its McDonnell F-101 Voodoos.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 213-214 Later that year, when the 27th FIS departed Griffiss, the 4727th was discontinued. =Rome Laboratory= Electronic research began at the Rome Air Depot in 1949. The Watson Laboratory complex was transferred to Rome from Red Bank, New Jersey between 1950 and 1951. The Rome Air Development Center was begun at the base on 12 June 1951, as a response to the specific electronics needs of air forces learned by the U.S. Army Signal Corps during the war. The RADC would be renamed to Rome Laboratory in 1991 as a response to its changing role in research and development. =Strategic Air Command= Master plan for Griffiss 100px The 416th Bombardment Wing (416 BW), a Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-52G Stratofortress and KC-135R Stratotanker wing that conducted strategic bombardment readiness, conventional bombardment operations, and air refueling operations on a global scale, was based at Griffiss AFB. 416 BW crews and aircraft deployed to the Pacific during the Vietnam War era to support SAC operations during the conflict. In 1991, wing crews and aircraft participated in Operation Desert Storm, the first Gulf War in Southwest Asia. On 1 June 1992, as part of an Air Force-wide reorganization and concurrent with the disestablishment of SAC, the 416 BW's KC-135 aircraft were transferred to the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC). The 416th retained its B-52 aircraft and the wing was transferred to the newly established Air Combat Command (ACC), with Griffiss designated as an ACC base. The 416 BW was inactivated in 1995 as part of another post-Cold War drawdown of United States strategic forces pursuant to a 1993 BRAC decision. Closure of Griffiss AFB was part of this same BRAC action. Among the tenant activities at Griffiss AFB, the base was also home to the aviation brigade of the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division from 1988 to 1992. =BRAC Realignment= Griffiss AFB was selected for realignment by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission in 1993. The facility is now home to the Griffiss Business and Technology Park, and it is still home to the Rome Research Site of the Air Force Research Lab as well as the Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) of North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome Location. At its peak, the base was the largest employer in Oneida County, New York. Griffiss was the site of the Woodstock 1999 Environmental contamination The base was designated a superfund site in 1984.Griffiss Air Force Base Region 2 Superfund, 6 May 2015, US EPA, retrieved 21 September 2015 Solvents, lead and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) had been disposed in landfills and dry wells. This contaminated Three Mile Creek and Sixmile Creek, and ground water beneath portions of the base, and led to accumulation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Leaking underground storage tanks and soil contamination were dug out. People affected by contaminated well water received bottled water until, in 1991, everyone was connected to the municipal water supply. By 2013, 27 of the 31 \\"areas of concern\\" identified in 1995 had been cleaned up or addressed otherwise, and did not need \\"further action\\" per EPA. Redevelopment The base closure on 30 September 1995, meant that 5,000 jobs or 30 percent of the city's economic base were lost. The population decreased by 10,000, from 44,350 in 1990 to 34,950 in 2000. The Air Force Research Laboratory had not been closed, and became core of the redevelopment plan, of making it part of a corporate business and to build a technology park around it. In 2004, a new $24 million facility opened.

It is responsible for much of the compressive resistance and load bearing qualities of the knee joint and, without it, walking is painful to impossible. Osteoarthritis is a common condition of cartilage failure that can lead to limited range of motion, bone damage and invariably, pain. Due to a combination of acute stress and chronic fatigue, osteoarthritis directly manifests itself in a wearing away of the articular surface and, in extreme cases, bone can be exposed in the joint. Some additional examples of cartilage failure mechanisms include cellular matrix linkage rupture, chondrocyte protein synthesis inhibition, and chondrocyte apoptosis. There are several different repair options available for cartilage damage or failure. \\"Maci\\" or autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane, is a treatment to correct cartilage defects in the knee. This treatment has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2016 for adult treatment only.  Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis, which is also known as AMIC, is a biological treatment option for articular cartilage damage bone marrow stimulating technique in combination with a collagen membrane. It is based on the microfracture surgery with the application of a bi-layer collagen I/III membrane. The AMIC technique was developed to improve some of the shortfalls of microfracture surgery such as variable repair cartilage volume and functional deterioration over time. The collagen membrane protects and stabilizes the MSCs released through microfracture and enhances their chondrogenic differentiation. The AMIC surgery is a single-step procedure. Once cartilage damage is assessed there are two methods to access the joint to proceed with the AMIC surgery. First is to perform a mini arthrotomy. Second is an all-arthroscopic procedure.  Autologous chondrocyte implantation The human body's own cartilage is still the best material for lining knee joints. This drives efforts to develop ways of using a person's own cells to grow, or re-grow cartilage tissue to replace missing or damaged cartilage. One cell- based replacement technique is called autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT). A review evaluating autologous chondrocyte implantation was published in 2010. The conclusions are that it is an effective treatment for full thickness chondral defects. The evidence does not suggest ACI is superior to other treatments. One ACI treatment, called MACI (autologous cultured chondrocytes on a porcine collagen matrix), is indicated for healthy patients 18-55 with medium to large sized damage to their cartilage. It is not applicable to osteoarthritis patients. The patient‚Äôs chondrocytes are removed arthroscopically from a non load- bearing area from either the intercondylar notch or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral condyles. 10,000 cells are harvested and grown in vitro for approximately six weeks until the population reaches 10-12 million cells. Then these cells are seeded onto a film that is implanted into the area of cartilage damage and absorbed back into the tissue into the patient. The implanted chondrocytes then divide and integrate with surrounding tissue and potentially generate hyaline-like cartilage. Another ACI technique, using \\"chondospheres\\", uses only chondrocytes and no matrix material. The cells grow in self-organized spheroid matrices which are implanted via injected fluid or inserted tissue matrix.  Autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplantation  Because mesenchymal stem cells may regenerate cartilage, cartilage growth in human knees using autologous cultured mesenchymal stem cells is under research and preliminary clinical use, and appears to be safe as of 2016. An advantage to this approach is that a person's own stem cells are used, avoiding tissue rejection by the immune system. Stem cells enable surgeons to grow replacement cartilage, which gives the new tissue greater growth potential. While there are few long-term studies as of 2018, a history of knee problems and body weight are factors for how well the procedure will work. Microdrilling augmented with peripheral blood stem cells A 2011 study reported histologically confirmed hyaline cartilage regrowth in the knee. The successful protocol involved arthroscopic microdrilling/ microfracture surgery followed by postoperative injections of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) and hyaluronic acid. The procedure creates a blood clot scaffold on which injected PBPCs can be recruited and enhance chondrogenesis at the site of the contained lesion.

Segment format The segments opened with an image of a revolving globe and the title \\"The World of Commander McBragg.\\" The Commander, a retired British naval officer, would buttonhole a hapless member of his gentleman's club, and relate some story filled with unlikelihoods and outright impossibilities (as his name, Commander McBragg, would suggest), always concluding with a hairbreadth escape. For example, McBragg would point to a map on the wall (or globe) and say: \\"There! Zanzibar! Did I ever tell you about the time I ...?\\" His colleague would, despite his initial reluctance (\\"NO, Commander, but I-\\"), become engaged in the exciting tale (\\"Good Heavens, Commander! What did you do?\\"), and at the conclusion would compliment the Commander on his cleverness‚Äîusually incorporating a terrible pun‚Äîto which the Commander would usually respond, \\"Quite.\\" Character origins The deep, gravelly voice of Commander McBragg was provided by veteran voice talent Kenny Delmar, best known for his stammering non-stop talking as \\"Senator Claghorn\\" (of which Foghorn Leghorn, the Looney Tunes character, is a parody) on The Fred Allen Show. The character of McBragg is a classic example of the miles gloriosus, a stock character known for his military experience and dubious claims of grandeur; the tradition dates back to ancient Rome. English actor C. Aubrey Smith ‚Äì from the 1939 motion pictures The Four Feathers (\\"War was war then\\") and Another Thin Man ‚Äì often played roles in films similar to the exploits related by McBragg and has been cited as an influence. The stories, more often than not, were taken from or were imitations of the Baron Munchausen stories of Rudolf Erich Raspe. The Englishness of the commander, the reluctance of his audience to listen to his far-fetched stories, and the commander's insistence on telling them, suggest the influence of P.G. Wodehouse's \\"Oldest Member\\" golf stories as well. Arthur Conan Doyle also indulged the tradition with his stories of Brigadier Gerard. Other influences include the early animated character Colonel Heeza Liar, [He's a Liar] the subject of a number of animated shorts created by John R. Bray and directed by Walter Lantz, who was later known for the Woody Woodpecker franchise. Another influence may have been Captain Geoffrey Spicer-Simson DSO, RN, a career Royal Navy officer noted for telling of his improbable exploits whose career as a surveyor took him to China, Borneo and Africa. Spicer-Simson's greatest claim to fame was winning the Battle of Lake Tanganyika during World War I with two armed motor launches named Mimi and Toutou.

It was originally made by Rowntree's of York, England, hence the name.  History  In 1976, Eric Nicoli of Rowntree's spotted a gap in the confectionery market and used the cocoa from Rowntree's favourable futures market position to launch Yorkie. Production was at York and Norwich (until 1994). The Yorkie bar, a chunkier alternative to Cadbury's Dairy Milk, was aimed at men. In the 1980s for example, toy lorries with the Yorkie bar logo were manufactured by Corgi, and television advertisements for the Yorkie bar featured lorry drivers. In 2001, the advertisement campaign made this more explicit with the slogan and wrapper tagline It's not for girls!, which caused controversy due to its sexism. Special versions for use in Ministry of Defence ration packs read It's not for civvies. In 2006 a special edition that was for girls was sold, wrapped in pink. Aside from the original milk chocolate bar, several variants are available, such as \\"raisin and biscuit\\" flavour, \\"honeycomb\\" flavour, and Yorkie Ice Cream. In 2011, standard Yorkie bars became available in 3 packs and the 'It's Not for Girls!' slogan was dropped around that time; however, it is still occasionally used. One notable advert for the chocolate bar showed trains arriving at York railway station and passing a billboard which read \\"Welcome to\\" followed by a picture of a Yorkie bar, with the end bitten off. Thus the advert appeared to read, \\"Welcome to York\\". Beneath was the slogan, \\"Where the men are hunky and the chocolate's chunky\\". = Size changes = Yorkie bars were originally composed of six chunks of chocolate each marked Rowntree; they were wrapped in both foil and an outer paper wrapper and weighed . The wrapping was later switched to a single plastic foil wrapper. More recently, in an effort to reduce costs, the number of chunks has been reduced to five with \\"Yorkie\\" moulded into each chunk. The weight of the bar has decreased over the years. In 2002, Yorkie bars were . This had been reduced to by 2010, and was reduced further to in 2011 and then later that year.

He is the current men's soccer coach at the University of Memphis. Career =College= Mulrooney played four years of college soccer at Creighton University, where he recorded 51 assists from 1995 to 1998. While there, he helped lead the team to the NCAA Final Four in 1996, and was named an NCAA All-American as a senior. =Professional= Upon graduating, Mulrooney was drafted third overall in the 1999 MLS College Draft by the San Jose Clash. Mulrooney immediately earned himself a place in the Clash's starting lineup, starting 25 games while scoring one goal and 3 assists as a rookie. Mulrooney has since established himself as one of the most important players on the team, playing in 163 games and adding 44 assists while orchestrating the team's offense (both numbers are club records). He left the Quakes before the 2005 season, traded to Dallas in a large deal that included Arturo Alvarez and Brad Davis. Mulrooney helped form the core of the FC Dallas squad that began the 2005 season in first place, but Mulrooney tore his ACL May 14, 2005 and missed the remainder of the season. He came back to become a regular for Dallas in 2006 and was named as a commissioner's pick to the 2006 MLS All-Star game, starting as the MLS All-Stars beat Chelsea 1‚Äì0. On March 20, 2007, Mulrooney was traded to expansion MLS club Toronto FC, in exchange for a partial allocation and a 2008 SuperDraft first-round pick. On April 18, after only two games with TFC, he was sent to the Houston Dynamo for Kevin Goldthwaite and a 2008 first-round pick. Mulrooney played every game the remainder of the season for the Dynamo and tied for the team lead with five assists. He also set up Nate Jaqua for the first goal in the Western Conference final against Kansas City. The Dynamo's 2007 MLS Cup championship was Mulrooney's third league championship. After the 2010 MLS season Houston declined Mulrooney's contract option and he elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Mulrooney became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft. =International= Despite his success in MLS, Mulrooney has struggled to earn time for the US national team, as Claudio Reyna, John O'Brien, Pablo Mastroeni and Chris Armas play his position. Mulrooney earned his first cap on December 9, 2001 as a substitute against South Korea. During qualifying for the 2002 World Cup in Korea/Japan, Mulrooney featured prominently for Bruce Arena's squad. In a friendly match versus Ireland in Dublin during the lead-up to the tournament there was a torrential downpour which severely hampered play. Since then, he has played a total of 14 games, but has not played a major role with the team. =Coaching= In 2012 Mulrooney joined the University of Memphis soccer staff, Mulrooney is the Assistant coach under HC Richie Grant On February 25, 2014, Mulrooney was named the new head coach at the University of Memphis.

It is the fourth of the Flashman novels. Playboy magazine serialised Flashman at the Charge in 1973 in their April, May and June issues. The serialisation is unabridged, including most of the notes and appendixes and features a few illustrations, collages from various paintings and pictures to depict a period montage of the Charge and Crimea. While George MacDonald Fraser claimed he never had a favourite among the Flashman novels he said his agent, George Greenfield, thought this was the best. Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the supposedly discovered historical Flashman Papers, this book describes the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to Flashman, who is not only the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, but also a well-known Victorian military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note detailing the discovery of these papers. Flashman at the Charge begins with Flashman trying to avoid a transfer to the Crimea but failing miserably. He is made guardian of one of Queen Victoria's cousins and is sent to the midst of the Crimean War. Flashman witnesses and participates in the most notable offensive and defensive actions of that war, and eventually finds himself trekking across Asia in an effort to save the British Raj. Flashman at the Charge covers the years 1854 to 1855. It also contains a number of notes by Fraser, in the guise of editor, giving additional historical information on the events described. Plot summary Flashman meets Queen Victoria's cousin, William of Celle, incognito in a billiards hall and, without knowing his true identity, befriends him, before getting him drunk and leaving him in an alley with Shoe polish covering his buttocks for the police to find. However, his reputation as a valiant and down-to-earth soldier leads to Prince Albert assigning Flashman as the boy's mentor. Despite every attempt to avoid it, he finds himself in the Crimea showing William what soldiering is all about. The boy's unfortunate death does not allow Flashman to avoid involvement in the most notable actions of the Crimean War, including The Thin Red Line, the Charge of the Heavy Brigade under James Yorke Scarlett, and the Charge of the Light Brigade. Powered by fear and flatulence, he reaches the Russian guns in front of the other surviving members of the charge and promptly surrenders. He is taken into Russia (now Ukraine) and placed in the custody of Count Pencherjevsky. Here he reunites with Scud East, his old schoolmate, and meets Nicholas Pavlovich Ignatiev, a vicious Russian Captain. Flashman and East overhear plans by senior Russian officers to invade India and conquer the British Raj. The two men escape from the Count's estate (thanks to a peasant uprising), but Flashman is recaptured by the Russians. Ignatiev takes Flashman with him across central Asia as part of his plans to conquer India. Flashman is rescued from prison by cohorts of Yakub Beg, led by his Chinese paramour. Then the Tajik and Uzbek warriors attack the Russian fleet using Congreve rockets captured from the Russians, which only Flashman knows how to use. Prior to the battle, Flashman was unknowingly drugged with hashish and is utterly fearless as a result, for the only time in his life. The Russian ships are destroyed and Flashman then travels on to British India.

Located between Colegiales, Palermo, Villa Crespo, La Paternal and Villa Ort√∫zar, this is a quiet neighbourhood with tree-lined streets, a combination of vintage rowhouses and apartment buildings. Locally, it's probably best known for the 95 hectare (234.75 acre) Chacarita Cemetery. History Entrance to Chacarita Cemetery Avenida Federico Lacroze The territories of this district belonged formerly to the Jesuits, who had small farms. Its name comes from the word \\"small farm\\" or ch√°cara in old Spanish. Following the Suppression of the Jesuits in 1767, they were expelled and all their goods were declared property of the Crown. One of the few and most important remaining residences from the era is that of the Comastri family, which at the moment is the Escuela Nacional de Educaci√≥n T√©cnica N¬∞ 34. The area's principal park is Los Andes, which was inaugurated in 1941. Chacarita is the namesake for both the Chacarita Cemetery and the Chacarita Juniors football club. The meeting place of the neighbourhood is the ‚ÄúClub Chacarita Juniors‚Äù.

Nicknamed the \\"Jolly Greene Giant\\" due to his height and deep voice, Greene was a long time member of the Grand Ole Opry. A three-time Grammy Award nominee, Greene is best known for his 1966 hit, \\"There Goes My Everything\\". The song dominated the country music charts for nearly two months in 1967 and earned Greene \\"Male Vocalist of the Year\\", \\"Single of the Year\\", \\"Album of the Year\\" and \\"Song of the Year\\" honors from the Country Music Association. Greene had a total of five 1 country hits and three others that reached the top ten. Billboard magazine named Greene one of the Top 100 \\"Most Played Artists\\". Early life Greene was born in Maryville, Tennessee, and learned to play guitar when he was ten years old. His first involvement with the music industry came when he was still a teenager, working as a disc jockey at radio station WGAP in Maryville. By the age of 18, Greene was a regular on the Tennessee Barn Dance show on WNOX (Knoxville, Tennessee). In the early 1950s he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he formed his own band, The Peach Tree Boys. Greene was lead vocalist, drummer, and guitarist for the group for eight years. In 1959, he moved back to Tennessee and settled in Nashville and formed another band, The Tennessee Mountain Boys. A major career break came Greene's way in 1961 when his band served as the opening act for Ernest Tubb. Impressed, Tubb asked Greene to become a part of his backing band, the Texas Troubadors in 1962. Career =Success and \\"There Goes My Everything\\"= For the next few years, Jack Greene was a drummer, guitarist, vocalist, and master of ceremonies for the Troubadors' performances. He soon began serving as opening act on a regular basis for Tubb, as well as playing in the band. In 1964, Jack released his first solo record with The Last Letter. The song originally appeared on one of Ernest Tubb's live albums but drew enough attention that Tubb's record label, Decca Records, released it as a single. Another single, \\"Don't You Ever Get Tired (Of Hurting Me)\\", followed in 1965 but failed to make the country music charts, having the bad luck to come out at the same time as Ray Price's version. Tubb encouraged Jack Greene to leave the Texas Troubadors and pursue a solo career. Said Greene in an interview, \\"Ernest told me 'Son I believe it's time to go.' But also said 'If you can't make it you can always come back and be a Troubador'.\\" Greene's first Top 40 hit came in early 1966 with \\"Ever Since My Baby Went Away\\", peaking at No. 37\\\\. Later that year, Decca released what would become his signature song, \\"There Goes My Everything\\". The song reached No. 1 and stayed on top of the country charts for 7 weeks while becoming a crossover hit. His success continued into 1967 with another No. 1 in \\"All The Time\\" (on top for 5 weeks) and a number 2 hit with \\"What Locks The Door\\". In 1967, he received the prestigious awards for Male Vocalist of the Year, Single of the Year, and Album of the Year from the Country Music Association. In all, he recorded nine No. 1 country hits on various charts including five No. 1 Billboard hits. His success continued into 1968 with another No. 1 with \\"You Are My Treasure\\" and the top 5 hit \\"Love Takes Care Of Me\\". In 1969, he had two No. 1 hits with \\"Until My Dreams Come True\\" and \\"Statue of a Fool\\". He completed the year out with the Top 5 \\"Back In The Arms Of Love\\". It was also in 1967 that Jack Greene became a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He became an Opry mainstay, performing there frequently each year until his health failed. =Continued success= In 1970, Greene gained a duet and a touring partner in Jeannie Seely. Together they had three Country hits including \\"Wish I Didn't Have To Miss You\\", which reached No. 2 on the charts and became Greene's last top-ten hit. Jack and Jeannie's stage show became one of the biggest touring acts during the 1970s. Jack continued to have both solo hits and duets with Seely. Among the biggest of these hits during the 1970s included \\"Lord, Is That Me\\" (1970), \\"There's A Lot About A Woman A Man Don't Know\\" (1971), and two more duets with Jeannie with \\"Much Obliged\\" (1972) and \\"What In The World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\\" (1972). Decca became MCA Records in the early 1970s but Greene kept on having chart success with \\"Satisfaction\\" (1973), \\"I Need Somebody Bad\\" (1973), and \\"It's Time To Cross That Bridge\\" (1974). Afterwards, his chart success declined rapidly as another song in 1974 and one song in 1975 were minor hits, and he was dropped by MCA Records in 1976. =Later career= Jack Greene enjoyed a brief comeback with the Frontline Records label in 1980 as the song \\"Yours For The Taking\\" peaked at No. 28 on the Country charts. The song would be Greene's last in the Country Top Forty. He achieved several more minor hits however on Frontline and then on EMH and Step One Records. He continued to tour regularly and appear on the Grand Ole Opry; 2007 marked his 40th anniversary with the Opry. Jack & Jolly Green Giants 2003 Final years and death Greene continued to record sporadically in the 2000s including the duet \\"You Have Won My Heart\\" and \\"Stetson Cowboy\\" with Santana Maria. However, it failed to chart. Greene recorded his final studio album Precious Memories, Treasured Friends in 2010. An album of duets, it featured fellow Country stars like Lorrie Morgan and George Jones. In failing health, Greene retired from performing in 2011. He died on March 14, 2013 from complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 83 in Nashville, Tennessee. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Jack Greene among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

It is the fifth of the Flashman novels. Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the supposedly discovered historical Flashman Papers, this book describes the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to Flashman, who is not only the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, but also a well-known Victorian military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note detailing the discovery of these papers. Fraser also states he has received communications from people either claiming to be a descendant of Flashman or of someone to whom Flashman owed money. Flashman in the Great Game begins with Flashman at Balmoral as a guest of Queen Victoria. Here he meets with Lord Palmerston, who recruits him to go to Jhansi in India and investigate rumours of an upcoming rebellion among the Sepoys. Flashman skulks through India in various disguises, narrowly avoiding death several times and witnessing first-hand the carnage of the Sepoy Mutiny. Flashman in the Great Game covers the years 1856 to 1858. It also contains a number of notes by Fraser, in the guise of editor, giving additional historical information on the events described. Plot summary Flashman not only encounters Lord Palmerston at Balmoral, but also his old nemesis Nicholas Pavlovich Ignatiev. He escapes assassination narrowly and journeys to Jhansi in India, where he meets Rani Lakshmi Bai, the beautiful queen. He listens to her grievances against the British Raj and attempts to seduce her. Whether or not he is successful is unclear, but immediately afterwards Flashman is nearly garroted by Thuggees. In disguise as Makarram Khan, a Hasanzai of the Black Mountain, he takes refuge in the native cavalry at Meerut. Meerut is where the Sepoy Mutiny begins. Flashman survives the Siege of Cawnpore and the Siege of Lucknow but ends up imprisoned in Gwalior after an attempt to deliver Lakshmi into British hands. He is released just in time to witness the death of Lakshmi, but then his appearance after two months in prison leads to his misidentification as a mutineer. After being knocked out during the British attack on the Rani's camp, he awakens to something that makes Hugh Rose later wonder that Flashman did not lose his mind - he is gagged and tied to the muzzle of a cannon, about to be executed with other mutineers. Quick thinking allows him to communicate with gestures his true ethnicity to his British captors. In an uncharacteristically humane act, he orders the Indian mutineers who were going to be blown away alongside him, to be freed saying \\"the way things are hereabouts, one of 'em's probably Lord Canning.\\" In this book Flashman often behaves heroically, though his interior thoughts are often - but not always - those of a coward and a cad. Victoria Cross and Knighthood At the end of the book Flashman receives the Victoria Cross and finds out he is to be knighted, continuing his knack for being rewarded for heroics despite his efforts to avoid doing anything dangerous. However, his attempt to sneak into Jhansi to convince the Rani to surrender is an act of bravery (and he is nearly killed for his efforts). He also took part in some of the most terrifying actions of the mutiny and even took to defending Cawnpore during the siege. Therefore, this is the first time that one could argue, he did in fact deserve the Victoria Cross and his knighthood, not only for the feats of (unintentional) bravery, but for the horrors he was forced to endure and the initiative he showed in trying to complete his mission. At the end of the book he finds out that he is described - in the recently published book Tom Brown's School Days - as a bully and a coward.

Published on September 27, 1968, it is the Canadian bishops' controversial document about Pope Paul VI's July 1968 encyclical on human life and the regulation of birth.Winnipeg Statement (together with opposing editorial commentary) Summary Published two months after Humanae vitae, the Winnipeg Statement was an attempt by the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops to address widespread concern within the church about the prohibition of all forms of artificial contraception, and to counsel its members on how to respond to those who have difficulty accepting the directives. It recognized that \\"a certain number of Catholics\\", in spite of being bound by the encyclical, find it \\"either extremely difficult or even impossible to make their own all elements of this doctrine\\". These With regard to those in that situation, \\"the confessor or counsellor must show sympathetic understanding and reverence for the sincere good faith of those who fail in their effort to accept some point of the encyclical.\\"Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (Sep. 27, 1968). Canadian Bishops' Statement on the Encyclical \\"Humanae vitae\\" (para. 25). Paragraph 26 stated: In its conclusion, the document referred to the moment of the publication of the encyclical as an \\"hour of crisis\\", but added: Reception Although many episcopal conferences published statements regarding Humanae vitae, it is the Canadian bishops' statement which has been the subject of the most controversy, as has been widely interpreted as a loophole whereby Catholics may feel permitted to use birth control. Central to the debate is the role and importance of personal religious freedom of conscience. =Support= Some see the statement as an honest pastoral attempt to maintain unity in the Canadian church. As Bishop Alexander Carter (then President of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops) explained, Supporters contend that the Canadian bishops were merely trying to defend those who had not matured sufficiently in their faith, and that they were simply upholding the established doctrine expressed in Dignitatis humanae, the Vatican II Declaration on Religious Freedom. They argue that it was this document which compelled the bishops \\"to support the need for personal freedom when dealing with the Church's rejection of artificial contraception ... [and to insist] that married couples could only form their consciences in an atmosphere free of coercion.\\"MacDonald, Neil. \\"Freedom and Responsibility\\" Olive Leaf Journal. Retrieved May 2, 2006. Some have claimed that the statement was accepted \\"with satisfaction\\" by Pope Paul VI. Although this allegation is strongly disputed,Pope, Joseph (Sep. 1998). \\"That Winnipeg Statement Again\\". Catholic Insight. it is worth noting that the Holy See has not published an official condemnation of the Winnipeg Statement, per se. =Opposition= The statement was met with immediate and vocal opposition, which found root especially among conservative practicing Catholic anti-abortion activists. The objections of opponents to the statement are perhaps best summarized in the writings of Vincent Foy, who contends, among other things, that the Winnipeg Statement: *is tantamount to blasphemy, has increased dissent in the church, and is an act of disobedience to the Holy See *has fostered support for homosexuality, the ordination of women, the \\"fundamental option\\", and abortion *is a major factor in the crisis of vocations to the priesthood and religious life *has facilitated anti-life and immoral government legislation *has deprived spouses of married love, has pitted spouses against one another, has made faithful Catholic couples feel betrayed and unsupported, and has been the cause of many marital breakups *permits extra-marital sex, and has led to a lowered respect for women *has not only adversely affected married life in Canada but in many other countries *has led to the killing of countless persons through abortifacient pills and devices Foy further alleges that Cardinal Gerald Emmett Carter, one of the authors, partially repudiated the wording of the most controversial paragraph of the statement, writing in a private letter that \\"I am not prepared to defend paragraph 26 totally. In a sense, the phraseology was misleading and could give the impression that the bishops were saying that one was free to dissent at will from the Pope's teaching\\".Foy, Vincent (Dec. 3, 2003). \\"Fifty Reasons Why The Winnipeg Statement Should be Recalled\\". Reiteration in 1969 In view of calls for the Canadian bishops to officially retract the Winnipeg Statement, they issued a year later a statement in which they declared: \\"Nothing could be gained and much lost by an attempt to rephrase what we have said in Winnipeg. We stand squarely behind our position but we feel it is our duty to insist on a proper interpretation of that position.\\" They added: In 1998, the Canadian bishops voted by secret ballot on a resolution to retract the Winnipeg Statement.

Calls for retraction continue, though some see the Canadian bishops' December 1, 1973, document, Statement on the Formation of Conscience, as evidence that they were trying to distance themselves from the Winnipeg Statement. In 2008, the Canadian bishops issued a pastoral letter titled \\"Liberating Potential\\" that was unquestioned as being in full conformity with Humanae vitae, and invited all to \\"discover or rediscover\\" its message. Critics of the Winnipeg Statement saw the new document as counterbalancing what it called the \\"heretical\\" earlier statement.Socon or Bust blog Also in 2008, Canadian bishops unanimously stated that they were opposed to the appointment of the abortion provider and pro-choice advocate Henry Morgentaler to the Order of Canada, directly quoting from the Compendium of Social Doctrine.

The station is owned by EMF Broadcasting and began airing the K-Love contemporary Christian (CCM) format on February 15, 2008. WLVE's Milwaukee offices and studios are located near the Wisconsin State Fair Park. History WFZH went on the air November 22, 2001 with a temporary all-Christmas music format. This format continued until just after Christmas, when they changed to a contemporary Christian format, 105.3, The Fish. Danny Clayton was hired as the first (and only) program director for the radio station, having previously spent his Milwaukee radio career at AC-formatted WKTI. Other original staff members included Milwaukee radio veteran Andi Miller. Other personalities joined including Jon Hemmer (currently WMBI, Chicago) and Rick Hall, host at SOS Radio Networks. WFZH was owned by Salem Communications, the largest Christian and family-themed broadcaster in the United States. The station shared studio space and staff with its sister station, talk-formatted WRRD-AM. For a time, WFZH had a friendly rivalry with its Chicago sister station, WZFS (\\"106.7 The Fish\\"), which included a paintball game between the stations' employees. This rivalry lasted until the Chicago station was sold to Univision Communications in 2005 and WZFS became Spanish AC station WPPN. In February 2008, Salem sold both stations in separate deals. WRRD was purchased by Good Karma Broadcasting, which moved their ESPN Radio all-sports format from 1510 to 540 as WAUK, with the WRRD calls warehoused on 1510, which has ESPN Deportes Radio. WFZH would remain with the CCM format, but its sale to EMF Broadcasting led to a change from local programming to EMF's K-Love national network. This change took effect after Midnight on February 15, 2008, following 2 days of on-air farewells from the \\"Fish\\" staff. On May 30, the call letters changed to WKMZ. On April 29, 2011 WKMZ changed their call letters to WLVE to go with the \\"K-Love\\" branding. The calls, which had been warehoused at the current day WXVA in Winchester, Virginia and had been used for their longest period on the current WMIA-FM in Miami, Florida from 1984 until 2009, were likely given to EMF by former holders Clear Channel Communications as part of one of the many transactions EMF has executed to Clear Channel in return for selling former K-LOVE translator stations to them to relay Clear Channel HD Radio subchannels on analog FM radio in small coverage areas.

History Established in 1926 by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, their first school in Chicago, Leo Catholic High School has educated thousands of boys from Chicago's South Side and suburbs. Athletics Since its founding in 1926, Leo has competed in the Chicago Catholic League. The school also competes in state championship tournaments sponsored by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). These teams have finished in the top four of their respective IHSA state tournament:IHSA record page for Leo HS *basketball: 4th place (1997‚Äì98); State Champions (2003‚Äì04); 2nd place (2015‚Äì16) *track & field: 3rd place (1982‚Äì83, 2000‚Äì01, 2004‚Äì05); 2nd place (1999‚Äì2000, 2003‚Äì04); State Champions (1980‚Äì81, 1994‚Äì95, 1997‚Äì98, 2001‚Äì02, 2002‚Äì03, 2010-11, 2011-12) The school was initially known for its football team, which made 8 appearances in Chicago's Prep Bowl, which pitted the champion of the Catholic League against the winner from the Chicago Public League from 1934 to 1956. The 1941, 42 and 56 teams won Prep Bowl city championships at Soldier Field. Leo High School is also recognized as the 1941 high school football national champion.

Goldstein (January 6, 1939 ‚Äì June 27, 2015) was an American scientist and engineer, working mainly in the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering. He was a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and emeritus Dean of Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His research into the nature of outer-space materials led to the naming of an asteroid after him in 2000, 4989 Joegoldstein. His early research was at MIT, where he received a B.S. in 1960, an S.M. in 1962 and an Sc.D. in 1964. From 1964 to 1983, Goldstein was a professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Lehigh University. During a sabbatical year in 1975, Goldstein discovered that analytical electron microscopy could resolve the solute profiles in synthetic meteoritic materials. He used the technique of AEM to supplement his extensive Scanning Electron Microscopy techniques. He initiated the Lehigh University Summer Microscopy School in 1970 and these continue today, teaching both SEM and AEM microprobe techniques. Goldstein was the lead author, in collaboration with several fellow LUSMS faculty members, of four editions of Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis. The text is used worldwide in electron microscopy seminars and graduate courses. In 1983, Goldstein became Vice President for Graduate Studies and Research at Lehigh. In 1990, Goldstein moved to UMass to become Dean of Engineering, a position he held until 2004. In 1999 he received the Henry Clifton Sorby Award of the International Metallographic Society. The asteroid 4989 Joegoldstein was named after Goldstein in 2000 by Schelte J. Bus, who had discovered the asteroid in 1981 at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. It was named in honor of Goldstein because of his outstanding contributions to the science of meteoritics. In 2005 he received the highest award of the Meteoritical Society, the Leonard Medal, for work on metal, phosphide, carbide, and sulphide in meteorites and lunar rocks; the formation of the Widmanst√§tten pattern and the determination of cooling rates in irons, stony-irons, and chondrites; the nature of plessite and martensite formation; and determinations of phase diagrams for the Fe-Ni, Fe-Ni-P, Fe-Ni-Co, Fe-Ni-C, and Fe-Ni-S systems [2].

S. Fry & Sons in 1847, in Union Street, Bristol, England. The original chocolate bar consists of a plain fondant centre enrobed in plain chocolate. Variants include Peppermint Cream, Orange Cream, Raspberry Cream and Strawberry Cream. History Fry's Chocolate Cream was first produced in 1866 and is considered the direct descendent of Fry's Cream Stick produced in 1853. The Cream Stick was the first industrialised and affordable chocolate bar. In 1875, Fry's Chocolate cream was remoulded to the shape it still has today. During production, it once exceeded half a million units per day and the foil wrapping and label would appear in 1925. The Orange Cream and Peppermint Cream, followed by Fry's Five Centre, were introduced in 1934.

Cadbury also produced a solid milk chocolate bar called Five Boys using the Fry's trademark from 1902 until 1976. Cadbury produced milk and plain chocolate sandwich bars under the Fry's branding also.

The enrollment of 3,400 students includes undergraduates, master's candidates, and PhD candidates. In 2001, the college was named for the Leeds family, spearheaded by alumnus Michael Leeds of New York, who committed $35 million to the school. History Business Field, Outside the Koelbel Building, September 2014 What is today known as the Leeds School of Business began in 1906 as the College of Comm, a division of the College of Liberal Arts. The University of Colorado was one of the leaders in establishing a college of commerce, according to the Biennial Report of 1906-1908. The report noted that the distinction between the College of Commerce and the ordinary business college. \\"The man who is to be a leader in business must know something of law, economics, the markets of the world, and the location of available power and labor.\\" In 1922, the business program became the School of Business Administration and relocated to the basement of Guggenheim, the former law school building. The faculty was enlarged to a total of 15, and the school was on its way to become one of the university's first principal professional schools. The business program was accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the accrediting body of business schools, in 1937. The AACSB recognition is only given to those schools that achieve and maintain established standards of excellence with respect to curriculum, faculty, library resources, and financial support. At this point the business school was still without a real home. Classes were being held in several buildings across campus. In 1960, the school began offering doctoral degrees in business, and by 1965 the success of the program prompted the University of Colorado Board of Regents to establish the Graduate School of Business to administer master's degrees. The school moved to its present location in 1970. In October 2001, the Leeds family of New York made a $35 million commitment to the University of Colorado Boulder's business school, the country's seventh largest endowment to a business school. The school was renamed the Leeds School of Business in recognition of the gift. From 2009- 2011 Manuel Laguna served as interim dean after Dennis Ahlburg accepted the presidency of Trinity University in San Antonio. In January 2011 it was announced that David L. Ikenberry had been appointed dean of the Leeds School of Business. He had previously held the position of Associate Dean at the College of Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He stepped down as Dean in 2016. Sharon Matusik, a Leeds School professor of strategy and entrepreneurship now serves as the Dean. In 2019 the school has: more than 55 tenure track faculty and 28 instructors; more than 3,400 undergraduates; over 200 full-time MBA students and 115 evening MBA students; and over 40 PhD students.

Teresa was a major figure of the Counter-Reformation in 16th-century Spain, and eventually was named a Doctor of the Church, while her work became a classic text in Christian spirituality and mysticism, especially in the realms of prayer in Christianity and Spanish Renaissance literature. Teresa called this a \\"living book\\" and in it set out to teach her nuns how to progress through prayer and Christian meditation. She discusses the rationale for being a Carmelite, and the rest deals with the purpose of and approaches to spiritual life. Overview Teresa of √Åvila The title was inspired by the devotional book The Imitation of Christ, published in 1418, and had become a favourite expression of Teresa much before she wrote this work as it appeared at several places in her autobiography, The Life of Teresa of Jesus. Like her other books, The Way of Perfection was written on the advice of her counsellors to describe her experiences in prayer during the period when the Reformation was spreading through Europe. Herein she describes ways of attaining spiritual perfection through prayer and its four stages, as in meditation, quiet, repose of soul and finally perfect union with God, which she equates with rapture. Over time, the book meant as spiritual instruction for her nuns offered her views on Christian theology and spiritual direction in a more direct and accessible way than her more famous works, like The Interior Castle and her autobiography.Benedictine. p. xxviiFeduccia, p. 123 See also * Catholic beliefs on the power of prayer Notes References  Teresa of Avila: The Way of Perfection * External links * The Way of Perfection, Teresa of Avila, 1964 translation at Christian Classics Ethereal Library Christian mysticism 1577 books Christian devotional literature 16th-century Christian texts Christian prayer Books by Teresa of √Åvila ","title":"Way of Perfection"},{"id":"4984499","text":"Pleurochrysis carterae is a marine species of unicellular coccolithophorid algae that has the ability to calcify subcellularly.

It is the sixth of the Flashman novels. Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the supposedly discovered historical Flashman Papers, this book describes the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to Harry Paget Flashman, who is not only the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, but also a well-known Victorian military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note that while this is the sixth packet of the papers to be published, the story contained within actually takes place chronologically after Flashman, the first packet to be published, and between the two timeframes featured in Royal Flash, the second story to be published. Flashman's Lady begins with Flashman's encounter with Tom Brown, a former acquaintance from Rugby School, and progresses through cricket, battling pirates with James Brooke in Borneo, and enslavement in Madagascar under Queen Ranavalona I, detailing his life from 1842 to 1845. This book is unique among the Flashman series for containing extracts from the diary of his wife, Elspeth. It also contains a number of notes by Fraser, in the guise of editor, giving additional historical information on the events described. Plot summary Flashman meets Tom Brown at a tavern and is convinced to play cricket at Lord's for a team made up of Old Rugbeians. His impressive play (performing possibly the first ever hat-trick) leads to more matches, and an encounter with Daedalus Tighe, a notorious bookie He also meets Don Solomon Haslam, a businessman from the East Indies, who has a lot of money, prestige, and a fascination for Elspeth, Flashman's wife. Due to a wager with Haslam, blackmail from Tighe, and threats from a Duke arising from an affair with the Duke's mistress, Flashman is forced to accompany Haslam, Elspeth, and Morrison (his father-in-law) on a trip to Singapore. Haslam kidnaps Elspeth and flees East; investigations reveal that 'Don Solomon Haslan', old Etonian and prosperous businessman in London and Singapore, is also 'Sulieman Usman', a well-known pirate prince based in Borneo. Flashman must reluctantly chase after them, with the help of James Brooke. This chase takes him to the jungles of Borneo, the nests of pirates, and finally to Madagascar, where he is enslaved and becomes military advisor and lover to Queen Ranavalona I. Escape from the island seems impossible, and with his wife's help he has to overcome his cowardice to evade their minders.

In 2001, marine biologist Silvia Maci√° discovered that squid were able to propel themselves up out of the water about and fly approximately before re-entry; a discovery which led to the identification of six species of flying squid. Distribution and habitat The Caribbean reef squid is found throughout the Caribbean Sea as well as off the coast of Florida, commonly in small schools of four to thirty in the shallows associated with reefs. The habitat of the Reef Squid changes according to the squid's stage of life and size. New hatchlings tend to reside close to the shore in areas from below the surface on or under vegetation. Young small squid typically congregate in shallow turtle grass near islands and remain several centimeters to two meters from the surface to avoid bird predators. Adults venture out into open water and can be found in depths up to 150 m. When mating, adults are found near coral reefs in depths of . The Caribbean reef squid is the only squid species commonly sighted by divers over inshore reefs in the Florida, Bahamas and Caribbean regions. Feeding behavior This species, like most squid, is a voracious eater and typically consumes 30‚Äì60% of its body weight daily. Prey is caught using the club-like end of the long tentacles which are then pulled towards the mouth supported by the shorter arms. Like other cephalopods, it has a strong beak which it uses to cut the prey into parts so that the raspy tongue, or radula, can be used to further process the food. It consumes small fish, other molluscs, and crustaceans. Communication Caribbean reef squid have been shown to communicate using a variety of color, shape, and texture changes. Squid are capable of rapid changes in skin color and pattern through nervous control of chromatophores. In addition to camouflage and appearing larger in the face of a threat, squids use color, patterns, and flashing to communicate with one another in various courtship rituals. Caribbean reef squid can send one message via color patterns to a squid on their right, while they send another message to a squid on their left.The Cephalopod Page: Sepioteuthis sepioidea, Caribbean Reef squid Reproduction Like other cephalopods, the Caribbean reef squid, is semelparous, dying after reproducing. Females lay their eggs then die immediately after. The males, however, can fertilize many females in a short period of time before they die. Females lay the eggs in well-protected areas scattered around the reefs. After competing with 2-5 other males, the largest male approaches the female and gently strokes her with his tentacles. At first she may indicate her alarm by flashing a distinct pattern, but the male soon calms her by blowing water at her and jetting gently away. He returns repeatedly until the female accepts him, however the pair may continue this dance or courting for up to an hour. The male then attaches a sticky packet of sperm to the female's body. As he reaches out with the sperm packet, he displays a pulsating pattern. The female places the packet in her seminal receptacle, finds appropriate places to lay her eggs in small clusters, and then dies.

They are the four angles from which strategy can be viewed and implemented on a corporate level. Overall, strategy is likely to come from a variety of sources and a combination of the above techniques. Johnson and Scholes talk about 'strategic lenses', which are three ways of viewing what can be meant by the term 'strategy' Views The four viewpoints are: as design, as experience, as ideas, as discourse. =Strategy As Design= This lens views Strategy development as a process of logical determinism. Through careful evaluation of the firm's industry, environment and available resources, the optimal strategy and clear direction can be determined. This strategic process thus follows an analysis-selection-implementation process. Fundamental to this view is that the responsibility of strategy development is top-management driven and that they are capable of choosing the optimal strategy for the business. =Strategy As Experience= Many proponents of the view of Strategy As Experience, such as Mintzberg would argue that the design lens is often inaccurate as top level executives are too distant from daily developments of the organisation. According to Minzberg, strategic development should be adaptive, and divides it into intended, realised and emergent strategies. In this model, strategic development is the continuous adaptation of past strategies based on experience. In this view strategy is greatly influenced by taken for granted assumptions (culture) and involves large levels of bargaining and negotiation. Strategy as Experience carries with it a risk of the effect known as strategic drift as a result of failing to act upon environmental changes by being too 'path dependent' on past activity. Remember the 4 lenses are a theory of strategic management. =Strategy As Idea= This approach to strategy emphasis innovation and the need for diversity of ideas in the organisations. Strategy can emerge from the way people within the organisation handle and respond to the changing forces present both in the organisation and in the environment. Support of this view argue partly by analogy with evolutionary theory, suggesting where there is diversity of approach, a change in environment conditions is likely to be accommodated by one of the various methods, products or system already existence. =Strategy As Discourse= This view consists in making choices between different possibilities and then inspiring confidence for the choice taken. This view is very high on legitimacy and low on rationality and innovation. Strategy as discourse sees strategy development in terms of language as a \\"resource\\" for managers by which strategy is communicated, explained and sustained and through which managers gain influence, power and establish their legitimacy as strategists. Johnson and Scholes suggest that viewing strategy through only one of these lenses can mean that problems that the other lenses might show up are missed. For example, too much reliance on incremental changes (strategy as experience) might overlook radical new developments that could be essential for the organisation's success (strategy as ideas). It is worth considering the very strong influence the design and experience lenses have in large organisations and government departments. Often, the larger the organisation, the less able it is to adopt early essential but radical changes.

It is the seventh of the Flashman novels. Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the supposed discovery of a trunkful of papers detailing the long life and career of a Victorian officer, this series centres around Flashman, the bully from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to him, who has grown from the schoolboy of Thomas Hughes's novel into a well-known and much decorated military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note detailing the discovery of these papers. The story proper begins with Flashman fleeing with Susie Willinck (a New Orleans madam, aka \\"Miss Susie\\"), as described at the end of Flash for Freedom!. They cross the continent to join the California Gold Rush, meeting several well-known personalities of the American West in 1849 and 1850. The story resumes in 1875, when he takes part in the Battle of the Little Bighorn the following year. It also contains a number of notes by Fraser, in the guise of editor, giving additional historical information on the events described. Plot summary In his haste to leave New Orleans and the threat of imprisonment, Flashman agrees to shepherd Susie Willinck and her company of prostitutes to Sacramento, where she intends to set up shop and make a bundle from gold miners. As wagon captain, Flashman is nominally in charge of his and Susie's (now his wife) collection of women, supplies, sex toys and the other forty-niners and invalids looking for a better life but he depends on the guidance of Richens Lacey Wootton to see them through. Unfortunately, Wootton becomes stricken with cholera. Flashman is left to get everyone to Bent's Fort in safety, which Comanches make difficult for him. Eventually, they reach Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Flashman absconds with two thousand dollars made from selling one of the prostitutes, Cleonie, to Navajos. For safety in the wilderness, Flashman falls in with a group of travellers but he discovers them to be scalp-hunters, when they attack a band of Apaches. Flashman joins in but refuses to take any scalps or rape captive women, which saves him when the scalp-hunters are killed by the rest of the tribe on their return. He ends up marrying Sonsee- Array, the daughter of chief Mangas Coloradas, and becoming friends with Geronimo. He eventually escapes and is saved by Kit Carson on the Jornada del Muerto. In 1875 Flashman returns to America with his wife, Elspeth. He meets George Armstrong Custer (whom Flashman had met during the US Civil War) and businesswoman Mrs. Arthur B. Candy, and later travels to Bismarck, North Dakota, to meet with Mrs. Candy and pursue a carnal relationship. However Mrs Candy is revealed to be Cleonie, the former slave girl, who is intent on revenge and at her connivance, he is kidnapped by Sioux and kept captive at Greasy Grass. He escapes just in time to see the defeat and death of Custer‚Äîpossibly being the one who kills Custer‚Äîand to be partly scalped himself by his own illegitimate son from Cleonie, Frank Grouard, who by choice has been living as an Indian. The book ends with Flashman and his son travelling to Deadwood where Flashman meets another former acquaintance, Wild Bill Hickok prior to returning home. Characters =Fictional characters= *Harry Paget Flashman - The hero or anti-hero *Elspeth - His loving and possibly unfaithful wife. *Susie B. Willinck - A brothel owner and former prostitute. One of Flashman's \\"wives\\". *Cleonie Grouard/Mrs. Arthur B. Candy - One of Susie Willinck's prostitutes. *Sonsee-Array - Daughter of Apache chief Mangas Colorado and Flashman's \\"wife\\". *Grattan Nugent-Hare - A member of Susie's wagon train, he absconds with two thousand dollars. Flashman later runs into him, discovering that he is one of Gallantin's scalp hunters, and that Susie had an affair with him. Flashman eventually gets into a fight with him over Sonsee-Array, which leads to Flashman accidentally killing him. =Historical characters= *Jim Bridger - Mountain man who confirms Flashman as suitable to be a wagon-captain *Spotted Tail - A Brul√© Lakota who Flashman initially meets in 1849, and then in 1875 at a wedding in Chicago. He may or may not have slept with Elspeth. *John Joel Glanton - Scalphunter who Flashman falls in with. He describes Glanton (who he refers to as Gallantin) as \\"a burly fellow with feathers in his hat and two pistols belted over his frock- coat; when he turned I saw he had a forked beard and a great red birth-mark over half his face - a Sunday school-teacher, devil a doubt.\\" Flashman is deceived into joining a scalp-hunt, an affair that results in his capture by the Apaches. *Mangas Coloradas - Apache chief. Flashman is terrified by his physical appearance, and says, \\"He was a fine psychologist...an astute politician, and a bloody, cruel, treacherous barbarian who'd have been a disgrace to the Stone Age.\\" Flashman eventually finds himself, due to circumstances beyond his control, forced to wed Colorado's daughter. *Geronimo - Referred to in the novel as \\"the Yawner,\\" Geronimo appears as one of Flashman's Apache captors and, later, friends. Though Flashman is open about his loathing for the Apache, he also refers to Geronimo as his \\"closest Indian friend.\\" Flashman also refers to his relationship with Geronimo in the early 1900s, nearly half a century after their time together. *Kit Carson - Carson makes a cameo in which he rescues a terrified Flashman from a group of pursuing Apache braves. Later, Flashman, while sitting with Carson, is mistaken for the legendary frontiersman by a drunken gold miner. *Lucien Maxwell - Maxwell is briefly part of Carson and Flashman's travelling party. *Philip Sheridan *William Tecumseh Sherman *John Pope *George Crook *Crazy Horse - Sioux leader who Flashman meets twice only briefly, first as a child in the company of Spotted Tail, and later during his captivity at Greasy Grass. Flashman describes him as \\"young and wiry, lean-faced and lank-haired and without paint - but with those eyes he didn't need any.\\" *Ulysses S. Grant - President of the United States during the present novel, but Flashman evidently knows him from before. He says, \\"Grant was the same burly, surly bargee I remembered, more like a city storekeeper than the first-rate soldier he'd been and the disillusioned President he was.\\" *William B. Allison - Flashman accompanies him to Fort Robinson and translates in his negotiations with the Sioux for the Black Hills. Flashman calls him \\"a Senator of unusual stupidity and flatulence\\". In an uncharacteristic show of sympathy for the Black Hills Sioux, Flashman suggests that had Allison been less sanctimonious, the entire war could have been avoided. *Alfred Terry *Red Cloud *George Armstrong Custer - American soldier famous for his Last Stand at Greasy Grass. Flashman is acquainted with him from the American Civil War and clearly finds him annoying but also refers to him as a good cavalryman. Flashman refers to Custer as \\"a reckless firebrand who absolutely enjoyed warfare, and would have been better suited to the Age of Chivalry, when he'd have broken the Holy Grail in his hurry to get at it.\\" When, at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Flashman urges Custer to retreat, he is rebuffed‚Äîa decision that clearly resulted in the subsequent massacre of the 7th Cavalry at Last Stand Hill. During the battle, Flashman sees him die as he fires at a Sioux and likely misses - the implication being that Flashman shot him. *Elizabeth Bacon Custer *Thomas Custer *Boston Custer *Marcus Reno *Frederick Benteen *Myles Keogh *James Calhoun *Henry Armstrong Reed *John Gibbon *George Yates *James Butler *Chief Gall *Wild Bill Hickok *Richens Lacey Wootton *Frank Grouard - In Flashman and the Redskins, Grouard is revealed to be Flashman's illegitimate son. MacDonald Fraser takes significant liberty in adapting Grouard's personal history so as to complete the novel's story. For example, Grouard is portrayed as having a Harvard education and having a friendly relationship with Spotted Tail.

During that period, many medals, tokens and jetons with a political message were issued. This article deals with the earliest Geuzen medals or tokens, i.e. from the mid-century to 1577. In the Dutch language a \\"geus\\" ‚Äì plural \\"geuzen\\" ‚Äì is a familiar word for people who revolted in the 16th century against the Spanish king Philip II. It started with the nobility, then the gentry and finally the common folk. Some years later, when war broke out, the title \\"geus\\" or specifically \\"watergeus\\" (meaning marine ‚Äúgeus‚Äù) was given to the rather irregular force of rebels fighting and living in the estuaries of the large rivers and as a distinction sometimes the name \\"bosgeus\\" (\\"geus\\" of the forest) was given to the originals. \\"Geus\\" is derived from the French word for beggar, hence the translation of \\"watergeus\\" into \\"sea beggar\\". The expression \\"sea beggar\\" by extension now is also being applied for a land bound \\"geus\\". Background The Holy Roman Empire was still at war with France when, in 1555, Philip II of Spain succeeded his father, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. After peace was made, Philip II appointed his half-sister Margaret of Parma as viceroy in the Low Countries and departed for Spain. The real power was invested in the three permanent members of the \\"Raad van State\\", the High Council, Cardinal Granvelle, Viglius and Berlaymont (later the three were called the Consult√°; they were permanent members in the sense that for their office they stayed at court, while the non-permanent members mostly executed functions abroad). The high nobility like William of Orange (or William the Silent, ‚Äústadhouder‚Äù, which means Lord lieutenant, of Holland, Zealand and Utrecht) and Lamoral, Count of Egmont, (‚Äústadhouder‚Äù of Flandres) were members of the ‚ÄúRaad van State‚Äù, the High Council, but became discontented by their loss of power, specifically to Granvelle and also because Spanish troops still remained in the Low Countries after the peace with France. Using a French example, they instituted the ‚ÄúLigue‚Äù, a coalition of the high nobility. The activity of the ‚ÄúLigue‚Äù resulted in the departure of Spanish troops in 1564 and shortly thereafter the retirement of Granvelle. Seeing this success, members of the low nobility, who had been impoverished in the previous decades (like the common people in the southern parts of the Low Countries) united themselves in 1565 in the 'Compromis'. Their political program sought relief from the harsh measures against the Reformation. In early April 1566 400 members of the 'Compromis' united in Brussels. On April 5, led by Henry, Count of Brederode, and Ludwig of Nassau, they presented a petition to Margaret, who was alarmed at the appearance of so many men. Berlaymont is reputed to have whispered to her, \\"Ce ne sont que de gueux\\", (\\"They're just beggars\\"). Three days later, 8 April, during a banquet in the palace of the earl of Culemborg, hearing Brederode, the scorning word 'geus' was chosen as a sign of honour for their group, constituting sort of a mocking order of knights. They decided to adopt a costume that incorporated mendicant symbols such as beggars' bowls and flagons. This was less an eccentricity of the low nobility and more a sort of popular tradition in reversing roles, as at carnival time. A dress code with symbols such as beggars' bowls and flagons at the one side and ‚Äì as will be told later ‚Äì a silver or gilt token on a ribbon around the neck showed them as independent and dominant. There may also have been an element of mockery of the church, as mendicant monks also used such implements. In using words like noble and nobility one should not suppose that those folks in general all behaved according to our understanding of this term. Sometimes the lower Flemish nobility of the 16th century might be better characterized by ‚Äúsuccessful criminals‚Äù. When Charles V went for the first time went to Spain in 1517 and did not land on the preselected spot because of stormy weather, the disappointed Flemish nobles of his court behaved so badly - marauding, murdering innocent people, (all according to Alonso de Santa Cruz) - that officials went to great lengths to ensure that king Charles should not be told. In 1572 William de la Marck, Lord of Lumey, also lower Flemish nobility, took Den Briel for William the Silent. Nineteen Gorinchem captured Roman Catholic clergy were brought to him in Den Briel. After torturing and other cruelties they were hanged on his orders, where William of Orange specifically had requested to be lenient toward Roman Catholic clergy. In the 16th century, beggars frequently were not allowed to beg without getting permission from local municipality or lordship. Already, sometimes permission was only granted if they would visibly wear a small tin or copper token, that way recognizable as sort of an official beggar. This could well be the origin for Geuzen medals as will be seen hereafter. Probably the first political Geuzen medal Letters between Granvelle, at that time in Madrid, and his secretary Morillon in Brussels show that Jacques Jonghelinck, master medal maker with a workshop in one of the buildings of the palace complex in Brussels, in the spring of 1566 had made a mould for a small medal. Successively he cast medals in lead, tin, copper, silver or gold (specimens in tin or copper now are unknown; a very few specimens in lead are found, but because lead is inherently soft - so the medal is not \\"stable\\", its eyelet is of questionable authenticity - lacking proof that they are real originals and not later date copies). On June 15 Morillon sent a lead specimen to Granvelle with the sneer that more medals were cast in lead then in the other metals; a medal for poor people \\"affin peult-estre gue les Geutz demeurent en leur qualit√©\\", something like 'perhaps the quality (of the medals) being in line with the standing of the Geuzen'. Most probably such a medal, cast silver and original gilt, is shown in the next picture. Geuzen medal by Jacques Jonghelinck, cast silver, original gilt, 1566 There is no absolute proof that this is the earliest type of Geuzen medal and was produced by Jacques Jonghelinck, the point being that on original paintings and prints it is through lack of details not very well possible to distinguish between this medal and the two to be discussed next. The medal is described in part I of the book by Gerard van Loon ‚ÄúBeschrijving der Nederlandse Historipenningen...‚Äù, 1713‚Äì1731, and now has the collectors reference vL.I 85/84.5. It is qualified as ‚Äúrare to very rare‚Äù. The medal is small, just an inch not counting the eyelet. It shows the bust of Philip II, with ‚Äú1566‚Äù on its cut and the text ‚ÄúEN TOVT FIDELLES AV ROY‚Äù and on the reverse side a beggar's bag or sack, hands and the text, ‚ÄúIVSQVES A PORTER LA BESACE‚Äù. The texts mean something like ‚ÄúIn everything loyal to the king‚Äù and ‚Äúeven condemned to beggars‚Äô level‚Äù. The medal was worn on the breast with a ribbon around the neck . Morillon gives the information that Jonghelinck's neighbouring ‚Äútourneur‚Äù, doubtless a master furniture maker, turned many small wooden bowls that ladies wore hanging from their ears (now original specimens are unknown). Authentic pictures sometimes show the nobility wearing model beggar's bowls and flasks, fastened to the same ribbon. On the reverse side of the medal shown above, some wear is visible due to contact with breast armour. Of this type of medals about half of the known specimens have their eyelet broken off. That is due to fashion in the late 17th and 18th century, when a medal with an eyelet did not show off beautifully in a collector's cabinet (even nowadays museums sometimes buy early medals with an eyelet broken off, unaware of yesterday's fashion and of complete specimens in other collections). Early in the 17th century, when it became clear that the Dutch were going to win their Eighty Years' War, there was a growing demand for Geuzen medals, because now it was safe to be a geus. From that moment Jonghelinck's medal was copied, mostly not cast but in struck silver, mostly slightly bigger to show off better and already sometimes with attached beggar's bowls and flasks. An early political Geuzen medal by an unknown medal maker Morillon writes on July 7, 1566, to Granvelle that he got angry at Jonghelinck ‚Äúbecause he had broken his first Geuzen medal‚Äú (it is likely that Morillon means that Jonghelinck had broken his mould), but he expected that Jonghelinck could reproduce (his mould), even though he made only a very small profit on his first version. It is (yet) unknown who is the medal maker of the cast silver, gilt, Geuzen medal with collectors reference vL.I 85/84.4 and the qualification ‚Äúvery rare‚Äù shown next. Geuzen medal, cast silver, original gilt, 1566, maker unknown The text is nearly identical to the Jonghelinck medal with the exception that ‚Äú1566‚Äù is now put in the text, but note that there are now hollow points inserted between the words. The medal is slightly bigger and ‚Äúfuller‚Äù then the former one. On the reverse there is no beggars bag or sack but two nobles shaking hands. The left noble has a beggars bowl and flask on his hip. Between the feet of the nobles is a monogram, most likely \\"VLG\\", probably meaning 'Vive le Geux', but it could also refer to the medal maker. Maybe this medal is also shaped by Jonghelinck or a befriended or cooperating medal maker; there is reasonable similarity in style and production method and the monogram does not bar the assumption. Dating the medal is more difficult, because '1566' in the text is not decisive (on the former medal ‚Äú1566‚Äú was found on the cut of the neck of Philip II, so being much more decisive). One of the nobles already retains beggars‚Äô bowl and flask, but the other noble does not yet wear a Geuzen medal on a ribbon, which we will find on a Geuzen medal of 1572, to be discussed later. On the other hand, people in 1566 began to revolt extremely, the so-called \\"beeldenstorm\\" or Protestant iconoclasm, starting August 16 in Steenvoorde. The king, Margareta, the Consult√° and the high nobility are furious, recollecting what happened 30 years earlier in M√ºnster, Gen√®ve and Augsburg and 10 years earlier in Scotland, for that reason definitely no concessions. The majority of the lower nobility is also shocked and the 'Compromis' is disbanded, most nobles swear their loyalty to the king again. A medal with a mixed character, King and reverse Geus, is then unthinkable. For those reasons the best guess is that this medal dates from early summer 1566, to be more specific after 7 July and before the end of August. Van der Meer (see references) presents another Geuzen medal, this time in gold, where it is said that this one belonged to Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn. This medal is nearly identical to Jonghelinck's medal, but it has points (not hollow ones) inserted between the words of the text. The authenticity of that medal is not to be discussed, a question mark could only arise around it to be worn by the Count of Hoorne, who was executed on command of the duke of Alba in 1568. Maybe this third medal is also cast by Jonghelinck or a befriended or cooperating medal maker. To give a fair impression of this last medal a picture of an illustration in Van der Meer's article is given. Hoorne's gold medal, illustration in the contribution in \\"de beeldenaar\\" of May/June 1980, page 92, by G. van der Meer The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam possesses a piece of tapisserie. It shows the famous maiden Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer of Haarlem during the siege of that city in 1572-73 (if you visit the website of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, go to \\"collection\\" and search for \\"geuzenpenning\\", the tapisserie will be one of three \\"hits\\"). We see Kenau, assisted by two other armed maidens, wearing a geuzen medal on a ribbon around her neck. Even the effigie of the Spanish king is being suggested. A Geuzen medal for the Protestants from medal maker ‚Äúlittle lobster‚Äù The Half Moon Geuzen Medal (circa 1570) is also called the ‚Äúhalf moon of Boisot‚Äù because the Watergeuzen or Sea Beggars, commanded by Boisot, wore this medal fixed to their hats at the relief of Leiden in 1574.\\"Half Moon Geuzen Medal\\", New Netherland Institute The 'little lobster' emblem between \\"...PIT\\" and \\"DEL...\\", is the privy mark or 'huismerk' of the medal maker. Geuzen medal, cast silver, tooled, about 1570 The text reads \\"LIVER TVRCX DAN PAVS\\" ('Rather Turkish than Papist') and \\"EN DESPIT DE LA MES\\" ('In spite of the Mass'). Wearing half moons was already in practice in and around Antwerp by attendants of ‚Äú‚Äù, open-air sermons, by . Modet popularized the slogan ‚ÄúLiever Turks dan paaps‚Äù (‚ÄúRather Turkish than Papist‚Äù). The phrases are meant to express a solidarity with the Turks who were also fighting the Habsburgs at that time, as well as opposition to the Catholic pope. These medals were also worn by the Sea Beggars at the capture of Den Briel in 1572. Some time later Modet became parson with the Watergeuzen and reintroduced wearing half moons, where in other places they had gone out of fashion. In the Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal in Leiden this medal is shown in a display on city history. There is a little silver ring attached to the eyelet, indicating that it was probably worn on a silver chain at some time. The Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam also possesses a \\"half moon\\". It is dated to 1574, cast in silver and roughly tooled. A token on the \\"tiende penning\\", the 10 percent sales tax, 1572 The Duke of Alba, in his effort to strengthen the power of king Phillips II in the Low Countries, wanted to get rid of the ‚Äúbede‚Äù - the regular plea for money - to the ‚ÄúStaten‚Äù. This could only be done by introducing taxation. So in 1569 he wanted to introduce a one time tax of 1% on property and a few years later a regular tax of 5% on property sales (this type of tax with the same level is still in use in the Netherlands). At the same time Alba wanted a regular sales tax of 10%, i.e. one in ten, as a sort of VAT. The last one was called the ‚Äútiende penning‚Äù and was met with furious opposition, so Alba accepted a deferral of two years for a hefty sum of money. William of Orange, one of the opponents, was seen as a hero and an unknown medal maker cast a silver token as illustrated. This token is discussed because it bears relation to the next Geuzen medal. ‚ÄúTiende penning‚Äù token, cast silver, 1572, maker unknown The relatively unimpressive small token, diameter , shows William of Orange in harness with sword and battle hammer. The text reads \\"P.V.O\\" or \\"Prince of Orange\\" and \\"DAT EDEL BLOET\\", literally 'that noble blood'. On the reverse 9 'penningen' are shown on a coat of arms, text \\"HEFT ONS VOER DEN 10 PENNINCK BEHOT\\" or \\"has guarded us against the 10th penning\\". This silver, cast, token has collectors reference vL.I 157/155.1 and the qualification \\"very rare\\". More frequently this token is found with a greater diameter and not cast but struck. This is because this token was already rare by the 17th century; by growing demand from collectors the token was 'reissued', struck because casting was already more or less obsolete. And as a tribute to the founder of the republic and the deferral of the 'tiende penning' it had to look more impressive. Sometimes collectors are prepared to pay a better price for the ‚Äúreissued‚Äù token then for the original. A political Geuzen medal, 1572, as token 1572 is an extraordinary year in Dutch history, the taxation on the \\"tiende penning\\" is prohibited, and the Sea Beggars take the city of Den Briel for the Prince of Orange. Vlissingen, Veere and Enkhuizen take the side of the Prince. Reason to celebrate these facts and issue forth a medal. One could not foresee the chances in the war turning very bad later that year (Mechelen castigated, Naarden massacred and Haarlem besieged). The medal is struck on a cast silver plate, originally without an eyelet, collectors reference vL.I 148/145 and qualification ‚Äúextremely rare‚Äù (a comparable medal, silver, gilt, with an eyelet and a small ring, equal collectors reference and qualification was on auction at Laurens Schulman b.v. in April 2002). Geuzen medal, struck on a small, cast, silver plate, 1572, maker unknown On the medal, high, is presented a sword with a 'penning' on top between two ears, left a spectacle and flute, right 9 'penningen'. The text reads \\"EN TOVT FIDELLES AV ROY 1572\\". The medal partly struck weakly, the date is difficult to read. Reverse shows two nobles, one with beggars bowl and flask and the other with an oversized Geuzen medal. The text reads ‚ÄúIVSQVES A PORTER LA BESASE‚Äù. Because of the two texts this medal belongs to the category of Geuzen medals (it was also ‚Äúreissued‚Äù in the 17th century, but struck on rolled silver plate). The symbolism \\"ears\\" refers to Alba, who should listen and spectacles is associated with the seize of Den Briel, the last may sound in Dutch as 'bril', i.e. 'spectacles'. Although fighting was already fierce, it still lasted 9 years before Philip II in 1581 was no longer acknowledged as sovereign by the 'PLACCAERT VAN VERLATINGHE'. The 9 plus one 'penningen' relate to the prohibited taxation of the ‚Äútiende penning‚Äù. The purpose of both medals or tokens, dated 1572, is not clear; were they issued just to commemorate or was their aim also or more to be a token you presented to important friends to show that you belonged to the elite that supported the Geuzen or William of Orange. In view of the difficult economic situation, where there was little room for luxury, the use as token is most likely. The \\"eternal edict\\" of 1577 After the ‚ÄúPacification of Gent\\" Don Juan, or John of Austria, came to an agreement with the \\"Staten-Generaal\\" and accepted the \\"Pacification\\". Jacques Jonghelinck, most likely the master medal maker of the first Geuzen medal - where he did not make much profit, according to Morillon - at that moment master of the mint of Antwerp (1572 to 1606), sees profit in the enthusiasm of the elite and produces a silver memorial medal to be cast in great numbers. The reference code is vL.I 243/230 and there is no qualification of rarity. The eternal edict of 1577, silver, cast, by Jonghelinck Almost all medals are found as shown with a border of \\"vuurslagen\\" (flint strikers) and an eyelet, or a spot where the eyelet is broken off. The purpose was to show the medal as adornment. Jonghelinck tried to maximise his profit by minimising on silver in the casting process, many medals showing small holes due to very thin casting. The production in great numbers and the size of the medal demonstrate that now the economy had started to boost. Geuzen medals with attachments as beggars' bowls and flasks About 1600 it became clear that the northern part of the Low Countries was going to win the war against Spain. As expected, the number of Geuzen medals multiplied. Since prosperity had also increased, Geuzen medals were very much in demand. The very few issues of 1566 to 1572 are manifold copied by striking or engraving on rolled silver plate and not by casting. Also new types were developed and struck. Early in the 17th century it became fashionable to attach small beggars' bowls and flasks to the medal. About 1700 Jonghelincks' Geuzen medal became the most frequently struck, but now with one beggars' bowl and two flasks attached. That is also the kind of execution of today's Geuzen medal as an award for exceptional merits.

The Allentown Band, 1880. The Allentown Band, 1886. The Allentown Band, 1887. The Allentown Band, 1889. The Allentown Band is a civilian concert band based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is oldest civilian concert band in the United States, having been in continuous existence since its first documented performance on July 4, 1828, although its origins may trace back to as early as 1822. The band was known as the Northampton Band until 1838, when the town was officially renamed Allentown. Other names included the Allentown Brass Band (1850-1862) and the Lehigh Cornet Band (1862-1864). Around 1876, the band began using its current name. Conductor Albertus (\\"Bert\\") L. Meyers was a close friend of famed conductor and bandleader John Philip Sousa, who recruited at least twenty members of the Allentown Band for his own organization. The Allentown Band has a long history of performing for visiting dignitaries and dedications. The band has performed for ten United States presidents, including Martin Van Buren during his visit to the area on June 26, 1839, marching in Theodore Roosevelt's inaugural parade in 1901, and performing for Jimmy Carter. In 1861, the band performed at Independence Hall, in a ceremony presided over by Abraham Lincoln. The band performed at both the dedication of Allentown's Soldiers & Sailors Monument in 1899, and its centennial celebration in 1999. The band also performed at the dedication of Allentown's Eighth Street Bridge in 1913, which would later be renamed the Albertus L. Meyers Bridge in 1974 in honor of a former conductor of the Allentown Band. The band typically performs about 45 concerts per year. Many of these performances take place in Allentown's West Park, where an average of 2,500 people attend each concert. West Park has long been home to the Allentown Band. The bandshell, designed by noted Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer (who had also designed the bandshell at Willow Grove Park), was dedicated on September 17, 1908. The Allentown Band performed at the dedication ceremony, playing Rossini's overture to Semiramide. The bandshell was later named the Goldman Bandshell in honor of Edwin Franko Goldman, noted band composer and founder of the Goldman Band. In 1927, Goldman was the first guest conductor of the Allentown Band. He also conducted Allentown High School's band in the 1930s. The Allentown Band was the subject of a segment on the CBS News Sunday Morning television show which aired on July 7, 1991. In 2003, the band was the subject of a WLVT-TV-produced documentary titled, The Allentown Band, 175 Years of Musical Memories. That same year, the book The Band Plays On!: The Allentown Band's 175th Anniversary was published, written by conductor Ronald Demkee. The Allentown Band is part of Allentown's rich musical heritage of civilian concert bands, which also includes the Marine Band of Allentown, the Municipal Band of Allentown and the Pioneer Band of Allentown.

It is the eighth of the Flashman novels. Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the supposedly discovered historical Flashman Papers, this book describes the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to Flashman, who is not only the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, but also a well-known Victorian military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note detailing the discovery of these papers. The present novel takes place shortly after Flashman's service with John Brown in the United States (detailed in Flashman and the Angel of the Lord). There is no explanation as to how he ends up in Hong Kong, but it is from here that he begins his adventures in China. Flashman meets both the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion and members of the Qing Dynasty who participated in the Second Opium War. Plot summary In Hong Kong, Flashman is convinced by Phoebe Carpenter, a lovely minister's wife, to accompany a shipment of opium into Canton, in exchange for a large sum of money and the promise of a later, more pleasant meeting. On the way he discovers that instead of opium he is carrying guns to the Taiping rebels. In Canton, Flashman manages to convince Harry Smith Parkes that he was trying to stop the shipment. However, instead of being able to head for home as he originally intended, he is put on the intelligence staff in Shanghai. From Shanghai he travels to Nanking and meets the leaders of the Taiping rebels, in order to convince them not to march on Shanghai. Flashman then proceeds to the mouth of the Peiho to join Lord Elgin's staff for his march to Peking. After being captured by the Imperials, he meets Xianfeng Emperor and becomes the prisoner and lover of Yehonala, the imperial concubine. When Lord Elgin's army arrives at Peking, he witnesses the destruction of the Imperial Summer Palace. But after that event, while heading for home, he is drugged and apparently kidnapped (perhaps shanghaied, given the dress of his kidnappers) while attempting to fulfil his promise with Phoebe Carpenter. There the story ends, and it is never revealed in any subsequent volume what then became of him immediately afterwards. However, there are several references in other books to his service in the American Civil War, suggesting that he must have returned to that country before 1864, and we know (from Flashman on the March) that he was in Mexico in 1867. Characters =Fictional characters= *Harry Paget Flashman - The hero or anti-hero *Reverend Josiah Carpenter *Mrs Phoebe Carpenter =Historical characters= *James Hope Grant - British general and commander of the British forces during the Second Opium War.

He was also responsible for the destruction of the Summer Palace, which was vilified by many as an uncivilised act of vandalism. Flashman, however, liked him and called him, \\"the shrewdest diplomatic of his day, hard as a hammer and subtle as a Spaniard.\\" Flashman sees the destruction of the Summer Palace as a way of punishing the cruel and decadent court rather than the populace. *John Moyse - the \\"Private of the Buffs\\" who refuses to kow-tow to a local mandarin. Flashman has no such scruples. *Li Xiucheng - Military commander of the Taiping Rebellion, referred to as Loyal Prince Li.

In coordination chemistry, the first coordination sphere refers to the array of molecules and ions (the ligands) directly attached to the central metal atom. The second coordination sphere consists of molecules and ions that attached in various ways to the first coordination sphere. First coordination sphere The first coordination sphere refers to the molecules that are attached directly to the metal. The interactions between the first and second coordination spheres usually involve hydrogen-bonding. For charged complexes, ion pairing is important. ammonia (\\"ammine\\") ligands occupy the first coordination sphere of the ion Co3+.

The second coordination sphere consists of a water of crystallization and sulfate, which interact with the [Fe(H2O)6]2+ centers. Metal ions can be described as consisting of series of two concentric coordination spheres, the first and second. More distant from the second coordination sphere, the solvent molecules behave more like \\"bulk solvent.\\" Simulation of the second coordination sphere is of interest in computational chemistry. The second coordination sphere can consist of ions (especially in charged complexes), molecules (especially those that hydrogen bond to ligands in the first coordination sphere) and portions of a ligand backbone. Compared to the first coordination sphere, the second coordination sphere has a less direct influence on the reactivity and chemical properties of the metal complex. Nonetheless the second coordination sphere is relevant to understanding reactions of the metal complex, including the mechanisms of ligand exchange and catalysis. =Role in catalysis= Mechanisms of metalloproteins often invoke modulation of the second coordination sphere by the protein.

All the proteins of the albumin family are water-soluble, moderately soluble in concentrated salt solutions, and experience heat denaturation. Albumins are commonly found in blood plasma and differ from other blood proteins in that they are not glycosylated. Substances containing albumins are called albuminoids. A number of blood transport proteins are evolutionarily related in the albumin family, including serum albumin, alpha- fetoprotein, vitamin D-binding protein and afamin. This family is only found in vertebrates. Albumins in a less strict sense can mean other proteins that coagulate under certain conditions. See for lactalbumin, ovalbumin and plant \\"2S albumin\\".  Function  Albumins in general are transport proteins that bind to various ligands and carry them around. Human types include: * Human serum albumin is the main protein of human blood plasma. It makes up around 50% of human plasma proteins. It binds water, cations (such as Ca2+, Na+ and K+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin, thyroxine (T4) and pharmaceuticals (including barbiturates). Its main function is to regulate the oncotic pressure of blood. The isoelectric point of albumin is 4.9. * Alpha- fetoprotein (alpha-fetoglobulin) is a fetal plasma protein that binds various cations, fatty acids and bilirubin. * Vitamin D-binding protein binds to vitamin D and its metabolites, as well as to fatty acids. * Not much is known about afamin. It seems to carry lipidated Wnt proteins and Vitamin E around. * Extracellular matrix protein 1 is a less canonical albumin. It regulates bone mineralization. The four canonical human albumins are arranged on chromosome 4 region 4q13.3 in a tandem manner.  Classification  Albumins found in animals can be divided into six subfamilies by phylogeny. The Vitamin-D binding proteins occupy families 1‚Äì3. The other albumins are mixed among each other in families 4‚Äì6. ECM1 is in family 6. In addition to their medical use, serum albumins are valued in biotechnology. Bovine serum albumin is usually used, although versions from humans and genetically-modified rice are also used to reduce animal cruelty. = Other albumin types = A few other proteins are also sometimes called albumins. They are not in the same family as vertebrate albumins: * Ovalbumin is a storage protein in egg white (albumen). It is a serpin. * Lactalbumin, or whey protein, is a protein fraction of milk. It is mainly Beta-lactoglobulin, although serum albumin is a small part of it too. * Some plant seeds, including hemp, encode \\"2S albumins\\". These are named for their egg-like coagulation property.  Structure  The 3D structure of human serum albumin has been determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of . Albumin is a 65‚Äì70 kDa protein. Albumin comprises three homologous domains that assemble to form a heart- shaped protein. Each domain is a product of two subdomains that possess common structural motifs. The principal regions of ligand binding to human serum albumin are located in hydrophobic cavities in subdomains IIA and IIIA, which exhibit similar chemistry. Structurally, the serum albumins are similar, each domain containing five or six internal disulfide bonds. Forensic uses Worldwide, certain traditional Chinese medicines contain wild bear bile, banned under CITES legislation. Dip sticks, similar to common pregnancy tests, have been developed to detect the presence of bear albumin in traditional medicine products, indicating that bear bile had been used in their creation.

He was active in Brussels, working as organist of Church of Saint Catherine and as court organist, and was held in high regard by his contemporaries. A single collection of his works survives to this day, containing numerous short versets and several lengthy works for organ, showcasing Kerckhoven's high contrapuntal skill, and the influence of several important composers, particularly Peeter Cornet. Biography A view of Brussels ca. 1610 The exact date and place of Kerckhoven's birth is unknown. It is likely that he was born around 1618. The Kerckhoven family, which was active in Brussels as early as the late 16th century, included many distinguished artists, singers, and organists; several Kerckhovens served at the royal chapel, and many were organists at local churches. From about 1632 Abraham was working in Brussels as second organist at the Church of Saint Catherine (Sint-Katharinakerk or Sint-Katerijnekerk), and in 1634 he became first organist of the same church, succeeding one Fran√ßois Cornet. Kerckhoven held the position for almost 70 years, until his death in late 1701. He was apparently able to combine it with working as chamber organist for Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria from 1648 to 1656, and as court organist from 1656 to 1684 (and possibly for some time after 1684). When he worked as chamber organist, his salary was small compared to other chamber musicians, and his services were probably not called upon too frequently; however, as court organist he received a much larger salary and was almost definitely first organist. There still exists some small doubt over whether Abraham the court organist and Abraham the organist of Saint Catherine's are the same person. The latter, at any rate, died around Christmas 1701, and was buried on 9 January 1702; the records of the funeral service only refer to him as the church's organist. Kerckhoven married one Joanna \\"Jenno\\" Baert in Brussels, in 1646. They had ten children, and at least three became musicians. Jan (Jan- Baptist, Joannes, or abbrev.: Joes.), the eldest son, worked as court singer and organist in Brussels from 1703 to 1707. He is recorded as singer at Saint Catherine's in 1691 and succeeded his father as organist of the same church in 1702. Finally, Philips (Jan-Philips) is recorded as singer at Saint Catherine's in 1707. Works Most of his works were found in 1905 in a hand- written volume of organ pieces dated 1741 and compiled by Jacobus Ignatius Josephus Cocquiel, organist and priest of Sint-Vincentiuskerk in Soignies. This manuscript is sometimes referred to as the Cocquiel manuscript and is currently in possession of the Biblioth√®que Royale Albert I in Brussels, catalogue number Ms II 3326. Kerckhoven's works were published for the first time in 1933 by J. Watelet as the second volume of the Monumenta musicae Belgicae series; in 1982 a facsimile of the Cocquiel manuscript was published with an introduction by Godelieve Spiessens, and this edition is commonly used now. Kerckhoven's surviving oeuvre consists mostly of organ pieces: fantasies, fugues, preludes, mass settings and other works. His music is influenced by Italian and French styles; fugues and fantasias are reminiscent of Johann Jakob Froberger and quite a few pieces contain typical French registration indications: pieces for plein-jeu, fantasies pour cornet, for cromorne or dessus de tierce. Sectional preludes with alternating free and imitative counterpoint, harmonically rich and expansive, are reminiscent of the northern German organ tradition.

After the success of Freddy vs. Jason and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake film in 2003, New Line Cinema created their House of Horror licensing division which licensed the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise to Avatar Press for use in new comic book stories, the first of which was published in 2005. In 2006, Avatar Press lost the license to DC Comics imprint, WildStorm Productions who has since published several new stories based on the franchise. Marvel Comics In 1989, Marvel Comics released Freddy Krueger's A Nightmare on Elm Street. The black and white comic book was published in a magazine-sized format. The first and only storyline was the two part \\"Dreamstalker\\" written by Steve Gerber with art by Rich Buckler. Other than the inclusion of the characters Amanda and Freddy Krueger and the fictional town of Springwood, Ohio, the story does not fit seamlessly into the continuity of the films and even contradicts the film continuity in several places. The series immediately proved to be Marvel's top selling black and white magazine, even outselling the long running Savage Sword of Conan magazine, but despite distributors soliciting the title through the fifth issue, Marvel quietly canceled the title after only two issues had been released. New stories had been written and submitted by Buzz Dixon and Peter David. Speculation arose that, despite Marvel clearly labeling the book as a mature readers title, Freddy Krueger's A Nightmare on Elm Street could have caused image problems for the publisher who generally catered to younger readers. In 1990, Steve Gerber told Reading For Pleasure that Marvel had canceled the book in anticipation of pressure from various anti-violence advocate groups that were actively protesting violent media in the late 1980s and early 1990s.http://showcase.netins.net/web/chargerhorse/RFP-08.HTM In the October 6, 1989, issue of the Comics Buyer's Guide, Peter David claimed that, while he originally felt that the story he had submitted for the series was like nothing else that he had ever written, in retrospect, he was no longer happy with it and was somewhat glad that it had never been published. Innovation Publishing Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare #3 in 3-D In 1991, Innovation Publishing picked up the A Nightmare on Elm Street license and published three series based on the franchise, before the company filed for bankruptcy in 1992. All three series were written by Andy Mangels.Andy Mangels Home Page The first series was the six issue Nightmares on Elm Street which featured a collection of surviving protagonists from the first five films, including Nancy Thompson, Neil Gordon, and Alice Johnson, uniting to fight Freddy Krueger in his own nightmare world. The first two issues of the series featured Nancy's return as a spirit in the Beautiful Dream, the place Kristen dreamed Nancy into after Nancy's death, and revolved around Freddy killing Nancy's college roommates. The events of the next four issues take place in the time period between the A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare films. The second series, Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, was an adaptation of the film of the same name. The third issue of the series was published in both normal and 3-D formats. The 3-D issue was published in order to recreate the last ten minutes of the film which also used the visual effect. The three issues were also collected and published as a trade paperback. The last series to be published by Innovation was A Nightmare On Elm Street: The Beginning. The three issue mini-series served as a direct sequel to Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, as Maggie Burroughs continues to have nightmares about her father, Freddy Krueger, following the events of the film. Traveling back to Springwood with Tracy, another survivor from the film, Maggie researches Freddy's life leading up to his death at the hands of the Springwood parents. Only the first two issues of the series were released before Innovation's declaration of bankruptcy, leaving the third issue unpublished and the story incomplete. Mangels made the original script for issue number three available on his website for a time. Trident Comics In 1992, Trident Comics released four magazine-sized issues of Freddy's Nightmares, exclusively in the United Kingdom. The series contained no original material, instead opting to reprint Innovation's Freddy's Dead adaptation, the first two issues of Innovation's Nightmares On Elm Street and the first issue of Marvel's Freddy Krueger's: A Nightmare on Elm Street. Despite the title of the series, it has no direct connection, other than the depiction of the Freddy Krueger character, to the Freddy's Nightmares television series which aired in 1988. Avatar Press In May 2005, Freddy Krueger returned to comic books, for the first time in thirteen years, with the A Nightmare On Elm Street Special written by former Chaos Comics founder, Brian Pulido and published by Avatar Press in association with New Line Cinema's House of Horror licensing division. Events from the A Nightmare On Elm Street Special would carry over into the A Nightmare On Elm Street: Paranoid three issue mini-series, published later that same year. Due to Avatar's erratic publishing schedule, the second and third issues of the series were not released until summer, 2006. The mini-series was followed by a stand-alone issue titled Fearbook before Avatar lost the House of Horror license. WildStorm Productions The cover to Wildstorm's A Nightmare on Elm Street #1.In 2006, WildStorm Productions, a publishing imprint of DC Comics, acquired the \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" license and, in October of the same year, began publication of a new ongoing comic book series written by veteran comic book writer, Chuck Dixon with artwork by Kevin J. West, Bob Almond and Joel Gomez and covers by Tony Harris of Ex Machina fame. The first story arc, \\"Freddy's War\\", centered on a teenager named Jade, who moves to Springwood and learns about Freddy Krueger. Along with her father, a former army ranger, and a young comatose girl, Jade confronts Freddy. After the \\"Freddy's War\\" arc's completion, a story about Freddy employing a teenager to kill the girl who helped Jade and her father was released. The second story arc, titled \\"Demon of Sleep\\", detailed a group of social outcasts who, after realizing they are being killed off one by one, decide to summon an Aztec sleep demon to battle Freddy. The last issue, released in June 2007, was about a worker at a fast- food restaurant who was dreaming about Freddy killing other people, until Freddy killed him. In 2007, Wildstorm announced its plan to cancel their ongoing New Line horror comics in favor of publishing mini-series and specials based on the movie franchises. The ongoing A Nightmare on Elm Street series would come to an end after an eight issue run and be replaced by a mini- series, late in 2007.WILDSTORM UPDATES PUBLISHING PLANS FOR HORROR/MOVIE TITLES, DC NEWS , March 13, 2007, Newsarama In September, Wildstorm released New Line Cinema's Tales of Horrors, a one-shot issue featuring separate stories concerning Freddy Krueger and Leatherface. The Freddy Krueger story was written by Christos Gage and Peter Milligan and involves Freddy dealing with an inhabitant of Springwood who has taken to copying his murder style, in a story aptly titled \\"Copycat\\". Freddy next appeared in the six-issue Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, an intercompany crossover with Dynamite Entertainment. The story serves as a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason and The Evil Dead trilogy, based on the original Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash film treatment by Jeff Katz. The comic book series was written by James Kuhoric and illustrated by Jason Craig. A six-issue sequel titled Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors followed in 2009 and featured a large cast of supporting characters from both the A Nightmare of Elm Street and Friday the 13th film franchises.

It is the tenth of the Flashman novels. Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the supposedly discovered historical Flashman Papers, this book describes the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to Flashman, who is not only the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, but also a well-known Victorian military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note detailing the discovery of these papers. The present novel takes place immediately after Flashman in the Great Game and before Flashman and the Dragon. It details Flashman's involvement with John Brown and his raid on Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, from 1858 to 1859. Plot summary At the start of the novel, Flashman leaves Calcutta before the wrath of a cuckolded husband can find him. He proceeds to South Africa, where by a chance meeting he reunites with John Charity Spring (whom he had worked for as a slaver in Flash for Freedom! and seen shanghaied in Flashman and the Redskins). Spring uses his daughter, Miranda, and her feminine wiles to have Flashman drugged and sent to the United States, where charges against his old aliases still exist. Flashman manages to avoid the authorities, but Crixus (one of the chiefs of the Underground Railroad from Flash for Freedom!) finds him and tries to convince him to join John Brown's attempt to start a slave rebellion. One of Crixus' followers, a black man named Joe Simmons, actually works for the Kuklos, a possible forerunner of the Ku Klux Klan. They also want Flashman to help Brown, but in order to start a civil war. One last double-cross exists: the wife of the leader of the Kuklos works for Allan Pinkerton, who brings Flashman to meet William H. Seward. Seward, considered by many at that time to be the next President of the United States, also wants Flashman to join with Brown, but to slow him down and prevent the raid into the South from ever happening, and therefore prevent civil war. Of course Flashman fails at this, and he becomes an eyewitness to the whole event.

As far as Flashman was concerned, he usually disliked anyone that nearly got him killed, and he says, \\"he was a sincere, worthy, autocratic, good-natured, terrible, dangerous old zealot, hard as nails, iron-willed, brave beyond belief, and possessed of all the muscular Christian virtues which I can't stand.\\" Later Flashman says, \\"there's a case to be made for saying he was the most evil influence ever let loose in North America.\\" Despite all this, Flashman clearly liked the man, and he even saves Brown's life towards the end. *George Edward Grey ‚Äì Governor of Cape Colony. *Allan Pinkerton ‚Äì A Scottish born detective. *William H.

The genus was named along with its type species O. mirus by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878 and currently includes five other species. As an ophiacodontid, Ophiacodon is one of the most basal synapsids and is close to the evolutionary line leading to mammals. Ophiacodon mirus Description including size  Skeleton of O. retroversus in the American Museum of Natural History, New York Ophiacodon has a large skull with a deep snout. It has the longest skull of any early synapsid, reaching up to in one specimen. The jaws are lined with many small teeth. It was larger than most other tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) of its time, ranging from in length and in weight. Specimens of Ophiacodon vary greatly in size. These differences in size were once used to distinguish species, but are now recognized as ontogenetic variations related to the ages of individuals. Smaller bones often have more poorly developed joint surfaces than larger bones, implying that they come from juvenile individuals while the larger bones come from adults. Analysis of the histology or microscopic anatomy of bones suggests that differences in size represent different growth stages rather than different species. Range Remains of Ophiacodon have been found in North America and Europe. * England: Kenilworth - CisuralianUnterpermische Pelycosaurier aus den englischen Midlands * France: Lower Permian of Autun * Canada: ** (?)Nova Scotia: Joggins Formation - Kasimovian * United States: ** Arizona: Cutler Formation - Cisuralian ** Colorado: Cutler Formation - Cisuralian ** Kansas: Fort Riley, Chase Group - Cisuralian ** New Mexico: Cutler Formation - Cisuralian ** Ohio: Green Formation, Dunkard Group CisuralianJohn J.

Ophiacodon most likely lived on land, but paleontologists have sometimes thought that it was semi-aquatic. An aquatic habitat for Ophiacodon was first proposed by paleontologist E. C. Case in 1907, although he later dismissed the idea. Anatomical features suggesting that it spent much of its time in the water include broad claws that seemed to be adaptations for paddling, thin jaws and numerous small teeth that seemed to be adapted for eating fish, and weakly developed bones, which are seen in many other secondarily aquatic tetrapods. In 1940, paleontologists Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price proposed that hindlimbs with a greater length than forelimbs was another aquatic adaptation of Ophiacodon, supposedly because the hindlimbs would have been used to propel it through water. Several of these features are no longer thought to be evidence of an aquatic lifestyle; for example, broad claws are seen in most early tetrapods, even those that are known to have been almost exclusively terrestrial, and the long hindlimbs of Ophiacodon would not have been an effective means of propulsion because the feet were still relatively small and had little surface area over which to form a paddle. Analysis of the vertebrae of Ophiacodon indicate that it was most likely terrestrial and spent little time in water. A paleobiological inference model for the femur likewise suggests a terrestrial lifestyle for Ophiacodon, even though the rather thick cortex might also suggest amphibious, rather than truly terrestrial habits. Skeletons of Ophiacodon show a fast growth pattern called fibrolamellar bone (FLB), suggesting at least partial warm-bloodedness. The FLB pattern is also found in birds and mammals.

Once a slum area, its many pubs, caf√©s, theatres and museums now make it seen as Brighton's bohemian and cultural quarter. History Looking east down Gloucester Road \\"Laine\\" is a Sussex dialect term for an open tract of land at the base of the Downs, which itself is derived from an Anglo-Saxon legal term for a kind of land holding. The space surrounding Brighton was once occupied by five of these \\"laines\\", open farming plots of a type that seem to have been generally unchanged in style since the Middle Ages, one of which was North Laine. By the 19th century, the farming plots (which had been for centuries subdivided into hides and furlongs) were encircled by major municipal roads for Brighton. With building developments across Brighton beginning to encroach upon the fields, the tracks that had divided the individual hide plots were normalized into streets, and the area was soon appropriated as a new settlement and market area. John Furner planted a market garden in the plots, and by 1840 a rail hub had been set up on the northern border of North Laine, Brighton railway station. During the reigns of George IV and William IV and through the first quarter of the reign of Queen Victoria, despite the grandeur of their Royal Pavilion, the North Laine section was known mostly for its squalor, abysmal living conditions and high concentration of slaughterhouses. One resident of note was George Herbert Volk, second son of railway engineer Magnus Volk, who worked in a small workshop at 86 Gloucester Road in the years 1910-1912. This building is now home to Silicon Beach Training. By the 1860s, the city began to clean up the area, knocking down old tenement houses (population density in one slum neighbourhood, Orange Row in the Pimlico slum district, was approximately 130 people to 17 houses) to replace them with more modern streets. A famous resident at this time was Tom Sayers, a popular British heavyweight boxing champion of the middle Victorian era. He was born in the Pimlico slum area and trained in North Laine. At his death in 1865, 10,000 people attended his funeral at Highgate, London. =1970s: Saved from demolition= Ken Fines (1923‚Äì2008) was Borough Planning Officer for Brighton from 1974 to 1983. He is credited with having saved the North Laine area from extensive redevelopment that could have seen existing buildings being replaced by new high-rise buildings, a flyover and a large car park. Fines felt the area had charm, and pressured the local council to retain it. After considerable opposition by council members and businesses, the council eventually came round to his view, and the North Laine Conservation Area was designated in 1977, named after his observation of the historic name. In North Road, in the centre of the North Laine area, is a plaque commemorating Fines. Today The Saturday market on Upper Gardner Street Today North Laine is a bohemian shopping area stretching from Trafalgar Street, Kensington Gardens, Sydney Street, Gardner Street and Bond Street - mostly pedestrianised - popular both with locals and tourists, well served with caf√©s, bars and entertainment venues including theatres such as Komedia, which is in a former Tesco supermarket. The latter had been closed for some years in anticipation of major redevelopment of the area which failed to materialise; in the building was for some time a covered market with a number of small stallholders, until Komedia moved in from their previous home in Kemptown. The first branch of Anita Roddick's Body Shop, later to become a multinational business, was opened at 22 Kensington Gardens. Typical retailers include art, antiques, architectural salvage, second-hand books, music, \\"retro\\" clothing, graphic novels, musical instruments and new age paraphernalia. There is a high turnover of boutique-style shops in North Laine in general. One of the less shopping-oriented streets, Upper Gardner Street, is closed to traffic every Saturday for an on-street market. Amongst the houses of this street are several antiques dealers. The North Laine has over 400 shops, including indoor flea markets, music shops, record shops, even an erotic emporium on three floors Lust! and a host of delicious independently- owned cafes and restaurants to suit all tastes. The City Council redeveloped a gap site, constructing a new library and public square, Jubilee Square, which became available to the public in 2005. This significantly changed the flow of pedestrians, which prior to this had been predominantly straight through North Laine on the main shopping streets, and is now more two-dimensional.

A right-hander, he played all or part of nine seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds (1984‚Äì90) and the Milwaukee Brewers (1990‚Äì92). Robinson is married to high school sweetheart Becky Robinson. They have three children, Ronnie, Ryan and Megan.  Early career  Robinson was drafted by the Reds out of Woodlake High School in Woodlake, California with their first-round pick (19th overall) in the 1980 amateur draft. He spent the next four years moving through the Reds' farm system before making his major league debut on August 14, 1984.  Major league career  = Reds = Although he had been almost exclusively a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, his first major league appearance came as a relief pitcher, pitching the final two innings of a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Four days later, he made his first major league start against the Chicago Cubs, but he recorded just one out while giving up seven runs. However, only one run was earned, as the Reds infield made three errors‚Äîtwo by shortstop Tom Foley -- behind him. After being sent back to the bullpen for several games, Robinson got another chance at starting on September 2 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. This time, he was much more successful, as he recorded a complete game, giving up just seven hits to gain his first major league win, 7‚Äì1. He threw seven shutout innings in his next start, but left with the game still scoreless and did not get the win as the Reds won 1‚Äì0. He started three more games, finishing the season with a record of 1‚Äì2. Robinson started the 1985 season back in the minor leagues with the Triple-A Denver Zephyrs. He was recalled in mid-May, and worked the rest of the season as a swingman, starting 12 games and relieving in 21. In 1986, Robinson, who was nicknamed \\"The True Creature\\" by then-Reds manager Pete Rose, worked solely in relief, appearing in 70 games, going 10‚Äì3 with a 3.24 ERA and 14 saves. In 1987, he returned to the swingman role. One of Robinson's most memorable starts came on May 2, 1988, when he came within one strike of throwing a perfect game against the Montreal Expos. With a single, Montreal's Wallace Johnson broke up what would have been the first perfect game in Reds history. According to teammate Tom Browning, Robinson was pitching with pain in his elbow so severe that he could not pick up a ball from the ground without squatting down to pick it up. Browning would throw the Reds' first perfect game four months later. Robinson missed large chunks of both 1988 and 1989 due to injuries. After starting the 1990 season 2‚Äì2 in 6 games, Cincinnati traded him to the Brewers along with pitcher Bob Sebra for power-hitting outfielder Glenn Braggs and infielder Billy Bates. The trade helped propel the Reds to win the 1990 World Series. = Brewers = The season also wound up being a good one for Robinson, at least statistically. Between his stints with the Reds and the Brewers, Robinson set career highs in wins and innings pitched, while recording seven of his eight career complete games, including his only two major league shutouts. Overall, Robinson went 14‚Äì7 with a 3.26 ERA. In 1991, Robinson started the third game of the season on April 11, pitching 4.1 innings, but in the process he suffered an elbow injury that cost him the rest of the season. He tried to come back in 1992, but pitched in just 8 games for the Brewers before being forced to retire at age 30. = Career overview = Robinson posted a career win-loss record of 48‚Äì39 with a 3.63 ERA and 19 saves in 232 games, 102 starts and 800 innings pitched.

It is the eleventh of the Flashman books. Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the supposedly discovered historical Flashman Papers, this book describes the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to Flashman, who is not only the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, but also a well-known Victorian military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note detailing the discovery of these papers. It also states that smaller narratives have been discovered mixed in with the larger packets which comprise the previous books. Flashman and the Tiger is a collection of three of these narratives. \\"The Road to Charing Cross\\" is the longest, detailing Flashman's involvement in preventing an assassination attempt on Emperor Franz Josef. It takes place in 1878 and from 1883 to 1884. \\"The Subtleties of Baccarat\\" describes the Tranby Croft affair in 1890 to 1891. \\"Flashman and the Tiger\\", covering 1879 and 1894, borrows some characters from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for a tale about blackmail and revenge. It is also the only Flashman story to give any detail about his adventures with the Zulus. The title story had been originally serialised in the Daily Express, between 29 September 1975 and 3 October 1975, with illustrations by Andrew Robb. Plot summary \\"The Road to Charing Cross\\" begins with Flashman going to Berlin with Henri Blowitz to help him get a copy of the Treaty of Berlin and publish it before anyone else has it. He also meets Caprice, a beautiful member of the French secret service. Five years later, Flashman is looking for an excuse to leave London and avoid being sent to Sudan with Charles George Gordon. Luckily, a letter from Blowitz arrives inviting him to Paris. He rides the maiden voyage of the Orient Express and makes the acquaintance of a princess, Kralta, supposedly so that she can sleep with him. This turns out to be a ruse on the part of the princess and Otto von Bismarck, and Flashman is forced to join with Rupert Willem von Starnberg, son of the villain from Royal Flash, and save Emperor Franz Josef from assassination by Magyar nationalists. It turns out that Starnberg has plans of his own, and Flashman must save both the Emperor and himself. \\"The Subtleties of Baccarat\\" has Flashman at the home of Sir Arthur Wilson with the Prince of Wales, just when the royal baccarat scandal is unfolding. Unlike in most Flashman stories, he is mainly an observer of the event, simply giving bad advice when asked to. However, in a twist, someone he has known for years unexpectedly turns out to be the most important player in the story. At the beginning of \\"Flashman and the Tiger\\", Flashman is in South Africa fleeing from the Battle of Isandlwana in a wagon. After his escape, he meets Tiger Jack Moran about ten miles (16 km) away, and both head to Rorke's Drift and the nightmare that awaits them. Later, at the mention of Flashman's name, Moran says \\"if I'd only known.\\" Years later, in 1894, Flashman finds out what he meant when Moran blackmails his granddaughter in order to sleep with her, revealing to Flashman that he was a cabin boy on Captain John Charity Spring's ship, the Balliol College (see Flash for Freedom!), who was traded to King Gezo as a white slave and has spent much of his adult life avenging himself on the ship's former crew. In an attempt to save her, Flashman finds himself in a scene from \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\", and has to endure the humiliation of Sherlock Holmes analysing him while he is pretending to be a drunken tramp.

History  Basha High School was named after Eddie Basha, Jr., who made donations in the millions of dollars to the Chandler Unified School District (CUSD) and lived in the community until his death in 2013. Kristine Marchiando, the school's principal since its inception, retired on June 20, 2008. The CUSD school board appointed Ken James, a former Gilbert Public School District Executive Director of Educational Services, as the new principal on July 1, 2008.  Academics  Basha abides by the standards set by the Arizona Department of Education and implements the state's Education and Career Action Plan (ECAP) required for all students 9-12 grade students to graduate from a public Arizona high school. CUSD high schools also implements an open enrollment policy, meaning students from outside the intended school boundaries may attend without tuition or other penalties. Arizona requires that all high school students take 6 credit bearing courses during their freshmen through junior years, and have the option of reducing credits to 4 credit bearing courses if they are track for graduation. However, CUSD requires all students must complete 22 credits whereas the public university system controlled by the Arizona Board of Regents requires only 16 credits in the following areas: * English - 4 credits * Mathematics - 4 credits * Science - 3 credits * Social Studies. - 3 credits * Career and Technical Educator/Fine Arts - 1 credit * Physical Education - 1 credit * Comprehensive Health - ¬Ω credits * Elective Courses - 5 ¬Ω credits = Cross-credit courses = At Basha and all CUSD high school students may swap three semesters (¬Ω credits per semester) of Spiritline, Beginning through Advance Dance, Drill Team, Color Guard, Marching Band, Winter guard, or AFJROTC essentially waiving the required one Physical Education credit required for graduation. Students which choose applied sciences in areas such as Applied Biology or Applied Agricultural Sciences gain equivalent Science credits. Likewise, Economics credits can be awarded like Agricultural Business Management, Business, Business Applications, Marketing, Economics Applications, Family and Consumer Sciences, and vocational courses. Community college credits can be awarded through a partnership with Chandler-Gilbert Community College (CGCC) and cooperative credits for vocational courses are provided by East Valley Institute of Technology (EVIT). Students must be dually enrolled for the Arizona community college or the Arizona public university system to accept the credits towards a degree. CUSD Transportation Department provides routes between Basha, EVIT, and CGCC with after school hours transportation intended for students participating in activities. = Other Programs = Separate from EVIT and CGCC, the University of Arizona implemented a pilot program to get university credits for students pursuing introductory engineering courses starting in 2014. Basha has an Advanced Middle School Program on campus (AMS). The AMS program has grades 6, 7 and 8. AMS students have access to high school teachers and equipment.  Extracurricular activities  = Athletics = Basha is an Arizona Interscholastic Association (AIA) member school offering boys and girls sports complying with Title IX. Student athletes can participate in varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen only teams as well as individual athletics in: * Badminton * Baseball * Basketball (Boys) * Basketball (Girls) * Cheer * Cross Country * Football * Golf (Boys) * Golf (Girls) * Hockey Competitive * Lacrosse (Girls) * Pomline * Soccer (Boys) * Soccer (Girls) * Softball * Swim and Dive * Tennis (Boys) * Tennis (Girls) * Track and field * Volleyball (Boys) * Volleyball (Girls) * Wrestling  Cheer  Basha's cheer team have been Arizona's state champion for the past two years.

The series also featured musical interludes from a live band, fronted by Christian Reilly. The show ran for three series between 2004 and 2008. Herring was assisted each week by TV's Emma Kennedy, Dan Tetsell and Danny Robins. Tetsell and Robins never appeared as themselves (bar a couple of short segments), but rather as characters in sketches or as special guests. Each show would contain sketches based on historical events, the anniversary of which would be around the date of transmission. A running joke in the second series was that Radio 2 had commissioned it so that the final episodes went out at the same time of year as the first episodes of the first series, meaning that exactly the same anniversaries were coming around as for the first. The earlier part of the series featured a running joke as to whether such a show should acknowledge the anniversary of the September 11 attacks, and debate as to whether ignoring it would be more offensive than not ignoring it. Regular Features =TWTTIN= As with This Morning With Richard Not Judy and later, As It Occurs To Me, Herring made the show's title in to an unwieldy acronym, which was repeated by the audience every time it was said. =TV's Emma Kennedy's Births, Deaths and Marriages= Emma Kennedy's main section in the series looked at births, deaths and marriages from that week in history. These are invariably curtailed by Richard Herring, who would pick holes in Kennedy's jokes before berating her for being mawkish. The section featured the jingle \\"It's time to find out who got wed, bred or dead, with TV's Emma Kenned... dy\\". Later in the series, Kennedy tried out various formats, all of which were treated with equal disdain by Herring. =What Reaaaallllly Happened= Herring looks back at historical events revealing a humorous \\"truth\\" about the incident. Herring explains that the word \\"really\\" is spelt with four As and five Ls. =The Song= Each week, as well as providing the stings for the show, halfway through the show Reilly and the band would play a song based on a historical event. Sometimes these were pastiches of well known songs with a link to the event. =History Corner= In the first series, History Corner was a small library full of history books from which Herring's \\"time team\\" would find facts from that week in history. In series one, the Tetsell and Robins played recurring characters Mr. Morgan and Brian O'Green, respectively. Mr. Morgan was Richard's old history teacher and through the first series had a breakdown after declaring his marriage a sham and his love for an ex-pupil in the first episode. As the series went along, he turned to alcoholism and used the show to beg forgiveness from his wife Hilary. Mr. Morgan never appeared in the second and third series and was never mentioned again. Potentially he perished in the indoor bonfire and fireworks display which ended the first series, but this has never been confirmed. Brian O'Green (Robins) was an \\"inter-nerd\\" Richard knew from the local pub quiz team. His obsessions included Star Trek, the Nazis and conspiracy theories and unlike Mr. Morgan, he featured as a semi-regular character throughout all three series. The name Brian O'Green was also used as a character name in Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World. =Conspiracy Theory Corner= Brian O'Green's semi regular feature in which he reveals his own conspiracy theories to a cynical Herring; all of which are completely nonsensical. =The Marriage of Richard Herring and TV's Emma Kennedy= During the series, a complex love triangle formed between Herring, Kennedy and Reilly. Herring frequently let slip his affections for Reilly, all of which were firmly rejected. In series two, after finding out the Reilly had married, Herring got engaged to Kennedy for a bet, not realising that due to BBC compliance, all TV and radio marriages had been made legally binding. Despite claiming to hate each other, Kennedy reveals that in fact she loves Herring, who concedes that he loves her too. In the last series, Herring and Kennedy's marriage shows signs of strain when Herring, emulating his hero Henry VIII, orders for Kennedy to be beheaded. However, Kennedy reveals that she is pregnant with Herring's baby and therefore cannot be executed. In the last episode, it is revealed that the baby is in fact Reilly's and the two leave Herring to form a three-way relationship with Reilly's wife, taking all the show's characters with them.

It is the twelfth and last Flashman novel. Plot introduction As in all of Fraser's Flashman novels, the story is presented as part of the Flashman Papers, supposedly written by Sir Harry Flashman, the villain of Tom Brown's School Days. It begins with the usual explanatory note detailing the discovery of the papers. The adventure is set in 1867-8 and starts in Trieste, shortly after Flashman's service with Emperor Maximilian I in Mexico. Flashman then travels to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and takes part in General Robert Napier's 1868 expedition. Plot summary Having fled Mexico aboard the Austrian warship carrying the Emperor Maximilian's body home for burial, Flashman is on the run, after mortally offending Admiral Tegethoff by seducing his great-niece en voyage. Flashman meets an old acquaintance, Jack Speedicut (who appears in other of the novels), who enlists him to escort a shipment of Maria Theresa thalers to General Robert Napier's forces in Abyssinia, via Suez. General Napier, overjoyed to find the noted military hero Flashman arrived in Abyssinia, immediately despatches him on a secret undercover mission to recruit Queen Masteeat and her Galla people, who are opposed to Emperor Theodore II of Ethiopia, travelling in the company of her half-sister Uliba- Wark, who is herself scheming to depose Queen Masteeat. Flashman succeeds in enlisting the assistance of Queen Masteeat, but is then captured by Emperor Theodore's forces. The second half of the novel deals with Flashman's relations with the Emperor and covers the final battle with Napier's forces and their allies, after which Theodore commits suicide. Flashman tells Napier at the conclusion that the British government could have avoided the whole sorry adventure if they had simply given Theodore the respect that a monarch deserves by properly responding to his letters.

For example, describing someone who has broken a law as a criminal. Labelling theory is a theory in sociology which ascribes labelling of people to control and identification of deviant behaviour. It has been argued that labelling is necessary for communication. However, the use of the term is often intended to highlight the fact that the label is a description applied from the outside, rather than something intrinsic to the labelled thing. This can be done for several reasons: *To provoke a discussion about what the best description is *To reject a particular label *To reject the whole idea that the labelled thing can be described in a short phrase. This last usage can be seen as an accusation that such a short description is overly-reductive. Giving something a label can be seen as positive, but the term label is not usually used in this case. For example, giving a name to a common identity is seen as essential in identity politics. Labelling is often equivalent to pigeonholing or the use of stereotypes and can suffer from the same problems as these activities. The labelling of people can be related to a reference group. For example, the labels black and white are related to black people and white people; the labels young and old are related to young people and old people. The labelling of works of art can be related to genre. For example, a piece of music may be described as progressive rock or indie or ragga jungle drum and bass. However, there are other labels that can be applied to a work, such as derivative, low or high. The use of the word labelling is less common in the context of works of art than people. However, it also often represents the rejection of a label. For example, an artist may feel that the labeller is attempting to restrict the scope of the artist's work to that which is covered by the label.  Labelling systems on the World Wide Web  Labelling on the Web represent the chunks of information in our information environments and labelling is perhaps the most obvious way to show a site's organization schemes across multiple systems and contexts. Labelling systems are one of the major components in information architecture, and one of the first steps of an information architecture project is to identify, organize and label relevant chunks of information. When creating labels, the goal is to communicate efficiently, and without taking up too much space. Labels should be written in a language that's familiar to the users, and in a way that they will detect new and recognize similar concepts. In an information environment, labels occur in 2 formats ‚Äì textual and iconic: = Textual labels = Contextual links are hyperlinks to chunks of information on other pages or another location on the same page and need to draw meaning from their surrounding text. Headings: Labels are often used as headings to present subsequent information and create a hierarchy within contents. A hierarchical relationship between headings is established visually through consistent use of numbering, font size, color and styles, white spaces, indentation, or a combination of these items. Navigation system choices: There is no standard for a navigation system but common categories might be: * Main, Main Page, Home * Search, Find, Browse, Search/Browse * Site Map, Contents, Table of contents, Index * Contact, Contact Us * Help, FAQ, * News, News and events, News and announcements, Announcements * About, About us, About, Who we are. Index terms are often referred to as keywords, tags, descriptive metadata, taxonomies, controlled vocabularies, and thesauri. Such labelling systems can describe any type of content such as sites, subsites, pages, or content chunks. = Iconic labels = Icons can serve as a substitute for text to represent information. Iconic labels are used as navigation systems, especially in mobile apps, where screen space is constrained.  Labelling in argumentation  In context of argumentation and debate, labelling a debator or position is often (whether consciously or unconsciously) used as a \\"red herring\\" to divert or dismiss the argument, instead of valid argumentation. Often in the form of ad hominem association fallacy aiming at accrediting or discrediting the argument or the debator by associating them with an emotionally charged label. Typically negatively; labelling it as ridiculous or despicable, though it can also go the other way round; attempting to gain sympathy for example by promoting the debator or position as authoritative, or by appealing to pity. - Using labelling in argumentation this way constitute an informal fallacy. - For example: > The guy believed that it can be done with the right technology. *The guy is > a perverted pansy. (ie. Therefore it can never be done.) > The witness claim to have seen something that indicates foul play. *It is > paranoid to assume foul play. (ie. Therefore whatever the witness might have > seen is irrelevant.) > Markings indicate that it was done with a crowbar. - And secondly, Mr X is a > suspect.. *It is ridiculous to suspect mr X. (ie. Therefore it is also > ridiculous to assume it was done with a crowbar.) > It has been suggested that something it said in the book could be wrong. *It > is a very noble book. (ie. Therefore the suggestion is wrong.)

North Shewa takes its name from the kingdom or former province of Shewa. The Zone is bordered on the south and the west by the Oromia Region, on the north by South Wollo, on the northeast by the Oromia Zone, and on the east by the Afar Region. The highest point in the Zone is Mount Abuye Meda (4012 meters), which is found in Gish Rabel woreda; other prominent peaks include Mount Megezez. Towns and cities in North Shewa include Ankober, Debre Berhan, and Shewa Robit. The administrative subdivisions of this Zone have been renamed, divided, and their boundaries were redrawn numerous times between the 1994 and 2007 national censuses far more often than any other Zone in the Amhara Region. As a result, its subdivisions can be very confusing; Svein Ege, in his comparison of how the Central Statistical Agency (CSA) and the Ethiopian Mapping Authority reported the administrative boundaries in this Zone and how they changed between 1994 and 2004, stopped halfway through this Zone, stating that he had run out of time to perform field checking.Ege, \\"North Sh√§wa 1:100,000.

During its history since 1964 and till today, Charter Arms has produced revolvers chambered in the following calibers: .22 Long Rifle, .22 Winchester Magnum, .32 Long, .32 H&R; Magnum, .327 Federal Magnum, .357 Magnum, .38 Special, 9x19mm Parabellum, .40 Smith & Wesson, .41 Remington Magnum, .44 Special, .45 ACP and .45 Colt. The most famous revolvers manufactured by Charter Arms are the .44 Special Bulldog and .38 Special Bulldog Pug. History Douglas McClenahan, a young gun designer who had previously worked for Colt, High Standard, and Sturm, Ruger founded Charter Arms in 1964 to produce handguns. His first pistol was a five-shot revolver called \\"The Undercover\\" chambered for .38 Special. McClenahan's innovation was to avoid using the side plate designs manufactured by other revolver makers for a one-piece frame, giving the new revolver a strength that allowed it to safely shoot high loads.Charter Arms FAQ McClenahan also reduced the number of moving parts used in the gun and created a safety device for the firing pin. The company, then located in Stratford, Connecticut, went bankrupt in the 1990s, but the Charter design and mark were resurrected by Charter 2000, which was founded by the Ecker family. The new company capitalized on the fame of the old Charter Arms revolvers. Operations were moved to Shelton, Connecticut. Basing their new line of weapons on the basic Charter Arms design, the new company has made a few improvements such as the use of a one-piece barrel and front sight. The one-piece barrels of the new models are machined with eight grooves instead of six for higher velocity, flatter trajectory and better accuracy. The new models feature a completely blocked hammer system so that the gun cannot fire unless the trigger is held in full rear position. In addition to reintroducing the .38 Special Undercover and the .44 Special Bulldog, Charter 2000 produces revolvers chambered for .22 Long Rifle/.22 Magnum (the Pathfinder), .357 magnum (the Mag Pug) and .38 Special (the Off-Duty and the Police Bulldog). In 2005, Charter 2000 announced that it would be filing for bankruptcy, blaming the costs associated with nuisance lawsuits for their financial trouble. In September 2005, MKS Supply entered into an agreement with Charter Arms where MKS Supply would handle the sales, marketing and distribution for Charter Arms. In 2008, Charter Arms brought the new Patriot revolvers to the market. The Patriot revolvers were chambered for the .327 Federal Magnum, and were available in 2.2\\" or 4\\" stainless steel models. The Charter Arms web site as of August 2011 no longer lists this model under the products category. Also in 2008, Charter Arms announced a new revolver: the Charter Arms Rimless Revolver. The new revolver would be able to load and fire rimless cartridges such as the 9mm, .40 S&W;, and .45 ACP without the need for moon clips. Initially, the revolver was to ship in early spring, however, reported problems with the patents delayed the introduction. Charter Arms set a release date of April 2009 for the CARR. However, Charter Arms missed this deadline, and company representatives have suggested the release date may not be until \\"late July\\" of 2009. The CARR which was subsequently called the Pitbull finally reached production in August 2011 and the first Pitbull models had a 2.3\\" barrel and were chambered for the .40 S&W; cartridge as this is the most popular U.S. law enforcement round and would enable the Pitbull to be used as a back-up gun to the .40 service pistol.Charter Arms website In October 2010 MKS discontinued the sales and marketing of Charter Arms. Charter now has taken over the sales and marketing function. At SHOT Show 2018 Charter introduced the .41 Remington Magnum Mag Pug and the .45 Colt Bulldog XL.

The four raced at the July 10, 1949 race at the Daytona Beach Road Course, which was the first event to feature a brother and a sister, and the only NASCAR event to feature four siblings. Ethel beat Fonty and Bob by finishing in eleventh. Racing career =Moonshine= Like many early NASCAR drivers, Flock's career began by delivering illegal moonshine. He started delivering on his bicycle as a teenager. He used his car to deliver moonshine as he got older. \\"I used to deliberately seek out the sheriff and get him to chase me,\\" he later recalled. \\"It was fun, and besides we could send to California to get special parts to modify our cars, and the sheriff couldn't afford to do that.\\" =Early career= Flock won a 100-mile race at Lakewood Speedway Park in Atlanta, Georgia in 1940. He raced on dirt tracks in Georgia. He qualified in the pole position for the July 27, 1941 race at the Daytona Beach Road Course beside Roy Hall. Flock took the early lead, before he and Hall got together in the south turn. Flock rolled and landed upside down in bushes. The seatbelt broke during the rolling, and Flock was tossed around. He was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, having suffered a crushed chest, broken pelvis, head and back injuries, and severe shock. =World War II= Flock was in the United States Army Air Corps for four years during World War II. =NASCAR career= His brother convinced car owner Ed Schenck to put Flock in his car at the first race at the North Wilkesboro Speedway on May 5, 1947.

Film music critics noted that the score also borrows from works by Richard Wagner, particularly themes from Siegfried and G√∂tterd√§mmerung, included in the latter half of \\"The Might of Rome\\" and \\"Am I Not Merciful?\\"Filmtracks.com In 2003 Luciano Pavarotti released the song \\"Il gladiatore\\" from his album Ti Adoro. The song was based on a theme from the score, featured on the soundtrack as track 4, \\"Earth\\". Pavarotti told Billboard magazine that he was meant to sing this song in the film, \\"But I said no then. Too bad. It's a magnificent song and a tough movie. Still, there is so much drama in just the song.\\" The \\"Il gladiatore\\" version of this song, was performed by Andrea Bocelli during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final in Rome, where FC Barcelona defeated Manchester United F.C. and also during the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final in Milan, where Real Madrid C.F. was proclaimed Champion of Europe when defeating the Club Atl√©tico de Madrid.

It is found from British Columbia and southeastern Alberta, through the western United States to northern Mexico. The bird's habitat is dry, open areas with grasses or shrubs, and even stony desert slopes with very little vegetation. Many northern birds migrate to winter within the breeding range in central and western Mexico, though some remain further north. The common poorwill is the only bird known to go into torpor for extended periods (weeks to months). This happens on the southern edge of its range in the United States, where it spends much of the winter inactive, concealed in piles of rocks. Such an extended period of torpor is close to a state of hibernation and is not known among other birds.  Taxonomy  The common poorwill was illustrated and formally described in 1844 by the ornithologist John James Audubon from a male specimen collected on the eastern bank of the Missouri River between Fort Pierre and mouth of the Cheyenne River in South Dakota. Audubon coined the binomial name Camprimulgus nuttallii, choosing the specific epithet to honour his friend, the ornithologist Thomas Nuttall. The species was moved to its own genus Phalaenoptilus by the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway in 1880. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek phalaina meaning \\"moth\\" and ptilon meaning \\"plumage\\". Six subspecies are recognised: * P. n. nutalli (Audubon, 1844) ‚Äì breeds over most of the North American range. * P. n. californicus Ridgway, 1887 ‚Äì dusky poorwill, is darker and browner than the nominate race. It occurs in western California and north Baja California * P. n. hueyi Dickey, 1928 ‚Äì desert poorwill, is paler than the nominate race. It occurs in southeast California, southwest Arizona (USA) and northeast Baja California * P. n. dickeyi Grinnell, 1928 ‚Äì San Ignacio poorwill, is smaller and less heavily marked than californicus. It is resident in southern Baja California. * P. n. adustus Van Rossem, 1941 ‚Äì Sonoran poorwill, is paler and browner than the nominate race. It occurs from extreme southern Arizona to north Mexico. * P. n. centralis Moore, RT, 1947 ‚Äì central Mexico  Description  This is the smallest North American nightjar, about in length, with a wingspan of approximately . It weighs . The sexes are similar, both gray and black patterned above. The outer tail-feathers are tipped with white, the markings slightly more prominent in the male. The common poorwill is told from similar nightjars by its small size, short bill, rounded wings with tips that reach the end of the short tail at rest, and pale gray coloration. Like many other nightjars, the common name derives from its call, a monotonous poor-will given from dusk to dawn. At close range a third syllable of the call may be heard, resulting in a poor-will-low. It also gives a chuck note in flight.  Behavior  The common poorwill is the only bird known to go into torpor for extended periods (weeks to months). This happens on the southern edge of its range in the United States, where it spends much of the winter inactive, concealed in piles of rocks. This behavior has been reported in California and New Mexico. Such an extended period of torpor is close to a state of hibernation, not known among other birds. It was described definitively by Dr. Edmund Jaeger in 1948 based on a poorwill he discovered hibernating in the Chuckwalla Mountains of California in 1946. Common Poorwill, Phalaenoptilus nuttallii. Nominate race in foreground, Dusky Poorwill, Phalaenoptilus nuttalli californicus, in background. In 1804, Meriwether Lewis observed hibernating common poorwills in North Dakota during the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Though these observations were recorded carefully in Lewis's journal, their significance was not understood. This was at least in part because the common poorwill was not then recognized as a species distinct from the whip-poor-will of eastern North America. Native Americans of the Hopi tribe were likely aware of the poorwill's behavior even earlier ‚Äî the Hop√≠lavayi name of this bird, h√∂lchko, means \\"The Sleeping One\\". =Breeding= Breeding is from March to August in the south of the range, and late May to September further north. The nest of the common poorwill is a shallow scrape on the ground, often at the base of a hill and frequently shaded partly by a bush or clump of grass. The clutch size is typically two, and the eggs are white to creamy, or pale pink, sometimes with darker mottling. Both sexes incubate for 20‚Äì21 days to hatching, with another 20‚Äì23 days to fledging. There is usually one brood per year, but females may sometimes lay and incubate a second clutch within 100 m of the first nest while the male feeds young at the first site. The young are semiprecocial. An adult disturbed on the nest tumbles and opens its mouth, hissing, apparently imitating a snake. =Food and feeding= Like other members of this family it feeds on nocturnal insects such as moths, beetles, and grasshoppers. It ejects pellets of the indigestible parts, in the manner of an owl. The common poorwill frequently takes prey off of the ground or by leaping into the air from the ground. It is reported to drink on the wing.  References  * Cleere and Nurney, 1998. Nightjars, * Paul R. Ehrlich; David S. Dobkin; and Darryl Wheye, 1988. The Birder's Handbook.

Westinghouse Park is a city- block sized municipal park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The park land is the former estate of George Westinghouse, an American entrepreneur and engineer, and his wife Marguerite. With an area of about 10 acres, it was the site of his mansion known as Solitude. At this house, Westinghouse worked with his engineers, including Nikola Tesla, and entertained notable people of the day, including scientist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and congressman and later president William McKinley. Close by was another building, a carriage house, that housed his private laboratory in the basement. There, he developed some of his residential electric lighting technology, installing a generator and running cables to the main house, with wires that were left exposed on the interior walls, so as not to cut into the woodwork. Also there, Westinghouse invented methods to control and transmit natural gas for both industrial and residential consumers. In the winter of 1883/1884, seeking a source of natural gas in his own \\"back yard,\\" Westinghouse ordered drilling on his estate. When gas was struck on May 22, 1884, a blowout resulted in the uncontrolled release of gas for about a week. Westinghouse devised a way to cap the well. An illumination test was conducted by igniting the gas jet at the top of a tall pipe. It initially produced a 100-foot flame that illuminated a mile-wide area to a brightness sufficient to read a newspaper. This well was designated as \\"Westinghouse Well No. 1\\" or \\"Old No. 1\\" to distinguish it from several other wells that were drilled in the area. Eventually, several natural gas derricks towered above the estate's Victorian gardens. In modern times there is no above-ground trace left of these derricks. History The park's history began when Westinghouse, upon his death in 1914, bequeathed the North Point Breeze mansion to his son, who in turn sold the property in 1918 to the Engineers' Society of Western Pennsylvania. The Society's intent was to establish both a city park and a memorial to Westinghouse there. As per a deed stipulation, the house was razed in 1919 and the park was developed; the Westinghouse Memorial, however, was erected a few miles away in Schenley Park. Westinghouse Park today is maintained by the City of Pittsburgh. The park hosts a well-used children's playground, a basketball court, and a community building used for meetings and as a 14th Ward polling (voting) station. Disused tunnels are still in evidence from the site of the former house to the laboratory and to the nearby railroad tracks. The park is bounded on three sides by residential streets of the North Point Breeze neighborhood, while on its north side are rail lines and a busway. On its southern side, across Thomas Boulevard, was the former estate of industrialist and entrepreneur H. J. Heinz, with a mansion known as Greenlawn, now replaced by smaller, mostly late Victorian residences. Within sight of the Park are the still-extant houses of Westinghouse's son on Murtland Avenue and of his personal physician on Thomas Blvd. Nearby in Point Breeze on Penn Avenue is the mansion called Clayton, on the former estate of industrialist Henry Clay Frick. Writer John Edgar Wideman made frequent references to the park in his books. Both of his memoirs, Brothers and Keepers and Hoop Roots, use the park as a setting, as does his fictional Homewood Trilogy. In 2006, archeological exploration found numerous small artifacts and reestablished the location of the long-vanished gas well.Lowry, Patricia, \\"Vanished Westinghouse estate here yields some secrets,\\" May 2, 2006, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (accessed Nov 1 2013) An excellent view of the park, showing some of the ancient specimen trees, can be found at Ref. In 2019, the Westinghouse Park 2nd Century Coalition was formed to improve the park's facilities, explore and exhibit its Westinghouse history, and to provide it with on-going stewardship. See external link 2 below. Gallery Shown here are several images related to the historic Westinghouse Park site. First is a photograph of the mansion Solitude seen from the east, from Lang Avenue. One sees a three-story house with a four- story tower and a mansard roof. An enclosed porch wraps around to the south. Sun awnings on the windows and leafy trees indicate a summer setting. The excellent condition of the house suggests the photograph predates the death of George Westinghouse in 1914. Next is another photo of the same house from the south, from about the distance of Thomas Boulevard. A corner of the former greenhouse is seen on the far left. Next is a photograph taken before 1890 of the gas derrick that became known as the \\"Westinghouse Old No.1\\" well in present-day Westinghouse Park. This picture shows also the carriage house and the mansion Solitude on the far right. A second derrick is also visible. The view is from the south, from present-day Thomas Boulevard. Small figures of children and workers can be seen near the well. An article in Harper's Weekly in 1885 featured an article on \\"The Gas Wells of Pennsylvania,\\" and included an engraving of Westinghouse's \\"Old No.1\\" derrick flaming as an \\"illuminator\\" at night. The article extolls the revolutionary nature of using cheap natural gas as an alternative to dirty and expensive coal by industry and households, and the bonanza the recent discovery of this resource in Western Pennsylvania would bring to the economy of the region.

A tall and softly-spoken American prospector, who made his fortune in a silver strike in Nevada, he is visiting the 'old country' to see his roots. He goes to London where he meets and has a one-night stand with 'Pip' Delys, a music hall performer. She gives him the name which forms the title of the book. He then buys a house in Castle Lancing, the Norfolk village his ancestors came from in the 17th century. A chance event during a fox hunt, when the fox hides in Franklin's picnic basket, leads to an acquaintance with King Edward VII, and the beginning of an enmity with a neighbour (Frank, Lord Lacy) which lasts throughout the book. Through playing bridge with Edward and his mistress Alice Keppel, Franklin elevates himself greatly in the king's estimation through his easy manners. When the king invites him to Sandringham, Franklin meets Winston Churchill, Jackie Fisher, and Ernest Cassel. This allows Fraser to depict some of the historical background of the build-up to the First World War. He also meets General Flashman, from Fraser's well-known historical fiction series. Flashman is in his late 80s at the start of the book (as he says, \\"I'm eighty-eight next May, and I attribute my longevity to an almost total abstinence from tea\\"), and an important sub-plot involves his grand-niece, Lady Helen Cessford, a suffragette. An old partner in crime, Kid Curry, tracks him down and demands half of all his wealth. Franklin refuses, and the stage is set for a midnight gunfight, which Franklin wins with the assistance of his manservant Samson. They bury the body in a field. He falls in love with, and marries, another neighbour, Peggy Clayton. Her brother is an officer in the British Army and is involved in running guns to Ireland during the Curragh Mutiny, using Franklin's money obtained by Peggy from him by deception. Over the years, Franklin gradually grows apart from his young wife, at first due to the breach of trust over the money, and then when he discovers her sexual infidelity. The novel ends with the outbreak of war in 1914, and Franklin deciding to return to the US, leaving the bulk of his fortune in England for his wife and her family. At the last moment, he changes his mind, and the reader is left unsure whether he intends to return to his unfaithful wife, to possibly accompany Samson who plans to serve in the Legion of Frontiersmen under Frederick Selous, or something else entirely.

He was best known for his role as Captain Wallace Binghamton in the 1960s ABC television situation comedy McHale's Navy. He was also a frequent guest star on 1960s TV shows, such as Batman, and appeared in several Walt Disney film comedies. Early years He was born to a physician in Youngstown, Ohio. Flynn graduated from Rayen High School there and attended Northwestern University. During World War II he served in the Army Special Services Branch entertaining the troops, before moving west, in 1946, to pursue acting and to complete his education. He majored in political science at the University of Southern California. Early career Lon Chaney, Jr., Joe Flynn and Robert Shayne in Indestructible Man (1956) Flynn's interest in theater was evident well before his departure from northeastern Ohio. He established himself early on as a ventriloquist and radio disc jockey. Flynn also gained local celebrity as a director by guiding the Canfield Players in such productions as Harvey, Antigone, and Pursuit of Happiness. He broke into television in pre-network days and, in 1948, starred in his own situation comedy, Yer Old Buddy. The show was a local affair, produced and broadcast by pioneering Los Angeles station KTLA. After appearing in a number of stage plays, Flynn returned to Youngstown, where in 1950, he conducted an unsuccessful campaign for a seat in the Ohio Senate as a Republican. Following his electoral defeat, he pursued his acting career and appeared in nearly 30 films, including many Disney films. Flynn later recalled watching an audience's reaction to his performance in the 1956 horror film The Indestructible Man starring Lon Chaney, Jr.. Although he played a serious part in the picture, people laughed, which convinced him that comedy was his forte. He also starred in several episodes of the syndicated 1957-1958 series The Silent Service, a show dedicated to the US Navy's submarine service during World War II. He played Mr. Kelley in 15 episodes of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and appeared in other classic series such as The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, The Twilight Zone, and Make Room for Daddy. Over the years, Flynn achieved recognition in television, earning credits as a regular on William Bendix's The Life of Riley and on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. He appeared at least twice on NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. His appearance on March 30, 1961, was a patriotic program set at sea on a United States Navy aircraft carrier. He guest starred on Walter Brennan's ABC sitcom, The Real McCoys, Tab Hunter‚Ä≤s NBC sitcom The Tab Hunter Show, and on the syndicated western, Pony Express. In 1961, Flynn was cast as a regular on the first season of NBC's The Joey Bishop Show, but left early, reportedly because he was stealing too many scenes from Joey Bishop. That same year, he guest starred on the Peggy Cass and Jack Weston series The Hathaways, an unusual sitcom about a suburban Los Angeles couple that adopts three chimpanzees. He appeared, too, in Edmond O'Brien's syndicated 1960 crime drama, Johnny Midnight and earlier on Jim Davis's syndicated adventure series, Rescue 8.  McHale's Navy  From 1962 to 1966, Flynn played the irascible Captain Wallace \\"Wally\\" Burton Binghamton (also known as \\"Old Leadbottom\\") on ABC's McHale's Navy, in which he became known for his exasperated catch phrases \\"What is it, What, WHAT, WHAT!?\\", \\"What in the name of: the Blue Pacific/Halsey/Nimitz\\", and \\"I could just scream!\\" He also starred in two 1964 theatrical films spun off from the series, McHale's Navy and McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force. In the spring of 1970, Flynn co-starred with Tim Conway ‚Äî with whom he had worked in McHale's Navy and the two McHale's Navy films ‚Äî in the situation comedy The Tim Conway Show as the inept operators of the single-plane charter airline Triple A Airlines. The unsuccessful show ran for only 12 episodes. Besides the two McHale's Navy films, Flynn's career in feature films included the 1963 comedy Son of Flubber, in which he had a small part as a television announcer; Flynn later starred as Medfield College's Dean Higgins in a trio of Disney Studio films, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969), Now You See Him, Now You Don't (1972), and The Strongest Man in the World (1975), his final live-action film. Flynn also appeared in Did You Hear the One About the Traveling Saleslady? (1968), The Love Bug (1968), The Barefoot Executive (1971), The Million Dollar Duck (1971), How to Frame a Figg (1971) starring Don Knotts, Superdad (1973) starring Bob Crane, and The Girl Most Likely To... (1973), a made-for- television dark comedy written by Joan Rivers.  Later career and death  Flynn co-starred with Tim Conway in The Tim Conway Show in 1970. Flynn played the role of the boss of a small airline and Conway played its pilot. Throughout his life, Flynn maintained a strong connection to his hometown; and from 1969 to the year of his death, he was involved in northeastern Ohio's Kenley Players. He often returned to Youngstown to visit family residing on Elm Street, on the city's north side. In recognition of his contributions to the broadcasting field, Flynn became the ninth recipient of the Ohio Association of Broadcasters Award. In the early 1970s, Flynn spearheaded a movement on behalf of the Screen Actors Guild for more equitable distribution of TV residual payments. He made a dozen appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1972 and 1973. He hosted a revised edition of It Pays to Be Ignorant and was a guest panelist on the hit game show series Match Game '74 on January 17, 1974 (recorded on the 5th of January, 1974), in what was his final game show. Shortly after completing voice-over work as Mr. Snoops for Walt Disney's 23rd animated feature, The Rescuers (released in 1977), 49-year-old Flynn was discovered by family members in the swimming pool of his Beverly Hills home, the victim of an apparent drowning accident on July 19, 1974.

History St. Michaels Cathedral in 1908 The parish was established in 1847 as the church of St. Benedict after years of local Catholics fighting Protestant opposition to establish a parish. The congregation purchased a former Baptist church which served as its first home. For the first five years, it had no pastor when the Rev. Michael P. Gallagher was assigned to serve the parish. Gallagher began construction of the current sanctuary on State Street in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1860, and completed in 1861, based on plans from noted Brooklyn architect Patrick Keely. In recognition of Fr. Gallagher's work, the parish changed its name to St. Michael at this time. Fr. Gallagher died in 1869 and is buried at the church entrance. When Pope Pius IX established the present Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts in 1870, St. Michael's church became its cathedral. The structure was expanded in 1996, with the addition of the Bishop Marshall Center at the rear of the church. The center includes a chapel that seats 60 people, a TV studio for the daily broadcast of the Mass, a parish hall that can seat 120 people and kitchen, and it is handicap accessible. From the year 2000, the cathedral has been home to The Cathedral Choir of Boys and Adults, whose purpose is to serve the bishop, sing at ordinations and other high masses, and perform the annual festival of Lessons and Carols and Tenebrae service during Advent and Lent, respectively. Along with their normal duties, the choir offers basic music theory training to the boys of the choir.

The municipal area comprises the incorporated villages of Gladau, Paplitz, Schopsdorf, and Tucheim. Genthin was the administrative seat of the Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (\\"collective municipality\\") Elbe-Stremme-Fiener until its merger into the newly established Jerichow municipality in 2010. History Genthin Castle was first mentioned in an 1144 deed, it was the residence of the Plotho noble family who then served as ministeriales of the Archbishops of Magdeburg. The surrounding settlement was documented as a town in 1459, its citizens were vested with market rights in 1539. When the last administrator of the Magdeburg archbishopric, Duke Augustus of Saxe- Weissenfels, died in 1680, Genthin with the Duchy of Magdeburg fell to the Electors of Brandenburg.

A detergent factory was opened in 1921 by Henkel. On the night of 21‚Äì22 December 1939, at least 186 (according to other sources: 278) people were killed in a train crash at Genthin station, making it one of the most deadliest railway accidents in Germany. A monument to the victims was erected in the town. In 1943 a subcamp of Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp was built in Genthin for about 1,000 female prisoners and forced labourers.

Description The genus of bees consists of generally small, black and yellow/white wasp-like species. The resemblance to wasps is enhanced by the absence of a scopa, which is atypical among bees. Hylaeus carry pollen in the crop, rather than externally, and regurgitate it into the cell where it will be used as larval food. Like most colletids, the liquid provisions are sealed inside a membranous cellophane-like cell lining. Nests are typically in dead twigs or plant stems, or other similarly small natural cavities, rather than constructing or excavating their own nests as in many other bees. Distribution and status A significant diversity of Hylaeus is found in Hawai'i ‚Äî approximately sixty species are recorded as living there. Hylaeus are the only bees considered native to the islands and most of those are unique to the island chain; the diversity of this genus is far greater in Hawai'i than in all of mainland North America. Many of them are species of concern, and some recorded there are possibly extinct. For example, H. finitimus was last collected 100 years ago, and only ever seen on the island of Kauai. The Hawaiian bee population and diversity is somewhat fluid ‚Äî within the past ten to twenty years several Hylaeus species have been found and identified on the islands as new to science. In October 2016, seven species were officially listed as endangered by U. S. Fish & Wildlife, the first bees to ever be placed on the endangered species list.

A standard \\"vach nacht\\" custom, practised by many Ashkenazi Jews, is to have children come and recite the Shema Yisrael and other verses from the Torah near the baby. In Hasidic communities a celebratory meal is held. Origins As described in Edut L'Yisrael: Sheiruta di'Tzlota (a text on customs surrounding weddings and births in Judaism, published in Israel c. 1960), the current practice appears to be a combination of two distinct customs. Firstly, as stressed in the Kabbalistic sources, the night before the circumcision is considered a spiritually dangerous time for the baby; as such, the father would gather ten men to conduct a vigil to study Torah to protect him from metaphysical damage. Thus, this night is given the Yiddish name, \\"night of watching [or 'guarding']\\". Secondly, non-Kabbalistic sources describe a practice several centuries old, that on the Friday night before the brit milah, a melamed would take his preschool-age students to say Shema near the baby, and afterwards receive candy (or their equivalent at that point in history, namely nuts or dried fruit).

On the bonangs, an imbal pattern is divided between the bonang panerus and bonang barung, in the octave or so of range that both instruments have. When played on sarons, generally two of the same instrument are used. Both bonang and saron patterns generally are made of scalar passages that end on the seleh at the end of the gatra. Each key is dampened as soon as the other instrument plays, and it allows the melody to be played faster or more smoothly than is possible by a single performer. \\"Basically, there are two bonang-playing techniques: imbal- imbalan and pipilan.

Life Gertner was born in Bƒôdzin, Poland, one of three children in a prosperous Jewish family. Before the German and Slovakia invasion of Poland, she attended the gymnasium in Bƒôdzin. The city was located in the industrial region of Zag≈Çƒôbie DƒÖbrowskie in south-western Poland on the border with Germany.Carrie-Anne (Nov. 22, 2006), Ala Gertner (Mar. 12, 1912, Poland - Jan. 5, 1945). Find A Grave Memorial #16748307. =Geppersdorf labour camp= The German military took over Bƒôdzin on the first day of the invasion, burned the Grand Synagogue down within a week, and began massive resettlement actions. On October 28, 1940 Gertner was ordered to report to the train station in nearby Sosnowiec, where she was taken to a Nazi labor camp in Geppersdorf (now Rzedziwojowice), a construction site where hundreds of Jewish men were used as forced laborers on the Reichsautobahn section (now Berlinka) and where women worked in the kitchen and laundry. Gertner, who was fluent in German, was assigned to the camp office, where she met prisoner Bernhard Holtz whom she would marry in the Bƒôdzin Ghetto in the following year. Geppersdorf was part of Organisation Schmelt, a network of 177 labor camps under the administration of Albrecht Schmelt, a World War I veteran who joined the Nazis in 1930 and rose quickly to the post of SS Oberf√ºhrer. Because of his familiarity with the local political and social conditions in the annexed region of western Poland, Schmelt was hand-picked by SS head Heinrich Himmler to be \\"Special Representative of the Reichsf√ºhrer SS for the Employment of Foreign Labor in Upper Silesia.\\" After his official appointment in October 1940, Schmelt set up headquarters in Sosnowiec and created a labor camp system that would become known as Organisation Schmelt. Schmelt built a highly lucrative slave trade. Over 50,000 Jews from western Poland were forced to work for German businesses, primarily in construction, munitions, and textile manufacturing. The businesses paid Schmelt, who shared a fraction of the money with Moses Merin, the Jewish governor of the region. Almost none of it went to the Jewish laborers. Conditions varied, but were much better than in the large concentration camps: for example, mail and packages could be received in some of the Schmelt camps until 1943, when the Schmelt labor camps became part of Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen. (Oskar Schindler's camp was originally under Organization Schmelt.) In 1941, Gertner was allowed to return home. She was employed in various local workshops and offices run by Moses Merin. She and Bernhard Holtz were married in the Sosnowiec Ghetto of ≈örodula on May 22, 1943. They lived in the Bƒôdzin Ghetto neighbourhood of Kamionka until sometime after July 16, 1943 (the date of Gertner's last known letter) and were probably deported to Auschwitz with the remaining Jews of Sosnowiec and Bƒôdzin in early August, 1943. =At Auschwitz= At Auschwitz, Gertner worked in the warehouses at first, sorting the possessions of Jews who had been gassed. She became friendly with Roza Robota, who was active in the underground resistance. Gertner was then assigned to the office of the munitions factory, where she and Roza became part of a conspiracy to smuggle gunpowder to the Sonderkommando, who were building bombs and planning an escape. Gertner recruited other women to join the conspiracy, and passed the stolen gunpowder to Roza. On October 7, 1944, the Sonderkommando blew up Crematorium IV, but the revolt was quickly quelled by the armed SS guards. A lengthy investigation led the Nazis back to Gertner and Roza, and then to Estusia Wajcblum and Regina Safirsztajn, who were also implicated in the conspiracy. They were interrogated and tortured for weeks. On January 5, 1945, the four women were publicly hanged in Auschwitz.Heilman, p. 143 Other sources give January 6 as the date of the execution. This was the last public hanging at Auschwitz: two weeks later, the camp was evacuated. Legacy Gertner left no known survivors or family, but her 28 letters to a camp friend, Sala Kirschner (n√©e Garncarz), also from the Sosnowiec Ghetto, are among the 350 wartime letters that are in the permanent Sala Garncarz Kirschner Collection of the Dorot Jewish Division of the New York Public Library.The New York Public Library Dorot Jewish Division, Ala Gertner‚Äôs letters to Sala. Introduction. The heroism of the four women was recognized in 1991 with the dedication of a memorial at Yad Vashem. This is the text of Gertner's last known letter: ::Kamionka ::July 15, 1943 ::Dearest Sarenka, ::Suddenly I‚Äôm here at the post office. The mail is going out today and how could I not write to my Sarenka? Just now, my husband, little Bernhard was here. He looks good and feels well. I‚Äôm curious about how you are, how your health is.

He was known for his fringed buckskin jacket. He became famous in Tombstone, Arizona, for killing two men in self-defense. He married the widow of one of his victims eight days after killing her husband. Following their divorce, Leslie later shot and killed a woman he lived with at his ranch while drunk and in a fit of jealousy. He was sentenced to life in prison, but only served six years before he was pardoned. He was last listed in the U.S. Federal Census on January 27, 1920 in Sausalito, California. No public records of him have been found after this date and it is not known when he died.  Early life  =Born in Texas= Leslie was born Nashville Franklyn Leslie near San Antonio, Texas. Conflicting accounts of his early life exist. In 1913, Leslie wrote on his marriage certificate that he was the son of Bernard Leslie from Virginia, and Martha Leslie of Kentucky.California State Board of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics.

National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C The Tombstone Daily Prospector reported on July 15, 1889, that Leslie was born in Galveston, Texas in 1842 where he supposedly grew up. They stated that his father was Thomas Kennedy and his mother was Martha Leslie. The story reports that he took his mother's last name as his after a falling out with his father, though they did not provide any sources. =Imaginative personal history= Nothing has been documented concerning Leslie's first 36 years, although he told some colorful and improbable stories concerning those missing years. On two separate occasions Leslie told writers his version of incidents from his early life. In 1880, Leslie said that \\"in 1861 I joined the Southern Army, and continued with it till April 9th 1865, when I was attached to General Gordon's division as a First Lieutenant, in the 10th Cavalry.\\" He claimed he \\"was Deputy Sheriff of Abalene... under the notorious J.B.

Born in Virginia [sic] in 1842 of a good family he went to Heidelberg to study medicine, his brother at the same time going to West Point for a military education. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Frank returned to his old home in Virginia [sic] and entered the Confederate Army as a bugler, while his brother joined the Union forces.San Francisco Chronicle, December 2, 1893 Leslie also claimed that he served as a scout for the U.S. Army in Texas, Oklahoma and the Dakotas during the 1870s, but no documentation has been found.Rickards, Colin. Buckskin Frank Leslie: Gunman of Tombstone, El Paso: Texas Western Press, 1964, p. 3  San Francisco  Leslie was first recorded in San Francisco in 1878, where he was employed as a barkeeper in Thomas Boland's saloon at 311 Pine Street. He lived in San Francisco at 732 Howard Street.1878 San Francisco City Directory, p. 515 In 1879 he was a \\"bookkeeper,\\" which may have been a typo for \\"barkeeper,\\" since he worked at Kerr & Jurado's Saloon & Billiard Room.1879 San Francisco City Directory, p. 527 The next year he was again listed as a barkeeper in the same establishment and was living at 746 Folsom Street.1880 San Francisco City Directory, p.546 In mid-1880, he moved to Tombstone, Arizona.  Tombstone, Arizona  Leslie arrived in Tombstone, in July 1880 dressed in the buckskin attire of a scout.Arizona Quarterly Illustrated, July 1880, p. 11 He was tall and weighed about . When he arrived in Tombstone, he traded in his frontier clothing for gentleman's attire like that worn in San Francisco. He complimented his city dress with a fringed buckskin vest that furthered his reputation as \\"Buckskin Frank\\" Leslie. In Tombstone, he partnered with William H. Knapp, and opened the Cosmopolitan Saloon next door to the Cosmopolitan Hotel at 409 Allen Street.DeMattos, Buckskin Frank Leslie Revealed, p. 6 = Kills Mike Killeen = Leslie was attracted to a chambermaid at the Cosmopolitan Hotel named Mary Jane \\"May\\" Killeen. He attended her wedding to Mike Killeen on April 13, 1880, in Tombstone, and was one of two witness listed on the marriage record.Certification by Rev. J.V. McIntyre, dated May 15, 1880, that he married Mary Jane Evans and Michael Killeen, who were both from Virginia City, Nevada, at Tombstone on April 13, 1880. The handwritten document is in the collections of the Arizona State Library, Archives & Public Records, Phoenix, AZ. Mike Killeen was jealous of the relationship between May and Leslie.May Killeen was born Mary Jane Evans in Kentucky on May 25, 1856. Michael D. \\"Mike\\" Killeen was born in Illinois in 1848. Killeen was then employed as a bartender at Lowry and Archer's Saloon in Tombstone. DeMattos, Buckskin Frank Leslie Revealed, p. 19 Late in the evening of June 22, 1880, Leslie had his arm around May as they sat on the front porch of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. George M. Perine, a friend of Leslie, saw her husband approaching, and warned Leslie, but not before Killeen fired his gun twice. The bullets grazed Leslie's head, and stunned him. Killeen attacked Leslie, and began clubbing him with his revolver when Killeen was shot, and mortally wounded. Before he died five days later, on June 28, he told E.T. Packwood that Perine had shot him. Both Leslie and Perine were charged with murder, but Leslie claimed he had fired in self-defense, and that Perine had not fired his weapon. The court accepted Leslie's explanation, and dismissed charges against both men.DeMattos, Buckskin Frank Leslie Revealed, pp. 6-7 and 19 = Marries Mary Killeen = Eight days after her husband's death, Mary Killeen married Leslie. For the second time, within 84 days, 13 year-old Louisa E.

Records of the Justice's Court of James Reilly, Cochise County Recorder's Office, Bisbee, Arizona The Tombstone Epitaph reported: = Confronts James Young = James Young had two encounters with Buckskin Frank Leslie, and Leslie backed down both times. Young was an early arrival in Tombstone, Arizona, and had worked in the Contention mine, and staked a claim nearby. When he found that Leslie had jumped his claim, Young approached him with a shotgun, and beckoned him to go back to town quickly. Leslie shrugged it off, and explained that he had heard that some others were about to jump Young's claim, and he had gone there to help him stand them off. When the news about the stand-off went around town, James Young's prestige rose, and Frank Leslie's faltered some. Later, when Leslie met Young in a store, unarmed and with his back turned, Leslie pulled his gun out of its holster, and was about to use it. The woman store-owner screamed and jumped between the two men. Again, Buckskin shrugged it off, and said he was just checking his six-gun to see that it was in good working order. = Kills Billy Claiborne = A major fire swept Tombstone on May 26, 1882, which destroyed Knapp & Leslie's Cosmopolitan Saloon. The partners decided against rebuilding, and Leslie took a job tending bar at the Oriental Saloon, one of the few buildings still standing. Leslie was tending bar at the Oriental on November 14, 1882, when Billy Claiborne, who was very drunk, began using insulting and abusive language. Leslie asked Claiborne to leave, but Claiborne continued his foul and abusive speech. Leslie grabbed Claiborne by his coat collar, and escorted him out. Leslie later testified, \\"He used very hard language, and as he started away from me, shook a finger at me and said, 'That's all right Leslie, I'll get even on you.' \\"Tombstone Epitaph, Saturday, November 18, 1882 Within a few minutes, two men told Leslie there was a man waiting outside to shoot him. When Leslie stepped outside, he saw \\"a foot of rifle barrel protruding from the end of the fruit stand.\\" He tried to talk Claiborne out of shooting, but Claiborne raised his rifle, and fired the weapon, missing Leslie. Leslie returned fire, hitting Claiborne in the chest. \\"I saw him double up and had my pistol cocked and aimed at him again... I advanced upon him, but did not shoot, when he said, 'Don't shoot again, I am killed.' \\" Leslie had planned that day to travel to the Dragoon Mountains with George W. Parsons, but the trip was cancelled. Parsons described Claiborne's death, writing that \\"Frank didn't lose the light of his cigarette during the encounter. Wonderfully cool man.\\"Diary entry, George W. Parsons. November 14, 1882. Arizona Historical Society The coroner's inquest concluded that Leslie shot Claiborne in self- defense, which \\"in the opinion of the jury, was justifiable.\\" =The Magnolia Ranch= At the end of 1882, Milton E. Joyce sold his share in the Oriental Saloon, and he and Leslie partnered to build a ranch near Arizona's Swisshelm Mountains. The \\"Magnolia\\" was located from Tombstone in a very desolate section of southeastern Arizona. Milt Joyce sold Leslie his share of the ranch in 1885.According to his obituary in the Dec. 2, 1889, San Francisco Bulletin, Milton E. Joyce was born in Missouri during 1847, and died in San Francisco on November 29, 1889. His partner, James W. Orndorff, was born in Ohio on April 7, 1834, and died in San Francisco on February 16, 1923 = Becomes cavalry scout = From May 20 to June 21, 1885, Leslie became a scout for the 4th Cavalry. In 1886, he applied for a job as a customs inspector, and continued some work as a scout.Register of Customs Employees at Small Ports, Vol. 4, No. 6, March 10, 1886. Application for Employment from Nashville Franklyn Leslie to Collector of Customs Joseph Magoffin. National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C In the April, 1886 the San Francisco Chronicle reported: = Divorce = Mary Jane \\"May\\" Leslie filed a divorce complaint, and alleged that Leslie had had sex with \\"Miss Birdie Woods\\" between July 4‚Äì6, 1886. On May 17, 1886, the Daily Tombstone reported that \\"the Crystal Palace has secured the services of Miss Birdie Woods of San Francisco, who will make her first appearance this evening as a vocal and instrumental musician.\\" She also charged that Leslie had choked and beaten her on March 9, 1887. The divorce was granted on June 3, 1887. Judge William H. Barnes ordered Leslie to pay her $650 in cash and to convey title to a one-fourth interest in the Magnolia Ranch, including 13 horses and 150 cattle. Leslie was also ordered to pay all legal fees.Mary Jane \\"May\\" Evans Killeen Leslie married a third husband, Alexander Durward (1854-1922), in Tombstone, on October 12, 1889. She died in Banning, California, on March 27, 1947, at the age of ninetyCrude Frontier Drama Told Before Probate Court When Cockburn Hearing Is Opened San Bernardino Sun Volume 59, Number 98, 7 December 1926. She was mentioned as a witness in December 1926. = Murders Mollie Edwards = After his divorce, Mollie Edwards joined Leslie at his ranch as his \\"wife,\\"Mollie Edwards was most likely her real name. Other contemporary newspaper accounts identified her as \\"Mollie Williams.\\" She was also known as \\"Mollie Bradshaw,\\" when she was living in Tombstone with a man named Bradshaw but that relationship ended on July 10, 1889 when Leslie returned to his ranch drunk. He found Mollie Edwards sitting and talking with James Neil. The Tombstone Daily Epitaph reported: Neil was badly wounded, and was brought back to Tombstone where he was treated by Dr. George E. Goodfellow on July 12, 1889, one of the foremost surgeons in treating gunshot wounds in the United States. Leslie was arrested the same day, and jailed.Arizona Weekly Citizen (Tucson), July 20, 1889 After a two-day preliminary hearing, Leslie was ordered held without bail until his trial in Tucson. Four days after killing Edwards, the coroner's jury reported: Leslie plead guilty \\"to murder in the first degree\\" on January 6, 1890. The Sacramento Daily Record-Union reported: = Sentenced to life = Leslie was sentenced to life in prison. Sheriff John Slaughter delivered him to the Yuma Territorial Prison on January 9, 1890, where he became convict number 632. The Mohave Miner, on January 18, 1890, reported \\"The eleven convicts who were brought here from Tombstone yesterday, arrived in an intoxicated condition. One of the number, a life prisoner, Frank Leslie, was so drunk that he could scarcely walk.\\" Leslie was in prison less than three months when he joined five other convicts in an unsuccessful escape attempt.Arizona Daily Citizen (Tucson), March 31, 1890 Leslie was sent to solitary for his part in the escape attempt. When he was released from solitary, he became a model prisoner, and worked as a pharmacist in the prison infirmary. W.H. Cameron, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, interviewed Leslie in late 1893. =Pardoned by Arizona Governor= After reading the story in the San Francisco Chronicle, a 36-year-old San Francisco divorcee named Belle Stowell began writing Leslie. The Tombstone Prospector (June 29, 1896) reported \\"It is probable that Frank Leslie, who was sentenced from this county to Yuma for life for murder, is likely soon to be a free man, as the Gazette states that executive clemency is likely to be extended in his behalf by Gov. Franklin\\" On November 17, 1896, Governor Benjamin J. Franklin of the Territory of Arizona granted Leslie a full and unconditional pardon.Proclamation of Pardon, November 17, 1896. Governor Benjamin J. Franklin Papers, Arizona Department of Archives, Phoenix Leslie quickly left the state, going to Los Angeles, where he checked into the Natick House.Arizona Republican, November 24, 1896.  Later life  = Marries Belle Stowell = Leslie later took a train to Stockton, California, and on December 1, 1896, Belle Stowell, went to the San Joaquin County Clerk's office, and obtained a marriage license. Leslie identified himself as \\"Nashville Franklyn Leslie, native of Virginia [sic], age 55,\\" and stated that he was a \\"resident of San Carlos, Territory of Arizona.\\" His bride described herself as \\"Mrs. Belle Stowell, native of Warren County, Illinois, age 39, resident of Warren Co., Illinois.\\" Leslie once again spelled his middle name as \\"Franklyn,\\" rather than \\"Franklin\\" on his marriage license. He also repeated his false claim of a Virginia birth on the form, as he had in the San Francisco Chronicle profile of December 2, 1893. Most likely he repeated it on the license for the benefit of his bride, who first became aware of Leslie because of that San Francisco Chronicle article, and may have found a Virginia birth part of his appeal The Stockton Daily Independent reported that \\"their wedding trip was to be to China, the start to be made by the next steamer,\\"Stockton Daily Independent, Wednesday, December 2, 1896 but, they never made it to China. Four months later, the San Francisco Call, reported that \\"Mrs. Leslie is at present in this state, but it is said that her husband cannot be located... It is not known whether they have separated or not, but it is believed that they have.\\"San Francisco Call, Wednesday, April 28, 1897 The marriage was not legally ended until March 19, 1903, when it was reported Belle was granted the divorce from \\"Leslie for failure to provide.\\"San Francisco Call, March 19, 1903 = Fort Worth = In April 1897, Leslie arrived in Fort Worth, where he joined an Arizona friend named John Ralph \\"Jack\\" Dean. Leslie worked for Dean as a bartender in the Delaware Cafe. On January 17, 1898, the newspaper reported that he and a group of men formed \\"the charter of the Copper River Gold Mining and Prospect Company of Fort Worth was sent to Austin in charge of F.A. Mason, Capt. N.F. Leslie and Silas L. King today. This is the company which has been formed there to prospect in the Alaskan gold fields.\\"Dallas Morning News, Tuesday, January 18, 1898 Leslie apparently never went to Alaska, for in early April 1898 he was in Mexico. He was reported to be with \\"Doctor George Goodfellow and Tom Selby of San Francisco, at Hermosillo preparing for a trip to the interior.\\"Florence Tribune [Florence, Arizona], April 2, 1898 = Possible service in Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War = Leslie apparently didn't stay in Mexico long. He claimed that he enlisted, fought, and was wounded in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The San Francisco Call later published a lengthy story written by Leslie in which he claimed that \\"when Roosevelt commenced his recruitment I enlisted in one of the first companies formed in Arizona, and after arriving in Cuba was transferred by my own request to Lawtons's command and remained with him until the end of Spain's dominion in the western hemisphere. At the end of the War I returned to Arizona.\\"San Francisco Call, Sunday, January 7, 1900.The full page article was headlined, \\"Personal Experiences With the Late General Lawton Told by Captain N. Frank Leslie, His Chief of Scouts in the Apache Campaign.\\" = Mining in Mexico = If Leslie actually served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he then traveled to Tombstone early in August, 1898, serving as a guide for a geological survey party looking for coal deposits. An Arizona paper reported that \\"since leaving Arizona Leslie has been in Cuba and returned wounded. After recovery he joined this surveying party and it is expected they will be engaged hereabouts for several months.\\"Arizona Republican (Phoenix, Arizona), August 10, 1898 The geological survey party was led by Professor Edwin Theodore Dumble. According to one Arizona newspaper \\"Prof. Dumble and his right hand man, Capt. Frank Leslie, have been in Nogales several days making arrangements for a month's stay in the field.\\"The Border Vidette (Nogales, Arizona), December 1, 1898 Leslie was in the vicinity of Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico, during the late summer of 1899 when he had a close call. According to one report, \\"Captain Frank Leslie, well known all over Arizona, was held up by Yaquis and robbed. They took all his arms, mount etc., and turned him loose.\\"The Oasis (Nogales, Arizona), September 2, 1899 Leslie briefly returned to San Francisco, but in 1900, he went to Mexico to work for the Mulatos Mining Company.The Oasis (Nogales, Arizona), Saturday, January 19, 1901 Leslie wrote about the mining company's activities for a Nogales newspaper on March 14, 1902.The Oasis (Nogales, Arizona) Saturday, March 15, 1902 = Return to San Francisco = Leslie was one of four well-dressed men, along with Harry Walters, T. Estrau and T.E. Gaitwere, who in November 1900, attempted to fleece J.P. Reynolds, a Nevada mining-man. The would-be victim sensed that the men were trying to defraud him, and got away before losing any money. \\"As Reynolds did not suffer from his experience with the bunko men, the officers were unable to hold them on any other charge except vagrancy.\\" Leslie and the other men were arrested and charged with vagrancy at the city prison.San Francisco Call, MINER FOILS BUNKO MEN - Four Sharpers behind Bars at Hall of Justice. November 3, 1900 In another incident in December 1902, Leslie asked George V. Fause of Humboldt County for directions to a park in San Francisco. He befriended Fause and led him to a room in a lodging house on the southwest corner of Bush and Kearney Street, where Leslie and other men got Fause to give them a check for $675, which they promptly cashed at the Anglo-California Bank. When Fause left the place he ran into two policeman and told them of the fraud. The officers went back to the house as one of the men came out the front door. \\"When he saw the officers he started to run, but was soon overtaken and conveyed to the City Prison. He gave his name as Frank Leslie and his occupation as a horseman. Leslie was booked on a charge of grand Larceny by trick and device.\\"San Francisco Call, Dec 17, 1902 BUNKO MEN DUPE TWO STRANGERS, George V. Fause On November 25, 1902, Leslie was in San Francisco when his pistol fell out of his pocket, discharged, and wounded him. According to the San Francisco Chronicle: =Homestead claim filed in Seattle= On March 13, 1913, while living in Seattle, Leslie filed a homestead for property on Orcas Island. The homestead was contested a year later as Leslie \\"failed to reside, or attempted to cultivate the land.\\" Leslie had boarded with John Dean and his wife.

During the 1880s, there was also a photograph taken in a studio setting by a photographer, that depicts a well-dressed Frank Leslie. In December 2017, a previously unpublished photograph of Buckskin Frank Leslie was discovered, which depicts Leslie circa 1915, when he was in his seventies, and wearing his famous buckskin jacket. In that photograph, Frank Leslie was no longer sporting his sweeping moustache. The back of the photograph was inscribed \\"Nashville Frank Leslie\\". Television portrayal The actor Anthony Caruso played Leslie in the 1958 episode, \\"The Gunsmith,\\" of the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Robert Fuller, prior to Laramie, was cast as gunsmith Alex. In the story line, Leslie comes to town to see his old flame Mary (Anita Gordon), Alex's fianc√© who wants nothing to do with Leslie.

Cyganek was born in Wirek, a district of the Upper Silesian city of Ruda ≈ölƒÖska. From early childhood he loved soccer and was a very fast runner, so at age 14 he became a forward on the local team Wawel Wirek. In the 1930s Wawel played in Silesian A-Class, the strongest regional league in Poland (in interwar Poland, A-Class was equivalent of today‚Äôs Second Division). Cyganek was widely regarded as too good for this division and several top teams of the Polish Soccer League wanted to buy him. Among these were ≈ölƒÖsk ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice, Ruch Chorz√≥w and Cracovia. Their offers were refused, but finally, at the beginning of 1939, he decided to move to Fablok Chrzan√≥w, another A-Class team, from the Krak√≥w region. In 1939 his team won Krak√≥w‚Äôs qualifiers, which allowed it to play in inter-regional games for promotion to the Polish Soccer Division. On the way, however, Fablok lost to ≈ölƒÖsk ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice. Cyganek, who was making good money with Fablok, was feeling good there, improving his play virtually every day. After a Krak√≥w - Upper Silesia 4-1 game (mid-1939) his class was noticed by J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa, who called him to the National Team. Lone game for the Polish National Team On August 27, 1939 in Warsaw Poland faced Hungary. Cyganek was among the starters, sidelining Gerard Wodarz, one of the best left wingers in Poland. The game vs. Hungary was a big success for the Poles, as they beat the 1938 World Cup runners-up 4-2. Apart from Ernest Wilimowski, Leonard PiƒÖtek and Ewald Dytko, Cyganek, a debutant, was regarded as the best player on the field. Chrzan√≥w‚Äôs player was hoping for more such games and looking forward to the 1940 Olympic Games in Tokyo, but his plans were brutally thwarted on September 1, as with the German attack on Poland, World War II began. German occupation In late fall of 1939 Germans decided to reopen soccer games in occupied Upper Silesia. Cyganek, who in the meantime had returned to Wirek, started playing for the German-sponsored team Winter Sport-Verein Antonienhutte (formerly Wawel Wirek). He supposedly lost none of his class, as was noticed by Sepp Herberger, manager of German National Team. However, the player was soon kicked out by Herberger, because he continued to speak Polish. End of career In early 1945, after the Red Army poured into Upper Silesia, Cyganek started to organize soccer games under new, Communist authorities. Soon afterwards Fablok‚Äôs officials got in touch with him, so he returned to Chrzan√≥w. He spent several years there, finishing his career in 1955 as a defender of Otmƒôt Krapkowice. Afterwards, he became a coach of several teams such as Pogo≈Ñ Zabrze, Urania Ruda ≈ölƒÖska and Wawel Wirek. Cyganek died in 1995 in Wirek.

The Chinatown mission at 10 Mott Street where Sigel volunteered, viewed from the balcony of the Port Arthur Restaurant. Sigel, who had been a missionary in Chinatown, was found strangled inside a trunk on 18 June 1909 in the apartment of the prime suspect, a Chinese man named \\"William\\" Leon Ling, a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. Sigel had been missing since June 9, when she was last seen leaving her parents' apartment to visit her grandmother. Background Sigel's body was found on the top floor of 782 8th Avenue. Sigel's mother taught a Chinese Sunday school class in St. Andrew's Church at 127th Street and Fifth Avenue, while Sigel did missionary work at the Chinatown Rescue Settlement and Recreation Room, reaching out to \\"American, English, German, French, Hebrew, Italian, [and] Bohemian\\" girls who had gotten involved with drugs and prostitution. Four years prior to the murder, Leon had kept a chop suey restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue, close to the Sigel home, and Sigel and her mother had first met Leon there during missionary rounds of the local Chinese restaurants. Investigation During the murder investigation, 35 love letters signed by Sigel were found in Leon's apartment, along with numerous letters from other women. It was speculated that the motive for murder might have been jealousy, as Chu Gain, manager of the Port Arthur Restaurant on Mott Street, was also found to be in possession of recent love letters from Sigel. Chu reported that he had recently received an anonymous letter threatening Sigel's life if they did not cut off their relationship. Leon was never apprehended, and the murder remains unsolved. Aftermath Sigel's murder gained widespread notoriety due to the inter-racial aspects of the relationship as well as the fame of her grandfather, Franz Sigel, who was a U.S. Civil War general. The murder set off a wave of anti-Chinese hysteria, as well as suggestions that the murder was Sigel's own fault.

He was also a member of the United States House of Representatives from Florida, following the reconstruction era; the mayor of Memphis, Tennessee; an volunteer officer in the United States Army during the Second Seminole War; a member of the Arkansas Senate; a member of the Florida Senate; and a Circuit Court Judge in Florida. Early life (1812 to 1852) Finley was born near Lebanon, Tennessee. He served as captain of mounted volunteers in the Second Seminole War in 1836. Finley studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1838. He moved to Mississippi County, Arkansas in 1840, where he practiced law. Finley served in the Arkansas Senate in 1841. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1842, and continued the practice of law. He served as mayor of Memphis in 1845. He moved to Marianna, Florida in November 1846 and was elected to the Florida Senate in 1850. Finley was a presidential elector on the Whig Party ticket in 1852. Judicial Service to the State of Florida (1853 to 1861) On May 1, 1853, Florida Governor Thomas Brown appointed Finley Circuit Judge of the Western Judicial Circuit of Florida.Hardy Finley served as a Circuit Judge of the Western Judicial Circuit of Florida from 1853 to 1861. = State of Florida v. Simon, A Slave = In June 1853, Finley presided over State of Florida v. Simon, A Slave.Hardy The Collins Hotel in Pensacola, Florida burned on October 17, 1852; the Collins fire spread to the home of Francisco Moreno. On October 18, Dr. R.T. Maxwell's home burned, and an alleged arson attempt was made to the home of a Mrs. Derry, from which a perpetrator was discovered and fled. On October 19, Alex McVoy's home burned. After the McVoy fire, Pensacola Mayor Joseph Sierra ordered the arrest of Simon, one of McVoy's slaves, for arson. Sierra questioned Simon in the Mayor's office; took Simon's confession to arson of the Maxwell, Derry, and McVoy homes; and ordered Simon arrested. Simon was held in the Pensacola jail from October 1852 until trial in June 1853. Sierra testified at the June trial that during Simon‚Äôs interrogation \\"there was a great crowd just outside the mayor‚Äôs office calling for Simon to be hanged. According to Mayor Sierra, if not for the protection he gave Simon, 'the people would have taken [Simon] into their own hands.' The mayor told Simon that if he admitted that he alone had burned Dr. Maxwell‚Äôs house, that he would be tried and certainly hung. However, the mayor also told Simon that if he had accomplices, he could turn state‚Äôs evidence and his accomplices would be put on trial rather than him.\\"Hardy Sierra further testified that when he asked Simon if he set these fires, \\"Simon replied, 'Send for my master, and I will tell the whole.' Simon‚Äôs master, Alex McVoy, arrived at the mayor‚Äôs office, and McVoy reiterated to Simon the warnings and promises that the mayor had already made. Simon then stated that he had set fire to Dr. Maxwell‚Äôs house, and that he was alone when he did it. Simon told Mayor Sierra and McVoy that he had started the fire at a ground-floor window on the east side of Dr. Maxwell‚Äôs house and remained there until it was blazing.\\"Hardy Simon‚Äôs attorney Richard Lewis Campbell questioned Mr. Joseph Commyns, who \\"testified that he saw Dr. Maxwell‚Äôs house on fire at about 2 a.m. and that he was one of the first persons to arrive on scene. Commyns contradicted Simon‚Äôs purported confession. According to Commyns, the fire did not start at the ground floor of the house as Simon had stated, but rather at the shingles on the roof.\\"Hardy Campbell also questioned Chester Knapp, who \\"contradicted Simon‚Äôs purported confession. According to Knapp, the fire had not started on the ground floor, but rather in the attic. Further, Knapp testified that upon seeing the attic in flames, he had tried to break down the front door of the home, and that had the ground floor windows been burning, he would have noticed.\\"Hardy Following Campbell's examination of Commyns and Knapp, the State questioned McVoy, \\"who testified that he was in the mayor‚Äôs office when Simon confessed and that Simon was 'laboring under great terror, and that he never saw anyone more terrified.'\\"Hardy Citing American and English common law, Campbell motioned that Finley \\"exclude Simon‚Äôs confession from the jury‚Äôs consideration, arguing that Simon‚Äôs statements to Mayor Sierra were elicited by undue terror or the hope of reward.\\"Hardy Finley denied Campbell‚Äôs motion and directed the jury \\"to determine whether Simon‚Äôs confession was voluntary.\\"Hardy The jury found Simon guilty. Simon stated at a sentencing hearing that he was not guilty of arson. Finley then ordered Simon executed by hanging on Friday, August 26, 1853, between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. by the Sheriff of Escambia County at ‚Äúsome convenient place.‚ÄùHardy Campbell appealed Finley's denial of Campbell's motion to the Supreme Court of Florida.Hardy The Court heard oral arguments on July 13 and 14, 1853. On July 25, 1853, with Finley present, the Court reversed Finley's denial of Campbell's motion in a 2 to 1 ruling, and ordered a new trial. The Court based their decision \\"on the common law doctrine that for a confession to be admissible as evidence, the mind of the accused should at the time of the confession be uninfluenced by fear or hope. With respect to Simon‚Äôs confession, Justice [Albert G.] Semmes noted that there were 'few cases to be found in the books where stronger influences were brought to bear on the mind of the prisoner to extort a confession than the one before us. That it was made under the influence of fear or apprehension of personal violence, can scarce be doubted.' Justice Semmes noted that the crowd outside the mayor‚Äôs office was clamoring to hang Simon, and Mayor Sierra, who was Simon‚Äôs only protection from the crowd, was demanding that Simon confess. Justice Semmes reasoned that if Simon maintained his innocence, he risked alienating Mayor Sierra, which could have resulted in the mayor abandoning him to the crowd. Justice Semmes speculated that in Simon‚Äôs mind, a confession was 'the only immediate security for his person and his life.' Justice Semmes also focused on the fact that Simon was a slave, and that Simon made his confession in the presence of, and at the urging of, his master. According to Justice Semmes, 'the ease with which this class of our population can be intimidated, and the almost absolute control which the owner does involuntarily exercise over the will of the slave, should induce the courts at all times to receive their confessions with the utmost caution and distrust.' Further, Justice Semmes opined that the trial testimony proved that Simon had falsely confessed. Specifically, Justice Semmes noted that when Simon admitted to the burning of Dr. Maxwell‚Äôs house, he claimed to have set the fire at the east window on the first floor of the home, and that he had stayed there watching the fire until it blazed up. However, the two defense witnesses who testified at trial stated that the fire had started at the top of the house in the attic. One of these witnesses testified that, as the attic burned, he was located near the ground floor east window where Simon had confessed to starting the fire, but there was no fire there. According to Justice Semmes, '[T]hese witnesses, who are unimpeached, and whose testimony is uncontradicted, establish the fact, that the confessions of the prisoner as to the particulars of the burning were altogether untrue.' As Justice Semmes reasoned, if Simon had been truthfully confessing to arson, he would have had no reason to lie about the location where he had started the fire.\\"Hardy Hardy stated that \\"without [Simon's] coerced confession, it did not appear there was any evidence to convict him.\\"Hardy Simon was to be held in the Pensacola jail until the second trial. Finley cancelled the October 1853 Escambia County Circuit Court term due to a Yellow Fever epidemic. Simon‚Äôs second trial was postponed until the next Escambia County Circuit Court term, in June 1854. Simon died in the Pensacola jail on February 25, 1854. The Florida Supreme Court's 1853 reversal of Finley's decision established a precedent that confessions extracted by threats or promises are inadmissible at trial.Hardy = End of Pre- Civil War Judicial Service to the State of Florida = With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Finley left service to the Western Judicial Circuit of Florida. Service to the Confederate States of America (1861 to 1865) = Judicial Service = Finley was appointed judge of the Confederate States court for the district of Florida in 1861. He resigned in March 1862 to join the Confederate Army. = Military Service = Finley volunteered as a private in the 6th Florida Infantry of the Confederate Army, and was successively promoted to be the colonel of the regiment. He took part in the Kentucky Campaign in Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith's column. His first significant combat came at the Battle of Chickamauga, where his regiment captured a battery of Union artillery, but was unsupported and forced to withdraw with 165 casualties. He was promoted to brigadier general on November 8, 1863 (with date of rank of November 16), commanding all of the Florida infantry in the Army of Tennessee. Finley's Brigade, part of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge's division, was caught up in the Confederate rout at the Battle of Missionary Ridge, but performed well in protecting the rearguard of the army as it withdrew. Army commander Gen. Braxton Bragg expressed his thanks to Finley for \\"his gallant bearing and prompt assistance in every emergency.\\" Finley's brigade saw heavy fighting in the Atlanta Campaign of 1864. He was badly wounded at Battle of Resaca and placed on medical leave until the army reached Atlanta. At the Battle of Jonesborough, his horse was killed by artillery shell fragments, which severely wounded him again, but he refused to be evacuated to Atlanta until all of his wounded men had been taken care of. Finley was unable to return to his brigade for the remainder of the war. He tried to reach it in North Carolina after he recovered from a second wound, but Federal troops blocked his way. = Military Surrender = Finley surrendered with Maj. Gen. Howell Cobb in Columbus, Georgia, and was paroled to Quincy, Florida on May 23, 1865.Eicher, p. 235; Jones, pp. 129-30. Congressional Service to the United States of America (1876 to 1882) Finley served in the United States House of Representatives during the 44th, 45th, and 47th United States Congress as a member of the Democratic Party (United States). Finley successfully contested the election of Josiah T. Walls to the 44th United States Congress. Finley served in the from April 19, 1876, to March 3, 1877. Finley successfully contested the election of Horatio Bisbee, Jr. to the 45th United States Congress and served from February 20 to March 3, 1879. He presented credentials as a Member-elect to the 47th United States Congress and served from March 4, 1881, to June 1, 1882, when he was succeeded by Horatio Bisbee, Jr., who successfully contested Finley's election. Finley presented credentials on December 5, 1887, as a Senator-designate to the United States Senate for the term commencing March 4, 1887, but was not permitted to qualify because the appointment was made before the vacancy occurred. = Electoral history = Death (1904) Finley died on November 6, 1904 in Lake City, Florida. He was interred to Evergreen Cemetery in Gainesville, Florida. Legacy In the 1930s, the School Board of Alachua County (Florida) named an elementary school for Finley.https://www.sbac.edu/domain/3517 JJ Finley Elementary School was located in Gainesville, Florida at the corner of Northwest 5th Avenue and 19th Street, about 1 kilometer north of the University of Florida. On June 16, 2020, the School Board of Alachua County (Florida) removed J.J. Finley's name from the school, during protests associated with the murder of George Floyd. The School Board will convene a citizen committee to recommend a new name by August 2020. In January 2019, the Gainesville City Commission named a city park in honor of Finley.https://gainesville.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3785896&GUID;=6080473C-E3DD-4C3A-BE09-F871D7077CDD The vote to name the park for Finley was unanimous. In February 2020, the City of Gainesville City Commission removed Finley's name from the park, by a unanimous vote. The City process to approve a new name required input from a citizen advisory board. The City suspended advisory board activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The park remained unnamed through the pandemic.

A show choir (originally known as a \\"swing choir\\") is a performance group combining choral singing with choreographed movement or dance, sometimes adding a thematic element to the show. It is most prevalent in the Midwestern United States, and was popularized by the American television show Glee. Location Show choir is primarily performed as a school activity in the United States. It is usually done as a co-curricular (as part of a class, as well as outside of the school day) or an extracurricular (completely outside of the school day) activity. In addition, some show choirs are formed in organizations outside of school. Though usually a high school activity, it has been taken up at all levels of school from elementary through the college/university level. Outside of the United States, show choirs can be found in other countries, including Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Ireland, Philippines, and Argentina. Counties in the United States with at least one Show Choir program. Relative positions of every past and present registered high school with at least one show choir in the United States (excluding Hawaii) as of November, 2015 (courtesy showchoir.com). Overview While there is no standard requirement for the number of performers, show choirs typically consist of 30 to 60 singer/dancers. Factors like the size of the school or even director preferences can impact the number. Larger schools with more advanced programs may have more than one show choir. Show choirs composed entirely of students of one gender usually compete in separate divisions from mixed-gender show choirs, with the exception of \\"open\\" divisions, where groups of different types compete against each other. Show choirs traditionally wear a costume, though the definition of what is considered a costume in show choir is very broad and ranges from jeans and a T-shirt to extravagant period costumes or flashy dancewear. Costumes can be conservative (such as tuxedos and ball gowns) or edgy (such as modern or revealing clothing). Additionally, many larger show choirs include two or more costumes in their show. Participants typically wear stage makeup and shoes conducive to dancing (often \\"character shoes\\"). Uniformity in look among performers is also common; there is generally consistency in costuming and makeup from person to person. In some regions this consistency even extends to things like hair, where female participants will all style their hair in an identical way. The choir usually has a backup band (\\"jazz\\" or \\"combo\\" if it includes a horn section) providing instrumental music to complement the voices. Instrumentation varies from song to song and choir to choir, but a common show choir band consists of guitar, bass, drums, trumpets, trombone, alto sax, tenor sax, piano, and synthesizer. Some bands include violins or even cellos. Many larger show choirs typically have a larger combo to accompany them. The band is usually not visually featured, however occasionally a show will bring out members of the band onstage at certain points. A \\"tech crew\\" or \\"stage crew\\" is standard with most show choirs, as they assist with and handle the lighting, sound, and stage setup. Show choir crew may also help in the management of costumes. During a show, the crew may have a great number of responsibilities including helping performers change costumes, manage props, hand out microphones, run special effects, and other duties set out in the design of the show. Due to a stigma that the performing arts is a more feminine activity, many teenage boys are not attracted to participating in show choir. However, in order to achieve a full choral sound with rich melodies and tonal variety, show choirs need males of all ranges including tenor and bass. One study done by the Choral Journal claimed that many choir directors are simply resigned to having fewer males in their choir, but should make an effort to change. . By reaching out to males and creating a more supportive community for high school boys, the hope is that more males will participate in show choir. Some participants consider show choir is a sport due to its dancing aspect; in West Virginia and Illinois it is currently pending as a physical education credit. Some physical education teacher groups have come out against the move, saying that P. E. should be about more than one type of physical activity. Some participants of show choir also have come out against the move. However, it has failed to gain sport designation in any state to become state-sanctioned and by definition is a performing art, not a sport. Competitions The cover of a program from Totino-Grace High School in 2010. Many show choirs participate in competitions, sometimes called \\"invitationals\\" (though most are not invitation-only events) or \\"festivals\\". These competitions are often held at the high school where the \\"host group\\" attends and sometimes performs as an exhibition, though some events are held at auditoriums or other facilities that can accommodate larger crowds and provide better acoustic performance. The first mainstream show choir competition held was located at Bishop Luers High School in January of 1976. Competitions can be as small as a showcase of a few groups from the immediate geographic area or they can feature many groups from multiple states. Because of the vast difference in sizes of the competitions, they can last a single afternoon or span an entire weekend. Competitions may separate competing choirs into different divisions. These divisions are often determined by age, skill level, size of the school or choir, and/or gender of the participants. The different divisions may take place at a different time, day, or at a different location or venue, though usually within the same school or close geographic area. Show choir shows or \\"sets\\" can be presented in a multitude of ways, from a more traditional approach to modern theatrical performances that tell full-length stories. These performances are often created by the choir's director, but can stem from the imagination of a group's choreographer or even outside performing arts professionals as well. As show choir grown, there has been an increasing number of schools that have invested a great deal of effort in creating quality sets that can be compared to professional stage shows. Many competitions include a preliminary round and a finals found. The finals round commences after awards from the preliminary round are complete, where the top scoring groups perform again in order to compete for the title of Grand Champion of the contest. The number of groups in the finals round is up to the hosting school, but typically 5-6 choirs participate. Those groups are sometimes given the opportunity to take suggestions, either from scoring judges or separate experts called in to give suggestions made during the preliminary round, and make adjustments to their finals performance in order to earn a better score. Hosting schools do not compete in the competition for ethical purposes. The adjudicators (or judges) at most competitions are often experts in the show choir field. They may be directors from other choirs, choreographers, arrangers, or performers from Broadway-style musicals. The judging is largely subjective and is based on the scoring style selected by the hosts. Some competitions place more emphasis on choral aspects, while others incorporate a greater emphasis on the entire show (including choreography, the band, and/or show design). Depending on the competition, each judge may only judge in their area of expertise (a choir director judging vocals, while a choreographer judging dance), or they may judge everything. Additionally, a separate judge may be added to the panel to judge the bands, and/or to select outstanding performers for separate awards. At many competitions, there are also individual, or solo, competitions which take place. They take place during the main competition in a different area than the show choir performances. Winners are announced, and they may perform at the start of the finals performance. Characteristics of a performance Des Moines Lincoln High School performing in 2017. Most show choir shows consist of a variety of songs, often including several choreographed, fast-paced pieces and one slower piece performed with limited or no choreography. This slower number‚Äîusually a ballad‚Äîexists primarily to showcase the ensemble's singing ability. In California, it is a requirement that at least one minute of any one set be sung a cappella (it is usually one full song in the set), though this is not a standard in the rest of the country. More often than not, the a cappella selection is also the ballad, as it is much easier to sing unaccompanied while holding relatively still. In the Midwest, it is becoming popular to set one song aside as a \\"novelty\\" piece, designed to make the audience laugh. \\"Concept\\" or \\"story\\" shows that unify all of the songs together in a common theme are becoming popular across the country. Within a song, vocal lines typically alternate between unison or octave singing, and two-or-more-part polyphonic harmony. Songs are chosen, adapted, and arranged from a variety of sources including popular music, jazz standards, and Broadway musicals, but rarely make use of classical music. Original music has also been performed by a small number of groups. Additionally, there is often at least one solo in each performance by a standout singer in the group. Competitive performance sets range in length, but are usually timed to total between fifteen and twenty-five minutes. Shows generally consist of, but are not limited to, approximately five songs. Popularity Show choirs have seen a rise in popularity since the American television series, \\"Glee\\" was released. The television show is based around the workings of a fictional show choir. The television show does not accurately represent the environment of a real show choir. Commitment For many high school students, show choir is a large commitment that takes over a large part of a school year. For some, show choir is part of the school curriculum and is a class taught during the day. For others, it is an extracurricular activity that requires practice to take place before or after school. Practices may begin as early as the summer for some, while other choirs don‚Äôt start until much later. The competitive season takes place from January until March or April, with competitions held across the country every weekend during that time.

It took its name by shortening the production series number (1500) by one digit in order to capitalize on the numerical auto name trend of the 1950s. The numerical designation \\"150\\" was also sporadically used in company literature. It replaced the Styleline Special model available in previous years. This model was dropped following the 1957 model year and replaced by the Delray. 1957 Chevrolet 150 2-Door Sedan  History  The One- Fifty was mainly conceived as a fleet model and little effort was spent marketing it to the average car buyer of the day, although sales weren't limited to fleets. It was most popular with police, state governments, small businesses, economy-minded consumers and hot rodders. Chevrolet sold substantially fewer One-Fifties than Two-Tens or the Chevrolet Bel Air in every year of its life. True to Chevrolet's vision, the 150 was no-frills basic transportation. It had limited options, stark trim, solid colors, plain heavy duty upholstery and rubberized flooring. Small things like ashtrays, cigarette lighters and even mirrors were extra cost options. Compared to the mid-level Two-Ten or premium Bel Air models, the One-Fifty was stark and bland. The Chevrolet Sedan Delivery, was part of the One-Fifty line, and was also designated the 1508 in the truck line. Body style choices were also limited to sedans, Handyman wagons (four-door in 1953‚Äì1954, two-door in 1955‚Äì1957) and (until 1955) the club coupe. The only body styles specific to the One-Fifty were decidedly fleet oriented ‚Äî the sedan delivery (a 2-door wagon without rear windows and the rear seat removed) and the business sedan ‚Äî a 2-door sedan with immobile rear windows and back seat removed. Powertrain choices were limited to manual transmissions and low output engines until 1954. In 1957, a full race-ready version was also available, commonly known as the \\"Black Widow\\" for its black-and-white paint color. It was equipped with 4-wheel heavy-duty brakes, 6-lug wheels and dual shock absorbers.  Collector value  In general, One-Fifties are less valuable than the sibling Two-Ten and Bel Air models on the collectors' market, but the rare surviving sedan delivery or Utility Sedan can command premium prices, particularly the 1957 model when equipped with a fuel-injected engine. V8 One-Fifties are popular with hot rod enthusiasts, due to lower curb weight and lower prices. As many One-Fifty models saw use in law enforcement, this model often serves as the basis for latter-day modification into a 1950s-era police car.  1953‚Äì1954 models  A 1953 Chevrolet 150 This was the first year for both the One-Fifty and Two-Ten. The two model years were essentially the same, except that the business coupe was renamed the Utility Sedan for 1954. The 150 came only with the base engine in 1953. The 150 came with a horn button, rather than the 210 and upscale Bel Air's horn ring.http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1953_Chevrolet/1953_Chevrolet_Brochure/1953%20Chevrolet-19.html = Powertrains = Three engines were used in the 1953‚Äì1954 model years, although not all were available at the same time.

It is a remake of the 1978 American film Fingers, and tells the story of Tom, a shady realtor torn between a criminal life and his desire to become a concert pianist. The film premiered on 17 February 2005 at the Berlin Film Festival. The film was given limited release to theaters in North America and grossed $1,023,424 and $10,988,397 worldwide. Plot Intense young \\"tough\\" Thomas Seyr is a 28-year-old real estate broker involved in shady business deals. His business partners, Fabrice and Sami, spend much of their time ruthlessly chasing squatters and illegal immigrants out of the buildings they have procured and trying to work their way around government housing regulations. Thomas is born to this kind of work; his father, Robert, is also involved in dodgy enterprises and sometimes calls upon Thomas to beat up people who refuse to pay. Tom shows a protective and defensive attitude toward his father who doesn't always appreciate what his son does for him ‚Äì so much so that when his father introduces his new girlfriend to Tom, Tom undermines her to her face, and insults her to his father, insisting she is an opportunistic \\"whore.\\" Later, when he tries to enlist her help to watch over his father, she tells him they broke up due to Robert changing his attitude and she is aware of Tom's backstabbing because Robert told her. Robert by this time is in danger from a Russian gangster, Minskov (Anton Yakovlev) who scammed him out of 300,000 Euros and Tom is worried for his safety. Tom chances upon his late mother's manager, his mother having been a concert pianist until she died 8 years previously. The manager remembers him playing something when he was 20 years old, and invites him to audition for him. The opportunity rapidly takes over Tom's imagination, becoming an obsession. He finds a teacher newly emigrated to France, virtuoso Miao Lin, to help him prepare for the audition. She speaks only Chinese, Vietnamese and some English, but no French. Tom misses appointments and drops assignments while practicing piano around the clock, and having an affair with the wife of one of his promiscuous business partners. Finally Tom reaches the high standards of his teacher, but he falls apart at the audition, having stayed up all night helping his partners with a business deal. He goes to see his father only to find the apartment destroyed and his father murdered. Tom is devastated. Two years later: Tom tests a piano onstage and gives directions to the stage manager. He drives Miao Lin to the concert hall and parks the car, when he chances to see Minskov. He follows Minskov, and takes him by surprise waiting for an elevator. They fight in the stairwell, Minskov almost shooting Tom. Tom gains the upper hand and tries to use Minskov's own gun against him, but cannot pull the trigger. Tom washes in the restroom and takes his seat in the concert hall, knuckles and shirt bloody, exchanging affectionate glances with Miao Lin at the piano. He is evidently Miao Lin's manager and partner.

The idea that affection can blossom despite a language barrier is one which Jacques Audiard has raised before in Read My Lips (starring Vincent Cassel). For the film, Duris learned to play his own piano sequences‚Äìmost notably, Bach's Toccata in E minor, trained by his sister, pianist Caroline Duris, who performs on the soundtrack. The film's French title comes from the lyrics of the Jacques Dutronc song La Fille du p√®re No√´l (\\"Santa Claus' Daughter\\"), written by Jacques Lanzmann. It translates to English as \\"My heart stopped beating\\".

Ptiloglossa is one of the most common nocturnal groups of colletids. Distribution The species of Ptiloglossa are most diverse (over 50 species) in South America and Central America. Three species, Ptiloglossa arizonensis, P. jonesi, and P. mexicana, occur in the Southwestern United States. Description Ptiloglossa consists of generally large, hairy species which are temporally-specialized crepuscular pollinators. They have greatly enlarged ocelli to assist them in flying under very low light levels. Life History They are active only at sundown (vespertine) or more typically at pre-dawn (matinal). They often utilize a pollen-extraction behavior known as buzz pollination. Like most colletids, these bees have liquid larval provisions sealed inside a membranous, cellophane-like cell lining, and it is believed that yeasts in the liquid may act as the primary protein source.

Early life and education Kodwo Eshun was born and raised in the far northern suburbs of London. His father was a prominent diplomat to the United Kingdom. His family is of the Fante people of Ghana, and his younger brother is the author and journalist Ekow Eshun. As a youth, Eshun undertook a study of comic books, J. G. Ballard, and rock music.

He studied English Literature (BA Hons, MA Hons) at University College, Oxford University, and Romanticism and Modernism MA Hons at Southampton University.

He later described his decision to pursue music journalism professionally as a devotional act that included a vow of poverty.

He illuminates the specific functions of this genre, specifically its ability \\"to engineer feedback between [a] preferred future and [a] becoming present\\" and \\"to encourage a process of disalienation.\\" Eshun deploys an unconventional framing device, inviting the reader to imagine \\"a team of African archaeologists from the future\\" attempting to reconstruct 20th-century Afrodiasporic subjectivity through a comparative study of various cultural media and artefacts. This framing technique can be read in terms of Eshun's notion of the \\"chronopolitical,\\" the \\"temporal complications and anachronistic episodes that dis- turb the linear time of progress, adjust[ing] the temporal logics that condemned black subjects to prehistory.\\" Kodwo, following Toni Morrison among others, positions African slaves as the first modern subjects, as well as ‚Äúreal world‚Äù subjects of science fiction scenarios. Thus, while hegemonic future projections implicitly or explicitly exclude black subjects from (post)modernity and its attendant techno-scientific innovations and alienations, Afrofuturism highlights the Afrodiasporic subject‚Äôs fundamental role in initiating and producing modernity. In other words, Afrofuturism ‚Äúreorient[s] history,‚Äù in part in order to offer counter- or alternative futures.Eshun, Kodwo. \\"Further Considerations on Afrofuturism\\", CR: The New Centennial Review, Vol. 3, No. 2 (Summer 2003). 297.

Before leaving Normandy, he raised an armed band of approximately 250 warriors: adventurers, outlaws, younger sons (without a future in France), and four of his own brothers, namely Asclettin, Gilbert, Ralph, and Rainulf. In Italy, he and his followers joined with Melus of Bari and Guaimar III of Salerno, Lombards in revolt against Byzantine pretensions.

The station positions itself as 88.1 The Park. WSDP is operated out of Salem High School and has been in operation since February 14, 1972. The station's current manager is Bill Keith (1991‚Äìpresent). On December 31, 2011, at noon, after stunting for several days with songs or song lyrics with the word \\"change\\" in them, such as Sheryl Crow's A Change Would Do You Good and The Georgia Satellites' Keep Your Hands to Yourself (which opens with the lyric \\"I got a little change in my pocket, going jing-a-ling-a-ling\\") with announcers promoting that \\"change is good\\" and to listen at the promised time, WSDP switched its format from alternative rock as 88.1 The Escape to Adult Contemporary as \\"The New 88.1, Plymouth and Canton's Hit Music,\\" with a playlist of pop and rock hits spanning the 1970s through today. The station also announced a contest to name the new station, in which the winner would receive a $100 gas card. The name eventually became \\"88.1 The Park\\". The first song on The New 88.1 was I Gotta Feeling by The Black Eyed Peas. The former \\"88.1 The Escape\\" specialized in playing independent alternative rock artists not played on any mainstream commercial station in the area. Special programs heard on WSDP showcased classic rock, electronica, jazz, blues, contemporary Christian and other musical genres. One highlight of the WSDP schedule was \\"Static Age\\", a punk/psychobilly show that featured local bands from the Ann Arbor/Detroit, MI Area. In 2014, 88.1 The Park was honored by the Michigan Association of Broadcasters Foundation and took home the High School Station of the Year award. It has also since 2014 up until present day, been nominated for a Marconi award for Non-Commercial Station of the Year by the NAB. The station continues to serve the Plymouth- Canton area with local news and information and high school sports broadcasts. History WSDP began as a dream of Plymouth High School English teacher Bonny Dore and principal Bill Brown in 1969, as preparations began to replace Plymouth with Salem High School. The station broadcast at 89.3 FM from its 1972 sign-on until October 1977, when a frequency swap with Eastern Michigan University's WEMU, which had been at 88.1, saw WSDP taking over 88.1 and WEMU moving to the 89.1 spot on the dial, where it remains to this day.

Biography Ramin Jahanbegloo was born in Tehran, Iran. He has a doctorate in philosophy from Sorbonne University in Paris, France where he lived for twenty years. He was a post-doctorate fellow in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University. He is married to Azin Moalej and had a daughter named Afarin Jahanbegloo. Academic and intellectual career  Jahanbegloo's intellectual activity focuses on fostering constructive dialogue between divergent cultures. He has written numerous books and articles in Persian, English and French on the subject of Western philosophy and modernity. In 1991 he published his book Conversations with Isaiah Berlin in French, which was translated into English and published the following year. The book records a series of interviews with the famous philosopher Isaiah Berlin, which cover intellectual questions ranging from the moral philosophy of Tolstoy to the meaning of liberalism. Between the years 1997-2001, he was an adjunct professor of Political Science at the University of Toronto in Canada. In 2001, he served at the National Endowment for Democracy as a fellow at the a federally funded program, known as the Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellows ProgramFellowship Programs - Past Fellows Upon returning to Tehran, he was appointed head of the Contemporary Philosophy Department of the Cultural Research Center. In his efforts to promote dialogue, he has interviewed scholars and intellectuals from all over the world, among them George Steiner, Noam Chomsky, Ashis Nandy and the Dalai Lama. In recent years, he invited Richard Rorty, Timothy Garton Ash, Antonio Negri, and Michael Ignatieff and other Western intellectuals to Iran.Reading Richard Rorty in Tehran by Samuel Thorpe, The Nation, 28 Feb. 2020, https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/reading-richard-rorty-in-tehran/ . Political detention In late April 2006, on his way to an international conference in Brussels, Jahanbegloo was arrested by the Iranian authorities. On May 3, Iran judiciary branch officials confirmed that he was arrested and sent to Evin Prison. According to some sources, he was accused of spying. The following day, a friend told CBC News that Jahanbegloo had been moved to a hospital.Human Rights Watch expressed concern over Jahanbegloo being detained without charges and called for his immediate release. According to Canadian newspaper reports on May 6, Jahanbegloo's friends suspected that he was being tortured. Their fears increased in the wake of reports that Jahanbegloo had been examined twice at the medical clinic of Evin Prison, a detention facility for political prisoners. An Iranian newspaper, Jomhuri Eslami, accused Jahanbegloo of links to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Mossad. \\"He is considered as one of the key elements in the American plan for the smooth toppling\\" of the Islamic regime\\", the newspaper stated, further charging that he was being paid by the United States to conduct \\"cultural activities against Iran.\\" On May 13, the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC), an Iranian human rights group headed by Iran's Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, voiced concern over the arrest and jailing of the prominent intellectual. On May 15, the Council of the European Union, following a meeting in Brussels, issued a press release expressing concerns about the detention of Jahanbegloo, including its underlying message that Iranians ought not to communicate or associate with Europeans: ::\\"The Council is seriously concerned about the detention of the Iranian philosopher Dr. Ramin Jahanbegloo. The Council calls upon Iranian authorities not to penalize Iranian citizens for their contacts with Europeans, including embassies, universities and cultural institutes\\". On May 19, more than 400 prominent international figures, including Nobel laureates, scholars and human rights activists, in an open letter demanded Jahanbegloo's immediate release. Among the undersigned are Noam Chomsky, J.M. Coetzee, Shirin Ebadi, Umberto Eco, J√ºrgen Habermas, Timothy Garton Ash, Leszek Ko≈Çakowski, Antonio Negri, Richard Rorty, Krzysztof Zanussi, and Howard Zinn. On June 13, Reuters reported from Tehran that Jahanbegloo was barred from seeing a lawyer during his interrogations. On July 10, the Council of the European Union issued another press release reiterating its concerns about the detention of Jahanbegloo: ::\\"The EU is particularly alarmed about the continuing detention of the respected Iranian academic Dr. Ramin Jahanbegloo, who is well known for his commitment to philosophical and moral principles, non-violence and dialogue.\\" On August 30, 2006, Jahanbegloo was released from prison after four months of confinement. His 2014 book Time Will Say Nothing: A Philosopher Survives an Iranian Prison included a narrative of his imprisonment and interrogation. On June 29, 2009, commenting on post-election chaos, Iranian minister of intelligence said, \\"there is no practical possibility of a velvet revolution in Iran\\" though he accused United States and Britain of trying to orchestrate one. He disclosed that people such as Ramin Jahanbaglou and Haleh Esfandiari had been arrested in connection with such foreign assisted plots to instigate the Iranian intelligentia but due to legal complications, no prosecution could take place. Career after imprisonment In 2006 and 2007 he was Rajni Kothari Professor of Democracy at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi, India. In January, 2008 he returned to the University of Toronto as a professor of Political Science, Massey College Scholar-at- Risk, and Research Fellow at the Centre for Ethics at Trinity College.

It is situated adjacent to the Mosque of Ahmad ibn Tulun in the Sayyida Zeinab neighborhood. The building takes its name from Major R.G. Gayer-Anderson Pasha, who resided in the house between 1935 and 1942 with special permission from the Egyptian Government. The museum is noted for being one of the best- preserved examples of 17th-century domestic architecture left in Cairo, and also for its vast collection of furniture, carpets, curio, and other objects.  Gayer-Anderson Pasha  He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1904 and was later transferred to the Egyptian Army in 1907. He was then promoted to become a Major in 1914 and during the same year, he became Assistant Adjutant- General for recruiting in the Egyptian Army. In 1919, he retired from the army to become the Senior Inspector in the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior, and he later became the Oriental Secretary to the British Residency in Cairo. He retired in 1924 but continued to live in Egypt, expanding his interests in Egyptology and Oriental Studies.  History  Bayt al-Kritliyya is considered to be one of the remarkable examples of Muslim domestic architecture in Cairo. It dates back to the Mamluk Period (1040 H./1631 A.D) and it was built by Hagg Mohamed Salem Galmam el- Gazzar. The museum consists of two houses built using the outer wall of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun as support. The larger house, located to the east (the outermost side in relation to the mosque) was built in 1632 (1041 AH) by Hajj Mohammad ibn al-Hajj Salem ibn Galman al-Gazzar. It later came into the possession of a wealthy Muslim woman from Crete, and the home became popularly known as Beit al-Kritliyya, or \\"House of the Cretan Woman.\\" The second house, to the west (the innermost side in relation to the mosque) was built in 1540 (947 AH) by Abdel-Qader al-Haddad. It later became known as \\"Beit Amna bint Salim,\\" after its last owner. The two houses were joined by a bridge at the third floor level at an unknown point, and are both collectively known as Bayt al-Kritliyya. The construction of private homes against the outer wall of a mosque was common practice, with access to both the homes and mosque via narrow streets. It was reported that in the early 20th century, the mosque of Ibn Tulun could not be seen from the outside due to the houses. In 1928 the Egyptian government began to clear the homes, many of which were in very poor condition, away from the mosque as part of a plan to make important Islamic monuments more accessible. The Committee for the Conservation of Arab Monuments objected to the demolition of Bayt al- Kritliyya, however, on the grounds that the home was extraordinarily well preserved. The home was kept intact, and repairs were made to the side walls to strengthen them after the neighboring houses were torn down. In 1935, Major Gayer-Anderson, a retired collector and self-described Orientalist, was granted permission to reside in the house, which had just been restored. Gayer-Anderson oversaw the installation of electricity and plumbing, and the restoration of fountains, pavements, and other parts of the interior of the home. He populated the building with his personal collection of art, furnishings, and carpets, and he built a sailing boat he used to collect these antiques from all over Egypt, it was docked on the Nile not far from the house. In 1942, Gayer-Anderson was forced by ill health to leave Egypt, and he gave the contents of the house to the Egyptian government. King Farouk gave him the title of Pasha in return. Gayer-Anderson died in England in 1945, and is buried in Lavenham, Suffolk. The James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me was partially shot in the museum, in the ceremonial reception hall and the rooftop terrace.  Apartments  = Subdivisions of a Mohamedan House (Haramlik and Salamlik) = The house is divided into two halves, the Haramlik, or the family residence, and the Salamlik, also known as the guest-house. The house has five main entrances; one for the ladies, a sebil, an entrance through the garden and two doors of honour. = The Haramlik = Only the master and other family members such as the wives and children had access to this side of the house. Also, close friends were allowed. The Courtyard = The Courtyard = The courtyard's floor is made of marble and the windows of the Haramlik open onto it. A stairway leading to the Haramlik is also present in the courtyard. Other remarkable objects include the Bats‚Äô Well, also known as Bier el- watawit and is about fifteen meters deep. = The Maq‚Äôad or Loggia = The Maq‚Äôad is a reception room, which in this case, is open air. There are brass bowls dating back to some time between the fourteenth and seventeenth century. Another common feature in Mamluk houses was the ‚ÄúDurkah‚Äù, a pathway from a door to another. It is where guests would put their shoes before reaching a divan. = Qa‚Äôa or Reception Room = This is the main apartment in the Haramlik. Marble tables are present. Fruits, flowers and drinks were also part of the tradition of this room. Also, there is a part of the ‚Äúholy carpet‚Äù, also known as Kiswa, in green silk, and it was a gift given by Lewa Yehia Pasha. = Service Room = This room is well known for its dresses and cupboards; which were designed by Anderson Pasha and were modeled after Turkish examples. = The Khazna or Safe- Room = The Khazna was placed between the men's and women's apartments and it was where coffee was being made. Nowadays, it is used to display miniature Persian paintings. = The Harem = This is a very large room and is supported by four columns. Also, there are windows on all four sides of the room so that the light can enter freely. There are some Persian cupboards from a palace in Teheran and each cupboard holds a different collection. = A Secret Chamber or Makhba = It is placed above the magic well and was used as a hiding place for people or objects, if they were breaking the law or trying to escape. = The Main Stairs = Stairways were not a familiar feature in Islamic architecture. In fact, they were only used in houses. On the main stair walls, a series of Persian Kashan, also known as velvet prayer-hangings, are hung. = Reading and Writing Rooms = The Reading room was quite small and had a window-seat. It has shelves, inspired by Islamic designs. The walls are decorated with Chinese Flower paintings on rice paper. The Writing Room now serves as an office for the museum‚Äôs curator but it also serves as a study room. It could be used by people looking for travel books specifically. For that reason, the room is furnished with long tables and benches. Also, the walls have pictures and ancient examples of Egyptian drawings and writings. = The Roof Garden = Bayt al-Kritliyya‚Äôs flat roof has been turned into a roof garden, and is enclosed with mashrabias. These designs are of Coptic origin and they reflect Christian symbols such as the cross. This is considered to be quite rare since the only other examples of Christian mashrabias are found in the Coptic Museum, as well as in some ancient houses in Old Cairo. = The Persian Room = Persian Room The objects present in this room are from the later Persian or Shah Abbas period, except for the bed, which originates from Egypt, and a replica of an Egyptian couch with bulls feet. = The Byzantine or Bridge Room = This is a bridge which links the Haramlik to the Salamlik. However, it is nowadays used to portray the few Christian objects present in the house. = The Ancient Egyptian Room = Originally, this was Gayer Anderson Pasha‚Äôs study room and it still contains some Ancient Egyptian objects. Some of the objects worth noticing include Egypt‚Äôs map, engraved on an ostrich egg, a black and gold mummy case, dating back to the eighteenth century BC and a bronze Ancient Egyptian cat, with gold earrings. Mohamed Ali Room = The Mohamed Ali Room = This is an Ottoman apartment with green and gold decorated walls. All objects and furniture present in the room are from the Rococo period. A piece of furniture worth noting would be the throne chair, which dates back to one of the earlier Khedives, maybe Ismail Pasha. Also, two portraits and a mechanical singing bird in a cage are present in this room. The singing bird is a Harem toy from Istanbul, and was brought by the founder‚Äôs brother. Damascus Room = The Damascus Room = This late seventeenth century room was built by the Committee for the Preservation of Arab Monuments in 1937 and was brought from Damascus by Gayer- Anderson Pasha. The whole room is made of wood, reflecting great beauty and charm. On three sides of the room are three windows (edit), while on the fourth, is the cupboard doors. The ceiling is also worthy of notice as it is inscribed with a poem, which is praising the Prophet. Other remarkable objects in this room include a collection of different colored and designed candlesticks, spread around the room.  Legends of the house  A number of legends are associated with the Bayt al-Kritliyya, and the sailing Boat(dahabeya)named La Mar√©e, which were collected by Gayer-Anderson and, published as Legends of the House of the Cretan Woman (see sources). Among the legends are: * The house was built on the remnants of an ancient mountain called Gebel Yashkur, the \\"Hill of Thanksgiving.\\" It is believed that this is where Noah's Ark came to rest after the Deluge described in both the Bible and Qur'an, and that the last of the floodwater was drained through the well in the courtyard of the house; this legend inspired him to build a sailing boat on the Nile in front of the house in old Cairo to which he gave a French name ( La Mar√©e ) meaning \\"the tide\\" * Moses was spoken to by God on this spot; * The house and the Dahabeya ( La Mar√©e )\\" his own sailing Boat on the Nile \\" were protected by a shaykh, Haroun al-Husseini, who is buried under one of the corners of the house. He is said to have blinded three men who attempted to rob the house, who stumbled around the house for three days and nights until they were finally caught; * The well in the house is said to possess miraculous qualities - for example, a lover gazing into the water would see the face of his or her sweetheart instead of his/her own reflection.  Visitor information  The museum is run by the Supreme Council of Antiquities. The Gayer-Anderson Museum is located adjacent to the Mosque of Ibn Tulun off of 'Abd al-Magid al-Labban (Al- Salbiyya) Street in Sayyida Zeinab, Cairo. It is most conveniently reached by taxi. The nearest station on the Cairo Metro, the Sayyida Zeinab station, is approximately 1 km to the west. The museum entrance can be reached through the main entrance to the mosque, or through a separate entrance toward the rear of the complex. As of January 2020, entrance fees were LE 60 for foreign adults, LE 30 for foreign students, and LE 10 for Egyptian nationals. A camera ticket costs an additional 50 pounds although mobile phone camera photos are allowed at no additional charge.

In 1979, she was converted to a cruise ship, and subsequently sailed under the names Galileo and Meridian. She sank in the Strait of Malacca in 1999 as the Sun Vista.  History  Ordered by Lloyd Triestino in 1960, Galileo Galilei was built in Italy for the Australian immigrant route. Galileo Galilei was launched on 2 July 1961. On 23 March 1963, the ship entered service for Lloyd Triestino, doing Mediterranean cruises before departing on its official maiden voyage from Genoa, Italy to Sydney, Australia on 22 April 1963. In November of the same year, she was joined on the route by her sister ship SS Guglielmo Marconi. Originally the ships traveled to Australia via the eastern route, passing through Suez Canal in both directions, but in the later years the return trip to Europe was via the Panama Canal. They also routed to Australia via the Cape of Good Hope in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The ships were very successful until the 1973 oil crisis, which, combined with the increasing prevalence of airliners, contributed to the decline of ocean liners. Galileo Galilei returned to Genoa and repaired after she struck a reef off the coast of West Africa on 13 January 1975. Galileo Galilei continued to operate on the Italy‚ÄìAustralia run until April 1977, at which point she was withdrawn from service and laid up. Her lay-up was short, and in October 1977 she returned to her builders for a lengthy reconstruction into a cruise ship. On 24 March 1979 the Galileo Galilei finally started cruise service with Italia Crociere (owned by Italia Navigazione, who also owned Lloyd Triestino). However, already in September of the same year the Galileo Galilei was withdrawn from service and laid up again. Galileo at Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven, Germany during her refit into the Meridian. In 1983, the vessel was purchased by Chandris Group. The ship was again rebuilt, this time with additional cabins on her forward deck, and her name shortened to Galileo. In 1984 the Galileo began cruising on the Caribbean under Chandris' Fantasy Cruises brand. After the collapse of Home Lines in 1988 Chandris' executives decided to create a new upmarket brand to take over the market segment occupied by Home Lines. With this in mind the Galileo sent to a multimillion-dollar refit at Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven, Germany between October 1989 and February 1990. Most of her interiors were rebuilt, and externally her rear superstructure enlarged. On 1 March 1990 she emerged as the stylish SS Meridian, the first ship of the new Celebrity Cruises brand, cruising on the Caribbean and the Boston/New York‚ÄìBermuda service. Meridian at the San Blas Islands. In 1997, following Royal Caribbean International's acquisition of Celebrity Cruises, the ship was sold to Sun Cruises, which operated her as SS Sun Vista. On 20 May 1999, the vessel suffered an engine room fire, which cut all power and caused her to sink on 21 May 1999 at 0121 hrs. All 1,090 passengers and crew were safely evacuated.

History  The neighborhood was originally farmland along the Harford Road corridor, which at the time was a major arterial route out of Baltimore City into the much more rural Harford County. Prior to its annexation into Baltimore City in 1918, Hamilton was part of Baltimore County and had its own volunteer fire department. The neighborhood began to be developed in the late 1910s and early 1920s and, for some areas, into the 1950s. Architecturally, most of the homes are similar to each other, and are larger, 1920s- and 1930s-era houses, with broad front porches and rather spacious yards, analogous to the larger suburban homes of today. Although, there are small pockets of the famous brick-faced Baltimore rowhouses scattered throughout the neighborhood, especially along Harford Road south of Echodale Avenue. Hamilton Volunteer Fire Dept. in 1910 The old Hamilton Library, listed on the National Register of Historic Places Generally speaking, Hamilton evolved into a mixed-race middle class throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with pockets of a bit more wealth within. With the shuttering of the Arcade Theater in the early 1980s, a large, community-oriented plaza and movie house was suddenly vacant, and urban blight began to creep into the commercial and cultural nexus of Hamilton, which runs from approximately Harford Road. and Echodale Avenue up to the intersection of Harford and Old Harford Roads. Beginning in the early 2000s, the Harford road corridor has seen increased urban development with award-winning restaurants including Clementine, Big Bad Wolf's House of Barbeque, the Hamilton tavern, and Los Amigos. Towards the end of 2000 other businesses and professionals began to move into the neighborhood including the eminent physical therapist, Sumesh Thomas, who started Hamilton Physical Therapy. Two art galleries and the Hamilton Arts Collective can also be found along the stretch of Harford road that runs through Hamilton. The neighborhoods of Hamilton and Lauraville have both gained Mainstreet grants to support beautification and small business development along the Harford Rd. corridor. This neighborhood is a culturally diverse area that has a strong sense of inclusion and community involvement.  Geography  The boundaries of Hamilton, like many urban neighborhoods are rather amorphous and hard to define, but is generally thought to include everything between Perring Parkway in the west, and across to Walther Avenue in the east, with Southern Avenue forming, fittingly, the southern boundary and Northern Parkway forming the northern boundary. The land is for the most part gently rolling hills, with some surprisingly steep sections for Baltimore City (for instance, Bayonne Avenue, east of Harford Road.) Herring Run flows through the western edge of the neighborhood, and its immediate watershed is an urban greenspace which comprises Herring Run Park. (Note: Echodale is the northern boundary of Lauraville. Hamilton was once called Northern Lauraville, but has taken on a name of its own. However, Lauraville runs from Argonne Drive to the south to Echodale Ave to the north.)

It was founded in 2003 and is sponsored by the Oklahoma City Public Schools system, offering a free public college- preparatory education. The school's expectation is that after graduation every student will not only enter college but earn a four-year degree, either directly out of high school or after enlisting in the military. Harding is non-selective and does not have entry tests or interviews, but in March 2012, application numbers required a lottery to be instituted for the available places. The school reflects the diversity of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area; in 2013 people of color constituted 58% of enrollment, 48% were economically disadvantaged, and two thirds of its graduates were first- generation college students. Harding has a rigorous academic curriculum based on a 4x4 (four years of math, science, English, and social studies) plan featuring required Advanced Placement courses, three years of foreign language, and fine arts. The school also emphasizes community service, requiring service hours of parents as well as students. HCP became a National Blue Ribbon School in 2013. In 2013 and 2016 the Washington Post ranked it as the most challenging high school in the state,; and in 2014 US News & World Report ranked it as the best high school in the state. In 2016 the school received an A+ grade from the state Department of Education for the fourth consecutive year.

It holds an important place in the traditions of three local Native American tribes. The summit is the highest area on the Navajo Nation. Geologic history Navajo Mountain is a prominent free-standing laccolith, a dome-shaped body of igneous rock that intruded into sedimentary layers and lifted up the overlying layer. The igneous rock at the core of the mountain is wrapped in sedimentary layers. Such igneous intrusions have been exposed by erosion and well studied in similar mountain ranges on the Colorado Plateau, such as the Henry Mountains, the Abajo Mountains, and the La Sal Range. Navajo Mountain from space The Colorado Plateau is made of mostly flat-lying layers of sedimentary rock that record paleoclimate extremes ranging from oceans to widespread deserts over the last 1.8 billion years. The peak of Navajo Mountain, at approximately , is made up of uplifted Dakota Sandstone deposited during the Cretaceous Period (approximately 66-138 million years ago). Cultural history The Navajo Mountain region has special cultural significance to the Navajo people, who know it as (\\"Earth Head\\" or \\"Pollen Mountain\\"). Together with Rainbow Bridge to the northwest, Navajo Mountain figures prominently as the first settlement area in western Navajo origin stories. Following the military defeat of the Din√© (Navajo people) by United States forces in 1863, the political landscape was changed by new boundaries and major physical alterations. The establishment of Rainbow Bridge National Monument (1910), and the filling of Glen Canyon by Lake Powell in 1963, has facilitated tourism of this previously remote region. Access to Navajo Mountain is still regulated by the sovereign Navajo Nation, and a permit is required to hike in the region. Climbing the mountain itself is forbidden. Before becoming part of the Navajo Nation, the area was inhabited by the Anasazi, or Ancestral Puebloans. Their descendants, the Hopi, call Navajo Mountain Tokonave, or \\"Heart of the Earth\\". Ruins in the area of Navajo Mountain are still strongly associated with certain Hopi clans, with priests still making pilgrimages to shrines in the area. Before 1933, when the area between the Colorado and San Juan Rivers and the Arizona border was added to the Navajo reservation, the area was known as the Paiute Strip, and the mountain itself was known as Paiute Mountain, due to the population of San Juan Paiutes living between the mountain and Monument Valley. The community of Navajo Mountain, Utah is to the east. Ecology The Navajo Mountain beardtongue (Penstemon navajoa) is a rare plant limited mainly to the upper elevation slopes of Navajo Mountain.

Over of tunnels were completed. After the liberation of the Channel Islands, the complex was converted into a museum detailing the occupation and remains a visitor attraction. History After Hitler's October 1941 order to fortify the Channel Islands (as part of the Atlantic Wall), work began on a string of fortifications all around Jersey. Ho8 was intended to be a vast network of tunnels that would allow the German occupying infantry to withstand Allied air raids and bombardment (in preparation for an invasion). Forced labourers from the Organisation Todt (as well as paid labourers and skilled workers) were shipped in to Jersey and put to work building the complex. Many of the workers were Polish, French, Russian or Republican Spaniards. Conditions were terrible, although Russian and Ukrainian POWs were treated the worst, with cases of malnutrition, death by exhaustion and disease among them becoming common. On the other hand, the voluntary workers often had much better conditions, being offered over four times the wages that they would have earned working in similar jobs for the States of Jersey, and often receiving extra food rations. In late 1943, with the threat of an Allied invasion of Europe (Operation Overlord) becoming clear, Ho8 was to be converted into a casualty clearing station and emergency hospital. The hospital had 500 beds for patients, with a full heating and air conditioning system (although the rest of the tunnel complex usually maintained a constant temperature of about , due to its being built deep into the hillside). A system of gas-proof doors was installed to maintain a clean airflow in the tunnels, and a fully equipped operating theatre was installed. Unfinished tunnels were sealed off. Despite the huge preparations and fortifications made to the Channel Islands, none were ever utilised. The occupying forces in the Channel Islands surrendered on 9 May 1945 (one day after the rest of the German forces surrendered). Ho8 fell into disuse, with British soldiers and souvenir hunters stripping the tunnels of equipment. Post-liberation and present day In July 1946, the States of Jersey opened the tunnels to the public. In 1961, the Royal Court ruled that the subterranean complex belonged to the private owners of the land above it, and Ho8 fell under private ownership. The complex was restored, with a collection of Occupation memorabilia and a museum and memorial to the occupation being set up. In 2001, a permanent exhibit called \\"Captive Island\\" was unveiled in the tunnel complex, detailing everyday life for civilians in Jersey before, during and after the occupation of Jersey. Today, Ho8 is generally referred to as the \\"Jersey War Tunnels\\". The Jersey War Tunnels has also housed military vehicles such as a Char B1 bis tank, which served in Jersey with the Panzer-Abteilung 213 during the occupation which was on loan from The Tank Museum. As of March 2012 there is also a replica Stug III tank destroyer owned by the war tunnels.

He would later serve as a key witness against Hermann G√∂ring during the Nuremberg Trials. Life Walter Schreiber was born in Berlin to Paul Schreiber (a postal inspector) and his wife Gertrud Kettlitz. After completing gymnasium in Berlin, he studied medicine at the universities of Berlin, T√ºbingen, and Greifswald. In 1914, he enlisted voluntarily for military service and served with the 42nd Infantry Regiment in France. He was injured at the First Battle of the Marne. After his recovery, he continued with his studies and served as a provisional doctor on the Western Front until the end of the war in 1918, at which time he was decorated for valor and humanitarian service by three different countries, Finland, Switzerland and Germany. In 1920, he graduated Dr. med. from the University of Greifswald and began his field studies in epidemiology in Africa. After World War I, the United States sought to assess the feasibility of using biological warfare agents in future military conflicts. As a professor of Bacteriology and Hygiene at the University of Berlin and one of the foremost experts in epidemiology, Schreiber was invited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, then known as Walter Reed General Hospital, in a scientific exchange between Germany and the United States. During this time, he reported on his studies of sleeping sickness in Africa and exchanged strategies with U.S. military medical personnel and researchers on how to prevent biological warfare. As a member of the medical branch of the German Army, and a representative of the Army Medical Inspectorate, he was charged with preventing the spread of infectious disease and developing vaccines, in particular, to guard against potential biological warfare agents. In 1942 he wrote a memorandum expressing his objections to the Third Reich's own development of such weapons, stating during his witness testimony at the Nuremberg Trials, \\"I personally made a report to Generaloberstabsarzt Handloser... It was an extremely serious matter for us physicians, for if there really should be a plague epidemic it was clear that it would not stop at the fronts, but would come over to us too. We had to bear a very grave responsibility.\\"Annie Jacobsen, Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program that Brought Nazi Scientists to America, New York: Little, Brown, 2014. , pp. 7, 164‚Äì65. Schreiber repeatedly reported to his supervising officers objections regarding experimentation being done at SS controlled facilities. In October 1942, Schreiber reported what he heard at a conference where the results of human experiments at Dachau concentration camp were presented. In May 1943, he headed the third session of the advisory specialists of the Armed Forces. This led to a confrontation in which Schreiber spoke out against human experimentation in general, but especially with biological agents such as plague and typhus, testifying later at the Nuremberg Trials that he \\"pointed out that bacteria were an unreliable and dangerous weapon\\" but that he was \\"confronted with a fait accompli\\", the decision had already been made, \\"the F√ºhrer had given the Reichsmarschall (Hermann G√∂ring) full powers, and so forth, for carrying out all the preparations.\\" In September 1943, Schreiber accepted the position of the commander of the Training Division C of the Military Medical Academy under the authority of which he denied Kurt Blome, the head of the Posen research institute, permission to conduct his plague research in Sachsenburg. This was later overruled by Himmler. At a medical conference May 16 to 18, 1944, Schreiber learned of research into gas gangrene experiments conducted by Dr. Karl Gebhardt at Hohenlychen Sanatorium. (Nuremberg document 619) In 1944, Schreiber, who had grown increasingly aware of G√∂ring's antagonism toward him, conferred with Dr. Karl Brandt, the attorney for the health care scientific advisory board about what to do. At the beinning of April, 1945, he was stripped of his administrative duties except that of medical officer in charge of the military and civilian sector of Berlin. On 30 April 1945, while caring for wounded in a makeshift hospital in Reichstag Building in Berlin, he was taken prisoner of war by the Red Army and transported to the Soviet Union. He spent time at Kransnogorsk POW camp and Lubyanka Prison. On 26 August 1946, the Soviets allowed Schreiber to appear as a witness at the Nuremberg Trials, to give evidence against G√∂ring and Kurt Blome, who had been in charge of German offensive biological weapons development.Jacobsen, pp. 232‚Äì39.Linda Hunt, Secret Agenda: The United States Government, Nazi Scientists, and Project Paperclip, 1945 to 1990, New York: St. Martin's, 1991, , p. 89. A recording of his testimony at the trial can be found at the online archive of the Imperial War Museum.International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg: Day 211 26/8/1946 Walter Schreiber questioned. Audio Recordings, Imperial War Museum, London. The transcript became part of the Nuremberg proceedings against German major war criminals.Transcripts, Trial of German Major War Criminals Nuremberg, Germany, August 26, 1946. Schreiber himself was not charged with any war crimes at the Nuremberg trials, although he was convicted in absentia by a Polish court of \\"conducting gruesome medical experiments\\" at Auschwitz. In fall 1948, Schreiber escaped Soviet captivity and immediately gave himself over to the Americans. In a press conference on 2 November, he explained that he had initially been held in Lubyanka Prison in the Soviet Union where he became deathly ill. Only when the captured former German ambassador to Soviet Union, Norbert von Baumbach, became ill and refused care from anyone but Schreiber, was the doctor's true identity discovered by Soviet authorities. Schreiber reported he was then given medical attention and moved to a series of safe houses in the Soviet Zone of Germany. There he remained to provide medical care to former Nazi generals. Still under Soviet custody, he was later given the rank of starshina, and was ultimately offered the position of Chief Medical Officer in the newly formed East German Police Force, the Volkspolizei. Rejecting this position, Schreiber reported that he was then offered a professorship at the University of Leipzig. However, in hopes of finding his family, he requested the University of Berlin instead. In response, Soviet authorities reported they were holding Schreiber's family in the Soviet Union, thereby convincing him to relocate and join other German scientists who had already been taken there (see Russian Alsos). In the meantime, his daughter, who had presented herself to Allied military authorities in the American Occupation Zone, learned that the Soviets were transporting more German scientists to the Soviet Union, her father presumably among them. Boarding multiple trains, she walked the cars until she caught her father's attention. Seeing an opportunity, Schreiber evaded his handler and on 17 October took a train from Dresden to Berlin where he presented himself to the Allied Control Authority in West Berlin.Jacobsen, pp. 322‚Äì30. Schreiber was subsequently hired to work with the Counter Intelligence Corps and beginning in 1949 was employed as post physician at Camp King, a large clandestine POW interrogation center in Oberursel, Germany.Jacobsen, pp. 331‚Äì33. =Emigration= In 1951, Schreiber was taken to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. He arrived in New York on September 17, 1951, on the with his wife Olga Conrad Schreiber, his son Paul-Gerhard Schreiber, and his mother-in-law, Marie Schulz Conrad. The manifest of the ship does not list travel documents for them, but declares them to be \\"Paper Clips\\". On 7 October 1951, the New York Times reported that he was working at the Air Force School of Medicine at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas in the Department of Preventative Medicine. A Janina Iwa≈Ñska who was being treated at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston was shown a photo of Schreiber and asked if he was the scientists who had experimented on her at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. She said \\"no,\\" but that he was there. Her physician contacted the Boston Globe and started a petition to have Schreiber investigated. The second article also by Drew Pearson published February 10, 1952 includes Schreiber's claim that he had never been to Ravensbr√ºck nor any other concentration camp and that he never conducted or supervised any experiments on human beings. That same article also includes a statement by the Air Force Surgeon General stating that he questions such accusations because Schreiber was not a defendant at Nuremberg, but a witness. If there was any evidence against him, they would have included him as a defendant at that time.Jacobsen, pp. 348‚Äì56. Schreiber, consequently, did not seek to renew his contract with the U.S. Air Force. Instead he left Texas for the Bay Area of California, where one of his daughters lived. And from there, the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency arranged visas for him and his family to move to Argentina, where another one of his daughters was living and had recently given birth to Schreiber's first grandchild. On 22 May 1952, they were flown on a military aircraft to New Orleans and from there to Buenos Aires.Jacobsen, pp. 361‚Äì63.Hunt, p. 90. In Argentina, he worked as a practitioner of general medicine, essentially as a country doctor, in the community of San Carlos de Bailoche where he settled. He died suddenly of a heart attack on 5 September 1970 in San Carlos de Bariloche, R√≠o Negro, Argentina.Jacobsen, p. 363.

It might include the involvement of customers, suppliers and multiple stakeholders such as agencies and consultants Usually, firms that promote open forms of collaboration benefit from having access to different capabilities and knowledge, enhancing their competitiveness and accelerating their innovation process. On one hand, it enables small companies such as start-ups to partner with other players, complementing each other and taking advantage of different perspectives and resources. On the other hand, it helps large companies to speed-up their innovation process and time-to-market, overcoming bureaucracy and inflexible procedures. Collaboration can occur in all aspects of the business cycle, depending on the context: * Procurement and supplier collaboration * Research and development of new products, services and technologies * Marketing, distribution and commercialization Collaborative innovation network (CoIN) is a type of collaborative innovation practice that makes use of the internet platforms such as email, chat, social networks, blogs, and Wikis to promote communication and innovation within self- organizing virtual teams. The difference is that people that collaborate in CoIN are so intrinsically motivated that might not be paid nor get any advantage. Thus, a CoIN is a social construct with a huge potential for innovation. It has been defined by the originator of the term, Peter Gloor from MIT Sloan's Center for Collective Intelligence, as \\"a cyberteam of self- motivated people with a collective vision, enabled by the Web to collaborate in achieving a common goal by sharing ideas, information, and work\\". Indeed, CoIN is a type of open collaboration that helps organizations to become more creative, productive and efficient. By adopting CoIN as part of their culture, these companies accelerate innovation, uncover hidden business opportunities, reduce costs and enhance synergies. They not only can engage employees from every level of hierarchy towards a common project (discovering new talents and promoting direct relation between employees) but also partner with external parties. Similar is the concept of the \\"Self-Organizing Innovation Network\\", it has been described by author, Robert Rycroft of the Elliott School of International Affairs of George Washington University. Overview CoINs feature internal transparency and direct communication. Members of a CoIN collaborate and share knowledge directly with each other, rather than through hierarchies. They come together with a shared vision because they are intrinsically motivated to do so and seek to collaborate in some way to advance an idea. CoINs work across hierarchies and boundaries in which members can directly and openly exchange ideas and information. This collaborative and transparent environment fosters innovation. Gloor describes phenomenon as \\"swarm creativity\\". According to him, \\"CoINs are the best engines to drive innovation\\". CoINs existed well before the advent of modern communication technology. However, internet and instant communication improved productivity and enabled the reach of a global scale. Today, they rely on Internet, e-mail, and other communications vehicles for information sharing. According to Peter Gloor, CoINs have 5 main characteristics: * Dispersed Membership: technology allows members to be spread over the world. Regardless of the location, members share a common goal and are convinced of their common cause. * Interdependent Membership: cooperation between members is key to achieve common goal. The work of one member is affected and interdependent on the others' work. * No simple chain of command: there is no superior command. It is a decentralized and self-organized system. Conflicts are solved without the need of a hierarchy or authority. * Work towards a common goal: members are willing to contribute, work and share freely. They are intrinsically motivated to donate their work, create and share knowledge in favor of a common goal. * Dependence on trust: cooperative behavior and mutual trust is needed to work efficiently within the network. Members act accordingly to an ethical code that states the rules and principles to be followed by all members. Usually, ethical codes include principles related to respect, consistency, reciprocity and rationality. There also are five essential elements of collaborative innovation networks (what Gloor calls as \\"genetic code\\"): 1\\\\. They are learning networks: they set an informal and flexible environment which facilitates and stimulates collaboration and the exchange of ideas, information and knowledge. 2\\\\. They need an ethical code: they agree on an ethical code that guides the conduct and behavior of the members. 3\\\\. They are based on trust and self-organization: members trust each other without the need of a centralized management. They are brought together by mutual respect and strong sense of shared beliefs. 4\\\\. They make knowledge accessible to everyone: CoINs nurture communication to an extent that information shared with everyone. Nowadays, with internet and social medias, their ideas and concepts achieve a global level. 5\\\\. They operate in internal honesty and transparency: they create a system based on reciprocal trust and mutually established principles.  Examples  CoINs have been developing many disruptive innovations such as the Internet, Linux, the Web and Wikipedia. These inventions were created in universities or labs by a group of students with little or no budget. They were not focused on the money but on the sense of accomplishment. The Web is the early version of Internet. It was driven by a CoIN of intrinsically motivated people that wanted to improve technical development and launch a disruptive solution. Their goal was to link mainframes and allow multiple users simultaneously. Another contribution was Linux, an operating system for personal computing that directly competes with Microsoft. It was initially developed by a student called Linus Torvalds and later became an open source software. The code is publicly available and anyone can contribute or enhance it. The success of Linux is the constant and continuous updating which is done at a much lower cost than closed source software. Wikipedia gathers thousands of volunteers that constantly write and update content. Although it does not have a hierarchy nor a central authority, the entries are mostly accurate and complete. Volunteers share a strong feeling of community and willingness to contribute towards knowledge without being paid for it. Faced with these creations, large companies such as IBM and Intel have learnt to use the principles of open innovation to enhance their research learning curve. They increased or established collaborations with universities, agencies and small companies to accelerate their processes and launch new services faster. Collaborative innovation network factors Asheim and Isaksen (2002) conclude that innovative network contribute to the achievement of optimal allocation of resources, and promoting knowledge transfer performance. However, there are four factors of collaborative innovation network that differently affect the performance of CoINs. Those factors are: 1\\\\. network size: network size is the number of partners such as enterprises, universities, research institutions, intermediaries, and government departments in an innovative network. Previous work reveals that network size has a positive effect on knowledge transfer as it provide the actor (e.g. firm) with two major substantive benefits: one is the exposure to a larger amount of external information, knowledge, and ideas and the other is resource sharing between the actor and its contacts such as knowledge sharing, reduction of transaction costs, complementarities, and scale. 2\\\\. network heterogeneity: network heterogeneity refers to differences in the knowledge, technology, ability, and size of members in the network. Firms in a more heterogeneous network have a higher probability to acquire external knowledge resources. When network heterogeneity is higher, getting complementary resources and accelerating the speed of knowledge transfer are easier. 3\\\\. network tie-strength: Tie-Strength refers to the nature of a relational contact and includes the degree of intimacy, duration, and frequency; the breadth of topic usually refers to time length, tie depth, emotional intensity, intimacy frequency, and interactive connection. A collaborative innovative network with a high level of tie-strength can provide firms with effective information and knowledge, reduce risk and uncertainty in the innovation process, and achieve successful knowledge transfer. 4\\\\. network centrality: Network centrality refers to an actor's position in a network. Actors centrally located in a network are in an advantageous position to monitor the flow of information and have the consequent advantage of having large numbers of contacts who are willing and able to provide them with important opportunities and resources. Current challenges Collaborative innovation still needs to be empowered. A more collaborative approach involving stakeholders such as governments, corporations, entrepreneurs and scholars is key to tackling the main challenges facing today. First of all, it is still important to raise awareness of CoIN and its benefits among companies and major economic fields. Policy makers and corporate leaders could support the development of programs, strategies and educational plans to stimulate CoINs in specific sectors, benefiting the whole economy. Second, the overall legal and regulatory framework still needs to evolve to foster cross-firm collaboration. Fiscal and intellectual property regimes should be reviewed to provide the necessary infrastructure to nourish CoINs. A further stimulus is important to encourage the creation of start-ups and the development of a network of partners across companies. Finally, financial aid should be granted to support collaborative projects related to technology, research and innovation. CoINs have an enormous potential to deliver innovation and drive significant gains in competitiveness. However, they need resources in order to fully operate and reach their maximum potential.  Future  As CoINs become increasingly popular among governments and corporations, the ethical, financial, economic, and cognitive issues which drive incentives will inevitably face challenges. Over time potential innovators may be unwilling to participate in projects merely on the basis of implied financial gain. As globalization begins to impact traditional models of planned social progress, the broader political context in which participants cooperate has become more relevant lately. This suggests an increased need for independent parties to collaborate on the basis of agreed upon principles and objectives, ultimately this could encompass the interests of humanity and the emergence of a global culture.

It states that in a crystalline solid subject to a small strain, the positions of the atoms within the crystal lattice follow the overall strain of the medium. The currently accepted form is Max Born's refinement of Cauchy's original hypothesis which was used to derive the equations satisfied by the Cauchy stress tensor. The approximation generally holds for face-centered and body- centered cubic crystal systems. For complex lattices such as diamond, however, the rule has to be modified to allow for internal degrees of freedom between the sublattices. The approximation can then be used to obtain bulk properties of crystalline materials such as stress-strain relationship. For crystalline bodies of finite size, the effect of surface stress is also significant. However, the standard Cauchy‚ÄìBorn rule cannot deduce the surface properties. To overcome this limitation, Park et al. (2006) proposed a surface Cauchy‚ÄìBorn rule. Several modified forms of the Cauchy‚ÄìBorn rule have also been proposed to cater to crystalline bodies having special shapes. Arroyo & Belytschko (2002) proposed an exponential Cauchy Born rule for modeling of mono-layered crystalline sheets as two-dimensional continuum shells. Kumar et al.

Subjects explored included suggestions of corrupt and dishonest policing in County Donegal but its recommendations and conclusions have more widespread consequences and importance. The Morris Tribunal was created by a resolution of the Oireachtas on 28 March 2002 and by Instrument entitled Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 (Establishment of Tribunal) Instrument, 2002 made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 24 April 2002. Its formal title was The Tribunal of Inquiry into complaints concerning some Garda√≠ of the Donegal Division. It is known as the Morris Tribunal after its chairman and sole member, Justice Frederick Morris, a former president of the Irish High Court and a judge of the Special Criminal Court. The tribunal concluded its public hearings in December 2007. Its final report was issued in October 2008. Background The Morris Tribunal takes place against probably the most over-reaching reform of the Garda√≠ in its history, the Garda S√≠och√°na Act 2005, which established the Garda Ombudsman Commission and other strategic initiatives. So far, it has resulted in the resignations of several senior officers in the force, including one Chief Superintendent and three Superintendents, after they were criticised for negligence, as well as the firing of another Superintendent found to be corrupt. Several other present and former officers of various ranks have been criticised for negligence, found to have lied, or been found to have acted corruptly. Modules Evidence in all modules in the tribunal's terms of reference were heard. All reports were published by October 2008. The first substantive report was published in 2004; the second in 2005 and reports three, four and five were published in August 2006. The remaining reports covered an investigation into the interrogation of 12 suspects in Garda custody detained in connection with the death of Richard Barron; allegations that interview rooms in Garda stations were bugged; anonymous allegations of Garda corruption at the highest level; allegations of a campaign of Garda harassment directed against the extended McBrearty family, their employees and others in Co Donegal; and the effectiveness of the Garda Complaints Board in dealing with complaints from the extended family and others. =Report 1 Faked Explosives Discovery= The first report, in June 2004, concerned allegations that two Donegal based detectives, Superintendent Kevin Lennon and Detective Garda Noel McMahon, faked a series of explosives finds in the border county in 1993 and 1994. Findings of culpability in respect of individual members of the Garda S√≠och√°na were made. The extent of culpability ranged from instances of negligence to, in the cases of Superintendent Lennon and Detective Garda McMahon, of corruptly orchestrating the planting of ammunition and hoax explosives. Chief Supt Denis Fitzpatrick, who was cited as being 'gravely at fault' in not investigating the activities Lennon and McMahon relating to implicating a person as IRA informer, took early retirement from the Garda in July 2004. Lennon, who was suspended on full pay in August 2002 on foot of the Frank Shortt* affair and was fired from the Garda in October 2004. McMahon resigned from the force before the Garda Commissioner could dismiss him from the force. (* Frank Shortt, a Donegal publican, was adjudged to have been wrongly convicted by \\"perjured Garda evidence\\" following \\"a conspiracy to concoct false evidence\\" by McMahon and Lennon.) The report also makes general recommendations arising from its findings, including the need for a more pro- active role for Garda Headquarters in the management of Garda Divisions, the need for improved recording and reporting of incidents, the immediate restoration of the discontinued practice of members of Inspector rank and above keeping daily official journals, the need for an urgent review of policy in relation to the handling of informants, and the need for a specific obligation on members of the Garda S√≠och√°na to account truthfully for any actions taken in the course of duty, with failure to account constituting a serious breach of discipline warranting dismissal. The report also, while it makes no specific recommendation on the matter, questions the adequacy of the Garda promotion system in identifying and advancing persons with the necessary aptitude and skills, and calls for the system to be looked at (and in fact significant changes are already underway as part of the Garda reform process). =Report 2 Richard Barron= The second report in June 2005 concerned the Barron Investigation module, which looked at events following the hit and run death on 14 October 1996 of cattle dealer Richie Barron, which police mistakenly treated as a murder inquiry; and hoax extortion calls received by Michael and Charlotte Peoples on 9 November 1996. The second report exposed further evidence of lies, malice and incompetence among the force in Donegal. The Tribunal chairman described the investigation into the death of cattle dealer Richie Barron as \\"an extraordinary shambles\\". \\"There is evidence of willful blunders, gross negligence, laziness, emotionally wrong-headed rushes to judge people as guilty and a determination by some parties to ensure that, even if there was no evidence, that the suspicions formulated were going to stick and stick permanently\\". The Garda response. was to set up five separate Working Groups to consider: * A review of the role of Crime & Security Branch (CSB). * External Professional Assistance * Training * Reporting within the Garda S√≠och√°na (including reporting to the Department of JELR) * Professional & Ethical Conduct =Report 3 Silver Bullet= The third report deals with allegations made by Bernard Conlon that he was acting as an agent of the Garda S√≠och√°na in respect of his being found on the nightclub/public house premises of Frank McBrearty Snr in Raphoe on 31 August 1997, and further that in making a complaint that two men arrived at his door late on the evening of 20 June 1998 he was acting as an agent of the Garda S√≠och√°na. The report concludes that a member of the public, Mr Bernard Conlon, was induced by former Detective Sergeant John White (assisted by Garda John Nicholson) with the promise of reward to be found being served alcohol after hours on the licensed premises of Mr Frank McBrearty Snr. The purpose of this was to provide a reliable witness in a prosecution under the licensing laws against Mr McBrearty Snr. The report also deals with allegations by Mr Conlon that Mr Mark McConnell and Mr Michael Peoples threatened him with a silver bullet because of his forthcoming testimony against Mr McBrearty. The report concludes that the allegations themselves were false. The report recommends that the use of a person as a Garda agent and witness needs to be subject to strict controls and that urgent consideration has to be given to the formulation of written guidelines to cover this aspect of police work. Arising from earlier Morris reports, the Garda S√≠och√°na conducted a full review of existing policy, practices and procedures relating to the handling and management of informants and has put in place a new protocol and policy encompassing best police standards in the management and use of covert human intelligence sources. CHIS ‚Äì Covert Human Intelligence Source management is now in place throughout the Force. All aspects of the protocol will now be reviewed by the Garda Authorities. It also recommends that the Garda disciplinary code needs to be revised and streamlined to be able to deal more efficiently and swiftly with disciplinary issues arising within the Service. =Report 4 Ardara= This module deals with an arson attack on a telecommunications mast at Alt na gCapall, Ardara, County Donegal and a later explosives device in the same location in November 1996 within the context of a local protest against the addition of an MMDS mast to the site which was then ongoing. The telecommunications mast was the subject of controversy and protest locally. The Tribunal has concluded that an 'explosive device' was caused to be put on the mast by former Sergeant John White for the purpose of using section 30 of the Offences against the State Acts to arrest some of the protestors although it could not go so far as to say that he actually placed it there. Mr White is seeking a judicial review of the tribunal's findings. The report recommends that there needs to be a mechanism in place within the Garda S√≠och√°na whereby a serving member can speak in confidence to a designated officer in Garda Headquarters on concerns about misconduct within the Service. Regulations for a Whistleblower's charter within the Garda S√≠och√°na have been drawn up and are being finalised in consultation with the Commissioner, the Ombudsman Commission and Garda Inspectorate, as provided for in the Garda S√≠och√°na Act 2005. =Report 5 Burnfoot= This module examined the circumstances surrounding the alleged planting of a firearm 22 May 1998, to effect the arrest and detention of seven persons (members of the traveller community) at Burnfoot, County Donegal at 8.00 AM the following day on foot of search warrants and the investigation relating to this. The finding of such a weapon meant that an arrest under S30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 could be justified. While Detective Sergeant White was acquitted on a criminal charge on 27 July 2006 of possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, the Tribunal was satisfied that he planted a shotgun at the Travellers' encampment so as to justify an arrest under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act. The Tribunal found that he was aided in this by Detective Garda Thomas Kilcoyne. The Tribunal also found that when Sergeant White was subsequently arrested and charged in relation to this incident Sergeant Jack Conaty, Garda Martin Leonard and Garda Patrick Mulligan conspired together to invent a story to acquit Sergeant White. The Tribunal has concluded that proper discipline has been lost in the Force and the disciplinary machinery has become overlaid with an unnecessary degree of legal formalism. The report acknowledges the proud record of the Garda S√≠och√°na, but warns that firm action is required to address the question of indiscipline within the Garda S√≠och√°na. It says that firm but fair measures relating to discipline are required to restore morale and if such action is not taken, the abuses which led to the establishment of the Tribunal will be repeated. While the issue of indiscipline has been highlighted in previous reports, it is the scale of the problem as found by Judge Morris that comes through most starkly in the Burnfoot report. The Burnfoot Report also indicates that the Tribunal has been disturbed by the manner in which search warrants under section 29 of the Offences against the State Act are issued by Garda Superintendents. The Tribunal recommends that urgent consideration be given to vesting the power to issue warrants under Section 29 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, at present vested in officers of the Garda S√≠och√°na not below the level of Superintendent, in judges of District Court and Circuit Court. The Tribunal recognises that there are very limited occasions upon which time would be so pressing as to make it impossible to follow such a procedure and that, in any event, a residual power for such eventuality could, perhaps, still be vested in a senior officer of the Garda S√≠och√°na to be used in exceptional circumstances. Scathing Criticism of the Garda S√≠och√°na Evidence has been examined by the Tribunal from garda√≠ based both within the Donegal division and members of varying ranks based elsewhere in the country. The Tribunal compliments many individual garda√≠ but severely and trenchantly criticises others. =Discipline= The Tribunal has been staggered by the amount of indiscipline and insubordination it has found in the Garda force. There is a small but disproportionately influential core of mischief-making members who will not obey orders, who will not follow procedures, who will not tell the truth and who have no respect for their officers. Garda Martin Leonard is cited in this regard ‚Äì applying to arrest a colleague in an investigation in which he was not involved, not wearing his uniform, lying at will and continually testing the waters as to the vulnerability of his colleagues. The behaviour of three garda witnesses, Sgt Conaty, Garda Mulligan and Garda Martin Leonard, in all of this beggars belief; and yet it happened in the course of a Tribunal hearing that was much extended by their dissimulation, the Tribunal was used a sounding board for deceit in the hope that it too could be inveigled into believing lies. White stated in a media interviews that the Tribunal findings against him, were based on \\"hearsay, innuendo and rumour\\", ‚Äì rather than the thousands of documents admitted as evidence and hundreds of days at hearing. =Code of Discipline= Inquiries relating to garda discipline can take years to unravel due to the overlay of legal formalism in the process. Procedures can be used to frustrate and delay simple and straightforward investigations. The Tribunal has made recommendations in respect of this. A new draft code of discipline was published by Justice Minister Michael McDowell at the publication of the third, fourth and fifth reports of the tribunal, but so far has not been implemented. =Management= The Tribunal observes that when trust is absent and management is infirm ‚Äì damage ensues =Search Warrants= The Tribunal recommends that power to issue Section 29 search warrants under the Offences Against the State Act (1939) be vested in a District Court justice to balance the interests of the garda√≠ and the constitutional rights of the person to be searched. The Minister for Justice has proposed amendments to allow judicial oversight of warrants issued under emergency powers legislation, but senior officers will still have power to issue warrants in \\"exceptional circumstances.\\" See also *Other public inquiries *Tribunal References External links * Morris Tribunal Politics of the Republic of Ireland 2002 in Ireland Public inquiries in Ireland Police misconduct in Ireland ","title":"Morris Tribunal"},{"id":"4985687","text":"Mount St. Mary's Hospital and Health Center is a Catholic hospital in Lewiston, New York, just north of Niagara Falls, New York, where approximately 60% of the hospital's patients reside.

Early life Ren√© de Froulay, Comte de Tess√© was born at the family home of the Chateau de Vernie, near Le Mans on 14 May 1648, son of Ren√©, Comte de Tess√© (1600-1659) and Madeleine de Beaumanoir de Lavardin (1618-1682); his younger brother Philibert-Emmanuel de Froulay (1651-1701) was also a soldier. His maternal grandfather Jean de Beaumanoir, Marquis de Lavardin (1551-1610) was born a Protestant but like many in that period changed sides and religions when needed and ended his career as a trusted advisor of Henry IV. Ren√© married Marie Fran√ßoise Auber d'Aunay on 10 June 1674 and they had seven children, four of whom survived childhood. He was succeeded by his eldest son Ren√©-Mans de Froulay (1681-1746) who married Marie Elisabeth Bouchu in April 1706. His grandson and namesake Ren√© de Froulay, Comte de Tess√© and Marquis de Lavardin (1736‚Äì1814) married Adrienne Catherine de Noailles (1741-1813). She was later famous as a patron of the composer Mozart and friend and correspondent of Thomas Jefferson when he was US Ambassador to France between 1784-89.  Career  Like many of his contemporaries, de Tess√© played an active role in the wars of Louis XIV; in 1669, he was appointed to the staff of Marshall Fran√ßois de Cr√©quy and raised a regiment of dragoons which took part in the Franco-Dutch war of 1672-78. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, he carried out the so-called dragonnade of Huguenots in the Principality of Orange and was military commander of the Dauphin√© and Languedoc provinces in 1686. The facade of Heidelberg Castle, destroyed in 1689 and never rebuilt. At the start of the Nine Years' War in 1688, he was part of the army under Montclar that invaded the Rhineland. When France withdrew in 1689, Louis XIV ordered a scorched-earth policy; de Tess√© commanded operations in the Palatinate, including the burning of Heidelberg and destruction of over 20 substantial towns and villages. He later fought in Northern Italy against Savoy, commanding the garrison of the strategic town of Pinerolo in Piedmont. Starting in 1693, he acted as Louis' representative in secret negotiations with Victor Amadeus that led to the 1696 Treaty of Turin between France and Savoy. When the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701, de Tess√© commanded the French garrison at Mantua; he was wounded several times, his brother Philibert-Emmanuel dying of dysentery at Cremona the same year. He was appointed Marshal of France in 1703 and in 1704 Commander-in- Chief of Bourbon troops in Spain, replacing the Duke of Berwick. In this role he became close to the young King Philip V. In 1706, de Tess√© commanded Bourbon forces besieging Barcelona but they were over-stretched; British control of the seas made it impossible to prevent the city being resupplied and the Bourbon army was forced to retreat. Despite this, in 1707 he commanded the field army that prevented Prince Eugene taking the key French naval base of Toulon. This appears to have been his last active military command. In 1708, he acted as French Ambassador in Rome, then Spain in 1723, when he persuaded Philip V to resume the Spanish throne after the death of his eldest son Louis I. He was also Governor General of the Perche and his home province of Maine. He died in 1725 at the Camaldolese monastery in Grosbois.

It can be utilized to further investigations for both criminal and civil cases. Two of the most important factors to be constantly considered throughout the collection, processing, and analysis of evidence, are the maintenance of chain of custody as well as contamination prevention, especially considering the nature of the majority of biological evidence. Forensic biology is incorporated into and is a significant aspect of numerous forensic disciplines, some of which include forensic anthropology, forensic entomology, forensic odontology, forensic pathology, forensic toxicology. When the phrase \\"forensic biology\\" is utilized, it is often regarded as synonymous with DNA analysis of biological evidence. Disciplines =DNA analysis= DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is one of the most popular pieces of evidence to recover at a crime scene. More often than not, evidence containing DNA is regarded to as biological evidence. With all of the substantial advances that have been made regarding DNA, biological evidence is recognized to be the golden standard in forensic science. At the scene, biological evidence must be initially visibly recognized. Sometimes this is not always possible and the aid of an alternative light source, or ALS, is required. Once identified as a potential source, presumptive tests are conducted to establish the possibility of the specified biological presence (semen, saliva, blood, urine, etc.). If positive, samples are collected and submitted for analysis in the laboratory, where confirmatory tests and further tests are performed. DNA analysis has numerous applications such as paternity testing, identifications of unknown human remains, cold case breakthroughs, as well as connecting suspects and/or victims to a piece(s) of evidence, a scene, or to another person (victim or suspect, respectively). Nuclear DNA evidence can be recovered from blood, semen, saliva, epithelial cells and hair (if the root is still intact). Furthermore, Mitochondrial DNA can be recovered from the shaft of hair, bone and the roots of teeth. For most forensic DNA samples, STR analysis of autosomal short tandem repeats is performed in an attempt to individualize the sample to one person with a high degree of statistical confidence. TaqMan ProbesSTR electropherogram of a three-person mixture Laboratory analysis of DNA evidence involves the sample DNA being extracted, quantitated, amplified, and visualized. There are several methods of DNA extraction possible including organic (phenol-chloroform) extraction, Chelex extraction, and differential extraction. Quantitation is commonly conducted using a form of the polymerase chain reaction, known as real-time PCR, quantitative PCR, or qPCR. qPCR is the preferred method of DNA quantitation for forensic cases because it is very precise, human-specific, qualitative, and quantitative. This technique analyses changes in fluorescence signals of amplified DNA fragments between each PCR cycle without needing to pause the reaction or open the temperature- sensitive PCR tubes. In addition to the components necessary for standard a PCR reaction (i.e. template DNA, carefully designed forward and reverse primers, DNA polymerase [usually Taq], dNTPs, and a buffer solution containing Mg2+), qPCR reactions involve fluorescent dye-labelled probes that complement and anneal to the DNA sequence of interest that lies between the two primers. A ‚Äúreporter‚Äù (R) dye is attached at the 5‚Äô end of the fluorescent probe while a ‚Äúquencher‚Äù (Q) dye is attached at the 3‚Äô end. Before the DNA strands are extended by the polymerase, the reporter and quencher are close enough in space that no fluorescence is detected by the instrument (the quencher completely absorbs/masks the fluorescence of the reporter). As the polymerase begins to extend the strand, the 5' end of the probe is degraded by the polymerase due to its exonuclease activity. The reporter dye is released from the 5‚Äô end and is no longer quenched, thus enabling detection of fluorescence. A graph is constructed for the sample DNA comparing the presence of fluorescence (y-axis) to cycle number (x-axis) of the qPCR process. This is then compared to a standard curve of the cycle fluorescence threshold (y-axis) versus the log of known DNA concentrations (x-axis). By comparing the sample data to the standard curve, one may extrapolate the DNA concentration in the sample, which is essential to move forward with PCR amplification and capillary electrophoresis to obtain a DNA profile. DNA profiles are produced in the form of an electropherogram. The obtained profile can be compared to known samples such as those in CODIS in order to identify a possible suspect. Based on known frequencies of the genotype found in the DNA profile, the DNA analyst may place a statistical measure of confidence on DNA match.  Mitochondrial DNA analysis  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is used instead of nuclear DNA when forensic samples have been degraded, are damaged, or are in very small quantities. In many cases there may be human remains that are older, sometimes ancient, and the only options for DNA collection are the bone, teeth, or hair of the body. mtDNA is able to be extracted from such degraded samples because its presence in cells is much higher than nuclear DNA. There can be more than 1,000 copies of mtDNA in a cell, while there are only two copies of nuclear DNA. Nuclear DNA is inherited from both the mother and the father but mtDNA is passed down from only the mother to all of her offspring. Due to this type of inheritance, mtDNA is useful for identification purposes in forensic work but can also be used for mass disasters, missing persons cases, complex kinship, and genetic genealogy. As mentioned, the main advantage of using mtDNA is its high copy number. However, there are a few disadvantages of using mtDNA as opposed to nuclear DNA. Since mtDNA is inherited maternally and passed to each offspring, all members of the maternal familial line will share a haplotype. A haplotype \\"is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent\\". The sharing of this haplotype among family members can cause an issue in forensic samples because these samples are often mixtures that contain more than one DNA contributor. Deconvolution and interpretation of mtDNA mixtures is more difficult than that of nuclear DNA and some laboratories choose not to attempt the process Since mtDNA does not recombine, the genetic markers are not as diverse as autosomal STRs are in the case of nuclear DNA. Another issue is that of heteroplasmy. Heteroplasmy is when an individual has more than one type of mtDNA in their cells. This can cause an issue in the interpretation of data from questioned forensic samples and known samples that contain mtDNA. Having adequate knowledge and understanding of heteroplasmy can help ensure successful interpretation. There are some ways to improve success of mtDNA analysis. Preventing contamination at all testing stages and using positive and negative controls is a priority. In addition, the use of mini-amplicons can be beneficial. When a sample of mtDNA is severely degraded or has been obtained from an ancient source, the use of small amplicons can be used to improve the success of amplification during PCR. In these cases primers amplifying smaller regions of HV1 and HV2 in the control region of mtDNA are used. This process has been referred to as the 'ancient DNA' approach. The first use of mtDNA as evidence in court was in 1996 in State of Tennessee v. Paul Ware. There was only circumstantial evidence against Ware so the admittance of mtDNA from hairs found in the victim's throat and at the scene were key to the case. In 2004, with the help of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and ChoicePoint, mtDNA was used to solve a 22-year-old cold case where the nuclear DNA evidence was not originally strong enough. After mtDNA analysis, Arbie Dean Williams was convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Linda Strait, which had occurred in 1982. In 2012, mtDNA evidence allowed investigators to establish a link in a 36-year-old investigation into the murders of four Michigan children. Hair fibers found on the bodies of two of the children were tested and the mtDNA found to be the same for each sample. For the investigators this was a big break because it meant that the murders were likely connected. =Forensic anthropology= Anthropology is applied to forensics most regularly through the collection and analysis of human skeletal remains. The primary goals of anthropological involvement include identification and aiding in scene reconstruction by determining details regarding the circumstances of the victim's death. In cases where conventional techniques are unable to determine the identity of the remains due to the lack of soft tissue, anthropologists are required to deduce certain characteristics based on the skeletal remains. Race, sex, age and possible ailments can often be determined through bone measurements and looking for clues throughout the skeletal structure. =Forensic botany= A Forensic botanist looks to plant life in order to gain information regarding possible crimes. Leaves, seeds and pollen found either on a body or at the scene of a crime can offer valuable information regarding the timescales of a crime and also if the body has been moved between two or more different locations. The forensic study of pollen is known as forensic palynology and can often produce specific findings of location of death, decomposition and time of year. The knowledge of systematics leads to identification of evidences at crime scene. The morphological and anatomical study revels in collection of samples from crime scene and its in vitro analysis. It leads to proper submission of evidences in court of law. =Forensic ornithology= Bird remains can be identified, first and foremost from feathers (which are distinctive to a particular species at both macroscopic and microscopic levels). =Forensic odontology= Odontologists or dentists can be used in order to aid in an identification of degraded remains. Remains that have been buried for a long period or which have undergone fire damage often contain few clues to the identity of the individual. Tooth enamel, as the hardest substance in the human body, often endures and as such odontologists can in some circumstances compare recovered remains to dental records. =Forensic pathology= A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor who is an expert in both trauma and disease and is responsible for performing autopsies. He/she applies their extensive knowledge of the human body and possible internal and external inflictions as he/she performs an autopsy, to hopefully ascertain the manner and cause of death. Information derived from the autopsy often greatly assists investigative efforts as well as scene reconstruction. =Forensic toxicology= Forensic toxicology is the use of toxicology and other disciplines such as analytical chemistry, pharmacology and clinical chemistry to aid medical or legal investigation of death, poisoning, and drug use. The primary concern for forensic toxicology is not the legal outcome of the toxicological investigation or the technology utilized, but rather the obtainment and interpretation of results.  Forensic microbiology  With recent advances in massive parallel sequencing (MPS), or next-generation sequencing (NGS), forensic microbiology has become an increasingly promising area of research. ‚ÄúInitial applications in circumstances of biocrime, bioterrorism and epidemiology are now accompanied by the prospect of using microorganisms (i) as ancillary evidence in criminal cases; (ii) to clarify causes of death (e.g., drownings, toxicology, hospital-acquired infections, sudden infant death and shaken baby syndromes); (iii) to assist human identification (skin, hair and body fluid microbiomes); (iv) for geolocation (soil microbiome or microbiome of bodies of water); and (v) to estimate postmortem interval (thanatomicrobiome and epinecrotic microbial community)‚Äù.Oliveira, M. & Amorim, A.

Additionally, the analysis of the thanatomicrobiome may help to estimate the post-mortem interval.‚Äù.Fern√°ndez- Rodr√≠guez, A.,1 J.L.Burton2 L.Andreoletti3 J.Alberola4 P.Fornes5 I.Merino67 M.J.Mart√≠nez89 P.Castillo810 B.Sampaio-Maia11 I.M.Caldas12 V.Saegeman13 M.C.Cohen14 ESGFOR and the ESP.

One such group has made extensive headway into describing such a microbial clock, and ‚Äúbelieves she‚Äôs within two to five years of testing her clock in a real crime scene scenario‚Äù.Beans, Carolyn. News Feature: Can microbes keep time for forensic investigators? Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Jan 2; 115(1): 3‚Äì6. However, if a reliable and consistent microbial clock is determined to exist, ‚Äúit‚Äôs too soon to know whether the microbial clock will pass scientific and legal muster,‚Äù (Beans) and ‚Äúa judge would also have to determine that the microbial clock meets the standard for admission of expert testimony‚Äù. = Water sample analysis = In cases involving a body of water at or near the scene of a crime, a sample of the water can be extracted and analyzed under a light microscope for microorganisms. One such microorganism that are analyzed within samples of fresh water are diatoms, microscopic algae of varying shapes. Different bodies of water have been found to contain unique sets of diatoms and therefore, a piece of evidence found in a specific body of water will contain unique diatoms on it found only in that specific body of water. Therefore, the diatoms on a questioned object or body can be compared to the diatoms from a body of water to determine whether it had been present in the water.  Current issues  = Sexual assault kit backlog = Prior to DNA testing, many sexual assault cases could only rely on \\"he said, she said\\" and possible witnesses. Even once DNA analysis was available, many sexual assault kits, or SAKs, were never tested and thrown into a backroom or storage facility, only to be forgotten about until discovered. Now that DNA analysis is frequently utilized in the majority of cases, most SAKs are examined and analyzed. However, the issue remains about the preexisting SAKs that have never been tested. A prevalent issue then, that still extends to now, is the absence of funds to actually process and analyze these SAKs. Many districts would dedicate their funds to homicides or more high-profile cases and sexual assaults would be swept to the side. The biggest concern about all of these SAKs, is how to go about processing all of them, especially as more and more are being found each year. = Cold cases = With the considerable amount of advances in DNA analysis, old, open cases that still have intact evidence can be examined for biological evidence. New profiles are uploaded to CODIS everyday so the base population to search and compare to increases. Biological testing for cold cases, specifically homicides, encounter similar roadblocks as the SAKs - lack of funds or the DNA samples have not been properly stored thus too much degradation has occurred for viable analyses. Popular culture In popular culture, forensic biology is frequently portrayed in shows like Law & Order, Bones, CSI, Dexter and Castle. However thanks to Hollywood's depiction of forensic science, the analysis of biological evidence has fallen prey to the CSI Effect, which results in the public's perception of its capabilities being severely distorted and its limits blurred.

Life  Akhundzade was born in 1812 in Nukha (present-day Shaki, Azerbaijan) to a wealthy landowning family from Iranian Azerbaijan. He was ethnically an Azerbaijani.[Russian Azerbaijan (1905‚Äì1920): the shaping of a national identity in a Muslim community. Cambridge University Press, Boston, 1985.

According to his own autobiographical account (first published in Ka≈°k≈´l, Baku, 1887, nos. 43‚Äì45, and reprinted in M. F. Akhundov, AlefbƒÅ-ye «∞adƒ´d va makt≈´bƒÅt, ed. H. Mo·∏•ammadzƒÅda and ·∏§. ƒÄrƒÅslƒ´, Baku, 1963, pp. 349‚Äì55), ƒÄ·∏µ≈´ndzƒÅda was born in 1812 (other documents give 1811 and 1814) in the town of N≈´·∏µa, in the part of Azerbaijan that was annexed by Russia in 1828. His father, Mƒ´rzƒÅ Mo·∏•ammad-Taqƒ´, had been kad·∏µodƒÅ of ·∏¥ƒÅmena, a small town about fifty kilometers to the west of Tabrƒ´z, but he later turned to trade and, crossing the Aras river, settled in N≈´·∏µa, where in 1811 he took a second wife. One year later, she gave birth to Mƒ´rzƒÅ Fat·∏•- øAlƒ´. ƒÄ·∏µ≈´ndzƒÅda‚Äôs mother was descended from an African who had been in the service of NƒÅder Shah, and consciousness of this African element in his ancestry served to give ƒÄ·∏µ≈´ndzƒÅda a feeling of affinity with his great Russian contemporary, Pushkin. His parents, and especially his uncle Haji Alaskar, who was Fatali's first teacher, prepared young Fatali for a career in Shi'a clergy, but the young man was attracted to the literature. In 1832, while in Ganja, Akhundzade came into contact with the poet Mirza Shafi Vazeh, who introduced him to Western secular thought and discouraged him from pursuing a religious career. Later in 1834 Akhundzade moved to Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi, Georgia), and spent the rest of his life working as a translator of Oriental languages in the service of the Russian Empire's Viceroyalty. Concurrently, from 1837 onwards he worked as a teacher in Tbilisi uezd Armenian school, then in Nersisyan school. In Tiflis his acquaintance and friendship with the exiled Russian Decembrists Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, Vladimir Odoyevsky, poet Yakov Polonsky, Armenian writers Khachatur Abovian, Gabriel Sundukyan and others played some part in the formation of Akhundzade's Europeanized outlook. Grave monument of Akhundzade in Tbilisi Akhundzade's first published work was The Oriental Poem (1837), written to lament the death of the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. But the rise of Akhundzade's literary activity comes in the 1850s. In the first half of the 1850s, Akhundzade wrote six comedies ‚Äì the first comedies in Azerbaijani literature as well as the first samples of the national dramaturgy. The comedies by Akhundzade are unique in their critical pathos, analysis of the realities in Azerbaijan of the first half of the 19th century. These comedies found numerous responses in the Russian other foreign periodical press. The German Magazine of Foreign Literature called Akhundzade \\"dramatic genius\\", \\"the Azerbaijani Moli√®re\\" 1. Akhundzade's sharp pen was directed against everything that he believed hindered the advance of the Russian Empire, which for Akhundzadeh was a force for modernisation, in spite of the atrocities it committed in its southern advance against Akhundzadeh's own kin. According to Walter Kolarz: > The greatest Azerbaidzhani poet of the nineteenth century, Mirza Fathali > Akhundov (1812-78), who is called the \\"Moli√®re of the Orient\\", was so > completely devoted to the Russian cause that he urged his compatriots to > fight Turkey during the Crimean War.Kolarz W. Russian and Her Colonies. > London. 1953. pp 244‚Äì245 In 1859 Akhundzade published his short but famous novel The Deceived Stars. In this novel he laid the foundation of Azerbaijani realistic historical prose, giving the models of a new genre in Azerbaijani literature. By his comedies and dramas, Akhundzade established realism as the leading trend in Azerbaijani literature. According to Ronald Grigor Suny: > Turkish nationalism, which developed in part as a reaction to the > nationalism of the Christian minorities [of the Ottoman Empire], was, like > Armenian nationalism, heavily influenced by thinkers who lived and were > educated in the Russian Empire. The Crimean Tatar Ismail Bey Gasprinski and > the Azerbaijani writer Mirza Fath Ali Akhundzade inspired Turkish > intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Ronald > Grigor Suny Looking Toward Ararat: Armenia in Modern History.

Reza Zia-Ebrahimi too considers Akhundzade as the founding father of what he calls 'dislocative nationalism' in Iran. According to Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade found inspiration in Orientalist templates to construct a vision of ancient Iran, which offered intellectuals disgruntled with the pace of modernist reform in Iran, a self-serving narrative where all of Iran's shortcomings are blamed on a monolithic and otherized 'other': the Arab. For Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade must be credit with the introduction of ethno-racial ideas, particularly the opposition between the Iranian Aryan and the Arab Semite, into Iran's intellectual debates. Zia-Ebrahimi disputes that Akhundzade had any influence on modernist intellectuals such as Malkum Khan (beyond a common project to reform the Alphabet used to write Persian) or Talibov Tabrizi. His real heir was Kermani, and these two intellectuals' legacy is to be found in the ethnic nationalism of the Pahlavi state, rather than the civic nationalism of the Constitutional movement. In the 1920s, the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre was named after Akhundzade.  Iranian nationalism  Akhundzade identified himself as belonging to the nation of Iran (mellat-e IrƒÅn) and to the Iranian homeland (va·π≠an). He corresponded with JƒÅlƒÅl-al-Din MirzƒÅ (a minor Qajar prince, son of Bahman Mirza Qajar,1826‚Äì70) and admired this latter's epic NƒÅmeh-ye KhosrovƒÅn ('Book of Sovereigns'), which was an attempt to offer the modern reader biography of Iran's ancient kings, real and mythical, without recourse to any Arabic loanword. The NƒÅmeh presented the pre-Islamic past as one of grandeur, and the advent of Islam as a radical rupture. For Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade is the founder of what he refers to as 'dislocative nationalism'. Zia-Ebrahimi defines dislocative nationalism as 'an operation that takes place in the realm of the imagination, an operation whereby the Iranian nation is dislodged from its empirical reality as a majority-Muslim society situated ‚Äì broadly ‚Äì in the \\"East\\". Iran is presented as an Aryan nation adrift, by accident, as it were, from the rest of its fellow Aryans (read: Europeans).' Dislocative nationalism is thus predicated on more than a total distinction between supposedly Aryan Iranians and Semitic Arabs, as it is suggested that the two races are incompatible and in opposition to each other. These ideas are directly indebted to nineteenth- century racial thought, particularly the Aryan race hypothesis developed by European comparative philologists (a hypothesis that Zia-Ebrahimi discusses at length ). Dislocative nationalism presents the pre-Islamic past as the site of a timeless Iranian essence, dismisses the Islamic period as one of decay, and blames all of Iran's shortcomings in the nineteenth and later twentieth century on Arabs and the adoption of Islam. The advent of Islam is thus ethnicised into an 'Arab invasion' and perceived as a case of racial contamination or miscegenation. According to Zia-Ebrahimi, dislocative nationalism does not, in itself, offer a blueprint for reforming the state beyond calls to eliminate what it arbitrarily defines as the legacy of Arabs: Islam and Arabic loanwords. Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani (1854‚Äì96) was one of Akhundzades disciples, and three decades later will endeavour to disseminate Akhundzade's thought while also significantly strengthening its racial content (Zia-Ebrahimi argues that Kermani was the first to retrieve the idea of 'the Aryan race' from European texts and refer to it as such, the modern idea of race here being different to the various cognates of the term 'Ariya' that one finds in ancient sources). Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani also followed JalƒÅl-al-Din MirzƒÅ in producing a national history of Iran, ƒÄ æine-ye sekandari (The Alexandrian Mirror), extending from the mythological past to the Qajar era, again to contrast a mythified and fantasised pre-Islamic past with a present that falls short of nationalist expectations. Zia-Ebrahimi sees dislocative nationalism as the dominant paradigm of identity in modern Iran, as it became part and parcel of the official ideology of the Pahlavi State (1925‚Äì79) and thus disseminated through mass-schooling, propaganda, and the state's symbolic repertoire.  Alphabet reform  Well ahead of his time, Akhundzade was a keen advocate for alphabet reform, recognizing deficiencies of Perso-Arabic script with regards to Turkic sounds. He began his work regarding alphabet reform in 1850. His first efforts focused on modifying the Perso-Arabic script so that it would more adequately satisfy the phonetic requirements of the Azerbaijani language. First, he insisted that each sound be represented by a separate symbol ‚Äì no duplications or omissions. The Perso-Arabic script expresses only three vowel sounds, whereas Azeri needs to identify nine vowels. Later, he openly advocated the change from Perso-Arabic to a modified Latin alphabet. The Latin script which was used in Azerbaijan between 1922 and 1939, and the Latin script which is used now, were based on Akhundzade's third version.  Family  His parents' was Mirza Mahammad Taghi (born in Khamaneh) and Nane khanum. He married to Tubu Khanum, his mother's cousin in 1842. He had 13 children of whom only 2 (Nisa and Rashid) reached maturity. His second marriage was to Nazli Beyim, a descendant of Javad Khan, with whom he fathered Sayrabayim. He married off both Nisa and Sayrabayim to Khan Baba Mirza from Bahmani family. His grandson Fatali was purged in 1938. Legacy Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater named after Akhundov Beside of his role in Azerbaijani literature and Iranian nationalism, Akhundzadeh was also known for his harsh criticisms of religions (mainly Islam) and stays as the most iconic Azerbaijani atheist.–ê—Ö—É–Ω–¥–æ–≤ –ú. –§. ‚Äì –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–µ –ª—é–¥–∏ ‚Äì –ê—Ç–µ–∏—Å—Ç—ã National Library of Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre as well as a couple of streets, parks and libraries are also named after Akhundzade in Azerbaijan.

The Erma passes close to the villages of Glavanovtsi and Turokovtsi, where it turns north, running through Tran. After Tran, the Erma cut the famous gorge Transko zhdrelo (\\"Gorge of Tran\\"). After the gorge, Erma flows through the Bulgarian part of the village of Petaƒçinci.

It is a bicameral body, comprising the lower house, the Louisiana House of Representatives with 105 representatives, and the upper house, the Louisiana Senate with 39 senators. Members of each house are elected from single-member districts of roughly equal populations. The State Legislature meets in the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. Terms Members of both houses of the legislature serve a four-year term, with a term limit of three terms (twelve years). Term limits were passed by state voters in a constitutional referendum in 1995 and were subsequently added as Article III, ¬ß4, of the Louisiana Constitution. In 2007, some legislators had served their maximum terms and could not run again, being \\"termed out of office\\". The term limits are consecutive rather than lifetime. Officers The officers of each house of the Legislature are elected at the beginning of each term to serve for four-year terms. The Louisiana House of Representatives elects from among its members a Speaker and speaker pro tempore. Although the procedure is not mandated constitutionally, the speaker of the House is traditionally recommended by the governor of Louisiana to the body. The current speaker, Taylor Barras, a Republican, presides over the House. The House also elects its chief clerical officer, the clerk of the House, who is not an elected member. The Louisiana Senate elects its presiding officer, the President of the Senate, from among its membership; the position is also traditionally recommended by the governor. The current President is John Alario. Each house provides for the election of its officers. From 1853 until the adoption of the Louisiana constitution of 1974, the Lieutenant Governor was designated to preside over the Louisiana Senate. In the 21st century, the Lieutenant Governor exercises powers delegated to him by the Governor as provided by law. He also serves as governor in the event of a vacancy in the office, if the Governor is unable to act as governor, or is out of the state. Since the Lieutenant Governor no longer serves as president of the Senate, he has been made an ex-officio member of each committee, board and commission on which the Governor serves. (Louisiana Constitution Article IV, Section 6) Additionally, the Lieutenant Governor serves as head of the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. Sessions and quorum In even-numbered years, a state legislature convenes at noon on the last Monday in March to extend for no longer than 60 legislative days during a period of 85 days. In odd-numbered years, a limited jurisdiction session convenes at noon on the last Monday in April for no longer than 45 legislative days during a period of 60 days. The legislature also may convene for extraordinary sessions and for veto sessions. The legislature is required to meet in an organizational session, which cannot exceed three days, on the date its members take office. A special session may be called by the Governor or may be convened by the presiding officers of both houses upon a written petition of a majority of the elected members of each house. A special session is limited to the number of days stated in the proclamation, not to exceed 30 days. The power to legislate in a special session is limited to the objects specifically enumerated in the proclamation. In order to constitute a quorum, both houses require a majority of members present; 53 members of the House of Representatives and 20 members of the Senate. A smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may compel the attendance of absent members. Each house is required to also keep a journal of its proceedings and have it published immediately after the close of each session. Political immunity Members of both houses of the State Legislature are free from arrest, except for felony, during their attendance at sessions and committee meetings of their house and while going to and from them. No member shall be questioned elsewhere for any speech in either house. Veto powers The Governor of Louisiana carries the power of the line-item veto. However, the legislature has the constitutional power to override a gubernatorial veto by a vote of two-thirds from each house.

In 1988, it merged with American publisher Eternity Comics, itself an imprint of Malibu Comics, and in the late 1980s was taken over by Malibu before ceasing publication. It was the original publisher of The Men in Black, the 1990 comic book on which the Men In Black film series was based. Aircel blended historical and futuristic fantasy from different cultures as the underlying theme for each comic series. It featured high-quality colour covers with black-and white interiors. Canadian artists such as Dave Cooper, Denis Beauvais, and Dale Keown got their start at Aircel. Charles de Lint also scripted several comic books for Aircel in the mid-1980s.  Company history  Aircel was originally a manufacturer of foam insulation. When the government discontinued its contract with the company, employee Barry Blair convinced the owner to shift the company's focus to comic book publishing, which was experiencing a boom.Munn, Bryan. \\"Barry Blair, 1959-2010,\\" Sequential: Canadian Comix News & Culture (Jan. 5, 2010). Blair ran the publishing operations, and Aircel's initial talent line-up included him, Dave Cooper, Patrick McEown, and Guang Yap. Aircel released its first books in 1985: Samurai, Dragonring, and Elflord, all of which featured line art in a style borrowed from manga, which was fairly new to the North American market. In 1986, illustrator Denis Beauvais and writer Gordon Derry collaborated with Blair to create Warlock 5, which featured realistic mixed-media and airbrushing techniques. The Maelstrom series was released shortly thereafter. In the late 1980s, the independent comics market contracted, hurting niche publishers such as Aircel. Blair struck a deal with Scott Mitchell Rosenberg of Malibu Comics in which the larger publisher would be \\"lent\\" Aircel to publish a number of titles, in return for financial assistance. This resulted in a de facto merger with the Malibu imprint Eternity Comics.\\"Eternity Merges with Aircel,\\" The Comics Journal #125 (November 1, 1988), p. 19. New illustrators assumed responsibility for continuing some of the existing series (e.g. Elford vol. 2, Warlock 5 vol. 2), which led to ownership disputes over some of these titles.\\"Eternity/Aircel Adventure,\\" The Comics Journal #138 (October 1990), p. 19. Ultimately, Aircel terminated most of its previous titles and pursued erotic-themed comics with Malibu. In 1990, Aircel published the series The Men in Black, by Lowell Cunningham and Sandy Carruthers. In 1992 the series was optioned by producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald, who developed the idea into the film Men In Black, which became the basis for a film and TV franchise. In 1991, Aircel's debts were paid off, and Blair quit Aircel, formally handing the company over to Malibu.\\"Newswatch: Barry Blair Ends Malibu Contract, Starts Own Firm,\\" The Comics Journal #144 (September 1991), p. 7.

It is part of the Buffalo Public Schools system. The school was founded in 1975 for academically gifted and talented high school students by three faculty members from Bennett High School and Clinton Junior High School. In 1975, it was born as a school-within-a-school program, and in one year it became a school of its own. It is located in the historic Fosdick-Masten Park High School, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Today, the school curriculum includes Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses as well as Regents courses required by New York State Education Department. Currently 885 students from grades 5-12 attend the school. In 2014, The Washington Post ranked City Honors as the most challenging high school in the northeast, based on the number of college level exams taken per graduate.High School Challenge Washington Post  History  School 8 School 56 City Honors began as a series of enrichment topics at Bennett High School in 1973, known as \\"Course Y\\". Selected students took classes in the evening that dealt with enrichment courses and interdisciplinary topics. Increased student demand led to these workshops becoming a \\"school-within-a-school\\" at Bennett beginning in 1975, with a partnership being forged with nearby Canisius College. In 1976, City Honors landed its own building, the former P.S. 17 located at the corner of Main and Delavan, which would allow the school to add grades 5 through 8 and strengthen its affiliation with Canisius. This made City Honors one of the first magnet elementary schools in the district. The school eventually moved to its current location at the Fosdick-Masten Park High School building in 1980. In 1991, City Honors adopted the International Baccalaureate program.LaChiusa, C. (2000, May). A Brief History of City Honors High School From 2007 to 2009, the Masten/Fosdick location underwent a $40 million expansion and renovation project that included a new athletic complex. During that time, grades 5-8 were temporarily housed at School 56, and grades 9-12 at School 8.Simon, P. (2007, October 27). City Honors sets rise in security after attacks. The Buffalo News, p.

This test can be taken in the November before the next school year. There are multiple testing days throughout the month. For example, to enter as a 5th grade student, the test must be taken in the student's 4th grade year. City Honors currently offers Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses to its high school students. The IB program was adopted in 1991. IB coursesinclude English A1 HL (Higher Level), Language B SL (French, Spanish or Mandarin) (Standard Level), Economics SL, History of the Americas HL, Biology SL/HL, Physics SL/HL, Business and Management SL, Mathematics SL, Mathematics Studies SL, Film HL, Visual Arts HL, and Theory of Knowledge (ToK). The school was authorized as a Middle Years Program (MYP) school in summer 2008. This brought the IB program to grades 5-10 as well. At a minimum, all juniors and seniors take two years of IB English; this is a requirement to graduate from City Honors School and can bring college credit if a student does well enough in the course. AP Exams offered at City Honors include English Language and Comp, English Literature (taken by all sophomores), World History (taken by all sophomores), U.S. History (taken by all juniors), Calculus, Statistics, Biology, Physics, Environmental Science, French, Spanish, Chinese, Art History, Geography, Music Theory, and Studio Art. All students must take AP Literature and AP World History in 10th grade and AP U.S. History and Government in 11th grade. Beginning with the 2018-2019 school year, City Honors School and the Board of Education decided to implement AP English Language and Composition instead of AP Literature and Composition sophomore year. This was widely accepted by students, teachers, and parents. 2007 human remains found In anticipation of the school reconstruction project, workers dug exploratory shafts in December 2007. This was done because the school building had been built on the site of an old potter's field and there was concern that not all remains had been moved when the school was originally built. Crews found the skeletal remains of two adults and one infant. At that time, those remains were moved to Forest Lawn Cemetery. In May 2008, digging resumed and many more human remains were found. All remains in the reconstruction areas have been removed. They were examined at Utica College and were sent to Forest Lawn for re- interment.

As Barry's real estate holdings in Hudson County grew throughout the 1980s, the organization bought a chain of local newspapers and consolidated them into a coordinated weekly paper group. In 1995 the chain moved to a large, historic bank building at 1400 Washington Street, across the street from the basement office. Lucha Malato joined the company in 1983 and David Unger in 1985. both becoming his minority partners. In 1987, the chain began The Secaucus Reporter.

The consolidation of the staff at the new location also saw the closing of the small satellite office in Bayonne that published the Bayonne Community News for years.

Among the most notable elements of the federal budget were its reduction of the Goods and Services Tax by one percentage point, income tax cuts for middle-income earners, and $1,200-per-child childcare payment (the \\"Universal Child Care Benefit\\") for Canadian parents. Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the bill an indication of what Canadians should expect from his Conservative minority government. Many aspects of the bill were criticized by opposition parties. The Liberal Party and New Democratic Party indicated that they would not support the budget, while the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois indicated that it would vote in favour of it. On June 6, 2006, the budget was introduced for a third reading in the House of Commons. Amid an apparent mix-up, no Members of Parliament rose to speak. Thus, the budget was declared passed by unanimous consent a week ahead of schedule.Federal budget passes unopposed on mix-up from CBC NewsThe proceedings from June 6th included some confused comments by MPs and clarifications by Deputy Speaker Bill Blaikie confirming that the Bill C13 had been passed: \\"Order, please. There seems to be some confusion in the House. It is my understanding that the bill to which the hon. member is speaking is Bill C-13 which was just passed. We have now moved to debate on Bill C-10.\\" \\"It may have been the intention of some members [to debate a third reading] but before I took the Chair I observed what I thought to be the passage of Bill C-13 without any dissent, or division for that matter. I believe the matter has now been decided.\\" \\"The Speaker did call for debate when the question was put on third reading and no one rose. The question was then put on third reading and the bill was carried without dissent or division. It sometimes happens in the House that the intentions people have do not always fully manifest themselves.\\" quoted from OpenParliament.ca recorded proceedings Highlights Initiatives to be delivered over periods ranging from one to five years: *$1.1 billion for the Canadian Forces. *$2 billion in general spending cuts. *The creation of the Canada Employment Credit, a tax credit to be worth approximately $155 per employed Canadian by 2007. *$1 billion for emergency preparedness, specifically against a potential flu pandemic. *A decrease (in law) in the lowest income tax rate from 16% to 15.25% for 2006, and then to 15.5% for subsequent years.Bill C-80, introduced by the Liberal government six days before the dissolution of the 38th Parliament, proposed to decrease the lowest income tax rate from 16% to 15% and increase the personally basic amount by $500 effective January 2005. This bill only passed the first reading and was not law . According to convention, changes to tax laws are implemented as soon as announced by the government, even if applicable legislation has not yet been passed through Parliament. Thus, the Canada Revenue Agency implemented the changes while parliament was dissolved. *Increases to the amount that an individual can earn before paying personal income tax from about $8,300 to $10,000 by 2010. *A reduction of the general corporate income tax rate from 21% in 2007 to 19% in 2010, and elimination of the 3% corporate income surtax after 2006. *$160 million for hiring new police officers at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. *$3 billion to reduce the government's debt. *No funding for the Kyoto Protocol. *No funding for the Kelowna Accord. *$150 million in new taxes on income trusts. =Goods and Services Tax cut= The Conservative government promised to lower the federal Goods and Services Tax from 7% to 6% in its first budget and to lower it to 5% by 2011. During the 2006 election campaign, the Martin government proposed income tax cuts for lower-middle-income earners. The Liberals claimed that the GST cut would effectively result in a tax increase for those in the lower-middle-income bracket. The Conservatives argued that the GST cuts would benefit all Canadians, including low-income earners and those outside the workforce who do not pay income tax. The first GST cut went into effect on July 1, 2006, and no provinces have raised provincial sales tax as a demonstrable result. Nova Scotia raised the provincial sales tax 2 points as part of deficit-fighting measures under the Dexter government; this was put in place on July 1, 2010. The second cut was later announced in the 2007 Throne Speech and officially confirmed on October 30, 2007 during an economic statement update on the country finances. Reception The budget was met with dissent by the Liberal and New Democratic parties and mostly positive reception from the Bloc. The Liberals and NDP voiced disapproval over the Conservatives following through on their election promise to replace the Liberals' child care policy with their own, and for replacing Canada's $4 billion environmental policy with a $2 billion \\"made in Canada\\" plan of their design. The budget received widespread support among the business community and polling indicated that a clear majority of Canadians approved of the budget. Vote While it initially appeared that the only way the Conservatives' budget would pass would be with the support of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, the budget passed third reading without dissent on June 6, 2006, when the members of the Opposition failed to stand after the Deputy Speaker of the House called for debate. Because there were no speakers for the Opposition, the budget was declared passed with unanimous support and no recorded vote and thus forwarded to the Senate for approval. This marked the first time in Canadian Parliamentary history where a government's budget passed unanimously on the third and final reading. On September 25, 2006, the Conservative government announced that within the fiscal year, there was a $13.2 billion surplus that will be used to pay down the country's debt.CTV Story - Paying Canada's Debt Income Trusts Controversy Economist Yves Fortin challenged the reasons for the change in tax regime announced by Flaherty and disputed the Harper-government assertion that the Trust structure led to a loss of tax revenue because of trust conversions in his research paper. Income Trusts and Tax Leakage: Is there a problem? Analyst Gordon Tait also raised concerns about the lack of consultation and misconceptions surrounding the change in tax policy on Trusts in The Inconvenient Truth About Trusts. Analyst Cameron Renkas refuted the Department of Finance's assertion that the United States and Australia took action to shut down flow-through structures. In his research paper, Digging Deeper, he gave a perspective on how the United States taxes publicly traded flow-through entities and Master limited partnerships, the US equivalent of Canadian Income Trusts. In a January 12, 2007 paper, Yves Fortin outlined his concerns regarding the claim of tax leakage. In his October 31, 2006 policy statement, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said, \\"If left unchecked, these corporate decisions would result in billions of dollars in less tax revenue for the federal government to invest in the priorities of Canadians, including more personal income tax relief\\" but Minister Flaherty did not document his allegation or cite any research to back up his claim. Mr. Fortin's paper A Recipe For Tax Loss gave several examples of how the tax on income trusts could lead to a loss in government tax revenue, not a gain. Analyst Dirk Lever wrote on January 15, 2007, \\"We cannot understand why any Canadians would support double taxation of retirement benefits - it affects all of us eventually.\\" Mr. Lever also cited several flaws in the Conservative government's policy in his research paper Deep Dive into Tax Issues: Canadian Pensioners Taxed Twice on Canadian Corporate Dividends. In the report, Mr. Lever asked: * Why are Canadian Pension Benefits are taxed twice on Canadian Corporate Dividends? * Why are foreign investors allowed more favorable tax treatment than Canadian retail investors? Special hearings by the Finance Committee commenced January 30, 2007. John McCallum, the Liberal Finance critic called on Minister Flaherty to explain the reasoning behind the change in Income Trust Tax policy. In a February 8, 2007 news release, John McCallum is quoted as saying, \\"essentially they released close to a thousand pages of public documents, not one of which brings Canadians any closer to understanding what type of information or calculations led the Minister to break his election promise and tax income trusts, either the Minister is in contempt of the committee‚Äôs motion or he had absolutely no data from his own department before shutting down the sector and destroying tens of thousands of Canadians‚Äô life savings. The first possibility is disturbing, the second is deplorable.\\" The Conservatives had the support of the Jack Layton and the NDP on this issue. The government postponed the tax from taking effect until 2011 for existing trusts. The government argued that it could now allow giant corporations to convert as proposed by BCE for its Bell Canada subsidiary, \\"...a move that would save it $800 million in tax by 2008.\\" Subsequent to the October 31 announcement by Flaherty, the TSX Capped Energy Trust Index lost 21.8% in market value and the TSX Capped Income Trust Index lost 17.6% in market value by mid November 2006. In contrast, the TSX Capped REIT Index, which is exempt from the \\"Tax Fairness Plan,\\" gained 3.2% in market value. According to the Canadian Association of Income Funds, this translated into a permanent loss in savings of $30 billion to Canadian Income Trust Investors . Harper later mentioned that this was \\"the toughest decision for the government.\\" The Canadian Press voted the Harper Government and Jim Flaherty \\"Business Newsmaker of 2006\\" for the announcement to tax Income Trusts on Halloween. In a July 9, 2007 interview on Business News Network, former Conservative Alberta Premier Ralph Klein criticized PM Stephen Harper and Finance Minister Jim Flaherty for their mishandling of the Income Trust issue and for not keeping their word on Income Trust taxation. According to the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors, the change in tax rules cost investors $35 billion in market value. Stephen Harper specifically promised \\"not to raid Senior's nest eggs\\" during the 2006 Federal Election.

He was the only Republican elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He championed the typical Republican causes of his day, namely equal rights for African-Americans and the use of force to quell violence. Morrow had been schooled in his party's principles by his father, Thomas Z. Morrow, who was its candidate for governor in 1883, and his uncle, William O. Bradley, who was elected governor in 1895. Both men were founding members of the Republican Party in Kentucky. After rendering non-combat service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Morrow graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 1902 and opened his practice in Lexington, Kentucky. He made a name for himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal of a black man who had been charged with murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony. He was appointed U.S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky by President William Howard Taft in 1910 and served until he was removed from office in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson. In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history. Morrow ran for governor again in 1919. His opponent, James D. Black, had ascended to the governorship earlier that year when Stanley resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. Morrow encouraged voters to \\"Right the Wrong of 1915\\" and ran on a progressive platform that included women's suffrage and quelling racial violence. He charged the Democratic administration with corruption, citing specific examples, and won the general election in a landslide. With a friendly legislature in 1920, he passed much of his agenda into law including an anti-lynching law and a reorganization of state government. He won national acclaim for preventing the lynching of a black prisoner in 1920. He was not hesitant to remove local officials who did not prevent or quell mob violence. By 1922, Democrats regained control of the General Assembly, and Morrow was not able to accomplish much in the second half of his term. Following his term as governor, he served on the United States Railroad Labor Board and the Railway Mediation Board, but never again held elected office. He died of a heart attack on June 15, 1935, while living with a cousin in Frankfort. Early life Morrow's house in Somerset Edwin Morrow was of Scottish descent and was born to Thomas Zanzinger and Virginia Catherine (Bradley) Morrow in Somerset, Kentucky, on November 28, 1877.Hay, p. 152\\"Kentucky Governor Edwin Porch Morrow\\". National Governors Association He and his twin brother, Charles, were the youngest of eight children.Jillson, p. 22 His father was one of the founders of the Republican Party in Kentucky and an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1883.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 655 His mother was a sister to William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky in 1895.Powell, p. 86 Morrow's great-grandfather Thomas Morrow emigrated to America from Scotland before the Revolutionary War. Morrow's early education was in the public schools of Somerset. At age 14, he entered preparatory school at St. Mary's College near Lebanon, Kentucky.Jillson, p. 24 He continued there throughout 1891 and 1892. From there, he enrolled at Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky, and distinguished himself in the debating society. He was also interested in sports, playing halfback on the football team and left field on the baseball team.Jillson, p. 25 On June 24, 1898, Morrow enlisted as a private in the 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Tapp, p. 376 He was first stationed at Lexington, Kentucky, and later trained at Anniston, Alabama.Jillson, p. 27 Due to a bout with typhoid fever, he never saw active duty, and mustered out as a second lieutenant on February 12, 1899.Cotterill in Dictionary of American Biography In 1900, he matriculated for the fall semester at the University of Cincinnati Law School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1902. Morrow opened his practice in Lexington. He established his reputation in one of his first cases--the trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial.Jillson, p. 30 Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed.Jillson, p. 31 Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902. Morrow returned to Somerset in 1903. There, he married Katherine Hale Waddle on June 18, 1903. Waddle's father had studied law under Morrow's father, and Edwin and Katherine had been playmates, schoolmates, and later sweethearts.Jillson, p. 33 The couple had two children, Edwina Haskell in July 1904 and Charles Robert in November 1908.Jillson, p. 34 Political career In 1904, Morrow was appointed city attorney for Somerset, serving until 1908. President William Howard Taft appointed him U.S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky in 1910. He continued in this position until he was removed from office by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913. William O. Bradley, Morrow's uncle, was elected governor of Kentucky in 1895. Morrow's first political experience was working in his uncle William O. Bradley's gubernatorial campaign in 1895. In 1899, Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor offered to make Morrow his Secretary of State in exchange for Bradley's support in the election; Bradley refused.Tapp, p. 425 Despite the encouragement of friends, Morrow declined to run for governor in 1911. In 1912, Morrow was chosen as the Republican candidate for the Senate seat of Thomas Paynter.Klotter, p. 220 Paynter had decided not to seek re-election, and the Democrats nominated Ollie M. James of Crittenden County. The General Assembly was heavily Democratic and united behind James. On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105‚Äì28. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment the next year, this was the last time the Kentucky legislature would elect a senator. At the state Republican convention in Lexington on June 15, 1915, Morrow was chosen as the Republican candidate for governor over Latt F. McLaughlin.Hay, p. 153Appleton, p. 32 His Democratic opponent was his close friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Morrow charged previous Democratic administrations with corruption and called for the election of a Republican because \\"You cannot clean house with a dirty broom.\\"Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 285 Both men ran on progressive platforms, and the election went in Stanley's favor by only 471 votes. Although it was the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history, Morrow refused to challenge the results, which greatly increased his popularity. His decision was influenced by the fact that a challenge would be decided by the General Assembly, which had a Democratic majority in both houses.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, pp. 285‚Äì286 =Governor of Kentucky= Morrow served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1916, 1920, and 1928. In 1919, he was chosen by acclamation as his party's candidate for governor. This time, his opponent was James D. Black. Black was Stanley's lieutenant governor and had ascended to the governorship in May 1919 when Stanley resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. Morrow encouraged the state's voters to \\"Right the Wrong of 1915\\".Klotter, p. 233 He again ran on a progressive platform, advocating an amendment to the state constitution to grant women's suffrage. His support was not as strong for a prohibition amendment. He attacked the Stanley‚ÄìBlack administration as corrupt. Days before the election, he exposed a contract awarded by the state Board of Control to a non-existent company. Historian Lowell H. Harrison argued that Black's refusal to remove the members of the board following this revelation probably sealed his defeat. Morrow won the general election by more than 40,000 votes. It was the largest margin of victory for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the state's history. Morrow signs the bill ratifying the 19th Amendment, Kentucky Equal Rights Association members look on in celebration, January 6, 1920. On January 6, 1920, Governor Morrow signed the bill ratifying the Nineteenth Amendment, making Kentucky the 23rd state to ratify it, and the moment is captured in a photograph with members of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association. During the 1920 legislative session, the Republicans held a majority in the state House of Representatives and were a minority by only two votes in the state Senate. During the session, Morrow was often able to convince C. W. Burton, a Democratic senator from Grant County, to support Republican proposals.Klotter, p. 267 Tie votes in the Senate were broken by Republican lieutenant governor S. Thruston Ballard. Consequently, Morrow was able to effect a considerable reorganization of the state government, including replacing the Board of Control with a nonpartisan Board of Charities and Corrections, centralizing highway works, and revising property taxes.Jillson, p. 56 He oversaw improvements to the education system, including better textbook selection and a tax on racetracks to support a minimum salary for teachers. Among Morrow's reforms that did not pass was a proposal to make the judiciary nonpartisan. Morrow urged enforcement of state laws against carrying concealed weapons and restricted activities of the Ku Klux Klan. During his first year in office, he granted only 100 pardons.Jillson, p. 61 This was a considerable decrease from the number granted by his immediate predecessors. During their first years in office, J. C. W. Beckham granted 350 pardons, James B. McCreary (during his second stint as governor) granted 139, and Augustus O. Stanley granted 257. He was also an active member of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, a society for the elimination of racial violence in the South.Wright, p. 12 A mob gathered outside the courthouse during the trial of Will Lockett in 1920. On February 9, 1920, Morrow dispatched the Kentucky National Guard to Lexington to protect Will Lockett, a black World War I veteran on trial for murder.Klotter, p. 69 Morrow told the state adjutant general \\"Do as much as you have to do to keep that negro in the hands of the law. If he falls into the hands of the mob I do not expect to see you alive.\\"Wright, p. 195 Lockett had already confessed, without the benefit of a lawyer, to the murder. His trial took only thirty minutes as he pleaded guilty but asked for a life sentence instead of death. Despite his plea, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair. A crowd of several thousand gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked a large group of those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 351 The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated.Wright, p. 196 The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon.Klotter, p. 70 Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville. The incident is believed to be the first forceful suppression of a lynch mob by state and local officials in the South. Morrow received a laudatory telegram from the NAACP, and most of the national press regarding the incident was favorable. W. E. B. Du Bois called it the \\"Second Battle of Lexington\\". Morrow was consistent in his use of state troops to end violence in the state. In 1922, he again dispatched the National Guard to quell a violent mill strike in Newport. Morrow also demanded consistency from local law enforcement officials. In 1921, he removed the Woodford County jailer from office because he allowed a black inmate to be lynched and offered a reward of $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.Hay, p. 154 Citizens of Versailles were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched.Wright, p. 203 The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged.Wright, pp. 203‚Äì204 Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.Wright, p. 204 In August 1922, a traveling salesman named Jack Eaton was arrested for allegedly assaulting several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured turpentine into his wounds. An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was a white man, blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence. Morrow was frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for vice president in 1920, but he withdrew his name from consideration, sticking to a campaign promise not to seek a higher office while governor. On July 27, 1920, he made a speech in Northampton, Massachusetts, officially notifying Calvin Coolidge of his nomination for that office. Although he supported Frank O. Lowden for president, the nomination went to Warren G. Harding, and Morrow campaigned vigorously on behalf of his party's ticket.Hay, pp. 154‚Äì155 In his address to the 1922 legislature, Morrow asked for for improvements to the state highway system and for the repeal of all laws denying equal rights to women. He also recommended a large bond issue to finance improvements to the state's universities, schools, prisons, and hospitals.Hay, p. 155 By this time, however, the Republicans had surrendered their majority in the state House, and practically all of Morrow's proposals were voted down. Morrow countered by vetoing several Democratic bills, including $700,000 in appropriations. Among the few accomplishments of the 1922 legislature were passage of an anti-lynching law, the abolition of convict labor and the establishment of normal schools at Murray and Morehead. Today, these schools are Murray State University and Morehead State University, respectively. The 1922 legislature also established a commission to govern My Old Kentucky Home State Park and approved construction of the Jefferson Davis Monument.Klotter, p. 268 Despite the fact that Morrow gained national praise for his handling of the Lockett trial, historian James C. Klotter opined that he \\"left behind a solid, and rather typical, record for a Kentucky governor.\\"Klotter, p. 275 He cited Morrow's fiscal conservatism and inability to control the legislature in 1922 as reasons for his lackluster assessment, although he praised Morrow's advancement of racial equality in the state. Morrow was prohibited by the state constitution from seeking a second consecutive term, and the achievements of his administration were not significant enough to ensure the election of Charles I. Dawson, his would-be Republican successor in the gubernatorial election of 1923. =Later career and death= Following his term as governor, Morrow retired to Somerset where he became active in the Watchmen of the Republic, an organization devoted to the eradication of prejudice and the promotion of tolerance. He served on the United States Railroad Labor Board from 1923 to 1926 and its successor, the Railway Mediation Board, from 1926 to 1934. He resigned to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives representing the Ninth District, but lost his party's nomination to John M. Robsion. Following his defeat in the congressional primary, Morrow made plans to return to Lexington to resume his law practice. On June 15, 1935, he died unexpectedly of a heart attack while temporarily living with a cousin in Frankfort. He is buried in Frankfort Cemetery.

It is based in Harley Street in London.  History  In 1952 and also on 9 November 1953 a group of dentists comprising Mr N L Newman BDS, Dr Malik, Mr Herbert Murray, Mr Peter Glazebrook, Mr Jonas and others The Probe Magazine August 1975 met in East London.Letter Brian Lux 28 April 2005 - on file In 1954 they formed the General Dental Practitioners Association in response to a perceived failure of the British Dental Association to lobby aggressively on behalf of general dental practitioners who had joined the National Health Service at its inception in 1948 only to see the first NHS patient charges imposed on dentures and successive cuts in dental fees. In those early days, the associate met in London, often at dental supply houses. Members included Mr Combiere, qualified in law, Herbert Murray the first treasurer, Frank Barlow, Hans Orlay (a pioneer of implants with titanium), Sidney Smith and Ian Simpson (the first GDPA member of the General Dental Council). Alan d'Arcy Fearn became President of both the GDPA and the BDA and the longest ever serving member of the GDC (35 years).  Structure  Until 2009 membership of the DPA was restricted to dentists in high-street practice. On 19 November 2009 it announced that membership would be opened to all dental care professionals registered with the General Dental Council or having an interest in primary dental care. Membership of the Association was expanded to include dental nurses, hygienists, therapists, technicians and the dental trade. As a trade union the DPA is subject to the full provisions of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 as amended, and must hold elections for the Chairman and Secretary and for membership of its principal executive committee, the Council.  Activity  The DPA's aims, contained in the Rules, are to represent members in the UK, to maintain the status of the profession, to improve its members' terms and conditions and to assist and provide services for members. It provides a podcast relevant to dentistry in the UK. Benefits include contracts and the industry-standard Private Fees and Wages Guide which is compiled from a survey of private fees charged by members. The DPA maintains contacts with government and others that enable it to provide a briefing service to help members reduce their business risk in the UK dental market. It also actively considers alternative dental treatment provision systems with the objective of promoting oral health in the UK. It gives evidence annually to the Review Body on Doctors and Dentists Remuneration on dentists' terms and conditions.  Magazine  Members receive a bimonthly magazine the GDP (formerly the General Dental Practitioner, formerly The Probe) (Identifier: ; BNB:GB8958084). This began as a newsletter in 1954 and was turned by Sol Chandler, an experienced Fleet Street journalist into a magazine, The Probe, in 1958. Ken Brown took over as Editor in 1964. In 1968 a contract was signed with Bouverie Press which saw the magazine expand to 56 pages in 1973. The magazine was purchased by Ken Brown in 1982. When the Probe name was sold to an independent publisher the GDPA magazine was relaunched as the General Dental Practitioner. The title was later abbreviated to the GDP with effect from vol. 8, no. 6 (July/Aug. 1996).

Some parts of the film were also directed by producer Joe D'Amato, uncredited.  Plot  After a small town nuclear power plant dumps hazardous waste into a forest surrounding the town, people begin dying in increasingly gruesome ways. No one can pinpoint the source of the deaths until the EPA investigates; the forests' roots were mutated due to the waste, causing them to kill and eat people. The plants attempt to break loose, however the EPA bulldozes the plants, killing them, but leaving the possibility that some plants may have survived.  Cast  *Mary Sellers as Josie *Jason Saucier as Matt *Bubba Reeves as Taylor *Chelsi Stahr as Susan *Vince O' Neil as Sheriff Production Production began at summer in 1990. Filming took place in Porterville, Utah, where Troll 2 was also filmed. Title clarification The Crawlers is also known by the titles Troll 3, Creepers and Contamination .7. Despite the Troll 3 title, the film has no narrative connections to Troll or Troll 2, the latter of which itself has no narrative connections to Troll. The Crawlers does not feature trolls, and does not share any cast members with either Troll film. It is also unconnected to the Italian science fiction horror film Contamination. D'Amato's fantasy film Quest for the Mighty Sword was released as Troll 3 in Germany, so these two films have been confused in some reference sources.  Distribution  Originally slated for theatrical release in the United States in 1990, the film ended up instead as a direct- to-video release (as The Crawlers) in 1993 by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. Scream Factory (under license from MGM Home Entertainment) released the film on DVD for the first time under the title Contamination .7, along with The Dungeonmaster, Catacombs and Cellar Dweller, in a 4 Horror Movie marathon collection on October 29, 2013.

Their names and descriptions have varied through time, dependent upon those who reflect their experience of contact with them. They are variously held to exist on higher planes of being or to be incarnate; if incarnate, they may be described as being gathered at some special location, such as Shambhala, or scattered through the world working anonymously. One early and influential source on these entities is Karl von Eckartshausen, whose The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, published in 1795, explained in some detail their character and motivations. Several 19th and 20th century occultists claimed to belong to or to have contacted these Secret Chiefs and made these communications known to others, including H.P. Blavatsky (who called them the \\"Tibetan Masters\\" or Mahatmas), C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey (who called them Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (who called them Ascended Masters), Aleister Crowley (who used the term to refer to members of the upper three grades of his order, A‚à¥A‚à¥), Dion Fortune (who called them the \\"esoteric order\\"), and Max Heindel (who called them the \\"Elder Brothers\\"). Sufism In certain esoteric teachings of Islam, there is said to be a cosmic spiritual hierarchyRenard, J: Historical Dictionary of Sufism, p 262 whose ranks include walis (saints, friends of God), abdals (changed ones), headed by a ghawth (helper) or qutb (pole, axis). The details vary according to the source. One source is the 12th Century Persian Ali Hujwiri. In his divine court, there are three hundred akhyƒÅr (\\"excellent ones\\"), forty abdƒÅl (\\"substitutes\\"), seven abrƒÅr (\\"piously devoted ones\\"), four awtƒÅd (\\"pillars\\"), three nuqabƒÅ (\\"leaders\\") and one qutb. > All these saints know one another and cannot act without mutual consent. It > is the task of the Awtad to go round the whole world every night, and if > there should be any place on which their eyes have not fallen, next day some > flaw will appear in that place, and they must then inform the Qutb in order > that he may direct his attention to the weak spot and that by his blessings > the imperfection may be remedied. Quoting The Mystics of Islam by Reynold A. > Nicholson Another is from Ibn Arabi, who lived in Moorish Spain. It has a more exclusive structure. There are eight nujabƒÅ (\\"nobles\\"), twelve nuqabƒÅ, seven abdƒÅl, four awtƒÅd, two a‚Äôimmah (\\"guides\\"), and the qutb. According to the 20th-century Sufi Inayat Khan, there are seven degrees in the hierarchy. In ascending order, they are pir, buzurg, wali, ghaus, qutb, nabi and rasul He does not say how the levels are populated. Pirs and buzurgs assist the spiritual progress of those who approach them. Walis may take responsibility for protecting a community and generally work in secret. Qutbs are similarly responsible for large regions. Nabis are charged with bringing a reforming message to nations or faiths, and hence have a public role. Rasuls likewise have a mission of transformation of the world at large.The Spiritual Hierarchy, from the Spiritual Message of Hazrat Inayat Khan Theosophy Helena Blavatsky's theosophy, a blend of Western Occultism and Asian religious philosophy, proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the Great White Brotherhood. Later offshoots of the Theosophical Society used the term Ascended master or Mahatma. In the Ascended Master Teachings, Ascended Master are believed to be spiritually enlightened beings who in past incarnations were ordinary humans, but who have undergone a series of spiritual transformations originally called initiations. Both \\"Mahatmas\\" and \\"Ascended Master\\" are terms used in the Ascended Master Teachings. Ascended Master is based on the Theosophical concept of the Mahatma or Master of the Ancient Wisdom. However, \\"Mahatmas\\" and \\"Ascended Masters\\" are believed by some to differ in certain respects. Occultism =The Golden Dawn= The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was founded by those claiming to be in communication with the Secret Chiefs. One of these Secret Chiefs was Anna Sprengel. Her name and address were decoded from the Cipher Manuscripts. =S.L. MacGregor Mathers= In 1892, Mathers was convinced that he had contacted these Secret Chiefs, and that this confirmed his position as head of the Golden Dawn.Wilson 1987, page 48 He declared this in a manifesto four years later saying that they were human and living on Earth, yet possessed terrible superhuman powers. He used this status to found the Second Order within the Golden Dawn,Wilson 1987, page 54 and to introduce the Adeptus Minor ritual.F. King 1978, page 17 =Aleister Crowley= While in Algeria in 1909, Crowley, along with Victor Neuburg, recited numerous Enochian Calls or Aires. After the fifteenth Aire, he was told that he had attained the grade of Magister Templi (Master of the Temple), which meant that he himself was now on the level of these Secret Chiefs, although this declaration caused many occultists to stop taking him seriously if they had not done so already.Wilson 1987, page 92F. King 1978, page 54 He also described this attainment as a possible and in fact a necessary step for all who truly followed his path.One Star in Sight, available at http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/aba/app2.html says the order in question \\"is composed of those who have crossed the Abyss...the two crises -- the Angel and the Abyss --- are necessary features in every career.\\" In 1947, when Aleister Crowley died, he left behind a sketch of one of the \\"Secret Chiefs\\", Crowley's invisible mentor that he called LAM. The sketch looks like a Grey Alien.Grant, Kenneth. Outside the Circles of Time. London: Frederick Muller Ltd., 1980 Fourth way and related teachings =G. I. Gurdjieff= The Graeco-Armenian G. I. Gurdjieff's teachings, known as the Fourth Way, mentioned a \\"Universal Brotherhood\\" and also a mysterious group of monks called the Sarmoung (also: Sarman, Sarmouni). Both groups were described as in possession of advanced knowledge and powers, and as being open to suitable candidates from all creeds. He also believed in advanced kinds of humans called \\"man number 6\\" and \\"man number seven\\", of whom he said: > They cannot perform actions opposed to their understanding or have an > understanding which is not expressed by actions. At the same time there can > be no discords among them, no differences of understanding. Therefore their > activity is entirely co-ordinated and leads to one common aim without any > kind of compulsion because it is based upon a common and identical > understanding. ...although he never explicitly linked \\"higher man\\" to his \\"brotherhoods\\".Gurdjieff, Bennett and the Fourth Way =J. G. Bennett= J. G. Bennett, was both a prominent student of Gurdjieff and an independent thinker. In his work The Dramatic Universe he speculated on a discarnate Hidden Directorate, or \\"Demiurgic intelligences\\". He later linked the Hidden Directorate with a historically attested lineage of Sufis, the Khwajagan. These theories, influenced by a Turkish Sufi called Hasan Shushud,Hasan Shushud at jgbennet.orgHasan Shushud at readingrumi.com were spelled out in his last book, Masters of Wisdom.Bennet's Masters of Wisdom on AmazonTranslation of Shushud's Masters of Wisdom =Idries Shah= The Afghan- Scottish teacher Idries Shah regarded himself as a Sufi, not a Fourth Way exponent, although he took on pupils from Bennett's, and other, Gurdjieff groups.Shah's interactions with Bennett at duversity.org He mentioned the Sarmoung or Sarman several times in his works. Shah also linked a number of Western initiatory groups such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons to Sufis. =Ernest Scott= In 1986, the journalist Edward Campbell wrote a book, The People of the Secret, under the pseudonym \\"Ernest Scott\\". The author, referring to a thesis first published by John G. Bennett in his work The Dramatic Universe in 1956, postulates that there is a \\"Hidden Directorate\\" influencing, guiding and intervening in humanity's destiny over the centuries. See the review The Sufis and Idries Shah in the book. According to the author, amongst those with links to the directorate are the Sufi and Sarmouni mystics. The work was published by the writer, thinker and Sufi teacher Idries Shah's Octagon Press. Contains an introduction by Colin Wilson.

It is also part of the Boring Lava Field, a group of volcanic vents and lava flows throughout Oregon and Washington state. The volcano erupted between 285,000 and 500,000 years ago. As part of the Boring Lava Field, Rocky Butte is considered an outlier of the Cascade Range. It was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the North American tectonic plate; it is the core remnant of intrusive rock from kilate Pleistocene volcano. The Butte has a calc-alkaline composition and consists of basaltic andesite with olivine phenocrysts. Historically, the mountain was the home of the Rocky Butte Jail, Judson Baptist College, and Hill Military Academy, as well as an extensive Works Progress Administration construction project; it is also currently the site of a still functioning but decommissioned aircraft beacon, Portland Bible College, and a campus for the City Bible Church. The slopes of Rocky Butte currently support Joseph Wood Hill Park and the Rocky Butte Natural Area, which includes a wide variety of flora and fauna and supports rich forest stands. Located next to Interstate 205, the Butte is a popular destination for hiking, climbing, and seeing mountains from its summit viewpoint.  Geography  Downtown Portland as seen from Rocky Butte Rocky Butte lies in the northeast part of Portland within the city limits, in Multnomah County, part of the U. S. state of Oregon. It is one of the few smaller volcanic cones within or near Portland, along with Mount Tabor, Kelly Butte, and Powell Butte. According to the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, Rocky Butte has an elevation of . It is surrounded on almost all sides by the Portland Delta. With a variable topography, the Portland area ranges from river valley floors to terraces reaching elevations of . The Willamette Valley is separated within by hills reaching heights more than , and it is also physically separated from the lower Columbia River valley. The Columbia River flows west from the eastern Portland region, merging with the Willamette near Portland before moving north. Tributaries for the Willamette include the Pudding, Molalla, Tualatin, Abernethy, and Clackamas Rivers, while the Washougal and Sandy Rivers mark notable tributaries for the Columbia River. The Columbia River has significantly shaped the geology of the area. Portland's climate is moderate, with long growing seasons, moderate rainfail, mild winters, and warm, dry summer seasons. The area typically does not experience frost, with more than 200 frost-free days annually. Temperature can vary widely, reaching a historic maximum of , though the usual July maximum is below , and the average minimum for January is above . Yearly, precipitation averages between in most river valleys, with a mean of from 1871 through 1952. It shows variability, however, with a historic low of at Portland in 1929 and a maximum of in 1882. More than 75 percent of this precipitation occurs between October and March; July and August mark the driest months with means below , while November, December, and January represent the wettest with averages greater than . Prevailing winds originate from the south during winter and from the northwest during the summer season, with the exception of prevailing winds at the mouth of the Columbia River Gorge, where winds predominantly move to the east. The southern winds have the highest velocities of the three, only rarely occurring with potentially destructive force.  Geology  Locations of Boring vents in the Portland, Oregon area, with Rocky Butte on the upper left center There are a number of volcanic centers within a radius of Troutdale and more than 32 vents within a radius of Kelly Butte. Mostly small cinder cone vents, these volcanoes also include some larger lava domes from shield volcanoes at Mount Sylvania, Highland Butte, and Larch Mountain. Known as the Boring Lava Field, this cluster includes more than 80 known small vents and associated lava flows, with more volcanic deposits likely present. The Global Volcanism Program reports that the field includes somewhere between 32 and 50 shield volcanoes and cinder cones, with many vents concentrated northwest of the town of Boring. Considered an outlier of the Cascade Range, the Boring Lava Field lies about to the west of the major Cascade crest. It marks one of five volcanic fields along the Quaternary Cascade arc, along with Indian Heaven, Tumalo in Oregon, the Mount Bachelor chain, and Caribou in California. Like the Cascade Range, the Boring field was also generated by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the North American tectonic plate, but it has a different tectonic position, with its eruptive activity more likely related to tectonic rifting throughout the region. The Boring Lava Field has erupted material derived from hot mantle magma, and the subducting Juan de Fuca plate may be as shallow as in depth at their location. Many volcanic features in the Portland Basin area were destroyed by the Missoula Floods (also known as the Bretz or Ice Age Floods), which took place between 21,000 and 15,000 years ago and probably destroyed small cinder cones (including those made from tuff) and maar craters, burying them under up to of silt from slack water. Volcanic vents with either extensive eruptions of lava flows or volcanic plugs that filled their vents survived, including Rocky Butte, Prune Hill, and Beacon Rock. However, the upstream side of Rocky Butte was heavily eroded by the flooding. Mount Hood (background) from Rocky Butte Rocky Butte is a prominent, but isolated hill, with two volcanic vents. It is the core remnant of intrusive rock from a heavily eroded, late Pleistocene volcano that erupted basaltic andesite. Like many other vents in the Boring Lava Field, Rocky Butte consists of basaltic andesite with olivine phenocrysts, and it has a calc-alkalic composition. This basaltic andesite can be observed in exposures that extend from its summit park area to the roads below, as well as in a sill (a sheet of intrusive rock wedged between older layers of sedimentary rock, beds of volcanic lava, or tuff, or along the direction of layering in metamorphic rock) between layers of fluvial gravel from the Troutdale Formation on the Butte's eastern slope, within a flow scarp. Vug cavities were identified from rock in the historic quarry on the eastern side of Rocky Butte by scientists from the United States Geological Survey, including optically positive hornblende (also known as pargasite) with a pale brown color. They exhibit prismatic cleavage and extend for a few millimeters in length. Other minerals identified were dark green, pyroxene crystals with 70 percent hedenbergite and 30 percent diopside; white aggregates of tridymite; brown, granular olivine crystals with 80 percent forsterite and 20 percent fayalite; and tiny black, hexagonal plates of hematite with beveled edges. These minerals constitute a rare combination, and Trimble (1963) was unable to explain why free silica tridymite would be found together with low silica olivine. The hill descends to meet the floodplain of the Columbia River, and at lower elevations, the mountain has cliffs on its northern and eastern sides. At the foot of Rocky Butte, there is a fosse (a ditch), which extends for before it opens toward the Columbia River to the north and divides to the south into two arms that run west and southwest. This depression has a width of less than and an average depth between . There is another terrace, with a height of , which sits next to Rocky Butte. It runs for to the west, with a descent of over that distance. To the south, this terrace also has a long depression near its base, which extends for from Rocky Butte. These features are likely the product of more than just erosional forces; Bretz (1925) argued that the fosse resulted from fluid eddies that pushed downward where currents interacted with the eastern side of Rocky Butte, and the terrace formed from accumulation of deposits in water under the blockage. = Eruptive history = Evarts et al. (2009) assign Rocky Butte an age younger than 500,000 years. One Argon‚Äìargon dating experiment determined an age for Rocky Butte lava of 285,000 years ¬± 16,000 years ago, which matches the normal magnetic polarity for the lava deposits at the Butte. There is a magnetic anomaly about northwest from Rocky Butte in Portland, but it is unlikely to be associated with the volcano or the Boring Lava Field in general. Local newspaper sources report that Rocky Butte is extinct. Trimble (1963) noted that an eruption at Rocky Butte covered a hill composed of Troutdale Formation rocks, which are exposed as conglomerate rock at a height of on Rocky Butte's western slope. The exposure of rock from the Troutdale Formation suggests that Rocky Butte erupted onto a topographically irregular surface and that this surface later underwent erosion.  Ecology  The moderate climate and ample precipitation of the region lead to rapid regrowth of vegetation on untended sites, which can hamper fieldwork in the area. Many forests that covered the area were partly cleared for agriculture, timber, or burials in the early 20th century. These cleared and burned land plots sustain rich stands of secondary forest, featuring gorse, huckleberry, nettles, poison oak, salal, and blackberry. Myriad species of fern, as well as rapid-growth deciduous trees like alder and vine maple are also frequent. Forests support stands of Douglas fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, Pacific dogwood, bigleaf maple, Oregon ash, red alder, cascara buckthorn, Pacific madrone, and Oregon white oak; within swamps and moist areas in creeks, the shrub Devil's club can be observed. Other trees that sometimes dominate forest areas include black cottonwood. Forest communities have many additional shrubs including Indian plum, western hazel, and snowberry. Ground layer plants include the herbaceous sword fern and stinging nettle. In contemporary times, clearing of forests for housing development has left about half of the Boring Lava region still forested. As a result, water quality has decreased due to higher sedimentation and turbidity, and flooding has gotten worse over time. Streams within the area are of either first or second order, with moderate to low flows and average gradients between 10 and 12 percent. Cool and clear, many sustain macroinvertebrates, and a smaller number support amphibians and fish. The Riparian zones in the Lava Field area host diverse species, and they are influenced by uplands that serve as migration connections for birds, mammals, reptiles, and some amphibians. Gravel bars extend to the west from Rocky Butte, creating barriers for a lowland marsh. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service provided a list of potentially threatened or endangered species in the Boring Lava area, calling them \\"sensitive\\" species. Among plant species, they determined the following species to be sensitive: white top aster, golden Indian paintbrush, tall bugbane, pale larkspur, peacock larkspur, Willamette daisy, water howellia, Bradshaw's lomatium, Kincaid's lupine, Howell's montia, Nelson's checkermallow, and Oregon sullivantia. For animal and marine life, northwestern pond turtles, Willow flycatchers, long- eared myotises, fringed myotises, long-legged myotises, Yuma myotises, Pacific western big-eared bats, and northern red-legged frogs have been identified as species of concern; pileated woodpeckers, bald eagles, cutthroat trout, and coho salmon are also considered sensitive.  Human history  The Rocky Butte Tunnel During the 1930s, employees of the Works Progress Administration constructed a park at the summit, at an elevation of about . Called Joseph Wood Hill Park, it was built on Rocky Butte when Rocky Butte was known as Wiberg Butte. Rock from Rocky Butte's eastern slopes was used for the Multnomah County jail building, and some were later used for renovation of the Historic Columbia River Highway. There is a communications tower on the southern end of the volcano. The Rocky Butte jail, completed in 1947, served as the major facility for male prisoners in Multnomah County, with a courtyard and recreation field. According to Rubin (1973), the Rocky Butte jail housed 320 inmates, but Houston, Gibbons, and Jones (1988) claimed that it often exceeded this limit. The jail also had a library, which was established in 1967 and housed 3,000 volumes. In general, the jail was known for being the subject of multiple grand jury investigations for security concerns, dirty conditions, access to drugs, violence, lack of organized programming, and most notably, during the 1960s and 1970s for severe overcrowding. Further attempts to replace the Rocky Butte jail were motivated by a successful escape in 1981 and a gun smuggling incident that resulted in an officer being shot in 1982. The Multnomah County Detention Center (MCDC) was built in downtown Portland after Rocky Butte Jail was demolished during the 1980s The Rocky Butte Jail and MCDC participated in a research study on prisons, which was published in 1988 in the journal Crime & Delinquency. In 1934, the Rocky Butte Scenic Drive Historic District was established. Built as part of a Works Progress Administration project that supported 25,000 employees in Portland, it was designed by the Multnomah County Road Department, The drive reaches the summit of Rocky Butte to a viewpoint overlooking Portland. Workers used basalt from the Rocky Butte quarry to create retaining walls, and the finished project was designed to have a rustic style typical for public works projects of the time. WPA workers also built the park and a baroque staircase at the top of Rocky Butte, finishing construction in 1939. At its peak popularity in the 1940s, Rocky Butte had more than 4,000 cars visiting each day. Over time, it was not maintained well, and it became a frequent site for teenage parties; in the early 1990s, the Rocky Butte Preservation Society began cleaning up and restoring the park area, and adding new amenities. Once of land were added and the Preservation Society took on an active maintenance role, the site was regraded, original plaques were reinstalled, and lawn areas, irrigation, red cinder walkways, and additional trees were added to the park. The District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Other WPA projects included a tunnel in length at the southern end of Rocky Butte. Built between 1939 and 1941, it was constructed to improve access to scenic views on the Butte. The project took 16 months to complete, and workers used hand mining and drill and shoot methods to excavate layers of cinders and lava flows. The tunnel is curved because of the volcano's 5 degree grade. Rocky Butte basalt was used to built the Rocky Butte Tunnel as well as the nearby West Burnside Tunnel and NW Cornell Road Tunnel, all three of which were constructed by the mason R. Curcio and his crew. In total, the WPA's Rocky Butte project cost $500,000 to complete. The Hill Military Academy, a prominent military school in Portland, moved from the northwestern district of Portland to a campus on Rocky Butte in 1931. The campus covered on the northern side of the volcano. Ran by its founder, Joseph Wood Hill, it closed in 1959 after its enrollment had declined significantly, and the school was purchased by Judson Baptist College. Today, Portland Bible College has a campus on Rocky Butte with offices and dormitory buildings, and The Grotto, a famous Catholic shrine encompassing , lies adjacent to the volcano. Created in 1924, The Grotto has more than 200,000 visitors annually. It consists of two levels, which are separated by the cliff of Rocky Butte's northern face. On the upper level of the shrine is the Chapel of St. Anne, which sits on the northern side of Rocky Butte and offers views of the Columbia River and Mount St. Helens. Built in 1934, the Chapel also has a Peace Garden (finished in 1989) and a Meditation Chapel, which was completed in 1991. The City Bible Church also maintains a location at Rocky Butte, with services on Sunday mornings at 9:30 and 11:15 am as well as youth services on Wednesdays at 7 pm. At the summit of Rocky Butte, there is a rotating beacon, which although still lit, was decommissioned in the late 1960s. In 2000, Portland Police Bureau Officer Mark Kruger placed a shrine to Nazi soldiers on public park property at Rocky Butte. When Kruger's past was discovered during 2003 lawsuits, Kruger removed the shrine. The shrine was stored in the city attorney's office by then-deputy Tracy Reeve, preventing their discovery during the lawsuits. Kruger remained on the force and was promoted to captain in 2009. Kruger admitted to wearing Nazi uniforms. The shrine's existence was discovered by internal affairs in 2010 after commissioner Dan Saltzman ordered an investigation. Kruger was disciplined and suspended for two weeks in 2010, but was not demoted or fired. Kruger continued to state that he was a history buff, not a Nazi. He remained on the force until his retirement. In May 2018, government officials from the Oregon Department of Transportation began clearing belongings and debris from a long- standing homeless campsite at the eastern side of Rocky Butte, also posting eviction notices. A fire occurred near a homeless camp on the northern side of Rocky Butte in July 2018.  Recreation  The steps leading up to Joseph Wood Hill Park on Rocky Butte Rocky Butte is part of the Rocky Butte Natural Area, encompassing of land on NE Rocky Butte Road. The summit of Rocky Butte is a Portland city park, Joseph Wood Hill Park, which covers . The park offers views of the Boring Lava Field, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood. It lies in the throat of Rocky Butte's former volcanic vent on a bluff above the Hill Military Academy campus; this land was donated by Joseph Hill's sons. The park has red, crushed stone pathways, a stone wall, and a stone pedestal adorned with a metal plague bearing Joseph Wood Hill's image looking to the west. Rocky Butte is a popular location for seeing mountains. In 2017, the Portland Parks & Recreation bureau proposed to clear trees and invasive species in the park to allow better views of downtown Portland, Mount Hood, and Mount St. Helens, planting 400 low-growth trees and 5,200 shrubs in their place. A man was killed after falling from the summit viewpoint in May 2015. Rocky Butte does not have a well-defined trail system. There are a number of climber and biker trails made by civilians on the base and lower parts of the mountain, as well as climbing paths near the summit, which are unfenced and can be unsafe. A walking path described by L. O. Foster (2013) starts from NE 92nd Avenue and Skidmore Street and runs for each way, lasting 1.5 to 2 hours. This trail passes the Rocky Butte Tunnel, the site for the Hill Military Academy, and the beacon. Dogs can be unleashed on the trails, but have to be kept on a leash at Joseph Wood Hill Park. Rocky Butte is also a popular climbing destination in the Portland area, having been developed by climbers during the 1970s and 1980s. Many of its routes are top-roped, but some top anchors are missing from its routes, so daisy chain straps are recommended. The climbing routes are not suitable for dogs or children. Some of the most popular climbs are on the section known as Video Bluff. Rocky Butte provides a variety of climbs including cracks, dihedrals, slab, vertical, and overhanging face routes.

He was a court poet to Earl Sveinn H√°konarson. During the Battle of Nesjar he was captured by King √ìl√°fr Haraldsson's forces. Three of the four stanzas of his that have survived were ostensibly composed while in captivity. One lausav√≠sa is attributed to Bersi in the surviving fragments of √ìl√°fs saga helga by Styrmir K√°rason. But the same stanza is attributed to Sigvatr √û√≥r√∞arson in Heimskringla and to √ìttarr svarti in other sagas on St. √ìl√°fr.Poole 1991, p. 95. Styrmir's saga gives some information on Bersi's career in St. √ìl√°fr's service and indicates that he died in 1030. Bersi was at some point at the court of King Canute the Great where Sigvatr √û√≥r√∞arson addressed him in verse after they had both received gifts from the king.Monsen 2004, p. 357. Apart from being mentioned in the kings' sagas Bersi also has a minor role in Grettis saga, chapters 15, 23 and 24, where he asks Earl Sveinn to spare Grettir √Åsmundarson's life.Fox 2001, page 54.

Concerns regarding foreign ownership generally pertain to ownership of previously 'Canadian' assets by individuals or companies based in countries outside of Canada. The exact definition of \\"foreign-owned\\" is the subject of debate. This article uses the working definition for foreign ownership. Historically, foreign ownership was a political issue in Canada in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when it was believed by some that U.S. investment had reached new heights (though its levels had actually remained stable for decades), and then in the 1980s, during debates over the Free Trade Agreement. But the situation has changed, since in the interim period Canada itself became a major investor and owner of foreign corporations. Since the 1980s, Canada's levels of investment and ownership in foreign companies have been larger than foreign investment and ownership in Canada. In some smaller countries, such as Montenegro, Canadian investment is sizable enough to make up a major portion of the economy. In Northern Ireland, for example, Canada is the largest foreign investor. By becoming foreign owners themselves, Canadians have become far less politically concerned about investment within Canada. Of note is that Canada's largest companies by value, and largest employers, tend to be foreign-owned in a way that is more typical of a developing nation than a G8 member. The best example is the automotive sector, one of Canada's most important industries. It is dominated by American, German, and Japanese giants. Although this situation is not unique to Canada in the global context, it is unique among G-8 nations, and many other relatively small nations also have national automotive companies.

Ways & means The foreign company often needs to incorporate a special-purpose subsidiary in Canada, in order to control its investment. The New Brunswick Business Corporations Act, the Nova Scotia Companies Act, the Quebec Business Corporations Act and the British Columbia Business Corporations Act make no stipulations that resident Canadians be directors.\\"Doing business in Canada: A Practical Guide\\" New Brunswick provides that Extra Provincial Corporations need only have an \\"attorney for service\\" resident in that province.Business Corporations Act of New Brunswick Unlimited liability corporations can exist in Alberta, British Columbia or Nova Scotia. This form is particularly convenient where the parties are well-established and in no danger of insolvency. Alberta requires the derisory fee of CAD$100 to establish this form. In most other provinces, the legislation is significantly more restrictive.

Photo by Mikhail Evstafiev Janet Ann Schneider (born October 24, 1951, in McFarland, Wisconsin) is an American actress and photojournalist. Schneider studied at the University of Wisconsin. Interested in drama, music, and photography, in 1974 she moved to New York City, hoping to break into the theater. She soon found herself performing in productions such as Shenandoah, The Robber Bridegroom, and Othello. Later Broadway she was nominated for a 1986 Tony Award as Best Featured Actress in a Musical for the role Helena Landless in The Mystery of Edwin Drood and won a 1986 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical for her role in The Mystery of Edwin Drood. In 1986, she married musician and composer Tom Wilson, but their marriage did not last very long. In the late 1980s, she decided to become a photojournalist. Schneider worked for several photo agencies including Sipa Press. Her work was published in Time, Newsweek, Stern and other newspapers and magazines. She covered news stories in Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka, Angola, the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan. She was in Baghdad during the Gulf War, and photographed the fall of the Berlin wall, and the break-up of the Soviet Union. In 1992, she covered the Siege of Sarajevo. Retired Maj. Gen. Lewis MacKenzie, the Canadian commander of the United Nations forces in the former Yugoslav city said of Schneider, \\"She was like a breath of fresh air, vivacious in the midst of all those stinky male journalists. I was impressed by her dedication. I told her she would end up either famous or dead.\\" Schneider was badly wounded when a tank shell fired from Serb positions exploded next to her. Her friend Ivo ≈†tandeker, a journalist from Slovenia, was killed. Schneider spent many weeks in the hospital, first with the UN and later in Belgrade, where doctors saved her leg from amputation. Schneider returned to Wisconsin from Bosnia deeply depressed, haunted by Standeker's death and her own close call. She began to focus more on the victims of war. Among them was her friend Darja Lebar, a Slovenian journalist in Sarajevo who had been shot in the face a few months after Standeker died. Schneider helped Lebar raise money for her operations and find doctors to reconstruct her face, and gave her a place to stay at her parents' home in Wisconsin. Schneider also started working on a screenplay about her life and began seeing a psychologist to talk about trauma. After Lebar returned to Sarajevo, Schneider vowed to get back into journalism but this did not happen.

Without Tony's approval, he, Patsy, and Artie attempt to break up the demonstration. As they are being warned by police, Little Paulie has a glass bottle thrown at him, and several other members of his party are injured. Tony blames Silvio for intervening. Ralphie threatens the protest leader, Professor Del Redclay, with publicizing the fact that Iron Eyes Cody, a popular Native American figure, is actually an Italian-American. Tony appeals to Assemblyman Ron Zellman and an Indian chief to convince Redclay to cancel the protest. Although this fails, the chief invites Tony and his crew to his casino. Both the parade and protest occur without mob intervention, which upsets Silvio. Tony forcefully argues to Silvio that his achievements - his profitable club, for example - came through his own abilities, not through being an Italian- American. He scorns the idea that everyone belongs to a victimised group. At a luncheon meant to instill Italian pride in women, the \\"mob wives\\" feel singled out when the speaker attempts to dissociate Italian culture from the Mafia. After the luncheon, Gabriella lectures Father Phil about how much the mob wives, especially Carmela, have given to the parish, and says he had no right to bring in a guest speaker who intended to shame them. The Soprano and Lupertazzi families meet over a meal. Johnny, speaking for Carmine, who is present, demands a share of the profit Tony made from Junior's warehouse, which he bought and quickly turned around. Tony agrees, but later murmurs, \\"Somebody's talking too much. And it's costing me money.\\" Johnny is furiously hostile to Ralphie; Ralphie cannot understand why. Bobby's wife Karen is killed in a road accident. The mob wives feel sympathy for Bobby during the wake and quietly discuss his having never taken a comare. Spending time with him in his home, Janice is touched by his sincere grief. Ralphie is now living with Janice, having left Rosalie. But after discussion with her therapist, who recommends that she stop choosing partners who are similar to her brother or father, Janice wills herself to break up with him. They argue; she is at the top of the staircase and hits Ralphie, causing him to fall downstairs, injuring his back. Janice locks herself in her room as Ralphie hobbles back to his car, bags in hand.

The other band members are Jean-Yves Lozac'h, Olivier Marguerit, Remi Alexandre and Clement Carle. The name Syd Matters comes from the slight modification of the names of two Pink Floyd members: Syd Barrett and Roger Waters.  2001-2005: Jonathan Morali  Syd matters is also the pseudonym of the band's frontman, Jonathan Morali. Morali was born in Paris on 22 May 1980. He started his performing career playing at small bars until winning a contest by French magazine Les Inrockuptibles, and therefore signing a recording contract with Third Side Records. His first published work is \\"Fever In Winter, Shiver In June\\", an EP released in 2002. In 2003, \\"A Whisper and A Sigh\\" was released consisting of 11 tracks, marking his first album-length work. After this album was released, Morali constructed a new quintet band under the same name, Syd Matters, marking the band's official creation in April 2005. Early May 2005, Morali then released his second album, the first of which was recorded with his new band, titled \\"Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles\\". A mixture of folk and melancholic pop, his music combines slow melodies with acoustic instruments while holding true to its roots in electronic music. Morali was also part of the French rock band Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family.  2005-present day  A compilation CD named Syd Matters, was released in America on 16 June 2006. A single disc that contains various songs from his two previous albums, it was released under the label, V2 North America. In January 2008, he released the album \\"Ghost Days\\". On 16 March 2011, Syd Matters released their latest album, \\"Brotherocean\\". Among his other works are a duet with Ane Brun, \\"Little Lights\\" which was released in 2005.  Media appearances  His songs \\"To All of You\\" (\\"American Girls\\") and \\"Hello Sunshine\\", a Super Furry Animals cover, were featured in the television series The O.C. in season 3's The Party Favor and season 4's The Metamorphosis, respectively. Additionally, \\"Obstacles\\" and \\"To All of You\\" were featured in Dontnod Entertainment's 2015 video game Life Is Strange. Morali also composed the original score for the game. The soundtrack to Life is Strange won numerous awards including: best soundtrack at the 2015 PlayStation Universe awards, best soundtrack at the Game Informer Best of 2015 awards and best soundtrack at the Titanium Awards. Following this, Morali also collaborated with director R√©mi Chay√© to create the score for the animated film Long Way North (2015), where he included two tracks by Syd Matters in the soundtrack.  Reputation  Since Syd Matters‚Äô debut, their experimental genre has been continuously reviewed by critics. Their second album, \\"Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles\\", brought the band mainstream attention with a review in the 32nd issue of Music Week.Syd Matters: Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles. (2005). Music Week. The unique sound they produce has been said to draw inspiration from genres such as prog rock, dub music, and Traditional pop, while also resembling that of singer-songwriter artists but at its core is often considered a mix between folk and electronic genres. In their reviews, they have also been compared to other artists such as Fleet Foxes, Fionn Regan, Grandaddy, The Flaming Lips, and Nick Drake.

It was not until the late eighteenth century that scholars become aware of it, when the bibliographer Angelo Maria Bandini published a description of it in Latin in 1793.Dibble, \\"Sahag√∫n's Historia\\", p. 16. The work became more generally known in the nineteenth century, with a description published by P. Fr. Marcelino de Civezza in 1879.Dibble, \\"Sahag√∫n's Historia,\\" p. 16. The Spanish Royal Academy of History learned of this work and, at the fifth meeting of the International Congress of Americanists, the find was announced to the larger scholarly community.Dibble, \\"Sahag√∫n's Historia\\", p. 16.

In 1979, the Mexican government published a full-color, three-volume facsimile of the Florentine Codex in a limited edition of 2,000, allowing scholars to have easier access to the manuscript. The Archivo General de la Naci√≥n (Dra. Alejandra Moreno Toscano, director) supervised the project that was published by the Secretariat of the Interior (Prof. Enrique Olivares Santana, Secretary). The 2012 World Digital Library high-resolution digital version of the manuscript makes it fully accessible online to all those interested in this source for Mexican and Aztec history. Sahag√∫n's motivations for research Goldsmith measuring a gold article The missionary Sahag√∫n had the goal of evangelizing the indigenous Mesoamerican peoples, and his writings were devoted to this end. He described this work as an explanation of the \\"divine, or rather idolatrous, human, and natural things of New Spain.\\"H. B. Nicholson, \\"Fray Bernardino De Sahag√∫n: A Spanish Missionary in New Spain, 1529-1590,\\" in Representing Aztec Ritual: Performance, Text, and Image in the Work of Sahag√∫n, ed. Eloise Qui√±ones Keber (Boulder: University of Colorado Press, 2002). Prologue to Book XI, Introductory Volume, page 46. He compared its body of knowledge to that needed by a physician to cure the \\"patient\\" suffering from idolatry. He had three overarching goals for his research: #To describe and explain ancient Indigenous religion, beliefs, practices, deities. This was to help friars and others understand this \\"idolatrous\\" religion in order to evangelize the Aztecs. #To create a vocabulary of the Aztec language, Nahuatl. This provides more than definitions from a dictionary, as it gives an explanation of their cultural origins, with pictures. This was to help friars and others learn Nahuatl and to understand the cultural context of the language. #To record and document the great cultural inheritance of the Indigenous peoples of New Spain.Alfredo L√≥pez Austin, \\"The Research Method of Fray Bernardino De Sahag√∫n: The Questionnaires,\\" in Sixteenth-Century Mexico: The Work of Sahag√∫n, ed. Munro S. Edmonson (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1974). Page 121. Sahag√∫n conducted research for several decades, edited and revised his work over several decades, created several versions of a 2,400-page manuscript, and addressed a cluster of religious, cultural and nature themes.Edmonson, M. S. (Ed.) (1974) Sixteenth-century Mexico: The Work of Sahag√∫n, Albuquerque, New Mexico, University of New Mexico Press. Copies of the work were sent by ship to the royal court of Spain and to the Vatican in the late-sixteenth century to explain Aztec culture. The copies of the work were essentially lost for about two centuries, until a scholar rediscovered it in the Laurentian Library (Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana) an archive library in Florence, Italy. The Spanish also had earlier drafts in their archives. A scholarly community of historians, anthropologists, art historians, and linguists has since been investigating Sahag√∫n's work, its subtleties and mysteries, for more than 200 years.For a history of this scholarly work, see Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla, Bernardino De Sahag√∫n: The First Anthropologist (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2002). Evolution, format, and structure An illustration of the \\"One Flower\\" ceremony, from the 16th-century Florentine Codex. The two drums are the teponaztli (foreground) and the huehuetl (background). The Florentine Codex is a complex document, assembled, edited, and appended over decades. Essentially it is three integral texts: (1) in Nahuatl; (2) a Spanish text; (3) pictorials. The final version of the Florentine Codex was completed in 1569.Howard F. Cline, \\"Evolution of the Historia General\\" in Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, Part 2, Austin: University of Texas Press, 1973, pp. 189-207. Sahag√∫n's goals of orienting fellow missionaries to Aztec culture, providing a rich Nahuatl vocabulary, and recording the indigenous cultural heritage are at times in competition within the work. The manuscript pages are generally arranged in two columns, with Nahuatl, written first, on the right and a Spanish gloss or translation on the left. Diverse voices, views, and opinions are expressed in these 2,400 pages, and the result is a document that is sometimes contradictory. Scholars have proposed several classical and medieval worldbook authors who inspired Sahag√∫n, such as Aristotle, Pliny, Isidore of Seville, and Bartholomew the Englishman. These shaped the late medieval approach to the organization of knowledge.L√≥pez Austin, \\"The Research Method of Fray Bernardino De Sahag√∫n: The Questionnaires.\\" The twelve books of the Florentine Codex are organized in the following way: #Gods, religious beliefs and rituals, cosmology, and moral philosophy, #Humanity (society, politics, economics, including anatomy and disease), #Natural history. Book 12, the account of the conquest of Mexico from the point of view of the conquered of Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco is the only strictly historical book of the Historia General. This work follows the organizational logic found in medieval encyclopedias, in particular the 19-volume De proprietatibus rerum of Sahag√∫n's fellow Franciscan Friar Bartholomew the Englishman. One scholar has argued that Bartholomew's work served as a conceptual model for Sahag√∫n, although evidence is circumstantial.D. Robertson, \\"The Sixteenth Century Mexican Encyclopedia of Fray Bernardino de Sahag√∫n,\\" Journal of World History 4 (1966). Both men present descriptions of the cosmos, society and nature of the late medieval paradigm. Additionally, in one of the prologues, Sahag√∫n assumes full responsibility for dividing the Nahuatl text into books and chapters, quite late into the evolution of the Codex (approximately 1566-1568).James Lockhart, ed. and trans., We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993). ‚ÄúVery likely,‚Äù historian James Lockhart notes, ‚ÄúSahag√∫n himself devised the chapter titles, in Spanish, and the Nahuatl chapter titles may well be a translation of them, reversing the usual process.‚ÄùJames Lockhart, ed. and trans., We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), p. 30. Images within the Florentine Codex After the facsimile edition became available generally in 1979, the illustrations of the Florentine Codex could be analyzed in detail. Previously, the images were known mainly through the black-and-white drawings found in various earlier publications, which were separated from the alphabetic text.Eloise Qui√±ones Keber, \\"Reading Images: The Making and Meaning of the Sahaguntine Illustrations,\\" in The Work of Bernardino de Sahag√∫n: Pioneer Ethnographer of Sixteenth-Century Aztec Mexico. J. Jorge Klor de Alva et al. eds. Albany: Institute for Mesoamerican Studies. SUNY Albany 1988, p.202. The images in the Florentine Codex were created as an integral element of the larger opus. Although many of the images show evidence of European influence, a careful analysis by one scholar posits that they were created by \\"members of the hereditary profession of tlacuilo or native scribe-painter.\\"Jeanette Favrot Peterson. \\"The Florentine Codex Imagery and the Colonial Tlacuilo,\\" in The Work of Bernardino de Sahag√∫n: Pioneer Ethnographer of Sixteenth-Century Aztec Mexico, J. Jorge Klor de Alva et al. eds. Albany: Institute for Mesoamerican Studies. SUNY Albany 1988, p.273. The images were inserted in places in the text left open for them, and in some cases the blank space has not been filled. This strongly suggests that when the manuscripts were sent to Spain, they were as yet unfinished.Peterson, \\"The Florentine Codex Imagery,\\" p. 277. The images are of two types, what can be called \\"primary figures\\" that amplify the meaning of the alphabetic texts, and \\"ornamentals\\" that were decorative.Peterson, \\"The Florentine Codex Imagery,\\" p. 273. The majority of the nearly 2,500 images are \\"primary figures\\" (approximately 2000), with the remainder ornamental.Peterson, \\"The Florentine Codex Imagery,\\" p. 274. The figures were drawn in black outline first, with color added later.Peterson, \\"The Florentine Codex Imagery,\\" p. 274. Scholars have concluded that several artists, of varying skill, created the images.Donald Robertson, Mexican Manuscript Painting of the Early Colonial Period. New Haven: Yale University Press 1959, p. 178. Art historian Diana Magaloni Kerpel deduced that twenty- two artists worked on the images in the Codex. She did this by analyzing the different ways that forms of body were drawn, such as the eyes, profile, and proportions of the body. Additionally, Magaloni studied the different artists' treatments of lines. It is not clear what artistic sources the scribes drew from, but the library of the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco had European books with illustrations and books of engravings.Peterson, \\"The Florentine Codex Imagery\\", p. 278. European elements appear in the imagery, as well as pre-Conquest images done in the \\"native style\\".Peterson, \\"The Florentine Codex Images,\\" p. 279.Robertson, Mexican Manuscript Painting, pp. 15-23. A number of the images have Christian elements, which Peterson has described as \\"Christian editorializing.\\"Peterson, \\"The Florentine Codex Imagery,\\" p. 293. The entirety of the Codex is characterized by the Nahua belief that the use of color activates the image and causes it to embody the true nature, or ixiptla, of the object or person depicted. For the Aztecs, the true self or identity of a person or object was shown via the external layer, or skin. Imparting color onto an image would change it so that it was given the identity of what it was portraying. Color was also used as a vehicle to impart knowledge that worked in tandem with the image itself. Books Merchants selecting gemstones, from Book 9 of the Codex. The codex is composed of the following twelve books:Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain (Translation of and Introduction to Historia General De Las Cosas De La Nueva Espa√±a; 12 Volumes in 13 Books). #The Gods.

Ethnographic methodologies Aztec warriors as shown in the Florentine Codex. Xipe Totec, \\"Our Lord the Flayed One,\\" an Aztec (Mexica) deity Sahag√∫n was among the first people to develop an array of strategies for gathering and validating knowledge of indigenous New World cultures. Much later, the discipline of anthropology would later formalize these as ethnography. This is the scientific research strategy to document the beliefs, behavior, social roles and relationships, and worldview of another culture, and to explain these within the logic of that culture. Ethnography requires scholars to practice empathy with persons very different from them, and to try to suspend their own cultural beliefs in order to enter into, understand, and explain the worldview of those living in another culture. Sahag√∫n systematically gathered knowledge from a range of diverse persons (now known as informants in anthropology), who were recognized as having expert knowledge of Aztec culture. He did so in the native language of Nahuatl, while comparing the answers from different sources of information. According to James Lockhart, Sahag√∫n collected statements from indigenous people of \\"relatively advanced age and high status, having what was said written down in Nahuatl by the aids he had trained.\\"James Lockhart, ed. and trans., We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), p. 27 Some passages appear to be the transcription of spontaneous narration of religious beliefs, society or nature. Other parts clearly reflect a consistent set of questions presented to different people designed to elicit specific information. Some sections of text report Sahag√∫n's own narration of events or commentary. He developed a methodology with the following elements: #He used the native language of Nahuatl. #He elicited information of elders, cultural authorities publicly recognized as most knowledgeable. #He adapted the project to the ways in which Aztec culture recorded and transmitted knowledge. #He used the expertise of his former students at the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, whom he credited by name. #He attempted to capture the totality or complete reality of Aztec culture on its own terms. #He structured his inquiry by using questionnaires, but also could adapt to using more valuable information shared with him by other means. #He attended to the diverse ways that diverse meanings are transmitted through Nahuatl linguistics. #He undertook a comparative evaluation of information, drawing from multiple sources, in order to determine the degree of confidence with which he could regard that information. #He collected information on the conquest of Mexico from the point of view of the Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco, who had been defeated. These methodological innovations substantiate historians' claim that Sahag√∫n was the first anthropologist. Most of the Florentine Codex is alphabetic text in Nahuatl and Spanish, but its 2,000 pictures provide vivid images of sixteenth- century New Spain. Some of these images directly support the alphabetic text; others are thematically related; others are for seemingly decorative purposes. Some are colorful and large, taking up most of a page; others are black and white sketches. The pictorial images offer remarkable detail about life in New Spain, but they do not bear titles, and the relationship of some to the adjoining text is not always self-evident. They can be considered a \\"third column of language\\" in the manuscript. Several different artists' hands have been identified, and many questions about their accuracy have been raised. The drawings convey a blend of Indigenous and European artistic elements and cultural influences.For analysis of the pictures and the artists, see several contributions to John Frederick Schwaller, ed., Sahag√∫n at 500: Essays on the Quincentenary of the Birth of Fr. Bernardino de Sahag√∫n (Berkeley: Academy of American Franciscan History, 2003). Many passages of the texts in the Florentine Codex present descriptions of like items (e.g., gods, classes of people, animals) according to consistent patterns. Because of this, scholars have concluded that Sahag√∫n used a series of questionnaires to structure his interviews and collect data. For instance, the following questions appear to have been used to gather information about the gods for Book One: #What are the titles, the attributes, or the characteristics of the god? #What were his powers? #What ceremonies were performed in his honor? #What was his attire? For Book Ten, \\"The People,\\" a questionnaire may have been used to gather information about the social organization of labor and workers, with questions such as: #What is the (trader, artisan) called and why? #What particular gods did they venerate? #How were their gods attired? #How were they worshiped? #What do they produce? #How did each occupation work? This book also described some other indigenous groups in Mesoamerica. Sahag√∫n was particularly interested in Nahua medicine. The information he collected is a major contribution to the history of medicine generally. His interest was likely related to the high death rate at the time from plagues and diseases. Many thousands of people died, including friars and students at the school. Sections of Books Ten and Eleven describe human anatomy, disease, and medicinal plant remedies.Alfredo L√≥pez Austin, \\"Sahag√∫n's Work and the Medicine of the Ancient Nahuas: Possibilities for Study,\\" in Sixteenth-Century Mexico: The Work of Sahag√∫n, ed. Munro S. Edmonson (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1974). The passage on human anatomy appears primarily intended to record vocabulary. The ethnobotanic section is an insertion into Book Eleven, and reads quite differently from the rest of this book. Sahag√∫n named more than a dozen Aztec doctors who dictated and edited these sections. A questionnaire such as the following may have been used in this section: #What is the name of the plant (plant part)? #What does it look like? #What does it cure? #How is the medicine prepared? #How is it administered? #Where is it found? The text in this section provides very detailed information about location, cultivation, and medical uses of plants and plant parts, as well as information about the uses of animal products as medicine. The drawings in this section provide important visual information to amplify the alphabetic text. The information is useful for a wider understanding of the history of botany and the history of zoology. Scholars have speculated that Sahag√∫n was involved in the creation of the Badianus Manuscript, an herbal created in 1552 that has pictorials of medicinal plants and their uses. Although this was originally written in Nahuatl, only the Latin translation has survived. One of the first images of maize to be sent to Europe Book Eleven, \\"Earthly Things,\\" has the most text and approximately half of the drawings in the codex. The text describes it as a \\"forest, garden, orchard of the Mexican language.\\"Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain (Translation of and Introduction to Historia General de Las Cosas de la Nueva Espa√±a; 12 Volumes in 13 Books), Prologue to Book XI, Introductory Volume, page 88. It describes the Aztec cultural understanding of the animals, birds, insects, fish and trees in Mesoamerica. Sahag√∫n appeared to have asked questions about animals such as the following: #What is the name of the animal? #What animals does it resemble? #Where does it live? #Why does it receive this name? #What does it look like? #What habits does it have? #What does it feed on? #How does it hunt? #What sounds does it make? Plants and animals are described in association with their behavior and natural conditions or habitat. The Nahua presented their information in a way consistent with their worldview. For modern readers, this combination of ways of presenting materials is sometimes contradictory and confusing. Other sections include data on minerals, mining, bridges, roads, types of terrain, and food crops. The Florentine Codex is one of the most remarkable social science research projects ever conducted. It is not unique as a chronicle of encountering the New World and its peoples, for there were others in this era. Sahag√∫n's methods for gathering information from the perspective within a foreign culture were highly unusual for this time. He reported the worldview of people of Central Mexico as they understood it, rather than describing the society exclusively from the European perspective. \\"The scope of the Historia's coverage of contact-period Central Mexico indigenous culture is remarkable, unmatched by any other sixteenth-century works that attempted to describe the native way of life.\\"Nicholson, \\"Fray Bernardino De Sahag√∫n: A Spanish Missionary in New Spain, 1529-1590.\\" page 27.

Career =Playing career= Darlington began his career as a trainee at Charlton Athletic, where he played two first-team games near the end of the 1991‚Äì92 season. He was released a year later and dropped out of the professional game, continuing his career on a semi-professional basis, playing with Dover Athletic, Hendon and Aylesbury United. He got a second chance in the Football League in 1999, when he was signed by Queens Park Rangers from non-League club Aylesbury United, for ¬£25,000. Darlington went on to make over 80 professional appearances for the R's before then First Division side Wimbledon bought him for ¬£200,000 in 2001. He made over 100 appearances for The Dons, before being released at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season. Brief stints at Watford and Cardiff City followed in 2004‚Äì05, and 2005‚Äì06 however with a knee injury restricting his first-team chances Darlington left Cardiff in the summer of 2006, effectively retiring from professional football. Following a trial with AFC Wimbledon, Darlington agreed terms with the Dons in time for the game against Tonbridge Angels on 18 November 2006, making him the first ex-Wimbledon player to play competitively for AFC Wimbledon.While Darlington was the first ex-Wimbledon FC player to play competitively for AFC Wimbledon he was actually the second ex-Wimbledon player to join the club. The first was Roger Joseph who was at the club briefly at the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season but left after playing a just handful of pre-season friendly fixtures. This move would prove costly for the Dons however as, due to an administrative error by the club in signing him, Darlington was initially ineligible to play for the club.When Darlington signed for AFC Wimbledon his previous club was Cardiff City. Cardiff play in the English League structure, which is administered by The FA of England. However, as with other Welsh clubs competing in the English leagues, the players of Cardiff City are actually registerred to the FA of Wales. As a result of this, when Darlington signed for AFC Wimbledon, his registration was not held by the FA but by the FAW and as such he was regarded as an 'international' signing and the club was therefore required to seek 'international clearance' for his registration to be transferred from one FA to the other. AFC Wimbledon were not aware of this and as a result Darlington was considered to be ineligible for competitive fixtures. The penalties the club received for this mistake were severe. The Dons were expelled from two cup competitions, the Surrey Senior Cup and the FA Trophy, for which the club was ordered to repay ¬£12,000 in prize money, and also received a hefty penalty in the Isthmian League with 18 league points being docked, in addition to a ¬£400 fine & costs. This 18-point penalty was later reduced to just three points, after an appeal to The FA. Darlington was released at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season by new Dons boss Terry Brown. After his release from AFC Wimbledon Darlington did not find another semi pro club, instead opting to play local football in London. However, in October 2009 and at the age of 35 he made the move back to the semi pro game, signing for Isthmian League Premier Division side Maidstone United. Darlington subsequently joined Isthmian League Division One South side Whitstable Town in March 2011, providing much needed cover and experience. Manager Peter Nott was quoted on the capture of Darlington: \\"As you can see Jermaine brings a wealth of experience with him and I am confident he will settle in very quickly\\". He made his Natives debut on 15 March 2011 in a home loss to Whyteleafe. He retired from playing after leaving Whitstable. =Coaching and management= After retiring from football, Darlington became joint manager of Sittingbourne U21s alongside John Embery in 2015.

It is part of the Boring Lava Field, which includes more than 80 small volcanic edifices and lava flows in the Portland‚ÄìVancouver metropolitan area. The region around Powell Butte has a cool climate, and the butte and its surroundings feature meadows, rivers, and mixed forests. Powell Butte hosts the Powell Butte Nature Park, which includes about of trails for biking, hiking, and horseback riding. Powell Butte lies within historic territory of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. The land surrounding the butte has been used for an orchard, farming, and scientific research on potatoes. Today two underground reservoirs at the Butte each hold of fresh water as a primary part of the public water system for Portland and much of the surrounding region.  Geography and geology  Powell Butte is located in Multnomah County in the U.S. state of Oregon. According to the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, the butte reaches an elevation of , while the Geographic Names Information System lists the mountain's elevation at . J.E. Allen, an Emeritus Professor of Geology at Portland State University, listed its elevation as in a 1975 publication. Powell Butte is a cinder cone butte and is part of the Plio-Pleistocene Boring Lava Field, a group of volcanic cones that got their name from the low, forested Boring Hills formation. Located in the Portland Basin, the Boring Lava Field consists of monogenetic volcanic cones that appear as hills throughout the area, reaching heights of above their surroundings. The field includes more than 80 small volcanic edifices and lava flows in the Portland‚ÄìVancouver metropolitan area, with the possibility of more volcanic deposits buried under sedimentary rock layers. Volcanism in the Boring Lava Field is the product of subduction of the Juan de Fuca oceanic tectonic plate under the North American continental tectonic plate, as well as regional rifting. Powell Butte lies northwest of the Boring Hills, and the surrounding area includes (moving clockwise from the north) other volcanic centers like Green Mountain, Prune Hill, Chamberlain Hill, Devils Rest, Larch Mountain, Pepper Mountain, Kelly Butte, and Mount Tabor. The top of Powell Butte consists of volcanic rock from the Troutdale Formation, on top of which are remnants from a local eruption in the Boring Lava Field, including scoria and volcanic ash. Powell Butte is one of the smaller volcanic cones in the Boring Lava Field. During the Pliocene (5 million to 2 million years ago), hyaloclastite formed from interaction of Cascade, alumina-rich basalt lava with the Columbia River. After these hyaloclastite units were deposited, further deformation occurred, leading to the accumulation of gravel and lithic fragments to elevations of in the Portland area. Powell Butte is partially mantled by post hyaloclastite gravel from the Troutdale Formation, which is likely the result of redeposited soil after erosion. Like the rest of the Boring Lava Field, Powell Butte is extinct.  Climate and ecology  The climate at Powell Butte is cool, creating a short growing season environment. It supports grass meadows, which sustain apple, pear, and walnut trees. Powell Butte sits near Johnson Creek, a tributary of the Willamette River that sustains native salmon and rainbow trout. It also supports the Powell Butte Nature Park and its associated meadow and forest areas. These habitats are populated by bats, black-tailed mule deer, chipmunks, coyotes, gray foxes, ground squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, ring-necked pheasants, and skunks. Birds of prey are common among the park's open meadows, groves of wild hawthorn and western red cedar trees, and wetlands. Kestrels and red-tailed hawks hunt on top of the butte. There are mixed forests of bigleaf maple and Douglas fir trees on the butte's northern side.  Human history  Powell Butte lies within historic territory of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, which covered more than and extended from the Columbia River to the Klamath River. At the end of the 19th century, much of the meadow area near Powell Butte was cleared and replaced with an orchard by settlers. In 1925, the Portland city government bought the land encompassing Powell Butte from George Wilson with the intent to use it for water reservoirs. They leased the northeastern part of the land to farmer Henry Anderegg, who owned and operated the Meadowland Crest Dairy until 1948. In the mid-1970s, Portland's Water Bureau created a development plan for Powell Butte including four underground reservoirs to be built at the northern side of the mountain. The first of these reservoirs was constructed in 1981 and the second in 2014. From 1986 to 2018, Powell Butte was the site of one of two facilities of Oregon State University's Central Oregon Agricultural Research Center. The Powell Butte agricultural research farm acted as a center for potato variety development and hay production. The site encompassed , most of which were dedicated to potato seed development. In 2010, an outbreak of the potato cyst nematode Globodera ellingtonae caused the farm to shut down, with major research activity moving to a different site in the city of Klamath Falls. In June 2018, the land was sold to an industrial hemp producer.  Recreation  Powell Butte Nature Park, 2017 Powell Butte hosts the Powell Butte Nature Park, which encompasses an area of about . The nature park was established by Portland city government in 1987 and opened to the public in 1990 and is maintained by Portland Parks & Recreation; it currently includes a natural area, trails for biking, horseback riding, and hiking. The Friends of Powell Butte is an organization formed in 1990, which is focused on protecting the resources of the nature park. It meets monthly to implement park planning and improvement and gather citizen input. Within the Boring Lava Field, Mount Tabor and Powell Butte are better known for their recreational uses than other cones. Powell Butte Nature Park offers of trails, with many formal and informal paths. The top of the butte also offers views of Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and Mount St. Helens.

Exposure equation Until the late 1960s, cameras did not have built-in exposure meters, and many photographers did not have external exposure meters. Consequently, it often was necessary to calculate exposure from lighting conditions. The relationship of recommended photographic exposure to a scene's average luminance is given by the camera exposure equation :\\\\frac {A^2} {T} = \\\\frac {B S_x} {K} \\\\, where * A is the f-number (reciprocal of the relative aperture) * T is the exposure time (\\"shutter speed\\") in seconds * B is the average scene luminance (\\"brightness\\") * S_x is the ASA arithmetic film speed * K is the reflected-light meter calibration constant Use of the symbol B for luminance reflects photographic industry practice at the time of ASA PH2.5-1960; current SI practice prefers the symbol L. German sources typically used k for the relative aperture. Many authors now use N and t for relative aperture and exposure time. Recommendations for the value of the calibration constant K in applicable ANSI and ISO standards have varied slightly over the years; this topic is discussed in greater detail under Exposure meter calibration in the Light meter article. Exposure value In an attempt to simplify choosing among combinations of equivalent camera settings, the concept of exposure values (German: Lichtwert) was originally developed and proposed to other manufacturers by the German shutter manufacturer in the early 1950s. Combinations of shutter speed and relative aperture that resulted in the same exposure were said to have the same exposure value E_v, a base-2 logarithmic scale defined by :E_v = \\\\log_2 {\\\\frac {A^2} {T} } = \\\\log_2 {\\\\frac {B S_x} {K} } \\\\,. When applied to the left- hand side of the exposure equation, E_v denoted combinations of camera settings; when applied to the right-hand side, E_v denoted combinations of luminance and film speed. For a given film speed, the recommended exposure value was determined solely by the luminance. Once the exposure value was determined, it could be directly set on cameras with an E_v scale. Adjustment of exposure was simple, because a change of 1 E_v corresponded to a change of 1 exposure step, i.e., either a halving or doubling of exposure. Starting 1954, the so-called Exposure Value Scale (EVS), originally known as Light Value Scale (LVS), was adopted by Rollei, Hasselblad, Voigtl√§nder, Braun, Kodak, Seikosha, Aires, Konica, Olympus, Ricoh and others, introducing lenses with coupled shutters and apertures, such that, after setting the exposure value, adjusting either the shutter speed or aperture made a corresponding adjustment in the other to maintain a constant exposure. On some models, the coupling of shutter speed and aperture setting was optional, so that photographers could choose their preferred method of working depending on the situation. Use of the E_v scale on such cameras is discussed briefly by Adams (1981, 39). Modern cameras no longer display exposure values as such, but continue to offer exposure modes, which support users in employing the concept of counter-adjusting shutter speed and aperture at a fixed point of exposure. This can be found in features such as Manual Shift on some Minolta, Konica Minolta and Sony Alpha or Hyper Manual on some Pentax (D)SLRs since 1991, where the photographer can change one of the parameters, and the camera will adjust the other accordingly for as long as the Auto-Exposure Lock (AEL) function is activated. In a wider sense, functions like , Pa / Ps Creative Program Control (by Minolta, Konica Minolta and Sony) or Hyper Program (by Pentax) belong to this group of features as well. The additive (logarithmic) system Although some photographers (Adams 1981, 66)Ansel Adams described the exposure equation in a slightly different form: Using these values for A and T gives :\\\\frac {A^2} {T} = \\\\frac { \\\\left ( \\\\sqrt S \\\\right ) ^2 } {1/L} = LS \\\\,. Ostensibly, the calibration constant K is missing, but with luminance in cd/ft2, the value was unity (ASA Z38.2.6-1948 specified a range of 1‚Äì1.35; ASA PH2.12-1961 specified 1.06 ¬± 0.16. The current recommendation in ISO 2720:1974 would be 0.98‚Äì1.24 with luminance in cd/ft2). routinely determined camera settings using the exposure equation, it generally was assumed that doing so would prove too daunting for the casual photographer. The 1942 ASA exposure guide, ASA Z38.2.2-1942, featured a dial calculator, and revisions in 1949 and 1955 used a similar approach. An alternative simplification also was possible: ASA PH2.5-1960 proposed extending the concept of exposure value to all exposure parameters. Taking base-2 logarithms of both sides of the exposure equation and separating numerators and denominators reduces exposure calculation to a matter of addition: :E_v = A_v + T_v = B_v + S_v \\\\,, where * A_v is the aperture value: A_v = \\\\log_2 A^2 * T_v is the time value: T_v = \\\\log_2 (1/T) * E_v is the exposure value: E_v = A_v + T_v. * S_v is the speed value (aka sensitivity value): S_v = \\\\log_2 (N S_x) * B_v is the luminance value (aka brightness value): B_v = \\\\log_2 (B / N K) * N is a constant that establishes the relationship between the ASA arithmetic film speed S_x and the ASA speed value S_v. The value of N is approximately 0.30 (precisely, 2^{-7/4}). The origin of the value of 2^{-7/4} for N is arcane, apparently so much so that ASA PH2.12-1961 included an explanation of what ASA PH2.5-1960 had intended. * K is the reflected-light meter calibration constant ASA standards covered incident-light meters as well as reflected-light meters; the incident-light exposure equation is : \\\\frac {A^2} {T} = \\\\frac {I S_x} {C} \\\\,, where * I is the scene illuminance * C is the incident-light meter calibration constant The use of I for illuminance reflects photographic industry practice at the time of the 1961 ASA standard for exposure meters, ASA PH2.12-1961; current SI practice prefers the symbol E. ASA PH2.12-1961 included incident- light metering in the APEX concept: :E_v = A_v + T_v = I_v + S_v \\\\,, where * I_v is the incident-light value: I_v = \\\\log_2 (I / N C) (German sources typically use LW (for Lichtwert or Belichtungswert ‚Äî but not to be confused with the English term light value) instead of the exposure value's symbol E_v. Consequently, the aperture value A_v is referred to as Blendenleitwert LWk, and the time value T_v as Zeitleitwert LWt. The film speed value S_v is named Empfindlichkeitsleitwert, and the brightness value B_v is known as Objekthelligkeit.) APEX in practice APEX made exposure computation a relatively simple matter; the foreword of ASA PH2.5-1960 recommended that exposure meters, exposure calculators, and exposure tables be modified to incorporate the logarithmic values that APEX required. In many instances, this was done: the 1973 and 1986 ANSI exposure guides, ANSI PH2.7-1973 and ANSI PH2.7-1986, eliminated exposure calculator dials in favor of tabulated APEX values. However, the logarithmic markings for aperture and shutter speed required to set the computed exposure were never incorporated in consumer cameras. Accordingly, no reference to APEX was made in ANSI PH3.49-1971 (though it was included in the Appendix). The incorporation of exposure meters in many cameras in the late 1960s eliminated the need to compute exposure, so APEX saw little actual use. With the passage of time, formatting of APEX quantities has varied considerably; although the v originally was subscript, it sometimes was given simply as lower case, and sometimes as uppercase. Treating these quantities as acronyms rather than quantity symbols probably is reasonable because several of the quantity symbols (E, B, and I for exposure, luminance, and illuminance) used at the time APEX was proposed are in conflict with current preferred SI practice. A few artifacts of APEX remain. Canon, Pentax and Leica cameras use 'Av' and 'Tv' to indicate relative aperture and shutter speed as well as to symbolize aperture priority and shutter priority modes. Some Pentax DSLRs even provide a 'TAv' exposure mode to automatically set the ISO speed depending on the desired aperture and shutter settings, and 'Sv' (for sensitivity priority) to pre-set the ISO speed and let the camera choose the other parameters. Some meters, such as Pentax spot meters, directly indicate the exposure value for ISO 100 film speed. For a given film speed, exposure value is directly related to luminance, although the relationship depends on the reflected-light meter calibration constant K. Most photographic equipment manufacturers specify metering sensitivities in EV at ISO 100 speed (the uppercase 'V' is almost universal). It is common to express exposure increments in EV, as when adjusting exposure relative to what a light meter indicates (Ray 2000, 316). For example, an exposure compensation of +1 EV (or +1 step) means to increase exposure, by using either a longer exposure time or a smaller f-number. The sense of exposure compensation is opposite that of the EV scale itself. An increase in exposure corresponds to a decrease in EV, so an exposure compensation of +1 EV results in a smaller EV; conversely, an exposure compensation of ‚àí1 EV results in a greater EV. Use of APEX values in Exif APEX has seen a partial resurrection in the Exif standard, which calls for storing exposure data using APEX values. There are some minor differences from the original APEX in both terminology and values. The implied value (1/3.125) for the speed scaling constant N given in the Exif 2.2 specification (\\"Exif 2.2\\"; JEITA 2002) differs slightly from the APEX value of 2^{-7/4} (0.2973); with the Exif value, an ISO arithmetic film speed of 100 corresponds exactly to a speed valueExif 2.2 refers to S_\\\\mathrm {v} as \\"film sensitivity.\\" S_\\\\mathrm {v} of 5. The relationship between B_{\\\\mathrm {v}} and luminance depends on both the speed scaling constant N and the reflected- light meter calibration constant K: :B_\\\\mathrm {v} = \\\\log_2 \\\\frac {B} {NK} \\\\,. Because Exif 2.2 records ISO arithmetic speed rather than film sensitivity, the value of N affects the recorded value of B_{\\\\mathrm {v}} but not the recorded film speed. Exif 2.2 does not recommend a range of values for K, presumably leaving the choice to the equipment manufacturer. The example data in Annex C of Exif 2.2 give 1 footlambert for B_{\\\\mathrm {v}} = 0. This is in agreement with the APEX value for B, but would imply K = 1/N, or 3.125 with B in footlamberts. With B in cd/m2, this becomes 10.7, which is slightly less than the value of 12.5 recommended by ISO 2720:1974 and currently used by many manufacturers. The difference possibly arises from rounding B in the example table; it also is possible that the example data simply were copied from an old ASA or ANSI standard.

He was born in Charlottenburg Township in Upper Canada in 1820 and grew up in Glengarry County. He went to California with two of his brothers as a prospector in 1850 but had returned by 1860. When gold was discovered in the Cariboo region of British Columbia, he took his family west and arrived in Victoria, British Columbia in 1862. Cameron and his partner Robert Stevenson discovered one of the richest claims in the Cariboo on Williams Creek. His wife Margaret Sophia had died of typhoid fever just prior to this and Cameron had promised to take her back to Canada West for burial. Cameron and his partner hauled the body 400 miles by toboggan to Victoria, where the body was buried temporarily in a coffin filled with alcohol. The town of Camerontown or Cameronton, long since abandoned, sprung up near Cameron's claim because he wanted to finish mining his claim as quickly as possible and employed 75 men working three shifts. In 1863, he left the Cariboo and transported the coffin back by ship, crossing overland at the Isthmus of Panama, and eventually returned home where he had the coffin reburied. In 1865, he remarried and built a new residence at Fairfield at Summerstown, on property formerly owned by John Cameron, a distant relative.

The making of Rupert and the Frog Song began in 1981 and ended in 1983. The film was released theatrically as an accompaniment to McCartney's film Give My Regards to Broad Street. The song \\"We All Stand Together\\" from the film's soundtrack reached No. 3 when released in the UK Singles Chart. It was released in 2004 as one of the segments of Paul McCartney: Music & Animation. Plot Rupert Bear decides to head off for a walk on the hills. With his Mother's blessing, he sets off for a jolly trip, encountering his friends Edward Elephant and Bill Badger along the way, who are too busy to join him - Bill needs to look after his baby brother and Edward has to do some shopping. As Rupert reaches a hill, he props himself up against the trunk of an oak tree and enjoys the glory of the countryside. Suddenly, he finds himself enveloped by a rainbow cloud of butterflies previously masquerading as leaves on the oak tree, and all of them swarm away from the leafless tree towards a rocky outcrop; Rupert cannot resist following them. As he leaves, a large white barn owl and two black cats decide to follow him. Upon the rocks, Rupert finds a large number of multicolored frogs. He walks into a cave behind a waterfall and sees three signs: \\"Frogs only beyond this point\\", \\"Everything except frogs must be kept on a lead\\", and \\"Guard frogs operating\\". He sneaks into the palace, trying to avoid getting caught by the frog guards. There, he witnesses the Frog Song, an event that occurs only once in a few hundred years in which various frogs of all shapes and sizes come together and sing \\"We All Stand Together\\". Around the end, the frog King and Queen rise out of the water before the crowd to finish off the song. After a thunderous applause from the frogs, the owl, who had followed Rupert to find out where the frogs were hiding, launches itself for an attack on the royals, but Rupert manages to warn the frogs in time and they all quickly retreat, leaving the owl and the cats empty-handed and the palace completely empty. After hearing his mother call him, Rupert excitedly rushes home to tell his family about what he saw.

The video was released simultaneously with the single \\"We All Stand Together\\" and became the biggest-selling video of 1985, as well as being nominated for the 'Best Music Video ‚Äì Short Form' at the Grammy Awards in 1986. The video also included two other shorts with music by Linda McCartney: \\"Seaside Woman\\" (a song credited to Suzy and the Red Stripes) and, \\"The Oriental Nightfish\\". In September 2004, the film was re-released on DVD Tales of Wonder Music and Animation Classics (also called Paul McCartney ‚Äì Music & Animation Collection), to mark its 20th Anniversary, along with two other shorts directed by Geoff Dunbar, Tropic Island Hum and Tuesday. This version contains an alternative opening, which begins in an old bedroom filled with Rupert merchandise. We see Paul McCartney opening a large chest and digging through old dusty books until he comes upon an old Rupert book. He takes it out of the chest, blows on it, and dust flies away from the book (sparkling dust in the 2004 DVD). McCartney opens the book to reveal his childhood house address, a possible reference to the VHS covers of this film. The page then turns to the title card. The print of this version is also matted, cropping the top and bottom of the image to an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen, which was how the film was exhibited theatrically. The opening for this edition was previously used at the start of a music video for the song \\"We All Stand Together\\". The film is displayed as a looping video at the Museum of Canterbury in England. In October 2020, McCartney announced a restoration of the film, alongside a re-release of the picture disc single, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Rupert character. Awards and nominations In 1984, the year of its release, it won a UK BAFTA (British Academy Award) for Best Animated Short Film.

It is linked by Highway 1 with Kandahar to the southwest and Ghazni and Kabul to the northeast. The population of the town are ethnic Pashtuns, mostly from the Ghilji tribe, after whom the city is named. The total population of Qalati Ghilji is 49,158 (2015). The city has 4 police districts (nahias) with a total land area of 4,820 Hectares and 5,462 total number of dwellings. Qalati Ghilji is a Provincial Centre located in southern Afghanistan. Barren land is the dominant land use classification 59% of total land. While built-up land use only accounts for 19% of total land use, within that classification there is a large proportion of institutional land (33%). Qalati Ghilji also has two distinct industrial areas in Districts 2 and 3. In 2006, Zabul's first airport was built near Qalat.USAID/Afghanistan: First Airstrip in Zabul Province Qalat became home to the U.S.-led Provincial Reconstruction Team Zabul, which began assisting in development projects and building governance throughout the province. Other names Qalati Ghilji has been known as QalƒÅt-i Khaljƒ´, QalƒÅt-i Tokhƒ´, or simply QalƒÅt or KalƒÅt.  History  In medieval times, the area was within the heartland of the Khalaj tribe. The Khalji dynasty of India had origin from this city. Some of the Khalaj were Pashtunized, transforming into the Ghilji tribe of Pashtuns.The Khalaj West of the Oxus, by V. Minorsky: Khyber.ORG. ; excerpts from \\"The Turkish Dialect of the Khalaj\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, Vol 10, No 2, pp 417-437 (retrieved 10 January 2007). A political mission came through the city April 16, 1857 en route to Kandahar to broker a new treaty of friendship between the British government at Peshawar and the Amir of Kabul. The party was greeted by a group sent out by the heir-apparent to welcome them and check on the party's supplies. Two companies of infantry were formed so the British could inspect the troops. Afterwards, a shura was held. The fortress in Qalat City. The sketch was done by a captain in the British expedition. The Qalat Fortress in Qalat, Zabul Province, Afghanistan circa spring 2013.

In the battle, he lost a son, Mahomed Ali, killed in single combat by his uncle. His uncle was subsequently killed. Climate Qalati Ghilji features a semi-arid climate (BSk) under the K√∂ppen climate classification. The average temperature in Qalat is 13.6 ¬∞C, while the annual precipitation averages 283 mm. July is the hottest month of the year with an average temperature of 27.5 ¬∞C. The coldest month January has an average temperature of -2.9 ¬∞C.  American reconstruction efforts  In an effort to bring economic development to the area, Zabul province's first air strip was built just outside the city in 2006. It is a dirt runway. The first flight brought in supplies for PRT Zabul and other organizations trying to rebuild the area. Three years later, a girls school was built to attempt to improve education in the area. An initial school supply and prayer mat donation was made, and regular book drops and school supply donations were made until the PRT left in 2013. Clean water programs around the city improved the availability of clean water sources. In 2009, efforts were completed to improve the water system at the old Qalat City Hospital to bring clean drinking water to patients there. Not all the reconstruction efforts were successful, however. In 2006, construction began on a new economic district for the city. Meant to be an area of commerce and development, ten million dollars and three years later, most of the buildings are unoccupied, unusable either due to lack of the skills to maintain the buildings or due to a lack of need for the building. Zabul province's governor refused to move into the new house, citing the lack of security.

Its Latin title is Declaratio de associationibus massonicis. The document states that Catholics who join Masonic organizations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion. It was issued in 1983 by the prefect of the congregation, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI on April 19, 2005. History of canon law regarding Freemasonry Catholic canon law has forbidden membership in Masonic organizations since 1738, with Pope Clement XII's papal bull In eminenti apostolatus. Later popes continued to ban Masonic membership through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. When canon law was codified into the 1917 Code of Canon Law, these existing prohibitions were preserved in the code, especially in Can 2335. The 1917 code forbids Catholics, under the penalty of excommunication, to enroll in Masonic or other similar associations. > Can 2335: Affiliation With Masonic or Similar Societies. Those who join a > Masonic sect or other societies of the same sort, which plot against the > Church or against legitimate civil authority, incur ipso facto an > excommunication simply reserved to the Holy See. [p. 924.] The 1983 Code of Canon Law superseded the 1917 Code. Specific mention of Masonry was omitted from the new code. Membership in organizations that \\"plot against the Church\\", however, is prohibited. > Can. 1374. A person who joins an association which plots against the Church > is to be punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in > such an association is to be punished with an interdict. In the 1917 code, Masonry was specifically mentioned, but in the 1983 code it was not. Since the new canon law did not specifically mention Masonry, any issues or questions about Roman Catholics with Masonic associations were clarified by this document, which states that \\"the Church‚Äôs negative judgment in regard to Masonic association[s] remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enroll in Masonic associations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion.\\" Legal status The relevance of the declaration under canon law is unclear. Canon law allows for a process by which provisions of the code are interpreted authoritatively.Canon 16 of the 1983 code. It has been argued, however,Eugen Lennhoff/Oskar Posner/Dieter Binder: Internationales Freimaurer- Lexikon. Munich 2011. Entry on \\"Katholizismus, Katholische Kirche\\". that the declaration cannot be regarded as an authoritative interpretation of canon 2335, prohibiting membership in organizations which plot against the Church, since it does not make reference to it. In addition, the declaration was not issued by the authority which issued the legal provision it interprets, which also casts doubt on the view that canon 2335 is interpreted authoritatively. It thus remains unclear, even under the declaration, whether membership in Masonry is, by itself, forbidden to Catholics under canon law.

Its first power base was in Hitachi Province. The clan was subdued by Minamoto no Yoritomo in the late 12th century, but later entered Yoritomo's service as vassals. In the Muromachi period, the Satake served as provincial deputy (shugo) of Hitachi Province (today Ibaraki Prefecture), under the aegis of the Ashikaga shogunate. The clan sided with the Western Army during the Battle of Sekigahara, and was punished by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who moved it to a smaller territory in northern Dewa Province (northern Honsh≈´) at the start of the Edo period. The Satake survived as lords (daimy≈ç) of the Kubota Domain (also known as the Akita Domain). Over the course of the Edo period, two major branches of the Satake clan were established, one ruled the fief of Iwasaki, the other one the fief of Kubota- Shinden. During the Boshin War of 1868‚Äì69, the Satake were signatories to the pact that formed the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei, but after internal debate and a disagreement with the Sendai Domain, the clan switched sides and joined the imperial forces in subduing the alliance. As with all other daimy≈ç families, the Satake clan was relieved of its title in 1871. Origins The Satake clan claimed descent from Satake Masayoshi, the grandson of the prominent 11th century warrior Minamoto no Yoshimitsu. \\"Satake-shi\\" on Harimaya.com (accessed 15 August 2008) Yoshimitsu received land in Mutsu Province and Hitachi Province as a reward for his military service, and took up residence at Satake village, in Hitachi. Yoshimitsu willed the territory around Satake village to his son, Yoshinobu. Yoshinobu, in turn, passed it on to his own son, Masayoshi. The Satake clan would remain in Hitachi until they were ordered to move in 1602.Saga, Memories of Silk and Straw, pp. 16-17. In 1106, Masayoshi led a rebellion against Minamoto no Yoshikuni, a power figure in neighboring Shimotsuke Province, but was defeated and killed by Yoshikuni, who followed him back to Hitachi.\\"Ashikaga-shi (Kamakura kub≈ç)\\" on Harimaya.com (accessed 19 August 2008). During the Genpei War, Masayoshi's son Takayoshi sided with Taira no Kiyomori. The Satake clan was defeated by Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1180, and its territory confiscated; it was not until nine years later that Yoritomo forgave Takayoshi's son Hideyoshi, and allowed Hideyoshi to become his vassal. Hideyoshi served in the attack on Mutsu Province. The Satake clan later returned to its old territory in Hitachi. Muromachi and Sengoku periods Image of an armored Satake Yoshinobu, prominent Sengoku-era Satake clan head In the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573), the Satake family's heads served as hereditary governors (shugo) of Hitachi Province. They were vassals of the Ashikaga shogunate's Kamakura-kub≈ç, the Kamakura-based official who oversaw the Ashikaga shogunate's affairs in the Kant≈ç region. The Satake clan saw a great deal of military service under the Ashikaga banner. In the Sengoku period, the Satake worked toward unifying the often rebellious clans of the Hitachi region under their control. Satake Yoshishige, family head during the early Sengoku period, was renowned for his ferocity in battle; he was also known by the nickname of . He often fought against the Later H≈çj≈ç clan, who were extending their power into southern Hitachi. One such encounter was the Battle of Numajiri, where 20,000 men under Yoshishige fought 80,000 H≈çj≈ç troops. The Satake won, due in part to the use of over 8600 matchlock rifles by their troops. In 1586 and again in 1589, the Satake also fought with the Date clanKarino, p. 6. at Sukagawa, but were ultimately defeated by forces under the command of Date Masamune. In 1590, under the headship of Yoshishige's son Satake Yoshinobu, the Satake clan pledged fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Siege of Odawara.Karino, Satake-shi rekidai ryakuji, p. 7. After the fall of Odawara, Hideyoshi accepted them as vassals, and guaranteed their lordship of a 540,000 koku swath of territory in Hitachi Province. Having received recognition from Hideyoshi as the ruler of Hitachi Province, Yoshinobu's drive for unifying the province under his rule was strengthened. He brought nearly all of the province under his control, with the exception of the Tsuchiura and Shimodate areas, the control of which Hideyoshi had assured to the Y≈´ki clan. In 1593, the Satake clan joined in Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea, deploying troops to Nagoya Castle in Hizen Province. Edo era In 1600, the Satake sided with the Western Army at the Battle of Sekigahara, and were discovered to be in secret communication with Ishida Mitsunari, the leader of the Western Army.Naramoto, Nihon no kassen: monoshiri jiten, p. 376. After the Western Army's defeat by the Eastern forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the Satake clan was allowed to remain where they were in Hitachi but they would be punished by the victorious Tokugawa. The clan's income was severely reduced and in 1602 the clan was ordered to relocate to Kubota, a much smaller fief in northern Japan, where they remained until 1871. \\"Kubota-han\\" on Edo 300 HTML (accessed 15 August 2008)Karino, p. 8. Kubota's income level was 205,000 koku, and it was classified as an outside (tozama) daimy≈ç. The income level remained constant throughout its history. The domain often had agricultural crises, which resulted in several peasant uprisings throughout the course of its history. It was also beset by an internal o-ie s≈çd≈ç conflict, the , which was brought on by financial issues. Satake Yoshimasa, 9th generation lord of Kubota Satake Yoshiatsu (better known by his nom-de-plume Satake Shozan), the 8th generation lord of Kubota, was an accomplished artist.French, Through Closed Doors: Western Influence on Japanese Art 1639‚Äì1853, p. 124. Yoshiatsu painted a number of paintings in the Dutch style, and also produced three treatises on European painting techniques, including the depiction of perspective.\\"Akita ranga\\" on Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System. Accessed 19 August 2008. He was also a student of Dutch studies (rangaku) scholar Hiraga Gennai, who he had invited up to Akita to advise him on management of the domain's copper mines. It was during Yoshiatsu's lifetime that the of art was born and briefly flourished. The Kubota domain was uncommon in that it contained more than one castle, despite the Tokugawa shogunate's \\"one castle per domain\\" rule. The main castle was Kubota Castle, but there were also castles at Yokote and ≈ådate, and five fortified estates elsewhere in the domain: Kakudate, Yuzawa, Hiyama, J≈´niso, and In'nai.Karino, p. 9. Each of these was given to a senior retainer who ran it as his own small castle town. The senior retainers had personal retainers who resided in these castle towns. Two of the clan elder (kar≈ç) families serving the Kubota domain were branches of the Satake family. One was the North Satake family (Satake-hokke), stipended at 10,000 koku; the other the West Satake family (Satake-nishike), stipended at 7200 koku. The North Satake family had its landholdings around Kakunodate, one of the fortified estates mentioned above; the West Satake resided in and had their landholdings around ≈ådate. Another kar≈ç family unrelated to the Satake was the Tomura, who held Yokote castle.Zusetsu: Nihon meij≈ç-sh≈´, p. 14. During its rule over Kubota, the Satake clan was ranked as a ' family, and as such, had the privilege of shogunal audiences in the Great Hall (Ohiroma) of Edo Castle. Though no Satake lord ever held the office of sh≈çgun, the clan (together with many of the other domains of northern Honsh≈´) assisted the shogunate in policing the frontier region of Ezochi (now Hokkaido).Noguchi, Aizu-han, p. 194. Boshin war Shiroishi Castle, the headquarters of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei After the restoration of imperial rule in late 1867, the Boshin War broke out in early 1868, pitting the coalition of southern domains against the forces of the former Tokugawa shogunate. After the city of Edo fell, remnants of the Tokugawa forces retreated northward, and the fighting followed northward. The Satake clan was a signatory to the pact that formed the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei,Onodera, Boshin nanboku sens≈ç to T≈çhoku seiken, p. 140. the alliance of anti-Satch≈ç northern domains led by the Sendai Domain. The Satake clan's delegation at Shiroishi, the alliance's headquarters, was led by the clan elder (kar≈ç) Tomura Yoshiari.Also known as Tomura J≈´day≈´.Yamakawa, Aizu Boshin senshi, p. 319. However, the Satake had political difficulties with the alliance, which culminated in the murder,Yamakawa, p. 348. in Akita, of a delegation from Sendai on August 21, 1868,July 4th by the lunisolar calendar.Onodera, Boshin nanboku sens≈ç to T≈çhoku seiken, p. 193.Hoshi, ≈åuetsu Reppand≈çmei, p. 125-126. and the display of the messengers' gibbeted heads in the Akita castle town.Onodera, p. 156. The Sendai delegation, led by Shimo Matazaemon, was dispatched to request the Akita domain to hand over Kuj≈ç Michitaka and other officials of the imperial delegation that had been originally sent to the region to gather support for the imperial cause.Hoshi, p. 125. The Satake then backed out of the alliance and supported the imperial army; eleven days later, on September 1, 1868July 15th by the lunisolar calendar. the Tsugaru clan of the neighboring Hirosaki domain followed suit.McClellan, Woman in the Crested Kimono, p. 104. In response, the pro- alliance domains of Morioka and Ichinoseki sent troops to attack Kubota.Onodera, p. 194. Kubota forces were hard-pressed to defend their territory, with the result that the alliance troops had made serious advances before the war's end; Yokote Castle was burned, and by October 7, Morioka troops took ≈ådate, one of the Akita domain's castles.August 22 by the lunisolar calendar. See Onodera, p. 194. In early 1869, Satake Yoshitaka formally gave up the domain's registers to the imperial government, and was made imperial governor of the Akita domain (han chiji).Karino, p. 40. In mid-1869, the imperial government rewarded the service rendered by the main line of the Satake clan, by raising its income by 20,000 koku.Karino, p. 40. The heads of all the Satake clan's branches were relieved of office as daimy≈ç in 1871,Karino, p. 41. and ordered to relocate to Tokyo. Meiji and beyond In the Meiji era, Satake Yoshitaka was ennobled with the title of marquess (k≈çshaku).Karino, p. 41.List of Meiji-era Japanese nobility (accessed 17 August 2008) Satake Yoshisato of Iwasaki received the title of viscount (shishaku). The North Satake family received the title of baron (danshaku). Yoshitaka's son Yoshinao served in the Imperial Japanese Army, and fought in the Satsuma Rebellion.Karino, p. 41.

The crossing of the Andes was a major step in the strategy devised by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n to defeat the royalist forces at their stronghold of Lima, Viceroyalty of Per√∫, and secure the Spanish American independence movements. Setting out from Mendoza -then part of the Province of Cuyo- in January 1817, their goal was to enter royalist-held Chile without being noticed, through unexpected paths, so as to attack the royalist forces by surprise. The ultimate objective was the liberation of Chile from Spanish rule with Argentine forces. Led by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, the crossing took 21 days. Background The idea of crossing the Andes was already developed by secret lodges seeking the independence of South America, and was part of the Maitland Plan designed by Thomas Maitland. San Mart√≠n learned of it during his brief time in Britain, before sailing to South America. After becoming aware of the difficulty of attacking the royalist stronghold of Lima across Upper Peru, he decided to proceed with such a plan. The Captaincy General of Chile had removed their governor in 1810, and replaced him with the First Government Junta, starting a period of Chilean history known as Patria Vieja. However, they would be defeated in 1814 during the battle of Rancagua, and with the Reconquista Chile would become again a royalist stronghold. Bernardo O'Higgins and other Chilean leaders had fled to Mendoza during the new royalist government, which led to O'Higgins being part of the Army of the Andes as well as the Argentine soldiers. Troops and equipment The city of Mendoza, during this time frame, became a factoring headquarters during the pre- crossing. The citizens of Mendoza assisted their troops by manufacturing gunpowder and ammunition. They also learned to make cannons. The main food of the army was a regional meal called valdiviano. It was prepared with dry meat or charqui, sliced raw onion, and boiling water. They had designated soldiers who carried the food. These soldiers transported forty tons of charqui; maize cakes; meat; brandy, to counter the nighttime cold; garlic and onion, to deal with the lack of appetite; more than 4,000 cattle for the rest of the campaign; plus cheese and rum.\\"Chacabuco 1817.\\" Glasgow and District Wargaming Society. Crossing On the morning of January 19, 1817, San Martin and his army set out from their base camp El Plumerillo and began their journey across the Andes Mountain range. San Martin crossed with 4,000 men, only to end up losing 1/3 of them. It was a devastating blow to the troop. The number of auxiliaries reached 1,200. For the crossing, San Martin split his army into two divisions: The main division, which traveled through the pass of Los Patos, was led by San Martin, Miguel Estanislao Soler and Bernardo O'Higgins. The secondary troop, which traveled through the more southern Uspallata, was led by Juan Gregorio de Las Heras. Coming to an end On February 13, 1817, San Mart√≠n, O‚ÄôHiggins, and their army successfully entered Santiago, Chile, after crossing 500 kilometers of mountain range, and the journey came to an end.Scheina, Robert L. Latin America's Wars. The royalist forces, by this time, had advanced north to avoid San Mart√≠n's army, but a royalist leader had stayed behind with 1,500 men to advance at a valley called Chacabuco, which was located near Santiago.Robertson, William Spence. \\"History of Latin-America Nations.\\"' Thus, the Battle of Chacabuco began.

The play was first performed at the Circle Repertory Company in their theatre at 99 Seventh Avenue South in New York City, later moving to Broadway, opening on April 6, 1987, in The Longacre Theatre. Both productions were directed by the playwright and shared the same cast. The play is said to have been based on several 1940s mystery movies, including The Cat and the Canary, one of Bob Hope's first films. Synopsis The creative team responsible for a recent Broadway flop (in which three chorus girls were murdered by the mysterious \\"Stage Door Slasher\\") assemble for a backer's audition of their new show at the Westchester estate of a wealthy \\"angel.\\" The house is replete with sliding panels, secret passageways and a German maid who is apparently four different people- all of which figure diabolically in the comic mayhem that follows when the infamous \\"slasher\\" makes his reappearance and strikes again. Plot The play takes place in a mansion in Chappaqua, New York in December 1940, specifically, the library. The mansion is owned by Elsa Von Grossenknueten, and her maid, Helsa Wenzel. In the opening scene, we see Helsa is killed by a masked figure. We also see Elsa talking to a police officer, Michael Kelly, about some sort of undercover scheme. Both are unaware of the maid's murder. The next morning, we see Helsa again, only now her entire personality seems to have changed overnight. The guests Elsa has invited soon begin to arrive. They have been invited for a backer's audition to the Musical White House Merry-Go- Round. The first of the invited guests is an Irish tenor named Patrick O'Reilly. He's quickly followed by a bombastic theatre director named Ken De La Maize, and a beautiful young singer/dancer named Nikki Crandall. Nikki is followed in by a young (and bad) comedian named Eddie McCuen, who takes an instant liking to Nikki. While talking with Nikki, Eddie realizes that everyone coming (including Marjorie Baverstock, the producer, and Roger Hopewell and Bernice Roth, the writers) were all part of the creative team that made Manhattan Holiday, in which The Stage Door Slasher murdered three women. Eddie instantly wants to leave, and tells Nikki that she should leave as well, but he decides to stay after Marjorie and Elsa enter and woo him into staying. Roger Hopewell and Bernice Roth arrive and meet the performers, and the group gets started with their work. After things get underway, Marjorie is murdered and the body of Helsa is discovered. After a series of dizzy conversations, multiple trips through secret doorways leading to a labyrinth of hidden passageways, a power outage in the mansion, multiple crimes, and criminals are revealed. Eventually after much murderous mayhem the Stage Door Slasher is revealed and captured through deciphering Bebe's coded notebook. It is revealed to be Ken the weird director.Video of a director talking about the theatre production and its history, The Nomad Theatre. Main characters =Helsa Wenzel= Helsa is the maid of the Grossenknueten estate. She is killed in the first scene of the play, only to be impersonated by her homicidal twin brother, Dieter. The actress who plays Helsa also appears at the end of the play as \\"Katrina, the cook from Koblenz.\\" =Elsa Von Grossenknueten= Elsa is the eccentric owner of the mansion and is the financial backer of many musicals. Elsa summons the group together in an attempt to find out who murdered her \\"friend\\" Bebe McAllister. She is extremely eccentric, and thinks that the idea of chasing after a killer is great fun. Her grandfather was a spy, and she claims that espionage runs in her blood. =Michael Kelly= Kelly is an undercover cop. Elsa appeals to him to help solve the mystery of the Stage Door Slasher, and Kelly at first pretends to be her butler. Kelly's tough, no-nonsense attitude puts him at odds with Elsa and the dramatic types that visit. He eventually reveals his identity as a New York police officer, much to Elsa's dismay. In the second act, he is kidnapped by an unseen figure and disappears into a secret passage, and is later found with his hands tied a gag in his mouth. Willie C. Carpenter was the first to play him. =Patrick O'Reilly= O'Reilly claims to be an Irish tenor, but he is very suspicious, especially with regard to the mysterious Helsa. The two engage in a physical brawl. Eventually, O'Reilly claims to be \\"Tony Garibaldi\\", an undercover cop with a Bronx accent-only to reveal himself as a Gestapo Agent named Klaus Stansdorff, sent to find German defectors. Nikki confronts him, but before he can reveal the truth, Helsa stabs him through a copy of Moby-Dick in the second act, killing him. The original O'Reilly was played by Nicholas Wyman. =Ken De La Maize= First played by Michael Ayr. Ken is a \\"typical\\" director, speaking of theater as a \\"pure art.\\" He also has an annoying habit of name-dropping, constantly citing the various celebrities he has worked with over the years. Everyone always claims to have seen the films he makes, only for him to reveal that they have not yet been released. Ken is eventually revealed as the Stage Door Slasher, and explains that his hatred of ballet dancers stems from his father, who ran off with one and abandoned his mother. He attempts to kill Nikki, along with Elsa, Roger and Bernice. Eddie ends up thwarting him, and he is taken away to prison, rambling about how he knows Louella Parsons. =Nikki Crandall= Originally played by Dorothy Cantwell. Nikki is considered a typical chorus girl-but she is eventually revealed to be Ensign Nicole Crandall, of United States Naval Intelligence. Her secret mission was to find the Germans who were sent over to sabotage the American war efforts. She is also interested in solving the mystery of the Stage Door Slasher, and helps to break the code in Bebe's notebook. Ken almost kills her, followed quickly by Dieter Wenzel. Eddie saves her twice, prompting the two to fall in love at the end. =Eddie McCuen= Directly based on Bob Hope, Eddie is the out of work comedian that ties the different story lines together, and goes from being cowardly at the beginning of the play to heroic at the end. He is attracted to Nikki, but fumbles when he tries to talk to her. He was a replacement for an actor, and thus has no connection to Manhattan Holiday. He is the one who realizes the connection between the Slasher case and the party, and later helps to defeat Ken and Dieter, both by knocking them out with a cognac bottle. These brave actions unite him with Nikki. He has an obvious attraction to Nikki throughout the whole play, and ultimately ends up saving the day and getting the girl. First played by Kelly Connell. =Marjorie Baverstock= Marjorie is a Broadway producer. She constantly flatters everyone around her, and speaks in elevated language; her \\"new word\\" is \\"divoon.\\" She is accidentally killed by Dieter at the end of the first act; strangely, no one seems to notice, despite the fact that there is an enormous sword through her back. Eddie, Ken and Kelly bury her dead body in a snowdrift in the beginning of the second act. Marjorie was first played by Pamela Dunlap. =Roger Hopewell= Originally played by Richard Seff. Roger is the composer for \\"White House Merry-Go- Round\\", and Bernice's partner; the two have had a string of Broadway hits. Roger enjoys teasing Ken about his artistic ways, and makes snide remarks throughout the play, but flares up whenever someone insults his musical style. He also knows how to deal with Bernice's many quirks. Towards the end of the play, Roger reveals a surprising knowledge of ciphers, and helps Nikki and Bernice break the code in Bebe's notebook. =Bernice Roth= The perpetually thirsty lyricist, she is Roger's partner. Bernice is very odd and emotional, frequently losing her composure and screaming. When Marjorie fails to respond to the second act opening number of \\"White House Merry-Go-Round\\", Bernice is hugely offended, despite the fact that Marjorie was dead at the time. She spends the entire second act attempting to \\"fix\\" the play, even when she is held hostage by Ken, O'Reilly, and Dieter. In the finale, she is struck with inspiration toward a new work that takes place in the heartland of America ‚Äì a cowboy play called Nebraska. This is a spoof on the play Oklahoma!. Bobo Lewis originated the role.

Work Dahms's research and teaching pertains to the tensions in the modern age between economic change, on the one hand, and politics, culture and society, on the other. Interpreting the contributions of Marx and Weber, in particular, as foundations for a dynamic theory of modern society, he starts out from the proposition that it is only from the perspective of ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù (including the debates about restructuring, transnational corporations, and neo-imperialism) that the contradictions and paradoxes of modern society can be disentangled. The spectrum of his theoretical reference points reach from the critical theory of the Frankfurt School at one end, to Joseph Schumpeter's social theory of capitalism, at the other. In modern society, a particular kind of social order fused with a specific type of social processes, into an inherently irreconcilable force-field that maintains stability by devising mechanisms designed to contain the destructive power of the contradictions, in the process continually deepening those contradictions. The consequence is a widening gap between the categories social scientists employ to ‚Äúmeaningfully‚Äù interpret present conditions, and the categories that would have to be developed and deployed to maintain the possibility of meaning‚Äîsocially, culturally, and politically.

Background In 1840, Rhode Island still used as its constitution the King's Charter of 1663, which held that only landowners with $134 in property could vote. This effectively disenfranchised 60% of the state's free white men. History In 1841 and 1842, Rhode Island Governor Samuel Ward King faced opposition by Thomas Wilson Dorr and his followers, the Rhode Island Suffrage Party, who wanted to extend suffrage to a wider group of citizens. Governor King put together a Law and Order coalition of Whigs and conservative Democrats to put down the opposition. King and his coalition declared martial law on May 4, 1842. The state militia ended the rebellion by the end of the summer of 1842. Although they were initially opposed to extending suffrage, the Law and Order Party realized that the 1663 charter was archaic. After the rebellion, it became clear that they needed to compromise. In November 1842, they drafted a \\"Law And Order Constitution\\" which extended the right to vote to all native-born adult males, including black men. Effective May 1843, this new Constitution replaced the old King's Charter of 1663.

Early life Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, an art teacher of Finnish descent, English title: \\"Google vice president visits the land of her ancestors\\". and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies. Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years. She has a younger brother. She would later describe herself as having been \\"painfully shy\\" as a child and teenager. She \\"never had fewer than one after-school activity per day,\\" participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies. During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her \\"criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence\\". At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science.  Education  = Wausau West High School = When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team. She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics. She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad. Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up. During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk. After graduating from high school in 1993, Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia. = Stanford University = Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon, Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University. She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems, a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science. At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools. During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer. Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997 and an MS in computer science in 1999. For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel- recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language. = Illinois Institute of Technology = In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search. Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland. She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design. Career =Google (1999 - 2012) = 265x265px After graduating from Stanford, Mayer received 14 job offers, including a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University and a consulting job at McKinsey & Company. She joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20. She started out writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings. She became known for her attention to detail, which helped land her a promotion to product manager, and later she became director of consumer web products. She oversaw the layout of Google's well-known, unadorned search homepage. She was also on the three-person team responsible for Google AdWords, which is an advertising platform that allows businesses to show their product to relevant potential customers based on their search terms. AdWords helped deliver 96% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2011. 267x267px In 2002, Mayer started the Associate Product Manager (APM) program, a Google mentorship initiative to recruit new talents and cultivate them for leadership roles. Each year, Mayer selected a number of junior employees for the two-year program, where they took on extracurricular assignments and intensive evening classes. Notable graduates of the program include Bret Taylor and Justin Rosenstein. In 2005, Mayer became Vice President of Search Products and User Experience. Mayer held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail. Mayer was the vice president of Google Search Products and User Experience until the end of 2010, when she was asked by then-CEO Eric Schmidt to head the Local, Maps, and Location Services. In 2011, she secured Google's acquisition of survey site Zagat for $125 million. While Mayer was working at Google, she taught introductory computer programming at Stanford and mentored students at the East Palo Alto Charter School. She was awarded the Centennial Teaching Award and the Forsythe Award from Stanford. =Yahoo! (2012 - 2017)= TechCrunch Disrupt On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She was also a member of the company's board of directors. At the time of her appointment, Yahoo's numbers had been falling behind those of Google for over a year and the company had been through several top management changes. To simplify the bureaucratic process and \\"make the culture the best version of itself\\", Mayer launched a new online program called PB&J.; It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter. In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major personnel policy change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles. Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite‚ÄîMayer was consequently criticized for the telecommuting ban. In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its time allowance and providing a cash bonus to parents. CNN noted this was in line with other Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook and Google. Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker. On May 20, 2013, Mayer led Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr in a $1.1 billion acquisition. In February 2016, Yahoo! acknowledged that the value of Tumblr had fallen by $230 million since it was acquired. In July 2013, Yahoo! reported a fall in revenues, but a rise in profits compared with the same period in the previous year. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares falling 1.7%. In September 2013, it was reported that the stock price of Yahoo! had doubled over the 14 months since Mayer's appointment. However, much of this growth may be attributed to Yahoo!'s stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, which was acquired before Mayer's tenure. Mayer delivering a conference 268x268px In November 2013, Mayer instituted a performance review system based on a bell curve ranking of employees, suggesting that managers rank their employees on a bell curve, with those at the low end being fired. Employees complained that some managers were viewing the process as mandatory. In February 2016, a former Yahoo! employee filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that Yahoo's firing practices have violated both California and federal labor laws. In 2014, Mayer was ranked sixth on Fortunes 40 under 40 list, and was ranked the 16th most-powerful businesswoman in the world that year according to the same publication. In March 2016 Fortune would name Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders. Yahoo! stocks continued to fall by more than 30% throughout 2015, while 12 key executives left the company. In December 2015, the New York-based hedge fund SpringOwl, a shareholder in Yahoo Inc., released a statement arguing that Mayer be replaced as CEO. Starboard Value, an activist investing firm that owns a stake in Yahoo, likewise wrote a scathing letter regarding Mayer's performance at Yahoo. By January 2016, it was further estimated that Yahoo!'s core business has been worth less than zero dollars for the past few quarters. In February 2016, Mayer confirmed that Yahoo! was considering the possibility of selling its core business. In March 2017, it was reported that Mayer could receive a $23 million termination package upon the sale of Yahoo! to Verizon. Mayer announced her resignation on June 13, 2017. In spite of large losses in advertising revenue at Yahoo! and a 50% reduction in staff during her 5 years as CEO, Mayer was paid a total of $239 million over that time, mainly in stock and stock options. On the day of her resignation, Mayer publicly highlighted many of the company's achievements during her tenure, including: creating $43B in market capitalization, tripling Yahoo stock, growing mobile users to over 650 million, building a $1.5B mobile ad business, and transforming Yahoo's culture. Over Mayer's tenure, the number of monthly visits on Yahoo's home page went down from nearly 10 billion to less than 4.5 while Google's went up from 17 billion to over 56. At the time of Mayer's hiring, Yahoo's numbers had already been falling behind those of Google's for over a year. However, Mayer proved unable to reverse this trend. On 8 November 2017, along with several other present and former corporate CEOs, Mayer testified before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding major security breaches at Yahoo during 2013 and 2014.Shabbad, Rebecca \\"Senate panel holds hearing on Equifax, Yahoo security breaches\\"; CBS News; 8 Nov. 2017.Justice Dept. \\"U.S. Charges Russian FSB Officers and Their Criminal Conspirators for Hacking Yahoo and Millions of Email Accounts\\"; U.S. Department of Justice; 15 March 2017. Allegations of gender-based discrimination Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo! in 2015, filed a lawsuit alleging that \\"Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of an employee performance-rating system to accommodate management‚Äôs subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo!‚Äôs male employees.\\" He claimed that, prior to his firing, he had received \\"fully satisfactory\\" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo!'s home page; however, he was relieved of his role, which was given to a woman who had been recently hired. This case was dismissed in March 2018. An earlier lawsuit was filed by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company‚Äôs performance management system was arbitrary and unfair and disguised layoffs as terminations for the purpose of evading state and federal WARN Acts, making it the first WARN Act and gender discrimination lawsuit Yahoo! and Mayer faced in 2016. = Lumi Labs (2017‚Äìpresent)= After leaving Yahoo! in 2017, Mayer started Lumi Labs with former colleague Enrique Munoz Torres. The company is based in Palo Alto and is focused on artificial intelligence and consumer media. Boards As well as sitting on the boards of directors of Walmart, Maisonette, and Jawbone, Mayer also sits on several non-profit boards, such as Cooper‚ÄìHewitt, National Design Museum, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maisonette-appoints-marissa- mayer-to-board-of-directors-300863849.html Business investments Mayer actively invests in technology companies, including crowd-sourced design retailer Minted, live video platform Airtime.com, wireless power startup uBeam, online DIY community/e-commerce company Brit + Co., mobile payments processor Square, home d√©cor site One Kings Lane, genetic testing company Natera, and nootropics and biohacking company Nootrobox.

It is usually presumed that the values are discrete, and thus time series mining is closely related, but usually considered a different activity. Sequential pattern mining is a special case of structured data mining. There are several key traditional computational problems addressed within this field. These include building efficient databases and indexes for sequence information, extracting the frequently occurring patterns, comparing sequences for similarity, and recovering missing sequence members. In general, sequence mining problems can be classified as string mining which is typically based on string processing algorithms and itemset mining which is typically based on association rule learning. Local process models extend sequential pattern mining to more complex patterns that can include (exclusive) choices, loops, and concurrency constructs in addition to the sequential ordering construct. String mining String mining typically deals with a limited alphabet for items that appear in a sequence, but the sequence itself may be typically very long. Examples of an alphabet can be those in the ASCII character set used in natural language text, nucleotide bases 'A', 'G', 'C' and 'T' in DNA sequences, or amino acids for protein sequences. In biology applications analysis of the arrangement of the alphabet in strings can be used to examine gene and protein sequences to determine their properties. Knowing the sequence of letters of a DNA or a protein is not an ultimate goal in itself. Rather, the major task is to understand the sequence, in terms of its structure and biological function. This is typically achieved first by identifying individual regions or structural units within each sequence and then assigning a function to each structural unit. In many cases this requires comparing a given sequence with previously studied ones. The comparison between the strings becomes complicated when insertions, deletions and mutations occur in a string. A survey and taxonomy of the key algorithms for sequence comparison for bioinformatics is presented by Abouelhoda & Ghanem (2010), which include: * Repeat-related problems: that deal with operations on single sequences and can be based on exact string matching or approximate string matching methods for finding dispersed fixed length and maximal length repeats, finding tandem repeats, and finding unique subsequences and missing (un-spelled) subsequences. * Alignment problems: that deal with comparison between strings by first aligning one or more sequences; examples of popular methods include BLAST for comparing a single sequence with multiple sequences in a database, and ClustalW for multiple alignments. Alignment algorithms can be based on either exact or approximate methods, and can also be classified as global alignments, semi-global alignments and local alignment. See sequence alignment. Itemset mining Some problems in sequence mining lend themselves to discovering frequent itemsets and the order they appear, for example, one is seeking rules of the form \\"if a {customer buys a car}, he or she is likely to {buy insurance} within 1 week\\", or in the context of stock prices, \\"if {Nokia up and Ericsson up}, it is likely that {Motorola up and Samsung up} within 2 days\\". Traditionally, itemset mining is used in marketing applications for discovering regularities between frequently co-occurring items in large transactions. For example, by analysing transactions of customer shopping baskets in a supermarket, one can produce a rule which reads \\"if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy hamburger meat in the same transaction\\". A survey and taxonomy of the key algorithms for item set mining is presented by Han et al. (2007). The two common techniques that are applied to sequence databases for frequent itemset mining are the influential apriori algorithm and the more- recent FP-growth technique. Applications With a great variation of products and user buying behaviors, shelf on which products are being displayed is one of the most important resources in retail environment. Retailers can not only increase their profit but, also decrease cost by proper management of shelf space allocation and products display. To solve this problem, George and Binu (2013) have proposed an approach to mine user buying patterns using PrefixSpan algorithm and place the products on shelves based on the order of mined purchasing patterns. Algorithms Commonly used algorithms include: * GSP algorithm * Sequential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence classes (SPADE) * FreeSpan * PrefixSpan * MAPres * Seq2Pat (for constraint-based sequential pattern mining) See also * Process mining * Sequence analysis (bioinformatics) * Sequence clustering * Sequence labeling References External links * SPMF includes open-source implementations of GSP, PrefixSpan, SPADE, SPAM and many others.

He died in 1066, the year his stepson conquered England. Conteville and Sainte-M√®re-√âglise No contemporary record provides the parentage for Herluin, although much later sources have assigned him parents (such as the otherwise unknown Jean de Conteville (965) and Harlette de Meulan). Herluin was a lord of moderate income and some land on the south side of the river Seine. He was viscount of Conteville, probably so created by his stepson, and held the honour of Sainte-M√®re-√âglise, a portion of the county of Mortain. There he founded the Grestain Abbey around 1050 with his son Robert.Freeman 1902, p. 112 and 382 Herluin's marriage to Herleva Towards the beginning of the 11th century, Conteville and its dependencies appear to be in the hands of Herluin, who married Herleva, the mistress of Robert I, Duke of Normandy and already mother of William the Bastard, called William the Conqueror later. Herluin and Herleva had two sons and two daughters: Odo or Eudes, who became Bishop of Bayeux, and Robert who became Count of Mortain; both were prominent in the reign of their half-brother William.

Its role was taken over by the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps in 1961 and, in 1967, by the U.S. Army Intelligence Agency. Its functions are now performed by its modern-day descendant organization; United States Army Counterintelligence. The National Counter Intelligence Corps Association (NCICA), a veterans' association, was established in the years immediately following World War II by Military Intelligence agents who had served in every area of military and domestic operations. The organization meets annually. Its newsletter, the Golden Sphinx, is published quarterly. U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps Special Agent Badge circa World War II Origins The CIC had its origins in the Corps of Intelligence Police founded by Ralph Van Deman in 1917. This organization, operating within the USA and on attachment to the American Expeditionary Force in France, at its peak numbered over 600 men. However, in the post-war period, the policy of isolationism, retrenchment of military spending and economic depression meant that by the mid-1930s its numbers had fallen to fewer than 20 personnel. World War II The looming threat of war in the late 1930s brought an expansion of the CIP back to its World War I levels, and the entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941 brought an even greater expansion, and a new name. On 13 December 1941 the Adjutant General of the Army issued an order renaming the CIP as the Counter Intelligence Corps, effective from 1 January 1942.\\"COUNTER-ESPIONAGE IS REVIVED BY ARMY: Corps Reorganized to Combat Sabotage and Disloyalty,\\" The New York Times, 13 January 1942; p. 11. A new complement of 543 officers and 4,431 non-commissioned agents was authorized. The CIC recruited men with legal, police or other investigative backgrounds, and particularly looked for men with foreign language skills. Special CIC teams were created during World War II in Europe, in large part from the Military Intelligence Service personnel (see Ritchie Boys). However, there were never enough of these and local interpreters were often recruited.\\"Counter Intelligence Corps: History and Mission in WWII\\", U.S. Army Military History Institute, Carlisle Barracks, PA 17013-5008. As most CIC agents in the field (as well as Military Intelligence Service in Europe) held only non-commissioned officer rank‚Äî corporals and various grades of sergeant‚Äî they wore either plain clothes, or uniforms without badges of rank; in place of rank insignia, and so as not to be perceived as privates, agents typically wore officer \\"U.S.\\" collar insignia. They were instructed to identify themselves only as \\"Agent\\" or \\"Special Agent\\" as appropriate, in order to facilitate their work. These practices continue among modern counterintelligence agents.Counter Intelligence in World War II Within the U.S. the CIC, in collaboration with the Provost Marshal General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), carried out background checks on military personnel having access to classified material, investigations of possible sabotage and subversion, and allegations of disloyalty, especially those directed against Americans of Japanese, Italian or German ancestry. Despite the prohibitions in the delimitation agreement with the FBI, the CIC ended up devoting considerable effort to civilian investigations. As Volume 7 of The History of the Counter Intelligence Corps explains: \\"Espionage and sabotage, being enemy directed, involved more than one person. Usually there were a number in the chain extending from the agent in the United States back through cutouts and couriers to the enemy country. This inevitably involved civilians with military suspects and the case became connected with the FBI. The military aspect became minor, and major investigative effort was in the civilian community to locate the higher-ups who presumably were controlling more than one agent.\\"The quotation is on p. 1093. For an account of CIC encroachment into territory designated by the chapter World War II: Expanding the Boundaries. However the use of informants within the Army became politically controversial, and CIC was forced to curtail its activities. In particular, the CIC was ordered to cease its domestic investigations, to destroy its investigative records, and to ship its agents out to overseas theaters.On 5 November 1943 the Army ordered all CIC agents out of Washington, D.C. On the following day, the Army Inspector General submitted a devastating report on the CIC. In February 1944 the position of Chief, Counter Intelligence Corps was abolished and CIC Headquarters was dissolved. The reason for this sudden and unprecedented expulsion has never been clarified. One leading theory was expressed in the official history of the Corps, \\"the speed [of these events] left little doubt that someone‚Äîpossibly Communists who still held key positions in government‚Äîwas determined to halt CIC investigative activities in the United States\\".The History of the Counter Intelligence Corps, p. 70. Another possible explanation is that the CIC mistakenly bugged the hotel room of Eleanor Roosevelt and incurred the President‚Äôs wrath. In any event, the CIC protected the investigative records it had so painstakingly accumulated. According to Sayer and Botting (p. 47) \\"When the command was given to cease any investigations of known or suspected Communists and destroy all files on such persons immediately, eight of the nine Corps Area Commanders took the remarkable step of disobeying this order\\". According to the official history of the Corps, this information proved highly valuable in controlling communism: \\"the information acquired by CIC from May 1941 to September 1945 regarding communism and its adherents played a major part in keeping communism under control in the United States ever since\\".The History of the Counter Intelligence Corps, volume 7, p. 1123. = Manhattan Project = CIC units were also involved in providing security for the Manhattan Project, including duty as couriers of fissionable bomb materials from Los Alamos, New Mexico to Tinian. They also operated in 1945 at the United Nations Organizing Conference in San Francisco, over which Alger Hiss presided as secretary-general.For the account of one agent working under cover at the San Francisco conference and photos of fellow agents there, see Special Agent Leonard L. (Igor) Gorin \\"United Nations Formation 1945‚ÄîCIC Security Role\\". Golden Sphinx, Serial Issue #2004-3, Winter 2004-5, pp. 16‚Äì20. Three years later, when Alger Hiss was accused of being a Communist and filed a libel suit against his accuser, his lawyers unwittingly hired an undercover CIC Special Agent as their Chief Investigator to help prepare his libel suit.See \\"Bringing Alger Hiss to Justice\\" by Stephen Salant. In the European and Pacific theaters of operations CIC deployed detachments at all levels. These detachments provided tactical intelligence about the enemy from captured documents, interrogations of captured troops, and from para-military and civilian sources. They were also involved in providing security for military installations and staging areas, located enemy agents, and acted to counter stay-behind networks. They also provided training to combat units in security, censorship, the seizure of documents, and the dangers of booby traps. In some cases CIC agents such as Henry Kissinger found themselves acting as the de facto military government on the occupation of large towns before the arrival of Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMGOT) officers. As the war in Europe came to a close, CIC were involved in the Operations Alsos, Paperclip and TICOM, searching for German personnel and research in atomic weapons, rockets and cryptography. Recruits after World War II included Klaus Barbie, also known as the 'Butcher from Lyon', a former Gestapo member and war criminal. Post-war operations =Operation Paperclip= At the end of World War II CIC agents were successful in an operation called ‚ÄúPaper Clip‚Äù that obtained German Rocket Scientists for America before the Soviets took them. This action aided in the success of the American rocket development program and resultant adventure into space. CIC actively continued counterintelligence activities in the Cold War, Korean War and Vietnam War. =Other activities= In the immediate post-war period, the CIC operated in the occupied countries, particularly Japan, Germany and Austria, countering the black market, and searching for and arresting notable members of the previous regime. Despite the problem of demobilization, with many experienced agents returning to civilian life, CIC became the leading intelligence organization in the American occupation zones, and very soon found themselves facing a new enemy in the emerging Cold War. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 meant that CIC was once again involved in a military conflict, and it underwent a major expansion. However this proved to be CIC's last chance to enjoy resources and recruits. The proliferation of intelligence agencies had meant duplication of effort and disputes over responsibility, so in 1961 the CIC ceased to exist as an independent organization, as it was rolled into the Army's new Military Intelligence Branch. While serving in the U.S. Army in the 1960s, Christopher H. Pyle learned that \\"Army intelligence had 1500 plain clothes agents watching every demonstration of 20 people or more throughout the United States\\". Pyle‚Äôs disclosures led to Congressional investigations and a crackdown on what was regarded as the Army‚Äôs investigative excesses. This ended what advocates regarded as the peak of counterintelligence efficiency: \\"At the height of the disturbance period, a CIC agent could get a report from the street to Fort Holabird HQ in 20 minutes, from practically any city in the U.S., seconds or brief minutes later the report was in Operations Center in a lower basement of the Pentagon\\".The quotation is from Ann Bray, one of the contributors to The History of the Counter Intelligence Corps. At the time of her death, she was writing a book on the Corps and this passage from its last chapter is quoted in Duval Edwards' account on pp. 281‚Äì2. The \\"ratline\\" controversy One of CIC's operations in post-war Europe was the operation of a \\"rat-line\\" ‚Äì a conduit for spiriting informants and defectors out of the Soviet Zones of Occupation to safety in South America, via Italy, with false identities paid for by CIC. However, in 1983 the arrest of former SS officer Klaus Barbie in Bolivia raised questions as to how the \\"Butcher of Lyon\\" had escaped. It was then revealed that Barbie had worked for CIC from 1947, and in 1951 had been provided with the means of escape in return for his services as an agent and informant. A Department of Justice investigation also uncovered the CIC's dealings with Father Krunoslav Draganoviƒá, a Croatian cleric based in Rome, who while working for CIC, also operated his own clandestine rat-line to transport Usta≈°e war criminals to Latin America. A further report in 1988 also examined the CIC's use of Nazi war criminals and collaborators as informants in the years after World War II, \\"In June 1988, Office of Special Investigations within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice issued a public report which revealed that at least 14 suspected Nazi war criminals, a number of whom likely were involved in the murder of Jews in occupied Europe, had been employed as intelligence informants by the CIC in Austria\\".\\"Implementation of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act: An Interim Report to Congress,\\" October, 1999 Notable CIC agents *Leroy Anderson, composer *Donald L.

Larn (March 1, 1849 - June 23, 1878) was a western American lawman and later outlaw who, with gunfighter John Selman, operated a cattle rustling ring in Shackelford County, Texas for over a year. Life Born in Mobile, Alabama, Larn traveled to Colorado as a teenager where he found work as a ranch hand until murdering his employer during an argument over a horse. Fleeing to New Mexico, Larn killed a local sheriff he had thought was tracking him. After settling in Fort Griffin, Texas, Larn once again was employed by local rancher Bill Hays as a trail boss. It was also around this time, while traveling to California, that Larn had supposedly murdered two Mexicans after an argument and had their bodies dumped in the Pecos River. Deciding to stay in Fort Griffin, Larn eventually married the daughter of John Alexander Matthews and within several years had become a well known citizen of Shackelford County. After years of service with the local vigilante committees, Larn was elected county sheriff in April 1876. Shortly after becoming elected, Larn agreed to a contract with the local territorial garrison to deliver three steers of cattle per day. Larn however, began planning with longtime friend and recently deputized John Selman to rustle cattle from neighboring ranchers in place of his own. Suspicions were soon raised as ranchers noticed while their herds were slowly shrinking, Larn's remained the only ranch unaffected and, after discovering the scheme, Larn was eventually forced to resign on March 7, 1877. No charges were brought against him however; Leslie continued to live in Shackelford County until June 1878 when Larn wounded a local rancher by the name of Treadwell (who had reportedly uncovered the cattle rustling). Larn was soon arrested by Sheriff William Cruger on June 22, 1878 and taken to Albany where Cruger ordered the local blacksmith to shackle Larn to the floor of the jail house as to prevent a breakout by Larn's supporters. However, when vigilantes from Fort Griffin arrived the following night, finding they could not lynch Larn they instead shot him as he was still shackled in his cell.

Biography He was born in the rural hamlet Kaldewei, part of the village of Benninghausen, Prussia, today suburbanized into Lippstadt, Northrhine, Westphalia, Germany. His parents Caspar Eickhoff (1803‚Äì1867) and Maria Catharina Trockel (1803‚Äì1863) and their forefathers were peasants in the hamlet Kaldewei, born in serfdom to the Cistercian Cloister of Benninghausen (founded in 1240, secularized in 1804), but ultimately released from serfdom by the Grand Duke in 1809. After his school education he started to work as a teacher in Lippstadt and publicized radical writings in pre- revolutionary Prussia until 1847. In 1847 he decided to emigrate to the United States and boarded the ship Itzstein & Welcker sailing from Bremen on October 24, 1847, and arrived in New Orleans on January 6, 1848. He married Louise Elisa Neuenschwander around 1855. She immigrated from Switzerland to the United States. Their children were Henry Eickhoff (January 17, 1856 ‚Äì October 17, 1933) and two daughters. Anthony Eickhoff's grandson was lawyer Henry Eickhoff, Jr. (February 17, 1898 ‚Äì August 12, 1954). =First profession and journalism (1848‚Äì1856)= His first employment was as deckhand on a Mississippi steamboat, later he became a teacher in a Jesuit school in St. Louis and studied law. Early he began to work as journalist, founder and editor of several German newspapers. In St. Louis, Missouri, he was founder and editor of St. Louis Zeitung in 1848 and 1849. In Dubuque, Iowa, he edited Der Nordwestliche Demokrat, later named Iowa Staatszeitung, from 1849 to 1850. In Louisville, Kentucky, it was Der Beobachter am Ohio, edited 1850‚Äì1852.

MCN is located near Grand Rapids, Manitoba, 400 kilometres North of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and is accessible via PTH 6. It is situated at the mouth of the Saskatchewan River as it runs into Lake Winnipeg. Misipawistik Cree Nation has one reserve (Grand Rapids 33) with an area of 1852.30 hectares and is governed by a chief and three councillors. The current Chief is Heidi Cook. It is a member of the Swampy Cree Tribal Council with offices in The Pas. History MCN is a Cree-speaking community in Northern Manitoba, Canada. The people of Misipawistik are largely ancestral descendants of indigenous Cree peoples who have populated the Canadian Shield region of northern and central Canada for 10,000 to 35,000 years. Cree peoples had been migrating to the area during the summer seasons for thousands of years prior to establishing a year-round settlement with the advent of the North American fur trade. Cree and Mixed families would continue to follow their seasonal cycles well into the latter half of the 20th century. Many famous Canadian figures would pass through Misipawistik on the way through to Western Canada as transportation at the time relied heavily on waterways prior to the late 1800s. Notably, Pierre La V√©rendrye would travel through and open up Fort Bourbon in 1741. By the late 1700s, Misipawistik would already be fully immersed in the North American Fur Trade. The area was considered a crucial point in the Fur Trade endeavour as most water-bound routes into the Northwest converged at this site. It was during this era that Misipawistik would become a year-round settlement for both Cree and M√©tis families as the Fur Trade would provide the economic means for some families to reside in the area year-round. During the 19th century, the Fur Trade would start to dwindle while other economic activities would begin to emerge. Fishing and trapping started to represent how families would sustain themselves economically and this would continue well into the 20th century. The Grand Rapids in 1921 =Treaty 5 Adhesion= The Cree people of Misipawistik had signed Treaty 5 in September 1875. According to Alexander Morris, the rationale behind the negotiation was due in part because of improvements in boating technology, but also because of the economic necessity of the region. As he would state in his self-written book, The Treaties of Canada with the Indians of Manitoba and the North-west Territories: \\"The progress of navigation by steamer on Lake Winnipeg, the establishment of Missions and of saw milling enterprises, the discovery of minerals on the shores and vicinity of the lake as well as migration of the Norway House Indians.\\" Initially, the Cree people negotiating an adhesion to Treaty 5 wished to have their reserve lands cover both sides of the Saskatchewan River entering into the Lake Winnipeg, but were nonetheless convinced to accept the Southern shore. The reason is still unclear as to how these negotiations played out. =National Cree Gathering 2007= Misipawistik Cree Nation hosted the 12th annual National Cree Gathering, a week-long event where Cree people from all over Canada and the United States came together to promote, preserve, and proclaim their traditional ceremonial practices, their distinct languages, and their ways of life. A central component of the National Cree Gathering is the 'Unity Run' which involves youth from multiple participating communities. These youth run the journey from the previous hosting community to the next hosting community. In certain years, this journey can encompass over 2000 kilometres. This year, the youth will be running from Moose Factory, Ontario to Misipawistik Cree Nation. Demographics With a population of approximately 716 members, Misipawistik is a small community compared to the average First Nations community. The population consists of Cree, Metis people, and other First Nations people. Cree, and English are the two languages most widely used.

Biography  Claude, born Claude Harrison Greene was the son of William Friese-Greene, a pioneer in early cinematography. He was the grandfather of musician and music producer Tim Friese-Greene.  Colour cinematography  Claude's father William began the development of an additive colour film process called Biocolour. This process produced the illusion of true colour by exposing each alternate frame of ordinary black-and-white film stock through two different coloured filters. Each alternate frame of the monochrome print was then stained red or green. Although the projection of Biocolour prints did provide a tolerable illusion of true colour, like the more famous Kinemacolor process of George Albert Smith it suffered from noticeable colour flicker (a potentially headache-inducing defect known technically as 'colour bombardment') and from red-and-green fringing around anything in the scene that moved very rapidly. In an attempt to overcome these problems, a faster-than-usual frame rate was used. After William's death in 1921, Claude Friese-Greene continued to develop the system during the 1920s and renamed the process Friese-Greene Natural Colour then the Spectrum Colour Film process. Claude went on to be a highly-respected cinematographer on more than 60 films from 1923 to 1943 and a was one of the first to shoot in Technicolor in Britain. He died as the result of an accident when filming at the Denham Film Studios in January 1943. In 2006, the BBC ran a series of programmes called The Lost World of Friese-Greene. The series, presented by Dan Cruickshank, included The Open Road, Claude Friese-Greene's film of his 1920s road trip from Land's End to John o' Groats. The Open Road was filmed using the Spectrum Colour Film process, and the British Film Institute used computer processing of the images to minimise the red and green fringes around rapidly moving objects.

In 1290, King Diniz created the first Portuguese University in Lisbon (later moved to Coimbra) and decreed that Portuguese, then called simply the \\"common language\\", would henceforth be used instead of Latin, and named the \\"Portuguese language\\". In 1296, it was adopted by the Royal Chancellary and began to be used for writing laws and in notaries. The medieval spelling of Portuguese was not uniform, since it had no official standard, but most authors used an essentially phonemic orthography, with minor concessions to etymology common in other Romance languages, such as the use of c for before e or i, but √ß otherwise, or the use of ss for between vowels, but s otherwise. King Diniz, who was an admirer of the poetry of the troubadours and a poet himself, popularized the Occitan digraphs nh and lh for the palatal consonants and , which until then had been spelled with several digraphs, including nn and ll, as in Spanish. During the Renaissance, appreciation for classical culture led many authors to imitate Latin and (Romanized) Ancient Greek, filling words with a profusion of silent letters and other etymological graphemes, such as ch (pronounced as c/qu), ph (pronounced as f), rh, th, y (pronounced as i), cc, pp, tt, mn (pronounced as n), sce, sci (pronounced as ce, ci), bt, pt, mpt (pronounced as t), and so on, still found today in the orthographies of French and English. Contrary to neighboring languages such as Spanish or French, whose orthographies were set by language academies in the 17th century, Portuguese had no official spelling until the early 20th century; authors wrote as they pleased. Orthographic standardization In 1911, the newly formed Portuguese Republic, concerned with improving the literacy of its citizens, charged a commission of philologists with defining a standard orthography for Portuguese. The result was what has come to be known in Portugal as the orthographic reform of Gon√ßalves Viana. The new standard became official in Portugal and its overseas territories at the time, which are today the independent nations of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, and East Timor, as well as the Chinese S.A.R. of Macau and the Indian state of Goa and territories of Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. In 1938, Brazil set up an orthography of its own, with the same general principles as the Portuguese orthography, but not entirely identical to it. =Basic principles= The authors of the first spelling reform of Portuguese, imbued with the modern ideas of phonology, rejected the etymological spellings current in the previous centuries, preferring a more phonetic orthography, like those of Spanish and Italian. On the other hand, considering that the period of Galician-Portuguese troubadorian poetry had been a golden age of Portuguese literature, they aimed to keep the new orthography as close to the medieval spelling as possible, in spite of some phonetic changes which the language had undergone. The resulting orthographic standard was essentially a compromise between these intents, on one hand, and common traditions, on the other: in a few cases, spelling conventions which went against etymology but had long become customary were made official. Thus, the reform kept some graphemic distinctions for phonological traits which were not present in every dialect, but still present in at least some areas: between z and intervocalic s ( and in medieval Portuguese, but now reduced to in most dialects), between c/√ß and s(s) ( and in medieval Portuguese, but now reduced to in most dialects), and between ch and x (originally and , now just in most dialects, although the distinction is still retained in some). The unstressed vowels e and o were also retained for word-family homogeneity and etymology when they were pronounced as i or u, respectively, and the digraph ou was differentiated from o, even though many speakers now pronounced both as . These distinctions have close parallels in the orthographies of other West European languages. Since word stress can be distinctive in Portuguese, the acute accent was used to mark the stressed vowel whenever it was not in the usual position, more or less as in the orthographies of Spanish and Catalan. For example, the verb critica \\"he criticizes\\" bears no accent mark, because it is stressed on the syllable before the last one, like most words that end in -a, but the noun cr√≠tica \\"criticism\\" requires an accent mark, since it is a proparoxytone. Since the height of the vowels a, e and o is also distinctive in stressed syllables (see Portuguese phonology), high stressed vowels were marked with a circumflex accent, √¢, √™, √¥, to be differentiated from the low stressed vowels written √°, √©, √≥. The choice of the acute for low vowels and the circumflex for high vowels went against the conventions of other Romance languages such as French or Italian, but it was already commonplace in Portuguese before the 20th century. (In many words, Portuguese √™ and √¥ correspond to the Latin long vowels ƒì, ≈ç.) Nasal vowels and nasal diphthongs usually appear before the orthographic nasal consonants n, m, in which case they do not need to be identified with diacritics, but the tilde was placed on nasal a and nasal o when they occurred before another letter, or at the end of a word. Although the vowel u can also be nasal before other vowels, this happens in so few words (mui, muito, muita, muitos, muitas) that marking its nasality was not considered necessary. The acute accent was used also to mark the second vowel of a hiatus in a stressed syllable, where a diphthong would normally be expected, distinguishing for example conclui \\"he concludes\\" from conclu√≠ \\"I concluded\\", saia \\"that he leave\\" from sa√≠a \\"he used to leave\\", or fluido \\"fluid\\" from flu√≠do \\"flowed\\". Initially, the orthographic system, both in Brazil and Portugal, determined the usage of diacritics in cases where two words would otherwise be homographic but not homophonous, such as ac√¥rdo, \\"agreement\\", distinguishing it from ac√≥rdo, \\"I wake up\\". This principle was abandoned in all but a dozen cases in 1945 in Portugal and in 1973 in Brazil. (In most cases the homographs were different parts of speech, meaning that context was enough to distinguish them.) The orthography set by the 1911 reform is essentially the one still in use today on both sides of the Atlantic with only minor adjustments having been made to the vowels, consonants, and digraphs. Since then, the only remaining significant differences between the two standards, and only substantial changes addressed in the 1990 spelling reform, were in the use of diacritics and silent consonants. Portuguese orthography vs. Brazilian orthography Brazil was never consulted about the orthographic reform of 1911, and so it did not adopt it. In the decades that followed, negotiations were held between representatives of Brazil and Portugal, with the intent of agreeing on a uniform orthography for Portuguese, but progress was slow. In 1931, Portugal and Brazil finally signed an orthographic agreement, on the basis of which Brazil established its own official orthography, in 1938. Soon after, however, it became apparent that there were differences between the spellings being used in the two countries. Even though both were based on the same general principles, phonetic differences between European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese had led to divergent spellings in some cases. Various attempts were made in the remainder of the 20th century to bring the two orthographies closer to each other, sometimes with modest success, other times without success. To this day, they do not coincide completely. =Problems with the original orthography= Notwithstanding its traces of etymology, the 1911 orthography aimed to be phonetic in the sense that, given the spelling of a word, there would be no ambiguity about its pronunciation. For that reason, it had certain characteristics which later produced inconsistencies between the European and the Brazilian orthographies. In unstressed syllables, hiatuses were originally distinguished from diphthongs with a trema. For instance, writing sa√ºdade, tra√Ødor, constitu√Ø√ß√£o, so that they would be pronounced sa-udade, tra-idor, constitu-i√ß√£o. But the pronunciation of these words is not uniform. Many speakers say sau-dade and trai-dor, especially in fast speech. Furthermore, there are no minimal pairs that distinguish a hiatus from a falling diphthong in unstressed syllables. For this reason, marking unstressed hiatuses came to be seen as unnecessary, and these tremas were eventually abolished. The trema was also used in the words where the letter u is, exceptionally, pronounced in the digraphs gue, gui, que, qui, rather than silent as usual; e.g. ag√ºentar, sag√ºim, freq√ºente, eq√ºidade. However, there is regional variation, with for example the u being pronounced in a few Brazilian Portuguese accents q√ºest√£o, but not in European Portuguese quest√£o. Although the number of words with such divergent pronunciations is small, they have been seen as an obstacle to the orthographic unification of the language. Unstressed vowels are usually high, but there are exceptions, including a few pairs of homographs in European Portuguese which vary only in having either a low or a high vowel in an unstressed syllable. To distinguish these, the grave accent was at first placed on unstressed low vowels: cf. pregar \\"to nail\\", where the e is pronounced in European Portuguese, with pr√®gar \\"to preach\\", where √® is pronounced , or molhada \\"wet\\" with m√≤lhada \\"bundle\\". But in Brazilian Portuguese both words in each example are pronounced the same way, so the grave accent is not used: pregar \\"to nail/to preach\\", molhada \\"wet/bundle\\"; the intended meaning is inferred from context. The grave accent was eventually abolished, except in a small number of contractions. In other cases, where an unstressed low vowel was the result of the elision of the consonants c or p before c, √ß, t, the consonant was kept in the spelling, to denote the quality of the preceding vowel. For example, in the word intercep√ß√£o, which is stressed on its last syllable, the letter p is not pronounced, but indicates that the second e is pronounced , as opposed to the second e in intercess√£o, which is pronounced . Other examples of words where a silent consonant was left to lower the previous vowel are objec√ß√£o and factor. In Brazilian Portuguese, the vowels in question are pronounced just like any other unstressed vowels, and, since there is no phonetic ambiguity to undo, the words are simply spelled obje√ß√£o, fator, and so on. The orthography distinguished between stressed √©i and stressed ei. In Brazilian Portuguese, these diphthongs are indeed different, but in most dialects of European Portuguese both are pronounced the same way, and √©i appears only by convention in some oxytone plural nouns and adjectives. This led to divergent spellings such as id√©ia (Brazil) and ideia (Portugal). The Brazilian spelling has a, √™ or √¥ in several words where the European orthography has √°, √© or √≥, due to different pronunciation. For example, cf. pensamos, g√™nero, t√¥nico (Brazil) with pens√°mos, g√©nero, t√≥nico (Portugal). This happens when the vowels are stressed before the nasal consonants m or n, followed by another vowel, in which case both types of vowel may occur in European Portuguese, but Brazilian Portuguese allows only high vowels. Timeline of spelling reforms * 1911: First spelling reform in Portugal. * 1931: Orthographic agreement between Portugal and Brazil. Silent s abolished from words such as sci√™ncia, scena, sc√©ptico, etc., and spellings like dir-se h√° and amar-te hei changed to dir- se-√° and amar-te-ei. * 1937: First proposal of orthographic reform in Brazil is mentioned by the Constitution but not enforced. * 1943: First orthographic reform of Brazil is delineated in the Vocabul√°rio Ortogr√°fico da L√≠ngua Portuguesa, by the Academia Brasileira de Letras. * 1945: Sweeping spelling reform in Portugal eliminates the trema, and differential circumflex accents in most pairs of homographs such as ac√™rto and acerto, c√™rca and cerca, c√¥r and cor, f√¥ra and fora, d√™sse and desse, and so on. * 1946: The Constitution of Brazil makes the orthographic reform of 1943 official and mandates that all books published in the country use the official spelling. * 1971: Sweeping spelling reform in Brazil eliminates the trema in hiatuses, most differential circumflexes, and accent marks on vowels with secondary stressed syllables in compounds, such as r√†pidamente, √πltimamente, cort√™smente, caf√®zinho, and so on. This reform was mockingly nicknamed the \\"Remington Reform\\" because it reduced dramatically the number of words bearing accents (the reference is to Remington Rand, which manufactured both typewriters and rifles in Brazil, either because the reform made typewriting easier or because it \\"executed\\" a large number of diacritics). * 1973: Portugal follows Brazil in abolishing accent marks in secondary stressed syllables. * 1986: Brazil invites the other six Portuguese language countries, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, to a meeting in Rio de Janeiro to address the remaining problems. A radical reform which would eliminate the acute accent and the circumflex accent from all words except oxytones (as in the orthography of Italian) is proposed but abandoned after a negative reception by both the Brazilian and Portuguese media and public. * 1990: A new orthographic agreement is reached between Brazil, Portugal and the other Portuguese-speaking countries. Not so radical as the 1986 attempt, it proposes a compromise between the two orthographic systems. * 2009: The new 1990 spelling reform goes into effect in Brazil and in Portugal, changing the rules of capitalization and hyphen usage, eliminating the trema completely from the language (except for foreign words), changing the diphthongs \\"√©i\\" and \\"√≥i\\" into \\"ei\\" and \\"oi\\" respectively in paroxytone words that don't end with a coda /r/, and eliminating silent letters as in ac√ß√£o or √≥ptimo, which are now spelled a√ß√£o and √≥timo. * 2016: The transitional period in Brazil, during which both orthographies co-existed, ends.Brazilian Federal Decree 7875 of 2012 extended the transition through December 2015. Only the new orthography is official from January 2016. Orthographic Agreement of 1990 In 1990, an orthographic agreement was reached between the Portuguese-language countries with the intent of creating a single common orthography for Portuguese. This spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on January 1, 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2008, allowing for a six-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies co-existed. The legality of this decision is questioned, as the main bases of the International Treaty that governs the application of the new spelling reform are yet to be established, chiefly the common vocabulary drawn by all participating countries, that still does not exist. Also, the application of International Treaties, as per the Vienna Convention, states that the text of a treaty cannot be changed, and this one has suffered at least two revisions.

The tunnel crosses the Cascade Range about south of the pass, which is used by Interstate 90, on the border between King County and Kittitas County. It is long and is at an approximate elevation of above sea level, just north of Keechelus Lake. Its east portal is at Hyak. The tunnel was originally constructed for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in the early 1910s and was abandoned in 1980. It now serves as part of a rail trail in Iron Horse State Park, known officially as the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail. The trail was formerly known as the John Wayne Pioneer Trail and commonly called the Iron Horse Trail. A major renovation to the walls, ceiling, and path were completed in July 2011 after a two-year closure.  History  The tunnel was constructed from 1912‚Äì1914 by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (\\"The Milwaukee Road\\") as part of its line from Chicago to Seattle, completed in 1909. It replaced a temporary surface line over Snoqualmie Pass at ; this grade from Hyak to Rockdale later became U.S. Route 10, now the eastbound lanes of I-90. The tunnel is aligned east-west and electrification in 1917 eliminated smoke dissipation issues. In 1980, the Milwaukee Road received approval from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon its lines west of eastern Montana. On March 15, 1980, the final Milwaukee Road train passed through the tunnel. Later, the State of Washington acquired the right-of-way for recreational use. Today the tunnel is part of the Iron Horse State Park rails-to-trails project. It is usually closed between November 1 through early May due to ice formations inside the tunnel. On July 5, 2011 the tunnel re- opened after 11 months of renovations. The $700,000 renovation added a layer of concrete to the walls and ceiling, a reinforced structure, and a new and improved walking surface of crushed rock.

History It was founded in about 1134 by Saint Stephen of Obazine, who after his ordination, with another priest, Pierre, began the eremitical life. They attracted a number of followers and with the sanction of Eustorge, Bishop of Tulle, built a monastery on a site granted them by the Viscount Archambault. Before 1142 they had no established rule; however, in this year, St. Stephen was clothed with the regular habit. He had Cistercian monks train his followers in their mode of life, and affiliated his abbey to that of C√Æteaux in 1147. As their number increased, several foundations were made. Before the cistercian affiliation, the Abbey had a feminine monastery in Coyroux with a high closure. In C√Æteaux, this organization wasn't common, but it improved the good reputation of Obazine. The Obazine Abbey had foundations in Limousin and Quercy, as farms all around Rocamadour, a famous sacred place of pilgrimage. These cistercian farms were situated in Alix, Cal√®s, Bonnecoste, Couzou, Carlucet, near S√©niergues, and the last la Pannonie. That ring of cistercian presence in Quercy could furnish wood and food to pilgrims, to monks of Rocamadour and to Obazine. But they couldn't survive after the Hundred Years' War. Part of them became little castles as la Pannonie and Bonnecoste. Others disappeared. Among the most distinguished abbots of Obazine were Fran√ßois d'Escobleau (d. 1628), Archbishop of Bordeaux, and Charles de la Roche-Aymon (d. 1777), Cardinal Archbishop of Reims. The abbey was suppressed and its property confiscated by the government during the French Revolution in 1791. The government then converted the abbey into a bordello for the remainder of the decade. Church The structure of the abbey church survived the Revolution and now after restoration serves as the parish church of Aubazines.

It started as a sketch on another Televisa show, called La Parodia, that parodies political, social and cultural events happening in Mexico. High ratings kept the show running. It was first broadcast on October 25, 2004, during La Parodia. Soon, the high success of the program encouraged the producers to separate it from the other show, so on January 3, 2005, it became an independent show. Televisa broadcast what is considered the last episode of the series on July 9, 2006, just after the federal elections in Mexico. However, some of the actors who performed leading roles (such as Arath de la Torre, who played the role of presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Roberto Madrazo) stated that in a few years, when political events have advanced, they will make a return to see how things are. History In September 2004, La Parodia was one of the most successful shows on Mexican television. Characters presented here first would later appear on El Privilegio de Mandar, like \\"Chente\\" and \\"Andr√©s Manuel\\". The idea of the name \\"Privilegio\\" emerged from a skit on the famous Mexican telenovela El Privilegio de Amar (The privilege of loving), so the main title was presented with golden letters and slide images, just like a telenovela. This show was first aired as a section on La Parodia, on Monday October 25, 2004, at 10pm with its first episode, \\"El Informe\\". This quickly became such a success that from January 3, 2005 it became a show in its own right, La Parodia now being broadcast on Sundays. In September of the same year, Alter Films released a DVD containing the first ten broadcast episodes of El Privilegio de Mandar. The show followed closely the world of the Mexican and even foreign politics, from the 2004 videoscandals and the Desafuero judges to the last 2006 Mexican general elections. During its broadcast, the show had several guest artists, like Consuelo Duval (from La Hora Pico and La Familia P.Luche). It won the 2005 TVyNovelas Award for Best Comic Program. The show made history as the first political parody ever aired in Mexico, where every single political person was parodied. On Saturday July 8, Televisa broadcast a special programme hosted by Mexican entertainer and actor Ernesto Laguardia, in which scenes were presented from the first episodes of the show, interviews with the actors and the people parodied, as well as \\"behind the scenes\\" specials. Televisa broadcast the last episode of what is considered the first season on July 9, 2006, just after the federal elections in Mexico. From 2004, there have appeared around 50 different characters. The January 7, 2011 edition of NuestroDetroit.com, however, reported that a second season may soon be in production with Reynaldo Lopez taking over executive producing duties. The report went on to say that at least four actors‚Äîde la Torre, the Ortega brothers, and Vale‚Äîwill return to the series.Angelica Vale quiere regalo de 50 mil pesos, NuestroDetroit.com, January 7, 2011. Synopsis As a parody, it is kind of predictable knowing what will happen the next episode. The only thing the viewer has to do is follow the political news. For example, in 2004, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador had problems with the law, confronting a desafuero judge, so in the show all the trouble was parodied for months. Not all the shows are directly related to real politics, although there is usually some political context. In February 2006, Bailando Por Un Sue√±o (Dancing for a Dream) was highest rating show on Televisa, El Privilegio de Mandar parodied the show as Bailando Por Un Hueso (Dancing for a Bone) a double meaning because Hueso in this context is an expression for an influence, the participants were the politicians dancing, with the idea that the winner would get some political position or influence as a result. On El Privilegio de Mandar, Mexico is parodied as \\"Colonia el Relaxo con x\\" (\\"Relaxo\\" means \\"mess\\" in Spanish. The real word is \\"relajo\\", but the \\"j\\" is changed to \\"x\\" like the one in \\"Mexico\\"), representing the bad organization of the political world in that country. The states are represented as \\"Manzanas\\" (blocks), and the president as the president of the neighbors' association. Many of the parodied names and places are word-plays in Spanish, so they wouldn't be understood by many English or other languages speakers.

Final episode Episode 79: \\"The elections\\". The last episode of what's considered the first season was aired at 10pm on Sunday July 9, 2006. A special TV programme was wired presenting early scenes from \\"El privilegio de mandar\\" in 2004, interviews with some parodied politics and with the actors, their feelings and \\"behind the scene\\" specials. Real facts *AMLO arrived early at 8am to vote on Sunday July 2 *A special cover was hosted by Televisa journalist on the day of the elections *At night, Calder√≥n and L√≥pez Obrador celebrated their triumphs over the other, with people supporting them, without even knowing who had won *On July 6, the official counting was finished and declared Felipe Calder√≥n President-elect. *Andr√©s Manuel battled against the results and call to a meeting at Mexico City's Z√≥calo *Roberto Madrazo lost over 10 points under the nearest candidate Parody The show takes off with Andr√©s Manuel waiting for the IFE to open the polls at 7am on Sunday July 2, when the polls were actually opened at 8am (as a parody of the early arrive to the polls of the real Andr√©s Manuel).

After the elections, \\"Ugalde\\" (parody to IFE's president) made an announcement on TV, saying that he couldn't give an official winner because two candidates (Felipe and Andr√©s Manuel) were head to head so it wasn't time to celebrate yet. The scene changes and shows Felipe celebrating with balloons and all the people supporting him: *- (Crowd, cheering) Felipe!, Felipe!, Felipe! *- (Felipe, happy) Friends, that disobedient boy (Disobedient boy is a mariachi song sung by Vicente Fox in a TV show during his campaign) said it!, I'm the next president!. And I'm sorry for Andr√©s Manuel that must be very sad The scene changes again, now to Andr√©s Manuel: *- (Crowd, cheering) Andr√©s Manuel!, Andr√©s Manuel!, Andr√©s Manuel! *- (Andr√©s Manuel, happy) I am president!. I won for over five hundred thousand votes! However, the scene changes once more, now to Roberto, in his house sat down and paralysed in front of the TV. Soon the door rings: *- (Roberto, sitting next to Mariano Palacios) The doorbell rings Mariano. Open the door; it could be a vote. The day now changes to Thursday July 6, when the official counting was finished and declared Felipe winner of the election. However, Andr√©s Manuel is very angry, and calls to a demonstration: *- (Andr√©s Manuel, angry) We have to do a meeting at Saturday 8 at the Z√≥calo for battling against the polls! (Talking to Jes√∫s Ortega) *- (Jes√∫s Ortega) Why not Sunday 9 morning? *- (Andr√©s Manuel) No Jes√∫s, is the final match of the World Cup! *- (Jes√∫s Ortega) And why not Sunday 9 night? *- (Andr√©s Manuel) No, it's the final episode of \\"El Privilegio de Mandar\\" Finally, the scene of the meeting of Andr√©s Manuel is presented.

The show ends with all the crowd cheering \\"M√©xico!, M√©xico!, M√©xico!\\", a screen showing \\"¬øFin?\\" (The End?) and all the actors thanking the viewers for their support. Jokes on this episode *Joaqu√≠n Loque-N√≥sidga, talking about the great coverage of Televisa of the elections by their reporters: **-(Joaqu√≠n) We've got a reporter and a camera on every state, on every district, on every poll, on every crayon. *Roberto has voted and now goes up to Mariano Palacios (his consultant): **- (Mariano, proud) Hey Roberto! You know what?, I voted against Felipe! (Roberto's rival) **- (Roberto, curious) And how did you vote against Felipe, Mariano? **- (Mariano, proud) I marked him with a cross! (Note: mark the candidate space with a cross means a vote) *Mario de Tin Mar√≠n hadn't respected the line and he was voting. The crowd protests about that selfish act: **- (Mario de Tin Mar√≠n, smiling) Calm down, as if you were gods! Troubles with politicians Andr√©s M. L√≥pez Obrador criticised the show as making fun of him personally and as a strategy of the media to attack him because he felt that the amount of time dedicated to him was excessive in relation to other politicians. However, the show continued to broadcast parodies of him. V√≠ctor Gonz√°lez Torres also criticized the show as making fun of his way of talking, as he has physical problems. After 2006 elections, changes to the laws were provided to warn any television propaganda in favor or against a candidate, preventing Televisa to do another season of El Privilegio de Mandar. Common phrases and jokes =Chente= *\\"No Marthita\\" (complaining about what his wife says) *He often wears boots, as the real person *Several one-liners used in his campaign and presidential cycle were used to ridiculize the President acts. *Everytime the president says something aggressive to others, Vocero appears from nothing telling \\"That Chente really want to say is...\\") =Felipe Calder√≥n= *He is referred to sometimes as \\"Jelipe\\", as a common bad pronunciation of the letter F. *He waves his left arm up and down, as the real person. When doing this there was a funny cartoon sound effect. *Jokes with the real political campaign \\"Manos limpias\\" (clean hands), **\\"Since I have to keep my hands clean, a few days ago, I couldn't play with my daughter to Play-Doh! **\\"Since I have to keep my hands clean, the last day, my wife had to replace our SUV's wheel! **\\"Since I have to keep my hands clean, the last day, I ate a taco with a spoon! =Andr√©s Manuel= *The mispronunciation of the letters C and S, commonly between people from the Mexican Southeast *Parody of the pauses the real person makes while he is speaking *He always has his hair bad bruised so he had some hairs on the backhead lift up. He mentioned this portion of hair as his \\"Gallito Feliz\\" and sing a children song about it (Gallo in Mexico is a portion of hair bad bruised... literally translated to \\"Happy Rooster\\"). This gag is joking at the point that the real person woke up early the press to give a daily conference press as Mayor of Mexico City, and sometimes he arrived without bruising his hair properly. *Fear from Carlos Salinas de Gortari, he always mentions him as \\"El Innombrable\\" (The one must not be named) in a similar way to Harry Potter's Voldemort.In an episode he fights Darth Vader and when he is defeated he reveals to be \\"El Innombrable\\" and then Salinas said that Peje is his son. Memorable phrases **\\"A estas encuestas s√≠ les creo porque voy ganando\\" (I do believe in this polls because I am winning); after the polls from June 23, when he was winning **\\"Que poca... ¬°eso no es cierto!\\" (Son of a... that's not true!); used several times **\\"¬°Esto es un compl√≥!\\" (This is a complot!); every time he feels cornered about a situation that everybody is blaming on him even that he was the real cause. The phrase was original from Mexican Big Brother reality show where some participants plotted to nominate another participant. Indeed, when the real person said that he was plotted in a political ruse to get him expelled of the elections, in the comedy the characters participated in a Big Brother style reality show and he was the first to be nominated because he break some of the rules in order to attend his morning conference, at the end he replies \\"This is a complot!\\". **\\"¬°Callese, cha-cha-la-ca!\\" (Shut up you insignificant thing!); Chachalaca is a very small animal, and it was used frequently after the real one said this to the President during his campaign. In the program he used to shut up another characters. =Roberto= *Use always of the phrase \\"Amigo\\" (my friend) anytime he talks to somebody *He laughs in a very noisy way *Reference for the strongness of his last name (\\"Madrazo\\" is often an offensive word in Spanish for \\"hit\\") sometimes making him to get hit by something. *Incredible fear from Elba Esther Gordillo =Ren√© Bejarano= *He never laughs. Instead, he covers his mouth with his hand and shakes his head like he was laughing *He uses his bills to blow his nose, clean his face, etc. *He ends his phrases in an upper tone than the one he started them *He always ensure to do not forget the rubbers. Memorable phrases **\\"Dondequiera que est√©, nadie, absolutamente nadie, me podr√° quitar mi derecho de so√±ar\\" (Wherever I am, nobody, nobody at all will ever take from me my right for dreaming); at his desafuero judge. **\\"Me siento como un billete dentro de un portafolios\\" (I feel like a bill trapped inside a briefcase); being in jail. DVD In 2005, 10 early episodes from September‚ÄìNovember 2004 were released on a double-face DVD format. This DVD edition is still available in some music stores in Mexico. These episodes include all the desafuero judge to Bejarano and the videoscandals. =Synopsis= Episode 6: \\"Derecho de so√±ar\\" (Right for dreaming); is about Bejarano's desafuero judge. Two police officers (\\"polecias\\", as a parody of the ignorance of some police officers in Mexico) are waiting for Bejarano to come out of his house. The frame changes to the room of Bejarano, where he is packing his clothes. Later, in the desafuero judge, he starts avoiding the judge's questions: Part of the dialogue: *(Bejarano): \\"I know, you all have seen the video of me receiving money from Ahumada. The thing that really disappoints me is that, existing an original version, you all have seen a fake copy. Now, our partner Dolores (referring to his wife) will give you original videos that you'll can buy for a low price\\" *(Judge): \\"And the cash Ren√©?\\" (In Spanish: ¬øY la lana Ren√©?) (lana is a form to say money or cash in Mexico) *(Bejarano): \\"La Rana Ren√© est√° con los Muppets\\" (Kermit the Frog is with the Muppets) (Joking of the pronunciation of lana=rana) (Rana Ren√© is the name of Kermit the Frog in Mexico) * (Judge, after finishing the judgement): \\"What does the people says?!! (¬øQu√© es lo que dice el p√∫blico?) * (Crowd, furious): \\"Out!\\" \\"Out!\\" (¬°Fuera, fuera!) (this is parody of the TV Show Sabado Gigante) *(Bejarano): \\"Finally for finish, wherever I am, nobody, nobody at all will ever take from me my right for dreaming\\" *(Crowd): \\"Out\\"! \\"Out!\\" * (The frame changes and Bejarano is trapped in jail, before he wakes up and realizes he was dreaming), after this, other characters also dream, specially Peje where he dreams fighting Carlos Salinas dressed as Star Wars characters, Salinas, dressed as Darth Vader, rips Peje's \\"gallito feliz\\" and then removes his mask to show his identity and revealing to be his father.

Written by John of Salisbury around 1159, it belongs to the genre of advice literature known as \\"mirrors for princes\\", and is addressed to the territorial ruler. Though it takes up a wide variety of ethical questions, it is most famous for attempting to define the responsibilities of kings and their relationship to their subjects. Definitions Policraticus is a pseudo Greco-Roman neologism term, meaning \\"the statesman.\\" Salisbury drew his arguments from several different sources, including the Bible and the Justinian Code. He argued for the divine right of kings, saying that > ...the prince stands on a pinnacle which is exalted and made splendid with > all the great and high privileges which he deems necessary for himself. And > rightly so, because nothing is more advantageous to the people than that the > needs of the prince should be fully satisfied; since it is impossible that > his will should be found opposed to justice. Therefore, according to the > usual definition, the prince is the public power, and a kind of likeness on > earth of the divine majesty. Beyond doubt a large share of the divine power > is shown to be in princes by the fact that at their nod men bow their necks > and for the most part offer up their heads to the axe to be struck off, and, > as by a divine impulse, the prince is feared by each of those over whom he > is set as an object of fear. And this I do not think could be, except as a > result of the will of God. For all power is from the Lord God, and has been > with Him always, and is from everlasting. This divine source allowed princes to wage just wars and required all subjects to submit to the prince's will. Salisbury argued that the prince had four responsibilities: Revere God, adore his subjects, exert self-discipline and instruct his ministers. Salisbury advocated strict punishments for l√®se majest√©, but argued that a prince should err on the side of mercy and compassion when enforcing his laws. Tyrannicide While recognizing a prince's supreme temporal power, Salisbury argued that princes must be subordinate to the will of God and the Church. > For myself, I am satisfied and persuaded that loyal shoulders should uphold > the power of the ruler; and not only do I submit to his power patiently, but > with pleasure, so long as it is exercised in subjection to God and follows > His ordinances. But on the other hand if it resists and opposes the divine > commandments, and wishes to make me share in its war against God; then with > unrestrained voice I answer back that God must be preferred before any man > on earth. Therefore inferiors should cleave and cohere to their superiors, > and all the limbs should be in subjection to the head; but always and only > on condition that religion is kept inviolate. In Salisbury's mind, a tyrant sets a poor example for his people and could lead them from God. His example was the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate, who attempted to restore Rome's pagan religion. In this case, Salisbury argued that killing a regent, when all other resources were exhausted, was not only justifiable but necessary, and he called a tyrant an \\"image of depravity . . . [who] spring(s) from evil and should be cut down with the axe wherever he grows.\\" This may be the first defense of tyrannicide to be written after Antiquity.

The Eversons also built a number of cars and a gyrocopter. Evo The Evo was built in the late 1920s by Ernest and Arthur Everson of 9 Sentinel Road, Herne Bay. Evo was powered by a Henderson motor cycle engine. News of their construction was reported in 1928, with interest being shown in national newspapers.\\"Aucklanders' feat\\", Evening Post, Volume CVI, Issue 61, 24 September 1928, Page 11 Ernest was described as the aircraft's designer. He was a draughtsman and had a keen interest in aircraft, having built a number of successful models. Neither he nor his brother had any flying experience.\\"Monoplane built\\", Evening Post, Volume CVI, Issue 87, 22 October 1928, Page 8 Despite an attempt at flying the machine at the Mangere speedway on 10 July 1929 it never actually flew, but crashed attempting to take off. The Auckland Sun had reported a flight by the aircraft but this had turned out to be a hoax, possibly perpetrated by the brothers and their friends. The competing New Zealand Truth made much of its rival's error. The paper went on to say that the local Auckland Aero Club had refused the boys permission to use their field at Mangere because they considered the plane a hazard.\\"Was it a flight of fancy?\\" NZ Truth, Issue 1232, 11 July 1929, Page 2 The boys were aged 20 and 18 respectively at the time. Evo II Undeterred by their first failure, Ernest and Arthur began construction of Evo II. After trying out a 23-horsepower motor-cycle engine (probably the Henderson from Evo I), they installed an 80 hp Hall-Scott engine. On 3 December 1930 they took the plane to Muriwai beach for its first and last flight. The flight was on 4 December 1930 but ended when, after lifting off to about 20 feet in the air, the wing broke and the plane crashed. The brothers survived the crash with only a few scratches and bruises. The plane, however, was a writeoff.\\"Plane crashes\\", Auckland Star, Issue LXI, 5 December 1930, Page 9 Evo III Against this background the brothers' decision to enter the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race between England and Australia seemed ambitious, but they came surprisingly close to achieving their goal with the Evo III.\\"N.Z.

Takeoff required a 250-yard runway. The aircraft's landing speed was given as about 28 mph. With auxiliary fuel tanks, the range was estimated as being 1,500 miles at a cruising speed of 100 mph. The plane was expected to reach a 10,000 foot altitude with relative ease.\\"Success\\", Auckland Star, Volume LXV, Issue 128, 1 June 1934, Page 5 The Evo III was then flown to Hobsonville to be assessed by the NZPAF, where it failed to obtain a certificate of airworthiness, due to the proximity of the propellers to the (open) cockpit and the poor view on approach for landing.Home builts and miscellaneous types, R T Alexander, High adventures - from balloons to Boeings, NAC, 1968, pages 44-45 Although both problems could be rectified by a rebuild, the brothers now had no hope of making the 20 October start of the race, and development of the Evo III ceased. Two other New Zealand aircraft competed in the race, without placing. The Evo III was placed in storage at Te Kauwhata and was believed to have remained there until the 1960s. Its fate is unknown. Everson Cherub Between 1935 and 1937 the Everson brothers designed and built a small two-seater motor car, named the Everson Cherub. It had a streamlined design, tubular steel chassis, independent suspension, rear mounted 2.5 horsepowered two-stroke single-cylinder engine, three-speed gearbox, and twin exhausts. The car was just over four feet high and weighted about 800 lbs. Its top speed was over 50 mph, with a cruising speed of 30-35 mph and fuel consumption of about 70 mpg.\\"Home-made car\\", New Zealand Herald, Volume LXXIV, Issue 22754, 14 June 1937, Page 11 A least two more one-off models were made by the brothers.

The museum was founded in 1912 as the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts in honor of the artist Howard Pyle. The collection focuses on American art and illustration from the 19th to the 21st century, and on the English Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood movement of the mid-19th century. The museum building was expanded and renovated in 2005 and includes a Sculpture Park, the Helen Farr Sloan Library and Archives, studio art classes, a children's learning area, as well as a cafe and museum store. History The museum was founded in 1912 after Howard Pyle's death as the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts (WSFA), with over 100 paintings, drawings, and prints purchased from Pyle's widow Anne. Pyle was the best-known American illustrator of his day; he died unexpectedly in 1911 while on a trip to Italy. Who shall be captain? an 1911 painting by Howard Pyle at the museum Pyle left behind many students and patrons in his home town of Wilmington who wished to honor his memory through the museum, including Frank Schoonover, Stanley Arthurs, and Louisa du Pont Copeland. The museum's charter stated its purpose \\"to promote the knowledge and enjoyment of and cultivation in the fine arts in the State of Delaware.\\" From 1912 to 1922, the WSFA did not have a permanent home. It held annual exhibitions at the Hotel duPont of work by Pyle, as well as juried exhibitions of his pupils and other Delaware artists. The Pyle Collection continued to grow due to the largess of Willard S. Morse, who gave over 100 Pyle pen and ink drawings to the WSFA between 1915 and 1919. In 1922, the WSFA rented three rooms in the New Library Building on the corner of 10th and Market Streets in downtown Wilmington. In 2005, the DAM took out a $24.8 million loan in the form of tax-exempt bonds (to be repaid by 2037) in order to finance an ambitious $32.5 million doubling in size of its building.Daniel Grant (July 31, 2019), Building on credit: why museums like Lacma use bonds to fund ambitious expansions The Art Newspaper. During the 2008 financial crisis, its endowment dropped from $33 million to $21 million. In response, the museum sold $30 million worth of art from its collection in order to repay its loans and increase its endowment, a move that brought sanctions from the Association of Art Museum Directors. Bancroft donation Portrait of Elizabeth Siddal by Pre-Raphaelite Dante Gabriel Rossetti, c. 1854 In 1931, the estate of Samuel Bancroft contacted the WSFA with an offer to donate a collection of Pre- Raphaelite works, along with 11 acres of land to house a museum for the collection. Bancroft acquired the collection beginning in the 1890s and it is the \\"largest and most important collection of British Pre-Raphaelite art and manuscript materials in the United States.\\" Despite the hardships of the Great Depression, the WSFA raised $350,000 for the new building which opened in 1938. At the same time, the name was changed to Delaware Art Center. Expansion The WSFA moved into the Delaware Art Center in June 1938, with the Wilmington Academy of Fine Arts running educational programs on the ground floor. The onset of World War II resulted in strict gas rationing, which drastically reduced the attendance to the museum. The Wilmington Academy of Fine Arts disbanded in 1943 and turned its assets over to the Delaware Art Center, forming the basis of its education department, which grew to more than 500 students by 1954. The rapid growth of educational programs after World War II required the Delaware Art Center to expand by 1956. Studios and training facilities were included in the expansion, thanks to a $300,000 donation by H. Fletcher Brown. A further renovation was completed in 1970, adding air conditioning and humidity control to the building. In 1972, the Delaware Art Center was awarded accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums. Shortly thereafter, the Delaware Art Center was renamed the Delaware Art Museum to \\"reflect the growing strength of its collections, programs, and constituency.\\" A further expansion was completed in 1987 which effectively doubled the size of the museum. However, the rapid growth of attendance, programming, and outreach required a further expansion in 2005. During the expansion, the museum hosted programming at what is now the Chase Center on the Riverfront. Collections The Delaware Art Museum's collections are predominantly drawn from late 19th- and early 20th-century American illustration, as well as works from the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The basis of the museum's collections are the works of Howard Pyle and his pupils N.C. Wyeth, Frank Schoonover, and Stanley Arthurs. Helen Farr Sloan was the wife of artist John French Sloan, and she began donations in 1961 that eventually totalled 5,000 objects. Since the 1970s, the museum has added works by modern artists such as Jacob Lawrence, Louise Nevelson, Robert Motherwell, George Segal, and Jim Dine. The permanent collections at the museum include the following: =Pre-Raphaelite Collection= Lady Lilith, completed 1873, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. *The Samuel and Mary R.

Two separate libraries opened in the new Delaware Art Center building in 1938: one centered on the collection of Howard Pyle, and the other centering on Samuel Bancroft, Jr. and his collections of Victorian books and books on Pre-Raphaelite painting. In 1978 Helen Farr Sloan donated the collections of her husband, the John Sloan Manuscript and Library Collection. A consolidated library opened in 1985 in the new Pamela and Lammot du Pont Copeland wing and was named in honor of Mrs. Sloan. It contains over 30,000 volumes and 1,000 boxes of personal papers, photographs and other material related to John Sloan, Samuel Bancroft, Jr. and Howard Pyle and his students.

He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to Scottish parents, one of six children of John H. and Mary Littleson McKellar. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of British Columbia, graduating in 1930. He began graduate studies at the University of California, being awarded his M.S. in 1932 and a Ph.D. the following year. Applying to the United States National Research Council, he was awarded a post-doctoral study program for two years at MIT. In 1935 he joined the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, where he performed research into astrophysics. He was married to Mary Crouch (b. June 3, 1911, d. Nov. 30, 2000) in 1938, and the couple bore two children, Andrew Robert William (Bob) (b. March 28, 1945), and Mary Barbara (b. Nov. 1, 1946) (McKellar) Bulman-Fleming. During World War II he served with the Royal Canadian Navy, in the Directorate of Operational Research. In 1940, McKellar made the first detection of molecular matter in the interstellar medium, identifying the spectrum of the organic compounds cyanogen (\\"CN\\") and methyne.Biography on astro-canada website (\\"CH\\"). The following year, his analysis of the spectra of the cyanogen molecules showed that the surrounding space was very cold with a temperature of approximately -271 ¬∞C. At the time, the significance of this was not appreciated; the distinguished Canadian chemist and future Nobel Laureate Gerhard Herzberg said that the temperature measurement \\"...has of course a very restricted meaning\\".Jodrell Bank website, University of Manchester Almost 25 years later Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson detected microwave radiation coming from all regions of the sky corresponding to the same temperature of -271 ¬∞C found by McKellar, thus revealing its ubiquity and relation to the radiation left over from the Big Bang. McKellar's early death, after a prolonged illness, in 1960 precluded him from consideration for the Nobel Prize awarded to Penzias and Wilson in 1978. Following the war, from 1952 until 1953, he was visiting professor at the University of Toronto department of physics. Between 1956 and 1958 he served as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, then in 1959 he became president of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada for a year. He continued working at the DAO up until four days before he died in Victoria, British Columbia from complications due to lymphoma contracted during his service in the Navy during the War. He was noted for his work in molecular spectroscopy. Among his contributions was the first estimation of the temperature of interstellar gas (and therefore deep space) as 2.4¬∞ K based on the excitation of CN doublet lines, and finding evidence for the carbon-nitrogen nuclear cycle as the energy source for carbon stars. (The temperature estimate was subsequently confirmed with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which has a measured temperature of 2.725 ¬∞K.) During his career he was the author (or co-author) of 73 scientific publications.

For over fifty years, Helen Farr Sloan quietly created a remarkable profile as an American philanthropist. Following the 1951 death of her husband, John Sloan, one of the most famous American artists of the twentieth century, Helen organized the artist‚Äôs estate and turned it into an philanthropic instrument to serve local, regional, national, and international arts constituencies.Delaware Art Museum - A Singular Friend: Helen Farr Sloan She was particularly known for her support for women entering the fields of art history and museum studies. Biography Farr was born in New York City. She was the daughter of Dr. Charles Farr, a New York surgeon, and Helen Woodhull Farr. She graduated high school from the prestigious Brearley School for girls in 1929. Her parents wanted her to attend Bryn Mawr College, but she knew that her interests lay in the arts and a less structured future. She took anatomy classes at Cornell University Medical College and studied weaving, pottery, metalwork, wood carving and jewelry making at the Craft Students League. At sixteen, Helen Farr enrolled in the Art Students League of New York, where she met and studied with John Sloan (1871‚Äì1951), who became her lifelong friend and mentor. In the 1930s Helen spent several summers in New Mexico with the Sloans, where she was an active member of the Santa Fe art colony. She was married in 1937 for a brief time to Wyatt Davis, brother of the abstract artist Stuart Davis. In 1944, while Helen Farr was workings as head of the art department at the Nightingale-Bamford School in New York City, Sloan's first wife, Dolly, died, leaving him a widower at age 74.NY Times Death Notice Later that year, Helen's former teacher, called her and invited her to join him in Santa Fe. Farr arrived in Santa Fe in the summer of 1945. They spent the summer collaborating on a book project and just before Farr was set to return to New York Sloan proposed and they were married by a justice of the peace. While her marriage to Sloan lasted only seven years, from 1945 to his death in 1951, Helen Farr Sloan‚Äôs devotion to art was a lifelong commitment. After Sloan‚Äôs death, she helped to organize his well-received posthumous retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art and returned to her teaching career and to painting. She also spent her remaining years supporting research about her husband and American art history and working overseeing the distribution of his estate. The contents of his studio and his wide-ranging library became a treasure trove for philanthropic giving. The recipients of her largesse include the University of Delaware, Sewell C. Biggs Museum in Dover, Delaware, Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art, Boston Film and Video Foundation, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Katonah Museum of Art in New York and the New-York Historical Society. Helen Farr Sloan‚Äôs own paintings are held in private and public collections, including the Delaware Art Museum and the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. Beginning in 1961, and continuing throughout her life, Helen Farr Sloan nurtured a special relationship with the Delaware Art Museum. Because of Helen Farr Sloan‚Äôs gifts and scholarship, the Delaware Art Museum received more than 5,000 works including the preeminent collection of the work of John Sloan with virtually every aspect of his career represented. This has made the Delaware Art Museum the leading repository for the study of John Sloan, who was noted for his realistic images of turn-of-the-century New York City. In the early 1960s, she also taught art part-time at Regis High School in Manhattan.Andreassi, Anthony D. (2014). Teach Me to Be Generous: The First Century of Regis High School in New York City.

An exhibit depicting Huna at the Beit Hatefutsot Rav Huna (Hebrew: ◊®◊ë ◊î◊ï◊†◊ê) was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in Babylonia, known as an amora of the second generation and head of the Academy of Sura; he was born about 216 (212 according to Gratz) and died in 296-297 (608 of the Seleucidan era)Sherira Gaon, in Neubauer, \\"M. J. C.\\" i. 30 or in 290.According to Abraham ibn Daud, \\"Sefer ha-Kabbalah\\" (in Neubauer, l.c. p. 58) Biography He lived in a town,Ta'anit 21b identified by Wiesener\\"Scholien zum Babylonischen Talmud,\\" ii. 193 with Tekrit.but read by Gr√§tz (= \\"Diokart\\") He was the principal pupil of Rav, under whom he acquired so much learning that one of Rava's three wishes was to possess Rav Huna's wisdom.Mo'ed Katan 28a He was also styled \\"one of the Babylonian Hasidim,\\" on account of his great piety.Ta'anit 23b The esteem in which he was held was so great that, though not of a priestly family, he read from the Torah on Shabbat and holy days the first passage, which is usually read by a Kohen (priest). Rav Ammi and Rav Assi, honored Israeli Kohanim, considered Huna as their superior.Megillah 22a; Gittin 59b Although Rav Huna was related to the family of the exilarchSherira Gaon, l.c. he was so poor at the beginning of his career that in order to buy wine to consecrate the Shabbat he had to pawn his girdle.Megillah 27b But Rav blessed him with riches, and Rav Huna displayed great wealth at the wedding of his son Raba bar Rav Huna.ib. He owned numerous flocks of sheep, which were under the special care of his wife, Hobah,Bava Kamma 80a and he traveled in a gilded litter.Ta'anit 20b Rav Huna was very generous. When the houses of the poor people were thrown down by storms he rebuilt them; at meal-times the doors of his house would be left open, while his servants would call out: \\"He who is hungry, let him come and eat\\".ib. After Rav's death, Huna lectured in his stead in the Academy of Sura, but he was not appointed head until after the death of Rav's companion, Samuel (c. 256). It was under Rav Huna that the Academy of Sura, which until then was called sidra, acquired the designation of mesivta (yeshivah), with Rav Huna being the first \\"Resh Mesivta\\" (rosh yeshivah).Compare Zacuto \\"Yuchasin,\\" p. 118b, K√∂nigsberg, 1857; and see Talmudic Academies in Babylonia Under Huna the academy increased considerably in importance, and students flocked to it from all directions; during his presidency their number reached 800, all supported by himself.Ketuvot 106a Their instant lecturers (\\"amora'e\\") were occupied in teaching them. When his pupils, after the lesson, shook their garments they raised so great a cloud of dust that when the Palestinian sky was overcast it was said, \\"Huna's pupils in Babylon have risen from their lesson\\".ib. Under Rav Huna, Palestine lost its ascendency over Babylonia; and on certain occasions he declared the schools of the two countries to be equal.Gittin 6a; Bava Kamma 80a In Babylonia, during his lifetime, the Sura academy held the supremacy. He presided over it for forty years, when he died suddenly, more than eighty years of age. His remains were brought to Israel and buried by the side of Hiyya the Great.Moed Kattan 25a Rav Huna's principal pupil was Rav Chisda, who had previously been his companion under Rav. Other pupils of his whose names are given were: Abba bar Zavda, Rav Giddel, R. Helbo, R. Sheshet, and Huna's own son, Rabbah.Yevamot 64b =Character traits= Rav Huna was known to be very tolerant as well as very modest. He was not ashamed, before he was rich, to cultivate his field himself, nor to return home in the evening with his spade on his shoulder.Megillah 28a When two contending parties requested him to judge between them, he said to them: \\"Give me a man to cultivate my field and I will be your judge\\".Ketuvot 105a He patiently bore Rav's hard words, because the latter was his teacher,Eruvin 15a; Yerushalmi Eruvin 1 3 but he showed on several occasions that a scholar must not humiliate himself in presence of an inferior.Ketuvot 69a; Bava Metzia 33a Teachings =Halacha= He transmitted many of Rav's halakhot, sometimes without mentioning Rav's name.Shabbat 24a et al. His own halakhot are numerous in the Babylonian Talmud, and although some of his decisions were contrary to Rav's,Shabbat 21a, b, 128a he declared Rav to be the supreme authority in religious law.Niddah 24b Rav Huna's deductions were sometimes casuistical; he interpreted the text verbatim even where the context seems to prohibit such an interpretation.Shabbat 20a; Men. 36a; et al. According to Rav Huna, the halakhah transmitted in the Mishnah and Baraita is not always to be taken as decisive.Berachot 24b, 59b He had some knowledge of medicine and natural history, and used his knowledge in many of his halakhic decisions.Shabbat 20a, 54b; Yevamot 75b He also interpreted many of the difficult words met with in the Mishnah and Baraita.Shabbat 53b, 54b, et al. =Aggadah= Rav Huna was equally distinguished as an aggadist, and his aggadot were known in the Land of Israel, to where they were carried by some of his pupils, Rav Zeira among them. His interpretation of Proverbs 14:23, transmitted by Rav Zeira, is styled \\"the pearl\\".Pesikta 2 13b; compare Yerushalmi Shabbat 7:2, where also many halakhot of his are preserved, transmitted by Rav Zeira Many of his aggadot, showing his skill in Biblical exegesis, are found in the Babylonian Talmud, some in the name of Rav, some in his own. He took special pains to reconcile apparently conflicting passages, as, for instance, II Samuel 7:10 and I Chronicles 17:10.Berachot 7b He attempted to solve the problem of theodicy, inferring from Isaiah 53:10 that God chastens those whom He loves.Berachot 5a =Quotes= * \\"He who occupies himself with the study of the Law alone is as one who has no God\\".Inferred from II Chronicles 15:3; Avodah Zarah 17b * \\"When leaving the synagogue, one must not take long steps\\".Berachot 6b * \\"He who recites his prayer behind the synagogue is called impious or rasha.Inferred from Psalms 12:9 [A.

Storylines Sadie first appeared in late November 1998 as Pamela Tripp's gossipy and flamboyant mother, a former stage actor. Sadie then took a job working for the villainous Pete Callan serving behind the bar at bar/restaurant The Lock, and became one of Pete's few friends. She refused to believe that her daughter Pamela was being stalked by a former client, but after Pamela killed him in self-defence, assisted her daughter in disposing of the body and keeping the incident secret. After the body was found in 1999 Pamela accepted full responsibility for the crime, and Sadie was not charged. Pamela went to prison begging Sadie to forget about her and to never visit her in prison. Sadie apparently followed this instruction, and Pamela was rarely mentioned for several years. Sadie followed Pete to continue working for him at his new pub The Black Swan in 2000. During her time on Stanley Street, Sadie began opening her home to various lodgers. In 2001, her sister, Gloria along with her husband Barry and their daughter Kelly came over for a visit from Australia. When Barry and Gloria returned to Australia, Kelly stayed in Charnham with Sadie for a year. Kelly died on New Year's Eve 2002, after falling down the stairs after an argument with Matt Ellis, the father of Kelly's daughter Grace (Kelly had agreed to be a surrogate mother for Matt and his wife Karen Ellis and had had an affair with Karen). Sadie was left devastated. In late 2003, Sadie took a job at Dusty's Stores, in addition to her job at the pub and quickly made friends with Myra Costello, whose family had recently arrived in the area. In early 2004, Sadie began seeing Jeff Lloyd. Though embarrassed by his social gaffes she enjoyed his generosity with money, especially since she was facing financial ruin having run up large credit cards debts while defaulting on her home mortgage repayments. Learning that Jeff was dying, Sadie agreed to marry him, seeing it as a way out of her financial predicament, and she became Sadie Lloyd. Jeff died soon after the wedding, however his estranged daughter contested the will and Sadie got nothing, and was forced to put her home on the market. Number 6 was purchased by her friends and lodgers Doug and Cat MacKenzie. By mid-2005, Sadie's health was rapidly on the decline following a stroke. Pam returned to Charnham after being tracked down by Pete. Pam was revealed to be living in Birmingham, having been paroled a year earlier, working as a maid. Pam and Sadie had a difficult time reconnecting when they returned, even though Sadie was understanding about Pam having come out as a lesbian. In the end, things became so strained, Pam decided to return to Birmingham with Teresa and Sadie went into Sheltered housing outside of London. When Pete died after a shootout with SO19 Officers in September 2005, Cat phoned Sadie to inform her of his death. On the day of Pete's funeral, Cat revealed that Sadie had mentioned she wasn't up to making the journey to Charnham. This was the last that was heard of Sadie. Reception A reporter from Soaplife said \\"comic turn of the month\\" for November 1999. The referenced storyline involved Sadie performing at a talent contest but being mistaken for a drag queen.

It was first published in the Spring 1942 issue of Planet Stories and reprinted in the collection The Early Asimov (1972). \\"Black Friar of the Flame\\" was the thirteenth story written by Asimov, and was among his least favorite, though this was due more to the multiple rewrites and rejections the story suffered than to its admittedly modest intrinsic merits. Writing and re-writing Asimov began work on the story, which he originally titled \\"Pilgrimage\\", on 4 March 1939. It was to be \\"future history\\", set in the far future but written as though it were a historical novel, and would take place on a galactic scale. Asimov finished the 12,600-word story and submitted it to John W. Campbell on 21 March. Three days later, Asimov got the story back with a rejection slip that said, \\"You have a basic idea that might be made into an interesting yarn, but as it is, it is not strong enough.\\" Asimov was not discouraged; he had succeeded in revising his earlier story \\"Trends\\" to Campbell's satisfaction, and decided he could do the same with \\"Pilgrimage\\". He brought a slightly longer revised version to Campbell on 25 April, and although Campbell wouldn't take it, he did ask for a second revision. Asimov submitted the second revision on May 9, only to have the story returned again. Campbell thought the story could still be salvaged, but he suggested that Asimov set it aside for several months and then return to it. Asimov started his third revision of \\"Pilgrimage\\" on 1 August and finished it in a week; by now the story had increased to 18,000 words. Asimov submitted the third revision to Campbell on 8 August. Campbell was waiting for a short novel by Robert A. Heinlein called If This Goes On‚Äî which also involved religion and revolution; if Heinlein's story was better, he would reject \\"Pilgrimage\\". As it turned out, Heinlein's story was better, and Asimov got his story back on 6 September. When Asimov's friend and then-agent Frederik Pohl became editor of Astonishing Stories and Super Science Stories later that year, Asimov submitted \\"Pilgrimage\\" to him. Pohl also rejected it, saying the ending was weak. Asimov continued trying to sell \\"Pilgrimage\\", rewriting it twice more and changing the title to \\"Galactic Crusade\\". Finally, on 15 August 1941, Asimov learned that Planet Stories editor Malcolm Reiss was interested in the story. Following yet another rewrite, removing the religious dimension, Reiss accepted the story on 7 October 1941, running it in the Spring 1942 issue under the title \\"Black Friar of the Flame\\". Plot summary The story is set thousands of years in the future. The Lhasinu, a reptilian race native to Vega, rule a third of the galaxy, including Earth. The rest of the galaxy is occupied by a number of independent human planets which are content to maintain the status quo. Earth is, however, the center of a cult called Loarism, whose adherents make an annual pilgrimage there. The Loarists are content to allow the Lhasinu to rule Earth as long as their own cult is not interfered with. When the people of Earth rose up against the Lhasinu five hundred years earlier, the Loarists did not aid them, and the rebellion was crushed. The story opens with Russell Tymball, a nationalist Earthman, gaining possession of a Lhasinuic dispatch ordering the evacuation of Earth's human population and the planet's destruction. This will deal a death-blow to Loarism, and set the stage for the Second Galactic Drive, a planned Lhasinuic offensive against the disunited human worlds of the galaxy. Tymball uses the dispatch to convince Loara Paul Kane, head of the Loarists, to join in a second Terran rebellion against the Lhasinu. When a young Loarist pilgrim named Filip Sanat discovers two Lhasinu skulking around the Memorial in New York, Earth's most sacred structure, discussing the upcoming destruction of Earth, he rushes out, rouses a crowd, and starts a riot. When the Lhasinu attempt to force their way into the Memorial to arrest Sanat, they are overcome by Tymball's rebels and a human mob. Within a day, the Lhasinu are driven from New York City, and Sanat is sent out of the Solar System to enlist the help of the other human worlds. Six months later, the Lhasinu are closing in on Earth, while the fleets of several human worlds close in on the Lhasinu. The human alliance is close to breaking up when Sanat betrays Lunar Base to the Lhasinu, forcing the allied human fleets to fight in self-defense. The Lhasinu fleet attacking Earth is defeated. At the same time, a human fleet attacking the Lhasinuic Home Fleet in the Vega system is also victorious, and the Lhasinu are forced to surrender. Reputation \\"Black Friar of the Flame\\" has a reputation as Asimov's worst story, based partly on what he described as an \\"awful\\" title. However, it serves as a precursor to Asimov's more successful venture into future history, the Foundation Series. The planets Trantor and Santanni make their first appearance in \\"Black Friar of the Flame\\". The general situation of an embattled Earth facing a vast empire is similar to that of Pebble in the Sky, which like \\"Black Friar of the Flame\\" was based on the conflict between Judea and the Roman Empire. Another historical reference is the modelling of the climactic battle on the Battle of Salamis. The multiple rewrites the story went through turned Asimov off rewrites. Most of Asimov's subsequent stories were published as he wrote them, or after a single revision. After its initial publication in Planet Stories, \\"Black Friar of the Flame\\" was reprinted in a 1952 magazine published by Planet Stories called Tops in Science Fiction.

Melanie returned in December 2005 for the final week of the series. Arrival Melanie first arrived in Charnham in September 2003, along with her parents Gary, Chrissy and her 8-year-old sister, Chloe. Gary had recently lost his job and the family were forced to move from a mansion in Chigwell into Number 12 Stanley street which had recently been vacated by Jim Webb, his sister Karen, Karen's husband Matt and their daughter, Grace. Mel struggled to adjust to life in Charnham. Her Boyfriend, Bradley Foster had gone travelling to Australia and Melanie was finding it difficult to get work. Melanie tried the local pub, The Black Swan, but was rejected after her new friend Lucy Day mentioned to the landlord, Pete Callan that Melanie was underage. Melanie eventually managed to land a job working for Roy Farmer at the cybercafe. Trouble with Drugs Mel had a brief experimentation with drugs and offered her new friend Lewis Davenport some pills. Lewis had an adverse reaction and collapsed. Lewis assured Mel that he took the pills of his own accord. Further problems arose, when Chloe, Mel's younger sister discovered the pills in her and took one causing her to fall into a coma. Luckily, Chloe recovered. Gary was forgiving, but Chrissy was still angry. Eventually Chrissy forgave Mel, but the Costellos' problems were far from over... Relationship with Brendan Boulter At the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004, Mel began dating Brendan Boulter, her friend Kelly's brother. During a dinner at the Costellos, Chrissy talked non-stop about Mel's previous boyfriend Bradley. Chrissy had made it abundantly clear that she wasn't happy with Mel dating Brendan, who she hardly knew. Despite this, Mel continued seeing Brendan, unaware that he was living a double life. Accessory to Deception After suspicions from Pete Callan's wife Eileen, which were later confirmed by local nurse Tanya Woods, Chrissy had been exposed for lying about Chloe having cancer and was arrested. Melanie was later held in custody after taking ¬£500 from Chloe's account for Lewis (to feed his drug addiction). Melanie was later forced to pay back the money. Brendan's revelation At Brendan and Melanie's engagement party which, was held at the Boulters' place, Brendan told the truth about him being bisexual and Mel promptly called the engagement off after outing him. After much coaxing, Mel decided to go to New York City with Brendan, who had originally bought the tickets as an engagement present. Surprise Marriage On their return, Mel and Brendan surprised their families by announcing they had gotten married while in New York. Chrissy was against the idea and wanted the marriage annulled but Gary talked her out of it. Mel and Brendan were happy living at Number 16 along with Brendan's family, for the time being. Marital Break up In November 2004, On the day of the christening of Brendan's niece Suzie, Melanie found out that Brendan had lied to her once again about Jason, a man who identified himself as Brendan's boyfriend. Melanie decided to end it once and for all. Graham Harker and Exit In March 2005, Melanie began dating Graham Harker, much to the chagrin of her in-laws, The Boulter Family. Denise identified Graham as her rapist. Melanie refused to believe this claim and stood by Graham until one day Graham lost his temper and hit her. It wasn't until Graham was arrested for kidnapping Denise, that Melanie began to realise the truth. Following Gary's acquittal of assaulting Bradley for molesting Chloe and her parents' remarriage; Melanie decided to leave Charnham leaving her family worried. Return In December 2005, Melanie returned home just before Christmas and was greeted with a less than warm reception from Chrissy. Eventually things thawed and Melanie was back in the family bosom.

NSTA's current membership of more than 57,000 includes science teachers, science supervisors, administrators, scientists, business and industry representatives, and others involved in and committed to science education. The Association publishes a professional journal for each level of science teaching; a newspaper, NSTA Reports; and many other educational books and professional publications. Each year NSTA conducts a national conference and a series of area conferences. These events attract over 30,000 attendees annually. The Association serves as an advocate for science educators by keeping its members and the general public informed about national issues and trends in science education.  History  NSTA was formed by the merger of two existing professional organizations, the American Science Teachers Association and the American Council of Science Teachers, at a July 1944 meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The organization was initially headquartered at Cornell University. This first permanent headquarters, purchased in 1972, was located on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C and then moved to Arlington, Virginia in 1994. Position statements NSTA is engaged in an ongoing effort to \\"identify the qualities and standards of good science education,\\" publishing its findings in the form of position statements. These position statements are developed by science educators, scientists, and other national experts in science education, and the input of NSTA's membership is solicited before final approval by the board of directors. Over 35 topics are covered, including The Nature of Science, Safety and Science Instruction, The Teaching of Evolution, Environmental education, Responsible Use of Live Animals and Dissection in the Science Classroom, Gender Equity in Science Education, and Use of the Metric System. In 2018, the NSTA urged teachers to \\"emphasize to students that no scientific controversy exists regarding the basic facts of climate change.\\" Science Matters Science Matters is a major public awareness and engagement campaign designed to rekindle a national sense of urgency and action among schools and families about the importance of science education and science literacy. Science Matters builds on the success of the Building a Presence for Science program, first launched in 1997 as an e-networking initiative to assist teachers of science with professional development opportunities.

Mudflat hikers are people who, with the aid of a tide table, use a period of low water to walk and wade on the watershed of the mudflats, especially from the Frisian mainland coast to the Frisian islands. The Wadden Sea, a belt of the North Sea, is well suited to this traditional practice. Belts of this shallow sea lie off the mainland of the Netherlands, between Friesland and the Frisian Islands; off the coast of northwestern Germany; and off the coast of southwest Jutland in Denmark. In the Netherlands, mudflat hikers can walk from the mainland to Terschelling, Ameland, Engelsmanplaat, Schiermonnikoog, Simonszand, and Rottumeroog. Other mudflat hiking routes are known but are not recommended, either because of their inherent dangers (the correct path is difficult to follow and/or there are insufficient margins of error in timing the trip) or for the minimization of ecological disturbance, or both. In Germany, mudflat hikers can walk to the East Frisian Islands of Norderney, Baltrum, Langeoog, Spiekeroog, Minsener-Oldoog and Neuwerk. The North Frisian Halligen S√ºderoog, S√ºdfall, Oland, Langene√ü, Gr√∂de, and Nordstrandischmoor as well as the island F√∂hr can also be reached from the mainland. There is also a connection between the islands Amrum and F√∂hr. For this specific route, a guide is mandatory. In Denmark, mudflat hikers can walk to Mand√∏, Fan√∏, and Langli. The same activity is occasionally practiced in England, most commonly making use of abandoned sub-tidal carriage roads once used by horse-drawn traffic. The best-known example is the crossing of Morecambe Bay, where guided walks along the 11km route are led by the current holder of the ancient office of Queen's Guide to the Sands. Another is The Broomway in Essex. Both routes pose severe potential dangers and walkers are usually led by experienced guides. Regulation Mudflat waders In Dutch waters, mudflat hiking is only allowed with an appropriate license or under the supervision of a licensed guide, and only on recognized routes. In the Netherlands, Dijkstra's Wadlooptochten Pieterburen, Wadloopcentrum Frysl√¢n in Holwerd, Wadloopcentrum Pieterburen Pieterburen, Stichting Uithuizerwad Uithuizen, Wadloopvereniging Arenicola Groningen, Wadgidsengroep Noord Nederland, and the Fryske Waedrinners are organisations for the training of mudflat hiking guides and the preservation of the sport. Though the tides change in very regular cycles, anyone can easily misjudge the situation and find themselves quickly surrounded by the rising water on all sides, far away from the beaches. A guide should be hired to prevent any mishaps.

The Tui Sports was a small single seat aerobatic single bay biplane of fabric covered wooden construction with a highly streamlined circular section fuselage. It was powered by a Szekely 3 cylinder engine. The Tui Sports was built by Fred North at Dannevirke and first flown by Allan McGruer from a field near Whenuapai on 4 January 1934. It was named after the highly maneuverable Tui bird. The silver and gold Tui became very popular, being used for aero club flying and airline pilot training. Originally intended as a one off homebuilt, its success encouraged Fred North and the Dominion Aircraft Company to prepare for production in Auckland, however New Zealand's declaration of war against Germany on 3 September 1939 resulted in these plans being postponed and latter scrapped.

The 1937 Constitution of Ireland established the office of President of Ireland, whose holder should \\"take precedence over all other persons in the State\\".

Born in New York City, he made a career of spy trading, international hostage mediation, and other forms of high-stakes, high-intrigue diplomacy. He served as presidential liaison of President Richard Nixon to the Jewish community during the Nixon administration. He served as a community activist, chaired various civic boards, directed a high school and a summer camp, and was the chairman of Magenu. Background and early life Ronald Greenwald was born to European Jewish immigrant parents and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan before his family relocated to Brownsville (in Brooklyn). He studied at Telshe Yeshiva in Cleveland after high school. After getting married, he settled in Boro Park in Brooklyn. In the early years of his marriage, he worked as a teacher of both Judaic and secular studies in Brooklyn yeshivas.Zman Magazine October 2015 issue, page 344 Rabbi Greenwald became active in politics in 1962 (at the age of 28) lobbying on behalf of Torah Umesorah to promote the creation and success of Jewish day schools in the United States. At the request of Jewish activist George Klein, Rabbi Greenwald became involved in the gubernatorial campaign of Nelson A. Rockefeller and helped Rockefeller win an unprecedented share of the Jewish vote for a Republican at the time. After this success, the Rockefeller campaign recommended Greenwald to the campaign of Richard M. Nixon and the Nixon re-election campaign appointed Greenwald to work for the President's 1972 re-election in the Jewish community. In winning 35% of the Jewish vote in 1972, Nixon, like Rockefeller, did far better among Jewish voters than would be expected from a Republican in that era.Zman Magazine October 2015 issue, page 308-309 During the Nixon administration, Rabbi Greenwald served as liaison between the administration and the Jewish community in a variety of ways. He obtained a $1 million grant to open a legal aid office in Brooklyn to assist the needy in the community of Williamsburg among other accomplishments. During the Watergate scandal, Rabbi Greenwald contacted various Democratic Jewish members of Congress, including Elizabeth Holtzman, Bella Abzug and Arlen Specter to try to convince them that impeaching the President would weaken the United States and, by extension, hurt Israel, which, in the wake of the Yom Kippur War needed the support of a strong United States. Although his entreaties did not work, as President Nixon was eventually forced to resign rather than face impeachment, he did earn a Presidential letter of thanks (see the letter at the bottom of this article).Zman Magazine October 2015 issue, page 310-311 He died in his sleep while on vacation in Florida, on January 20, 2016.http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/331196/rabbi-ronald-greenwald- former-nixon-jewish-community-liaison-dies-at-82/ Involvement in notable release efforts Greenwald was involved in scores of release efforts for various prisoners from around the world. =Natan Sharansky= Rabbi Greenwald taking to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, with whom he worked closely in a series of hostage release efforts, including the Sharansky case In perhaps his highest profile case, Rabbi Greenwald worked closely with Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY) and East German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel to secure the release of Soviet dissident and Refusenik Natan Sharansky from Soviet prison in the late 1970s. He made more than 25 trips across the \\"Iron Curtain\\" to East Germany as part of that effort.New York Post article from June 16, 1978 The Rockland Journal News reported that Rabbi Greenwald was the \\"man behind the talks\\" that freed Sharansky.Rockland Journal News, February 11, 1986, front page (banner headline) =Miron Markus= In conjunction with Representative Gilman, Rabbi Greenwald negotiated the rescue a 24-year-old Israeli citizen named Miron Markus in 1978 who was living in Zimbabwe. Markus was captured when an airplane piloted by his brother-in-law, Jackie Bloch, was forced to land in Mozambique, where Mr. Bloch was killed and Markus taken hostage. Rabbi Greenwald, Congressman Gilman and others arranged for a complex swap that involved four countries Mozambique, Israel, the UnS and East Germany, convicted East German spy Robert Thompson and U.S. student Alan van Norman. =Raul Granados= Granados was kidnapped by leftist guerillas in November, 1979 while at a soccer game in Guatemala City. Rabbi Greenwald, working again with Representative Gilman, helped broker the exchange of Mr. Granados in exchange for a ransom payment of $4,000,000.New York Post article from January 21, 1980 =Vladimir Raiz= Vladimir Raiz, a Soviet molecular biologist, had been denied permission to leave the former Soviet Union for 18 years before Greenwald entered the picture. According to Steve Lieberman in the Rockland Journal News, Greenwald secretly met with Raiz in Lithuania in 1989. Following negotiations with Soviet authorities, Raiz and his family were permitted to emigrate in 1990.Rockland Journal News article from March 9, 1990 =Shabattai Kalmanovich= Greenwald was involved in the transfer of Shabattai Kalmanovich from the USSR to Israel. However, in 1987 Kalmanovitch was arrested in Tel Aviv and charged with being a KGB spy and sentenced to nine years in prison in 1987 for spying for the Soviet Union. He was released from prison after five years and returned to Russia. On November 2, 2009, Kalamovitch was assassinated in Moscow. =Lori Berenson= Rabbi Greenwald in Peru, working on the Berenson case In 1994, political activist and New York native Lori Berenson was arrested, tried and sentenced to life imprisonment for treason by a Peruvian military tribunal. She was accused of belonging to a Marxist rebel group and plotting to overthrow the Peruvian government.The Wall Street Journal Online - Citizen of the World Because of the shady circumstances surrounding her trial and her harsh sentence, Amnesty International, in 2003, referred to Berenson as a \\"political prisoner.\\"Amnesty International With the support of President Bill Clinton in 2000, Greenwald led a delegation of American negotiators to Peru to press the Peruvian government to free Berenson or, at least, to grant her a new trial in a civilian court.The Jewish Week, March 10, 2000 The effort succeeded and Berenson was afforded a new trial in civilian court. At her subsequent trial, Berenson was convicted again and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. =Jonathan Pollard= Greenwald was involved in many of the attempts to gain clemency for Jonathan Pollard by convincing the then serving President of the United States to pardon Pollard or to commute his sentence. Particularly noteworthy was his effort to set up a three way trade involving Israel, the US and Russia. Under Greenwald's proposal, Israel would release Professor Marcus Klingberg, who was being held by Israel or suspected Russian spy Shabattai Kalmanovich to Russia, the Russians would release Dmitri Polyakov (known to the FBI as \\"Top Hat\\") or Anatoly Filatov, who were both being held by Russia on suspicion of having spied for the United States, and the U.S. would pardon Pollard and allow him to move to Israel. Congressman Benjamin Gilman and Sam Nunn's former chief of staff, Jeff Smith (who would later become chief council for the CIA), were also involved in the proposed transaction. Unfortunately for Pollard, the effort broke down when Yossi Ben Aharon, assistant to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir insisted on Israel negotiating directly with the Russians rather than through an intermediary such as Greenwald. The Israeli negotiating effort never gained traction, and Pollard remained in prison until 2015. Greenwald's and others' efforts to convince U.S. President Bill Clinton to commute Pollard's sentence were hampered in large part by a letter written to Clinton by Donald Rumsfeld and signed by seven former Secretaries of Defense, urging the President not to pardon Pollard. (See letter on right.) =Alfred Zehe= In 1983, Dr. Alfred Zehe, an East German scientist attending a conference in Massachusetts, was arrested for conspiracy to violate U.S. espionage laws for allegedly handing secret \\"sonar plan\\" documents to East German operatives in Mexico. East German lawyer and spy trader Wolfgang Vogel was put in charge of the effort to free Zehe. He brought in Alan Dershowitz to oversee the legalities of the effort and Greenwald to act as a person liaison between him and Zehe. Greenwald visited Zehe several times in prison. During this time, he learned that Zehe was being threatened with being brought to trial under espionage charges that carried the threat of many decades in prison while being cajoled to turn over to the CIA whatever information he had that might be helpful to that agency. Greenwald conveyed messages to Zehe from his family urging him to do whatever it took to allow himself to be released as soon as possible. Eventually, Zehe pleaded guilty and conducted a full debriefing in exchange for the promise of a light sentence. He was released as part an exchange of agents in June 1985. Speaking career Rabbi Greenwald was a featured speaker at many conventions and gatherings throughout his career. Recently, he spoke at the Agudath Israel of America Convention. He also spoke at the Aish Partners Conference. Media coverage Jack Anderson, in the December 3, 1988, edition of the Washington Post, reported that Rabbi Greenwald was working on an effort to persuade U.S. authorities to release convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, who had been condemned to life imprisonment. Those efforts were unsuccessful, and Pollard remained in prison until his parole in 2015. With regard to Pollard, Greenwald has commented \\"With the Pollard case there's not exactly anti-Semitism, but rather the issue of Israel and how the State Department looks at Jews and feels about Israel, and I believe there's a bias.\\"Jewish News, Jewish Newspapers - Forward.com Earlier, Anderson had insinuated in a previous column that Rabbi Greenwald had ties to the CIA, Mossad and KGB.Washington Post November 18, 1986, Page E19 Ronald Greenwald meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti regarding an upcoming trip to Libya to meet Libyan President Muammar al-Gaddafi On February 3, 1986, the ABC Evening News with Peter Jennings credited Greenwald with playing a role in the negotiations for the release of Sharansky and featured a video clip of Rabbi Greenwald expressing optimism that Sharansky would be released.USSR / Shcharansky ABC News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive His high-placed connections and adventures involving delicate international diplomacy have led to speculation (albeit groundless) about nefarious connections to legal and illegal organizations around the world. As of May 2006, no fewer than 20 websites (mostly anti-Semitic sites) have alleged that Rabbi Greenwald has or had mafia connections. On March 9, 1990, a Rockland Journal News headline called Greenwald a \\"master of international negotiation\\" and credited him with playing prominent roles in the freeing of Sharansky, Marcus, Granados and several others. The USA Today also credited Greenwald for arranging the release of Sharansky and commented that his dealings with famed international mediators such as Wolfgang Vogel during various negotiations resembled a \\"spy novel.\\"USA Today, February 12, 1986, Page 2A =Television interviews regarding the New Square Pardon Affair= Following the pardon by President Bill Clinton of several convicted members of the New Square Hassidic community, Greenwald was interviewed by several media outlets regarding his opinion and even his role in the affair. The fact that Greenwald had ties to the New Square community, was a former business associate of Marc Rich, another person pardoned by Clinton at the end of his term and had been questioned by the FBI during its investigation into the pardons, made his opinions regarding the incident highly sought after by media outlets. On March 12, 2001, on The Edge, Paula Zahn conducted a 10-minute interview with Greenwald. He also appeared on The O'Reilly Factor on October 10, 2002, when he was cross examined by host Bill O'Reilly for several minutes regarding the affair. In both interviews, Greenwald conceded that the New Square community probably voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in her race against Rick Lazio for U.S. Senate in 2000 with some expectation that some consideration be given to pardoning the members of the New Square community. However, he steadfastly maintained that there had been no quid pro quo or agreement to exchange votes for a pardon. Lithuanian Torah Scrolls Incident Ronald Greenwald meeting with the President of Lithuania, Algirdas Brazouskas Rabbi Greenwald and others participating in the \\"funeral\\" of destroyed Torah scrolls in Lithuania In September 1997, during a visit of scores of rabbis and other Orthodox Jews to Lithuania to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the death of the great Vilna Gaon (Rabbi Eliyahu Kramer of Vilnius),\\"Back to the Future,\\" Jewish Seintinel, October 10‚Äì16, 1997, Page 17 Rabbi Greenwald personally successfully negotiated with the Lithuanian government to allow the burial of several desecrated Torah scrolls. The scrolls were among hundreds of Torah scrolls that had been disgraced by the Nazis and/or the Lithuanians during World War II. With the negotiated help of the government, Greenwald and others located over three hundred scrolls, including some that were being held in the basement of a church. They were able to salvage most of the scrolls for further use. The scrolls that could not be salvaged were buried in an elaborate ceremony attended by visiting Orthodox Jews from around the World and Lithuanian officials.\\"Burial of Holocaust Torah Remnants in Vilna,\\" Jewish Press, October 3, 1997 The day prior to the \\"funeral,\\" Rabbi Greenwald was invited to (and did) address the Lithuanian Parliament. During the same visit, Greenwald intervened with the Prime Minister to prevent the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Vilnius. The Lithuanian government was going to raze the cemetery and erect a shopping mall on the site. Rabbi Greenwald contacted the Prime Minister's office and promised the Prime Minister that saving the cemetery would bring him great blessing. As Greenwald had previously interceded on Lithuania's behalf as it sought to enter NATO, his words carried strong influence with the Prime Minister and his request was heeded.Mishpacha Magazine for December 17, 2014, page 53 Yitti Leibel Help Line tribute Cover page of the Yitti Liebel Helpline 2009 Luncheon Journal Journal ad honoring Rabbi Greenwald On November 15, 2009, The Yitti Liebel Help Line honored Greenwald by dedicating the event and the journal as a tribute to him. The journal cover page referred to him as a \\"champion of chessed\\" and as a \\"living, one man Chessed organization.\\" The journal credited him with saving Jews from eastern Europe and Africa and proclaimed that \\"thousands of people owe more than they can ever repay to one hero- Ronnie!\\" Mishpacha Magazine feature Mishpacha Magazine, an Orthodox Jewish weekly magazine featured Greenwald for its cover story on May 13, 2009.http://www.mishpacha.com/backissuesLarge/1/258/ The magazine referred to Greenwald as a \\"legend among lifesavers\\" and the inside contained a 12-page feature article detailing Greenwald's exploits on behalf of people in distress around the globe over the course of many decades. Other activities =Bophuthatswana= Rabbi Greenwald had a variety of unusual ties to South Africa in the Apartheid era. He was the diplomatic representative of the African Bantustan of Bophuthatswana in the United States, when that \\"homeland\\" lacked international recognition. =Schools and camps= When not engaged in high-stakes international diplomacy, Greenwald operated Camp Sternberg, a summer camp in the Catskill MountainsCamp Sternberg & Anna Heller and ran Monsey Academy for Girls, a private high school in Rockland County, New York, of which he was the founder.Neve Yerushalayim Jewish Educational Network =Involvement with charitable organizations= Greenwald served as chairman of the board of the Women's League in Rockland County (which creates and oversees adult group homes in that county) and of the Borough Park, Brooklyn branch of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services (JBFCS). He also serves on the Board of Governors of the Orthodox Union, and as acting chairman of Magenu.Contact and Feedback =Rabbi Greenwald and the Prince of Italy= Rabbi Greenwald with Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoia Greenwald worked with Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Italy in a variety of capacities. In January 2007, the two met in New York to discuss, among other things, a billion dollar Las Vegas hotel construction project being worked on by the \\"Made in Italy Group.\\" (Both men serve the project in various capacities.) During the meeting, Prince Filiberto expressed regret for his great-grandfather Victor Emmanuel III's cooperation (albeit limited) with Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in their campaign of aggressive war and genocide against the Jews. He further reiterated his prior condemnation of those actions and expressed optimism regarding the present and future of Italian-Jewish relations.Jewish Tribune, January 19‚Äì25, 2007, pages 3,39 Other positions Greenwald served as Chairman of the Board of the Women's League, once led by Rebetzin Perlow, the wife of Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, the Novominsker Rebbe.Yated Ne'eman Page 144 from December 5, 2014 Rabbi Greenwald has also held positions as: *Executive Director of Yeshiva Toras Emes in Brooklyn, New York *Director of the Jewish election campaign of former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller *Chaplain of the New York State Police *Director of the Jewish presidential campaign of Richard Nixon References Letter from U.S. President Richard Nixon to Greenwald.

Character information Gary first arrived in Charnham in September 2003, after purchasing Number 12 Stanley Street from Jim Webb and his family who had recently moved to Spain. Gary had lost his job in Chigwell and was forced to move his wife Chrissy, and their daughters Melanie and Chloe to Charnham. A short while later, Gary's mother Myra, moved over from Spain to live with the family. Gary later went into partnership with Dave Matthews and together they set up a business called Gaz n' Dave's, a minicab firm. Later that year, Chrissy had taken Chloe to the doctors and had told Gary that Chloe had been diagnosed with cancer. This later turned out to be a lie, resulting in the subsequent arrest of Chrissy. Chrissy had duped the local residents into starting a collection for Chloe. It transpired that Chrissy had suffered from mental illness after losing her sister, Helen as a child. Gary and Chrissy's marriage went through numerous problems and they separated for a while. In October 2004, Melanie's ex-boyfriend, Bradley Foster who had lodged with the Costellos for several months, had been accused of sexually abusing Chloe. This led to a fierce showdown on Bonfire Night when Gary wanted a confession and Bradley (who had moved next door to with his mother, Sharon Ingram and her boyfriend Conrad Williams) began goading Gary about how Chloe wouldn't leave him alone. Gary angrily shouted \\"She's only 10 years old!\\" and promptly punched Bradley, knocking him out. Gary was remanded in custody for assault and Bradley, upon receiving a retina operation was arraigned with him, as Bradley had been charged with possession of indecent images. Both were subsequently bailed, but a question mark hung over Gary's future. On Christmas Eve 2004, Gary proposed to Chrissy to remarry him and she accepted. Gary stood trial in Spring 2005 for the assault on Bradley and things weren't looking very good. The verdict was rendered and the jury found Gary not guilty. Shortly afterwards, Gary and Chrissy remarried. The Costellos had more dramas to worry about when Melanie ran away in May 2005 after a failed relationship with Graham Harker, who was revealed to be the rapist of Melanie's ex-mother- in-law, Denise Boulter. Gary began to struggle a little with the cab business once Dave left for Scotland.

Examples of demerit goods include tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, gambling, junk food and prostitution. Because of the nature of these goods, governments often levy taxes on these goods (specifically, sin taxes), in some cases regulating or banning consumption or advertisement of these goods. Concept There is an important conceptual distinction between a demerit good and a negative externality. A negative externality occurs when the consumption of a good has measurable negative consequences on others who do not consume the good themselves. Pollution (due, for example, to automobile use) is the canonical example of a negative externality. By contrast, a demerit good is viewed as undesirable because its consumption has negative effects upon the consumer for example cigarette.. Cigarettes have both properties ‚Äì they are a demerit good because they damage the smoker's own health, but they also produce the negative externality of damage to others via second-hand smoke. Two fundamental views in welfare economics, welfarism and paternalism, differ in their conceptual treatment of 'demerit goods'. Simply, welfarism takes the individual's own perception of the utility of a good as the final judgement of the utility of the good for that person, and thereby disallows the concept of a 'demerit good' (while allowing the analysis of negative externalities). As an extreme example, if a heroin addict purchases heroin, they must have done so because heroin makes them better off, and this transaction is viewed as a net social positive (assuming that the addict does not commit any other crimes as the result of their addiction). Paternalism, on the other hand, judges that heroin \\"isn't good for you\\", and feels free to override the judgement of the addicts themselves.

J. Burley. He featured in twenty-two novels. (Burley died when the twenty-third was still unfinished). Fictional biography D/Supt Wycliffe is the head of the CID (plainclothes detective branch of the police) in Devon and Cornwall. As such, he takes charge of all investigations of serious crime. Although Wycliffe is not a native Cornishman (his family were market gardeners in Shropshire) and he is advised that the outlook and attitudes of people in some of Cornwall's more remote communities is not what he may be used to, he tries hard to sympathise with the victims and sometimes even the perpetrators of crime and their families. Wycliffe is happily married to Helen, a former typist. They have two children, and live in a large old house which overlooks the River Tamar estuary. The strains of Wycliffe's job, which means he has to spend long periods away from home investigating cases in the most distant parts of the county, sometimes take their toll on his family life. He has a fondness for literature and antique books. Wycliffe is described as being a slight man, only just over the regulation minimum height for police constables. He keeps fit by taking long walks along beaches and coastal paths. Other characters Several of Wycliffe's subordinates and colleagues are recurring characters. In many of the early cases, especially those in or near Plymouth, Detective Inspector Gill is featured. By comparison with Wycliffe's approach, he unsympathetically bullies suspects and witnesses. In later cases, Wycliffe relies more on the unpretentious Detective Sergeant (later Detective Inspector) Doug Kersey, and Detective Sergeant (also, later Detective Inspector) Lucy Lane, who manages to look like a fashion model even in the most cramped and squalid settings. Wycliffe tolerates rather than welcomes visits from his immediate superior, the bonhomous Deputy Chief Constable Bellings. The chief pathologist, Dr Franks, usually appears, but he and Wycliffe appear to have little in common. Television version In 1994, ITV filmed several of the novels as Wycliffe, over five seasons for a total of thirty-six episodes. In the series, Wycliffe was portrayed by actor Jack Shepherd. DI Doug Kersey was played by Jimmy Yuill and Helen Masters played DI Lucy Lane. There were some differences between the TV character and the original. For example, in the books, Wycliffe's children have grown up and are living away from home; in the TV series, both are still teenagers. The TV Wycliffe was an accomplished jazz pianist (as Jack Shepherd is in real life).

He was born in Kobe into a long line of physicians originally from Nagasaki. He was a descendant of Chinzan Narabayashi who had studied Western medicine with Dutch physicians at Dejima in the 17th century. He received his medical degree from the Tokyo University School of Medicine in 1946 and his Ph.D. from Tokyo University in 1955. In the same year, he was appointed Associate Professor, Department of Neuropsychiatry, at the Juntendo University School of Medicine in Tokyo. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1964. From 1968 to 1988, he was Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Juntendo University School of Medicine. Although trained originally as a neuropsychiatrist, he is best known for his pioneering work in stereotactic surgery, especially the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 1949 he constructed a stereotaxic apparatus based on drawings of that constructed in the United States by Victor Horsley and Robert H. Clarke and in 1951 performed the first stereotactic pallidotomy on an athetoid child. The next year he performed a procaine oil blocking of the pallidum of a patient with Parkinson's disease, successfully abolishing the rigidity and tremor symptomatic of this disease. In 1957 he established a private clinic specializing in stereotaxic neurosurgery which became a leading center for both research and treatment. Physicians came to visit from all over the world, and patients came for treatment from many countries. Narabayashi was known for his humility, modest manner, and sympathetic attitude toward students and junior physicians. Dr. Narabayashi lectured all over the world, but perhaps his most memorable trip was to Cuba in 1974 at the invitation of the Cuban Institute of Neuroscience. To his surprise, he was summoned to meet Fidel Castro who was quite interested in medicine. Castro presented him with a box of Cuban cigars on the bands of which was printed \\"To Hiro from Fidel\\". He died, not having recovered from the loss of his wife 5 months previously, and was buried in the family cemetery in Nagasaki. He left three grown children, the youngest, Yosuke, also a physician, and a distinguished legacy. References *Fodstad, Harald (2001) Obituary Hirotaro Narabayashi.

Development The Andrews A2 was designed by C.G. Andrews in Wellington, New Zealand, intended to compete in the market for a de Havilland Tiger Moth replacement in New Zealand's Aerial Topdressing industry. From the outset it was intended that a ¬Ω-scale model of the type be built and flown to prove the design, and this became the Andrews A1. The Andrews A1 is a conventional low-wing thick-section monoplane of plywood- covered spruce and steel construction with a bubble-type canopy, powered by a 65 hp Continental flat 4 air-cooled engine, and with spatted tailwheel undercarriage. Operational history First flown in 1957, the A1 successfully completed flight testing, but by that time the market for the larger Andrews A2 was clearly dominated by the more modern Fletcher Fu24. The sole Andrews A1, ZK-BLU, was sold to a private owner. It was owned for many years by Alan Rowe, best known as the designer of the Rowe R6b model aircraft, and is now owned by P.G.

Smith and starring Ryan Gosling and David Morse. The film, set in contemporary Montana, explores the relationship between a small-town high school football player (Gosling), and his troubled coach (Morse). The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.  Plot  A teenager at a personal crossroads finds himself questioning the things that have given his life meaning in this independent coming-of-age drama. Roy Chutney (Gosling) is a high school senior in the fictional Montana town of Blue Springs. Roy does not have an especially close relationship with his mother Evangelline (Kelly Lynch), and he has not seen his father in years. That does not prevent Roy from feeling emotionally devastated when he learns that his father has killed himself, and Roy's self-esteem takes a beating when he is cut from the high-school football team shortly afterward. Roy whiles away his time by swilling beer with his best friend, Tracy Two Dogs (Eddie Spears), and falling into a romance with Skyla (Clea DuVall), a barmaid at a local tavern, but Roy's short time on the high school gridiron seems to have impressed Gideon Ferguson (Morse), a local character who coaches an unsanctioned high school six-man football team when he is not delivering newspapers or trying to score a gig singing country songs at nearby honky- tonks. Gideon thinks that Roy has potential and asks him to join his team; encouraged by Gideon's belief in him, Roy agrees, and he persuades Tracy to tag along. While playing hardscrabble six-man football helps restore Roy's self-confidence, he finds it does not answer his questions about his future or his relationship with Skyla. When Gideon's overwhelming interest in Roy begins to lend credence to the rumors that Gideon is gay, Roy starts to wonder just why he was asked to join the team. Cast * Ryan Gosling as Roy Chutney * Amy Adams as Doreen * David Morse as Gideon Ferguson * Clea DuVall as Skyla Sisco * Kelly Lynch as Evangeline Chutney * Eddie Spears as Tracy Two Dogs  Production  Jay Farrar, founder of the alternative country bands Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt, composed the film's musical score. New songs were written and performed by Vic Chesnutt and Freakwater, and existing songs by Ryan Adams, Uncle Tupelo, and the Pernice Brothers were also included. Filming for the movie largely took place in Great Falls, Montana, and a series of small towns in the Great Falls vicinity.; The title of the film comes from the term \\"slaughter rule.\\" The unofficial rule provides for an athletic competition's premature conclusion if one team is ahead of the other by a certain number of points prior to game's end. The rule helps to avoid humiliating the losing team further. Release The film premiered in January 2002 during the Sundance Film Festival. Later that year, the film entered the South by Southwest Film Festival, Athens Film Festival, and AFI Film Festival. It went into limited release in January 2003. =Critical reception= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 31 reviews, and an average rating of 5.9/10.

The film has received mixed reviews. While the performances by Morse and Gosling were generally received positively, some reviews of the film criticized the script and the film itself. For example, reviewing the film for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised the performances of Gosling and Morse, but opined that the film is \\"confused\\" and \\"doesn't have much dramatic momentum\\". Manohla Dargis, in her review for the Los Angeles Times, praised the film's cinematography, but wrote that although the film has the virtue of sincerity, the story is \\"over- explained\\". Joe Leydon of Variety claimed the script \\"plays like a first draft\\". However, Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle thought that the \\"writing and directing team of twin brothers Alex and Andrew Smith have made an astonishingly good first feature\\". J. R. Jones, writing in Chicago Reader, described the film as \\"powerful\\" and especially praised David Morse's performance. =Accolades= The film received the FIPRESCI Prize in the 2002 Stockholm Film Festival and the Milagro Award in the 2002 Santa Fe Film Festival. The film was also nominated for the John Cassavetes Award in the 2003 Film Independent Spirit Awards and the Grand Jury Prize in the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. =Box office= During the first three months of 2003, the film grossed $13,134 in the United States.
