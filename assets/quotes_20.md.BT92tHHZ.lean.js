It has a number of well-preserved fifteenth- and sixteenth-century houses, and a thirteenth- century church dedicated to St Laurence. History The parish has been occupied for at least 2000 years; in the first century A.D. a Belgic settlement appeared, closely followed by a Romano-British farmstead near Hoffer bridge. A pagan English cemetery has also been found just north of the railway station. The parish itself was formed over the medieval period and is bounded on the north by the River Cam and on the north-east and southwest by the Hoffer and Shepreth brooks. Its south-east boundary follows an ancient road that runs north-east from Fowlmere, known as the Mareway from the 14th century (now the B1368), and further west by an earthwork known as Grim's ditch or Thriplow bank. Known as Foxetune at the time of the Domesday Book, the village's name means \\"farmstead where foxes are seen\\". The theologian William Selwyn lived in Foxton House in the village in the 19th century. Church There has been a church in Foxton since the 12th century, and it has been dedicated to St Laurence since at least 1225. The present building, consisting of a west tower, porch, and chancel with aisled and clerestoried nave was probably begun in the 13th century and extended over the following 200 years.  Demographics  Foxton's population is currently 1,260 (1,161 in 2001 census) split approximately 80:20 adults to children and occupying about 480 houses.  Village life  Restored dovecote originally built in 1706 Foxton has a mainline rail station (opened 1851) to London and is on the main bus route to Trumpington Park & Ride (where passengers can change for buses to Cambridge) and Royston. The village has one remaining public house, The White Horse, that has been open since at least 1841, though it was rebuilt after a fire in 1880. Former drinking establishments included The Blackamoor's Head (later renamed The Black Boy) and The Railway Inn, which opened in around 1780 and 1860 respectively; however, both had closed by the 1960s. Foxton is also home to a village shop and post office, primary school, learning centre, educational trust (Villiers Park) and The Burlington Press. The village has a recreation ground with children's playground, tennis courts, bowling green, football pitch and cricket pitches, and there is a modern village hall with meeting rooms and sports pavilion. The village has a conservation area, Foxton Dovecot and Meadow, established in 2006.Friends of the Dovecot Meadow (2006) Foxton Dovecot and Meadow. Foxton, United Kingdom: Friends of the Dovecot Meadow, 16pp. In 2010, the restoration of Rayner's dovecote received an award at the South Cambridgeshire District Council bi-annual built heritage awards. Foxton also has a teenage football club called Dynamo Foxton Football club, established by Marcus Kohler and others when the club departed from their former club (Whittlesford).  Literature  Foxton is known for being the subject of Rowland Parker's 1975 classic of local history The Common Stream. In it, Parker charts 2000 years of history of the village, from the Celts through to the Romans to the Saxons and the modern era.The Common Stream References External links * Foxton Website * Foxton History Website * Foxton Parish Council Website Villages in Cambridgeshire Civil parishes in Cambridgeshire South Cambridgeshire District ","title":"Foxton, Cambridgeshire"},{"id":"1768089","text":"The Al Akhawayn Campus Al Akhawayn University (, Berber: Tasdawit En Wawmaten) is an independent, public, not-for-profit, coeducational university located in Ifrane, Morocco, from the imperial city of Fez, in the midst of the Middle Atlas Mountains.

He won two batting titles and was named Major League Baseball's National League MVP. McGee primarily played center and right field, winning three Gold Glove Awards for defensive excellence. McGee spent the majority of his 18-year career playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, helping the Cardinals win the 1982 World Series with his outstanding performance in Game 3. A four-time All-Star, McGee accumulated 2,254 hits during his career. He is now a coach for the St. Louis Cardinals. Early life Willie Dean McGee, one of seven children, grew up in a devoutly religious household. His father Hurdice was both a machinist at the Oakland Naval Yards and a deacon in the Pentecostal church. Hurdice did not want his son to play any organized sports on Sundays, so McGee slipped out of the house on Sunday afternoons to pursue his passion for sports. Much later, McGee learned that his father knew that he was sneaking out to play baseball but decided to let him go anyway. Career McGee with the Nashville Sounds in 1980 Upon graduating from Harry Ells High School in Richmond, California in 1976, McGee was selected in the 7th round (152nd overall) of the June amateur entry draft by the Chicago White Sox. McGee declined the White Sox contract offer and opted instead to attend Diablo Valley Community College. A few months later, McGee was selected by the New York Yankees in the 1st round (15th overall) of the 1977 January amateur entry draft. From 1977 through 1981, McGee remained tucked away in the Yankees' minor league farm system, ascending no higher than the AA level during that time. =1982‚Äì1989= McGee's big break came when he was acquired by the St. Louis Cardinals from the Yankees' farm system on October 21, 1981, in a trade for pitcher Bob Sykes. In 1982, he was briefly assigned to the AAA Louisville Redbirds prior to being called up to St. Louis. In his rookie year, McGee batted .296, with 4 home runs and 56 runs batted in during the regular season. In the 1982 postseason, the 23-year-old McGee was quickly thrown into the national spotlight during St. Louis' run to a World Series title. His performance in Game 3 of the 1982 World Series ranks among the best in Series history. Not known for his power, McGee connected for two home runs and also delivered a spectacular defensive play in center field, capped by a leaping snare of a would-be 9th-inning Gorman Thomas home run that secured the Cardinals 6‚Äì2 victory. McGee became the third rookie to hit two home runs in a World Series game, joining two New York Yankees: Charlie Keller and one of the announcers for the 1982 Series, Tony Kubek. (Andruw Jones joined them in Game 1 of the 1996 World Series, and Michael Conforto joined them in Game 4 of the 2015 World Series.) McGee was an integral part of the Cardinals' unlikely Series win over the power-hitting Milwaukee Brewers, who were nicknamed \\"Harvey's Wallbangers\\" after team manager Harvey Kuenn. During the 1980s, McGee, along with Cardinals teammates Ozzie Smith, Tom Herr, and Vince Coleman, exemplified \\"Whiteyball\\", a style of baseball named after Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog. This style of baseball took advantage of St. Louis' spacious Busch Stadium and placed strong emphasis on fundamentals, pitching, defense, speedy baserunning, and smart situational in-game play. McGee hit for the cycle on June 23, 1984, in a classic Cardinals vs. Cubs matchup at Wrigley Field. The game was televised as NBC's Game of the Week. As the Cards led going into the bottom of the 9th, McGee was announced as NBC's \\"Player of the Game.\\" After Chicago's Ryne Sandberg hit two home runs‚Äîin the ninth and tenth innings, propelling the Cubs to a 12‚Äì11 victory‚ÄîNBC reported that McGee and Sandberg would share the honor. In 1985, McGee ranked first in the National League in batting average (.353, which is the second highest mark by a switch hitter in NL history), hits (216), and triples (18). He also ranked third in the National League in runs scored (114) and stolen bases (56). Additionally, he earned a Gold Glove Award and a Silver Slugger Award and was voted to the National League All-Star team. For his superb offensive and defensive performance, McGee was named the 1985 NL Most Valuable Player. His .353 batting average was the highest for a National League player since Bill Madlock hit .354 ten years earlier; between 1975 and 1993, McGee's .354 average also was second only to Tony Gwynn's 1987 NL average (.370). McGee's efforts helped propel the Cardinals into the postseason, where St. Louis defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series. However, St. Louis came up short in the 1985 World Series, as the Kansas City Royals defeated the Cardinals in seven games. The Series was known as the \\"I-70 Series,\\" named after Interstate 70, the highway that connects St. Louis to Kansas City. In 1987, Cardinals manager Herzog moved McGee to 5th in the batting order. McGee responded well to the move and drove in a career-high 105 runs. Again, McGee was a key component to the Cardinals' success as they enjoyed another fine season finishing as Eastern Division champs. After defeating the San Francisco Giants in a heated NL Championship Series, Herzog's Cardinals found themselves in their third World Series contest of the 1980s; the Minnesota Twins defeated the Cardinals in the 1987 World Series in seven games. McGee himself made the last out of the seventh game of the series, grounding out to third base. =1990‚Äì1995= would mark the end of the \\"Whiteyball\\" era in St. Louis. Amidst poor overall team performance, Herzog surprisingly announced his retirement on July 6. In an effort to begin the team's re-building process, McGee was traded to the American League's Oakland Athletics on August 29 for 25-year-old outfielder F√©lix Jos√© and two minor-league players (third baseman Stan Royer and pitcher Daryl Green). McGee's brief stint with Oakland, managed by Tony La Russa, helped propel the team to the 1990 World Series. This would be McGee's fourth trip to the Fall Classic; the Athletics, however, were pounded in the Series as the Cincinnati Reds would sweep the defending world champions in four games. Despite being traded to the AL, McGee had already accumulated 542 plate appearances in the National League, enough for him to qualify for the NL batting crown. Los Angeles' Eddie Murray (.330 average), the New York Mets' Dave Magadan (.328) and others gave chase. However, because no batter was able to catch McGee's .335 NL batting mark, he won his second batting title. McGee's accomplishment marked an odd first in major league history, in which the batting champion for one league ended the season as a member of the other league. In 1990, George Brett of the Kansas City Royals led the American league with a .329 batting average. Because McGee's batting average over the entire season was only .324, neither league's batting champion led the Major Leagues in batting; that honor fell to Eddie Murray. On December 3, 1990, McGee signed a multi-year contract with the San Francisco Giants. This decision allowed him to continue his professional career in the area in which he was born, raised, and resided with his family. With the Giants, he remained a consistent and productive player, batting near or above .300 each year until an ankle injury befell him in . Attempting to rebound from injury, McGee signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox on June 6, 1995, and played in only 67 games that season. McGee had one hit in four at-bats in the Cleveland Indians' Division Series sweep of Boston. =Return to St. Louis= On December 15, 1995, McGee signed as a free agent and returned to St. Louis for good. Coincidentally, he was reunited with former Oakland manager Tony La Russa, who had just inked a multi-year deal on October 23 to become St. Louis' new skipper. One of the lighter moments of the 1996 season came in the form of a commercial that McGee recorded with Ozzie Smith. As part of the team's \\"Baseball like it oughta be\\" ad campaign, Smith and McGee‚Äîunder the aliases of \\"Henry Smith\\" and \\"Walter McGee\\" respectively‚Äîpartially ad-libbed several TV spots dressed as two old men sitting in a bar talking about the Cardinals. Shocked that the shy McGee would do such an outrageous thing, teammates were enthralled by watching outtakes from the TV spots, some of which can be seen on a commemorative video about the Cardinals' 1996 season. An aged veteran at this point in his career, McGee's role as outfielder became limited, and he averaged about 300 at bats a year. Despite his limited role, he found his stroke again with St. Louis. He batted .307 and .300 in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and he provided fans with dramatic offensive sparks that recalled his earlier years. In St. Louis' 1997 home opener at Busch Memorial Stadium, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning and the score tied 1‚Äì1, McGee hit a pinch-hit home run to win the game, which provided a memorable highlight to cap his remarkable career with the St. Louis Cardinals. On August 5, 1999, Willie made a brilliant shoestring catch on a looping fly ball hit by San Diego Padres' outfielder Tony Gwynn. Had McGee not caught that ball, Gwynn would have recorded his 3,000th major league hit. In that same game, St. Louis Cardinals' First baseman Mark McGwire hit his 500th major league home run. McGee played his final game on October 3, 1999, at age 40 and as the third-oldest player in the majors. McGee was the inspiration for the song ‚Äú#51‚Äù by the now defunct St. Louis rock band Zephyr. The song's chorus used catchy guitar rhythms to praise McGee for his ability to drive home runners in scoring position.

The season after his retirement as player, McGee was honored with a special ceremony at Busch Memorial Stadium. There has been some support among fans for a formal retirement of McGee's number 51 uniform number by the Cardinals. On March 6, 2013, the St. Louis Cardinals announced they had hired McGee as a special assistant to General Manager John Mozeliak. McGee's role as special assistant included working with outfielders in the Cardinals' minor league system as well as monitoring the organization's minor league players. McGee was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame on August 16, 2014. On October 23, 2017, the Cardinals added McGee to their major league coaching staff. As of December 2017, McGee is listed on the Cardinals' roster as an assistant coach, with 51 as his uniform number. McGee's responsibilities with the Cards include outfielding, base running, and hitting. On August 14, 2020, McGee announced he would be sitting out the remainder of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is the eighth installment in the famous Kamen Rider Series of tokusatsu shows. It is a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei, and aired on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and the Tokyo Broadcasting System from October 4, 1987 to October 9, 1988. With its very dramatic storyline and its twist of the Kamen Rider having a tragic relationship with his nemesis, the installment not only became very popular in Japan, but also in many countries where it was aired. The series is often regarded as a TV classic and is considered by many as the most popular Kamen Rider show of the late 1980s, as well as one of the most famous of all Kamen Riders in the Showa period. The series also received a manga adaptation. Kamen Rider Black RX was a direct sequel to this series. Synopsis After being kidnapped by the cult Gorgom on the night of their 19th birthday, stepbrothers Kohtaro Minami and Nobuhiko Akizuki were submitted to a cyborg surgery with the purpose of becoming the candidates for the next Gorgom Creation King. Both of them are called Century Kings and are destined to best each other in a final battle - whoever wins will become the next Creation King. Kotaro escaped before getting brainwashed (which is the final step in the surgery), with help from his foster father and turned against Gorgom. He soon finds out the horrific truth from his stepfather: Gorgom originally killed his true parents and, since both Kohtaro and Nobuhiko were born on the day of a solar eclipse, are referred to as \\"Black Sun\\" and \\"Shadow Moon\\". Kotaro, taking on the name of Kamen Rider Black, was determined to rescue his stepbrother from Gorgom while protecting Japan. However, later in the series, Nobuhiko emerged as Shadow Moon to fight Kohtaro with the survivor becoming the next Creation King.

GlyR is an ionotropic receptor that produces its effects through chloride current. It is one of the most widely distributed inhibitory receptors in the central nervous system and has important roles in a variety of physiological processes, especially in mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal cord and brainstem. The receptor can be activated by a range of simple amino acids including glycine, Œ≤-alanine and taurine, and can be selectively blocked by the high-affinity competitive antagonist strychnine. Caffeine is a competitive antagonist of GlyR. Gephyrin has been shown to be necessary for GlyR clustering at inhibitory synapses. GlyR is known to colocalize with the GABAA receptor on some hippocampal neurons. Nevertheless, some exceptions can occur in the central nervous system where the GlyR Œ±1 subunit and gephyrin, its anchoring protein, are not found in dorsal root ganglion neurons despite the presence of GABAA receptors. Arrangement of subunits Strychnine-sensitive GlyRs are members of a family of ligand-gated ion channels. Receptors of this family are arranged as five subunits surrounding a central pore, with each subunit composed of four Œ± helical transmembrane segments. There are presently four known isoforms of the ligand-binding Œ±-subunit (Œ±1-4) of GlyR (GLRA1, GLRA2, GLRA3, GLRA4) and a single Œ≤-subunit (GLRB). The adult form of the GlyR is the heteromeric Œ±1Œ≤ receptor, which is believed to have a stoichiometry (proportion) of three Œ±1 subunits and two Œ≤ subunits or four Œ±1 subunits and one Œ≤ subunit. The Œ±-subunits are also able to form functional homopentamers in heterologous expression systems in African clawed frog oocytes or mammalian cell lines, which are useful for studies of channel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The Œ≤ subunit is unable to form functional channels without Œ± subunits but determines the synaptic localization of GlyRs and the pharmacological profile of glycinergic currents. Glycine receptors in diseases Disruption of GlyR surface expression or reduced ability of expressed GlyRs to conduct chloride ions results in the rare neurological disorder, hyperekplexia. The disorder is characterized by an exaggerated response to unexpected stimuli which is followed by a temporary but complete muscular rigidity often resulting in an unprotected fall. Chronic injuries as a result of the falls are symptomatic of the disorder. A mutation in GLRA1 is responsible for some cases of stiff person syndrome.

It is one of the most important myths of the culture of Chile. Legend According to Chilean legend, the Caleuche is a large ghost ship sailing the seas around Chilo√© (a small island off the coast of Chile) at night. The Caleuche is said to be a being who is conscious and sentient. The ship appears as a beautiful and bright white sailing ship, with 3 masts of 5 sails each, always full of lights and with the sounds of a party on board, but quickly disappears again, leaving no evidence of its presence. The ghost ship is also known to be able to navigate under water, just like another well known ghost ship, the Flying Dutchman. =Versions= There are various versions of the legend of the Caleuche. One version claims that it is crewed by the drowned, who are brought to the ship by three Chilote mythological figures, two sisters: the sirena chilota (a type of mermaid) and the Pincoya and their brother, the Pincoy. Once aboard, the dead can resume an existence as if they were alive again. A similar version of the legend is that the mythical ship appears in the sea of the Chilo√© Archipelago where it captivates fishermen and sailors with its enchanting music to enslave them as part of their crew for eternity. These slaves are defined as eternally having a leg folded over their back, similar to the Imbunche of Chilote mythology. Another common version is that it is the magic ship that the Warlocks of Chilo√© use to have parties and transport their goods. It is also used by the warlocks every three months when they go on a journey to improve their magical abilities. The warlocks are only able to reach the ship by summoning caballo marino chilote. This is because Millalobo (the king of the seas) has prohibited any other people from boarding the ship or getting to it by any other means. Another version is that the crew of the Caleuche makes magical pacts with certain traders ensuring them prosperity in exchange for favors such as using their houses for parties or other illegal or dark purposes. Because of this version of the legend when a person in Chilo√© gets rich quickly, it is often attributed to his having made a pact with the crew of the Caleuche. Rumors like these were rampant following the 1960 Valdivia earthquake because some houses were untouched by the fires that swept through Chilo√© afterwards. In that same decade there were stories that the sounds of a ship dropping anchor could be heard around the houses of many prosperous merchants in the Chilo√© archipelago. These were supposedly the sounds of the Caleuche stealthily delivering goods and treasures to those with whom it had a pact. However, most people rejected this supernatural explanation and instead blamed the merchant's prosperity on mortal, rather than supernatural, smugglers. In media The legend of the Caleuche is referred to in Alastair Reynolds' 2001 novel Chasm City, when the Chilean crewmembers of a generation ship discover a \\"ghost ship\\" trailing the flotilla of colony vessels and dub the ship Caleuche. The Caleuche is a living vessel which travels the world, carrying a crew of monster hunters in The Luke Coles Book Series by Josh Walker. In film and television, Ra√∫l Ruiz's Three Crowns of the Sailor (1983) and Litoral (2008) and Jorge Olgu√≠n's Caleuche: The Call of the Sea (2012) are all loosely inspired by the legend.

It opened on May 28, 1994. The resort is owned and operated by Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Disney's Wilderness Lodge is located in the Magic Kingdom Resort Area on Bay Lake. The resort is also located near Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground. A similarly-themed resort, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, is located at the Disneyland Resort in California. Resort This hotel was designed by Peter Dominick. It is modeled after the atmosphere of the national parks of the western United States and features both natural and Native American elements. The main building was modeled after the Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone National Park. An artificial geyser and hot springs are located on the resort grounds. The Resort has eight floors of Lodgepole pine imported from Oregon, as well as 55 foot, authentic totem poles, and an 82 ft fireplace representing the colorful rocks of the Grand Canyon. This display represents Northwestern Native American artifacts, myths, legends, and stories. The Lodge is a 4-star deluxe Walt Disney World resort. Lodge guests have access to restaurants, a spa and fitness center, theme pools, jacuzzi hot tubs, a kids' zone and babysitting center, and fun and educational activities for adults and children. Boat transportation is available to the Magic Kingdom, Disney's Contemporary Resort, and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground. In November 2007, the resort received designation as part of the Florida Green Lodging Program. Boulder Ridge Villas Originally known as The Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge, a Disney Vacation Club timeshare resort on the site, were announced in 1998, and the property first accepted guests in November 2000. The Boulder Ridge Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge are adjacent to Disney's Wilderness Lodge, whose design is based on the National Park lodges of America's western states. The Vacation Club Villas are themed to the antecedent lodgings built by workers on the transcontinental railroad in the late 19th century. The main building for the villas has railroad artwork and memorabilia on display, including two train cars from Walt Disney's ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad. The accommodations include Studio units with a kitchenette, as well as one and two-bedroom villas with a larger kitchen and living space. In late 2015, Disney began an extensive building project to expand the Villas with waterside units similar to those found over the water at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, as well as recreation and dining facilities. Copper Creek Villas & Cabins opened in summer 2017 as the second DVC property at the resort, which consists of 26 Cascade Cabins which were built along the shoreline of the resort, and the entire South wing of the original resort building, which was converted from regular hotel rooms to 158 DVC units.

It was awarded the Grand Prix du roman de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise that year. Plot Am√©lie, a young Belgian woman who spent the first five years of her life in Japan, returns to Japan as a young adult, signing a one-year contract as a translator at the prestigious company Yumimoto. Through a series of comical cultural misunderstandings, Am√©lie, who begins at the bottom of the corporate ladder, manages to descend even lower. During her time at Yumimoto, she is the direct subordinate of Fubuki Mori, whose friendly demeanor quickly disappears when Am√©lie unwittingly oversteps herself. Bored and frustrated with how she is apparently not assigned to do anything productive, Am√©lie tries to take the initiative by memorizing the company's list of employees and delivering the mail, only to be reprimanded for \\"stealing someone else's job.\\" When she is assigned to photocopy the departmental manager's documents, which she discovers are the rules to his golf club, Amelie is forced to redo her work when the manager returns it with the complaint that the copies are off- centre and that she must not use the feeder for the copier. While she is redoing the task, the kindly Mr. Tenshi takes notice of her and asks for her help in drafting a report about the new method of manufacturing reduced-fat butter developed in Belgium. Am√©lie's contributions to Mr. Tenshi's report make it a big success and she requests not to be given credit. Though it seems her transfer to Mr. Tenshi's department is imminent, Fubuki feels offended as this constitutes a violation of the company's hierarchy and she exposes everything to the vice-president, who severely scolds Mr Tenshi and Am√©lie, and sees to it that Am√©lie writes no more reports and strictly sticks to doing duties assigned by Ms Mori. Although advised by Mr Tenshi not to do so, Am√©lie decides to confront Ms Mori and talk to her personally. This encounter can be seen as the main juncture of the novel, as both characters feel the other should apologise, but at the same time each of them fails to recognise why she herself should do the same. The main difference is that while Am√©lie feels her progress in her career from useless work to the place where she actually can use her skills has been hindered for no other reason than maliciousness, Ms Mori interprets Am√©lie's move as being against her as Am√©lie was trying to pass her by, thus violating the correct hierarchy. Ms Mori had to suffer and work hard for years to achieve her position and it was inconceivable to her to imagine that Am√©lie might achieve the same level of hierarchy within only a couple of weeks. From that point on, the relationship between them changes from a fairly good one (which, though, only Am√©lie would describe as 'friendship') to animosity, although still accompanied by respect and admiration from Am√©lie's side, which Ms Mori either fails to notice or chooses to ignore. Am√©lie proves herself useless at the tasks she is subsequently asked to do in the Accounts Department, as she apparently suffers from dyscalculia to some extent, while Ms Mori thinks Am√©lie is making mistakes on purpose to sabotage the company and the manager herself. Another dialogue reveals the differences between the different concepts of responsibility in Japanese and Western cultures. While for Ms Mori the manager is directly responsible for the mistakes of their staff (You made the mistakes deliberately only to expose me to the public ridicule), Am√©lie thinks everybody is responsible for their own mistakes (I ridiculed only myself, not you). The biggest mistake Am√©lie commits comes after Ms Mori has been severely abused by the vice-president in front of all the department. When Ms Mori, not having shown tears to her colleagues, goes to the bathroom to let her feelings out in private, Am√©lie follows her to console her. While from Am√©lie's point of view Ms Mori is not in a shameful position and offering a consolation like that is only a kind-hearted gesture, Ms Mori feels utterly ashamed to be seen showing her feelings and misunderstands Am√©lie's following her as vengefulness and hostility. The next day Am√©lie is assigned the job of a bathroom cleaner by Ms Mori. With six more months of her one-year contract to go, Am√©lie decides to endure until the end, which might be shameful from the Western point of view, but from the Japanese point of view means not losing face. After her contract finishes in January 1991, she returns to Belgium and starts publishing: her first novel Hygi√®ne de l'assassin appearing in 1992, she receives a brief congratulation note from Ms Mori in 1993.BookerTalkPurdue.edu. docs, Christine Vance, ‚ÄúCulture Shock in a Japanese Firm: Am√©lie Nothomb‚Äôs Stupeur et Tremblements‚Äù,5-21-2010New York Times, Books, Susan Chira, Lost in Translation‚Äù, March 25, 2001Kirkus Reviews Explanation of title According to the novel, in Japan, protocol states that in the presence of the Emperor, who until 1947 had been considered a living god, a person must demonstrate his or her reverence with fear and trembling, though most Japanese citizens today are unaware of this injunction.

It has an ugly face, and legs without feet.  Legend  The Trauco is a mythical entity who inhabits the woods of Chilo√©, an island in the south of Chile. It has a powerful magnetism that attracts young and middle-aged women. According to myth, the Trauco's wife is the wicked and ugly Fiura. The trauco carries a small stone-headed hatchet that he uses to strike trees in the forest to symbolize his sexual potency. Whomever the Trauco chooses will go to him, even if she is sleeping, and fall enraptured at his feet. No woman can resist his magical attraction; all have sexual intercourse with him. Some men of Chilo√© fear the Trauco, as his gaze can be deadly. When a single woman is pregnant and no one steps forward as the father, people assume that the Trauco is the father. Because the Trauco is irresistible, the woman is considered blameless. The Trauco is sometimes invoked to explain sudden or unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women. Edith Rebolledo Muller, MSc in Sociology, states the following \\"In fact, teen pregnancy has its explanation in this myth, as a way to justify this shame. Then it will be cleansed by marriage, as an institution that allows regulating and holding bodies into submission\\".  Media  The Trauco appears in The Luke Coles Book Series by Josh Walker where he functions as an antagonist in some of the subplots. References * John E. Roth.

Operational history =1943= Hale was launched 4 April 1943 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. G. H. Chase, granddaughter of Senator Hale; and commissioned at Boston 15 June 1943, Commander Karl F. Poehlmann in command. Hale conducted shakedown training in the Caribbean and training exercises on the East Coast before departing Halifax for the Pacific combat zone 21 September. She arrived Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal 9 October 1943. Hale departed 8 November 1943 for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands, the first step in America's amphibious sweep across Micronesia. She screened aircraft carriers in strikes on Tarawa 18-20 November, took part in the bombardment of Betio Island 19 November, and supported the landings by Marines next day. During the air attacks that followed, Hale's gunners accounted for several aircraft. After covering the retirement of damaged carrier Independence (CVL-22) for 2 days she rejoined the carrier striking force for attacks against the Marshall Islands, next target of the Pacific amphibious forces. = 1944 = Hale to Pearl Harbor 8 December to train the next assault and sailed 21 December for the Ellice Islands. She departed 21 January 1944 for the invasion of the Marshalls, pounding Maloelap and Wotje atolls 29 January to 22 February, before and after the landings. Executive officer LT CDR D.W. Wilson assumed command 2 March. Underway from Kwajalein 11 March, she sailed to Guadalcanal to perform anti-submarine patrol during the loading operations, and departed 27 March escorting reinforcements to Cape Torokina, Bougainville. After acting as antisubmarine screen and screening ship for escort carriers supporting the Hollandia landings in New Guinea, Hale returned to Seeadler Harbor 4-7 May. She then steamed to the Solomons for the final rehearsals for the Marianas campaign. The ship then took part in pre-invasion strikes on Guam, returned briefly to Eniwetok 14 July, to support the Guam landings 21 July. Hale returned to Eniwetok 4 August 1944, and departed 6 days later for assault and support operations in Hawaiian waters preparatory to the Leyte landings. She got underway with troop transports bound for Manus on 15 September, and departed 14 October with the Southern Attack Force bound for the Philippines. On 18 October her group was joined by Nashville (CL-43), with General Douglas MacArthur embarked. Hale entered Leyte Gulf early 20 October and helped troop units take Dulag airfield by providing accurate fire support. She then joined Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague's escort carriers 25 October after their valiant fight in the battle off Samar. The destroyer next joined escort screening units for troop reinforcements at Morotai and landed them at Tacloban, Leyte, 14 November. After another such voyage from Hollandia to Leyte in November, aiding the buildup in the Philippines, Hale sailed 24 November via New Guinea, the Marshalls, and Pearl Harbor arriving San Francisco 22 December 1944. = 1945 = Hale returned to the Pacific war in early 1945, arriving Pearl Harbor 25 February. Sailing to Ulithi, she departed 14 March with Rear Admiral Forrest Sherman's Essex (CV-9) carrier task force to attack enemy air installations prior to the landings on Okinawa. The group suffered casualties, including Franklin (CV-13) and Wasp (CV-18) from air attack 19-21 March as Hale's gunners shot down several of the attackers. Departing the seas off Japan proper, the carrier force screened by Hale and other destroyers turned to Okinawa, flying close support and bombardment missions before, during, and after the initial assault 1 April. During the harrowing period off Okinawa Hale rescued two fighter pilots, drove off innumerable kamikaze attacks and survived a near miss during a bombing attack. The veteran destroyer departed Okinawa 11 April and after stops at Ulithi and Guam arrived Leyte Gulf in the screen of South Dakota (BB-57) 1 June 1945. She then escorted Washington (BB-56) to Guam and met tug Munsee (AT-107), towing the bow section of cruiser Pittsburgh (CA-72), torn off in the great typhoon off Okinawa, and brought her to Apra Harbor. The ship then sailed to join the 3d Fleet at Leyte Gulf 21 June. Hale departed as a unit of Admiral Marc Mitscher's famed Task Force 38, 1 July 1945, bound for crippling strike against Japan itself. Hale took part in shore bombardment of factories at Hamamatsu 29 July. As the war against Japan ended 15 August, Hale tool up duties as air-sea rescue ship offshore during the landing of occupation forces. She entered Tokyo Bay 16 September 1945, and departed 1 October for the United States carrying 100 veterans. She arrived Seattle 19 October 1945 and was placed in commission in reserve at San Diego until decommissioning 15 January 1947. = 1951 - 1960 = With the outbreak of the Korean War and the increase of tension throughout the world, Hale was taken out of reserve, commissioning at Long Beach 24 March 1951. After a shakedown cruise she sailed via the Panama Canal to her new home port, Newport, R.I., arriving 11 July 1951. After refresher training she departed 22 April 1952 to serve with the 6th Fleet in Mediterranean waters in support of American diplomacy in this vital and troubled region. After stopping at 16 ports in the course of her operations, Hale returned to Newport 23 October 1952. For the next 1¬Ω years the destroyer performed a variety of tasks: antisubmarine training and development exercises off the Atlantic coast, plane guard duty or carrier operations in the Gulf of Mexico, and a training cruise for midshipmen of the Naval Academy. After a modernization overhaul at Philadelphia Navy Yard, September 1953 to January 1954, Hale departed 1 June 1954 for a world cruise. Transiting the Panama Canal and entering the Pacific she proceeded to the Far East. She formed a part of America's ever-present naval strength lending stability to the area. Transiting the Suez Canal 17 November 1954, she visited many ports in 6th Fleet waters before returning to Newport 18 December 1954. Hale continued her vital pattern of readiness exercises including serving as the Destroyer Force Gunnery School Ship at Newport, until 6 November 1956. Getting underway for the Mediterranean once more, she rendezvoused with 6th Fleet ships and stood by in the eastern Mediterranean during the Suez crisis, helping to avert a larger conflict and protecting American interests. She returned to Newport 20 February 1957. In June Hale participated in one of the greatest international naval reviews in history, joining some 60 U.S. ships and vessels of 17 other nations in the 350th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. A second Midshipman cruise and NATO exercises in the North Atlantic closed out 1957. She began her second world cruise 23 July 1958, sailing to Naples, through the Suez Canal to India and Japan, and back to San Diego after operations with the 7th Fleet off Taiwan. She returned to Newport port via the Panama Canal 24 November 1958. Transfer of Hale to Colombia as ARC Antioquia (DD-01), 1961. In the Mediterranean from August 1959 - February 1960 Hale continued a peace-keeping and goodwill role. She returned to Newport 26 February 1959. After a period of important experimental work in antisubmarine warfare with nuclear submarines, Hale decommissioned at Boston 30 July 1960. Hale received six battle stars for World War II service. = ARC Antioquia (DD-01) = Hale was transferred to Colombia 23 January 1961 under the Military Assistance Program and served as ARC Antioquia (DD-01).

Walter A. Netsch (February 23, 1920 ‚Äì June 15, 2008), was an American architect based in Chicago. He was most closely associated with the brutalist style of architecture as well as with the firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. His signature aesthetic is known as Field Theory and is based on rotating squares into complex shapes. He may be best known as the lead designer for the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado and its famous Cadet Chapel. The Cadet Area at the Academy was named a National Historic Landmark in 2004. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Overview After graduating from The Leelanau School, a boarding school in Michigan, Netsch studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then enlisted in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He earned his bachelor of architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1943 and began his career as an architect working for L. Morgan Yost in Kenilworth, Illinois. In 1947, he joined Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, which initially assigned him to work in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Later he became a partner for design in SOM and remained with the firm until 1979. He began his own practice in 1981.Thomas E.

University Hall at the University of Illinois at Chicago, part of Netsch's original design for the Chicago Circle campus. Following his work on the Air Force Academy, Netsch led the team which designed the original University of Illinois Circle Campus. The campus design grouped buildings into functional clusters and now constitutes most of the east campus buildings at the University of Illinois at Chicago. During his career, Netsch designed 15 libraries, as well as academic buildings for colleges and universities in the United States and Japan, including Northwestern University, Miami University, Wells College, Illinois Institute of Technology, Sophia University, Texas Christian University, University of Chicago, and University of Iowa. He did the initial design for the Inland Steel Building in Chicago; built circa 1956-1957, this was the first skyscraper built in the Chicago Loop after the Great Depression. He also designed the east wing of the Art Institute of Chicago. Netsch designed several buildings at Northwestern University and the campus and buildings of Montgomery College in Takoma Park, Maryland, and was the focus of an exhibit at the Northwestern University Library in February‚ÄìMarch 2006 as well as a monograph, Walter A. Netsch, FAIA: A Critical Appreciation and Sourcebook, published in May 2008. Recognition Netsch taught at several universities, received numerous awards and honorary degrees, and served as a trustee at the Rhode Island School of Design and a member of the Board of Governors at Northwestern University Library. From 1986 to 1989, he served as Commissioner of the Chicago Park District, appointed by Mayor Harold Washington.Netsch takes his wine and cheese to the parks.

History Aylesford was opened by the South Eastern Railway, which merged with local rival London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) on 1 January 1899 to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). The station became part of the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923, and passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways.

Station Building Aylesford Station building The section of the line surrounding Aylesford Station passes through what was part of the Preston Hall Estate, the then home of Edward Betts, the railway contractor who built this part of the Medway Valley Line. Consequently, the station building is much grander than other country stations along the line. The station buildings are gabled and highly decorated, built in Kentish ragstone with Caen stone dressings, in part reflecting a simplified version of the style of Preston Hall. Windows replicate those at Aylesford Priory. Following restoration and refurbishment, the station building received an Ian Allan award in 2001, commemorated by a plaque in the waiting room/booking office, which is now in use as an Indian Takeaway Restaurant.

Lightfoot, (1999), Parthenius of Nicaea: the poetical fragments and the Erotika pathemata, page 9.

He subsequently visited Neapolis, where he taught Greek to Virgil, according to Macrobius.Macrobius, Sat. v. 18. Parthenius is said to have lived until the accession of Tiberius in 14 AD. Parthenius was a writer of elegies, especially dirges, and of short epic poems. He is sometimes called \\"the last of the Alexandrians\\". Erotica Pathemata His only surviving work, the Erotica Pathemata (, Of the Sorrows of Love), was set out, the poet says in his preface, \\"in the shortest possible form\\" and dedicated to the poet Cornelius Gallus, as \\"a storehouse from which to draw material\\". Erotica Pathemata is a collection of thirty-six epitomes of love-stories, all of which have tragic or sentimental endings, taken from histories and historicised fictions as well as poetry. As Parthenius generally quotes his authorities, these stories are valuable as affording information on the Alexandrian poets and grammarians. =Contents= The mythical or legendary characters whose stories are presented in Erotica Pathemata are as follows. # Lyrcus # Polymela # Evippe # Oenone # Leucippus, son of Xanthius # Pallene # Hipparinus of Heraclea # Herippe # Polycrite # Leucone, wife of Cyanippus # Byblis # Calchus # Harpalyce # Antheus, loved and killed by Cleoboea # Daphne # Laodice # Cratea, mother of Periander # Neaera # Pancrato, daughter of Iphimedeia # A√´ro, daughter of Oenopion # Pisidice of Methymna # Nanis # Chilonis # Hipparinus of Syracuse # Phayllus # Apriate (see Trambelus) # Alcinoe # Clite # Daphnis # Celtine # Dimoetes # Anthippe (see Epirus) # Assaon # Corythus # Eulimene # Arganthone Other works In Parthenius' own time, he was not famous for his prose but his poems.

The licenses generally include restrictions, which vary from band to band. Spectrum may be divided according to use. As indicated in a graph from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), frequency allocations may be represented by different types of services which vary in size. Many options exist when applying for a broadcast license; the FCC determines how much spectrum to allot to licensees in a given band, according to what is needed for the service in question. The determination of frequencies used by licensees is done through frequency allocation, which in the United States is specified by the FCC in a table of allotments. The FCC is authorized to regulate spectrum access for private and government uses; however, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the Commerce Department allocates spectrum for use by the federal government (including the military). In some cases (e.g. CB radio), the public may use spectrum without a license. Commercial users (such as television, AM/FM radio, and some types of two-way communications) will receive an FCC assignment to a portion of spectrum, which may be a single frequency or a band of frequencies. In issuing broadcast licenses the FCC relies on \\"comparative hearings\\", whereby the most qualified user will be granted use of the spectrum to best serve the public interest; researchers have pointed out that this procedure favors incumbents.Krattenmaker, T. G. & Pwwe, L. A. Jr. (1994). Regulating Broadcast programming. Violation of the terms of a license (due to technical fault or illegal content) may result in fines or revocation of the license. Licenses have also been jeopardized by misrepresentation on the part of the holder or failure to keep a public file (in the U.S. and Canada). Unlicensed broadcasting refers to legal devices allowed to transmit at low power without a license and pirate stations, which violate the law.  Economics  In the U.S. broadcast licenses were issued for only a nominal payment, but economist Ronald Coase challenged the FCC's approach. Coase proposed that, as for other resources (land, metal, etc.), the market should regulate the use of radio spectrum. This proposition is based on the Coase theorem: with well-defined property rights, the free market will allocate resources to their most efficient use if transaction costs are low. Coase's theory indicated that broadcast licenses in a spectrum that was limited had high economic value, which should be paid on the open market. Licenses are increasingly offered via spectrum auctions; however, this fails to consider non-commercial educational users (who are shut out of the process for economic reasons). Licensing is conducted by a broadcasting authority (a government agency) to manage the radio-frequency spectrum and implement public policy, such as that regarding the concentration of media ownership. In the U.S. the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not assign licenses to exclusive users, instead permitting qualified users to apply for a license. The Radio Act of 1927 established the regulatory premise that the spectrum belongs to the public, and licensees have no property rights to use it. Although the spectrum is licensed to bidders, its purchase does not entail ownership or rights but the privilege of using that portion of the spectrum.  Process  The process of obtaining a new broadcast license may be lengthy. A broadcast engineer first determines an available frequency, which may be unavailable in a crowded media market (such as a metropolitan area). If a frequency is available, an engineering study is submitted with an application to the broadcasting authority, to demonstrate that the licensee will not cause RF interference to existing stations. There is a limited term for the license, once acquired. According to the United States Government Printing Office in 1997, the term could exceed 8 years; however, this has been shortened to five years or less (depending on whether the FCC requires further evaluation). A construction permit is first issued, with the license receiving approval when the station certifies that the permit has been executed (after testing to ensure that all parameters are within allowable tolerances). Once a facility is built and operational, it may be allowed to operate under program test authority until the license is issued (or denied). Where a station is close to an international border, a license may also need to be approved by the foreign country's broadcasting authority for frequency coordination. This is done even if the border is outside of a station's predicted broadcast range, since radio propagation sometimes causes stations to be heard outside their service area. Existing stations apply for permits and license amendments when making changes to their facilities (such as relocation to another site, changing the radio antenna height, making changes to a directional antenna's radiation pattern, or when adding‚Äîor converting to‚Äîdigital broadcasting). Other situations (such as a change in the city of license) are covered in rulemaking proceedings in the U.S., which may be a prerequisite to moving a station a significant distance (leaving its original community outside its new coverage area). Temporary situations are covered by special temporary authority (STA) to operate at a variance from the license or permit or a Restricted Service Licence (RSL) to operate for a fixed period at reduced power. While these are FCC and Ofcom terms, respectively, other countries have similar regulations. In the U.S., court cases can prolong the process when mutually exclusive applications are received. The FCC opens application window periods of about a week. Some applications have been pending for years; others end up in administrative law courts or arbitration, sometimes with one applicant seeking a buyout of another.  Technical specifications  Management of technical specifications (such as those in broadcast television systems) is normally undertaken as a part of broadcast licensing in each country. Radio bands carry signals (such as video and audio, digital and analog, narrowband, broadband and content), and are licensed differently. The broadcast license typically specifies the following minimum information: *Geographic coordinates, with exact latitude and longitude *Carrier frequency and bandwidth *Modulation type[s] *Effective radiated power (ERP) *Height above average terrain (HAAT) *Directional antenna radiation pattern, specified at several azimuths Additionally, it often specifies: *Operating hours (for mediumwave and shortwave) *Transmitter power output (TPO) (before any attenuation or gain) *Broadcast auxiliary services (BAS) linking studio and transmitter sites *Antenna brand and model *Height above mean sea level (AMSL) and above ground level (AGL) *Backup facilities (which may have separate licenses) *Additional service authorizations (subcarriers, digital radio) Some countries (such as the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in Canada) specify radio format or the genre of television programming, to ensure diversity. Community stations (such as class A television service and LPFM stations in the U.S.) may be required to broadcast local content each week. U.S. broadcast translator licenses prohibit local content on FM, while LPTV stations can choose, except those tied to a DTV station as a fill-in translator or booster to overcome the shortcomings of the ATSC system mandated by the FCC. Sharing In some cases, two stations may share the same frequency in the same area, or even the same facility. Time sharing has on occasion been used when two applicants have an equal number of points, mainly with LPFM stations. In FCC auction 1000 for the 600 MHz band, TV stations were paid to leave the air in crowded markets (to facilitate repacking of stations on TV channels 38 to 51 into those already using 2 to 36), but are allowed to move the license to another existing station, keeping their virtual channel numbers and must-carry rights. Each licensee is responsible for the content on their own channels, while both are jointly responsible for the technical operation of the transmitter, antenna, and tower. In the city of New York, 89.1 MHz is reserved for the United Nations; however, it is used instead by WNYU-FM and WNYU-FM1, unless the U.N. should ever apply to use it.  Renewal  Licensing requirements differ for public radio and television and for community radio and television compared to commercial applicants. Licensees must be aware of deadlines, from original application to renewal, which vary by stateFederal Communications Commission Broadcast License Renewal Filing & Expiration Dates and include license expiration and dates for renewals. The form for renewal of a broadcast license in the United States is FCC Form 303-S. While the Form 303-S License Application consists of yes-or-no questions and certifications, the process of renewing the license is complex; the FCC requires that licensees certify that they were in compliance with all rules and regulations during the prior license term. If a license has been acquired in the middle of a term, the licensee will be evaluated from that point to the end of the license term. Misrepresentation to the FCC may lead to the loss of a license.

Its route consists of Cata√±o ‚áÜ Old San Juan docking at the AcuaExpreso Cata√±o Terminal in Cata√±o on the route's southwestern point and at the AcuaExpreso San Juan Terminal in Pier 2 of the San Juan Port in Old San Juan on the route's northeastern point. The ferry crosses the San Juan Bay with its services running from mornings to evenings seven days a week as the weather and maritime conditions permit. Although the service is heavily used by tourists, its primary purpose is to serve as a transportation hub for those who live nearby Cata√±o but work in San Juan in complementation with AcuaExpreso. Despite what the service's name implies, the service has been provided by multiple boats, not just one ship. The ferry is an icon in Puerto Rican culture. History The Cata√±o Ferry started operating in 1853, when the Cata√±o Steam Company used a small boat to transport cargo and passengers to San Juan. During its history, the ferry was managed by F√©rrea del Oeste and Compa√±√≠a Popular de Transporte. According to passengers, the old boat was \\"a wooden boat; they called it the turtle because it was a small boat\\". In 1960, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority acquired the franchise, building a new terminal and buying five new ships. The ferry covers only one route: from San Juan's dock to Cata√±o's ferry terminal. Since most people who used the service initiated the trip in San Juan, it became known as \\"La Lancha de Cata√±o\\", because, it is believed that people use the service mostly to travel from San Juan to Cata√±o. Despite notable decreases in its use, the service is widely known in the island, and popular with Puerto Ricans and tourists. Since the services are carried out from Old San Juan to Cata√±o and vice versa, its relative closeness to San Juan hotels made the service approachable to tourists. It is also popular with Puerto Rican and American soldiers who are based at nearby Fort Buchanan. During the 1960s,service on La lancha cost only five cents one way. The ticket prices began to rise, however; by the 1980s, it cost 25 cents, and it currently costs 50 cents (one way). Tickets are usually bought at the ferry terminals. Also during the 1980s, a famous salsa music singer filmed a well known television commercial for a beer company at one of the ferries comprising the \\"Lancha de Cata√±o\\" boat fleet. In 1988, the \\"Lancha de Cata√±o\\" service stopped being the only ship service that took people on San Juan-area trips only, when a small company introduced cruise services around Northern San Juan; these services typically lasted one hour and were carried on luxury ships, but their popularity eventually faded and the \\"Lancha de Cata√±o\\" regained its status as the only ship service taking place exclusively around the San Juan area. On January 1, 2000, the Puerto Rican Government passed ownership of all legal passenger ship services to the Puerto Rican Maritime Transport Authority. While this was made mostly to enhance service between Culebra, Fajardo and Vieques, the deal also included the \\"Lancha de Cata√±o\\" service. In 2004, slightly more than 1,100,000 passengers were transported by the \\"Lancha de Cata√±o\\" service. It is estimated that the numbers of passengers transported by the service will remain around that area for the next few years. Features Ferries used by \\"La Lancha\\"s services are two story ships, which are painted in white, with a peach and orange drawing that resembles a wave to the front. Occasionally, and under rough water conditions, passengers on the lower decks might be sprayed with water for a few seconds. No major accidents or incidents have been reported, however. Passengers who choose to ride on the boats' upper decks may stand up and hang by a fence, to look over at some touristic attractions and at ships located at the San Juan port. Round-trip services leave both Catano and San Juan's terminals every fifteen (15) minutes, and, very often, passengers on one \\"Lancha de Cata√±o\\" ship find themselves waving at passengers on another \\"Lancha de Cata√±o\\". Sometimes, the \\"Lancha de Catano\\" may take passengers on a trip around the El Morro Castle before arriving at its actual destination.

It is the oldest and most important temple of the Hokkien (Hoklo) people in the country. Another shrine at the back is Buddhist dedicated to Guanyin, the Mahayana Buddhist bodhisattva of mercy. Thian Hock Keng was gazetted as a national monument on 6 July 1973. History Late 19th/early 20th century image of Thian Hock Keng The temple originated as a small joss house first built around 1821‚Äì1822 at the waterfront serving the local Hokkien community, where seafarers and immigrants gave their thanks to the sea goddess Mazu for a safe sea passage on their arrival to Singapore. The temple is located on Telok Ayer Street and originally faced the sea; the Telok Ayer Street used to be situated along the coastline before land reclamation work began in the 1880s. Starting in 1839, the temple was rebuilt with funds collected over the years and donations from the community, the largest of which was from Tan Tock Seng, a Hokkien businessman. The building materials of the temple and a statue of Mazu was brought over from China, and the statue enshrined in the main hall of the temple in 1840. Some of the building materials, such as stone for the columns, timber as well as tiles were recycled from ballasts in ships. The local Indian community of Chulia Street also helped build the temple, and a statue of a man who appears to be an Indian holding a beam up at the ceiling was placed in the right wing as a reminder and gesture for their contribution. The temple was completed in 1842 at a cost of 30,000 Spanish dollars. In 1840, the clan association Hokkien Huay Kuan serving the Hokkien community was formed within the temple ground of Thian Hock Keng. In 1849, the Chung Wen Pagoda and Chong Boon Gate were added to the right of the main temple. The building was renovated in 1906, and some 'western-style' features were added, such as a wrought-iron gate from Glasgow and dado tiling. A scroll was presented to the temple by Guangxu Emperor to the temple in 1907. The Chong Hock Pavilion was built in 1913, and was once used by the Chong Hock Girls' School established in the temple. The temple was gazetted as a National Monument in 1973. A major renovation of the temple was initiated in 1998 and completed in 2000 at a cost of US $2.2 million. The renovation received an honourable mention from the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2001. Architecture Courtyard and front of main temple Thian Hock Keng, built on a square site, is of traditional Chinese design whereby a group of buildings or pavilions cluster around the main courtyard. It has the standard layout of three halls commonly found in such temple, with an entrance hall, a main hall, and a rear hall. The temple is constructed in the temple architecture style commonly found in Fujian. The main halls are of single-storey beam-frame structures with brackets supporting curving roofs with wide eaves. Dragons and other decorative motifs are placed on the roofs of the entrance hall as well as the main hall. Entrance hall The entrance hall has one main door and two side doors, with a high step in front. The side entrances are decorated with coloured tiles with peacocks, roses, and the Buddhist swastika motif that symbolises good luck, eternity and immortality. Guarding the doors are the traditional sentinels of Taoist temple ‚Äì stone lions and Door Gods. The temple is richly decorated with coloured tiles, red, black and gold lacquered wood, as well as figures of dragons and phoenix, with embellished and gilded beams, brackets, and ceilings. The entrance leads directly into main courtyard. Overlooking the courtyard is the temple proper where the shrine of Mazu is located. On either side of the temple are pagodas with octagonal base ‚Äì the one on the left is a shrine of Confucius while the one on the right houses the ancestral tablets of Hokkien immigrants who founded the temple. Behind the main shrine is another courtyard where a smaller altar dedicated to Kuan Yin may be found. Down either side of the temple are aisles leading to the monks quarters. Worship Altar to Mazu The main deity worshiped in the temple is Mazu (Â™ΩÁ•ñÂ©Ü, \\"Ma Cho Po\\" in the local dialect), a 10th century Fujianese shamaness deified as a Chinese sea goddess. Early immigrants to Singapore offered incense to the goddess to give thanks for a safe passage across the sea from China. Today's worshippers come to the temple to pray for peace, protection and good health. A smaller shrine to Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, is located at the back. Other deities worshiped in the temple include the God of Medicine and Health (‰øùÁîüÂ§ßÂ∏ù, Baosheng Dadi), Holy Emperor Lord Guan (ÈóúËÅñÂ∏ùÂêõ, Guansheng Dijun, worshipped for spiritual protection), the Sacred Governor Kai Zhang (ÈñãÊº≥ËÅñÁéã, Kai Zhang Sheng Wang), the Boddhisattva Sangharama (‰ºΩËóçËè©Ëñ©, Qie Lan Pu Sa) and the City God (ÂüéÈöçÁà∫, Cheng Huang Ye). Confucius is also venerated in the temple.

The first literary text from Sweden is the R√∂k runestone, carved during the Viking Age circa 800 AD. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the Middle Ages, during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore, there are only a few texts in the Old Swedish from that period. Swedish literature only flourished when the Swedish language was standardized in the 16th century, a standardization largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so-called Gustav Vasa Bible. With improved education and the freedom brought by secularisation, the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include Georg Stiernhielm (17th century), who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish; Johan Henric Kellgren (18th century), the first to write fluent Swedish prose; Carl Michael Bellman (late 18th century), the first writer of burlesque ballads; and August Strindberg (late 19th century), a socio- realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. In Sweden, the period starting in 1880 is known as realism because the writing had a strong focus on social realism. In the 1900s, one of the earliest novelists was Hjalmar S√∂derberg. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerl√∂f (Nobel laureate 1909) and P√§r Lagerkvist (Nobel laureate 1951). A well-known proletarian writer who gained fame after World War I was Vilhelm Moberg; between 1949 and 1959, he wrote the four-book series The Emigrants (Swedish: Utvandrarna), often considered one of the best literary works from Sweden. In the 1960s, Maj Sj√∂wall and Per Wahl√∂√∂ collaborated to produce a series of internationally acclaimed detective novels. The most successful writer of detective novels is Henning Mankell, whose works have been translated into 37 languages. In the spy fiction genre, the most successful writer is Jan Guillou. In recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, such as the detective novelist Henning Mankell and thriller writer Stieg Larsson. Also well known outside of Sweden is the children's book writer Astrid Lindgren, author of works such as Pippi Longstocking and Emil of Maple Hills. There is also a strong tradition of Swedish as a literary language in Finland; after the separation in the start of the 19th century, Finland has produced writers such as Johan Ludvig Runeberg, who wrote the Finnish national epic The Tales of Ensign St√•l, and Tove Jansson.  Old Norse  The R√∂k runestone, the start of Swedish literature G√∂k runestone. Most runestones had a practical, rather than a literary, purpose and are therefore mainly of interest to historians and philologists. Several runic inscriptions are also nonsensical by nature, being used for magical or incantatory purposes. The most notable literary exception is the R√∂k runestone from circa 800 AD. It contains the longest known inscription, and encompasses several different passages from sagas and legends, in various prosodic forms. Part of it is written in alliterative verse, or fornyrdislag. It is generally regarded as the beginning of Swedish literature.Gustafson, 1961 (Chapter 1)Forntid och medeltid, L√∂nnroth, in L√∂nnroth, G√∂ransson, Delblanc, Den svenska litteraturen, vol 1.  Middle Ages  The Christianization of Sweden was one of the main events in the country's history, and it naturally had an equally profound impact on literature. The G√∂k runestone is a case in point of how the older literature dissolved. It uses the same imagery as the Ramsund carving, but a Christian cross has been added and the images are combined in a way that completely distorts the internal logic of events.L√∂nnroth, L. & Delblanc, S. (1993). Den svenska litteraturen. 1, Fr√•n forntid till frihetstid : 800‚Äì1718. Stockholm : Bonnier Alba. p. 49. Whatever the reason may have been, the G√∂k stone illustrates how the pagan heroic mythos was going towards its dissolution, during the introduction of Christianity. Literature now looked to foreign texts to provide models. By 1200, Christianity was firmly established and a Medieval European culture appeared in Sweden. Only a selected few mastered the written language, but little was written down. The earliest works written in Swedish were provincial laws, first written down in the 13th century. Most education was provided by the Catholic Church, and therefore the literature from this period is mainly of a theological or clerical nature. The majority of other literature written consists of law texts. An exception to this are the rhyming chronicles, written in knittelvers.  16th and 17th century  = Reformation literature = Swedish Reformation literature is considered to have been written between 1526 and 1658. However, this period has not been highly regarded from a literary point of view. It is generally considered a step back in terms of literary development.Tigerstedt, p.68-70Algulin, p.25, also agreesGustafson, p.54, also agrees The main reason was King Gustav Vasa's wish to control and censor all publications, with the result that only the Bible and a few other religious works were published.This account is given by H√§gg (1996), p.83-84 At the same time, Catholic monasteries were plundered and Catholic books were burnt. The king did not consider it important to reestablish higher education, so Uppsala University was left to decay.This account is given in Tigerstedt (1971), p.68-70 There were comparatively few groups of writers during this time. The burghers still had little influence, while the Church clerics had had their importance severely reduced. The Protestant Reformation of the 1520s left priests with a fraction of their previous political and economic power. Those Swedes who wanted higher education usually had to travel abroad to the universities of Rostock or Wittenberg.Tigerstedt Apart from Christian Reformation literature there was one other significant ideological movement. This was Gothicismus, which glorified Sweden's ancient history. While contributions to Swedish culture were sparse, this period did at least provide an invaluable basis for future development. Most importantly, the Swedish Bible translation of 1541, the so- called Gustav Vasa Bible, gave Sweden a uniform language for the first time. Secondly, the introduction of the printing press resulted in literature being spread to groups it had previously been unable to reach. = Renaissance literature = hexametric Hercules, by Georg Stiernhielm, 1658 The period in Swedish history between 1630 and 1718 is known as the Swedish Empire. It partly corresponds to an independent literary period. The literature of the Swedish Empire era is regarded as the beginning of the Swedish literary tradition.Tigersted Renaissance literature is considered to have been written between 1658 and 1732. It was in 1658 that Georg Stiernhielm published his Herculus, the first hexametrical poem in the Swedish language. When Sweden became a great power, a stronger middle class culture arose. Unlike the age of the Reformation, education was no longer solely a matter of ecclesiastical studies such as theology. During this era, there was a wealth of influences from the leading countries of the time, namely Germany, France, Holland and Italy. It was symptomatic that the man who came to be known as Sweden's first poet, Georg Stiernhielm, was more acquainted with Ancient philosophy than with Christian teachings. Gothicismus also gained in strength. During the Swedish Empire period, it developed into a literary paradigm, the purpose of which was to foster the idea that Sweden was a natural great power.  18th century  Front page of Then Sw√§nska Argus, 1732 The 18th century has been described as the Swedish Golden Age in literature and science. During this period, Sweden produced authors and literature of a much higher standard than ever before. One key factor was the political period known as the Age of Liberty (1712‚Äì1772), and the first Swedish freedom of the press act written in 1766 (see Constitution of Sweden). It meant the ultimate breakthrough of secular literature.Gustafson, pp.102‚Äì103Warburg, p.57 (Online link) Naturally, the impulses that invigorated Swedish cultural life had their origin in the European Age of Enlightenment. The main influences came from Germany, England and France, and these were reflected in Swedish literature. The Swedish language became enriched by French words, and ideas of liberalization were based on the English model.Algulin, pp.38‚Äì39 Swedish literature consolidated around 1750; this is considered the start of a linguistic period called Late Modern Swedish (1750 ‚Äì circa 1880). The first great works of the age were those of Olov von Dalin (1708‚Äì1763), and in particular his weekly Then Sw√§nska Argus, based on Joseph Addison's The Spectator. Dalin gave a sketch of Swedish culture and history using language which had an unprecedented richness of sarcasm and irony. In the 1730s and 1740s, Dalin was unrivalled as the brightest star in the Swedish literary sky. He was the first to refine the language for practical purposes, in comparison with the laboured poetry of the 17th century, and he was the first author to be read and appreciated by the general public.Algulin, pp.39‚Äì41Gustafson, p.108 In the 18th century, Latin rapidly declined in popularity in favour of the national language. One of the first authors to aim his books directly at the general public was the world- renowned botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778). Later key figures included the poets Johan Henrik Kellgren (1751‚Äì1795) and Carl Michael Bellman (1740‚Äì1795). The 18th century were also the century when female writers first got widespread recognition. Sophia Elisabet Brenner (1659‚Äì1730), Sweden's first professional female writer, had started her career in the 17th century, but it continued into the following century.Olsson (2009), p. 94 Later, Anna Maria Lenngren's (1754‚Äì1817) often satirical writings proved to have lasting influence, and it remains a point of debate to this day how exactly to interpret \\"N√•gra ord till min k. Dotter, i fall jag hade n√•gon\\" ('A few word for my beloved daughter, if I would have had one') ‚Äì are the exhortions to remain at home and not get involved with literature or politics serious or satirical?Olsson (2009), p. 137-139  19th century  = Romanticism = Title illustration of Esaias Tegn√©r's Frithiof's Saga (1876 ed.) In European history, the period circa 1805‚Äì1840 is known as Romanticism. It also made a strong impression on Sweden, due to German influences. During this relatively short period, there were so many great Swedish poets that the era is referred to as the Golden Age of Swedish poetry.Algulin, pp.67‚Äì68Gustafson, pp.143‚Äì148 The period started around 1810 when several periodicals were published which rejected the literature of the 18th century. An important society was the Gothic Society (1811), and their periodical Iduna, a romanticised look back towards Gothicismus. One significant reason was that several poets for the first time worked towards a common direction. Four of the main romantic poets who made significant contributions to the movement were: the professor of history Erik Gustaf Geijer, the loner Erik Johan Stagnelius, the professor of Greek language Esaias Tegn√©r and the professor of aesthetics and philosophy P.D.A. Atterbom.Gustafson, p.146 = Early liberalism = The period between 1835 and 1879 is known as the early liberal period in Swedish history. The views of the Romantics had come to be perceived by many as inflated and overburdened by formality. The first outspoken liberal newspaper in Sweden, Aftonbladet, was founded in 1830. It quickly became the leading newspaper in Sweden because of its liberal views and criticism of the current state of affairs. The newspaper played its part in turning literature in a more realistic direction, because of its more concise use of language.Algulin, p.82-83Gustafson, pp.187‚Äì188 Several authorities would regard Carl Jonas Love Almqvist (1793‚Äì1866) as the most outstanding genius of the 19th century in Sweden.Algulin, p.86 Beginning in 1838, he published a series of socially and politically radical stories attacking both marriage and clerical institutions. Several of his ideas are still interesting for modern readers, in particular the work \\"Det g√•r an\\" (1839) which reached the German bestseller list as late as 2004.Translated by Anne Storm as Die Woche mit Sara (2004), ZDF page Gustafson, pp.196‚Äì200  Naturalism, or realism  The novelist and playwright August Strindberg, painted by Richard Bergh, 1906 Naturalism is one name for the literary period between 1880 and 1900. In Sweden, however, the period starting in 1880 is known as realism. This is partly because the 1880s had such a strong focus on social realism, and partly because the 1890s was a period of its own, the \\"90s poets\\".With time, however, the classification of 90s poets separate from the 1880 realism has become less prominent among scholars. A distinction between the two periods is made by Gustafson, pp.228‚Äì268 (1961) but not in Algulin, pp.109‚Äì115 (1989) In the late 19th and early 20th century, Scandinavian literature made its first and so far only impression on world literature. From Sweden, the main name was August Strindberg, but Ola Hansson, Selma Lagerl√∂f and Victoria Benedictsson also attained wider recognition.Algulin, p.109 The breakthrough of realism in Sweden occurred in 1879. That year, August Strindberg (1845‚Äì1912) published The Red Room (R√∂da Rummet), a satirical novel that relentlessly attacked the political, the academic, the philosophical and the religious worlds.Algulin pp.115‚Äì132Gustafson, pp.238‚Äì257 August Strindberg was a writer world-famous for his dramas and prose, noted for his exceptional talent and complex intellect. He would continue to write several books and dramas until his death in Stockholm.Algulin pp.115‚Äì132Gustafson, pp.238‚Äì257 He also was an accomplished painter and photographer. = The 90s poets = The Swedish 1890s is noted for its poetic neo-romanticism, a reaction to the socio-realistic literature of the 1880s. The first key literary figure to emerge was Verner von Heidenstam (1859‚Äì1940); his literary debut came in 1887 with the collection of poetry Vallfart och vandrings√•r (Pilgrimage and Wander- Years).Algulin, pp.137‚Äì140Gustafson, vol2, p.11 A few years later, Gustav Fr√∂ding made his debut. While controversial in his own time, Fr√∂ding has proven to be Sweden's most popular poet.Olsson (2009), p 300 The poetry of Erik Axel Karlfeldt was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1931. The novelist Selma Lagerl√∂f (1858‚Äì1940) was arguably the brightest star of the 1890s, and her influence has lasted up to modern times. Two of her major works, which have been translated into several languages, are The Wonderful Adventures of Nils (1906‚Äì1907) and G√∂sta Berlings saga (1891), but she also wrote several other highly regarded books. Lagerl√∂f was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909, mainly for her storytelling abilities.The Nobel Prize in Literature 1909, The Official Web Site of the Nobel Foundation, 15 October 2006Algulin, pp.158‚Äì160  20th century  = Modernism = Hjalmar S√∂derberg It was in the 1910s that a new literary period began with the ageing August Strindberg, who published several critical articles, contesting many conservative values. With the advent of social democracy and large-scale strikes, the winds were blowing in the direction of social reforms.Gustafson, vol. 2, p. 12Gustafson, vol. 2, pp.7‚Äì16 = The modern novel = In the 1910s, the dominant form of literary expression was now the novel. One of the earliest novelists was Hjalmar S√∂derberg (1869‚Äì1941). S√∂derberg wrote in a somewhat cynical way, at times with Nietzschean overtones, disillusionment and pessimism. In 1901 he published Martin Birck's Youth. It was appreciated by many for its literary qualities, but an even greater aspect was its depiction of Stockholm, which is widely regarded as the best portrait of Stockholm ever written.As told by Gustafson, vol 2 (1961) His most highly regarded work was yet to come however: Doctor Glas (1905), a tale of vengeance and passion, viewed by some as the best and most complete of all Swedish novels.As reported by Algulin, p.169 (1989) Margaret Atwood, for example, has said of Doctor Glas: \\"It occurs on the cusp of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, but it opens doors the novel has been opening ever since\\".From her introduction to the translation by Paul Britten Austin, Harvill Press Edition, 2002, .  Proletarian literature  Moa Martinson in 1957. Swedish agriculture had a system with labourers called statare, who were paid in kind only, with product and housing, comparable with the Anglo-Saxon truck system. Among the few people with this background who made an intellectual career were the writers Ivar Lo-Johansson, Moa Martinson and Jan Frideg√•rd. Their works were important to the abolition of the system. Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson developed the Swedish autobiograpichal novel with works such as Johnson's novel series Romanen om Olof (1934‚Äì1937) and Martinson's Flowering Nettles (1935). In 1974 they shared the Nobel Prize in Literature. A well- known proletarian writer was Vilhelm Moberg (1898‚Äì1973). He usually wrote about the lives of ordinary people and in particular the peasant population. Moberg's monumental work was published shortly after the Second World War: the four-volume The Emigrants series (1949‚Äì1959), about the Swedish emigration to North America. In this work, Moberg sentimentally depicted a 19th-century couple during their move to the New World; and the many struggles and difficulties they had to endure.Algulin, pp.191‚Äì194  Late 20th century  Sara Lidman, a celebrated novelist of the 1950s turned to political writing in the 1960s, but later returned to writing novels centred on life in a small village in northern Sweden. Authors such as Per Olof Sundman and Per Olov Enquist turned to pseudo-documentary novels. Enquist later had international success with the historical novel Livl√§karens bes√∂k (1999, The Visit of the Royal Physician). Lars Gustafsson, best known for his partially autobiographical novel series Sprickorna i muren (1971‚Äì78; \\"The Cracks in the Wall\\"), railed against the bureaucratic Swedish welfare state in multilayered, often metafictional novels. Sven Delblanc wrote a series of four acclaimed historical novels about his childhood region, depicting the rural Swedish society in an unidealized way. G√∂ran Tunstr√∂m's novels marked a return of the joy of storytelling after the political themes. His novels, rich of fantasy and humour and set in his home region V√§rmland, reached a highpoint with Juloratoriet (1983; The Christmas Oratorio). Torgny Lindgren is one of the internationally most successful Swedish writers. His novels, set in the remote countryside of northern Sweden often deals with questions of power, oppression, and the nature of evil, such as Ormens v√§g p√• h√§lleberget (1982; The Way of a Serpent). Another leading novelist of the 1970s to the 1990s was Kerstin Ekman.Den svenska litteraturen 3 Fr√•n modernism till massmedial marknad : 1920‚Äì1995 / redaktion: Lars L√∂nnroth, Sven Delblanc, Sverker G√∂ransson. = Poetry = Tomas Transtr√∂mer, 2014. In the 1930s and 1940s, poetry was influenced by the ideals of modernism. Distinguishing features included the desire to experiment, and to try a variety of styles, usually free verse without rhyme or metre. The leading modernist figure soon turned out to be Hjalmar Gullberg (1898‚Äì1961). He wrote many mystical and Christian- influenced collections, such as Andliga √∂vningar (Spiritual Exercises, 1932) and others. After a poetical break 1942‚Äì1952, he resurfaced with a new style in the 1950s. Atheistic on the surface, it was influential for the younger generation.Tigerstedt (1975), pp. 474‚Äì476H√§gg (1996), pp.481‚Äì484 Gunnar Ekel√∂f (1907‚Äì1968) has been described as Sweden's first surrealistic poet, due to his first poetry collection, the nihilistic Sent p√• jorden (1932), a work hardly understood by his contemporaries.Lundkvist, Martinsson, Ekel√∂f, by Espmark & Olsson, in Delblanc, L√∂nnroth, G√∂ransson, vol 3 But Ekel√∂f moved towards romanticism and with his second poetry collection Dedikationen in 1934 he became appreciated in wider circles. He continued to write until his old age, and was to attain a dominant position in Swedish poetry. His style has been described as heavy with symbolism and enigmatic, while at the same time tormented and ironical.H√§gg (1996), pp. 528‚Äì524 Another important modernist poet was Harry Martinson (1904‚Äì1978). Harry Martinson had an unparalleled feeling for nature, in the spirit of Linnaeus. As was typical for his generation, he wrote free verse, not bound by rhyme or syllable-count. He also wrote novels, a classic work being the partly autobiographical Flowering Nettles, in 1935. His most remarkable work was, however, Aniara, 1956, a story of a spaceship drifting through space.Algulin, p.230-231 Arguably the most famous Swedish poet of the 20th century is Tomas Transtr√∂mer (1931‚Äì2015). His poetry is distinguished by a Christian mysticism, moving on the verge between dream and reality, the physical and the metaphysical.Poeten dold i Bilden, Lilja & Schi√∂ler, in L√∂nnroth, Delblanc & G√∂ransson (ed.), vol 3, pp.342‚Äì370 At the same time there in the Sixties developed a strong tradition influenced by the historical avant-garde, and the Swedish movement of concrete poetry became one of the three global representants for experimental poetry at this time, with representatives like √ñyvind Fahlstr√∂m (who seemingly published the first manifesto for concrete poetry in the world 1954: \\"H√§tila ragulpr p√• f√•tskliaben\\"),A title taken from Winnie the Pooh, which in English reads \\"Hipy papy bthuthdththuthda bthuthdy\\". √ñyvind Fahlstr√∂m, \\"H√ÑTILA RAGULPR P√Ö F√ÖTSKLIABEN\\", Odyss√© no. 2/3 1954. √Öke Hodell, Bengt Emil Johnson, and Leif Nyl√©n. In a reaction against the experimental Sixties one in the Seventies took up the beat-tradition from the US, in a continued avant-garde effort which resulted in little magazines publishing poetry, a stencil movement out of which one of Swedish main poets of today ‚Äì Bruno K. √ñijer ‚Äì grow, and developed a lyrical performance with inspiration from Antonin Artaud's \\"Theatre of cruelty\\", rock'n'roll and the avant-garde performance.Per B√§ckstr√∂m, Aska, Tomhet & Eld. Outsiderproblematiken hos Bruno K. √ñijer, (diss.) Lund: Ellerstr√∂ms f√∂rlag, 2003. Dan Andersson (born 6 April 1888 in Skattl√∂sberg, Grang√§rde parish (in present-day Ludvika Municipality), Dalarna, Sweden, died 16 September 1920 in Stockholm) was a Swedish author and poet. He also set some of his own poems to music. Andersson married primary school teacher Olga Turesson, the sister of artist Gunnar Turesson, in 1918. A nom de plume he sometimes used was Black Jim. Andersson is counted among the Swedish proletarian authors, but his works are not limited to that genre. = Drama = Several writers of drama surfaced after World War II. In the 1950s, revues were popular; some names of the era were the comedians Povel Ramel and Kar de Mumma. The Hasse & Tage duo continued the comedic tradition in 1962 and became something of an institution in the Swedish revue world for twenty years, encompassing radio, television and film productions. With the late 1960s came a breakthrough for alternative drama of a freer nature, and theatre became more of a venue for popular tastes. In the 1970s and 1980s, the two most noted playwrights were Lars Nor√©n (1944‚Äì) and Per Olov Enquist (1934‚Äì2020).Fr√•n hovteater till arbetarspel, Forser & TJ√§der, in Delblanc, G√∂ransson & L√∂nnroth, Den svenska litteraturen, vol 3. = Children's literature = In the 1930s a new awareness of children's needs emerged. This manifested itself shortly after World War II, when Astrid Lindgren published Pippi Longstocking in 1945. Pippi's rebellious behaviour at first sparked resistance among some defenders of cultural values, but eventually she was accepted, and with that children's literature was freed from the obligation to promote moralism.Svensson, S., S√• skulle v√§rlden bli som ny, in L√∂nnroth, Delblanc & G√∂ransson (ed.), Den svenska litteraturen, vol. 3. (1999)More information about Pippi Longstocking in Swedish culture can be found in the article Pippi Longstocking: Swedish rebel and feminist role model from the Swedish Institute. Retrieved 28 July 2009. Astrid Lindgren continued to publish many best-selling children's books which eventually made her the most read Swedish author, regardless of genre, with over 100 million copies printed throughout the world and translations into over 80 languages. In many other books Lindgren showed her fine understanding of children's thought and values; in The Brothers Lionheart about death, as well as a tale of bravery; in Mio, My Son, a fairy tale about friendship. But not all her stories had deep messages. Three books on Karlsson-on-the-Roof (1955, '62, '68) are about a short, chubby and mischievous man with a propeller on his back, who is befriended by a boy. Lindgren wrote twelve books about Emil of Maple Hills, a boy living in the Sm√•land countryside in the early 1900s, who continuously gets intro trouble because of his pranks, yet in later life becomes a responsible and resourceful man, and the Chairman of the Municipality Council. One of few fantasy writers in Swedish literature apart from Lindgren was the Finnish writer Tove Jansson (1914‚Äì2001), who wrote, in the Swedish language, about the Moomins. The Moomins are trolls who live in an economically and politically independent state, without any materialistic concerns. The Moomins have appealed to people in many different countries and Jansson's books have been translated into over 30 languages.Tampere Art Museum website. Retrieved 20 October 2006. = Detective novels = Before World War II, the Swedish detective novel was based on British and American models. After World War II, it developed in an independent direction. In the 1960s, Maj Sj√∂wall (1935‚Äì2020) and Per Wahl√∂√∂ (1926‚Äì1975) collaborated to produce a series of internationally acclaimed detective novels about the detective Martin Beck. Other writers followed. The most successful writer of Swedish detective novels is Henning Mankell (1948‚Äì2015), with his series on Kurt Wallander. They have been translated to 37 languages and have become bestsellers, particularly in Sweden and Germany.On the trail of Sweden‚Äôs most famous detective , Swedish Institute. Retrieved 17 October 2006. Mankell's detective stories have been widely praised for their sociological themes, examining the effects on a liberal culture of immigration, racism, neo-Nazism etc. Many of the stories have been filmed no less than three times, twice by Swedish companies and most recently in an English-language series starring Kenneth Branagh. But Mankell has also written several other acclaimed books, such as Com√©dia Infantil (1995), about an abandoned street boy in the city of Maputo.Chapter \\"Det popul√§ra kretsloppet\\", Hedman, L√∂nnroth & Ingvarsson, in L√∂nnroth, Delblanc & G√∂ransson (ed.), vol 3. Several other Swedish detective writers have become popular abroad, particularly in Germany; for example Liza Marklund (1962‚Äì), H√•kan Nesser (1950‚Äì), √Ösa Larsson, Arne Dahl, Leif G. W. Persson, Johan Theorin, Camilla L√§ckberg, Mari Jungstedt and √Öke Edwardson. From 2004 and onwards, the deceased Stieg Larsson caused an international sensation with the Millennium Trilogy, continuing as a series with new novels being written by David Lagercrantz. In the spy fiction genre, the most successful writer is Jan Guillou (1944‚Äì) and his best-selling books about the spy Carl Hamilton, many of which have also been filmed. Of Guillou's other works, the two most notable are his series on the Knight Templar Arn Magnusson and the semi- autobiographical novel with the metaphorical title Ondskan (The Evil). = Ballads = The Swedish ballad tradition had been initiated by Bellman in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, poetic songwriting fell into decline with the rise of university student choirs, until it was again revived in the 1890s. Poets increasingly continued the tradition of having their poetry set to music to give it a wider audience. In the early 1900s, a lot of poetry of the 90s poets Gustaf Fr√∂ding and Erik Axel Karlfeldt had been put to music. Arguably the most renowned Swedish troubadour of the 20th century was however Evert Taube (1890‚Äì1976). He established himself as a performing artist in 1920 and toured Sweden for about three decades. He is best known for songs about sailors, ballads about Argentina, and songs about the Swedish countryside.N√∂jets estrad√∂rer, L√∂nnroth L., in L√∂nnroth, Delblanc & G√∂ransson (ed.), vol 3, pp.275‚Äì297 Between 1962 up until his death, the most highly regarded singer-songwriter in the Swedish ballad tradition was Dutch immigrant Cornelis Vreeswijk (1937‚Äì1987). Some of his songs were leftist protest songs where he took it upon himself to speak for society's underdogs but he himself hated to be called a protest singer. His musical universe was much broader and he was for instance heavily influenced by the rich Swedish literature. After his death, Vreeswijk also gained appreciation for his poetic qualities. = Literature in pop music lyrics = This literary period began in Sweden in the 1960s, influenced by artists from England and the U.S. At first, the literary quality in Swedish pop music was little more than an imitation of foreign models, and it took until the 1970s for an independent movement to emerge. In that decade, youth grassroots music reached unprecedented popularity, and opened the possibility for unestablished artists to have their music published. Because of the common political message these bands often presented, they are classified as Progg (short for \\"progressive\\"). While few Progg-artists actually produced anything worthwhile, there were some acts who stood out. Nationalteatern were significant because they were not only a musical group, but also theatre performers; and in the talented leftist artist Mikael Wiehe (1946‚Äì) of Hoola Bandoola Band, there was a renewal of Swedish ballad writing, in the direction of high quality proletarian lyrics. One of the rebels of the 1970s was Ulf Lundell (1949‚Äì) who abandoned the grass root movement for rock 'n roll. In 1976, he broke through in literature with his debut novel Jack, a beatnik novel that came to represent a whole generation. While critics were not impressed, the novel sold in great numbers and is still appreciated by many. = Finland = The Swedish language is an official language in Finland, with approximately 5.6% of the population having it as their mother tongue. Hence Swedish language literature has a considerable following in Finland, with several well-known Swedish-speaking Finnish writers, such as Bo Carpelan, Christer Kihlman and Tove Jansson. Jansson, perhaps best known for her Moomin books for children, wrote novels and short stories for adults, including Sommarboken, (1972, The Summer Book). A cultural body representing such literature is the Society of Swedish Literature in Finland, which describes itself as \\"a versatile and future-oriented cultural institution of Finland-Swedish literature, culture and research.\\" The Society is also a leading investor in the global equity and debt markets and a staunch defender of Finnish national interests, most recently against incursions by Swedish investors. This stance has caused some disquiet among Society members committed to the project of pan-Nordic literary appreciation.

It is committed to a balance among humanistic, scientific, and professional orientations, and to an emphasis on integrating research experience into undergraduate education. The Dietrich College General Education Program combines required courses that teach key analytical skills with a wide range of elective courses to develop foundational skills essential to effective learning throughout the college career and beyond. About the Dietrich College The College of Humanities and Social Sciences admitted its first freshman class in 1969, following the announcement of the pending closure of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, although roots of the college can be traced to the Division of Applied Psychology, founded in 1915 and led by Walter Van Dyke Bingham and Walter Dill Scott as the first research-oriented department within Carnegie Mellon. The administrative offices of the Dietrich College are located in Baker Hall. Most of the classes offered by the Dietrich College are held in Baker Hall and Porter Hall, but some classes, particularly the smaller recitation classes, are held in various locations throughout the campus. All undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon are required to take several Dietrich classes (at least two, but usually more) as part of their program's General Education requirements. Dietrich College's general education program has been called \\"the most creative general education program of any American university\\" by The New York Times. The founding Dean of the Dietrich College was Erwin Steinberg. Past deans include John Patrick Crecine, Stephen Fienberg, Joel A. Tarr, Peter Stearns, and John P. Lehoczky. The current Dean is Professor of Philosophy Richard Scheines, who began his term on July 1, 2014. In December, 2014, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded the Dietrich College a $2 million grant to develop training in digital humanities for PhD students in the departments of English, History, Philosophy, and Modern Languages. On September 7, 2011, William S. Dietrich II, the former chairman of Dietrich Industries, Inc., a subsidiary of Worthington Industries, Inc., pledged a gift of $265 million. In response to this gift, Carnegie Mellon renamed the College of Humanities and Social Sciences to the Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences after William Dietrich's mother.

Before the 2019 season, it was known as the disabled list (DL). General guidelines Players are placed on either the 10-day (for position players; prior to the 2017 season, 15-day), 15-day (for pitchers and two-way players, effective as of the 2020 season), or the 60-day injured list, usually depending on the severity and/or recovery time of the injury. Placing a player on the injured list opens a spot on the active roster. Another player from the minor leagues, free agent pool, a traded player, or a recovered player coming off the injured list may be used to fill this spot. This allows a team to avoid the disadvantage of playing with an incapacitated player on the bench. The player may not rejoin the active roster until the minimum 10, 15, or 60 days has elapsed; however, a player's time on the injured list may exceed the specified number of days, and, further, if a player is transferred to the 60-day injured list after August 1, he may not return to the active roster that season. The 10- and 15-day injured lists do not count the player on the active roster (comprising the 26-man roster until September 1, and the 28-man roster after September 1), whereas the 60-day injured list does not require the player to be counted on either the team's active roster or its 40-man roster; however, a team's 40-man roster must be full in order for the option of a placement on the 60-day injured list to be available.\\"MLB Miscellany: Rules, regulations and statistics\\" MLB.com A player may be shifted from the 10- or 15-day injured list to the 60-day injured list at any time, but not vice versa. The rule about rejoining the active roster only applies to eligibility to play in a game. Players are permitted to stay with the team and attend games, though players may leave the team to focus on treatment, to avoid traveling with the team on a road trip, and/or for short term minor league rehabilitation assignments to prepare for their return to the active roster. Alternatively, a team may elect to keep a slightly injured player on the roster but list him as 'day-to-day' to indicate that the medical staff is unable to determine when the player can resume full playing activities. If the injury turns out to be minor, then the player may resume playing immediately without having to serve the minimum term on the injured list; however, depending upon the circumstances, the team may find itself effectively shorthanded in the meantime. This also allows a valuable, slightly injured player to continue to contribute in a limited role, such as pinch hitting. Retroactive placement on the IL may be made at most 10 days after the last time the affected player played in a game. This allows a club to defer the decision to place a player on the injured list until more information can be learned about the extent and impact of the injury. =Concussion list= Starting with the 2011 season, Major League Baseball instituted a new, shorter injured list: a 7-day list specifically for concussions. The idea is to prevent long-term brain damage which may take up to 7 days by current standards,MLB institutes 7-day injured list for concussions ESPN without having to serve the 10- or 15-day minimum on the regular IL. If a player is not activated from the concussion injured list after 10 days (position players) or 15 days (pitchers and two-way players) have passed, he is automatically transferred to the 10- or 15-day injured list as applicable. =Paternity list= Also in 2011, Major League Baseball instituted a paternity list. This allows a team to replace a player who is an expectant father for 1‚Äì3 days on the roster to be available for the birth of his child.Bay returns, appreciative of paternity leave MLB.com =Bereavement list= A player may be placed on the bereavement list upon attending to a seriously ill member in the player's immediate family or to a death in the family. The bereavement list may span from a minimum of three to a maximum of seven games. Umpiring's bereavement list for death in the immediate family may span up to a full season. =Minor League Baseball= Minor League Baseball uses a seven-day injured list for all injuries. Players who are on the 40-man roster but get hurt in the minor leagues are placed on the minor league IL, but not on the major league IL. One problem this poses is that a player who is injured in the minors and who would be placed on the major league 60-day IL cannot be placed on the 60-day, meaning the 40-man roster spot is not freed up. A free roster spot on an MLB club can be strategically valuable, leading to occasional creative use of injured lists by MLB teams and their minor league affiliates (similar to teams strategically appealing or dropping an appeal of a disciplinary suspension, in order align the timing of the sentence to optimize player contribution). Poor performing, slightly injured players might be put on the IL to be assigned to the minors for rehab, when the MLB club might really want them reassigned primarily because of performance, but might not otherwise be able to reassign them due to service time, lack of options, contract stipulations, etc. The Collective Bargaining Agreement between the players and the league contains rules against blatantly \\"gaming the system.\\" Players recovering from an injury may appear in a limited number of minor league games while still on the injured list in order to prepare for reactivation. Pitchers may play on a minor league club for up to 30 days; others for up to 20 days.\\"Transactions Primer\\" History The term \\"disabled list\\" was used as far back as 1887, and was common terminology in MLB for over 100 years until being changed to the current \\"injured list\\" prior to the 2019 season. The name was changed after MLB was requested to do so by disability advocates, and also allows the term to be consistent with other professional sports that use an \\"injured reserve list\\". Players on the \\"injured list\\" are not necessarily injured, some being ill or disabled from playing for other reasons.\\"Mets place Noah Syndergaard on the disabled list with hand, foot and mouth disease\\" by Justin Tasch. The New York Daily News, JUL 22, 2018 The categories and variety of disabled lists have changed numerous times over the years. The 15-day disabled list was introduced in 1966, joining 10-day, 21-day and 30-day options, and the 60-day disabled list in 1990. Prior to 1990, the number of players who could be placed on each list was limited, players with major league contracts were not allowed to go to the minor leagues for rehabilitation, and there was less flexibility about when they could return to action. The 10-day disabled list was dropped in 1984 but restored for the 2017 season (replacing the 15-day option), and the 21-day and 30-day options were dropped in 1990 with the introduction of the 60-day disabled list.

The story was reprinted by a number of newspapers. In 1939, an urban legend began when Denver songwriter Harry Lee Wilber claimed in a magazine article that the 1899 hoax had ignited the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. The radio commentators Paul Harvey and Dwight Sands perpetuated the legend. Variations have been incorporated into sermons about \\"the power of the tongue,\\" a morality tale used by preachers to highlight the consequences of lying. In fact, however, there was never any such connection and Boxer activity intensified in response to the German invasion in Shandong during March 1899 ‚Äì before the hoax was invented. No Chinese history reference relates the hoax to the Boxer Rebellion. The cultural historian Carlos Rojas comments that the original hoax being perpetuated by a second hoax, a \\"metahoax,\\" illustrates the ability of the Great Wall to \\"mean radically different things in different contexts.\\" Background The hoax was created at the height of imperialism during late 19th Century. In 1898, Britain obtained a 99-year lease for the New Territories, extending the Hong Kong colony that had been ceded in 1841. Britain also sent a fleet into the Gulf of Chihli and forced the Chinese to lease Weihaiwei. Germany seized the Chinese port of Kiaochow and used it for a military base. The French leased Kouang- Tch√©ou-Wan from China. Also, in the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan defeated China. Xenophobia in China was widespread. Beginning The hoax began with four Denver newspaper reporters, Al Stevens, Jack Tournay, John Lewis, and Hal Wilshire, who represented the four Denver newspapers‚Äîthe Post, the Republican, the Times, and the Rocky Mountain News. The four met by chance at Denver Union Station where each were waiting in hopes of spotting someone of prominence who could become a subject for a news story. Seeing no celebrities and frustrated with no story in sight and deadlines due, Stevens remarked, \\"I don't know what you guys are going to do, but I'm going to fake it. It won't hurt anybody, so what the Devil.\\" The other three men agreed to concoct a story and walked on 17th Street toward the Oxford Hotel to discuss possible ideas. Some stories, such as New York detectives tracking kidnappers of a rich heiress or the creation of a powerful company that would compete with the equally powerful Colorado Fuel and Iron Company were ruled out, as stories set in the United States were more likely to be checked and verified. The reporters then began running through countries such as Germany, Russia, and Japan until one of the reporters suggested China. John Lewis grew excited and exclaimed, \\"That's it, the Great Wall of China! Must be 50 years since that old pile's been in the news. Let's build our story around it. Let's do the Chinese a real favor. Let's tear the old pile down!\\" The four reporters concocted a story in which the Chinese planned to demolish the Great Wall, constructing a road in its place, and were taking bids from American companies for the project. Chicago engineer Frank C. Lewis was bidding for the job. The story described a group of engineers in a Denver stopover on their way to China. Although one of the reporters worried about the consequences of such an invented story, he was eventually overruled by the other reporters. Leaving the Oxford Bar, they went to the Windsor Hotel, signed four fictitious names to the register and told the desk clerk to say to anyone who asked that reporters had interviewed four men before they left for California. The reporters swore they would stick to this story as fact as long as any of the others were still alive. The next day, all four major Denver newspapers, the Times, Post, Republican, and Rocky Mountain News featured the fabricated tale on their front pages. In the Times, as well as the other three papers, this was a typical headline: Although the Denver papers dropped the story after a few days, the story did not die. Two weeks after the Denver headlines, John Lewis noticed that a large Eastern U.S. newspaper had picked up the story and included information not even in the original story. This newspaper included quotes from a Chinese mandarin confirming the story, with illustrations and comments about the tearing down of the wall. Eventually the story spread to newspapers all across the country and then into Europe. Although the story developed into different versions, the essence remained: Americans were going to China to tear down the Great Wall. 10 years later, the last surviving reporter of the hoax, Hal Wilshire, confessed the secret. Harry Lee Wilber The 1899 hoax which began at the Denver train station was expanded in 1939 by Denver songwriter Harry Lee Wilber. The alleged Boxer Rebellion connection originated many years later with Denver songwriter Harry Lee Wilber (1875‚Äì1946). Wilber embellished the original tale when he wrote an article \\"A Fake That Rocked the World,\\" for the North American Review in 1939. Wilber's article claimed that when the \\"pure canard\\" reached China, the newspapers there published it with \\"shouting headlines\\" and the Boxers, \\"already incensed, believed the yarn\\" and \\"all hell broke loose.\\" Wilber's article was reprinted 17 years later in Great Hoaxes of All Time (1956), edited by Robert Medill McBride and Neil Pritchie.McBride, Robert Medill and Pritchie, Neil, ed. Great Hoaxes of All Time. pp. 17‚Äì24. New York: Robert M. McBride Co., 1956. Wilber, who composed the music for \\"Back to Dear Old Denver Town\\" (1912), was the first manager of the Fox Fullerton Theater (Fullerton, California) after it was constructed in 1924‚Äì25. The legend was also told in More of Paul Harvey's The Rest of the Story (1981).Wilber, Harry Lee. \\"A Fake That Rocked the World,\\" North American Review, 1939.

He was the brother of writers Arthur Hamilton Gibbs, Francis William Hamilton Gibbs, Helen Katherine Hamilton Gibbs and Sir Philip Gibbs. Biography Hamilton was born in Norwood. He took his mother's maiden name when he began to write. Hamilton was married twice: first to Beryl Faber, n√©e Crossley Smith, who died in 1912. (She was the sister of actor C. Aubrey Smith.) Hamilton then married Julia Bolton, the former wife of playwright Guy Bolton. His London musicals include The Catch of the Season (1904), The Belle of Mayfair (1906), The Beauty of Bath (1906). During the First World War Hamilton was a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Service. He later wrote a number of Broadway shows and many screenplays, and his novels were the basis for several films. In her April 1922 theater column, Dorothy Parker's review of Hamilton's Broadway play Danger remarked on the salacious content of Hamilton's plays: \\"There can longer be any doubt that it was from Cosmo Hamilton that the cosmic urge derived its name. Not even his own press agent could claim for Mr. Hamilton that it was he who conceived the notion of sex, but certainly he has given most of his life to capitalizing the idea. It has often been observed that if there were no such thing as sex, everything would be a lot better off.

It established a cease-fire line which has been monitored by United Nations observers from the United Nations since then. Background The Security Council Resolution 39 of April 1948 established a UN Commission (United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan ‚Äî UNCIP) to mediate between India and Pakistan in order to bring about a cessation of fighting in Kashmir and to make arrangements for a popular plebiscite. After negotiations with the two sides, the Commission passed a three-part resolution in August 1948 and subsequently added a 'supplement'. The three parts dealt with ceasefire, terms for truce, and procedures for negotiation regarding the plebiscite. Both the countries accepted the resolution and a ceasefire was achieved on 31 December 1948. Agreement The princely state of Jammu and Kashmir with the current Line of Control defined in 1972 (similar to that of 1949) The Karachi Agreement, formally called the Agreement Between Military Representatives of India and Pakistan Regarding the Establishment of a Cease- Fire Line in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, was signed on 27 July 1949, supervised by the Truce Subcommittee of the UNCIP. The signatories were: # Lt. Gen. S. M. Shrinagesh, on behalf of India # Maj. Gen. W. J. Cawthorn, on behalf of Pakistan # Hernando Samper and M. Delvoie, on behalf of the UNCIP. The other members of the Indian delegation were Maj. Gen. K. S. Thimayya, Brig. Sam Maneckshaw, Maj. S. K. Sinha (who acted as the aide-de-camp for Gen. Srinagesh), and the secretaries of the Defence Ministry and the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs. The Pakistani delegation included Maj. Gen. Nazir Ahmed and Brig. Sher Khan and civil servants M. Ayub and A. A. Khan. The military representatives of the two sides negotiated for a week starting 18 July to demarcate the positions under their control. S. K. Sinha stated that the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru briefed the Indian delegation before the Karachi meeting, wherein he informed them that the UN Resolution conceded the legality of Kashmir's accession to India and, so, any \\"no man's land\\" would belong to India. The Pakistani delegation would need to produce proof to the UN Commission of factual positions of their control for all the territory they claim. Sinha stated that, based on this principle, the agreement demarcated several hundred square miles of territory on the Indian side even though there were no Indian troops in that territory.Claude Arpi, The myths of wild roses and Pakistani presence in Siachen, Daily News and Analysis, 28 May 2012. The ceasefire line of 1949 The 830 kilometre long ceasefire line established in the agreement started from a southernmost point just west of the Chenab river in Jammu. It ran in a rough arc northwards and then northeastwards to the map coordinate NJ9842, about 19 km north of the Shyok river. From the map point NJ9842 it was said to run due north to the international boundary with China, at a distance of about 60‚Äì65 km. Since there were no troops in that area of inaccessible glacial terrain, no effort was made to extend the ceasefire line between NJ9842 and the China border. This area, of the Siachen Glacier, eventually became a bone of contention between India and Pakistan. Another anomaly arose at the southern end of the ceasefire line in Jammu. From the terminus of the ceasefire line to the international boundary between Indian and Pakistani Punjab, there was a gap of over 200 km, which was covered by a recognised \\"provincial boundary\\" between Pakistani Punjab and the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. India generally referred to this boundary as the \\"international border\\", whereas Pakistan referred to it as the \\"border\\" or the \\"working border\\".

These observers, under the command of the Military Advisor, formed the nucleus of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). On 30 March 1951, following the termination of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), the Security Council, by Resolution 91 (1951) decided that UNMOGIP should continue to supervise the cease-fire line in Kashmir.

In December 2011, a follow-up observation by Warner gave a period of 3.0661 hours with 0.18 amplitude (). Due to a couple of supposed occultation and eclipsing events, Warner also suspects that Engelhardt might by a binary system with a minor- planet moon orbiting it every 36.03 hours. The result, however, is far from conclusive. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Engelhardt measures between 7.34 and 9.16 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between and 0.231 and 0.37.

He appears in the Orkneyinga saga and briefly in St Olaf's Saga, as incorporated into the Heimskringla. These stories were first written down in Iceland in the early 13th century and much of the information they contain is \\"hard to corroborate\\".Woolf (2007) p. 242 Family Thorfinn was the youngest son of Torf-Einarr, himself the son of Rognvald Eysteinsson, the first Earl of Orkney. Torf-Einarr had two other sons, Arnkel and Erlend who \\"fell in a war expedition\\"Sturlason, Snorri Chapter 99. \\"History of the Earls of Orkney\\". at an unspecified location in England along with Erik Bloodaxe.Orkneyinga Saga (1981) Chapter 8. p. 33 Erik's widow, Gunnhildr then fled north to Orkney with her sons who used the islands as a base for summer raiding expeditions. Hoxa broch (at left), Earl Thorfinn's supposed burial place Thorfinn had five sons: Arnfinn, Havard, Hlodvir, Ljot, and Skuli. Their mother was Grelad, a daughter of \\"Earl Dungad of Caithness\\" and Groa, herself a daughter of Thorstein the Red. Grelad's Norse credentials were thus impressive, but it has been suggested that her connection to this \\"earl\\" of Caithness may have been more important for the Orkney earldom. It is likely that Dungad was a member of a pre-Norse era ruling family and that the marriage brought Groa's descendants within the Celtic derbfine and helped to legitimise their ambitions on the north mainland of Scotland. Thorfinn and Grelod also had two daughters whose names are not known,Crawford (1987) p. 54 each of whom had a son called Einar - Einar kliningr (\\"Buttered-bread\\") and Einar har√∞kjotr (\\"Hard-mouth\\"). Gunnhildr and her family later set out for Norway, but before they left they \\"gave\\" their daughter Ragnhild Eriksdotter to Arnfinn Thorfinnsson in marriage. In the later days of Thorfinn's rule, the sons of Eric Bloodaxe fled Norway and returned to Orkney where they \\"committed great excesses\\". Death and legacy Thorfinn Torf-Einarsson lived to be an old man and may have died c. 963 \\"on a bed of sickness\\". He is said to have been buried at the broch site at Howe of Hoxa on South Ronaldsay.Wenham (2003) p. 211-12 According to St Olaf's Saga his sons became Earls after him but the earldom was then beset by dynastic strife. Ragnhild had her husband Arnfinn killed at Murkle in Caithness and married his brother Havard \\"Harvest-happy\\"Thomson (2008) pp. 58-59 who then ruled as earl for a time. Not content with this new arrangement Ragnhild then conspired with her nephew Einar kliningr, who killed Havard at the battle of Havar√∞steiger near Stenness. Einar and Ragnhild then fell out and the latter persuaded Einar har√∞kjotr to attack and kill his cousin Einar kliningr in turn. Ragnhild's ambitions were still not assuaged and this \\"female spider\\" then colluded with Ljot Thorfinnson whom she married and then he had the second Einar killed. Having now married three of Thorfinn's sons in succession no more is told of Ragnhild and Ljot became earl and an \\"excellent leader\\".Orkneyinga Saga (1981) Chapters 9, 10 & 11\\\\. pp. 35-36 The old watermill and mill pond at Ham, Caithness Skuli gave allegiance to the Scots king who gave him the title Earl of Orkney but he never gained control of the islands, being killed in battle against Ljot in the Dales of Caithness at which Ljot \\"fought like a hero\\". Ljot then took control of Caithness but this angered the Scots and MacBeth, the Mormaer of Moray, brought a large army north. They engaged in battle at Skitten Mire (now called the Moss of Killimister) near WickMuir (2005) p. 21 and although outnumbered Ljot had the victory. However he later died of wounds suffered there and \\"people thought it a great loss\\". Hlodvir then became earl and \\"ruled alone over this country\\". Hlodvir ruled well and married Eithne, daughter of Kjarvalr, King of Ireland. Hlodvir died in his bed and was buried at Ham in Caithness. He was succeeded as earl by his son Sigurd. The modern Orcadian beer Skull Splitter is named after Thorfinn.\\"Brewery's Skull Splitter headache\\". (18 September 2008) BBC News. Retrieved 11 January 2014. Interpretations Kjarvalr √çrakonungr appears in the Landn√°mab√≥k and has been identified as Cerball mac D√∫nlainge, King of Osraige who died in 888. There is clearly a chronological problem with Earl Hlodvir, whose son Sigurd was killed at Clontarf in 1014, marrying the daughter of a king who died more than 120 years before that. Furthermore, Thorstein \\"the Red\\" Olafsson (fl. late 9th century and Hlodvir's great grandfather) was apparently married to a granddaughter of Kjarvalr. Woolf (2007) concludes that the saga writers may have confused this story about the provenance of Sigurd Hlodvirsson with one about Thorstein, a close ally of Sigurd Eysteinsson.Woolf (2007) pp. 283-84 Thomson (2008) concludes that there is \\"no real reason to trust the details of this bloodthirsty story\\" about Thorfinn's children, and speculates about the saga writer's intentions. The joint rulership of earls was a recurring theme in the period up to 1214 and was \\"inherently unstable and usually ended in violence\\". He identifies these family feuds as being the main theme of the Orkneyinga saga, culminating in the martyrdom of St Magnus c.1115, and that the writer is emphasising the doom of \\"kin-slaying\\". The connection with Erik Bloodaxe may also have been made to illustrate the continuing influence of the Norwegian ruling families in Orcadian affairs, which lessened in the late 10th century when Scandinavian expeditions tended to be directed towards England \\"by-passing Orkney and allowing the earls greater scope for independent action\\". In this context Ragnhild may have been not so much the cause of the Thorfinsson's troubles as the \\"prize for the winner\\". Although he never became de facto earl, Skuli Thorfinsson's relationship with the Scots offers some insight into the politics of the north of Scotland in the late tenth century. In the Orkneyinga saga it is claimed that he requested the support of the \\"king of Scots\\" for his claim to Caithness. However it is far from certain that the kings of Scots were in a position to offer any authority so far north at this time. The Irish annalists referred to the rulers of Moray by the title Ri Alban and it is possible that the saga writer meant the former by this term. Crawford (1987) suggests that \\"if the late ninth-century conquest of northern Scotland by Thorstein the Red and Sigurd the Mighty had indeed led to permanent colonies in Caithness and along the coastal areas of Sutherland, then the late tenth century struggle may have been a result of aggression from the Scottish side in an attempt to regain control of the northernmost province of the Scottish mainland\\".Crawford (1987) p.64 See also * Battle of Stainmore - where Erik Bloodaxe was killed.

It is located in the northern parts of the Ilava Basin and is one of the largest communities of the Pova≈æie region. History The archaeological evidence shows that the village has been inhabited already in the Neolithic and early Bronze Age. It was mentioned for the first time in a written document in 1330. There is a Romanesque St Anne chapel from the mid-13th century in the village. This was already mentioned in the Papal documentation in 1332 which makes the rectory one of oldest one on the river V√°h. The little church can be still found in the village center. The main church located right next to it has been dedicated to St. Elizabeth and it was built in 1560. The newest church standing in Belu≈°a Hlo≈æa is known as Our Lady of Sorrows church and was built in 1990. It is clearly visible from the D1 freeway. Finally, in Belu≈°a part Hlo≈æa on the Trenƒçiansk√° Street can be also found a small St. John of Nepomuk chapel. This one has been standing there since 1766. The close proximity to the river V√°h as well Pru≈æinka creek brought several times devastating floods to the village. The worst on record happened between August 26‚Äì28, 1813 and June the 2nd 1823 respectively. The most recent one took place in 1939. Pru≈æinka Creek has been regulated since 1940 and therefore effectively preventing any further flooding. Fire in September 1827 burned 130 houses. In the beginning of the 19th Century the town inaugurated the first basket-maker school of the Kingdom of Hungary. Plague, which was major problem in Europe wiped out 262 inhabitants in 1831. An important day for the village was July 24, 1913 which brought the first pharmacy to Belu≈°a. The license was issued to Julius Thaller. The first pharmacy was located very close to the church. Until 1918, Belu≈°a municipality in the county Trenƒç√≠n (same as the rest of Slovakia) has been a part of the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Trianon Treaty it became part of the newly formed Czechoslovakia. Prior to the World War II there used to be a small Jewish community in the village. Currently the only proof of their presence is a small Jewish cemetery hidden in the north part of the village. It has been recently renovated and it's been documented in the Jewish archives. Geography The municipality lies at an altitude of 251 metres and covers an area of 51.343 km¬≤. Belusa has a population of about 6060 inhabitants. The municipality consists of four parts: Belu≈°a, Belu≈°sk√© Slatiny, Hlo≈æa, Podhorie (incorporated in 1976). The town hall is located in Belu≈°a. The village is also an important crossroad on the main road from Trenƒç√≠n to ≈Ωilina. The main freeway D1 connecting Bratislava with ≈Ωilina bypasses Belu≈°a. The main railway line from Bratislava to Ko≈°ice via ≈Ωilina has got a stop here. The railway line built in the years 1878-1883 helped significantly to the development. In 1883 the railways station was completed. Currently the line is being updated to the higher speed. Once fully completed the average train speed should be around 160 km/h. River V√°h (tributary of the Danube river) flows close to the village. Belu≈°a Baths/Belu≈°sk√© Slatiny Part of Belu≈°a are also the Belu≈°a Baths (Belu≈°sk√© Slatiny).

There is a direct connection between the spring in Belu≈°a Baths and the one in the spa resort town of Trenƒçianske Teplice.

In the United States, the exact ratio of fuel ethanol to hydrocarbon may vary according to ASTM 5798 that specifies the allowable ethanol content in E85 as ranging from 51% to 83%.\\"Handbook for Handling, Storing, and Dispensing E85 and Other Ethanol-Gasoline Blends.\\" US Department of Energy. afdc.energy.gov Retrieved October 2, 2013. This is due to the lower heating value of neat ethanol making it difficult to crank engines in relatively cold climates without pre-heating air intake, faster cranking, or mixing varying fractions of gasoline according to climate. Cold cranking in cold climates is the primary reason ethanol fuel is blended with any gasoline fraction. In Brazil, ethanol fuel is neat at the pumps, hence flexible-fuel vehicles (FFV) including trucks, tractors, motorbikes and mopeds run on E100. The 85% fraction is commonly sold at pumps worldwide (outside the US), and when specifically supplied or sold as E85 is always 85% ethanol (at pumps or in barrel). Having a guaranteed ethanol fraction obviates the need for a vehicle system to calculate best engine tune according to maximise performance and economy. In countries like Australia where E85 is always 85% ethanol (and pump fuel with varying fractions is called \\"flex fuel\\"), performance motoring enthusiasts and motor racing clubs/championships use E85 extensively (without the need for any FFV certification). Use of alcohol (ethanol and methanol) in motor racing history parallels the invention of the automobile, favoured due to inherent combustion characteristics such as high thermal efficiency, raised torque and with some advanced engines, better specific fuel consumption. In the United States, government subsidies of ethanol in general and E85 in particular have encouraged a growing infrastructure for the retail sale of E85, especially in corn growing states in the Midwest. Fuel economy =Specific fuel consumption= E85 promoters and the Society of Automotive Engineers contend that automotive manufacturers currently fail to equal the fuel consumption of gasoline because they fail to take advantages of characteristics which are superior in ethanol-based fuel blends. They claim that some ethanol engines have already produced 22% more miles per gallon than identical gasoline engines. Ethanol advocates also state that it is a mistake to base ethanol engine design on gasoline engine design, and that ethanol engines should be based on diesel engine design parameters instead. Using this approach, the EPA has produced an ethanol-only engine which achieves much higher brake thermal efficiency levels than gasoline engines achieve.US EPA/OAR/Office of Transportation & Air Quality/Advanced Technology Division and FEV Engine Technology; Inc. \\"Economical, High- Efficiency Engine Technologies for Alcohol Fuels\\" Mileage is dependent upon the composition of the ethanol-gasoline blend, transmission, state of engine tune (primarily fuel-air mixture, spark timing and compression ratio). In the United States to offset this difference in fuel consumption in vehicles not optimised for ethanol, legislation has been passed to subsidize its cost. =Energy value= In contrast, ethanol critics contest the benefits of E85 by focusing on the fact that E85 has 33% lower heating value compared to the higher heating value of gasoline. However comparing energy expressed as a value of heat does not reflect the total work from an Otto Cycle. Because energy content does not factor certain latent or specific heat values, nor combustion pressure, so looking at heat alone in the combustion equation does not determine efficiency or work according to the laws of thermodynamics. Octane and performance E85 fuel dispenser at a regular gasoline station =Use in flexible-fuel vehicles= E85 ethanol is used in engines modified to accept higher concentrations of ethanol. In the US such FFVs are designed to run on any mixture of gasoline or ethanol up to 85% ethanol, whereas in countries such as Brazil where the climate is typically warmer, FFV run on neat alcohol. There are a few major differences between FFVs and non-FFVs. One is the elimination of bare magnesium, aluminum, and rubber parts in the fuel system. Fuel injection control systems have a wider range of pulse widths to inject up to 34% more fuel (which in turn produces more power). Stainless steel fuel lines, sometimes lined with plastic, and stainless-steel fuel tanks in place of terne fuel tanks have been used. In some cases, FFVs use specific engine oil that neutralises acidity. For vehicles with in-tank-mounted fuel pumps, precautions to prevent arcing, as well as flame arrestors positioned in the tank's fill pipe, are sometimes used. =Octane rating= As more effort is put into maximizing an engine to take advantage of E85's higher \\"octane\\", engines achieve greater power advantages. One car that has higher power on ethanol is the Koenigsegg CCXR, which on ethanol is the fifth-most powerful production car, with 20% more hp on E85 than on gasoline. According to the manufacturer, this is due to the cooling properties of ethanol. E85 has an octane rating higher than that of regular gasoline's typical rating of 87, or premium gasoline's 91-93. This allows it to be used in higher-compression engines, which tend to produce more power per unit of displacement than their gasoline counterparts. Examples of octane mis-citation can be found at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association titled \\"E85 Facts\\"Iowa Renewable Fuels Association \\"E85 Facts\\" which cites a range of 100-105, and a document at the Texas State Energy Conservation Office titled \\"Ethanol\\",Texas State Energy Conservation Office \\"Ethanol\\" which cites a 113 rating. Some vehicles can be converted to use E85 despite not being specifically built for it. Because of the lower heating value E85 has a cooler intake charge‚Äîwhich, coupled with its high stability level from its high octane rating‚Äîhas also been used as a \\"power adder\\" in turbocharged performance vehicles. These modifications have not only resulted in lower GHG emissions, but typically resulted in 10-12% power and torque increase at the wheels. Where the engine was previously knock limited by gasoline, power improvements are as high as 40%. Because of its low price (less than $2.00/gal in some places) and high availability in certain areas people have started to turn to using it in place of high-end racing fuels, which typically cost over $10.00/gal. Emissions There are four primary types of pollutants scientists study. These emissions are hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Because E85 is predominantly ethanol, the exhaust emissions are very different from those of regular gasoline. Numerous studies have compared and contrasted the different emissions and the effects these emissions have on the environment, but the tests have been inconclusive. The tests have shown very little consistency if any at all because there are too many variables involved. The make and model of the vehicle, the way in which the ethanol was produced and the vehicle's overall fuel efficiency all play a large role in the overall outcome of each study.Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association, Vol. 59 (Issue 8) To address the problem of inaccuracy, engineers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory combined data from all applicable emissions studies and compiled them into one data set. This compiled set of data showed that on average all emissions that are federally regulated showed a decrease or no statistically relevant difference between E85 and gasoline.Atmospheric Environment, Vol. 45, Issue 39 EPA's stringent tier-II vehicle emission standards require that FFVs achieve the same low emissions level regardless whether E85 or gasoline is used. However, E85 can further reduce emissions of certain pollutants as compared to conventional gasoline or lower-volume ethanol blends. For example, E85 is less volatile than gasoline or low-volume ethanol blends, which results in fewer evaporative emissions. Using E85 also reduces carbon-monoxide emissions and provides significant reductions in emissions of many harmful toxics, including benzene, a known human carcinogen. However, E85 in certain engine operating conditions may increase emissions of acetaldehyde. EPA is conducting additional analysis to expand our understanding of the emissions impacts of E85. Controversy =Economics= A study by Purdue University found that the economic benefit of E85 is highly dependent on the price of crude oil. =Food vs. fuel= E85 critics contend that production of ethanol from corn (maize) drives up world food prices, causing corn to be unaffordable or even unavailable. E85 advocates counter that concern by pointing out that over 93% of all corn grown in the United States is never fed directly to people, but is instead used as livestock feed. Corn used to produce ethanol contains a high amount of starch and is not easily digestible by humans, like sweet corn. American farmers grow more corn than people purchase; there is an annual surplus of corn in the U.S. E85 advocates say that corn prices have increased due to manipulation of the commodities markets and because American corn companies sell more and more US- grown corn to Mexico and China, creating more competition for corn buyers, and therefore driving up its price. E85 critics contend that ethanol producers may not reduce carbon emissions due to the petroleum and natural gas used in raising corn and refining it. E85 advocates reply by pointing to ethanol producers who do not do so, but instead use E85 or biodiesel fuel to transport E85, and use biomass as a heat source for the distillation of ethanol instead of petro-products like natural gas. Some say that cellulosic ethanol produced from waste materials or fast growing non-food crops such as switchgrass is much more beneficial, but not yet economically practical at large scale. Others say that the world can easily replace all of its use of petroleum by simply making ethanol from the many crops that yield more ethanol per acre than corn yields, with existing technology, not future technology,Alcohol Can Be a Gas Blume, David 2007 Preheating; pp. 406‚Äì410, Advancement of Ignition Timing: pp. 404, 417-18, 530 'Higher Compression with Ethanol'pp. 70, 358-60, 415-19,429, 433-435 and that certain elements in the cellulosic ethanol field are more interested in patent rights than in producing the greatest amount of ethanol at the lowest price point. Availability and price Opening of an E85 retail pump in Maryland E85 is increasingly common in the United States, mainly in the Midwest where corn is a major crop and is the primary source material for ethanol-fuel production. As of July 1, 2014, there were more than 3,300 fuel stations that offered E85 fuel. E85 as a fuel is widely used in Sweden; however, most of it is imported from Italy and Brazil. E85 was formerly available from the Maxol chain in Ireland, where it was made from whey, a byproduct of cheese manufacturing. The availability ended in 2011, due to a severe excise-duty hike which rendered it economically unviable. In Finland E85 is available from 52 St1 chain locations and 71 ABC chain locations. The E85 sold by St1 is labeled as RE85 and as \\"Eko E85\\" in ABC- stations to indicate it is manufactured from Finnish bio-waste. By way of international price comparison, in the Cook Islands as with many of the Pacific Islands, cost of producing 100% ethanol from coconut biomass is a fraction of obtaining fossil fuels. US price regulation The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) to subsidize production costs. The 2008 Farm Bill reduced the VEETC's 51-cent tax credit to 45 cents. Other measures taken by Congress to jump start ethanol production include the 2004 VEETC bill, which provided for a Small Ethanol Producer Tax Credit which gave tax credits to small ethanol producers. More recently, the Tax Relief Act, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization Act, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the tax cuts allowed by VEETC from the end of 2010 to the end of 2012.http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/2011/03/28/epa-pushes-ethanol- on-american-consumers/ In the United States, to realize equivalent fuel economy at the pump with an FFV, the price of E85 must be much lower than gasoline. E85 was at least 20% less expensive in most areas as recently as 2011. In one US test, an early model 2.75-ton Chevy Tahoe FFV averaged 18 MPG (U.S. gallons) for gasoline and 13 MPG for E85, 28% worse than gasoline. However, in Australia, where Holden has sold more than 70,000 FFVs since 2010, the difference in combined consumption on similar V8 variants in a family sedan is between 10% and 20%. In 2010, the cost of gas in the US averaged $3.42, while the cost for E85 averaged $3.09, or 90% of the cost of gasoline. In another test, however, a fleet of Ford Tauruses averaged only about 6% fewer miles per gallon in ethanol-based vehicles when compared to traditional, gas-powered Tauruses.

He is notable for being the first Japanese player to play for a Major League Baseball team. Sent over to the United States by the Nankai Hawks, Murakami saw success as a reliever for the San Francisco Giants, debuting at the age of 20 in . In , he struck out over one batter per inning pitched, posted an ERA under 4 and earned eight saves. Following this season, however, Murakami headed back to his original Japanese club due to contractual obligations, where his success continued for another 17 years. Biography Murakami entered the Japanese Pacific League professional team, the Nankai Hawks, in September , while still attending high school. In 1964, his team sent him, along with two other young players, to the San Francisco Giants single-A team Fresno as a baseball \\"exchange student\\". He was originally only scheduled to stay in the United States until June, but the Hawks neglected to call him back to Japan, and he stayed with the Giants for the rest of the season. In August of the same year, he was promoted to the majors, and on September 1, 1964, he became the first Japanese player to play in the major leagues and the first Asian-born player since Chinese-born Harry Kingman's cup of coffee 50 years earlier. He entered the ninth inning against the New York Mets and pitched to four batters, striking out two and allowing just one hit and zero runs. He pitched the final three innings of an 11-inning 5-4 win by the Giants on September 29 over the Houston Colt .45s to get his first career win. In nine games with the Giants, he pitched a total of 15 innings while allowing eight hits and three runs (with all of the runs occurring in his final game on October 4th) while having 15 strikeouts and one walk for a 1.80 ERA. Murakami's performance caused the Giants to refuse the Hawks' order to return him to Japan. The argument escalated during the 1964 off-season, and Japanese baseball commissioner Yushi Uchimura was called in to make the final decision on which team Murakami would play with. The commissioner made a compromise; Murakami would return to the Hawks after he had played for another full season with the Giants. He wore number 10 with the San Francisco Giants. He appeared in 45 games, pitching a total of 74 1‚ÅÑ3 innings while going 4-1 with a 3.75 ERA, 85 strikeouts and 22 walks. Murakami returned to the Hawks in , but failed to live up to the team's high expectations. He proved himself by winning 18 games in , and contributed to the team's league championship in , but was traded to the Hanshin Tigers in the off-season. He did not pitch well, and the Tigers released him after one year, but the Nippon Ham Fighters picked him up. He made a comeback in , winning 12 games, and contributing to the team's league championship in . Murakami retired in , but returned to the San Francisco Giants spring camp in . He was not signed as a player, but became a batting practice pitcher for Giants' home games. On July 20, 2018, at the Japan Information and Cultural Center, in Washington, DC, Ã™l to RÀà Robert Fitts, Yuriko Gamo Romer, Masanori \\"Mashi\\" Murakami, Adam, discussed U.S.-Japan baseball relations.He worked as a commentator from to , and became a minor league pitching coach for the Nippon Ham Fighters from to . He also served as a pitching coach for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks and Seibu Lions. He also briefly worked as a scout for the San Francisco Giants, and is now a commentator for NHK major league baseball games, and writes for the Daily Sports newspaper. In , Murakami was presented with the Foreign Minister's Certificate of Commendation in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Japan-US relationship by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan. Murakami was honored by the San Francisco Giants at AT&T; Park on Friday, May 16, 2008, when a limited edition Murakami bobblehead was given away at the evening game against the Chicago White Sox as part of the team's \\"Japanese Heritage Night\\" promotion. He was again honored on the 50th anniversary of his debut on Friday, May 15, 2014 during the team's \\"Japanese Heritage Night\\" promotion and game attendees were given a figuring-style bust of Murakami, and threw out the first pitch of the game. Pitching style Murakami was not an overpowering pitcher. His fastball was only in the low to mid 80 mph range, even during his prime. His best pitch was a sharp screwball, which he learned in the majors, and he also threw a good changeup and curve. He was a valuable reliever, being a left-hander throwing from the sidearm. His total record in two years in the majors was 5‚Äì1, 9 saves, with a 3.43 ERA in 54 games. Language skills Murakami could barely speak or understand English when he first came to the United States, and always had a dictionary on hand to communicate with teammates. When promoted to the majors, he was told to go to New York City (where the San Francisco Giants were playing), and was given his plane ticket on the spot. In New York, he signed a major league contract even though he could not read a single word written on the contract. The authors of 1973's semi-satirical reference, The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book, stated that Murakami was \\"with the possible exception of Yogi Berra, the only major league ballplayer who did not speak English.\\" Notes External links *, Alexander Kleinberg, MLB.com, 24 December 2001. *Japanese league stats and info of Masanori Murakami 1944 births Fresno Giants players Hanshin Tigers players Japanese expatriate baseball players in the United States Living people Major League Baseball pitchers Major League Baseball players from Japan Nankai Hawks players Nippon Ham Fighters players People from ≈åtsuki, Yamanashi Baseball people from Yamanashi Prefecture San Francisco Giants players ","title":"Masanori Murakami"},{"id":"1768549","text":"The Nanking Incident () occurred in March 1927 during the capture of Nanjing (then Nanking) by the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) in their Northern Expedition. Foreign warships bombarded the city to defend foreign residents against rioting and looting. Several ships were involved in the engagement, including vessels of the Royal Navy and the United States Navy. Marines and sailors were also landed for rescue operations. Both Nationalist and Communist soldiers within the NRA participated in the rioting and looting of foreign- owned property in Nanjing.Beede, p. 355. Context Nanking in 1927 was a treaty port located on the southern shores of the Yangtze River, a large waterway that separates northern and southern China. Because the foreign interests in China were largely American and European, squadrons of foreign naval vessels were stationed along the Yangtze to protect their citizens doing business at the treaty ports. The British Royal Navy operated the China Station under Rear Admiral Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt and the United States Navy the Yangtze Patrol; both lasted for around 80 years until World War II. The American destroyer . Incident On 23 March 1927, with the rapidly approaching National Revolutionary Army (NRA) about to reach Nanjing, Beiyang warlord Zhang Zongchang gave orders for his defeated troops to withdraw from the city. Some of his soldiers who were unable to retreat in time deserted and began to loot foreign properties and attacked two foreigners who were in their way.Tolley, p. 150‚Äì160. The British cruiser In the early morning of 24 March, the NRA began to enter Nanjing without any resistance from Zhang Zongchang's army. Afterwards they entered the British, American and Japanese consulates to search for suspected enemies hiding inside, but left peacefully after none were found. But immediately afterwards, uniformed soldiers and local Chinese residents started large-scale rioting against foreign interests, burning houses and attacking the British, American and Japanese consulates, and killing the American vice president of Nanking University, Dr. John Elias Williams, while almost assassinating the Japanese consul. The 6th Army of the NRA, with its large contingent of communist soldiers, systematically looted the homes and businesses of the foreign residents, and one American, two Britons, one French citizen, an Italian, and a Japanese were killed by Chinese soldiers. Chinese snipers also targeted the American consul and marines who were guarding him, which forced them to flee into \\"Socony Hill\\" where American citizens were sheltering. During this mayhem, one Chinese soldier declared, \\"we don't want money, anyway, we want to kill.\\" In response, the British navy immediately sent the heavy cruiser , the light cruisers and , the minesweeper , and the destroyers , , , , , , and toward Nanjing. The gunboat arrived toward the end of the engagement, and was also involved in the naval operations at the time. Five American destroyers were also sent to engage the NRA; including under Roy C. Smith, , , and .IJN Gunboat NARUMI: Tabular Record of Movement, Japanese Gunboats, Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp and Peter Cundall. Retrieved March 24, 2012 At 3:38 pm, the NRA soldiers and Chinese rioters were driven off by high explosive rounds and machine gun fire from Emerald, Wolsey, Noa, Preston and Carlotto, and other warships may have participated in the bombardment as well. After the bombardment, foreign civilians hiding on Sacony Hill were rescued by sailors from Noa and Preston. The two American vessels fired 67 shells by this point and thousands of rifle and machine gun rounds. By the end of March 24, Nanking was burning and littered with bomb craters and casualties from the battle. Early the next morning, just before dawn, USS William B. Preston was lifting anchor to escort SS Kungwo out of the area. She was filled with evacuees and needed protection, but just as the two ships were starting to leave, sniper fire from the riverbanks hit Preston. The Americans returned fire with their Lewis gun and silenced the attackers after a few moments. Three hours later, as the two vessels steamed down the river, Preston was attacked again. This time, the two ships were in between Silver Island and Fort Hsing-Shan. Rifle fire was first heard, and Preston‚Ä≤s crew were preparing their machine gun when guns at the fort suddenly engaged them. Several shots missed the ships, but one eventually hit Preston‚Ä≤s fire control platform, causing no casualties. A gun was then aimed at the fort, and after a few rounds the Chinese guns were silenced. After turning Kungwo over to the British, William B. Preston returned to Nanking and later joined HMS Cricket and SS Wen-chow, south of Chinkiang. Snipers once again harassed the ships, but machine gun fire from Cricket quickly forced the Chinese to retreat. Later on the Japanese sent the gunboats Hodero, Katata, Momo and Shinoki. The Italians sent the gunboat Ermanno Carlotto and the French sent aviso La Marne for the evacuation of their citizens in Nanjing. By March 26, NRA commander Cheng Qian restored order in Nanjing and successfully restrained soldiers from further hostile actions against foreign forces, while requesting the Red Cross to mediate a cease fire with foreign naval vessels. On March 27, with 70 more refugees aboard, Preston left Nanking and headed downriver. Lieutenant Commander G. B. Ashe later recalled that the Chinese had emplaced a field-piece at a river bend outside of Nanking so he ordered general quarters well in advance of the battery, but when the ship went around the bend the Chinese did not fire. By the end of that day all hostilities ended. About 40 people were killed in total. At least one British sailor was killed, and there was only one American casualty, fireman Ray D. Plumley. American forces involved in the Nanking Incident received the Yangtze Service Medal. Three U.S. Navy signalmen who maintained consular communications from the building's roof while under continuous fire were also awarded the Navy Cross. Aftermath Afterwards, the Nationalist Government issued a statement blaming the deserters from Zhang Zongchang's army for starting the attacks on the foreign consulates, and also accused the Communist soldiers within the NRA of committing atrocities which were wrongly assigned to the Kuomintang. National Revolutionary Army commander in chief Chiang Kai-shek suspected that the Communist Party of China and Soviet advisors in the Wuhan Nationalist Government used anti-imperialists and anti- foreign sentiments to instigate the Nanjing incident, and conspired to strengthen the communists and damage the right-wing faction of the Kuomintang. Therefore, the Nanjing incident led to his determination to violently purge the communists from the Kuomintang in Shanghai on 12 April 1927, formally ending their cooperation during the Northern Expedition and officially commencing the Chinese Civil War. In 1928, Huang Fu, foreign minister of the newly formed Nationalist government in Nanjing, reached agreements with the United States and Great Britain to settle the damages caused by the Nanjing Incident, and the Kuomintang agreed to apologize and pay significant compensation to both countries without disclosing the exact sum to save face for the Chinese. Although the Kuomintang suffered financial loss as a result of this settlement, the Nationalist government did receive international recognition and established formal diplomatic relationship with two of the world's great powers for the first time after the Northern Expedition.ÂÆâÂæΩÂè≤Â≠¶, 2012Âπ¥Á¨¨01Êúü, \\"„ÄäÁî≥Êä•„ÄãÂÖ≥‰∫é1927Âπ¥Âçó‰∫¨‰∫ã‰ª∂Êä•ÈÅì‰πãÂàÜÊûê\\" Literature *Edna Lee Booker, News Is My Job, (The Macmillan Company, 1940) *Alice Tisdale Hobart, Within the Walls of Nanking (Macmillan, 1929) *United States Naval Institute Proceedings, January 1928 ‚Äì the account of the Lieutenant Commander Roy C.

It was used and perfected at Princeton University by Pete Carril, though its roots may be traced back to Franklin ‚ÄúCappy‚Äù Cappon, who coached Princeton in the late 1930s,\\"Cappon SHeart Attack: 'Cappy' Dies After Practice At Princeton\\". Holland Evening Sentinel. 1961-11-30. and Bernard \\"Red\\" Sarachek, who coached at Yeshiva University from 1938 to 1977. Concept The offense is designed for a unit of five players who can each pass, shoot, and dribble at an above-average level. These players hope to exploit a mismatch in which the offense can exploit. It attempts to isolate and exploit a mismatch using these skills. Positions become less important and on offense there is no point guard, shooting guard, small forward or power forward. However, there are certain rules that players running this offense are expected to follow. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc with one player at the top of the key. The ball is kept in constant motion through passing until either a mismatch allows a player to cut to the basket or a player without the ball cuts toward the unoccupied area under and around the basket, and is passed the ball for a layup. The post player is a very important player in the offense. He sets up in the high post and draws attention to his positioning. When the ball is received in to the post the players main objective is to find back door cutters or defenders who have fallen asleep on the weak side. The hallmark of the offense is the backdoor pass, where a player on the wing suddenly moves in towards the basket, receives a bounce pass from a guard on the perimeter, and (if done correctly) finds himself with no defenders between him and a layup. Alternatively, when the defensive team attempts to pack the paint to prevent backdoor cuts, the offense utilizes three point shots from the perimeter. All five players in the offense‚Äîincluding the center‚Äîshould be competent at making a three-point attempt, further spreading the floor, and not allowing the defense to leave any player unattended. The offense is often a very slowly developing one, relying on a high number of passes, and is often used in college basketball by teams facing opponents with superior athletic talent in order to maintain a low-scoring game (believing that a high-scoring game would favor the athletically superior opponent). As a result, Princeton has led the nation in scoring defense 19 times including in every year from 1989 to 2000. Use at Princeton During his tenure as head coach of Princeton (1967‚Äì1996), Pete Carril compiled a 514‚Äì261 record, a .658 winning percentage. His teams won 13 Ivy League championships during his 29-year tenure with the Tigers, and received 11 NCAA Tournament bids and two National Invitation Tournament berths. Princeton captured the NIT title in 1975. Perhaps Carril's greatest win was his final upset victory on a backdoor cut to give Princeton the win 43 - 41 over the 1995 defending NCAA champion UCLA. The win extended Coach Carril's retirement by one game and is ranked as one of the best NCAA upsets of all time. Former Princeton coach Sydney Johnson and his predecessors Bill Carmody, John Thompson III, and Joe Scott have all employed the Princeton offense. Other examples of use =National Basketball Association= After his retirement from Princeton in 1996, Pete Carril served as an assistant coach for the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings until 2006. During his time with Sacramento, Carril helped Rick Adelman, who became the Kings' head coach in 1998, implement the Princeton offense. Carril returned to the Kings during the 2008‚Äì2009 season as a consultant. The Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Lakers, New Orleans Hornets, New Jersey Nets, and Washington Wizards also have run versions of the Princeton offense. in the National Basketball Association. Rick Adelman introduced a modified version of Pete Carril's system to the Houston Rockets during the 2007‚Äì2008 season. Coach Alvin Gentry also implemented an altered version of it that shows similarities to the triangle offense during the Phoenix Suns‚Ä≤s 2012‚Äì13 season. Eddie Jordan implemented the Princeton offense as coach of the Washington Wizards from 2003 to 2008) and of the Philadelphia 76ers from 2009 to 2010. =College basketball= NCAA Division I Besides Princeton, some of the NCAA Division I college basketball teams best known for using the offense are: *Air Force under Joe Scott, a former Carril player and prot√©g√© and former Princeton head coach *American under Mike Brennan, a former Princeton player and assistant coach *Brown under Craig Robinson, a former Princeton player and Northwestern assistant coach *University of Colorado, under head coach Jeff Bzdelik *Denver under former Princeton coach Joe Scott *Georgetown under John Thompson III, who played under Carril at Princeton and was later Princeton‚Ä≤s head coach *Holy Cross under Bill Carmody, another Carril prot√©g√© and a former Princeton head coach *Miami under Charlie Coles *North Dakota under Brian Jones *Notre Dame under Muffet McGraw *Oregon State under Craig Robinson, a former Princeton player and Northwestern assistant coach *Richmond under Chris Mooney, a former Princeton player and assistant coach at Air Force *Samford under Jimmy Tillette *Southern California under Tim Floyd *Virginia under Tony Bennett, loosely based on the general principles of the Princeton offense *Wisconsin, under coach Bo Ryan, ran the \\"swing offense,\\" which was loosely based on the Princeton offense *William & Mary under Tony Shaver NCAA Division II NCAA Division II colleges that have used the Princeton offense include: *Alabama-Huntsville under Lennie Acuff *Christian Brothers under Mike Nienaber *Rollins under Tom Klusman *Seattle Pacific under Jeff Hironaka NCAA Division III NCAA Division III colleges that have used the Princeton offense include: *Maryville under Kevin Carroll *St. Thomas, (St. Paul, Minnesota) under John Tauer NAIA NAIA colleges that have used the Princeton offense include: * Westmont under John Moore =High schools= High school basketball teams that have used the Princeton offense include: * Northridge High School (Johnstown, OH) 2008-2012 under John Wheeler * Oak Forest High School (Oak Forest, IL) 2008-2020 under Matt Manzke Canada *Cardinal Leger Secondary School (Brampton, Ontario) under Steve Pettit *Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (Vancouver, British Columbia) under Kevin Sandher *Mark R.

Located at the border of the San Joaquin Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area, Mountain House is 5 miles (8 km) northwest from the City of Tracy, 2 miles north of Interstate 205 and about 50 miles east of San Francisco. History The Cholbon triblet of the Northern Valley Yokuts were the original inhabitants of the Mountain House area. Their territory ran along Old River a distributary of the San Joaquin River. In 1849 Thomas Goodall erected a blue denim cloth tent to serve as a midway stopover for gold miners headed from San Francisco to the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) foothills via Altamont Pass. Goodall eventually built an adobe house at the eastern edge of the Diablo Range hills, calling it The Mountain House. Simon Zimmerman later acquired the stop and it became known as Zimmerman's Mountain House and became a well-known way station stop on the way to Stockton. The last remaining settlement buildings were leveled in 1940. In November 1994, the San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors officially approved the new community of Mountain House. In 1996 the master plan was approved. In August 2000 many of the documents controlling the development and growth of Mountain House were adopted and approved by the San Joaquin Board of Supervisors acting as the Mountain House Board of Directors. (ns) Mountain House was projected to be a small full-fledged city developed over 30-year period by the Master Developer Trimark Communities. The community covers 4,784 acres (1,936.0 ha) in San Joaquin County. The town was planned for 12 distinct neighborhoods including 10 family neighborhoods and two age-restricted neighborhoods each organized around a center containing a neighborhood park, a K-8 school, and a small commercial area. Construction began in 2001, but growth slowed down to about 50 permits per year because of the Great Recession in 2008. Development started again with increasing building permits and small land development projects in 2010 and 2011 and has continued at a high rate through 2019. , Mountain House includes the established villages of Wicklund (first), Bethany, Altamont, Questa, Hansen and the developing sixth village of Cordes. Some 15,000 households or approximately 45,000-50,000 people are anticipated when Mountain House is fully completed. =Milestones= * November 10, 1994 ‚Äì Mountain House project approved by San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors MHCSD offices open is Stockton * May 14, 2001 ‚Äì Trimark breaks ground on Mountain House project * January 18, 2003 ‚Äì First home foundation poured * August 24, 2004 ‚Äì Wicklund Elementary School opens.

With home values decreasing across the nation, Mountain House was described as the worst-hit, with 90% of its homes worth less than the amount their owners owe in mortgages. The average homeowner in Mountain House was reported to be $122,000 in debt. Many local businesses in the 95391 ZIP code were closing because the homeowners were cutting back on their spending. CalPERS, an agency that manages pensions for California public employees, invested heavily in Mountain House beginning in 2005, purchasing approximately 9,000 residential lots from Shea Homes. By May 2010, the $1.12 billion investment by CalPERS had been reduced to 18% of that figure: $200 million. Even though home values had dropped significantly, CalPERS determined that they would hold on to the investment, counting on a recovery of the housing market. =Economic recovery= An uptick in economic performance at Mountain House was noted in September 2011 by Big Builder, a trade magazine of major land and housing development published by Hanley-Wood. Acknowledging the New York Times 2008 article that branded Mountain House as the most underwater community in America, the article chronicled a grassroots commitment by residents to keep their neighborhoods looking well-kept by mowing neglected lawns of homes in foreclosure, short sales or abandoned. This community spirit helped persuade CalPERS to hold onto its Mountain House investment, despite the drawbacks of a 1994-vintage land plan, termed \\"out of synch with the realities of the post-housing crash world.\\" Helping to balance the challenges of the land plan was the level of established infrastructure and homebuyers motivated by affordable pricing, proximity to job centers and traditional neighborhoods. In April 2012, Big Builder again reported on the community, noting more robust first-quarter sales, new lot offers, and flexibility for semi-finished and raw land in future development. Geography Mountain House lies on the foothills of the Diablo Range, and close to the Altamont Pass which is over 1000 feet in elevation. It is on the border of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 3.2 square miles (8.3 km2), all of it land. The community is bisected by Mountain House Creek. Mountain House Creek originates south of the Altamont Pass and Interstate 580, flowing northeasterly along and crossing under the interstate, then along Grant Line Road to the intersection with Mountain House Road at the historic Alameda County Mountain House. The creek continues northeasterly through the residential communities of Mountain House before emptying into the Old River, a distributary of the San Joaquin River. =Climate= Winter (Dec-Feb) temperatures in Mountain House range from 30s to 60s. Springs (Mar-May) in Mountain House are mild with temperatures in the range of 40s to 80s. Summers (Jun-Aug) can be very hot with temperatures in 80s to 100s. Fall (Sep-Nov) temperatures start hot in the 80s to 100s but cool down significantly by November 40s to 70s. Windy conditions are common.

Government The Mountain House Community Services District (MHCSD) is the local government and is governed since 2008 by 5 elected board members who live in the community (similar to the city council) and a general manager (similar to the city manager.) Before 2008, the MHCSD was governed by the San Joaquin County Supervisors. The MHCSD has 18 primary powers which include providing police (current contract with San Joaquin Sheriffs), fire (current contract with French Camp Fire), library services, water, sewer, garbage (current contract with West Valley Disposal), public recreation, road maintenance, street lights, graffiti abatement, CC&R; (Master Restrictions) enforcement, telecommunication services, converting utilities to underground, transportation services, flood control protection, wildlife habitat mitigation, pest and weed abatement, and dissemination of information.\\"Five elected in first race for Mountain House board\\", Stockton Record, November 5, 2008 Unlike incorporated cities, the MHCSD does not have power over land use or economic development. The current (2019‚Äì20) board members are President Bernice Tingle, VP Andy Su, Directors Dan Harrison, Manny Moreno and Brian Lucid. The current general manager is Steve Pinkerton who started in August 2019. Education =Elementary schools= Students in Mountain House are served by the Lammersville Joint Unified School District or LUSD. Mountain House children attend six LUSD K-8 elementary schools: Wicklund, Bethany, Questa, Altamont, Hansen and Cordes. Lammersville Elementary is a K-8 school in unincorporated San Joaquin County that is part of the LUSD but not part of Mountain House. Mountain House Elementary School, which is a K-8 school in unincorporated Alameda County, with a student body of approximately 50, run by the independent Mountain House Elementary School District. = Higher education = Mountain House High School (MHHS) opened in 2014 and is one of the top high schools in the state. MHHS received the California Distinguished School Award in 2019. The school mascot is the Mustang and the school colors are royal blue and silver. Sports teams from MHHS compete in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). A satellite campus of San Joaquin Delta College opened in August 2009 in Mountain House. Media Mountain House Matters is a monthly publication about Mountain House, its people and activities. It was founded in September 2012 by resident Bryan Harrison and mailed to each house in Mountain House. The Tracy Press is a weekly newspaper that covers Tracy and Mountain House and has operated since the 19th century. The Record (Stockton) is a daily paper that covers the San Joaquin County area.

The first written reference dates back to 1243, when B√©la IV., King of Hungary, signed his gift certificate to Vychlap Bechend. In this reference are also mentioned Leustrak's son and Puch from his immediate vicinities. The word \\"puch\\" is of Indo-European origin and it can be translated as \\"puffed up\\", \\"haughty\\" and \\"ov\\" is a possessive suffix, therefore this name can be translated as a former \\"land of Puch\\". There exist another version, that origin of town's name originates from the word \\"Pochov\\", which denotes a place many deceased from the whole vicinities were buried in the past. This claim was supported by many archaeological excavations of the graves throughout the centuries. P√∫chov vicinities, especially P√∫chovsk√° skala (P√∫chov rock) was settled earlier during palaeolithic period. The excavations give evidence of settlements since the early Stone Age to the Roman period. During 1888-1894 an Austrian Army commissioned officer, an amateur archaeologist, baron Emil Friedrich Johannes Hoenning O'Carroll carried out an exploration of P√∫chovsk√° Skala and his discovery of two bronze swords explained the town's ancient history. His discoveries later contributed to the origin of the official archaeological name P√∫chov culture. During the 7th ‚Äì 8th centuries was the town settled by Slavs and in the 9th century the Moravian settlements shared the most expansion. In 1469 Matthias Corvinus, the King of Hungary, gave P√∫chov homestead to the Marczib√°nyis, who were the lineal descendants of P√∫chovs since the 13th century. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 18,833 inhabitants. 97.4% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.3% Czechs and 0.2% Roma. The religious make-up was 71.4% Roman Catholics, 13.8% Lutherans, and 11.3% people with no religious affiliation. Economy It is a strong industry base - home to Matador and Continental Tire plants, producers of pneumatic tyres, and Makyta, a producer of fashion clothes. Matador is a 20-minute walk from the train station in P√∫chov, while the city center is a 10-minute walk in the other direction. Sport The number one sport in the town is football. The local team FK Matador P√∫chov had several successful seasons in the Slovak highest league, but currently is only in the Slovak second league. Among other sports, there has been a long tradition of swimming. Several of the best swimmers made it to the European championship. Some other sport clubs worth mentioning are volleyball and handball. The local ice hockey team is actually the Slovak National Ice Hockey Team under 20. The team named \\"Slovakia 20\\" is a permanent member of the highest Ice Hockey league. This was done as an experiment to help the young players to get more tough matches and increase their motivation. Cyclists, Peter and Martin Velits, come from P√∫chov as well.

Little is known about his life, except what is found in the biographies of other scientistsO'Connor & Robertson (1999) and that most mathematicians today can trace their lineage back to him.Mathematics Genealogy Project Extrema Around 1165, he moved to Damascus and taught mathematics there. He then lived in Aleppo for three years, before moving to Mosul, where he met his most famous disciple Kamal al-Din ibn Yunus (1156-1242). This Kamal al-Din would later become the teacher of another famous mathematician from Tus, Nasir al-Din al- Tusi. According to Ibn Abi Usaibi'a, Sharaf al-Din was \\"outstanding in geometry and the mathematical sciences, having no equal in his time\\".Mentioned in the biography of the Damascene architect and physician Abu al-Fadhl al- Harithi (d. 1202-3).  Mathematics  Al-Tusi has been credited with proposing the idea of a function, however his approach being not very explicit, Algebra's move to the dynamic function was made 5 centuries after him, by Gottfried Leibniz. Sharaf al-Din used what would later be known as the \\"Ruffini-Horner method\\" to numerically approximate the root of a cubic equation. He also developed a novel method for determining the conditions under which certain types of cubic equations would have two, one, or no solutions.O'Connor & Robertson (1999). To al-Tusi, \\"solution\\" meant \\"positive solution\\", since the possibility of zero or negative numbers being considered genuine solutions had yet to be recognised at the time (Hogendijk, 1989, p.71; 1997, p.894; Smith, 1997b, p.69). The equations in question can be written, using modern notation, in the form , where is a cubic polynomial in which the coefficient of the cubic term is , and is positive. The Muslim mathematicians of the time divided the potentially solvable cases of these equations into five different types, determined by the signs of the other coefficients of .The five types were:  * where and are positive numbers (Hogendijk, 1989, p.71). For any other values of the coefficients of and , the equation has no positive solution. For each of these five types, al-Tusi wrote down an expression for the point where the function attained its maximum, and gave a geometric proof that for any positive different from . He then concluded that the equation would have two solutions if , one solution if , or none if .Hogendijk (1989, p.71‚Äì2). Al-Tusi gave no indication of how he discovered the expressions for the maxima of the functions .Berggren (1990, p.307‚Äì8). Some scholars have concluded that al- Tusi obtained his expressions for these maxima by \\"systematically\\" taking the derivative of the function , and setting it equal to zero.Rashed (1994, p.49), Far√®s (1995). This conclusion has been challenged, however, by others, who point out that al-Tusi nowhere wrote down an expression for the derivative, and suggest other plausible methods by which he could have discovered his expressions for the maxima.Berggren (1990), Hogendijk (1989). The quantities which can be obtained from al-Tusi's conditions for the numbers of roots of cubic equations by subtracting one side of these conditions from the other is today called the discriminant of the cubic polynomials obtained by subtracting one side of the corresponding cubic equations from the other. Although al-Tusi always writes these conditions in the forms , , or , rather than the corresponding forms , , or ,Hogendijk (1989). Roshdi Rashed nevertheless considers that his discovery of these conditions demonstrated an understanding of the importance of the discriminant for investigating the solutions of cubic equations.Rashed (1994, pp.46‚Äì47, 342‚Äì43). Sharaf al-Din analyzed the equation x3 \\\\+ d = b‚ãÖx2 in the form x2 ‚ãÖ (b - x) = d, stating that the left hand side must at least equal the value of d for the equation to have a solution. He then determined the maximum value of this expression. A value less than d means no positive solution; a value equal to d corresponds to one solution, while a value greater than d corresponds to two solutions. Sharaf al-Din's analysis of this equation was a notable development in Islamic mathematics, but his work was not pursued any further at that time, neither in the Muslim world nor in Europe. Sharaf al-Din al- Tusi's \\"Treatise on equations\\" has been described as inaugurating the beginning of algebraic geometry.Rashed (1994, pp.102-3)  Astronomy  Sharaf al-Din invented a linear astrolabe, sometimes called the \\"staff of Tusi\\". While it was easier to construct and was known in al-Andalus, it did not gain much popularity. Honours The main-belt asteroid 7058 Al-·π¨≈´sƒ´, discovered by Henry E. Holt at Palomar Observatory in 1990, was named in his honor. Notes References  Retrieved March 21, 2011 from Encyclopedia.com.

Oneota is a designation archaeologists use to refer to a cultural complex that existed in the eastern plains and Great Lakes area of what is now occupied by the United States from around AD 900 to around 1650 or 1700. Based on classification defined in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology, the Oneota culture belongs to formative stage.Gordon R. Willey and Philip Phillips (1957). Method and Theory in American Archaeology. University of Chicago Press. p. 167 . The culture is believed to have transitioned into various Siouan cultures of the protohistoric and historic times, such as the Ioway. A long-accepted ancestry to the Ho-chunk has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Oneota is considered a major component of Upper Mississippian culture. It is characterized by globular, shell-tempered pottery that is often coarse in fibre. Pieces often had a spherical body, short necks and/or a flat lip. Sometimes the vessels had strap handles. Decoration includes wavy and zigzag lines, often in parallel. Most decoration was done on the top half of the vessel.Behm, Jeffrey (2007 April). Oneota Tradition. University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. Oshkosh, WI. Analytically, the culture has been broken down into various stages or horizons. Generally accepted are the following: * Emergent Horizon (c. AD 900-1000), * Developmental Horizon (c. AD 1000-1300), * Classic Horizon (c. AD 1300-1650) (previously called the Oneota Aspect), * Historic Horizon (post- contact, generally after 1650). In addition, the Oneota culture has been divided geographically based on stylistic and socio-economic differences. Some of these traditions are Orr, Langford, and Fisher-Huber. The Oneota diet included corn, beans, and squash, wild rice, nuts, fish, deer, and bison, varying according to the region and locale.Birmingham, Robert A. & Eisenberg, Leslie E. (2000). Indian Mounds of Wisconsin, p. 166. University of Wisconsin Press. Relationships with Middle Mississippian were present but are not yet clearly understood. Whether Oneota developed in situ out of Late Woodland cultures, was invasive, was the result of influence from (proto-)Middle Mississippian peoples, or was some mix of these, is not clear.

The Statutes consist of three legal codes (1529, 1566 and 1588), all written in Ruthenian language, translated into Latin and later Polish. They formed the basis of the legal system of the Grand Duchy. One of the main sources of the statutes was Old Russian Law. First and Second Statutes The main purpose of the First Statute was to standardise and collect various tribal and customary laws in order to codify them as a single document. The First Statute was drafted in 1522 and came into force in 1529 by the initiative of the Lithuanian Council of Lords. It has been proposed that the codification was initiated by Grand Chancellor of Lithuania Miko≈Çaj Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç as a reworking and expansion of the Casimir Code. E. Gudaviƒçius, Stages of the Lithuanian Statute The first edition was redrafted and completed by his successor Albertas Go≈°tautas, who assumed the position of the Grand Chancellor of Lithuania in 1522. The second statute came into effect in 1566 by the order of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund II Augustus, and was larger and more advanced. The Grand Duke did this because of pressure from the Lithuanian nobility, as the expansion of nobles' rights since the publication of the first statute had made it redundant. The second statute was prepared by a special commission, consisting of ten members, appointed by the Grand Duke and the Council of Lords. Third Statute The Third Statute was accepted in 1588 in response to the Union of Lublin, which created the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. The main author and editor of this statute was the great Chancellor of Lithuania Lew Sapieha of Ruthenian origin. The statute was the first one to be printed (in contrast to the handwritten statutes before) in Ruthenian language using Cyrillic alphabet. Translations of the statute were printed in Muscovite Russia and also in Poland, where at that time laws were not thoroughly codified and the Lithuanian statute was consulted in some cases where the corresponding or comparably similar Polish laws were unclear or missing. The statute reorganized and modified existing law, and also included new laws. Novel features included a tendency toward severe penalties, including capital punishment, which was in line with the general reactionary retributive trend in contemporary European law (cf. Malleus Maleficarum). The statute also provided that crimes committed by or against people from different social ranks were punished alike, following the idea of equal worth of human life. Yet the hurdles for a peasant to have a noble tried and convicted were higher than the other way around. The statute was supported by Lithuanian magnates, as it granted them special powers and privileges allowing them to keep the lesser Lithuanian nobility and peasants in check. As a token for being acknowledged as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund III Vasa revised the Union of Lublin and approved the Third Lithuanian Statute. Many features of the statute were not in line with the provisions of the Union of Lublin, which is not at all mentioned in the statute. In this category fall e.g. the provisions about distributing local offices only to native people (or to people who had bought that status). So, too, do the many, detailed provisions about the Lithuanian estates' assemblies which eventually were abolished by the Lublin union treaty. Thus, in everyday legal practice, the statute trumped and even usurped the union treaty. A group often opposing the statute was the Polish nobility, which viewed such inconsistencies as unconstitutional, particularly since the Union of Lublin stipulated that no law could conflict with the law of the Union. The statute, however, in turn, declared the laws that conflicted with itself to be unconstitutional. Statutes of Lithuania were also used in territories of Lithuania annexed by Poland shortly before the Union of Lublin. These conflicts between statutory schemes in Lithuania and Poland persisted for many years. The third variant of the Statute had particularly many humane features, such as: double compensations for killing or hurting a woman; prohibition to enslave a free man for any crime; freedom of religion; and a recommendation to acquit the accused when there is a lack of evidence, instead of punishing the innocent. It was in force in the territory of Lithuania until 1840 when it was replaced by the Russian laws. Until then, many Russian peasants and even nobles (e.g., Andrey Kurbsky) were fleeing from despotism in the neighboring Tsardom of Russia to Lithuania. Implications and developments Copies of the statutes used to be kept in each powiat (district) so they could be used and seen by each person desiring to do so. Attempts by the Lithuanian nobility to limit the power of Lithuanian magnates led to the equalization of laws movement, culminating in the reforms of the election sejm of 1697 (May‚ÄìJune),Volumina Legum Vol. 5, pg. 417 - 421. confirmed in the coronation sejm of September 1697 in the document PorzƒÖdek sƒÖdzenia spraw w Trybunale Wielkiego Ksiƒôstwa Litewskego.Jerzy Malec, Szkice z dziej√≥w federalizmu i my≈õli federalistycznych w czasach nowo≈ºytnych, Wydawnictwo UJ, 1999, Krak√≥w, , Part II, Chapter I Koekwacja praw. Volumina Legum Vol. 6, pg. 12. These reforms limited the jurisdiction and competency of several Lithuanian offices, such as those of the hetman, kanclerz (chancellor), marsza≈Çek (marshal) and podskarbi (under-treasurer), to equate them with those of the corresponding offices in the Polish crown. Many of these offices at the time were held by members of the Sapieha family, and the changes were at least partly made with a view to reducing their power. The reforms also instituted Polish as the administrative language, replacing Ruthenian, in written documents and court proceedings, contradicting the wording of the Third Statute.Pawe≈Ç Jasienica Polska anarchia.Pawe≈Ç Jasienica, Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narod√≥w. Cz. 3. Dzieje Agonii. Pr√≥szynski i S-ka. 2007. Pg. 34 The Statutes of Lithuania were a sign of the progressive European legal tradition, and were cited as precedent in Polish and Livonian courts. Furthermore, they had a major influence on the 1649 encoding of the Russian legal code, Sobornoye Ulozheniye. After forming an association with Poland‚Äîincluding both the dynastic union (1385‚Äì1569) and the confederated Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569‚Äì1795)‚Äîthe Lithuanian Statutes were the Grand Duchy's greatest expression of independence. In 1791, efforts were made to change the system and do away with the privileges of the nobility, creating a constitutional monarchy with a modern citizenry (see Constitution of 3 May). However, these plans came to naught when Russia, abetted by Austria and Prussia, partitioned the Commonwealth, although leaving the Lithuanian Statutes in effect in Lithuania until 1840.

This is one of the 72 arts of the Shaolin Temple. Some martial arts are based on the belief that a correctly trained body can withstand more damage than one that is untrained. Iron Shirt is said to be a series of exercises using many post stances, herbs, qigong and body movements to cause the body's natural energy (qi) to reinforce its structural strength. Practitioners believe that directing energy to parts of the body can reinforce these parts of the body to take blows against them. In the Shaolin version of Iron Shirt, the practitioner would do things such as lying on a stump or supporting tablets of granite on the chest with the goal of toughening the body. Famous practitioners According to 13th generation lineage Tai He (\\"Great Harmony\\") Wudangquan Master Fan Ke Ping (), a collector of rare Kung fu manuals, Zhou Tong, the archery teacher of General Yue Fei, practiced Sh√®nzi bƒÅd√† Q√≠g≈çng ( - \\"Testicle Eight Outstanding Techniques\\").Ancient Martial Arts Manuals Appear in Nanjing (Chinese-English mix) A book of this style supposedly appeared during the Ming Dynasty and was taught on Wudang Mountain.

A folktale called \\"Meeting Zhou Tong By Chance\\" states Zhou Tong was walking down the far side of a tall bridge when he noticed a large young man walking up in his direction while looking down at his own feet. Thinking the young man to be a martial arts master wanting to embarrass Zhou by knocking him off the bridge with a shoulder strike, Zhou prepared for a counter-attack and began to swallow air with a subtle ‚ÄúHm!‚Äù and focused all of his energy to his right shoulder. The skin of his shoulder turned red then purple and became hard as rock underneath his clothing. When the two men brushed shoulders, the young man was nearly knocked off of the bridge and the pain caused saliva to pour from his mouth. The attack left him weak in the knees and one side of his body was completely numb. But the incident was a misunderstanding. The young man was none other than his future student, the Water Margin bandit Wu Song who was looking down at his feet to avoid large water puddles born from a freak rain shower.B√∏rdahl, Vibeke.

Launched as a PC maker, it diversified into IT distribution (CHS Estonia), systems integration (Microlink Systems) and providing of internet services (MicroLink Online) and electronics manufacturing (MicroLink Electronics). The company established itself as the largest Baltic PC maker by mid-1990s. In 1998 the company appointed Allan Martinson as its CEO and merged with the 2nd largest Estonian IT company Astrodata. A period of quick growth ensued, fuelled by 4 private equity rounds from Baltic Investment Fund, Baltic Republics Fund and other players. In 1999-2000 the company grew 5 times by completing 15 mergers and acquisitions, including mergers with the biggest and second-biggest of the Latvian IT companies Fortech and VAR, seven internet service providers across the Baltic region etc. While the corporate headquarters remained in Tallinn, Estonia, the group became essentially pan-Baltic with the largest number of employees and revenues from Latvia. In 1999 the company also launched Delfi, which established itself as the leading news portal in all three Baltic countries. Initially, Delfi was set up as 50:50 joint venture with BNS, the region's leading news agency, but eventually MicroLink bought out its counterpart. Through the merger with Fortech, MicroLink also inherited a majority stake in SAF Tehnika, a Latvian developer and producer of microwave radio links. At its peak, MicroLink employed near 1000 employees and had 60 million EUR in revenues. In 2003-2005 MicroLink sold off its investments. Delfi was sold for 5m EUR to Norwegian company Findexa (resold 3 years later to Estonian Ekspress Grupp for 51m EUR). SAF Tehnika became the first and only listed Baltic stock at Riga Stock Exchange in the IPO that valued the company at 52m EUR. MicroLink Computers was sold to the management and MicroLink Electronics to Amphenol. Finally, MicroLink's core IT business was sold to three Baltic telecom companies (Eesti Telekom, Lattelecom and Teo LT). in a deal exceeding 20m EUR. Soon after this sale, MicroLink's Lithuanian arm was sold by Lithuanian telecom TEO.LT to MTVP venture capital company and part of the Latvian operations - the leading local ERP software maker FMS - to the management. The last CEO of independent MicroLink was JƒÅnis Bergs who took the post over in 2004. By 2011, both Latvian and Estonian telecoms had merged MicroLink with their core operations and MicroLink ceased to exist both as a brand and an independent corporate entity. The Lithuanian MicroLink was named Hostex and sold back to Teo LT in 2010. Microlink business interests included: system integration and infrastructure solutions, software development, ERP and business solutions, IT consulting and training, central systems and datacentre solutions and end-user PC services and support.

Background In March 1848, the city of Milan launched an uprising against Austrian occupation. Charles Albert supported the Milanese revolt and declared war on Austria. Venice also declared its independence from Austria. The Austrian Field Marshal Radetzky withdrew his forces from Milan to the defensive positions based on the four fortresses known as the Quadrilateral: Verona, Mantua, Peschiera, and Legnago. The Piedmontese took Peschiera after a short siege, but Radetzky received substantial reinforcements. Battle Around 15 July, the Piedmontese Army was widely dispersed on the war theatre, from the Rivoli plateau on the north to Governolo on the south. Marshal Radetzky attacked, on July 23, the Piedmontese II Corps (commanded by General ), and forced it to retire first before Peschiera and then, after another successful attack on the 24th, behind the river Mincio, separating the Piedmontese Army in two.Pieri, p. 236-41 The Piedmontese High Command reacted slowly and uncertainly to the news coming from the north, and eventually it was decided to attack the Austrian army in the rear towards the village of Staffalo, with the bulk of the I Corps (led by General Eusebio Bava); the attack, begun in the afternoon of the 24th, was successful and the single brigade which covered this area was forced to retreat. However, this lulled the Sardinian commanders into a false sense of complacency, and spurred Radetzky to stop his advance beyond the Mincio and march on these enemy forces.Pieri, p. 241-3 For the 25th, the Piedmontese were ordered to attack the enemy further in the area, while the II Corps was instructed to support the attack from the Mincio (however General De Sonnaz refused to obey the order, claiming that his troops were too tired); but what was supposed to be an offensive soon turned into a desperate battle to hold the advancing enemy. For the whole day, the outnumbered Piedmontese were subjected by attacks by two Austrian army corps, and by the end of the day the whole line had been forced to move back; however, the retreat was done in an orderly way and with the men fighting.Pieri, p. 243-7 Aftermath While not a total victory (in fact, the Austrians had suffered higher losses than the Piedmontese and all major Piedmontese units kept their cohesion and their equipment), the spirit of King Charles Albert and of his generals was all but broken. Although initially intending to counterattack, the retreat behind the Mincio would stop only at Milano. After a small battle at the outskirts of the city, an armistice (originally of six weeks and then prorogued) was signed, and the Piedmontese Army retreated within the borders of the Kingdom of Sardinia. The attempt to renew the war effort the next year resulted in another victory for Radetzky and the effective end of the First Italian War of Independence. The Austrian marshal returned all the rebellious provinces to Austrian rule.

It is down the line from London Charing Cross. The station and all trains serving it are operated by Southeastern. It is also the nearest station to the Kentish village of Lamberhurst, away: an infrequent bus service (four to five journeys each way on Mondays to Saturdays) links Frant station with Lamberhurst.  History  The station was opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) at the same time as the route, in 1851, and the original station building, which is situated on the Down (eastern) side of the line, remains in use. Designed by the company's architect, Wiliam Tress, and built of local ragstone in a Gothic lodge style, with a canopy added in 1905, it has been a Grade II listed building since 1982. The platforms are staggered: a common arrangement at early SER stations which allowed passengers to cross the line in relative safety behind two trains stopped at the station, although today the platforms are connected by a footbridge. From the 1960s until 1986, the station was served only at peak times on week days. However, since 1986, when the line was electrified, it has been served seven days a week.

Its route is in length and encircles most of the park, with train stations in three different park areas. The rail line, constructed by WED Enterprises, operates with four historic steam locomotives originally built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's main line loop. On a typical day, the railroad has two trains in operation; on busy days, it has three trains. The WDWRR's development was led by Roger E. Broggie, who also oversaw the construction of the Disneyland Railroad in Disneyland in Anaheim, California. The attraction's locomotives were acquired from the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucat√°n, a narrow-gauge railroad system in Mexico. After being shipped to the United States, they were altered to resemble locomotives built in the 1880s and restored to operating condition. Each locomotive was also given a set of passenger cars, which were built from scratch. The WDWRR opened to the public for the first time on October 1, 1971, the same day that the Magic Kingdom park opened. Since then, the WDWRR has become one of the world's most popular steam-powered railroads, with about 3.7 million passengers each year. The WDWRR closed temporarily on December 3, 2018, due to the construction of the Tron Lightcycle Run roller coaster attraction near the Tomorrowland section. History =Discovery in Mexico= A typical alt=A black-and-white image of an old steam locomotive and tender The development of the Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR) from the late 1960s to its opening in 1971 was overseen by Roger E. Broggie, vice president and general manager of Mapo, Inc., WED Enterprises' research and manufacturing branch.. Broggie previously supervised the building of the Disneyland Railroad in Disneyland in Anaheim, California.. From his experience with the railroad at Disneyland, Broggie determined that it was better to use existing steam locomotives, rather than building them entirely from scratch like the Disneyland Railroad's first two locomotives. To this end, he contacted rail historian Gerald M. Best who informed him that locomotives could be obtained at a railroad boneyard in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico, owned by the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucat√°n... This was a narrow-gauge system, the same gauge as the Disneyland Railroad. Broggie, along with fellow Disney employee and railroad- building expert Earl Vilmer, went to M√©rida in 1969 to investigate. They determined that four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works could potentially be salvaged, along with a fifth locomotive built by Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which was in front of the railroad company's headquarters. Broggie paid a total of US$32,750 for all five locomotives ($8,000 for each of the four locomotives in the boneyard plus an additional $750 for the fifth locomotive).. The locomotives, along with an assortment of brass fittings and other spare parts given away for free, were immediately shipped by rail back to the United States.. =Restoration in Florida= The five locomotives and spare parts acquired by Roger Broggie were sent to the Tampa Ship Repair & Dry Dock Company in Tampa, Florida, to receive the aesthetic and mechanical restorations necessary to run on the planned WDWRR. At the time, this was the closest facility to the Walt Disney World site in Bay Lake, Florida with the space and equipment needed to accommodate full-size railroad rolling stock. Here, Transportation Superintendent Earl Vilmer, who had accompanied Broggie on his trip to Mexico, along with Project Engineer Bob Harpur and the facility's Machinist Supervisor George Britton, were tasked with the project's completion... The general idea for the restoration was to make the locomotives appear as if they were built in the 1880s. The original, dilapidated boilers of the four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works were replaced with new, smaller boilers built by Dixon Boiler Works.. Their worn-out wood and steel cabs were replaced with new ones made of fiberglass, and they were given new tenders, which used the trucks from the originals. Many of the smaller original parts on the locomotives such as the domes and brass bells on top of the boilers, the wheels, and the side rods were successfully refurbished and retained. The locomotives' fireboxes were also modified to burn diesel oil. Replicas of their builder plates were also made to replace the originals.. The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works locomotive acquired along with them could not be restored. Built in 1902, this locomotive was the oldest of the five locomotives purchased and was determined to have too many problems to be rebuilt. It was stored out of use in California for a period before being sold to an unknown locomotive broker. Some of its parts were used to help restore the four Baldwin locomotives, including its smokestack, which was fitted to the WDWRR's No. 4 locomotive.. =Opening to present day= The restoration of the WDWRR's four locomotives, as well as the construction of five new open-air Narragansett-style excursion cars for each of them (twenty in total), was completed in less than two years.. The first completed set of five passenger cars was delivered to the Magic Kingdom park during April 1971 and the first completed locomotive arrived on May 15, 1971, several months before the park's opening.. Like the steam trains running on the Disneyland Railroad during Disneyland's opening day on July 17, 1955, the steam trains for the WDWRR were the first attraction in the Magic Kingdom park to be finished, and they have been operating in the park ever since it opened on October 1, 1971.. George Britton, who was instrumental in getting the WDWRR's locomotives refurbished, became the railroad's foreman from the time the railroad opened until his retirement on April 6, 2006. The WDWRR would eventually become one of the most popular steam-powered railroads in the world with about 3.7 million passengers each year. For the first few months after the WDWRR opened to the public, Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, modeled after the former Victorian-style Saratoga Springs station in Saratoga Springs, New York, was the only stop for passengers along its route, making only complete round trips possible.. On May 1, 1972, the first Frontierland Station opened just northwest of Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn and Caf√© in the Frontierland section on the park's western edge.. It was one of the last changes made to the WDWRR prior to the retirement of Roger Broggie on October 1, 1973.. Frontierland Station was demolished in November 1990 to make way for the new Splash Mountain attraction and was replaced by the current Frontierland Station, which opened in December 1991 just north of the original station site. During construction of the Splash Mountain attraction and the current Frontierland Station, the WDWRR was temporarily renamed Backtrack Express and operated a single train, which only traveled back and forth along the section of track between the Main Street, U.S.A. section and the Mickey's Starland section. Between 1976 and 1977, the Auto-Train Corporation sponsored the WDWRR.. alt=A circus-themed train station prior to its transformation into an old-fashioned train station The WDWRR's third station, Mickey's Birthdayland Station, opened on June 18, 1988, in the Magic Kingdom park's brand-new Mickey's Birthdayland section adjacent to the Fantasyland section in the park's northeast corner, and the railroad was briefly renamed Mickey's Birthdayland Express to promote it. When the Mickey's Birthdayland section was renamed Mickey's Starland in 1990 and Mickey's Toontown Fair in 1996, the signage for its WDWRR station changed both times, but the station's structure remained the same.. In 2004, the station was demolished and completely rebuilt with an identical appearance to the original station. On February 11, 2011, the Mickey's Toontown Fair section closed to make way for the new Storybook Circus area, part of a new expansion of the Fantasyland section. The current Fantasyland Station, built on the site of the former Mickey's Toontown Fair Station, opened on March 12, 2012. In April 2012, the water tower and maintenance buildings adjacent to Fantasyland Station were re-themed to match the station's new design. On December 3, 2018, the WDWRR temporarily closed to accommodate construction of the Tron Lightcycle Run roller coaster attraction in the Tomorrowland section. Ride experience The WDWRR's alt=A water tower adjacent to railroad track Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station adjacent to the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, the trains of the WDWRR travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's main line, and on any given day, either two or three trains run, with two running on a typical day.. Each train is operated by an engineer and fireman in the locomotive, as well as a conductor at the rear of the train who supervises the passengers. As the train departs Main Street, U.S.A. Station, it crosses an access road in the Adventureland section, travels over a small bridge, enters a small tunnel, then crosses a second access road in the Frontierland section.. After entering a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log flume attraction, the train stops at Frontierland Station. Continuing down the line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster attraction and traverses a fully functional swing bridge, which crosses a canal connecting the Rivers of America to a dry dock area... This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway.. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.. In the final segment of the train's journey around the park, it climbs a two-percent grade through the Tomorrowland section, passes the Space Mountain roller coaster attraction, and travels over a small bridge before it arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station.. This completes what the park refers to as The Grand Circle Tour. File:WDWRR - Main Street, U.S.A.

Since 1999, a separately-priced tour of the WDWRR named Disney's The Magic Behind Our Steam Trains Tour has been available once daily, and includes access to the railroad's otherwise-restricted roundhouse. Rolling stock alt=The back of a locomotive tender with the inside of the locomotive's cab partially visible When working on the line, each WDWRR locomotive consumes of fuel and of water per hour, and each tender can hold of fuel and of water.. In the past, all four locomotives received overhauls at the Tweetsie Railroad in Blowing Rock, North Carolina. Each of the four locomotives pulls a set of five passenger cars with seating capacity for 75 passengers per car, for a total of 375 passengers per train. Steam-driven generators at the rear of the tenders supply electricity to the locomotives and passenger cars.. The locomotives do not contain brakes, but the passenger cars do. {Class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" +Walt Disney World Railroad rolling stock details.. !scope=\\"col\\"Number !scope=\\"col\\"Name !scope=\\"col\\"Namesake !scope=\\"col\\"Image !scope=\\"col\\"Wheel arrangement !scope=\\"col\\"Date built !scope=\\"col\\"Builder !scope=\\"col\\"Serial number !scope=\\"col\\"Passenger cars !scope=\\"col\\"Date entered service !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25%;\\"Notes - !scope=\\"row\\"1 Walter E.

They are also used to notify WDWRR personnel when Big Thunder Mountain Railroad's transfer track is swung over the WDWRR's track to transfer trains on and off the roller coaster. The WDWRR's track is divided into seven such segments, or blocks, and each block has a track-side block signal to communicate its status.. Block signals are located at each of the three stations, alongside the three main-line blocks between the stations, and alongside the spur line connecting the WDWRR's roundhouse to the main line. {Class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" +Walt Disney World Railroad block signal light details !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25%;\\"Block signal light color(s) !scope=\\"col\\"Meaning !scope=\\"col\\"Action needed (when two trains are operating) !scope=\\"col\\"Action needed - !scope=\\"row\\"20px Red Next block is occupied Stop Stop - !scope=\\"row\\" Red + yellow Next two blocks are occupied Stop Stop - !scope=\\"row\\" Yellow + green Next block is clear, but following block is occupied Stop Proceed to next block - !scope=\\"row\\"20px Green Next two blocks are clear Proceed to next block Proceed to next block } See also *Hogwarts Express (Universal Orlando Resort) *Rail transport in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts *TECO Line Streetcar References Bibliography  * External links 1971 establishments in Florida 3 ft gauge railways in the United States Fantasyland Frontierland Heritage railroads in Florida Magic Kingdom Main Street, U.S.A.

During the boiling of soy milk, in an open shallow pan, a film or skin forms on the liquid surface. The films are collected and dried into yellowish sheets known as tofu skin. Since tofu skin is not produced using a coagulant, it is not technically a proper tofu; however, it does have similar texture and flavor to some tofu products. Tofu skin's use was first documented in written records in China, Korea, and Japan in the sixteenth century. It is widely used, fresh, fermented, or dried, in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese cuisine. Early history An early written reference to tofu skin appeared in 1587 in Japan in the Matsuya Hisamatsu chakai-ki [Three-generation diary of the Matsuya's family's tea ceremonies]. The writer, Matsuya Hisamasa, states simply that tofu skin is the film that forms atop soymilk. Other written references to tofu skin appeared around that time in China in the Bencao Gangmu [The great pharmacopoeia] by Li Shizhen. This work was completed in 1578, but not published until 1596. Chapter 25 states: A third known reference to tofu skin appears in 1695 in Japan in the Ben Zhao Shi Jian (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Pen Chao Shih Chien [A Mirror of Food in This Dynasty, 12 volumes]. This book was written by Hitomi Hitsudai in Japan, in Chinese. When Japanese read the Chinese characters for tofu skin, doufu-lao, they pronounce them t≈çfu no uba. Lao or uba means \\"old woman\\" or \\"wet nurse\\". Preparation A worker at a tofu skin factory skimming the skin from small buckets and drying them Tofu skin may be purchased in fresh or dried form. In the latter case, the tofu skin is rehydrated in water before use. It is often used to wrap dim sum. Because of its slightly rubbery texture, tofu skin is also manufactured in bunched, folded and wrapped forms that are used as meat substitutes in vegetarian cuisine. Tofu skins can be wrapped and then folded against itself to make d√≤u ba≈ç (, literally \\"tofu package\\"). These are often fried to give it a firmer skin before being cooked further. Forms Making tofu skin by skimming the skin off hot soymilk =Fresh, half-dried, and dried= These are the three basic forms. Each comes in many varieties. =Dried yuba sticks or Fuzhu= Yuba may also be dried and sold as dried yuba sticks (, lit. tofu bamboo). By layering or bunching fresh yuba or rehydrated yuba, then tying it tightly in cloth and stewing it, the dried yuba sticks will retain their original shape. This bunched tofu skin is then called tofu chicken (; or ). In Thai cooking it is referred to as fawng dt√¢o-h√ªu (, lit. foam tofu). =Meat alternatives= By layering and bunching the sheets in a certain manner, an imitation of chicken breast can be created with yuba. The effect is completed by frying the \\"skin\\" side of the tofu chicken until it is crispy. If stuffed with vegetables, it becomes tofu duck. Likewise various other meat alternatives have been made in this way, especially by Buddhist vegetarian restaurants in areas of Chinese culture. The world's first meat analogs were developed in China, probably by Buddhist cooks in temples and monasteries. The earliest process for making these meatless meats consisted of rolling thin sheets of doufupi, literally tofu skin, around a filling of minced, smoked, or other seasoned pieces of tofu skin, tying closed the bundle with string, and steaming until a meaty texture and flavor developed. =Log= Other methods include rolling the tofu skin tightly on a chopstick and steaming the tofu skin to form a log. When the log is sliced, each slice will be circular in form with a square hole in the center, which looks like old Chinese coins.

The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls. Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \\"discovered\\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \\"Mama in the Movies\\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full- length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States. The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others.

There are 4,250 licensed AAT accountants providing accountancy, tax and business advisory services to more than 400,000 British businesses. 80% of the FTSE 100 employ an AAT apprentice within their finance function. AAT was created in 1980 by the Institute of Accounting Staff (then a subsidiary of ACCA) and the Association of Technicians in Finance and Accounting (then a subsidiary of CIPFA). It is a technician level qualification offering higher apprenticeships which entitles those who have completed the exams and obtained relevant supervised work experience to become an accounting technician. The AAT is based at 140 Aldersgate Street, London but has 43 branches across the UK with representation in the rest of the world including Hong Kong, Botswana and South Africa.  Professional recognition  The body was sponsored by four UK chartered accountancy bodies; CIPFA, ICAEW, CIMA and ICAS from 1980 until May 2017. After this date, ICAEW, CIPFA, CIMA and ICAS no longer participated in AAT‚Äôs governance structure and AAT took the decision to bring their sponsoring body partnerships to a close. A strong relationship remains between AAT and its former sponsoring bodies, albeit on a more operational basis, with exemptions for the chartered qualifications remaining at the heart of those relationships. https://www.aat.org.uk/aats- governance-structure The AAT became a full member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) in 2012.IFAC Membership Retrieved August 1, 2018  Versus CAT  Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) used to be a sponsor of the AAT but broke away in order to form a rival qualification called the Certified Accounting Technician (CAT) award. The ACCA implemented this policy as it wanted a technician level qualification that offered accountancy apprenticeships based on the same business model as itself.  In Scotland  The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland is also keen to implement AAT courses into its own business model. It presently has no plans to develop an ICAS technician qualification in direct competition with the AAT's UK model as proposed in the late 1990s..  In South Africa  The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants decided to sponsor the AAT program offering higher apprenticeship accounting courses and it has expanded since 2011. AAT(SA) has no signatory powers for any of its South African members, this is because there is not sufficient audit content within the qualification offered. SAICA and AAT are working towards gaining authority in a number of other areas, such as Commissioner of Oaths and review status. This sort of authority does take time to approve and the new South African Company Legislation is not yet finalised.  Examinations  Since 2010 every level of the AAT qualification has a number of modules, each of which culminate in a computer based assessment.  Qualifications  The AAT Intermediate Level 3 qualification or Level 6 in Scotland, is approved for the University entrance system with a value of 160 UCAS tariff points. This is also included in the KS5 performance tables. The final AAT qualification, the AAT Advanced Level is equivalent to QCF Level 4 and SCQF Level 8. Accounting Technicians, when certified as being experienced and competently qualified, can perform identical tasks to Chartered accountants with the exception of not being permitted to sign off company audits. This is largely irrelevant for AAT licensed accountants as their client base is almost exclusively formed of micro and small businesses who enjoy the small company audit exemption (employing less than 50 employees with a turnover below ¬£10.1m or assets below ¬£5.1m). AAT also licenses ATOL reporting accountants although it only has a small number of such members. In 2014 AAT expanded its suite of qualifications and launched new courses in accounting, bookkeeping, computerised accounting, tax and business skills. In 2017, AAT also launched a new membership category for bookkeepers (AATQB). =Employer accreditation= The AAT employer accreditation scheme recognises employers with a positive and planned approach to the professional development of their AAT members, whether through studying for an AAT qualification or, once qualified, supporting them in their continuing professional development. AAT Accredited Employer Scheme provides the employer with a range of benefits including: * Full and fellow members will automatically meet their mandatory CPD requirements by following their employer's training and development processes * Support in managing student member's * Advice on trainee recruitment and funding * AAT Accredited Employer logo and certificate.

Patrick Stephens Ltd, Cambridge. the line connecting with Hastings having been opened by the SER on 13 February 1851, and which initially gave the Brighton, Lewes and Hastings Railway access to the latter town. A large station building was provided on the Down side, along with a signal box at the south end of the Down platform. Robertsbridge became a junction in 1900 with the opening of the Rother Valley Light Railway to Tenterden. The line was extended to Headcorn in 1905, and was renamed the Kent and East Sussex Railway. In 1954 all regular passenger services were withdrawn and the line beyond Tenterden Town was completely closed. The line to Tenterden continued to be used by freight services and occasional special passenger trains (e.g. hop pickers trains) until closed by British Railways on 12 June 1961. About half a mile length of line remained in use as a siding to serve Hodsons Mill on the outskirts of Robertsbridge until 1970.The bay platform, on the Down (eastern) side of the station, is still in place and used for engineers trains. A railway preservation society, the Rother Valley Railway, have built a new separate station named Robertsbridge Junction on the east side of the car park, and have rebuilt the line from here to Northbridge Street. The first train on this rebuilt section ran in September 2013. They have plans to rebuild the rest of the route eastwards to join up with the Kent and East Sussex Railway and restore services along the line. (Steam trains already run on another section of the line, between Tenterden Town and Bodiam, 3¬Ω miles from Robertsbridge.)

Biography =Early life and education= He received his elementary education at Academia Santa Monica in Santurce, a district of San Juan. For his secondary education, he attended St. Joseph Seraphic Minor Seminary in Callicoon, New York. He then studied at and graduated from Siena College in Loudonville, New York. Formally accepted as a candidate for the Franciscan Order at Christ House in Lafayette, New Jersey, in 1970, the following year he entered the novitiate of the Order at St. Francis Friary in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he professed his first vows in 1972. Gonz√°lez earned the degree of Master of Sacred Theology at the Washington Theological Coalition (now Washington Theological Union) in Silver Spring, Maryland. He also holds a doctorate in sociology from Fordham University. He authored The Hispanic Catholic in the United States: a Socio-Cultural and Religious Profile. He has received an honorary doctorate from the Graduate Theological Foundation in South Bend, Indiana. =Priesthood= On May 8, 1977, Gonz√°lez was ordained a priest, and, in 1982, he was assigned to serve at St. Pius V Parish in the South Bronx, before going to Holy Cross Church, also in the Bronx. In 1986, he was appointed pastor of that parish. He remained there until 1988. =Auxiliary Bishop of Boston= On July 19, 1988, he was named by the Holy See as an auxiliary bishop of the Boston, serving under Cardinal Bernard Francis Law. Gonz√°lez became popular with the Hispanic community of the region. =Bishop of Corpus Christi= On May 16, 1995, Gonz√°lez was appointed as coadjutor bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi, in which post he served until 1997, when he succeeded as bishop of the diocese. As in Boston, Gonz√°lez Nieves was very popular with the Hispanic community. =Archbishop of San Juan= On March 26, 1999, Gonz√°lez Nieves was appointed archbishop of San Juan by Pope John Paul II. He was installed as archbishop on May 8 in a ceremony that was attended by many of his friends from Corpus Christi, New York and Boston. Other people who attended included the then mayor of San Juan and future Governor of Puerto Rico Sila Calder√≥n, former Governor Carlos Romero Barcel√≥, as well as other Puerto Rican political figures. The ceremony also marked the retirement of Cardinal Luis Aponte Mart√≠nez, who had been the Archbishop of San Juan since 1965. Aponte Mart√≠nez observed that the ceremony marked the first time in history that a Puerto Rican archbishop had handed the see over to another Puerto Rican archbishop. Almost immediately, Gonz√°lez Nieves raised his profile across the island. As archbishop, he has articulated outspoken and often controversial views, particularly in defense of the Navy-Vieques protests and in his denunciation of homosexuality, among other things. His actions in the Vieques Protests have gained international notoriety, and he has been viewed as a strong Latin- American leader of the Catholic Church. He has proclaimed his pride in being Puerto Rican, asked the Government to work hard to preserve the national identity of Puerto Ricans, and criticized political corruption in Puerto Rico. During the spring of 2006, along with several Protestant leaders, he was instrumental in persuading Governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√°, Senate President Kenneth McClintock, and House Speaker Jos√© Aponte Hern√°ndez to resolve Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis, which had sparked a two-week-long government shutdown. In 2009, there was speculation that Pope Benedict XVI might name Gonz√°lez Nieves as the Archbishop of New York to replace Cardinal Edward Egan. (That appointment went to Timothy Dolan.)

Ball, which covers grades 9 through 12, is a part of Galveston Independent School District. Ball High School serves the cities of Galveston and Jamaica Beach and the unincorporated communities of Port Bolivar and Crystal Beach on the Bolivar Peninsula. The school mascot is the Tornado, named \\"Tuffy Tor.\\" Currently, there are 5000+ students attending the school. History =Founding= In 1881, the citizens of Galveston, authorized by the legislative act of 1879 which specified that all cities of a certain size could initiate and maintain their own school system, organized a public school district and elected a board of trustees. Some 20 teachers were employed to teach students in grades one through seven. Prior to this time, all education in Galveston was private or parochial. In the summer of 1883, a local dry goods businessman, George Ball, communicated his intention to support the establishment of a public high school in Galveston via a brief and simple note to the Galveston City Council. It read: \\"If the authorities of this city will furnish appropriate and sufficient grounds centrally located, I will contribute $50,000 for the erection of a building to be permanently dedicated to the use of the public free schools of the City of Galveston...I will be pleased to carry [this proposal] into the earliest effect with the hope that it may prove useful to the community with which I have been long identified and whose future welfare I most earnestly desire.\\" Ball's offer was accepted, and the cornerstone for what would become Ball High School in Galveston was laid on February 15, 1884. Contrary to custom, which places the cornerstone in the northeast corner of the building, it was placed at the southwest corner of the main portion of the building. It is a block of Dupree stone, upon the open sides of which are carved simply the words, \\"George Ball to the Children of Galveston.\\" Articles placed in the cornerstone included photos of Mr. and Mrs. George Ball, autographs of the children attending public schools, the city directory, photos of the teachers, and a floor plan of Ball High School. Ball died on March 11, 1884, without seeing his gift completed. The new public high school in Galveston opened its doors to 200 pupils on October 1, 1884, with a building consisting of 12 classrooms, two offices and an auditorium, and with the motto \\"Best school south of St. Louis and west of the Mississippi.\\" On March 4, 1886, the school was named in memory of its benefactor. =Early years= right The Class of 1887 represented the first graduating class of Ball High School. The school served students in grades eight through twelve. Early curriculum for Ball High School students included English, history, algebra, arithmetic, physical geography, Latin, civil government, trigonometry, physics, political economy, chemistry, mental philosophy and physiology. In 1890, Mrs. George Ball spent $47,000 to remodel, enlarge and beautify the building, which bore her husband's name. At this time, the Rotunda and Dome were added to the north front of the building. In September 1900, the great hurricane struck and Ball High School was not spared from the fury of its waves and wind. The west wall slipped; the roof blew off; plaster crumbled; windowpanes crashed; and the metal covering was stripped from the ball of the dome, showing its skeleton of steel ribs. In the storm's aftermath, citizens of the City of Galveston contributed and raised the $45,000 required to repair the high school and the other Galveston schools and also to pay the teacher's salaries. Because of the devastating loss of life and property during the storm, school attendance decreased by some 25 percent, creating an excess of teachers. Other Texas communities came to the rescue in many ways, perhaps most importantly by providing jobs to these Galveston teachers whose services were no longer needed in the island community. While Ball High School was undergoing massive repair, students reported to the campus known as the \\"K\\" school, today the site of San Jacinto Elementary School. By the fall of 1901, all classes were again held at the Ball High building. The school population had increased dramatically by 1915, and two wings were added to the building to accommodate the many students. The six new classrooms eased the overcrowding for a time, but by 1924 overcrowding was again a problem for students and faculty. The wings, added in 1915, were now extended in order to provide additional classroom space. For the next 30 years, no additions or improvements were made to the building on 21st and Ball Avenue. The main Ball High School building, remodeled and expanded still stands today and houses the home offices of the American Indemnity Company. =New location= Ball High School Today Bill Cherry wrote in a 2004 Galveston County Daily News article that, by the 1950s, Ball High School \\"was not only horribly congested, but the building was in deplorable condition, the victim of years and years of deferred maintenance.\\" In 1954, the Ball High School complex moved to its new location, constructed in 1952,Galveston ISD at 41st street and Avenue O. This building cost $3.2 million and covered a four- square block area-41st to 43rd Streets and Avenue O to Avenue P. The new location received additions and renovations in 1964, 1974, 1981, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2004, and 2005. In the late 1960s, Ball high merged with Central High School, the first black high school in Texas, founded in 1885. This reorganization created the need for the expansion of the high school into the former Sam Houston Junior High School facility at 4116 Avenue N-1/2, two blocks from the main high school structure, at 4115 Avenue O, to create the two-campus Ball High School. The original campus is often referred to as Ball High South, while the former Sam Houston campus was familiarly known as Ball High North. Central school became a middle school. In the late 1970s, the Central school campus became an eight grade school which served exclusively eighth grade students throughout the school district. Years later, additional remodeling of the South campus combined with reduced enrollments resulted in consolidating the high school at one facility. The North campus reverted to an elementary school, renamed for the late Charles B. Scott, a long-time Ball High School counselor. In 1968 Central High School, the high school for African-Americans, consolidated into Ball High School. With the closure of Central High Ball High became a very early social experiment for complete school integration and busing. While there were rumblings in the community around the unacceptability of integration, integration worked at Ball High School. Much of the reason for integration's success was due to the success of the integrated athletics teams. Multiple conference and state titles were won during the early seventies and as a result the community rallied behind Ball High School quickly. Leadership on the sports teams was critical to assure that teammates stayed focused on winning and kept the black-white issue completely buried. In the mid-1970s, a state-of-the-art media center was added at Ball High South campus and air-conditioning was installed for the first time. The forty-year-old school received a major $1.5 million renovation and update in 1980. The most recent repairs, in 2004 and 2005, were made possible through school bonds which were in political standstill for seven years. In the 2000s, rising real estate costs in Galveston forced many families to move to other areas, including League City, Texas City, and La Marque. This meant an exodus of children from the Galveston ISD and into other school districts. If Hurricane Katrina evacuees and out-of-district students are excluded, Galveston ISD lost 12% of its students between the 2002-2003 school year and the 2006-2007 school year; Ball High School is affected as it is the only public high school in Galveston. () Dress code On September 3, 1969, the GISD superintendent approved a proposed Ball High School dress code that was drafted by a committee consisting of the school principal, the associate principal, students, and faculty members chosen by the students. This committee deliberately allowed an amount of vagueness to balance free expression and the ability to enforce the code. It allowed students to have facial hair while many American high school dress codes at the time did not. This code was in effect in addition to the general GISD dress code, which was issued by the GISD superintendent in March 1967.Wilson, Steven Harmon.

The Prime Minister is the most powerful figure in Ethiopian politics and commander in chief of the Ethiopian Armed Forces. The official residence of the prime minister, is Menelik Palace in Addis Ababa. The current Prime Minister is Abiy Ahmed of the Prosperity Party who is the 10th person to be the head of government of Ethiopia and the fourth Prime Minister since the new constitution formed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a parliamentary republic with the President as head of state and the Prime Minister as head of government. However, unlike in most parliamentary republics, the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia explicitly vests executive power in the Council of Ministers and names the Prime Minister as chief executive, with the President limited to an almost entirely ceremonial role. The Prime Minister is elected from the members of the House of Representatives.Article 73(1) Constitution of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia The nominee then presents a government platform and must receive a vote of confidence in order to become prime minister. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the largest party in the House of Peoples' Representatives. Origins and history The heads of government of Ethiopia have been Chief Ministers (1909‚Äì1943), and then Prime Ministers (1943‚Äìpresent). Since 1995 Ethiopia follows a Parliamentary system of government. The Prime Minister's position is stronger on paper than his counterparts in other parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system. In most other parliamentary systems, the head of state or his or her official representative (i.e., the monarch or president or governor-general) is nominal chief executive, but in practice is bound to act on the advice of the prime minister. Thus, the head of state de facto holds a purely ceremonial position, while the prime minister is the actual head of government, chief executive, and leading political figure. In Ethiopia, however, the Prime Minister is both de jure and de facto chief executive. The prime minister is expected to become a member of the House of Peoples' Representatives within six months of beginning their tenure, if they are not a member already. The prime minister is expected to work with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the legislature. Role and power of the prime minister After each election, the President of Ethiopia invites the leader of the majority party or coalition in the House of Peoples' Representatives to form a government at the federal level and exercise its powers. In practice the prime minister nominates the cabinet ministers. The prime minister is also the commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian National Defense Force. The prime minister, in consultation with the Cabinet, schedules and attends the sessions of the Houses of Parliament and is required to answer the question from the Members of Parliament to them as the in-charge of the portfolios in the capacity as Prime Minister of Ethiopia. The prime minister represents the country in various delegations, high level meetings and international organisations that require the attendance of the highest government office. Security The bodyguards of the Ethiopian Prime Minister are equipped with the TAR-21 assault rifle.

Despite its size, Tweed Volcano was not a supervolcano; other shield volcanoes--such as in the Hawaiian Islands--are much larger.

Its erosion caldera is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.the Caldera of the Tweed Volcano.  Volcanic stratigraphy  Lavas from the Tweed Volcano are recognised as part of the Lamington Volcanics.Geoscience Australia Lamington Volcanics Stratigraphy The volcanic stratigraphy of the Tweed Volcano is similar to many other hotspot volcanoes around the world. Eruptions of tholeiitic and some calc-alkaline basalts are the oldest recognised units derived from the volcano. These are named the Lismore Basalt and Beechmont Basalt in New South Wales and Queensland respectively. There are numerous flows recorded which may have been erupted irregularly as fossil soil (Paleosol) profiles and lacustrine type rock units are occasionally found within the rock unit. Following eruption of the Lismore/Beechmont Basalt a period of eruption of rhyolite lavas took place. Eruptions occurred in lava and some pyroclastic forms. These rhyolites are known in New South Wales as the Nimbin Rhyolite and Queensland as the Binna Burra Rhyolite. Following eruption of this rhyolite a period of basaltic volcanism resumed (or continued) with the eruption of the Blue Knob (NSW)/Hobwee (QLD) Basalt. The erosion of the volcano has resulted in the exposure of the central feeders of the volcano. These are most evident as Mount Warning and Mount Nullum, though there are numerous other volcanic vents identified all around the region as far away as Nimbin in New South Wales and Spring Mount in Queensland. The central volcanic area in the vicinity of Mount Warning and Mount Nullum is known as the Mount Warning Central Complex and is composed of intrusive rocks including syenite, peralkaline granite, microgranite, monzonite, dolerite, as well as some hyperbassal and volcanic rocks such as rhyolite and basalt.

Now headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, AFA was established to encourage and promote the practice and belief of astrology through research, teaching, lecturing and practice. Ernest and Catharine Grant were its founders. AFA was originally named The American Federation of Scientific Astrologers, in keeping with the European trend of the time which was the result of a strong intellectual movement within the ranks of astrologers in Europe towards the establishment of astrology as a respected science. However, the name was changed to the American Federation of Astrologers in the mid-1940s. The AFA has been active on several different levels since its inception, including the hosting of a periodic astrological conferences. The AFA was the first U.S. astrological organization to administer certification examinations for astrologers, a program which it continues to sponsor. It is also a publisher of astrological books and has a world-class library of astrological literature and journals. AFA publishes astrological texts, primarily for intermediate and advanced astrologers, which are available for sale to members and non-members, both directly from AFA and through many bookstores. AFA also publishes a monthly journal, Today's Astrologer, which is distributed to the general membership. There are various categories of membership available and open to anyone: Associate and Research. Members located outside the United States pay higher dues as international members to compensate for the greater cost of postage, while those 65 and older pay reduced dues as senior members. Research members pay a higher level of fees, and additionally receive a separate journal called the AFA Journal of Research, which specializes in articles of relevance to astrological research. It is published periodically. Neither Today's Astrologer nor the Journal of Research is available for sale to non-members. In earlier years, the AFA also published an annual Yearbook consisting of the transcripts of all the papers presented at its annual conferences. This large, substantial publication began in 1939 and was issued annually until 1942, then more sporadically in later years, appearing again in 1944, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1950, 1952 and 1954. Copies have now become very scarce. In the late 1940s, the AFA also issued a series of numbered publications called Research Bulletins, each of which addressed a single research topic. These ranged in theme from Astrological Americana to Angioma, and apart from Astrological Americana, which remains common, most of them have become scarce. The AFA's most prominent activity as a publisher, however, has been in the publication of astrological books. Especially from the 1970s to the present day, it has been one of the leading publishers of astrological literature in the world, and has also reprinted many otherwise out-of-print and often very scarce works from the early 20th century in high- quality new editions, as well as translations of Morin's Astrologica Gallica, first published in the 17th century.

Ancient and medieval Adjara  Artifacts of the Colchian culture at the Gonio museum. A medieval arch bridge at Makhuntseti. Archeologists say the territory has been inhabited since the Neolithic Age. Occupied by an ancient Georgian tribe of Moskhs from ancient times, the territory of Adjara was a province of Colchis from the 7th to 3rd centuries BC. Part of the area formed a county (saeristavo) within the Kingdom of Iberia in the late 4th century BC. Colonized by Greek merchants in the 5th and 4th century BC, the coastal Adjara later came under Roman rule. Bathus (Bathys) (the present day Batumi) and Apsaros (Apsaruntos) (modern Gonio) were the key cities and fortresses at that time. Archeological excavations have revealed ruins of a rich ancient town at Pichvnari near the present day town of Kobuleti. In the 2nd century AD, Bathus was an important military base for Roman legions. Apsaros was famous for its theatre. The early Christian era in Adjara was linked with names of Saint Andrew, Saint Simon the Canaanite and Matata. Saint Matthias is said to be buried in the Gonio fortress near Batumi. In the 2nd century AD, Adjara was incorporated in the kingdom of Lazica. The province's key fortress of Petra (Tsikhisdziri) served as a battlefield during the Lazic War between the Byzantines and Persians in 542‚Äì562. In the 9th century, the region was divided between two Georgian states, the Tao-Klarjeti and the Kingdom of Abkhazia. In the 11th century, Adjara became a part of the unified Georgian Kingdom and was governed by rulers of Samtskhe-Saatabago. The region was ravaged by Seljuks in the 11th century and by Mongols in the 13th century. After the disintegration of Georgian monarchy and subsequent internal wars, Adjara was passed from hands to hands until it became a part of the Principality of Guria in 1535. The Genoese established one of their Black Sea trading \\"factories\\" at the fortified town of Gonio at that time.  Adjara under Ottoman rule  An Ottoman military camp in Batum during the left In 1547, the Ottomans raided the province and captured Batumi. Liberated by Prince Rostom Gurieli of Guria in 1564, the region fell under the Turkish rule again in 1582. In 1609, Prince Mamia Gurieli temporarily relieved Batumi. However, Guria lost the province to the Ottomans in 1614. The area was divided into two sandjaks and submitted to the Pasha of Childir (Akhaltsikhe). Part of Adjarians fled to other Georgian regions. Those who remained were converted to Islam. The Ottomans had little direct control of Adjara and local Muslim Georgian nobility, such as the Khimshiashvili, ruled as semi-autonomous beys until the Ottoman government's centralizing reforms tanzimat eliminated them and brought the region more closely within the empire by 1850. There was opposition to the tanzimat efforts from both nobility, who resented the loss of their privileges, and peasantry, who opposed newly allocated taxes and conscription in the regular Ottoman army. In the 1840s, the Porte had to commit significant forces from the neighboring pashaliks to suppress a rebellion staged by Kor-Hussein Bey (Khimshiashvili). Three times did Kor-Hussein Bey rise in revolt, in 1840, 1844, and 1846; each time he was defeated and eventually sent as a prisoner to Constantinople. Among the rebels was Hasan Hasbi, sent, in 1845, by the Caucasian Imam Shamil in Adjara to recruit volunteers for his struggle against the Russian encroachment in Dagestan. After the suppression of the Adjarian uprising, he managed to escape. During the Crimean War of 1853-1856 and Russo- Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, thousands of Adjarians were recruited in the Ottoman army. During the war of 1877‚Äì1878, Batum was defended by a 25,000-strong Ottoman army under Dervish-Pasha as well as the Ottoman warships cruising off the Black Sea coastline. The Russians dispatched the Kobuleti Detachment of 12,000 troops commanded by Lt.-Gen. Oklobzhio, but he made little progress throughout the conflict. He was able to dislodge the Turks from the Mukha- Estate heights on April 14, 1877, and entrenched there until November 15. The only attempt to advance made by Oklobzhio was thwarted by the Ottomans at the clashes at Tsikhisdziri and the Sameba hills on June 11‚Äì12. In November, the fall of Kars and retreat of Dervish Pasha's troops to Batum combined with the advance of General Komarov's Ardahan Detachment to Batum enabled Oklobzhio to reclaim the positions, but the attack on Tsikhisdziri on January 18, 1878, was a failure. Then the ceasefire followed, ending the Russian operations against Batum.  Adjara under Russian rule  Adjarian peasants in the 1900s. The Ottomans ceded Adjara (called Adjaristan under Turkish rule) to the Russian Empire on March 3, 1878. Under the Russian oppression of Islam, thousands of Muslims fled the region in search of refuge in Turkey in an immigration process called Muhajiroba (see Muhajir (Caucasus)). Financed by the Ottomans, a terrorist organization known as The Avengers attempted to kill Russian officers and officials, along with Adjarians who collaborated with the imperial presence. Nevertheless, many Adjarians were loyal to Russia as they found the best opportunity to be reunited with other Georgians. The Berlin Congress of 1878 declared the regional capital of Batum a porto franco or free port. The city became an important seaport and industrial city towards the end of the 1880s. At the turn of the 20th century, Batumi was linked to the oil fields of Baku by one of the earliest pipelines (Baku-Batumi pipeline) and a railway, and it became one of the most important ports in the world. On June 22, 1892 the \\"Markus\\", a huge tanker ship departed Batumi for Bangkok, Thailand, becoming the first oil tanker to transit the Suez Canal. The region (called Batum Oblast under the Russian rule) witnessed numerous strikes and bloody crackdowns during the Russian Revolution of 1905-1907. During World War I, Adjarian muhajirs (emigrants to Turkey) formed a division within the Turkish army. Upon the evacuation of the Russian forces following the ceasefire of December 18, 1917, on 14 April 1918 the Ottoman 37th Caucasian Division entered Batum. In 1915, in the course of the ongoing war against Ottoman Empire, the Russian administration began a process of deportation of ‚Äúrefractory‚Äù Russian-subject Muslims from the Batumi region to interior Russian provinces, drawing protests from Georgian intellectuals. Soon thereafter, Georgian deputies in the Russian Duma declared that the Muslims being deported were not Turks but Adjarians, who were ‚ÄúGeorgian despite their Muslim religion, and therefore loyal Russians.‚Äù As a result of their protests, Grand Duke Georgi Mikhailovich presided over an investigation which ended its voluminous report with the conclusion that there Adjarians were not hostile to the Russian regime. It blamed Cossacks and Armenians for the allegations of Adjarian disloyalty and accused them of instigating violent confrontations with local Muslims. In the end, Grand Duke Nikolay Nikolaevich was persuaded to meet with Adjarian leaders, and he even awarded them for their loyalty. It was not until after the Russian Revolution of 1917, on January 26, 1918, that the investigation of alleged Adjarian treason was closed.Eric Lohr (2003), Nationalizing the Russian Empire: the Campaign against Enemy Aliens during World War I, pp. 151-2, 220-1. Harvard University Press, .  British Occupation  Memed Abashidze, leader of the Adjarian Mejlis On January 12, 1919 the British expeditionary forces landed at Batumi to replace the Turkish troops. The Council for Batum Region ‚Äî chaired by the Russian cadet P. Maslov ‚Äî was created to govern Adjara as a provisional authority from 21 December 1918 to 28 April 1919. The Committee of the Liberation of Muslim Georgia, led by Memed Abashidze and Haidar Abashidze, had repeatedly spoken of the establishment of autonomy on religious principles within the borders of Georgia. To work towards this, on September 13, 1919 a prototype parliament, the Mejlis, was convened in Batum. Though Abashidze's faction strongly advocated the union with Georgia, the drive towards autonomy was strong, even among the pro-Georgian Adjarians. Another, less numerous group known as Seday Mileth (in Turkish: \\"voice of people\\") propagated pro- and pan-Turkish ideas. On August 15, 1919, the withdrawal of British Troops began from the Caucasus. The divisional headquarters at Batum left for Constantinople, handing over to the military governor of Batum‚ÄîBr.-Gen. W. J. N. Cooke-Collis. On March 4, 1920, Cooke-Collis as appointed to command the Inter-Allied Force at Batum. This force was withdrawn from Batum by July 14, 1920.  Adjara in Democratic Republic of Georgia  The British administration ceded the region to Georgia on 20 July 1920. Bolsheviks and Russian agents organized a series of sabotages and terrorist acts. The administration of democratic Georgia accepted the idea of Adjara's autonomy, although it was only realized under Soviet rule. During the Soviet invasion of Georgia, Turkish forces occupied Batumi on March 11, 1921 and held the city until they were expelled by the Georgian troops under General Giorgi Mazniashvili on March 18, 1921. The Soviet rule in Batumi was declared the next day. Turkey recognized the region as a part of Georgian SSR by the Soviet-Turkish Treaty of Kars of 16 March 1921.  Adjara under Soviet rule  The Soviet government declared the Adjar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 16 July 1921. Turkey ceded the region to Bolsheviks on the condition that it would be granted autonomy, for the sake of the Muslims among Adjara's mixed population. It is thought also that Moscow wanted to avoid giving Georgia complete control of the important Black Sea port of Batumi and to bolster Communist leanings among the ethnic Georgian Muslims living in Turkey. Under Joseph Stalin, Islam, like Christianity, was repressed. In April 1929, the Muslim villagers of mountainous Adjara rose in arms against compulsory collectivization and religious persecution. The Soviet troops were invoked and the revolt was quickly put down. Thousands of Adjarians were deported from the republic.Peter Malcolm Holt, Ann K. S. Lambton, Bernard Lewis (1977), The Cambridge history of Islam, p. 639. Cambridge University Press,  Adjara under Aslan Abashidze  Aslan Abasidze ruled Adjara from 1991 until his overthrow in 2004. Flag of Adjara from 2000 to 2004. Following Georgia's first democratic parliamentary and presidential elections, President Zviad Gamsakhurdia appointed Aslan Abashidze as the head of the Adjara's Supreme Council on March 15, 1991 hoping that the latter would assist in canceling the autonomous status of the region. However, when Gamsakhurdia proposed to abolish Adjarian autonomy, Abashidze called Adjarians, especially the Muslims of the region, to rise in protest. Tensions with central Georgian authorities ensued. On 22 April 1991, pro-Abashidze protesters stormed administrative buildings in the central Batumi demanding the immediate resignation of several officials. The protests were effectively used by Abashidze to establish his own powerbase in the region. Gamsakhurdia facing serious internal problems already in Tbilisi preferred not to interfere in the Adjarian events. In turmoil, Nodar Imnadze, Abashidze's deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet and the highest placed supporter of Gamsakhurdia in Adjara, was killed in highly controversial circumstances. In Batumi's version, Imnadze was shot by guards while attempting to burst in Abashidze's office with a gun in his hands. The Tbilisi-controlled media simply printed unspecified obituaries. However, many claims have been made that Imnadze was killed by Abashidze himself during the argument at office. Under Abashidze's tight control of the autonomy, Adjara enjoyed relative political stability and economic prosperity during the Georgian Civil War. However, the majority of the Adjarians remained poor despite much foreign investment and numerous financial projects. On 24 October 1997, Adjara became a full member of the Assembly of European Regions (AER). The relations between the central and regional authorities were strained. Adjarian leadership often refused to pay taxes to the central budget. Abashidze took control over the customs, Batumi seaport and other strategic objects. He created his own semi-official armed units and had full control over the Batumi-based 25th Brigade of Georgia's Defense Ministry. The central government claimed Batumi-based Russian military unit was a powerbase for the Adjarian strongman and criticized Abashidze for his pro-Russian orientation. Georgia's ex-president Eduard Shevardnadze visited the region several times during his rule in 1992-2003 to attempt reconciliation with Abashidze. They reached a kind of compromise in which Adjara obtained larger autonomous status, Abashidze agreed not to run for the presidency of Georgia, and Shevardnadze allowed Abashidze to maintain power in Adjara. The latter's party, the Union of Democratic Revival of Georgia, cooperated with Shevardnadze's ruling Union of Citizens of Georgia party in the 1995 parliamentary elections, but broke with Shevardnadze after the elections. Abashidze's Revival Party had thirty members in the Georgian parliament, and was seen as a moderate opposition to the central government in Tbilisi. After the rigged elections of 2003 and the ensuing \\"Rose Revolution\\" in Georgia, Abashidze described the November 2003 ouster of Shevardnadze as \\"a violent coup d'√©tat\\".  Adjara crisis  The Choloki bridge destroyed by Abashidze's forces in May 2004. On November 23, 2003, immediately after Shevardnadze's fall, Aslan Abashidze declared a state of emergency in the region. Nevertheless, Adjara took part in the Georgian presidential elections of January 4, 2004, won by Mikheil Saakashvili. Saakashvili ordered the Adjarian leader to comply with the Georgian constitution and start disarming. In May 2004, Abashidze claimed that Georgian forces were preparing to invade. His forces blew up bridges connecting the region with the rest of Georgia. The state of emergency was followed by the dispersal of local oppositional demonstrations as of May 4. This proved a catalyst for even larger demonstrations later on the same day. Tens of thousands from all Adjara headed for Batumi to demand Abashidze's resignation. On May 6, Abashidze's position became untenable when local protesters took control over the central Batumi and Georgian Special Forces entered the region and started to disarm pro- Abashidze groups. After overnight talks with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Igor Ivanov, Mr. Abashidze resigned and departed the country for Moscow.  Post-Abashidze era  Flag of Adjara (adopted in 2004) Batumi in 2012 On May 7, 2004 direct presidential rule was imposed in Adjara and 20-member Interim Council was set up to run the Autonomous Republic before the fresh local elections could be held in the region. Levan Varshalomidze was appointed as the Chairman of the Interim Council. Regional parliamentary elections were held on June 20. Victorious Adjara, party backed by President Saakashvili won 28 seats out of 30 in the local legislative body. The 2 other seats were occupied by Saakashvili's former allies, the Republican Party. There were allegations of vote-rigging from the Republicans, after they won less than 15 per cent of the vote. On July 20, Adjarian Supreme Council approved Levan Varshalomidze as the Chairman of the Autonomous Republic's Government. The regional policy of central and local governments focuses on attracting foreign investments in the region. A largescale campaign of privatization has been launched for this purpose. Russian military presence was another challenge in the region. Russia promised to withdraw its base at the 1999 Istanbul OSCE summit, and the protracted process of the ensuing negotiations remained a source of great tension with Georgia until the base was finally withdrawn by 2008.

Career Burrows was born in Exeter, Devon. In the early 1960s, he was a member of The Kestrels, a vocal harmony group which also included the future songwriting team Roger Greenaway and Roger Cook. Subsequently he joined The Ivy League, and was still with them when they metamorphosed into The Flower Pot Men. The Flower Pot Men had only one hit, \\"Let's Go to San Francisco\\", which reached #4 on the UK Singles Chart in the autumn of 1967. Two founding members of Deep Purple, Jon Lord and Nick Simper, were also part of this early band. Later, Burrows sang the lead vocals on several other one-hit wonder songs under different group names, Edison Lighthouse's \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\" (February 1970); White Plains' \\"My Baby Loves Lovin'\\" (March 1970); The Pipkins' novelty song \\"Gimme Dat Ding\\" (April 1970); and The First Class' \\"Beach Baby\\" (July 1974). He also sang lead vocals on The Brotherhood of Man's \\"United We Stand\\", which reached #10 on the UK charts and also reached #13 in the U.S. A published interview with Burrows claims that he became the first (and still the only) recording artist to appear on BBC Television's Top of the Pops fronting three different group acts appearing almost sequentially in a single broadcast show: Edison Lighthouse (the #1 British-charted hit that week), White Plains, and Brotherhood of Man. However records show that this did not happen. He did, however, have two of his bands on the same Top of the Pops four times between 29 January and 26 February 1970. Appearing alongside Edison Lighthouse on the shows were Brotherhood of Man (29-01-70 and 19-02-70) and White Plains (12-02-70 and 26-02-70). The appearances on 29 January, 5 February and 26 February 1970 are all still in existence. Although he hit the Top 40 as the lead singer of five different groups, he only managed to have one chart single as a solo artist in the U.S. In 1970, he hit the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Melanie Makes Me Smile\\", which peaked at #87. As well as fronting various hit-making acts, Burrows has also contributed vocals as a session singer to many other hits, claiming to have sung on 100 Top 20 hits in the 1970s. He has also recorded as a session harmony singer with Elton John, Cliff Richard, and James Last. In 2011, Burrows was awarded with BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of his contribution to music.

The Austrian Imperial army, joined by the Venetian Army, jointly commanded by Archduke Albrecht of Habsburg, defeated the Italian army, led by Alfonso Ferrero la Marmora and Enrico Cialdini. Background In June 1866, the German Kingdom of Prussia declared war on the Austrian Empire. The recently formed Kingdom of Italy decided to seize the opportunity and allied with Prussia with the intention of annexing Venetia and thus uniting the Italian Peninsula. The Italians rapidly built up a military force that was twice the size of their Austrian counterparts defending Venetia. Order of Battle Austrian South Army (Field Marshal Archduke Albrecht) *V Corps (General Gabriel Freiherr von Rodich) ::Moering, Piret Brigades *VII Corps (General Joseph Freiherr von Maroicic) ::Scudier, T√∂ply, Welsersheimb Brigades *IX Corps (General Ernst Ritter von Hartung) ::B√∂ck, Kirchsberg, Weckbecker Brigades *Reserve Division (General Friedrich Rupprecht) ::Two weak brigades *Cavalry Division (General Ludwig Freiherr von Pulz) Italian Mincio Army (General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora) *I Corps (General Giovanni Durando) ::1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th Divisions *III Corps (General Enrico Morozzo Della Rocca) ::7th, 8th, 9th and 16th Divisions, plus an unattached Cavalry DivisionThe II Corps, with its 6th, 10th and 19th Divisions, did not engage in the battle. Wavro pp. 96-116 Battle In the fourth week of May, the Italians divided their forces into two armies: the 11 division strong Army of the Mincio led by General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora and accompanied by King Vittorio Emanuele II, and the 5 division strong Army of the Po, led by Enrico Cialdini. The Austrians, using the advantage of interior lines and the protection given by the Quadrilateral forts, concentrated against the Army of the Mincio and left a covering force against the Army of the Po. The King's force was to move into the Trentino region, while La Marmora's crossed the Mincio River and invaded Venetia. Meanwhile, the Austrian soldiers under Archduke Albrecht of Habsburg marched west from Verona to the north of the Italians, in an attempt to move behind the Italians so as to cut them off from the rear, and thus, slaughter them. At the start of the 24 June 1866, La Marmora changed the direction of his front, toward the same heights the Austrians were trying to use as a launching point for their attack. Instead of an enveloping battle, the two forces collided head on, with both headquarters trying to discover what happened in the heights near Villafranca.Wawro, pp. 100-103. On the Austrian left, the Austrian cavalry attacked the Italian I Corps without orders at 7 AM. Although the attack was ineffectual and only crippled the Austrian cavalry, it created a panic in the Italian rear and immobilized three Italian divisions, who for the rest of the battle only took a defensive posture.Wawro, pp. 104-107. During the morning isolated fights broke out in Oliosi, San Rocco, Custoza and San Giorgio between Rodic‚Äôs V Corps and Durando‚Äôs I Corps. After fierce fighting the division of Cerale was thrown out of Oliosi, broke, and fled to the Mincio. Sirtori‚Äôs division was blocked from Monte Vento by Rodic‚Äôs other troops and by 8:00am, he was thrown back by fierce bayonet attacks. By 8:30am however, gaps were opening in the Austrian line. Brignone‚Äôs division had taken Belvedere Hill near Custoza after fighting with Hartung‚Äôs IX Corps.Wawro, pp. 107-109. By 9:00am, Hartung started launching attacks up Monte Croce, trying to dislodge Brignone, but by 10:00am the Austrians seemed spent. The Italians however neglected reinforcing Brignone. The King‚Äôs younger son Amadeo led a counterattack, which failed, with the prince being severely wounded, and Brignone was ultimately forced to leave the position.Wawro, pp. 109-111. Prince Amadeo wounded at Custoza (1870) by Giovanni Fattori La Marmora then ordered the divisions of Cugia and Govone up the heights to relieve Brignone. This forced the Austrian brigades of B√∂ck and Scudier out of Custoza. Scudier then retired from the field, opening another gap in the Austrian line. On the Italian left Sirtori had managed to stabilize his front after Cerale‚Äôs flight. At this point in the battle, both sides were thinking they were facing a lost battle.Wawro, pp. 111-112. By 1:00pm La Marmora, deciding the battle was lost and wanting to secure his bridgeheads, ordered a retreat. Unbeknownst to La Marmora, Govone‚Äôs division had beaten back the VII Corps and captured Belvedere Hill. By 2 PM Rodic launched an attack on Monte Vento and Santa Lucia. When Sirtori‚Äôs division gave way, a hole appeared in the Italian line, which the Austrians exploited. Govone, who thought he had finally broken through the Austrian line, suddenly found himself isolated near Custoza, with Rodic on one flank and an Austrian brigade making for the bridge at Monzambano. At this point, he was attacked in his other flank by Maroicic, who without orders had committed the two Austrian reserve brigades to the fight. At the same time Hartung‚Äôs Corps was ordered to restart the fight. They drove off the division of Cugia, capturing six guns and many prisoners on the top of Monte Torre, which they had earlier failed to capture. After a bombardment by 40 Austrian guns, at 5:00pm the Italians were driven out of Custoza by Maroicic.Wawro, pp. 114-116. Aftermath The Austrians were victorious, both strategically and tactically. The Italians were driven back across the Mincio out of Veneto. It was, however, not a decisive defeat. To inflict a decisive defeat on the Italians, Albrecht's forces needed to drive southwest to seize the bridges across the Mincio (which the Italians had neglected to fortify). Such a pursuit would have trapped the disbanded remnants of the two Italian corps on the east bank of the river and enabled Albrecht to invade the Kingdom of Italy itself. Instead, Albrecht did not order a pursuit because he thought the Austrians were too exhausted and the Austrian cavalry had been mauled by frivolous attacks in the morning. He thus squandered the possibility of destroying the demoralized Army of the Mincio. On the 26 June 1866, Albrecht shifted his headquarters back to Verona, because he was concerned about a possible French reply to an Austrian invasion of Lombardy. He should not have been: even the Emperor advised Albrecht to ignore all political considerations.Wawro, pp. 116-120. After their loss at K√∂niggr√§tz (3 July), the Austrians were forced to transfer one corps from South Army to Austria to cover Vienna, weakening their forces in Veneto. The Italians, however, resumed their offensive only in mid-July. Cialdini crossed the Po and occupied Rovigo (11 July), Padua (12 July), Treviso (14 July), San Don√† di Piave (18 July), Valdobbiadene and Oderzo (20 July), Vicenza (21 July) and finally Udine, in Friuli (22 July). In the meantime Garibaldi's volunteers had pushed forward from Brescia towards Trento (see Invasion of Trentino) fighting victoriously at the battle of Bezzecca of the 21 July. Despite the victory at Custoza and a naval defeat of the Italians at Lissa, due to K√∂niggr√§tz the Austrians were forced to surrender to the Prussians and were forced to cede Veneto. Scenes from the Italian side of this battle were recreated for the 1954 Luchino Visconti film Senso.

It lies on the west bank of the Dee near its confluence with the Tarff Water. Tongland Power station History The factory where 'Galloway' cars were made Tongland Abbey, a medieval Premonstratensian monastic community, existed here during the Middle Ages. The remains of Tongland Abbey are now within the churchyard just south of the main road. Tongland Church built in 1813, is now disused and in a state of ruin, although the graveyard is still in use. The Dee is crossed shortly downriver by Tongland Bridge, a stone arch bridge constructed in 1806 by civil engineer Thomas Telford. Telford was assisted in the Works by resident civil engineer, A Blane. There is also an earlier bridge dating to 1761 which is approximately to the north-east. Since the 1930s, Tongland has been the site of a hydro- electric power station, part of the Galloway Hydro Electric Scheme. The station used to be open to visitors during the summer months, since 2007 this has no longer been the case. Slightly earlier, between 1921 and 1922 'Galloway' cars were made in Tongland in a First World War factory staffed mainly by female apprentice engineers. The Galloway Engineering Company factory was originally completed in 1917 and was powered by its own hydro- electric scheme on the Dee. Since 2004, there have been several construction projects, with the site of a former garage now home to three new houses. There are also several more houses being constructed. In 2006, street lights were installed along the A711 which passes through the village. Notable people *Joe Dobson, co-founder of Interflora was born in Tongland in 1875.

He was described as bold and outspoken.  Biography  Angermannus was born around 1540 in the province of √Öngermanland, Sweden, whence his name is derived. In 1576 he was appointed school principal at a school in Stockholm. But because of his criticism towards the liturgy of King John III of Sweden, John tried to get him to move somewhere else. After turning down the offer of becoming professor at Uppsala University, Angermannus was forced to become vicar in the remote city √ñregrund. Still polemizing, the king then moved him again to an even remoter area, to Saltvik on the island √Öland. This did not silence him. In his preachings he spoke sharply against papism and liturgy until eventually John sent some men to arrest him and he was taken to the prison in √Öbo, Finland. With some help he managed to escape, and got on a boat back to Stockholm to the king's brother Duke Charles with whom he thought himself secure. But he was nonetheless prosecuted in Stockholm. With help from Duke Charles, he in 1582 escaped on a boat to Charles sister Elisabeth in Mecklenburg, Germany, to avoid the trial. In Germany he lived for eleven years. He visited the universities of Wittenberg, Leipzig and Frankfurt. All the time he spoke heavily against liturgy and papism and Duke Charles was supporting him from Sweden as much as he could. In Germany he had published books such as Proposition about our Swedish Church Doctrines and Rites in Swedish 1587 and Historia Liturgica in 1588. It led to him being considered a martyr and a strongman for the true Lutheran faith. For these reasons the chapter of Uppsala elected him archbishop in 1593, although neither the Duke Charles nor the present king Sigismund were in favor of it. He was the person in charge of the Uppsala Synod in 1593, where the main doctrines of the Swedish Lutheran Church and the privileges for the Uppsala University were decided. In 1596 he undertook an inspection through his diocese. During the travel he was so harshly changing the remainders of the Catholic Church rituals he did not approve of that he was almost attacked by the peasants. His intent was to purge the country from everything which did not answer to the Lutheran doctrine, including everything from old Catholic and Pagan customs to sex outside of marriage; it also caused the first wave of witch trials in Sweden, though they did not lead to any death sentences. The Duke Charles, who had by now been crowned as Charles IX, got upset by the agitations from the archbishop. After the archbishop had undertaken some other actions that the king did not approve of, the king put him on trial for not doing his duty in 1599. In spite of the bishops' refusal to admit him guilty, the king decided that he was indeed so, and had him imprisoned. Eventually he was transferred to Gripsholm prison where he remained until his death in October 1607.

The crisis threatened to develop into military confrontation as both sides mobilized their forces at the internal border. However, Georgia's post-revolutionary government of President Mikheil Saakashvili managed to avoid bloodshed and with the help of Adjaran opposition reasserted its supremacy. Abashidze left the region in exile in May 2004 and was succeeded by Levan Varshalomidze.  Tensions  Georgians celebrate the Rose Revolution in Tbilisi (November 2003) Adjaran leader Aslan Abashidze, being in strong opposition to the Rose Revolution, declared a state of emergency immediately after Eduard Shevardnadze's ousting on November 23, 2003. Following negotiations with central authorities, the state of emergency was temporarily canceled on January 3, 2004, just one day before the presidential election. The state of emergency was renewed on January 7 and was followed by the crackdown of an oppositional demonstration. On January 19, dozens were injured as a result of clashes between protesters and police in the southern Adjaran village of Gonio. The protesters demanded the resignation of Aslan Abashidze. In the wake of Abashidze's visit to Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on January 20 backing Abashidze's policy and condemning his opposition as \\"extremist forces.\\" In late January, Georgian officials, including Acting President Nino Burjanadze and President-elect Mikheil Saakashvili, met with Abashidze in Batumi. On February 20, the opposition movement's offices were again raided after the opposition had staged a protest rally in Batumi. Clashes between supporters of and opposition to Abashidze also took place in Kobuleti. Disorders coincided with the visit of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe (CoE) Walter Schwimmer in Batumi, who held talks with Aslan Abashidze. President Saakashvili demanded from Adjaran leadership to abolish the Autonomous Republic's Security Ministry, which was Abashidze's main weapon of repression.  At the Choloki Bridge  Aslan Abashidze, the leader of Adjara (1991-2004) The situation escalated on March 14, when the central Georgian officials took advantage of Abashidze's being in Moscow and headed to Adjara to hold campaign for parliamentary elections scheduled on March 28. However, pro-Abashidze armed groups blocked the administrative border of Adjara at the Choloki River and prevented President Mikheil Saakashvili and other members of the government to travel to the Autonomous Republic. The Adjaran authorities claimed Saakashvili was going to take control over the region by force. In retaliation, Georgia's central authorities imposed partial economic sanctions against its defiant region in a bid \\"to exhaust Adjaran regime's resources\\". Tensions defused between Tbilisi and Batumi on March 16 after President Saakashvili and Aslan Abashidze met and struck a deal that allowed for economic sanctions on Adjara to be lifted. An agreement has been reached over disarmament of paramilitary forces in Adjara, release of political prisoners, joint control of the customs and port of Batumi, and providing conditions for free election campaigning in Adjara. However, Abashidze refused to disarm his paramilitary forces in April. On April 19-April 21, Batumi-based military commanders Major General Roman Dumbadze and Murad Tsintsadze officially announced their insubordination to central authorities' orders. On April 24, Adjaran Senate approved Aslan Abashidze's proposal to impose a curfew in the region. However, dozens of soldiers of Adjaran leader Aslan Abashidze's elite special purpose unit began to leave the region and pledged loyalty to the country's central authorities. Several Adjaran officials also did so. Local opposition resumed series of protests in Batumi, being broken up severely on April 30. At the end of April, Georgia launched its largest ever military exercises at the Kulevi training ground, near the Black Sea town of Poti. The Large-scale war games, some 30 km away from Adjara's administrative border, was a show of strength, amid confrontation between central authorities and the self-minded Adjaran leader. In retaliation, the two key bridges connecting Adjara with the rest of Georgia over the Choloki River were blown up by Abashidze's forces to prevent incursion in Adjara allegedly planned by the country's central authorities. On May 3, the U.S. Department of State condemned Abashidze's activities and accused him of \\"trying to provoke military crisis\\".  Adjara's Revolution  Bridge over the Choloki destroyed by Abashidze's loyalists in April 2004 On May 4, a large opposition protest rally was attacked by the local security forces in Batumi. Dozens of protesters were reportedly injured. However, the violent break up of peaceful demonstration proved a catalyst for even larger protests later on the same day. Tens of thousands from all Adjara headed to Batumi demanding Abashidze's resignation. Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania and Interior Minister Giorgi Baramidze crossed the Choloki River on May 5 and held talks with Adjaran Interior Minister Jemal Gogitidze. The latter agreed to withdraw his forces and paramilitary groups from the administrative border provided he would be guaranteed with security. Abashidze's position became untenable when local protesters took control of the central part of the city of Batumi and Georgian special forces entered the region and started to disarm pro-Abashizde militants. Later on the same day, Secretary of the Russian Security Council Igor Ivanov arrived in Batumi. Abashidze stepped down after overnight talks with Ivanov and left for Moscow. \\"Aslan has fled, Adjara is free,\\" President Saakashvili announced at the dawn of St George's Day on May 6 and congratulated Georgians with what he described as \\"a second bloodless revolution\\" in Georgia. President Saakashvili also said that Abashidze's resignation \\"will pave the way for Georgia's prosperity.\\" \\"It will be the beginning of Georgia's territorial integrity,\\" he added. Saakashvili left for Adjara shortly after Aslan Abashidze's departure and met celebrating Adjarans in Batumi. On May 7, direct presidential rule was imposed in Adjara and a 20-member Interim Council was set up to run the Autonomous Republic before fresh local elections could be held in the region. Levan Varshalomidze was appointed as the Chairman of the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara. Regional parliamentary elections were held on June 20. Victorious Adjara, a party backed by President Saakashvili won 28 seats out of 30 in the local legislative body. The remaining two seats were occupied by Saakashvili's former allies, members of the Republican Party. There were allegations of vote-rigging from the Republicans, after they won less than 15 percent of the vote. On July 20, the Adjaran Supreme Council approved Levan Varshalomidze as the Chairman of the Autonomous Republic's Government.

The city of Brno had the right to brew beer from the 12th century while Plze≈à and ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice (Pilsen and Budweis in German), had breweries in the 13th century. The most common Czech beers are pale lagers of pilsner type, with characteristic transparent golden colour, high foaminess and lighter flavour. The Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world. The largest Czech beer breweries are Pilsner Urquell (Plze≈àsk√Ω prazdroj, the world's first pilsner, Gambrinus, Velkopopovick√Ω Kozel, Radegast and Master brands), Staropramen (Staropramen, Ostravar, Bran√≠k and Velvet) and Budweiser Budvar. Other top selling brands include Kru≈°ovice, Starobrno, B≈ôez≈à√°k, Zlatopramen, Lobkowicz, Bernard and Svijany. History A glass of unfiltered dark beer from U Flek≈Ø brewery Map of Czech Republic made up of beer caps. The history of beer in the modern Czech Republic, historically Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, goes back even before the Slavic migration in the 6th century, although the ingredients differed from those used today. Hops have been grown, used in beer making and exported from here since the twelfth century. Most towns had at least one brewery, the most famous brewing cities in Bohemia being Budweis, Plze≈à, and Prague. Other towns with breweries are Rakovn√≠k, ≈Ωatec, and T≈ôebo≈à. =Beer in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice= South Bohemian Budweiser Budvar Today the city has two main breweries: Budƒõjovick√Ω mƒõ≈°≈•ansk√Ω pivovar a.s. (Samson Budweiser Bier) and Budƒõjovick√Ω Budvar n.p. (Budweiser Budvar). The city of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice was for centuries also known by its German name, Budweis. Brewing is recorded in the city since the 13th century. The modern Budƒõjovick√Ω mƒõ≈°≈•ansk√Ω pivovar was founded in 1795 as the B√ºrgerliches Brauhaus Budweis, and is the oldest brewery in the world to use the term \\"budweiser\\" when referring to its beer. In 1895, the Budƒõjovick√Ω Budvar brewery opened as an ethnically Czech alternative to the German dominated Budƒõjovick√Ω mƒõ≈°≈•ansk√Ω pivovar. In 1876, the US brewer Anheuser-Busch began making a beer which it also called \\"Budweiser\\". This led to the \\"Budweiser trademark dispute\\" between beer companies claiming trademarks rights to the name. In the European Union, Budƒõjovick√Ω Budvar is recognized as a product with Protected Geographical Indication. Because of such disputes, Budvar is sold in the United States and Canada under the label Czechvar and Anheuser-Busch sells its beer as Bud in the most of the European Union. =Beer in Pilsen= Main gate at Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj, home of Pilsner Urquell Pilsner Urquell was the first \\"pilsner\\" type beer in the world. In 1842, a brewery in Plze≈à employed Josef Groll, a German brewer who was experienced in the Bavarian lager method of making beer. Beer in Pilsen at the time was not of very good quality and they needed to compete. Groll developed a golden Pilsner beer, the first light coloured lager beer ever brewed. It became an immediate success, and was exported all over the Austrian Empire. A special train of beer travelled from Plze≈à to Vienna every morning. Exports of Czech beer reached Paris and the United States by 1874. Today, beers made at Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj are Pilsner Urquell, Gambrinus and Primus. =Beer in Prague= Much of the brewing history of the Czech capital is connected to the various monasteries in the city, with brewing first recorded at the Benedictine B≈ôevnov Monastery in 993 AD. It is also recorded that in 1088 AD, King Vratislav II granted a tithe of hops to the Canons of Vy≈°ehrad Cathedral in order to brew beer. Today the Prague brewing scene is quite diverse, with Staropramen being the only industrial brewery. There is a total of 40 breweries and brewpubs, the oldest among them being U Flek≈Ø, which was founded in 1499 and has been brewing beer ever since. Most of the other breweries and brewpubs have been established in the city post-1989 and especially, post-2000. =Beer in Brno and South Moravia= South Moravia is known for winemaking and there are only few large breweries, namely Starobrno in Brno and ƒåern√° hora, although since the 2000s Akciov√Ω Pivovar Dale≈°ice, Pegas and Richard have been gaining country wide popularity, despite smaller production.Guide to beer, pubs and alehouses in Brno  Categories of beer  A glass of Czech lager Most beer brewed in the Czech Republic is lager. Czech beers vary in colour from pale (Svƒõtl√©), through amber (Polotmav√©) and dark (Tmav√©) to black (ƒåern√©) and in strength from 3‚Äì9% ABV. Top fermented wheat beer (P≈°eniƒçn√© pivo) is also available. In the Czech Republic, it is still customary to label the strength of beer by the so-called degree scale (in Czech: Stup≈àovitost). It is expressed as a weight percentage of sucrose and is used to indicate the percentage by weight of extract (sucrose) in a solution. So, the 12¬∞ beer has 12% of these substances dissolved in water. A 10 degree beer is about 4% alcohol by volume, a 12 degree is about 5% and 16 degree is about 6.5%. According to Czech law, categories of beer, regardless of colour or style, are: * lehk√© ‚Äì a \\"light\\" beer brewed below 8¬∞ Balling and with less than 130kJ per 100ml * v√Ωƒçepn√≠ ‚Äì a \\"draught\\" beer, though it can be bottled, brewed between 8¬∞ and 10¬∞ * le≈æ√°k ‚Äì a \\"lager\\" beer, brewed between 11¬∞ and 12.99¬∞ * speci√°l ‚Äì a \\"special\\" beer, brewed above 13¬∞Evan Rail, 2007. Good Beer Guide Prague and the Czech Republic: CAMRA Books Originally, Pilsner was a specific term for beers brewed in Plze≈à (with Pilsner Urquell being registered as a trademark by the first brewery). The term has come to mean any pale, hoppy lager as a result of imitations of the original beer, especially in Germany where the style is common. Festivals The Czech Beer Festival in Prague There are a lot of beer festivals in the Czech Republic. One of them is Pilsner Fest, a two-day beer festival held each year by the Pilsner Urquell Brewery in Pilsen with music by local bands on four stages in the town or festival Slavnosti piva v ƒåesk√Ωch Budƒõjovic√≠ch (in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice). The Czech Beer Festival (ƒåesk√Ω pivn√≠ festival) in Prague is the biggest beer festival in Czech Republic held for 17 days every year in May. Festival visitors can taste more than 70 brands of Czech beer. Research institutions * Malting Institute in Brno * Research Institute of Brewing and Malting * Hop Research Institute  Exports  = Overview = With over forty industrial breweries and seventy small and medium-sized family breweries in the Czech Republic, beer is one of the most important and well known exports in the Czech Republic. In 2016, approximately 3.68 million hectoliters of beer was exported within the European Union. As of 2017, the Czech Republic was number ten in the world's top beer exports, with an export amount of 273.9 million dollars in exports and 1.9 percent of the world's total beer exports. Within the European Union, the Czech Republic was ranked as the seventh largest producer. Forty percent of beer in the Czech Republic is exported to Germany, Slovakia, Sweden, England, and Russia. Additionally, Czech exports to China doubled from 2014 to 2015, and 0.65 of 3.65 million hectoliters of beer was exported to China. In 2015, Slovakia imported 1,108 thousand hectoliters of beer and Germany imported 900 thousand hectoliters. There has been a steady decrease in beer consumption within the Czech Republic, but breweries have noted an increase in their production due to rising international interest in Czech beer. Exports are especially important for Czech breweries, as consumption in the Czech Republic has decreased by about five liters per person. CEO of Staropramen, Petr Kova≈ô√≠k, speculates this is due to a smoking ban in the Czech Republic. = Economic Impacts of Beer = The total employment generated by the beer sector in the Czech Republic provided about 76,000 jobs in 2014. This number actually declined by 4.6 percent from 2013, and this shift may be explained by the increasing number of microbreweries and specialty beers, or more beer mixes and ciders being consumed. In 2013 and 2014, the total consumer spending on beer within the Czech Republic, in euros, was at 2,563,000 million euros and 2,431,000 euros respectively. Additionally, the total brewing production increased in 2013 to 2014 from 18.7 billion euros to 19.1 billion euros. This production included all brewing companies, breweries, and microbreweries. In total, in 2016 the Czech breweries produced a record amount of beer, at 20.48 million hectoliters. This was an increase from 2015 of 1.5 percent. Tourists consumed 750,000 hectoliters of beer in 2016, and this was an increase from 2015 of nineteen percent. In 2012, beer production accounted for 0.8 percent of nominal Gross Domestic Product, and the Czech government benefits from taxes paid on beer. Revenue from excise duties, VAT tax, and income tax in 2012 was about 28,506 million Czech korunas. = Brewing Companies =  Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj Group  For more general information on Pilsner beer, see the article: Pilsner Urquell Brewery. Founded in 1842, the most popular brewing company in the Czech Republic has grown significantly since its creation. In present day, the Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj group of breweries brews the following beers: Pilsner Urquell, Gambrinus, Velkopopovick√Ω Kozel, and Radegast. This group has three separate breweries, each of which produce their own specific beer. As the most popular brewing group in the Czech Republic, their exports of beer continue to grow annually and their popularity continues to spread across the world. Not only is the beer popular internationally, but in the Czech Republic, on average forty percent of the beers served in the Czech Republic are brewed from Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj. In 2010, the Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj group saw an increase in exports by five percent, especially in the German market, with 240,000 hectoliters, the Slovak market, with 114,500 hectolitres, and the British market, with 24,000 hectolitres. Additionally, in 2010 they began to sell their beers to the United Arab Emirates, Syria, South Korea, Vietnam, and Argentina. In 2012, the Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj group announced they had the largest beer exports yet, with a record of 685 thousand hectoliters. There continued to be an increase in sales in Slovakia, with additional export sales to Canada and Hungary. The group estimated an increase in exports to Australia by forty percent. The company credits their growing sales to Asian countries like Vietnam and Taiwan to the number of international visitors to their country; Taiwan is the third largest nationality that visits the brewery every year, after Czechs and Germans. In an effort to boost their popularity and continue to grow their worldwide reputation, in 2018 the Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj group invested over 280 million Czech koruna into expanding production facilities. The goal of the expansion project is to keep up with increasing their export demands. Currently, the brewery produces 62,800 hectoliters of beer a week, but the goal is to increase production to 88,300 hectolitres a week. After the expansion, 3.5 million hectolitres of Pilsner Urquell will be produced annually. Sales in South Korea increased forty percent in 2017 from the previous year, with half the sales being Velkopopovick√Ω Kozel. A half-liter can of Pilsner Urquell sells for 500 Czech Koruna, which is ten times the price it is sold for in the Czech Republic. In 2016, Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj sold 11 million hectolitres of beer, with an increase in 1 million hectoliters, and exports grew by ten percent. Additionally, it is speculated that the increase in beer exports and consumption is contributed to the fact that the brewing company's parent company, SABMiller, was sold to the Japanese company Asahi Breweries. The company sought out to acquire more brewing companies, as beer consumption has been declining in Japan. In present day, in 2017, over one third of Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj's sales were from exports, which is an increase of eight percent from the previous year. Exports increased by 1.5 million hectoliters. In April, right after Ashai Breweries purchased Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj, the company began exporting to China and the beer is now available in large cities in China. Karel Kraus, the manager of the Pilsner Urquell brand, credits the success of the brewing company to their increase in beer on tap, which is exported to more than thirty countries and represents twenty percent of the Pilsner Urquell beer industry.  Staropramen Brewery  For more general information on Staropramen Brewery, see Staropramen Brewery. Available in more than thirty five countries worldwide, Pivovary Staropramen is the second largest beer producer in the Czech Republic. The beers brewed by this company are: Staropramen, Bran√≠k, and Velvet. Currently, the company operates two breweries: Staropramen and Ostravar. It has been in business since 1998 and it holds 15.6 percent of the domestic market. Staropramen is owned by Molson Coors, and one of the primary goals of the parent company is to strengthen its sales in the United Kingdom. In 2008, Staropramen exported 687,000 hectoliters of beer. This can be compared to present day, where in 2017, Staropramen sold 3.1 million hectoliters of beer. This was an increase of six thousand hectoliters from the previous year. According to the CEO of Staropramen, Petr Kova≈ô√≠k, the goal of the company is: ‚Äú...not to be in as many countries as possible, but we only choose the strategic markets. Where we enter, we try to do a good job.‚Äù The largest export country for Staropramen is Slovakia, and then Sweden, Germany and Great Britain. Additionally, sales in Poland have grown by ten percent in the last two years. Sales in central and southeast Europe have grown by thirty percent in the last year. In 2016, Staropramen has launched its lighter beer Pravha in the UK, which is now brewed in Burton upon Trent. This has become quite controversial with many consumers. Although brewed to the Czech recipe, the taste has been compromised.  Heineken Ceska Republika Group  Heineken is the third largest beer producer in the world, and the Heineken Ceska Republika Group owns three breweries in the Czech Republic. The company produces and exports Starobrno, Kru≈°ovice, Zlatopramen, and B≈ôez≈à√°k.  Budejovicky Budvar  Budejovicky Budvar, not to be confused with the American company Budweiser, is the one of the largest brewing companies in the Czech Republic and produces Budweiser, Budvar, Budweiser Budvar. In 2014, the company exported a record number of beers, at 813,000 hectoliters. Between 2010 and 2014, the company increase the volume of exports by thirty four percent. The main sales are to Germany and Slovakia, where sales rose from 2013 to 2014 by ten percent and eight percent, respectively. Russia used to be a large importer of Budejovicky Budvar beer, but after the devaluation of the rouble in 2010. In 2017, Budejovicky Budvar continued to increase its exports and they exported a record volume of beer at 990,508 hectoliters of beer to 76 countries. Additionally, the amount of beer exported increased in 56 countries, with the largest amount being exported to Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Canada, Germany, Austria, and Russia. This year, Budejovicky Budvar was able to begin exporting to Africa, South America, and Asia. After 2017, Budejovicky Budvar exported 21.5 percent of Czech beer exports. As a result of the increase in exports, the brewery is beginning construction to expand its brewery and meet the export demand for its customers. Due to this record breaking year, Budejovicky Budvar is the second largest beer exporter in the Czech Republic. However, the company was unable to meet all orders due to their limited production capacities.

Location The Magpie River is long. It rises near the border between Quebec and Labrador, flows south, and enters Magpie Bay on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence west of Havre-Saint-Pierre. Two of its tributaries are named Magpie West and Magpie East. The central section contains the long Lake Magpie The river is not wide, but fast and turbulent. It cannot be navigated even by light boats. Its estuary is wide and forms a harbour for fishing boats. The village of Magpie is on the hillside around another small harbor on Magpie Bay west of the river mouth, and is one of the oldest towns on the C√¥te-Nord. The site was visited from 1849 by Gaspesians from Chaleur Bay who came to fish for cod and Atlantic salmon. The village boomed after the fishing companies Robin & Colas and Le Bouthillier establish facilities there around 1870. Name The river is named for the Canada jay (Perisoreus canadensis), which the English called \\"magpie\\". In the 19th century the local people pronounced in Magpointe. In 1870 Eug√®ne-√âtienne Tach√©'s map showed the river as \\"R. Magpie or La Pie\\". In 1886 the surveyor Saint-Cyr called it Rivi√®re √† la Pie. It is nicknamed La Pie. According to the Abb√© Victor-Alphonse Huard, it was also called Girard River after the three Girard brothers who settled in the area around 1849. The Innu have called it by various names, including Moteskikan Hipu, meaning \\"abrupt\\", \\"rocky\\" or \\"difficult\\" river, Mutehekau Hipu which translates as \\"river where the water passes between the square rocky cliffs\\" and Pmotewsekaw Sipo which means \\"river along which one walks among the shrubs\\".

It lies between the basins of the Jupitagon River to the west and the Saint-Jean River to the east. It is partly in the unorganized territories of Lac-J√©r√¥me and Rivi√®re-Nipissis, partly in the municipality of Rivi√®re-Saint-Jean. According to the Dictionnaire des rivi√®res et lacs de la province de Qu√©bec (1914), Lake Magpie is from the mouth of the Magpie River. It is about long and very deep. It is bordered on each side by capes and mountains. It is full of large pike. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the river in sub-regions 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain. Hydroelectric project In 2004, a plan by a private company to construct a small hydroelectric plant on the river generated protests by environmentalists, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. The Bureau of Public Hearings on the Environment (BAPE) gave a favorable report on the project in 2004, but said there should be no further development on the river. In August 2005 the Charest government authorized construction of the dam by decree, which would eliminate some famous rapids. The Magpie Generating Station was commissioned in October 2007. It was formally inaugurated on 20 June 2008. In its 2009‚Äì2013 strategic plan, Hydro-Qu√©bec was planning to build six hydroelectric dams on the Magpie. However, in September 2017 the company stated that it had surplus capacity and at present had no plans for the river. Recreational use In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec. The river is popular with white-water rafting, canoeing and kayaking enthusiasts. The lower section of the West Magpie provides of challenging conditions for class IV ‚Äì V whitewater kayak and open boat paddlers. It flows into Lake Magpie north of where the Magpie leaves the lake. From there the river can be handled by most recreational kayakers. The first below the lake has exceptional fishing. The last of the river flows through huge scenic gorges and over waterfalls.

She was named for Joshua Humphreys, a pioneer US shipbuilder. Construction and commissioning Humphreys was launched 28 July 1919 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Letitia A. Humphreys, great-granddaughter of Joshua Humphreys; and commissioned at Philadelphia 21 July 1920, Commander W. Baggaley in command.  1920s  After completing her shakedown training in New England waters, Humphreys sailed 14 August for special duty in the Mediterranean. For the next year she operated primarily in the eastern Mediterranean with Turkish ships, protecting American and Turkish interests in the area during the conflict which followed the Russian Revolution. Humphreys did surveying work and acted as station and communications ship. In November 1920 she evacuated civilians from the Crimea during the last stages of the Russian civil war, and, until August 1921, operated off Palestine, Turkey, and Egypt on maneuvers. She sailed from Constantinople 6 August 1921, arriving Newport, Rhode Island 23 August, and spent the rest of the year in training operations. Humphreys spent the next 2 years on ship and fleet training exercises in Atlantic and Caribbean waters. She sailed 21 January 1925 via the Panama Canal Zone for San Diego, California, and after her arrival 12 March took part in important fleet maneuvers off the California coast. In June she returned to New York and her regular schedule of training in the Caribbean. Humphreys maintained this operational pattern until decommissioning at Philadelphia 10 January 1930, taking part in annual reserve training cruises during the summers 1926‚Äì29.  1930s  Humphreys recommissioned at Philadelphia 13 June 1932, and sailed 15 August for maneuvers on the West Coast. The ship took part in two fleet problems, vital tools in perfecting equipment and tactics, before sailing 19 April 1934 for New York. Upon her arrival 31 May Humphreys resumed her readiness operations on the East Coast, taking part in a fleet exercise off Haiti in October. From the Caribbean the ship returned to San Diego 8 November 1934 and for the next year took part in important carrier training exercises in the Pacific. Acting as screen ship and plane guard, Humphreys helped perfect the tactics of aircraft carrier warfare which were to exert a strong influence on the coming war. She remained on the West Coast, with occasional voyages to Pearl Harbor and Midway, until she was decommissioned at San Diego on 14 September 1938. Humphreys recommissioned once more 26 September 1939 as the beginning of the war in Europe necessitated an increase in America's readiness. Humphreys conducted shakedown off San Diego and sailed 13 November to join the Neutrality Patrol in the Caribbean, designed to protect American shipping. During May and June 1940 the ship took part in a sound school at Newport to improve her antisubmarine capability, and sailed 4 December from Norfolk, Virginia for San Diego, where she arrived 2 days before Christmas. There she continued Neutrality Patrol duty and engaged in antisubmarine training off California.  World War II  Humphreys was in San Diego when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war 7 December 1941. During the critical early months she operated as a coastal escort ship between San Pedro and Seattle, Washington but in May she sailed northward to Kodiak, Alaska, arriving 31 May 1942. In the bleak Aleutian Islands she escorted transports, patrolled American-held islands, and engaged in exercises with Honolulu, Indianapolis, and several destroyers. Humphreys arrived at San Francisco 11 November and entered Mare Island Navy Yard for conversion to high-speed transport. She was reclassified APD-12 on 1 December 1942; and, following shakedown training, arrived at Pearl Harbor 31 December to prepare for duty in the western Pacific. After amphibious training in Hawaiian waters, the ship sailed to Noumea 22 January 1943 and began ferrying troops and supplies from advance bases to Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Island. During these critical months as the ship repeatedly steamed to the Solomon Islands in support of amphibious assaults, she often fought off bombing and strafing attacks by Japanese aircraft. Townsville in May 1943. After training landings Humphreys embarked elements of the 1st Cavalry Division at Noum√©a and transported them to Townsville, Australia, in preparation for Operation Chronicle, landings on Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands. Arriving Townsville 20 May 1943, the ship sailed for Milne Bay 21 June, and from there landed troops and equipment on Woodlark 23 June without enemy opposition. This first landing of the long New Guinea campaign was also the first for Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's 7th Fleet Amphibious Force (\\"VII Phib\\"), and provided invaluable experience for the numerous amphibious operations to come. Humphreys sailed to Brisbane for repairs during July and August, and returned to Milne Bay 15 August 1943. There she prepared for VII Phib's next move up the coast of New Guinea to Lae. After putting their troops ashore early 4 September, the high-speed transports remained off the beach to protect landing craft from Japanese air attack. The Australian troops landed by Humphreys and the other ships soon took Lae, and the ship departed 7 September with casualties for Buna. On the 10th she returned with three other transports for a night sweep of Huon Gulf, driving away supply barges and bombarding Japanese positions around Lae. Next on Barbey's amphibious timetable in New Guinea was Finschhafen, where Humphreys and her sister ships carried out a surprise landing 22 September. After bringing reinforcements 8 days later, the ship took casualties to Buna 8 October and arrived at Goodenough Island 19 October for amphibious exercises. Seizure of New Britain was vital to the advance toward the Philippines as it provided control of the strategic Vitiaz and Dampier Straits. The first step of the operation was to gain control of the harbor at Arawe. Humphreys sailed with other amphibious units for southern New Britain, arriving 15 December; put ashore elements of the 112th Cavalry Regiment in rubber boats to seize harbor islands; then stood offshore to provide gunfire support before retiring to Buna that afternoon. Humphreys also took part in the Cape Gloucester landings 26 December, remaining in the Cape Sudest area into February 1944. She then sailed for the landings in the Admiralties 27 February, arriving off Los Negros 2 days later. Humphreys landed troops at Hyane; steamed to Cape Sudest; and, when resistance stiffened in early March, returned off Hyane with reinforcements. In April the ship began preparations for the three-pronged amphibious attack on central New Guinea, the Hollandia operation. Humphreys landed troops at Humboldt Bay 22 April against light opposition, and remained off the beaches providing gunfire support. Following the assault, she returned to Buna and sailed 12 May for the United States. She arrived at San Francisco 30 May, and was converted to carry \\"frogmen,\\" the Navy's skilled Underwater Demolition Teams. Sailing again 30 July, Humphreys trained in Hawaiian waters before sailing to Manus 28 September to join the invasion fleet for the return to the Philippines. Sailing 12 October, she carried UDT Team No. 5 to the Leyte beaches 18 October, remaining close in to provide fire support during this reconnaissance. Next day she patrolled Leyte Gulf for Japanese submarines, and continued this work during the main landings 20 October 1944. The veteran ship assisted in shooting down a bomber 21 October before sailing in convoy for Manus. The invasion of Luzon was next on Humphreys' schedule. After stopping at Noumea and Hollandia, she sortied from the Palaus 1 January 1945 with the Lingayen invasion group. Steaming through the Philippines the ships encountered suicide attacks and shot down many planes. These attacks became more intense as Humphreys entered Lingayen Gulf 6 January; and next day as her UDT team swam ashore for vital reconnaissance work, the ship provided gunfire cover. She remained in the Gulf until sailing with a convoy 10 January, one day after the main landings. The ship arrived at Ulithi 23 January 1945 and took on a new duty, screening logistics groups during at-sea replenishment and refueling of the wide-ranging carrier striking forces. She screened refueling operations for 5th Fleet escort carriers covering the Iwo Jima landings, then steamed on to Iwo Jima itself 8 March 1945. There Humphreys acted as screening ship until arriving Leyte with a convoy 17 March.  Fate  As an important preliminary to the main landings on Okinawa, Humphreys took part in the assault of Keise Shima 31 March, screening LST's and performing escort duties until 3 April when she sailed for Ulithi. This last and largest of Pacific landings was then well underway, and the ship escorted resupply convoys from Ulithi to bitterly contested Okinawa until returning to Pearl Harbor 4 June 1945. From there she sailed to San Diego where she was reclassified DD-236 on 20 July 1945. Humphreys decommissioned 26 October 1945 and was sold for scrap 26 August 1946 to National Metal & Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, Calif.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 10, 2000. In the episode, Homer, along with his son Bart, con people out of their money in order to pay for Homer's broken car. However, after having paid for the repairs, the two decide to continue grifting, which leads to some troublesome situations. The episode was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Michael Polcino. The episode's title is a parody on The Great Muppet Caper. The episode features American actor Edward Norton as con artist Devon Bradley. In its original American broadcast, the episode received a 9.7 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research. Plot The family goes to a magic- themed restaurant. While there, Marge gets drunk on Long Island Iced Teas and Bart becomes so fascinated with magic that he buys a magician's kit from the gift shop. On the way home, a sturgeon falls from the sky (implicitly from the space station Mir) onto the family car's hood, which is severely damaged. Homer and Bart start their magic show as a way to make money, but the act becomes a failure, and Homer leaves Bart to do the rest of the act on his own. Bart is left out on the street, and people begin giving him money so he can get home on public transportation. As Homer drives home, he sees Bart in a taxi, and when he gets home he sees him eating a steak dinner. They decide they can make money grifting, however Marge and Lisa begin suspecting of them after they \\"worked\\" without Bart's kit, which they both left behind at home. Homer and Bart continue to grift after they have fixed the car, and Grampa volunteers to help them grift, since he was a con-artist during the Great Depression. Grampa, Homer, and Bart grift the residents at the Springfield Retirement Castle. While performing the grift, they are arrested by an FBI agent. When Homer and Bart get to jail, they realize the FBI agent himself is a con man, and conned them out of their money and the car. Homer and Bart say the car was stolen in the church parking lot. The next morning they are surprised however to learn that Groundskeeper Willie was arrested for stealing the car, as he matched the description they gave of the carjacker as a \\"foreign loner with wild, bushy hair\\". Not wanting to admit they were conned, Homer and Bart go along with Marge's theory. At the trial, the Blue Haired Lawyer leads Homer to say that it was Willie who stole the car. After Willie is proven guilty, he snatches Wiggum's gun and shoots Principal Skinner. At this point Homer finally confesses that he got conned but Marge and the townspeople themselves tell Homer and Bart that they set up the trial and the carjacking to teach them a lesson on conning people, revealing that Skinner was not really shot (it was a fake blood pack), the judge was Grampa wearing a latex mask, and the con man who stole their car was an actor called Devon Bradley. As Lisa is ready to explain why the town, media and police officials had \\"nothing better to do\\" than show them the consequences of their actions, Otto runs through the courtroom doors, shouting, 'Surf's Up!'. The scene then cuts to Springfield at the beach, with characters from the episode surfing, including the waiter from the restaurant, the two astronauts from the Mir space station and the sturgeon swimming in the sea. Production Carolyn Omine wrote the episode. \\"The Great Money Caper\\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Michael Polcino.

Commentary for \\"The Great Money Caper\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Originally, the episode would be about pool hustling, however as writing ensued, the script went through several incarnations until the Simpsons writers settled on the grifting story seen in the episode. Omine read several books about grifters for preparation for writing the episode. The other writers also prepared themselves by watching several heist films, including House of Games, Paper Moon and The Sting, the latter two of which are referenced in the episode. For example, the revelation that Devon Bradley, the FBI agent in the episode who is revealed to be a con artist, was inspired by such films.Omine, Carolyn. (2009). Commentary for \\"The Great Money Caper\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In a scene in the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only to end up in another gift shop. The scene was based on an experience of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck trying to come up with an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode. =Casting= Edward Norton guest-starred as Devon Bradley in the episode. A scene that was eventually dropped from the episode featured Robby Krieger, guitarist of the American rock band The Doors, as himself. Krieger had been promised a guest role on The Simpsons after the staff were allowed to use the Doors song \\"The End\\" for the season 11 episode \\"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\\". However, during production, Scully thought that the scene stood out too much and that Krieger's cameo felt \\"too obviously shoe- horned in,\\" so the scene ended up being cut from the episode. The scene was later included in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season DVD set. To this day, Krieger has not officially been featured in an episode of The Simpsons. The con artist Devon Bradley was portrayed by American actor and director Edward Norton. Scully hired Norton for the role after James L. Brooks, one of The Simpsons' producers, told Scully that Norton was \\"a big fan of the show\\" and was willing to guest star in an episode. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Scully noted that Norton was very versatile and could imitate many Simpsons characters perfectly. The announcer at the \\"Magic Palace\\" who says the line \\"Folks, this is not part of the act\\" was voiced by Scully. According to him, the line was \\"a last-minute addition\\" to the episode. Cultural references The episode's plot is loosely based on the American comedy film Paper Moon, which was also the inspiration for Bart and Homer's swindle of Ned Flanders in the episode. The title of the episode is a parody of the 1981 film The Great Muppet Caper. The title was pitched by Simpsons writer Matt Selman. The episode's ending lampoons the cliche of having twist endings at the end of heist films.Selman, Matt. (2009). Commentary for \\"The Great Money Caper\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. ‚ÄùMagic Palace‚Äù, the magic-themed restaurant that the Simpsons visit in the beginning of the episode, is a parody on The Magic Castle, a nightclub in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles, California. Marge's line \\"I didn't say that for clapping\\" is a reference to a speech given by John Wayne while he was intoxicated. Homer wants to buy a singing rubber fish after their first con. At the end of the episode, Bart exclaims ‚ÄúCowabunga!‚Äù, a catch-phrase of the main characters in the animated television series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Jean, Al. (2009). Commentary for \\"The Great Money Caper\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the scene where Grampa joins Bart and Homer, Grampa mentions the film The Sting II. Reception In its original American broadcast on December 10, 2000, \\"The Great Money Caper\\" received a 9.7 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, meaning it was seen by 9.7% of the population at the time of its broadcast. Among children, the episode was watched by 2.8 million viewers. In his review of The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season DVD box set, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide praised the episode. He wrote that, unlike other episodes in the season, \\"The Great Money Caper\\" did not \\"rely on too many gimmicks\\" and therefore felt more realistic, even though he does not consider grifting an \\"everyday activity.\\" He concluded his review by writing that the episode \\"does well for itself.\\" Jason Bailey of DVD Talk described the episode as being one of the season's highlights. However, Matt Haigh of Den of Geek cited \\"The Great Money Caper\\" as one of the worst episodes of the season, as well as the whole series. In his review, Haigh criticized the Simpsons writers for not making sense of the story, and denounced the episode's ending for being \\"abrupt\\".

He spent his entire career at the papal Courts of Sixtus IV, Innocent VIII, Alexander VI, Pius III, and Julius II, serving as papal Master of Ceremonies, a position from which he was able to observe most of the important events of the period. Early life He was born at Niederhaslach, now Bas-Rhin, Alsace, France. Of humble origins, he was educated by the collegial chapter of St. Florent in Niederhaslach. He took the degree Doctor of Canon Law (Decretorum Doctor, as he proclaims in his preface to his Ordo Missae), and then, on 4 June 1477, was able to purchase the bourgeois citizenship of Strasbourg.Thumser, in: Burchard, Diarium III, p. ii-iii. He eventually became secretary to Jean Wegeraufft, the Vicar General of the Bishop of Strasbourg, Ruppert von Simmern.Lesellier, p. 12. Suspected of trafficking in dispensations from publishing marriage banns, theft of a sword and of a florin, he left his position with the Vicar about 1467. He went to Rome, where he was awarded the expectation of a benefice in Strasbourg, but it was contested in Strasbourg; Burchard won his case before the Roman Rota (court of appeal), but the authorities in Strasbourg refused to recognize the ruling, citing Burchard's previous misdeeds. In Rome, Burchard twice admitted his misdeeds to the authorities, but his standing seems not to have suffered.Setton, Kenneth M. The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571, American Philosophical Society, 1978 , at p. 389.Lesellier, pp. 12-13; 34-35 (Burchard's confession of 10 April 1475). Setton is wrong in claiming that Burchard was not a Doctor of Canon Law, \\"and did not in fact use the title.\\" He used the title on the first page of his Ordo Missae. Burchard was ordained a priest in 1476.  Roman career  Burchard arrived in Rome in November 1481.Celani, I, p. xii. He first practiced as a lawyer in the Roman Curia.Thuasne, in: Burchard, Diarium, III, p. v. He became a Protonotary Apostolic in February 1481/82, and was appointed Master of Ceremonies to Pope Sixtus IV on 29 November 1483, having bought the office for 450 ducats, with the assistance of Agostino Patrizi, whose colleague he became.Burchard, John. The Diary of John Burchard, (Arnold Harris Matthew, trans.), Vol. 1, London, Francis Griffiths, 1910 Celani, I, p. xiii. He held it until his death on 16 May 1506, successively acting as Ceremoniere to Innocent VIII (1484‚Äì1492), Alexander VI (1492‚Äì1503), Pius III (1503) and during the early years of Julius II. On the day of his election, 29 August 1484, Pope Innocent was conducted to his new apartments in the Vatican Palace by the Master of Ceremonies. Burchard took the opportunity, a completely appropriate one, to ask the new Pope for the office of Papal Chamberlain. The Pope replied that he would think about it. Burchard did not pursue the matter, and nothing was done.Burchard, Diarium, I, p. 71. In 1490 Burchard was given a leave of absence to return to Strasbourg by Pope Innocent VIII, to begin on 29 June. His diary does not resume until 8 August 1491.Setton, p. 417, note 2. In Rome, Burchard joined the Confraternity of Santa Maria dell'Anima and quickly rose to become its provost. It was while he held the office of Praefectus fabricae that the decision was taken to rebuild the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima as part of the celebration of the Jubilee of 1500.The decision was taken at a meeting of the Brotherhood on 24 and 25 September 1499; the rebuilding took nearly two decades. The cornerstone was laid by Matthias Lang, the German ambassador and future cardinal, on 11 April 1500.Setton, p. 541. The church was built in the style of a Hallenkirche that was typical for Northern Europe. Andrea Sansovino was retained as architect by the confraternity. The facade was completed by Giuliano da Sangallo. Burchard accumulated an array of ecclesiastical benefices in Alsace, including that of the Provost of St. Marien (Basel) (in German) (1475), and Provost of Strasbourg. He was a Canon of the Collegiate Church of S. Thomas in Strasbourg, by papal provision, granted on 31 October 1479.Thuasne, in: Burchard, Diarium, III, p. iii. He was also Provost of Basel (1484),On the day of his election as Pope, Innocent VIII issued a motu proprio for Johann Burchard's benefit, providing him to the office of Provost of S. Maria s. Genulfi in Basel. Burchard, Diarium, I, p. 69. and then Dean of Basel (1501).Burchard, Diarium, II, p. 346. Among the significant events organised by Burchard as Ceremoniere were: the visit of Don Federigo de Aragon to Rome (December 1493 to January 1494); the coronation of Alfonso II of Naples (May 1494); the reception of Charles VIII of France in Rome (November 1494 to February 1495); the Papal Embassy to the Emperor Maximilian in Milan (July‚ÄìNovember 1496); the Proclamation of the Jubilee (Christmas 1499); the visit of Alexander VI to Piombino (January‚ÄìMarch 1502); and obsequies of Pope Alexander VI (August 1503). Burchard was also present at the laying of the foundation stone of the new Basilica of St. Peter on 18 April 1506. Burchard was promoted Bishop of the diocese of Orte and Civit√† Castellana on 3 October 1503 by Pope Pius III, in acknowledgment of more than twenty years of service as First Master of Ceremonies. He had been promised the bishopric of Nepi and Sutri, as Pius was reminded by Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, but the new pope had already promised that diocese to Antonio de' Alberici. Orte was therefore substituted. Burchard retired in May 1504.The bulls of his appointment and installation were delayed by the death of Pius III, and actually issued by Pope Julius II on 29 November 1503, four weeks after his election. Eubel, II, p. 211, with note 4. Burchard, Diarium, III, p. 281. In the Roman Curia Burchard was a cleric of the Papal Chapel, an Abbreviator of Papal Letters, and Dean of the Cathedral of Basel at the time of his promotion to the See of Orte. Burchard's successor, Paris de Grassis, had already been nominated by the time of the conclave of 1503, in anticipation of Burchard's retirement. In June 1504 Burchard paid a brief visit to his new diocese, and returned again from 4 July until mid-August. He was back in Rome on 15 August for the commemoration of Pope Alexander VI, and then returned again to his diocese, until 8 October 1504.Thuasne, in: Burchard, Diarium, III, p. xliv, who states that the first visit lasted 2 1/2 weeks, and that Burchard was back in Rome on 27 June for a cardinal's funeral. In 1505 Burchard suffered an attack of \\"goutte\\", which kept him confined to his room. Thuasne notices that from this point the entries in his diary are less regular and without the usual historical detail as earlier.Thuasne, in: Burchard, Diarium, III, p. xliv. On 21 April 1506, Pope Julius II signed the document appointing Burchard to the office of Abbreviator de Parco Majore in the Papal Curia, for which Burchard had paid 2,400 ducats.Burchard, Diarium, III, p. 424. In Thuasne's biography at p. xlvi, the office is said to have been that of Abbreviator de Parco Minore. : \\"Abbreviators, in the chancery of Rome, are officers whose business, according to Champini, is to draw up the pope's briefs, and reduce the petitions granted by the pontiff into proper form. The abbreviators constitute a college of seventy-two persons, divided into two parks, or ranks ; the one called abbreviatores de parco majore, who are twelve in number, and all prelates; the other, abbreviatores de parco minore, called also examinatores, who may be all lay-men.\\" Joannes Burchard died on Saturday evening, 16 May 1506.Burchard, Diarium III, p. 426 (by Paris de Grassis). He was buried in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo at the Flaminian Gate.  Historical importance  Burchard's importance derives from his Liber Notarum, a form of official record of the more significant papal ceremonies with which he was involved. The first volume of the first critical edition of this work was published by E. Celani in 1906 as Johannis Burckardi Liber Notarum ab anno MCCCCLXXXIII usque ad annum MDVI. A second volume followed (1911). Celani's edition collated various earlier printed editions of the work, and a collection of uncertain notations, with Burchard's original manuscript, thereby establishing an important critical edition of this account of the papal court at the end of the fifteenth century. As Ceremoniere, he was responsible for the publication of a revised edition of the Liber Pontificalis in 1485, and, along with Agostino Patrizi, for the publication of a new edition of the Caeremoniale Episcoporum in 1488.Sherr, p. 128. Perhaps Burchard's most enduring publication was the Ordo Servandus per Sacerdotem in celebratione Missae, published under orders from Pope Alexander VI. This book went through numerous editions before its substance eventually made its way into the Normae Generales of the Roman Missal. Quote: \\"At the beginning of the sixteenth century, John Burckard (+ 1506), a famous papal master of ceremonies, drew up -- using the Ordines of the Papal Court and the Vatican MSS. of Sacramentaries and Missals -- and published in 1502, by order of Alexander VI, an Ordo Missae. It is from this that some of the general rubrics of our present Missal are drawn, and the Ritus servandus of our Missal embodies the greater part of Burckard's Ordo.\\" His diary records an alleged orgy known as the Banquet of Chestnuts, held by Cesare Borgia in the Papal Palace on 30 October 1501.Burkhard, Liber Notarum II (ed. Celani), p. 303. In his note, Celani accepts the story, though not perhaps all of its vivid detail. Mandell Creighton accepts the story as basically true, and he cites the corroborative evidence of a dispatch of the Florentine Ambassador, Francesco Pepi. Maria Bellonci also seems to accept the story. However, Picotti believes the diary should be regarded with some caution regarding entries concerning the Borgias, since it is fairly apparent that Burchard disliked the Borgias.Setton, p. 390 column 2; citing: G. B. Picotti, \\"Nuovi Studi e documenti intorno a papa Alessandro VI,\\" Rivista di storia della Chiesa in Italia, V (1951), pp. 169-262, at 173-180. Burchard's immediate successor as First Master of Ceremonies, Paris de Grassis, left a frank comment on Burchard's character at the beginning of his private ceremonial Diary:J.J.J. von D√∂llinger, \\"Das Pontificat Julius' II.,\\" in: Beitr√§ge zur politischen, kirchlichen, und Cultur-Geschichte III. Band. (Wien 1882), p. 364. Licet autem novus et inexpertus sim tanquam asinus ad liram, conabor sic per crebras actiones et per annales actiones evadere, ut officio meo satisfaciam. Sic quaeso, uti in hoc principio, dum gesta tantorum patrum exequar et describam, non irrideant mea scripta maligni detractores, praesertim ille meus collega Johannes Burchardus, multo magis socius in officio quam amicus meus in charitate, quae nulla est in eo. Nam cum me intellexit ad officum aspirasse, illico omnes conatus in me, quos potuit et quos scivit ac plus quam potuit et scivit, exasperavit, ut me ejiceret. > Granted however new and untried I may be, like an ass at the lyre, I shall > try to do my duty satisfactorily through frequent efforts and entries year > by year. And so I ask that at this beginning as I am recording and > explaining the actions of so many prelates, ill-wishing detractors not laugh > at my writings, especially my colleague Johannes Burchard, who is much more > of an associate in my office than my friend in charity, of which there is > none in him. For when he realized that I aspired to his job, from that point > he tried everything against me that he had the power and the knowledge to > do, and more, and strove to get me dismissed. The Liber Notarum is still maintained by the papal Ceremoniere. Though he only described musical details when in the context of innovations or mishaps, his account is an important source for details of papal choir singing. Among other details, he noted the use of polyphony in settings of the Passion, a practice apparently introduced from Spain, and the performance of the now-lost motet Gaude Roma vetus, written in honor of Pope Alexander VI to a text by Johannes Tinctoris. Burchard's residence, built in 1491, survives and can be seen at Via del Sudario 44, in Rome. Burchard was also known as \\"Argentinus\\" from the Latin name for Strasbourg, and the tower on his palace gave the name \\"Torre Argentina\\" to the district, still retained in the Largo di Torre Argentina and other names. In popular culture Johann Burchard was portrayed by Ralph Nossek in the 1981 BBC-RAI production TV series The Borgias, by Simon McBurney in the 2011 Showtime series The Borgias, by Victor Schef√© in the 2011 French- German series Borgia, and by Shawn Shillingford in the 2018 CNN series Pope: The Most Powerful Man in History.

History The first inhabitants of the area were the Tkai'waichash-hlama, a band or tribe of Native American people who lived along Cowiche Creek. The area was settled in the late nineteenth century by farmers who relied upon crops that did not require irrigation, such as wheat, barley, rye, and grazing cattle. Homesteading in Cowiche was difficult since fields had to be cleared of volcanic rock before they could be tilled and there was little rainfall in summer. In 1906, construction began on the Tieton Irrigation Project, a division of the broader Yakima Project. Irrigation water became available in 1907, and shortly thereafter, orchards began to replace wheatfields.

In the , West End had a population of 9,474 people. The Aboriginal name for the area is Kurilpa, which means place of the water rat. Geography Geographically, West End is bounded by the Brisbane River to the west and the south. Hill End is a neighbourhood () within West End in the south-west of the suburb near the Brisbane River. West End is adjacent to the suburbs of South Brisbane and Highgate Hill. These three suburbs make up a peninsula of the Brisbane River. History Before the arrival of Europeans in West End, there was an aboriginal camp in the area around upper part of Musgrave Park where Brisbane State High School now stands. Boundary Street in West End and in Spring Hill were named due to the policy of preventing the Jagera and Turrbal peoples from being within the boundaries of the British settlement at night. The entire riverbank in the West End area was covered with impenetrable rain forest. This was described as a ‚Äútangled mass of trees, vines, flowering creepers, staghorns, elkhorns, towering scrub palms, giant ferns, and hundreds of other varieties of the fern family, beautiful and rare orchids, and the wild passion flower‚Äù. Along the river bank itself were sandy beaches, water lilies in thousands and dangling convolvulus. Bush rats or fawn-footed melomys existed in large numbers in the rain forest and were hunted by driving them into nets. They were roasted and eaten by women only. They featured in various dreaming tales and tribal lore. The Aboriginal place name of Kurilpa derives from the name Kureel-pa meaning place of water rats. The name is still used for various local local places, buildings and institutions in West End and South Brisbane area, e.g. West End was located in the former Electoral District of Kurilpa. West End was named by early British settlers who after West End of London. European settlers took advantage of the fertile soil to establish farms and orchards. There were strawberry farms where for an entry fee, visitors could eat all they wanted. A creek ran down from the Dornoch Terrace area into a reservoir at the corner of Melbourne and Manning streets from where water was sold. After heavy rain, this creek caused local flooding in West End. There was a spring near the site of the Boundary Hotel which was used by residents from the south side of Brisbane to collect water with long queues forming in dry periods. Flood waters surround the West End Brewery in 1890 There was industrial development along Montague Road, including the South Brisbane Gas Works, sawmills and a steam joinery. On 16 August 1875 three schools opened: West End Boys State School, West End Girls State School and West End Infants State School, with a total of 236 pupils. On 30 June 1936 the boys' and girls' schools were merged creating West End State School. The infants' school was merged into West End State School on 16 December 1994. The farms and orchards were steadily subdivided into suburban allotments which were popular due to the proximity of West End to the city, the river breezes and improving public transport. West End to New Farm tram, ca 1900 West End was one of the first suburbs of Brisbane to be serviced by a tram line, being opened in 1885. Initially the tram was horse-drawn and terminated in Boundary Street, but in 1897 the line was electrified and extended to the corner of Hardgrave Road and Hoogley Street, via Vulture Street. It was subsequently extended down Hoogley Street to the ferry terminus at the end of Hoogley Street in 1925. The tram line closed on 13 April 1969. St Peter's Anglican Church was dedicated on 11 September 1888 by Archdeacon Nathaniel Dawes. The church was at 14 Mitchell Street (). Its closure on 24 April 1995 was approved by Archbishop Peter Hollingworth. The site is now an apartment complex. The West End Library opened in 1925. The foundation stone for St Francis of Assisi Catholic Church was laid on 10 June 1923 by the Apostolic Delegate, Monsignor Bartolomeo Cattaneo. On 26 November 1923 it was opened and blessed by Archbishop James Duhig. It was quickly realised that the site would not be large enough to build a school, so in 1926 an site immediately across the road from the church was purchased and the church building relocated to the new site (now 47-59 Dornoch Terrace ). On 22 January 1928 St Francis' Catholic Primary School opened adjacent to the church by Archbishop Duhig; the school was operated by the Sisters of Mercy with 113 students on the opening day. In 1928 a convent and a presbytery were also built on the larger site. The school closed in 1974 due to the changing demographics of the area. The Dornoch Terrace Bridge was completed in 1941, replacing an older bridge across Boundary Street built in 1888. The 1941 bridge was a precursor to a new bridge across the Brisbane River to the University of Queensland, which was never built. The 2017 University of Queensland Master Plan is still calling for a bridge from West End. The former Tristram's Drink Factory at 79 Boundary Street was built in 1928 and is one of Australia's best examples of the Mission Revival Style architecture. It was converted into a market in the 1990s and remains a heritage landmark of West End.Brisbane Between the Wars . A History by Design. In 1988 the Brisbane School of Distance Education was established at 405 Montague Road. It was the amalgamation of the Primary Correspondence School (opened on 24 January 1922), the Secondary Correspondence School (opened in 1958) and the Preschool Correspondence (opened in 1974). It relocated to Coorparoo in 2011. Scenes for the feature film Jucy (2010) were shot at the now-defunct video store Trash Video in the suburb.'Jucy Duo a Hit With Clive Owen', Courier Mail, Sept 14, 2010 The suburb was affected by the 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods as the Brisbane River broke its banks. From 11 January low-lying areas of the suburb and other places in Brisbane were evacuated. In the , West End had a population of 9,474 people. Heritage listings Kurilpa Library in Boundary Street, 2005 The Dornoch Terrace Bridge over Boundary Street, 2015 West End has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 19 Bank Street: Astrea * 178 Boundary Road: Kurilpa Library * Dornoch Terrace: Dornoch Terrace Bridge * 15 Gray Road: Wanda Walha * 30 Sussex Street: Brighton Terrace * 37 Gray Road: Nassagaweya * 277 Montague Road: Gas Stripping Tower * 321 Montague Road: West End Gasworks * 406 Montague Road: Thomas Dixon Centre Demography In the , West End had a population of 8,061 people; 50% male (4,029 males) and 50% female (4,032 females). Just over half (52.4%) of households were family households, 34.6% were single person households and 13.1% were group households. The median age of the West End population was 35 years, 2 years below the Australian median. Children aged under 15 years made up 11.5% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 8.8% of the population. The suburb has traditionally been home to Brisbane's largest Greek community, with an estimated 75% of Brisbane's Greek population living in West End by 1980. The most common ancestries in West End are English 20.6%, Australian 16.8%, Irish 10.1%, Scottish 8.0% and Greek 5.2%. Indigenous Australians make up 1.5% of the population of West End. For this reason, West End has often been cited as one of Brisbane's most successful multicultural areas. 56.6% of people living in West End were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%. The other top responses for country of birth were England 4.5%, New Zealand 3.4%, Vietnam 2.7%, Greece 2.7% and India 1.4%. 66.4% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were Greek 5.9%, Vietnamese 3.3%, Mandarin 2.0%, Cantonese 1.4% and Spanish 1.1%. The most common religious affiliation was \\"No Religion\\" (35.3%); the next most common responses were Catholic 16.5%, Anglican 8.1%, Eastern Orthodox 7.4% and Buddhism 5.2%. In recent times, students and academics have moved into West End, taking advantage of the area's proximity to the University of Queensland, Griffith University Southbank (including Queensland Conservatorium) and Nathan campuses and the QUT. West End's inner city location has also attracted many young professionals to the area. Along with the influx of students and young professionals, there has been a growing number of cafes, restaurants, and bars - many with an ethnic, vegetarian or organic emphasis. With these changes, West End is widely seen as Brisbane's home for a younger \\"chic\\" or \\"hipster\\" crowd. Planning and development Just over 50% of the dwellings are standalone houses and 37% are higher density residential properties, including multi-storey blocks of apartments and units. Some houses are covered by historic preservation laws seeking to preserve the historical character e.g. tin roofing. Contrasting sharply with the historic homes are new buildings of contemporary designs. Prices for all types of properties have been increasing dramatically in recent decades. According to REIQ, the median unit/town-house price in West End for 2005 is $310,000, and the median house price is $490,500.REIQ Suburb profile - West End A flood flag map for West End can be found at the Brisbane City Council website.Flood Flag Map for West End In May 2012, it was announced that the South Brisbane Riverside Neighbourhood Plan would be resubmitted to allow the construction of 12 storey buildings, considerably higher than the previous seven storey limit. According to the Brisbane City Council's Neighbourhood Planning chairwoman, Amanda Cooper, there are six sites located between Montague Road and the Brisbane River, south of Davies Park, which are at least one-hectare in area, a requirement for construction of the increased building heights. The nature of some developments has led to community disquiet. The redevelopment of the Absoe site is a high-profile example. Economy West End street art and cafe thumb The area's major attraction is its caf√© and restaurant scene, as well as its shopping, which is centred along Boundary Street. It is also known for its high concentration of ethnic and organic grocery stores. Davies Park on the riverside hosts one of the largest farmer's markets in Greater Brisbane every Saturday called the Green Flea Markets. Weekend 'brunch' culture is prevalent in West End, with numerous cafes and restaurants serving the area. West End has an industrial backbone, in particular, along Montague Road down to Riverside Drive. Given the value of riverside property now that flooding is better managed, factories are now being sold to make way for upscale waterfront apartments. This is part of a plan to increase population densities in near-city suburbs. It will significantly affect the ability of working- class people to remain in the area and change the economic make-up of the area. As such, West End is currently undergoing urban renewal, with a large change in real estate prices, and new development changing the area demographic.  Education  West End State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 24 Vulture Street (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 1021 students with 71 teachers (61 full-time equivalent) and 32 non-teaching staff (23 full-time equivalent). In 2017 plans to expand the school's site were announced following a purchase of an adjacent block of land. There is no secondary school in West End. The nearest secondary school is Brisbane State High School in neighbouring South Brisbane to the east. This school is known for its academic excellence and demand for places outstrips supply. However students within its local catchment area are always able to attend this school, which drives up the price of real estate in suburbs within the catchment like West End as parents seek to buy or rent within the catchment to obtain enrolment in the school. Transport The West End ferry wharf was destroyed in the 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods The suburb is well serviced by buses and ferries. Bus services include Route 199 BUZ to New Farm-City-West End Ferry, leaving every five minutes during peak times, Route 192 University of Queensland to City, Route 198 Highgate Hill Hail & Ride (Coles West End-PA Hospital-Woolloongabba-Vulture St-Coles West End) and a City Glider service along Montague Road. CityCat services leave from the West End ferry wharf in Orleigh Street. The ferry terminal was destroyed in the 2011 floods. It was replaced and operating on 24 July 2011. Electronically secured BCC bicycle sheds exist near the West End Ferry Terminal and on Montague Road. Culture Street installation, 2007 Since 1976, West End has hosted the annual Paniyiri Festival at Musgrave Park. Musgrave Park is located on the eastern boundary in the suburb of South Brisbane. The festival provides an opportunity for the Greek community to share its culture with the rest of Australia. It is Queensland's longest running cultural festival and the longest running Greek festival in Australia. Also held in Musgrave Park is the annual fair day of the Brisbane Pride Festival. West End has a number of galleries and Artist-run initiative which showcase the works of local artists. The neighbouring suburb of South Brisbane, the designated cultural precinct of Brisbane, is home to some of Queensland's most well-regarded cultural education institutions, such as the Queensland College of Art, the Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University, Queensland Performing Arts Centre. However, as Southbank is primarily commercial, many artists and students live in the much larger and residential West End. The Brisbane City Council operates a public library at 178-180 Boundary Street (currently known as West End Library but previously known as Kurilpa Library). Sport Queensland Cup rugby league team, the Souths Logan Magpies, play their home games at Davies Park, West End (Bill Tyquin Oval). Prior to 2003, it was the famous Souths Magpies who graced the hallowed Davies Park field and legendary players such as Mal Meninga, Gary Belcher, Peter Jackson, Mick Veivers, Greg Veivers, Harold 'Mick' Crocker, Frank Drake, Mitch Brennan, Bob Linder, Ash Lumby, Norm Carr, Richo Hill and Chris Phelan wore the black and white of the club. Current ARLC Chief John Grant was another ex-Souths player, representing Australia from the club, while legendary rugby league coach Wayne Bennett was a premiership-winning mentor with the Magpies in the mid-1980s. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Magpies were an institution in West End and their 1981 and 1985 Brisbane Rugby League grand final victories transformed the suburb into a party town. Along the river bank of Milton Reach can be found the rowing sheds of a number of Brisbane secondary schools such as Brisbane Grammar School and Brisbane State High School, as well as rowing clubs. Amongst these is the Commercial Rowing club. It was established in 1877 and is Queensland‚Äôs oldest amateur sporting club. The South Brisbane Sailing Club has its club house near Orleigh Park. The club was established in 1903 and has been located in West End since 1956.

Bazilian (born July 21, 1953), is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, arranger and producer, best known for being a founding member of the rock band The Hooters and for writing \\"One of Us,\\" made famous by Joan Osborne in 1995. Early life Eric Michael Bazilian was born at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia to a father who was a psychiatrist and a mother who was a concert pianist. He is Jewish. He began playing the piano at age five, and his uncle taught him guitar at nine. He never took formal musical lessons. At the age of 10, while watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, Bazilian realized that playing and creating music was what he wished to pursue with his life. At 16 years old, while attending Germantown Friends School, Bazilian started writing songs for his first band, Evil Seed. This band played all original music at \\"Be-ins\\" at Belmont Plateau in Fairmount Park. By the mid 1970s, while attending the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, Bazilian met Rob Hyman and Rick Chertoff, with whom he formed a band called Baby Grand. They would release two albums during their tenure. Tenure with The Hooters After Baby Grand disbanded, Hyman and Bazilian decided to try something new by combining reggae, ska, and rock'n'roll to create The Hooters in 1980. Nervous Night, The Hooters' 1985 debut on Columbia Records, sold more than 2 million copies and included Billboard Top 40 hits \\"Day By Day\\" (#18), \\"And We Danced\\" (#21) and \\"Where Do The Children Go\\" (#38). After releasing six albums, The Hooters obtained a large global following throughout the 1980s and 1990s. As a result, they were asked to open three major musical events of the late 20th century: Live Aid in Philadelphia in 1985, Amnesty International Concert at Giants Stadium in 1986, and Roger Waters' The Wall Concert in Berlin in 1990. In 1995, The Hooters went on hiatus, although Hyman and Bazilian would continue to collaborate on musical projects for other artists. Bazilian reunited with The Hooters on successful headlining European summer tours in 2003, 2004, and 2005. 2007 saw the release of Time Stand Still, their first album of new material since 1993. In 2009, they released \\"Both Sides Live\\", a double CD which featured a concert at Philadelphia's Electric Factory as well as a special acoustic performance recorded at Rob Hyman's Elm Street Studios. In 2010, to celebrate 30 years as a band, they released a five song EP entitled \\"Five By Five\\", produced by Nick Jameson. The EP featured the only \\"official\\" studio recordings by the band of Rob Hyman's \\"Time After Time\\" and Bazilian's \\"One of Us\\". The Hooters continue to tour successfully in Germany and Scandinavia and perform special concert events in their native Philadelphia. \\"One of Us\\" Bazilian has become recognized internationally for being a songwriter, session musician, arranger, and producer for many artists. In 1995, he played all those roles for Joan Osborne's major-label debut album Relish, which was nominated for six Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year for the No. 4 Billboard hit \\"One of Us,\\" which Bazilian wrote. \\"One of Us\\" has since been covered by many artists throughout the world, among them being Prince, Doctor Evil in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Martyn Joseph, Scott Bradoka, Sharla Jackson Band, Wildside, Jackie \\"O\\", DJ Irene, Outta Control, Seal and in 2020 Australian singer Greg Gould recorded a version featuring Eric Bazilian on Guitars and Backing vocals. In 2003, \\"One of Us\\" was used as the theme song for the CBS television series Joan of Arcadia. It has also appeared on the soundtracks of numerous movies, including Vanilla Sky (2001), Bruce Almighty, (2003) and Diary of a Mad Black Woman (2005). In more recent years, The Hooters have also performed \\"One of Us\\" in their live shows. Recognitions On November 17, 2000, Bazilian was inducted into the Philadelphia Walk of Fame on the Avenue of the Arts. On April 21, 2004, Bazilian won an ASCAP Film and Television Music Award for \\"One of Us\\" as the theme song for the CBS television series Joan of Arcadia.

It was located in the captaincy of Pernambuco, in what is today the Brazilian state of Alagoas. Background The modern tradition has been to call the community the Quilombo of Palmares. Quilombos were settlements mainly of survivors and free-born enslaved African people. The quilombos came into existence when Africans began arriving in Brazil in the mid-1530s and grew significantly as slavery expanded. No contemporary document called Palmares a quilombo; instead the term mocambo was used.Jane Landers. \\"Leadership and Authority in Maroon Settlements in Spanish America and Brazil.\\" in Africa and the Americas: Interconnections During the Slave Trade. Jos√© C. Curto and Ren√©e Soulodre-LaFrance, eds. 2005. p. 178fn31 (p. 183‚Äì184) . Palmares was home to not only escaped enslaved Africans, but also to mulattos, caboclos, Indians and poor whites, especially Portuguese soldiers trying to escape forced military service.Africans in Brazil Overview One estimate places the population of Palmares in the 1690s at around 20,000 inhabitants, although recent scholarship has questioned whether this figure is exaggerated. Stuart Schwartz places the number at roughly 11,000, noting that it was, regardless, \\"undoubtedly the largest fugitive community to have existed in Brazil\\". These inhabitants developed a society and government that derived from a range of Central African sociopolitical models, a reflection of the diverse ethnic origins of its inhabitants. This government was confederate in nature, and was led by an elected chief who allocated landholdings, appointed officials (usually family members), and resided in a type of fortification called Macoco. Six Portuguese expeditions tried to conquer Palmares between 1680 and 1686, but failed. Finally the governor of the captaincy of Pernambuco, Pedro Almeida, organized an army under the leadership of the Bandeirantes Domingos Jorge Velho and Bernardo Vieira de Melo and defeated a palmarista force, putting an end to the republic in 1694.\\"Palmares\\", Britannica Online. Formative period (1620-53) Palmares was the general name given by the Portuguese in Pernambuco and Alagoas to the interior districts beyond the settlements on the coast, especially the mountain ranges, because there were many palm trees there. As early as 1602, Portuguese settlers complained to the government that their captives were running away into this inaccessible region and building mocambos, or small communities. However, the Portuguese were unable to dislodge these communities, which were probably small and scattered, and so expeditions continued periodically into the interior. During this time the vast majority of the enslaved Africans who were brought to Pernambuco were from Portuguese Angola, perhaps as many as 90%, and therefore it is no surprise that tradition, reported as early as 1671 related that its first founders were Angolan. This large number was primarily because the Portuguese used the colony of Angola as a major raiding base, and there was a close relationship between the holders of the contract of Angola, the governors of Angola, and the governors of Pernambuco. In 1630 the Dutch West India Company sent a fleet to conquer Pernambuco, in the context of the Dutch-Portuguese War, during the period of the Iberian Union. Although they captured and held the city of Recife, they were unable (and generally unwilling) to conquer the rest of the province. As a result, there was a constant low-intensity war between Dutch and Portuguese settlers. During this time thousands of enslaved people escaped and went to the Palmares. Although initially the Dutch considered making an alliance with Palmares against the Portuguese, peace agreements put them in the position of supporting the sugar plantation economy of Pernambuco. Consequently, the Dutch leader John Maurice of Nassau decided to send expeditions against Palmares. These expeditions also collected intelligence about them, and it is from these accounts that we learn about the organization of Palmares in their time. By the 1640s, many of the mocambos had consolidated into larger entities ruled by kings. Dutch descriptions by Caspar Barlaeus (published 1647) and Johan Nieuhof (published 1682) spoke of two larger consolidated entities, \\"Great Palmares\\" and \\"Little Palmares\\". In each of these units there was a large central town that was fortified and held 5,000-6,000 people. The surrounding hills and valleys were filled with many more mocambos of 50 to 100 people. A description of the visit of Johan Blaer to one of the larger mocambos in 1645 (which had been abandoned) revealed that there were 220 buildings in the community, a church, four smithies, and a council house. Churches were common in Palmares partly because Angolans were frequently Christianized, either from the Portuguese colony or from the Kingdom of Kongo, which was a Christianized country at that time. Others had been converted to Christianity while enslaved. According to the Dutch, they used a local person who knew something of the church as a priest, though they did not think he practiced the religion in its usual form.John Thornton, \\"Les Etats de l'Angola et la formation de Palmares (Bresil)\\" Annales Histoire, Science Sociales, 63.4 (2008): 760-97. From Palmares to Angola Janga After 1654 the Dutch were expelled, and the Portuguese began organizing expeditions against the mocambos of Palmares. In the post-Iberian Union period (after 1640), the kingdoms of Palmares grew and became even more consolidated. Two descriptions, one an anonymous account called \\"Rela√ß√£o das Guerras de Palmares\\" (1678) (Account of the war of Palmares), the other written by Manuel Injosa (1677), describe a large consolidated entity with nine major settlements and many smaller ones. Slightly later accounts tell us that the kingdom was named \\"Angola Janga\\" which according to the Portuguese meant \\"Little Angola,\\" although this is not a direct translation from a Kimbundu term as one might expect. The two texts agree that it was ruled by a king, which the \\"Rela√ß√£o das Guerras\\" named \\"Ganga Zumba\\" and that members of his family ruled other settlements, suggesting an incipient royal family. He also had officials and judges as well as a more or less standing army. Although the \\"Guerra de Palmares\\" consistently calls the king Ganga Zumba, and translates his name as \\"Great Lord\\" other documents, including a letter addressed to the king written in 1678 refer to him as \\"Ganazumba\\" (which is consistent with a Kimbundu term ngana meaning \\"lord\\"). One other official, Gana Zona also had this element in his name. Bust of Zumbi dos Palmares in Bras√≠lia. After a particularly devastating attack by the captain in 1676-7 that wounded Zumba and led to the capture of some of his children and grandchildren, Ganga Zumba sent a letter to the Governor of Pernambuco asking for peace. The governor responded by agreeing to pardon Gana Zumba and all his followers, on condition that they move to a position closer to the Portuguese settlements and return all enslaved Africans that had not been born in Palmares. Although Gana Zumba agreed to the terms, one of his more powerful leaders, Zumbi refused to accept the terms. According to a deposition made in 1692 by a Portuguese priest, Zumbi was born in Palmares in 1655, but was captured by Portuguese forces in a raid while still an infant. He was raised by the priest, and taught to read and write Portuguese and Latin. At the age of 15, however, Zumbi escaped and returned to Palmares. There he quickly won a reputation for military skill and bravery and was promoted to the leader of a large mocambo. In a short time, Zumbi had organized a rebellion against Ganga Zumba, who was styled as his uncle, and poisoned him (though this is not proven, and many believe Zumba poisoned himself as a warning not to trust the Portuguese). It is argued that Zumba was sick of fighting, but even more wary of signing the deal with the Portuguese, foreseeing their betrayal, and renewed war. By 1679 the Portuguese were again sending military expeditions against Zumbi. Meanwhile, the sugar planters reneged on the agreement and re-enslaved many of Gana Zumba's followers who had moved closer to the coast. From 1680 to 1694, the Portuguese and Zumbi, now the new king of Angola Janga, waged an almost constant war of greater or lesser violence. The Portuguese government finally brought in the famed Portuguese military commanders Domingos Jorge Velho and Bernardo Vieira de Melo, who had made their reputation fighting Indigenous peoples in Brazil peoples in S√£o Paulo and then in the S√£o Francisco valley. The final assault against Palmares occurred in January 1694. Cerca do Macaco, the main settlement, fell; and Zumbi was wounded. He eluded the Portuguese, but was betrayed, finally captured, and beheaded on November 20, 1695. Zumbi's brother continued the resistance, but Palmares was ultimately destroyed, and Velho and his followers were given land grants in the territory of Angola Janga, which they occupied as a means of keeping the kingdom from being reconstituted. Palmares had been destroyed by a large army of Indians under the command of white and caboclo (white/Indian mixed-bloods) captains-of-war.Jo√£o Jos√© Reis & Fl√°vio dos Santos Gomes, \\"Quilombo: Brazilian Maroons during slavery\\" , January 31, 2002, Cultural Survival Quarterly, Issue 25.4. Although the kingdom was destroyed the Palmares region continued to host many smaller runaway settlements, and so the Portuguese still had the problems they had before, but there was no longer the centralized state in the mountains.

Although it is often argued that the inhabitants of Palmares defended themselves using the martial art form called capoeira, there is no documentary evidence that the residents of Palmares actually used this method of fighting, which historian Thomas Desh-Obi has connected with the Benguela Highlands region of Angola. Most accounts describe them as armed with spears, bows, arrows and guns. They were able to acquire guns by trading with the Portuguese and by allowing small-holding cattle raisers to use their land.  In movies  A semi-fictional account of Palmares was made into the 1984 Brazilian film by Carlos Diegues, Quilombo.

The form appears very early in medieval art; for example in a metalwork treasure binding given to Monza Cathedral by Queen Theodelinda (d. 628), and the 8th century lower cover of the Lindau Gospels in the Morgan Library. An early English example from the start of the age of heraldry proper (i.e. about 1200) is found in the arms of Baron Berkeley. Etymology The word patt√©e is a French adjective in the feminine form used in its full context as la croix patt√©e, meaning literally \\"footed cross\\", from the noun patte, meaning foot, generally that of an animal.Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise Lexis, Paris, 1993, p.1356 The cross has 4 splayed feet, each akin to the foot, for example, of a chalice or candelabrum. In German it is called Tatzenkreuz from Tatze, foot, paw. Planch√© provides a dubious suggestion that the term comes from the Latin verb pateo, to lie open, be spread. He states it to be discernible on the standard of King Stephen (1135‚Äì1154).Planch√©, J.R. The Pursuivant of Arms; or Heraldry Founded upon Facts. London, 1859, p.29 Variants Several variants exist as follows: File:Cross-Pattee- Heraldry.svgWith the edges of the arms concave throughout; the \\"Iron Cross\\", as generally used on Luftstreitkr√§fte aircraft in 1915 File:CrossPatt√©eFitch√©e.svgA cross patt√©e with a sharp point added to the lower limb, as if for use in staking into the ground.

File:Cross-Pattee- alternate.svgWith straight parallel lines at the centre (considered patt√©e by Rudolf Koch in Book of Signs) Use in crowns Many crowns worn by monarchs have jewelled crosses patt√©es mounted atop the band. Most crowns possess at least four such crosses, from which the half arches rise. Some crowns are designed so that the half-arches can be detached, allowing the circlet to be worn separately on occasion. A cross patt√©e is particularly associated with crowns in Christian countries. It is often heavily jewelled, with diamonds and precious stones. The Koh-i-Noor diamond is set in a cross patt√©e on the Crown of Queen Elizabeth. The British Imperial State Crown has a base of four crosses patt√©e alternating with four fleurs-de-lis. A cross patt√©e on the Imperial State Crown holds the Black Prince's Ruby. The cross patt√©e also features in many of the other British Crowns including the St Edward's Crown, used for coronations, and the Imperial Crown of India created for George V as Emperor of India to wear at the Delhi Durbar of 1911. Use by Crusaders, Prussia and Germany =Teutonic Knights= German Iron Cross, World War I Modern Bundeswehr emblem This cross is often associated with the Crusades. The heraldic cross patt√©e was sometimes used by the Teutonic Knights, a Crusader order, though their more usual emblem was a plain straight black cross on white,. =Iron Cross= In 1813, King Frederick William III of Prussia established the Iron Cross as a decoration for military valor, and it remained in use, in various forms, by Prussia and later Germany until 1945. A stylized version of the Iron Cross is used to date by the German army (Bundeswehr) as its symbol of nationality, and is found on vehicles, aircraft and publications. Prussian and Imperial German Landwehr and Landsturm troops used a Cross Patt√©e cap badge to distinguish them from regular army troops. A stylized version of the Cross Patt√©e is used by the modern German military (Bundeswehr) as its symbol of nationality, and is found on vehicles, aircraft and publications, with no border of any kind at the ends of each arm (as was the case with the Balkenkreuz used on German aircraft in 1918-1945).

As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party he represented Galway city as its Member of Parliament from 1906 to 1918. He served as a British Army officer in France during World War I and was a prominent proponent of Irish involvement in the Allied war effort.Kate Newmann, \\"Stephen Lucius Gwynn\\", Dictionary of Ulster Biography He founded the Irish Centre Party in 1919, but his moderate nationalism was eclipsed by the growing popularity of Sinn F√©in. Family background Stephen Gwynn was born in Saint Columba's College in Rathfarnham, south County Dublin, where his father John Gwynn (1827‚Äì1917), a biblical scholar and Church of Ireland clergyman, was warden. His mother Lucy Josephine (1840‚Äì1907) was the daughter of the Irish nationalist William Smith O'Brien. Stephen was the eldest of ten children (eight brothers and two sisters). Shortly after his birth the family moved to Ramelton in County Donegal to the parish where his father had been appointed parson; he later became Regius Professor of Divinity at Trinity College, Dublin. Early years Stephen Gwynn spent his early childhood in rural County Donegal, which was to shape his later view of Ireland. He went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where, as scholar, in 1884 he was awarded first-class honours in classical moderations and in 1886 literae humaniores. During term holidays he returned to Dublin, where he met several of the political and literary figures of the day. Professional life After graduating Gwynn spent ten years from 1886 tutoring as a schoolmaster, for a time in France, which created a lifelong interest in French culture, as expressed in his Praise of France (1927). By 1896 he had developed an interest in writing, becoming a writer and journalist in London focused on English themes, until he came into contact with the emerging Irish literary revival, when he served as secretary of the Irish Literary Society. This was the beginning of a long and prolific career as a writer covering a wide range of literary genres, from poetry and biographical subjects to general historical works. The eighteenth century was his particular specialism. He wrote numerous books on travel and on the topography of his own homeland, as well as on his other interests: wine, eighteenth- century painting and fishing. Gwynn returned to Ireland in 1904 when he entered politics. In a by-election in November 1906 he won a seat for Galway Borough, which he represented as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party until 1918. During this period he was active in the Gaelic League and was one of the few Irish MPs to have close links to the Irish literary revival. Along with Joseph Maunsel Hone and George Roberts he founded the Dublin publishing house of Maunsel and Company. He was opposed to the demand for Irish as a compulsory subject for matriculation. He supported the campaign which won the establishment of a Catholic university when he served on the Irish University Royal Commission in 1908. During the debate on the third Home Rule Bill, Gwynn at the request of his party leader John Redmond wrote The case for Home Rule (1911) and was in charge of much of the party's official publicity and its replies to criticism from Sinn F√©in. Great War On the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 Gwynn strongly supported Redmond's encouragement of Irish nationalists and the Irish National Volunteers to support the Allied and British war effort by enlisting in Irish regiments of the Irish Divisions, especially as a means to ensure the implementation of the suspended Home Rule Act at the end of an expectedly short war. Gwynn, now over fifty, enlisted in January 1915 with the 7th Leinster Regiment in the 16th (Irish) Division. In July he was commissioned as a captain in the 6th (Service) Battalion, Connaught Rangers and served with them on the Western Front at Messines, the Somme and elsewhere. He was one of five Irish Nationalist MPs who enlisted and served in the army, the others being J. L. Esmonde, Willie Redmond, William Redmond and D. D. Sheehan, as well as former MP Tom Kettle. Together with Kettle and William Redmond he undertook a recruitment drive for the Irish divisions, co-operating with Kettle on a collection of ballads called Battle songs for the Irish Brigade (1915). Gwynn was made a chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur in July 1915. In 1916 he was appointed to the Dardanelles Commission. Recalled to Ireland in late 1917 to participate in the Irish Convention chaired by Sir Horace Plunkett, he sided with the Redmondite faction of the Irish Party in supporting a compromise with the southern unionists in an attempt to reach consensus on a Home Rule settlement which would avoid partition. On the death of Redmond in March 1918, Gwynn took over as leader of the moderate nationalists in the Convention. He opposed the threat of compulsory military service during the Conscription Crisis of 1918, though as a member of the Irish Recruiting Council he continued to support voluntary recruitment, encountering intense opposition led by Sinn F√©in. Latter years Stephen Gwynn formed the Irish Centre Party in 1919 and stood unsuccessfully as an Independent Nationalist for Dublin University in the December general elections. The party merged with Plunkett's Irish Dominion League to press for a settlement by consent on the basis of dominion status, but Gwynn subsequently broke with Plunkett due to his willingness to accept partition as a temporary compromise. The polarities which divided Ireland during the Anglo-Irish War and Irish Civil War increasingly sidelined Gwynn's brand of moderate cultural nationalism. Although he supported the newly emergent nation he equally condemned some of the excesses, such as the burning of houses belonging to Free State senators. Gwynn‚Äôs personal life also became complicated at this stage and around 1920, he had a romantic association with married artist Grace Henry who was perhaps the best known female artist in Ireland at the time. During this period Gwynn and Grace went travelling in France and Italy and at various stages in his life Henry painted portraits of Gwynn including a very distinguished looking Gwynn in his late 60‚Äôs or early 70‚Äôs. Their relationship contributed significantly to the separation of Henry from her artist husband Paul Henry In 1930. During this 20‚Äôs decade Gwynn also devoted himself to writing, covering political events as Irish correspondent to The Observer and The Times. Later in his career he wrote some substantial works, and together with his son Denis Gwynn (The Life of John Redmond, 1932) did much to shape the retrospective image and self-justification of John Redmond. Stephen Gwynn was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by the National University of Ireland in 1940, and a Litt.D. by the University of Dublin in 1945. The Irish Academy of Letters awarded him the Gregory Medal in April 1950. In his literary writings he stood for a humanism and tolerance, which qualities, due to political upheavals, were relatively rare in the Ireland of his day. He died on 11 June 1950 at his home in Terenure, Dublin and was buried at Tallaght cemetery, south County Dublin. Family Stephen Gwynn married his cousin Mary Louisa (d. 1941), daughter of Revd. James Gwynn. She later converted to Catholicism. They had three sons and two daughters who were brought up in her religion, of whom Aubrey (1892‚Äì1983) became a Jesuit priest and professor of medieval history at University College, Dublin. Their second son Denis Rolleston (1893‚Äì1971) was professor of modern Irish history at University College, Cork. Stephen Gwynn's brother Edward John (1868‚Äì1941) became provost of Trinity College and another brother Robin (Robert Malcolm) became its senior dean. His sister Lucy Gwynn was the first woman registrar of Trinity. A third brother, Charles, had a successful career in the British Army and retired as a Major General. Younger brothers Lucius and Jack were noted cricketers.

It is down the line from London Charing Cross. The station is operated by Southeastern but is also served by trains operated by Southern.  History  The station building and house, still in existence today, were constructed in 1851 by the South Eastern Railway (SER). The competing London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) trains were not allowed to stop here until December 1870. The two companies maintained separate booking offices until 1923 when they both became part of the Southern Railway. The station is constructed in a narrow valley with higher ground east and west, so that trains arrive and depart either end of the platform through tunnels. This restricts the number of carriages which have direct access to the platform to 8 cars.  Services  Services at St Leonards Warrior Square are operated by Southern using Class 171 DMUs and Class 377 EMUs and by Southeastern using Class 375 EMUs.

Crimped grain brings health benefits to the animals and economic benefits such as cost savings and increased meat or milk production to the farmer.  History  Crimping was developed in Finland in the end of the 1960s by two farmer brothers, Aimo and Gunnar Korte, based on findings of British researchers as early as 1918. The brothers made the first crimper machine for home farm use, and as the word started to spread, they set up a company to manufacture and sell the machines. The British researchers had established, that grain attains its peak nutritional value when the moisture content of the grain is between 35% and 45%. However, it took about 50 years before this knowledge was successfully turned into a method to process and preserve the grain when still moist.  Description  Traditionally, grain is not harvested until it is dry enough to be ground by a hammer mill. Moist grain often cannot be ground or stored without machine drying and using preservatives, which always increases costs. In crimping, the grain is combined moist and run through the crimper machine, which will break and flatten the grains. Additives, such as certain preservatives or molasses and water (if necessary) can be added in order to ensure the protection of nutrients. Crimped grain is stored in storage silos as a silage. Crimped grain is dustless, thus convenient to handle, does not require any further processing, and is often preferred by the animals to drier and dustier feeds. Practical experiments by farming and livestock research institutions in Finland, Sweden, UK and elsewhere have confirmed, that crimped feed has higher nutritional values, it increases the animals' growth and milk production, improves milk quality and the animals' health, and in addition, helps cut costs. An important point is that crimping home-grown grain and processing the feed on the spot at the farm, the feed ingredients can be controlled and are fully traceable, thus helping in prevention of diseases, such as BSE.

Some aspects of Shamanism, Buddhism, and Neo-Confucianism were integrated into Korean philosophy. Traditional Korean thought has been influenced by a number of religious and philosophical thought-systems over the years. As the main influences on life in Korea, often Korean Shamanism, Korean Taoism, Korean Buddhism, Korean Confucianism and Silhak movements have shaped Korean life and thought. From 20th century, various Western philosohpical thoughts have strongly influenced on Korean academia, politics, and daily life. Buddhism Haeinsa is a Buddhist temple in South Gyeongsang. Korean Buddhist thinkers refined ideas originally introduced from China into a distinct form. The Three Kingdoms of Korea introduced Buddhism to Japan, from where it was popularized in the West. Korean Buddhism consists mostly of the Seon lineage, which is derivative of the Chen (Zen) Buddhism of China and precursor to Zen Buddhism known in the West through Japan. Buddhist temples can be found in most parts of Korea and many are considered national treasures. Confucianism One of the most substantial influences in Korean intellectual history was the introduction of Confucian thought as part of the cultural exchange from China. Today the legacy of Confucianism remains a fundamental part of Korean society, shaping the moral system, the way of life, social relations between old and young, and high culture, and even survived the modernization of the legal system. Schools of thought in the Joseon period This dynasty arose out of the military dictatorships and chaos of the preceding era. Transition in this era was from Buddhism to a soldierly approach to Neo-Confucianism. Much work was done, especially on commentaries, and the Chu Hsi school represented indeed the golden age of Korean religious philosophy. Metaphysical research at this time investigated the theological relations between principle (i) and material/vital force (ki), and between as well the four beginnings (sadan), and the seven feelings (ch'ilchong); with the division of the Joseon Confucianists into two leading schools: one on \\"force\\" and one on \\"principles\\". The philosopher Hwadam ( Suh Kyungduk, 1489‚Äì1546 ) moved to integrate i and ki and spoke of Great Harmony (taehwa). In the Four‚ÄìSeven Debate with Ki Daesung, Toegye ( Yi Hwang, 1501 ‚Äì 70 ), while being still dualistic, broke away from Chu Hsi by espousing the reciprocal emanation (hobal) of i and ki: with the Four, ki follows i when i becomes emanant; with the Seven, when ki becomes emanant, i ‚Äòrides‚Äô ki. Though he was critical of Toegye's idea that ki follows i as being dualistic, Yulgok (Yi I, 1536 ‚Äì 84 ) nevertheless embraced his notion that i ‚Äòrides‚Äô ki: only ki is emanant and i moves its emanation; i and ki are ‚Äòneither two things nor one thing‚Äô, as evidenced by ‚Äòwondrous fusion‚Äô (myohap). For Yulgok, original nature (i) and physical nature (ki) coalesce into one human nature. Toegye and Yulgok, whose thoughts culminated in an irenic fusionism, constituted the crowning phase of East Asian neo-Confucianism by exhibiting dialectical dexterity in articulating the concepts of i and ki, left unclarified by the Chinese. Toegye also developed the neo-Confucianist concept of single-mindedness (kyung), which was a manifestation of his unequivocal humanism, as shown by his total rejection of the Mandate of Heaven (chunmyung), which still had a hold on the Chinese, including Chu Hsi. Toegye's kyung synthesized the primeval Korean sense of supreme-efforts-come-earnest-devotion (chisung) with the Confucianist notion of holding fast to mind (jik-yung); he advocated self-efforts for creating a meaningful life. In particular, his concept of single-mindedness had a lasting influence on the Japanese neo-Confucianists of the Tokugawa period. Every major Korean neo-Confucianist shared Toegye's preoccupation with single-mindedness, which signalled new stress on praxis in the development of Korean neo-Confucianism: the fusion of the metaphysical and the physical is better brought about through action than speculation, important as theory might be. That was the point of Yulgok's integration of sincerity (sung) with single-mindedness. In this respect Korean neo-Confucianism made a break with the Cheng-Chu school of Chinese neo-Confucianism, which was overly speculative. During the later Joseon period, Silhak, a form of Neo- Confucianism, emerged. One of the most prominent Silhak philosophers was Jeong Yakyong. Western philosophy in Korea, 1890‚Äì1945 Those who were sent to be educated in Japan, returned with limited knowledge of Western philosophy as a whole, although the German educational influence in Japan led to the beginning of interest in German idealists in Korea through indirect knowledge, with the exception of Marx, Hegel, and the dialecticians. The strong influence of low church Christianity, through missionary schools, led to practical American YMCA-style philosophy entering into Korea from the 1890s onwards. The discussion of Korean Christianity and Korean Christian philosophy is complicated with many divisions, and discussed in articles elsewhere. Philosophy in Korea was divided, by Western school, according to a kind of pragmatic mix of varied progressive libertarian beliefs in the south with highly variable changes from rigid authoritianism to softer and easier more pragmatic approaches from the 1990s onwards. North Korean post-1945 philosophy In the republican period, post-1945, Marxism‚ÄìLeninism in the north was built on the Confucian yangban scholar-warriors of earlier times, if perhaps taken to absolutist extremes. The main influence in North Korea has been since 1996, the notion of \\"The Red Banner Spirit\\". This system of belief encourages the North Korean people to build a \\"kangsong taeguk\\", a fortress state, based on self-reliance and absolute loyalty to the leader (suryong). This philosophy was created by the \\"three generals of Mt. Paektu,\\" referring to former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, his father Kim Il-sung and his natural mother Kim Jong-suk. Again little is known of philosophical publications on this subject; but it appears to have replaced Marxism with a home-grown nationalistic ideology.

The few productivity releases from game developer and publisher Electronic Arts include this and Financial Cookbook. In the UK it was distributed by Ariolasoft. Originally sold for , Cut & Paste was praised for its user-friendliness and criticized as overly simplistic. Magazine advertisements proclaim, \\"If you can learn to use this word processor in 90 seconds, can it really be any good?\\" and the slogan on the box reads \\"The Remarkably Simple Word Processor\\". Overview Cut & Paste is a simple word processor released by Electronic Arts in 1984 for . It was developed in a time when the ability to cut, copy, and paste text (now known as a clipboard) was a significant feature for home computers. Its package is a hard plastic box which opens like a book, containing a program floppy disk, a data floppy disk with sample documents, and a 27-page manual including the operation of all of the four supported computers. The application launches with onscreen instructions. Ongoing usage has a fullscreen text editor with a one-row menu bar along the bottom. The menu bar is accessed using the \`esc\` key, and is navigated with the arrow keys and \`return\` key. The application operates in insert mode, so existing characters are edited only by deleting instead of typing directly over them. \`Backspace\` from the right is used instead of \`delete\` from the left. The application can help prevent the orphaning of a paragraph's line across a page break. There is a full-screen print menu. The application's namesake feature allows the user to begin a selection, use the arrow keys to mark the full selection, and end a selectionthen cut it and paste it. The clipboard buffer persists between different documents. Features absent from Cut & Paste which were sooner or later considered staples of 1980s word processing include saving the page headers, right margin justification, centering, underlining, selecting fonts, utilizing any printer features, text searching, spelling checking, and paragraph lead indentation. It uses a proprietary file format which can't be interchanged with any other software. Development Cut & Paste was developed by Steve Hayes, Tim Mott, Jerry Morrison, Dan Silva, Steve Shaw, David S. Maynard, and Norm Lane. David Maynard had previously created Worms?, a software toy that was one of the 1983 launch games from Electronic Arts. Dan Silva went on to write Deluxe Paint for the Amiga, published in 1985. Reception Marty Petersen, for InfoWorld, wrote \\"We think it is simply mediocre, performing just adequately, and not nearly as good a buy as some other low-cost word processing programs.\\" He called out the limited text formatting capabilities as a significant drawback, and concluded that Cut & Paste is \\"little more than a glorified typewriter\\". Reviewing the Atari 8-bit version for UK magazine Page 6 in 1986, John Davison concluded, \\"I find it difficult to raise any enthusiasm for this program. Its few good points are far outweighed by its many bad ones. In action, it seems closer to an electronic typewriter than a computerised word processor.\\" BYTE said that Cut & Paste \\"is simple to use but unfortunately it's much too limited to be of great value as a serious word processor\\", recommending it for children learning how to use a computer. Arthur Leyenberger in an August 1984 review for ANALOG Computing wrote, \\"The user interface is probably Cut & Paste's strongest feature. ... I was able to start typing this review using the program as soon as I put the disk in the drive.\\" But he found the software \\"just does not have enough features to make it a serious choice for anyone doing more than writing an occasional letter.\\" References 1983 software Apple II software Commodore 64 software Atari 8-bit family software Electronic Arts Word processors ","title":"Cut &amp; Paste (word processor)"},{"id":"1769100","text":"Saint Hermann Joseph, O.Praem., (ca. 11507 April 1241) was a German Premonstratensian canon regular and mystic. Never formally canonized, in 1958 his status as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church was formally recognized by Pope Pius XII. Life He was born in Cologne. According to the biography by Razo Bonvisinus, a contemporary and prior of Steinfeld Abbey (Acta Sanctorum, 7 April, I, 679), Hermann was the son of noble but poor parents. At the age of seven he attended school and very early he was known for devotion to the Blessed Virgin. At every available moment he could be found at the church of St. Mary on the Capitol, where he would kneel rapt in prayer to Mary. Bonvisinus claims that the boy once presented an apple, saved from his own lunch, to a statue of Jesus, who accepted it. According to still another legend, on another occasion, when on a cold day he made his appearance with bare feet, Mary procured him the means of getting shoes. At the age of twelve he entered the abbey of the Premonstratensian (more commonly known as Norbertine) Canons Regular at Steinfeld. As he was too young to be accepted into the Order, he was sent to make his studies in the Netherlands. Upon his return, he made his vows and was given the habit. As a novice, he was entrusted initially with the service of the refectory and later of the sacristy. After his ordination, Hermann was sometimes sent out to perform pastoral duties and was also in frequent demand for the making and repairing of clocks. Late in his life, he had under his charge the spiritual welfare of the Cistercian nuns at , near Z√ºlpich, whom he served as chaplain. There he died and was buried in their cloister. His body was later transferred back to Steinfeld, where his marble tomb and large picture may be seen to the present day; portions of his relics are at Cologne and at Antwerp. He is represented in art as kneeling before a statue of the Virgin and Child and offering an apple. The process of his canonization was begun in 1626, at the request of Archbishop Ferdinand of Cologne and the Emperor Ferdinand II, but was interrupted. His feast, however, continued to be celebrated on 4 April, by the members of his Order and the name of Blessed Hermann was listed in the Premonstratensian supplement to the Roman Martyrology. They also celebrate the translation of his relics on 24 May. His status as a saint was confirmed by Pope Pius XII in 1958. (The Salvatorian Fathers, who had come to occupy the abbey in Steinfeld in modern times, opted to perform this less costly and involved process‚Äîknown as Confirmatio Cultus‚Äîrather than to carry out a full canonization process.) His current feast day on the calendar of the diocese of Cologne is 21 May. Works His works are: \\"A Commentary on the Canticle of Canticles\\", which is lost; \\"Opuscula\\" (new edition, Namur, 1899), including: \\"Duodecim gratiarum actiones\\"; \\"Jubilus seu Hymnus de SS. undecim millibus Virginibus\\"; \\"Oratio ad Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum\\", taken to a great extent from the Canticle of Canticles; \\"Alia Oratio\\"; \\"Precula de quinque Gaudiis B. Mariae V.\\" It is not quite certain whether the last three are the works of Hermann, though they are generally ascribed to him. References *Timmermans, Vie du b.

Although CD56 is often considered a marker of neural lineage commitment due to its discovery site, CD56 expression is also found in, among others, the hematopoietic system. Here, the expression of CD56 is most stringently associated with, but certainly not limited to, natural killer cells. CD56 has been detected on other lymphoid cells, including gamma delta (Œ≥Œ¥) Œ§ cells and activated CD8+ T cells, as well as on dendritic cells. NCAM has been implicated as having a role in cell‚Äìcell adhesion,Pathology Outlines neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. Forms, domains and homophilic binding  NCAM is a glycoprotein of Immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. At least 27 alternatively spliced NCAM mRNAs are produced, giving a wide diversity of NCAM isoforms. The three main isoforms of NCAM vary only in their cytoplasmic domain: * NCAM-120kDa (GPI anchored) * NCAM-140kDa (short cytoplasmic domain) * NCAM-180kDa (long cytoplasmic domain) The extracellular domain of NCAM consists of five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains followed by two fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains. The different domains of NCAM have been shown to have different roles, with the Ig domains being involved in homophilic binding to NCAM, and the FNIII domains being involved signalling leading to neurite outgrowth. Homophilic binding occurs between NCAM molecules on opposing surfaces (trans-) and NCAM molecules on the same surface (cis-)1. There is much controversy as to how exactly NCAM homophilic binding is arranged both in trans- and cis-. Current models suggest trans- homophilic binding occurs between two NCAM molecules binding antiparallel between all five Ig domains or just IgI and IgII. cis- homophilic binding is thought to occur by interactions between both IgI and IgII, and IgI and IgIII, forming a higher order NCAM multimer. Both cis- and trans- NCAM homophilic binding have been shown to be important in NCAM ‚Äúactivation‚Äù leading to neurite outgrowth.  Minor exons  Another layer of complexity is created by the insertion of other \\"minor\\" exons in the NCAM transcript. The two most notable are: * the VASE (VAriable domain Spliced Exon) exon which is thought to correlate with an inhibition of the neurite outgrowth promoting properties of NCAM. * the MSD (Muscle Specific Domain), which is thought to play a positive role in myoblast fusion. In skeletal muscle it is found in all three NCAM isoforms, increasing their MW, giving NCAM-125, NCAM-145, and NCAM-185 isoforms, but is most commonly found in the NCAM-125 isoform.  Posttranslational modification  NCAM exhibits glycoforms as it can be posttranslationally modified by the addition of polysialic acid (PSA) to the fifth Ig domain, which is thought to abrogate its homophilic binding properties and can lead to reduced cell adhesion important in cell migration and invasion. PSA has been shown to be critical in learning and memory. Removal of PSA from NCAM by the enzyme endoneuraminidase (EndoN) has been shown to abolish long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).  Expression in normal cells  The neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM1 appears on early embryonic cells and is important in the formation of cell collectives and their boundaries at sites of morphogenesis. Later in development, NCAM1 (CD56) expression is found on various differentiated tissues and is a major CAM mediating adhesion among neurons and between neurons and muscle.  Function  NCAM is thought to signal to induce neurite outgrowth via the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and act upon the p59Fyn signaling pathway. In nerves, NCAM1 regulates homophilic (like-like) interactions between neurons and between neurons and muscle; it associates with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and stimulates tyrosine kinase activity of receptor to induce neurite outgrowth. When neural crest cells stop making N-CAM and N-cadherin, and start displaying integrin receptors, cells separate and migrate. During hematopoiesis, CD56 is the prototypic marker of NK cells, also present on subset of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. In cell adhesion, CD56 contributes to cell-cell adhesion or cell-matrix adhesion during embryonic development.  Pathology  In anatomic pathology, pathologists make use of CD56 immunohistochemistry to recognize certain tumors. * Normal cells that stain positively for CD56 include NK cells, activated T cells, the brain and cerebellum, and neuroendocrine tissues. * Tumors that are CD56-positive are myeloma, myeloid leukemia, neuroendocrine tumors, Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, small cell lung carcinoma, and the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors.  Cancer  A member of the NCAM superfamily, NCAM2 gene has been observed progressively downregulated in Human papillomavirus-positive neoplastic keratinocytes derived from uterine cervical preneoplastic lesions at different levels of malignancy. For this reason, NCAM2 is likely to be associated with tumorigenesis and may be a potential prognostic marker for uterine cervical preneoplastic lesions progression.  Alzheimer's disease  NCAM2 is found in lower levels in hippocampal synapses of Alzheimer's disease sufferers and is found to be broken down by beta-amyloid  Anti-NCAM therapy  NCAM has been used as a target molecule for experimental antibody-based immunotherapy. Successful radio-immunolocalisation of metastases was demonstrated after giving injections of NCAM-binding 123J-UJ13a or 131J-UJ13a radio- immunoconjugates to children with neuroblastoma. Patients with small cell lung cancer were treated with the anti-NCAM immunotoxine huN901-DM1 in two different clinical studies, revealing acceptable toxicity and signs of clinical response.

For information about the actual Commando unit, see Z Special Unit. Attack Force Z (alternatively titled The Z Men) is a 1982 Australian-TaiwaneseLee, Daw-Ming Historical Dictionary of Taiwan Cinema Scarecrow Press, 8 November 2012, pp. xxxix-xxxx World War II film directed by Tim Burstall. It is loosely based on actual events and was filmed in Taiwan in 1979. It was screened at the Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 1981. The film is noted for starring Mel Gibson and Sam Neill, who were relatively unknown in the US at the time but who went on to become international stars. The plot concerns Captain P.G. Kelly (Gibson), who leads a team from the elite Z Special Unit against the Empire of Japan during the Second World War. The film fictionalises the exploits of the Z Special Unit, which was also known as Z Force. It was a joint Australian, British and New Zealand commando unit. Its main brief was to conduct reconnaissance and sabotage missions throughout Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia. Plot In the Straits of Sembaleng, five men are dispatched by submarine in Klepper canoes to rescue survivors of a shot-down plane on a nearby island which is occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. Led by Paul Kelly (Gibson), an inexperienced commando officer, the team secretly lands on the island and hides their kayaks. As they venture in land, Ted 'Kingo' King is hit by fire from an unseen machine gun post, the team quickly eliminates the Japanese defenders and return to their wounded comrade. King has been hit on the leg, the bullet smashing his kneecap. King cannot be allowed to fall into enemy hands and compromise the mission under interrogation, and after sharing a cigarette with him, Costello shoots him. The four remaining men return to their search; coming across a rice farmer, they learn of the area in which the plane crashed. The rice farmer is also killed in order to preserve secrecy. But as they near their destination they spot a Japanese squad at a local house, after the Japanese leave they enter the house and meet the local resistance leader Lin, his grown up daughter Chien Hua and her younger brothers and sisters. With a guide to lead them, they head off to the plane but are attacked by Japanese soldiers at a Buddhist temple. Separated from the rest, interpreter Jan Veitch ends up returning to Lin's house where Chien Hua hides him from the returning Japanese. After the deaths of their soldiers, the Japanese officers Watanabe and Imanaka torture Chien to tell them the location of her father, who they believe is hiding the survivors of the crashed plane, but Chien Hua refuses. Lin's son Shaw Hu falsely tells the Japanese that Lin, the Z men, and the plane's survivors are heading for the island's capital. All the Japanese leave except for two soldiers guarding Chien Hua; Veitch kills both with help of Shaw Hu. Meanwhile, within sight of the plane, Kelly watches as locals blow up the wreckage. Lin is evasive, and after quizzing the inhabitants of a village, the team head on to the plane. Kelly manages to get Lin to tell them that the two survivors are being taken to his home, so they turn around and head back. In the capital, Veitch is led to the survivors. One of them is a defecting Japanese government official Imoguchi, and he is believed to hold a secret that could end the war faster. Only Kelly knows that he must be rescued at any cost - or killed. As the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall together, Kelly must persuade his own men that Imoguchi is worth rescuing and the local resistance that it is worth fighting against their Japanese enemies.

It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and . Its three-letter station code is WLC and it is in Travelcard zone 7. The station and all trains serving it are operated by Greater Anglia. The station has 4 Oyster card readers rather than ticket barriers. During the 2012 Olympic Games, Waltham Cross and Cheshunt provided the main rail access to the Lee Valley White Water Centre. History =Early years (1840-1862)= The first station, together with the railway line from Stratford to Broxbourne, was opened by the Northern & Eastern Railway (N&ER;) on 15 September 1840. Originally called Waltham and later renamed to Waltham Cross, it was originally on a site to the north of the road between Waltham Cross and Waltham Abbey. Following on from negotiations in 1843, the Eastern Counties Railway took over operation of the N&ER; from 1 January 1844 paying rent and dividing the profits. By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway was formed by amalgamation. Thus Cheshunt became a GER station in 1862. =Great Eastern Railway (1862-1922)= A signal box was provided in 1881 on the up side just north of the road bridge. Many years later when the road was widened the box was actually located under the bridge itself. In 1885 the station was relocated to the current site south of the road bridge. A subsequent renaming to Waltham Cross and Abbey was later rescinded. In 1911 the Waltham Abbey and Cheshunt Gas & Coke Co had two sidings on the down side north of the station. A three siding goods yard was located on the up side of the line. =London & North Eastern Railway (1923-1947)= On 1 January 1923 the GER became part of the London & North Eastern Railway. During Wprld War 2 the yards were busy with traffic from the Lea Valley armaments industry. =British Railways (1948-1994)= The nationalisation of Britain's railways saw the operation of Waltham Cross station pass to British Railways Eastern Region. From 1958 local passenger services between Cheshunt and London via Tottenham Hale were normally operated by Class 125 diesel multiple units. As late as the early 1960s the goods yards located north of the station were busy in traffic but these were closed in the 1960s in preparation of the electrification of the Lea Valley line. The mechanical signal box was closed on 13 January 1969 with its duties being taken over by a panel at Brimsdown. The lines through Waltham Cross were electrified on 5 May 1969.White, H.P., A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain Volume 3 Greater London, David & Charles, 1987 =The Privatisation area (1994-current)= In 2011, a major redevelopment was carried out at the station in preparation for the London 2012 Olympics. From 2 January 2013, Oyster cards are accepted at the station. The station is in Travelcard zone 7.The station building prior to the 2011 redevelopment. Service The typical off-peak service between Monday-Saturday is two trains per hour to London Liverpool Street via Tottenham Hale, two trains per hour to Hertford East, one train per hour to Stratford, and one train per hour to Bishops Stortford.

Crean was a member of three major expeditions to Antarctica during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott's 1911‚Äì13 Terra Nova Expedition. This saw the race to reach the South Pole lost to Roald Amundsen and ended in the deaths of Scott and his party. During the expedition, Crean's solo walk across the Ross Ice Shelf to save the life of Edward Evans led to him receiving the Albert Medal. Crean left the family farm near Annascaul to enlist in the Royal Navy at age 15 but lied about his own age, as he had to be 16. In 1901, while serving on Ringarooma in New Zealand, he volunteered to join Scott's 1901‚Äì04 Discovery Expedition to Antarctica, thus beginning his exploring career. After his experience on the Terra Nova, Crean's third and final Antarctic venture was as second officer on Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. After the ship Endurance became beset in the pack ice and sank, Crean and the ship's company spent 492 days drifting on the ice before undertaking a journey in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant Island. He was a member of the crew which made a small-boat journey of from Elephant Island to South Georgia Island to seek aid for the stranded party. Early life and career Thomas Crean was born in 1877 in the farming area of Gurtuchrane near the village of Annascaul on Corca Dhuibhne in County Kerry, Ireland, to Patrick and Catherine (n√©e Courtney) Crean. One of ten siblings, he attended the local Catholic school (at nearby Brackluin), leaving at the age of 12 to help on the family farm.Smith, p. 16 At the age of 15, he enlisted in the Royal Navy at the naval station in nearby Minard Inlet, possibly after an argument with his father.Smith, p. 18 His enlistment as a boy second class is recorded in Royal Navy records on 10 July 1893, ten days before his 16th birthday, albeit without his parents' consent.Smith, p. 19 Crean's initial naval apprenticeship was aboard the training ship Impregnable at Devonport. In November 1894, he was transferred to Devastation. By his 18th birthday, in 1895, Crean was serving in Royal Arthur, and rated ordinary seaman. Less than a year later, he was in Wild Swan as an able seaman, and later joined the Navy's torpedo school ship, Defiance. By 1899, Crean had advanced to the rate of petty officer, second class and was serving in Vivid.Smith, pp. 20‚Äì21 In February 1900, Crean was posted to the torpedo vessel Ringarooma, which was part of the Royal Navy's New Zealand Squadron based in the South Island. On 18 December 1901, he was demoted from petty officer to able seaman for an unspecified misdemeanour.Smith, p. 29 In December 1901, the Ringarooma was ordered to assist Robert Falcon Scott's ship Discovery when it was docked at Lyttelton Harbour awaiting to departure to Antarctica. When an able seaman of Scott's ship deserted after striking a petty officer, a replacement was required; Crean volunteered, and was accepted.Smith, p. 31 Discovery Expedition, 1901‚Äì1904 Aerial view of Hut Point, McMurdo Sound, Antarctica ‚Äî the location of Discoverys base, in 1902‚Äì04 Discovery sailed to the Antarctic on 21 December 1901, and seven weeks later, on 8 February 1902, arrived in McMurdo Sound, where she anchored at a spot which was later designated \\"Hut Point\\".The name \\"Hut Point\\" was given to mark the location, alongside the ship's anchorage, of the expedition's main storage hut, which was used in later expeditions as a shelter and storage depot. Crane, p. 157 Here the men established the base from which they would launch scientific and exploratory sledging journeys. Crean proved to be one of the most efficient man-haulers in the party; over the expedition as a whole, only seven of the 48-member party logged more time in harness than Crean's 149 days.Smith, pp. 46‚Äì47 Crean had a good sense of humour and was well liked by his companions. Scott's second-in-command, Albert Armitage, wrote in his book Two Years in the Antarctic that \\"Crean was an Irishman with a fund of wit and an even temper which nothing disturbed.\\"Smith, p. 46 Crean accompanied Lieutenant Michael Barne on three sledging trips across the Ross Ice Shelf, then known as the \\"Great Ice Barrier\\". These included the 12-man party led by Barne which set out on 30 October 1902 to lay depots in support of the main southern journey undertaken by Scott, Shackleton and Edward Wilson. On 11 November the Barne party passed the previous furthest south mark,Smith, p. 55 set by Carsten Borchgrevink in 1900 at 78¬∞50'S, a record which they held briefly until the southern party itself passed it on its way to an eventual 82¬∞17'S.Crane, pp. 214‚Äì15. Modern re-calculations based on photographs have placed this furthest south at 82¬∞11'S (Crane map, p. 215). During the Antarctic winter of 1902 Discovery became locked in the ice. Efforts to free her during the summer of 1902‚Äì03 failed, and although some of the expedition's members (including Ernest Shackleton) left in a relief ship, Crean and the majority of the party remained in the Antarctic until the ship was finally freed in February 1904.Preston, pp. 67‚Äì69 After returning to regular naval duty, Crean was promoted to petty officer, first class, on Scott's recommendation.Smith, p. 70 Between expeditions, 1904‚Äì1910 Crean came back to regular duty at the naval base at Chatham, Kent, serving first in Pembroke in 1904 and later transferring to the torpedo school on Vernon. Crean had caught Captain Scott's attention with his attitude and work ethic on the Discovery Expedition, and in 1906 Scott requested that Crean join him on Victorious.Crean, Royal Navy service record, referenced in Smith, p. 72 Over the next few years, Crean followed Scott successively to Albemarle, Essex and Bulwark. By 1907, Scott was planning his second expedition to the Antarctic. Meanwhile, Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, 1907‚Äì09, despite reaching a new furthest south record of 88¬∞23'S, had failed to reach the South Pole.Crane, pp. 394‚Äì95 Scott was with Crean when the news of Shackleton's near miss became public; it is recorded that Scott observed to Crean: \\"I think we'd better have a shot next.\\"Preston, p. 101  Terra Nova Expedition, 1910‚Äì1913  Scott's polar party at 87¬∞S, 31 December 1911, before Crean's return with the last supporting party Scott held Crean in high regard,Huxley, p. 434 so he was among the first people recruited for the Terra Nova Expedition, which set out for the Antarctic in June 1910, and one of the few men in the party with previous polar experience. After the expedition's arrival in McMurdo Sound in January 1911, Crean was as part of the 13-man team who established \\"One Ton Depot\\", from Hut Point.Cherry-Garrard, p. 107 so named because of the large amount of food and equipment cached there on the projected route to the South Pole. Returning from the depot to base camp at Cape Evans, Crean, accompanied by Apsley Cherry-Garrard and Henry \\"Birdie\\" Bowers, experienced near-disaster when camping on unstable sea ice. During the night the ice broke up, leaving the men adrift on an ice floe and separated from their sledges. Crean probably saved the group's lives, by leaping from floe to floe until he reached the Barrier edge and was able to summon help.Cherry-Garrard, p. 147 Petty officers Edgar Evans and Crean mending sleeping bags (May 1911) Crean departed with Scott in November 1911, for the attempt at the South Pole. This journey had three stages: across the Barrier, up the heavily crevassed Beardmore Glacier to an altitude of above sea level, and then another to the Pole.Smith, p. 102 At regular intervals, supporting parties returned to base; Crean was in the final group of eight men that marched on to the polar plateau and reached 87¬∞32'S, from the pole. Here, on 4 January 1912, Scott selected his final polar party: Crean, William Lashly and Edward Evans were ordered to return to base, while Scott, Edgar Evans, Edward Wilson, Bowers and Lawrence Oates continued to the pole. Crean's biographer Michael Smith suggests that Crean would have been a better choice for the polar party than Edgar Evans, who was weakened by a recent hand injury (of which Scott was unaware). Crean, considered one of the toughest men in the expedition, had led a pony across the Barrier and had thus been saved much of the hard labour of man- hauling.Smith, p. 161 Scott's critical biographer Roland Huntford records that the surgeon Edward L Atkinson, who had accompanied the southern party to the top of the Beardmore, had recommended either Lashly or Crean for the polar party rather than Edgar Evans.Huntford (The Last Place on Earth), p. 455 Scott in his diary recorded that Crean wept with disappointment at the prospect of having to turn back, so close to the goal.Scott, Diary, 4 January 1912, reprinted in Smith, p. 123 left Soon after heading north on the journey back to base camp, Crean's party lost the trail back to the Beardmore Glacier, and were faced with a long detour around a large icefall.Smith, p. 127 With food supplies short, and needing to reach their next supply depot, the group made the decision to slide on their sledge, uncontrolled, down the icefall. The three men slid ,Smith, p. 129 dodging crevasses up to wide, and ending their descent by overturning on an ice ridge.Lashly's diary, quoted in Cherry- Garrard, p. 402 Evans later wrote: \\"How we ever escaped entirely uninjured is beyond me to explain\\". The gamble at the icefall succeeded, and the men reached their depot two days later. However, they had great difficulty navigating down the glacier. Lashly wrote: \\"I cannot describe the maze we got into and the hairbreadth escapes we have had to pass through.\\"Lashly diary, quoted in Preston, p. 207 In his attempts to find the way down, Evans removed his goggles and subsequently suffered agonies of snow blindness that made him into a passenger.Preston, pp. 206‚Äì08 When the party was finally free of the glacier and on the level surface of the Barrier, Evans began to display the first symptoms of scurvy.Crane, pp. 555‚Äì56 By early February he was in great pain, his joints were swollen and discoloured, and he was passing blood. Through the efforts of Crean and Lashly the group struggled towards One Ton Depot, which they reached on 11 February. At this point Evans collapsed; Crean thought he had died and, according to Evans's account, \\"his hot tears fell on my face\\". With over still to travel before the relative safety of Hut Point, Crean and Lashly began hauling Evans on the sledge, \\"eking out his life with the last few drops of brandy that they still had with them\\". On 18 February they arrived at Corner Camp, still from Hut Point, with only one or two days' food rations left and still four or five days' man-hauling to do. They then decided that Crean should go on alone, to fetch help. With only a little chocolate and three biscuits to sustain him, without a tent or survival equipment,Cherry-Garrard, p. 420 Crean walked the distance to Hut Point in 18 hours, arriving in a state of collapse to find Atkinson there, with the dog driver Dmtri Gerov.Smith, p. 140 Crean reached safety just ahead of a fierce blizzard, which probably would have killed him, and which delayed the rescue party by a day and a half. Atkinson led a successful rescue, and Lashly and Evans were both brought to base camp alive. Crean modestly played down the significance of his feat of endurance. In a rare written account, he wrote in a letter: \\"So it fell to my lot to do the 30 miles for help, and only a couple of biscuits and a stick of chocolate to do it. Well, sir, I was very weak when I reached the hut.\\"Crean, letter to unknown person, 26 February 1912, reprinted in Smith, p. 143 Scott's party failed to return. The winter of 1912 at Cape Evans was a sombre one, with the knowledge that the polar party had undoubtedly perished. Frank Debenham wrote that \\"in the winter it was once again Crean who was the mainstay for cheerfulness in the now depleted mess deck part of the hut.\\"Smith, p. 168 In November 1912, Crean was one of the 11-man search party that found the remains of the polar party. On 12 November they spotted a cairn of snow, which proved to be a tent against which the drift had piled up. It contained the bodies of Scott, Wilson, and Bowers.Crane, pp. 569‚Äì70. Oates and Edgar Evans has perished earlier on the return journey. Crean later wrote, referring to Scott in understated fashion, that he had \\"lost a good friend\\".Crean letter to J. Kennedy, January 1913, SPRI, reprinted in Smith, p. 172 On 12 February 1913 Crean and the remaining crew of the Terra Nova arrived in Lyttelton, New Zealand, and shortly after returned to England. At Buckingham Palace the surviving members of the expedition were awarded Polar Medals by King George and Prince Louis of Battenberg, the First Sea Lord.Smith, p. 180 Crean and Lashly were both awarded the Albert Medal, 2nd Class for saving Evans's life, these were presented by the King at Buckingham Palace on 26 July 1913. Crean was promoted to the rank of chief petty officer, retroactive to 9 September 1910.Smith, p. 183 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (Endurance Expedition), 1914‚Äì1917 Members of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition aboard Endurance, 1914. Crean is second from the left in the first standing row. Shackleton (wearing soft hat) is in the centre of the picture. Shackleton knew Crean well from the Discovery Expedition, and also knew of his exploits on Scott's last expedition. Like Scott, Shackleton trusted Crean:Huntford: Shackleton, p. 477 he was worth, in Shackleton's own word, \\"trumps\\".Alexander, p. 21 Crean joined Shackleton's Imperial Transantarctic Expedition on 25 May 1914, as second officer,Smith, p. 190 with a varied range of duties. In the absence of a Canadian dog-handling expert who was hired but never appeared, Crean took charge of one of the dog-handling teams,Shackleton, pp. 44‚Äì45 and was later involved in the care and nurture of the pups born to one of his dogs, Sally, early in the expedition.Alexander, pp. 29‚Äì31 On 19 January 1915 the expedition's ship, the Endurance, was beset in the Weddell Sea pack ice. In the early efforts to free her, Crean narrowly escaped being crushed by a sudden movement in the ice.Shackleton, p. 31 The ship drifted in the ice for months, eventually sinking on 21 November. Shackleton informed the men that they would drag the food, gear, and three lifeboats across the pack ice, to Snow Hill or Robertson Island, away. Because of uneven ice conditions, pressure ridges, and the danger of ice breakup which could separate the men, they soon abandoned this plan: the men pitched camp and decided to wait. They hoped that the clockwise drift of the pack would carry them to Paulet Island where they knew there was a hut with emergency supplies.Alexander, p. 98 But the pack ice held firm as it carried the men well past Paulet Island, and did not break up until 9 April. The crew then had to sail and row the three ill- equipped lifeboats through the pack ice to Elephant Island, a trip which lasted five days. Crean and Hubert Hudson, the navigating officer of the Endurance, piloted their lifeboat with Crean effectively in charge as Hudson appeared to have suffered a breakdown.Alexander, p. 127Smith, p. 226 left Upon reaching Elephant Island, Crean was one of the \\"four fittest men\\" detailed by Shackleton to find a safe camping-ground.Shackleton, p. 147 Shackleton decided that, rather than waiting for a rescue ship that would probably never arrive, one of the lifeboats should be strengthened so that a crew could sail it to South Georgia and arrange a rescue. After the party was settled on a penguin rookery above the high-water mark, a group of men led by ship's carpenter Harry McNish began modifying one of the lifeboats‚Äîthe James Caird‚Äîin preparation for this journey, which Shackleton would lead. Frank Wild, who would be in command of the party remaining on Elephant Island, wanted the dependable Crean to stay with him; Shackleton initially agreed, but changed his mind after Crean begged to be included in the boat's crew of six.Shackleton, p. 158 The boat journey to South Georgia, described by polar historian Caroline Alexander as one of the most extraordinary feats of seamanship and navigation in recorded history, took 17 days through gales and snow squalls, in seas which the navigator, Frank Worsley, described as a \\"mountainous westerly swell\\".Worsley, p. 142Alexander, p. 153 After setting off on 24 April 1916 with just the barest navigational equipment, they reached South Georgia on 10 May 1916. Shackleton, in his later account of the journey, recalled Crean's tuneless singing at the tiller: \\"He always sang when he was steering, and nobody ever discovered what the song was ... but somehow it was cheerful\\".Shackleton, p. 174 right The party made its South Georgia landfall on the uninhabited southern coast, having decided that the risk of aiming directly for the whaling stations on the north side was too great; if they missed the island to the north they would be swept out into the Atlantic Ocean.Alexander, p. 150 The original plan was to work the James Caird around the coast, but the boat's rudder had broken off after their initial landing, and some of the party were, in Shackleton's view, unfit for further travel. The three fittest men‚ÄîShackleton, Crean, and Worsley‚Äîwere decided to trek across the island's glaciated surface, in a hazardous 36-hour journey to the nearest manned whaling station.Alexander, p. 156 This trek was the first recorded crossing of the mountainous island, completed without tents, sleeping bags, or map‚Äîtheir only mountaineering equipment was a carpenter's adze, a length of alpine rope, and screws from the James Caird hammered through their boots to serve as crampons.Worsley, pp. 190‚Äì91 They arrived at the whaling station at Stromness, tired and dirty, hair long and matted, faces blackened by months of cooking by blubber stoves‚Äî\\"the world's dirtiest men\\", according to Worsley.Worsley, p. 213 They quickly organized a boat to pick up the three on the other side of South Georgia, but thereafter it took Shackleton three months and four attempts by ship to rescue the other 22 men still on Elephant Island.Worsley, p. 220 Later life After returning to Britain in November 1916, Crean resumed naval duties. On 15 December 1916 he was promoted to the rank of warrant officer (as a boatswain), in recognition of his service on the Endurance,Admiralty Certificate of Qualification for Warrant Officer, 17 August 1917, referenced in Smith, p. 300 and was awarded his third Polar Medal. On 5 September 1917, Crean married Ellen Herlihy of Annascaul. In early 1920, Shackleton was organising another Antarctic expedition, later to be known as the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition. He invited Crean to join him, along with other officers from the Endurance. By this time, however, Crean's second daughter had arrived, and he had plans to open a business following his naval career. He turned down Shackleton's invitation.Smith, p. 308 On his last naval assignment, with , Crean suffered a bad fall which caused lasting effects to his vision. As a result, he was retired on medical grounds on 24 March 1920.Smith, p. 304 He and Ellen opened a small public house in Annascaul, which he called The South Pole Inn.Smith, p. 309 The couple had three daughters, Mary, Kate, and Eileen,Smith, p. 306 although Kate died when she was four years old. Throughout his life, Crean remained an extremely modest man. When he returned to Kerry, he put all of his medals away and never again spoke about his experiences in the Antarctic. Indeed, there is no reliable evidence of Crean giving any interviews to the press.Smith, p. 312 It has been speculated that this may have been because Kerry was a hotbed of Irish nationalism and later Irish republicanism, and, along with County Cork, an epicentre of violence. The Crean family were once subject to a Black and Tan raid during the Irish War of Independence. Their inn was ransacked until the raiders happened across Crean's framed photo in Royal Navy dress uniform and medals. They then left his inn.Interview with his daughter, Mary O'Brien \\"RT√â ‚Äì Charlie Bird on the trail of Tom Crean\\" Crean's older brother was Cornelius Crean, a sergeant in the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). Cornelius was based in County Cork, where he served with the RIC during the War of Independence.Frank McNally, 'An Irishman's Diary', The Irish Times, p. 17. Dublin, Saturday, 23 April 2016. Sgt. Crean was killed during an IRA ambush near Upton on 25 April 1920. upright In 1938, Crean became ill with a burst appendix. He was taken to the nearest hospital in Tralee, but as no surgeon was available, he was transferred to the Bon Secours Hospital in Cork, where his appendix was removed. Because the operation had been delayed, an infection developed, and after a week in the hospital he died on 27 July 1938, shortly after his sixty-first birthday. He was buried in his family's tomb at the cemetery in Ballynacourty, Corkaguiney, County Kerry.

The tower is used to support broadcast antennas for TV and FM transmitters located at the CBC- owned and operated facility. History Sponsored by CFRA-FM owner Frank Ryan, the tower was erected at the foot of the Carp Ridge near the town of Hazeldean, Ontario (present-day Ottawa), by helicopter in 1961. Its top was above sea level, making it the highest point in the Ottawa/Gatineau area and was an easy-to-spot landmark. The tower would later be disassembled and relocated to the Camp Fortune site for improved coverage. A portion of the tower still exists and is visible from Hazeldean Road.

It is an early and prominent example of the \\"inverted detective story\\", claimed to have been invented by R. Austin Freeman some years earlier. The murderer's identity is revealed in the first line of the novel, which gives the reader insight into the workings of his mind as his plans progress. It also contains elements of black comedy, and of serious treatment of underlying tensions in a superficially respectable community. It is loosely based on the real-life case of Herbert Armstrong, with elements of Doctor Crippen.  Plot summary  Edmund Bickleigh, a physician with a modest rural practice, is in a loveless marriage with the domineering childless Julia, He consoles himself with young unmarried women, in particular the accommodating Ivy. In his village arrives Madeleine, a rich young woman, who succumbs to his attentions but warns she will not marry him if he divorces. Reasoning that she will however marry him if he is a widower, he cruelly starts to poison Julia. To relieve her increasing pain he gives her increasing doses of morphine, until she dies miserably. Madeleine then rejects him, to marry a wealthy young man, while the rejected Ivy also marries a well-off lawyer. Rumours start spreading that Julia's death was not accidental, fuelled by the antagonism towards Edmund of Madeleine's husband and Ivy's husband, who both bitterly resent that he was the seducer of their wives. Attempting to stop the gossip, Edmund poisons both men and Madeleine as well, though only Madeleine's husband dies. Not unaware of the rumours and the suspicious deaths, the police investigate and Edmund is put on trial. Acquitted of murdering his unfortunate wife, a second trial convicts him for the death of Madeleine's husband and he is executed.  Adaptations  The novel has been adapted for television twice. The first was a four-part serial by the BBC in 1979, starring Hywel Bennett as Dr. Bickleigh, Cheryl Campbell as Madeleine, and Judy Parfitt as Julia. It later aired in 1981 when it was featured in the US PBS series, Mystery!, introduced by Vincent Price. A second adaptation Malice Aforethought, starring Ben Miller as Dr. Bickleigh, Megan Dodds as Madeleine, and Barbara Flynn as Julia, was produced by Granada Television and broadcast on ITV in 2005. It too has been shown on Mystery! in 2005.

The lake is south of the river Po and north of the nearby river Tiber, has a surface area of and is the fourth for surface area in Italy. (It is slightly smaller than Lake Como.) Only two minor streams flow directly into the Lake and none flows out. The water level of the lake fluctuates significantly according to rainfall levels and the seasonal demands from the towns, villages and farms near the shore. The lake Trasimeno is shallow, muddy, and rich in fish, including pike, carp, and tench. During the last 10 years it has been 5 meters deep, on average. Lake Trasimeno is an apparently endorheic body of water with no natural above- ground outlet. However, the Romans dug an artificial drainage tunnel in the San Savino area, which was restored in the Renaissance; a modern canal, the Emissario del Trasimeno, was built in 1898,Touring Club of Italy, Umbria, 2003, , p. 64 flowing into the Caina, the Nestore, and eventually the Tiber. The shallow waters meant that malarial mosquitoes prospered. To combat malaria, some mosquito larvae-eating fish were imported from the United States during the 1950s. These fish are widely scattered, and some live in the lakes near Trasimeno. Although billions of larvae are eaten, there are still many mosquitoes and other insects. The lake's water quality is still very good, as a study by conservation group Italia Nostra showed in 2005. This is believed to be largely due to the small population and a lack of large farms in the area. A proposal to drain the lake to solve the problems of malaria and depth changes was rejected. At the end of the 19th century, the level changes were solved by building a channel near San Feliciano. This also lessened the malaria problem. =Origins and early history= Three million years ago, there was a shallow sea in this part of Umbria. A depression formed by geologic fractures allowed the present-day Lake Trasimeno to form. Historically, Trasimeno was known as the Lake of Perugia, being important for northwestern Umbria and for the Tuscan Chiana district. In prehistoric times, this lake extended almost to Perugia. Trasimeno is a mythological figure, joined with Agilla, a nymph born in Agello, now a hill midway between Perugia and Trasimeno, formerly an island in the lake. The first civilization to inhabit this area was the Etruscans; three of the main Etruscan cities - Perugia, Chiusi, and Cortona - are within of the lake. Little physical evidence remains from the period of Etruscan or later Roman settlement. Castiglione del Lago has some Roman ruins and its main streets are structured like a chessboard in the Roman style. The Battle of Lake Trasimeno occurred on the northern shore of the lake in April 217 B.C. during the Second Punic War. The exact location of the battle is unknown because the lake then extended further north; the battle could have been fought between Cortona and Tuoro. Near Cortona, there is a place called 'Ossaia', in Italian meaning ossuary. Another place with reference to the battle is the place named Sanguineto, whose name is connected with the Italian term \\"sangue\\" meaning blood or, probably, bloody place. =Local climate= The Trasimeno climate is fairly warm, with moderate winters. Summers can be very warm and humid, but in general the lake moderates the climate both in cold and warm conditions because even shallow water gives a moderate thermic inertia. From May to September, the temperature is high enough to allow swimming. In 1929, a cold winter froze the whole of the lake's surface, and cars could be driven over the ice. Cold winters in 1957, 1985 and 2002 caused heavy damage to the olive trees nearby. A less severe freeze happened in 1991. Given the latitude of the lake freezing remains a rare occurrence. =Water level= The water level of the lake is very dependent on the amount of seasonal rain and can change significantly from one year to the other. The water level is usually at its minimum level after summer (in September or October) and at its highest during spring (in April or May). Trasimeno has high hills to the east, which help to capture rain and partially protect the lake from cold eastern winds. Most of the water in the lake comes from the network of streams on the western side of the lake. The reference water level of the lake is set at 257.33 AMSL. This level corresponds to a maximum depth of around 6m. Actions are planned to reduce the water level when it climbs above 257.60 AMSL, but since the maximum level was set the lake has reached that height only occasionally. July 2007, a fishing boat on Lake Trasimeno July 2008. The same boat in the same position shows how Trasimeno was suffering by water's scarcity. Since 2011, the situation has improved. After World War II, the lake's shores retreated a kilometre in the west (the eastern shore is deeper and more steeply sloped). In 1958 the water of the lake reached the lowest recorded level, at -2.63m vs reference level. Since 1958 the level increased again to reach reference level in June 1989. After the water level started again to fall, and in 2003 the shore retreated over and the level fell in October 2003 to -1.85m vs reference. From 2004 to the summer of 2006, there was plenty of rain. of rain fell during the last 20 days of August 2005 and over during the remaining part of the year. During the following five years rain was insufficient (especially in 2006 and 2007 winters were very dry and summers hot) so by October 2012 the water level was -1.51m vs reference. Fortunately, since 2012 winters have been very rainy so the level of the lake has progressively increased to reach in February 2014 the reference level. In April 2014 the water level increased further to reach 0.30m above reference. A channel from the reservoir at Montedoglio in Tuscany to supply agriculture and lakeside towns (and thereby eliminate the need to draw water from the lake) was opened in 2012. =Conservation= The inhabitants of the communes around Trasimeno and the Umbrian people have successfully protected their lake, whose waters are fit for swimming and whose valleys and islands are intact environments. In 1995 a natural park was established over the entire surface and the shores. A bicycle path was opened in 2003 around the lake that allows tourists to explore it. There are also cross-country paths, especially over the hills on the eastern side. During the last twenty years several alien species (Louisiana crawfish, black bullhead, stone moroko and goldfish) have been introduced in the lake, putting under threat the autochthonous water life. The goldfish was the first alien species to be introduced in the lake and today accounts for about 50% of the total fish presence. The lake's environs The lake seen by southern mountains, Cortona on the right Half of Trasimeno is surrounded by hills, rich in olives that are an important agricultural resource. On the western shore, near Tuscany, there are vineyards, and fruit and vegetables are grown. The hills are much lower and the climate is warmer. Monte Subasio near Assisi, about to the east, and Monte Amiata, about to the west, can be seen. The vegetation includes pines, willows and poplars around the shores, many over 30 m tall. The main towns are Passignano sul Trasimeno, Tuoro, Monte del Lago, Torricella, San Feliciano, San Arcangelo, Castiglione del Lago, and Borghetto. Castiglione del Lago has the longest shore, being on the only significant peninsula of the lake. This may have been an island that was joined to the shore by the Romans. Surrounding the lake are old small towns, and isolated castles, like Zocco castle and a tower near Passignano. Monte del Lago was originally built to control the road from Trasimeno to Perugia. =Aviation= The buildings are now used as social centers. The local airport, the Eleuteri, near Castiglione del Lago, was once one of the main aviation schools in Italy, with elegant buildings that were destroyed by retreating German troops in the summer of 1944. This airport was once almost as big as Castiglione. The mild climate and perfect visibility still allow the use of this airport for air meetings. A social center exists in the former airport. A major watercourse, the Paganico torrent, separated the airport from the town. More than 200 aircraft come to the airshow, all light machines, because the strip is grass- covered Before this airport was constructed, there was a hydroscale in Castiglione del Lago. On the opposite shore, in Passignano, around away, there was an aircraft factory, the SAI Ambrosini. This is now abandoned as an industrial center, but is still used as an association center. It was founded around 80 years ago and the buildings still exist near the Passignano sul Trasimeno railway station. This company made several types of aircraft, designed by eng. Sergio Stefanutti. Aircraft were tested at Eleuteri airport, only few kilometers away from this factory. SAI was involved mainly with Macchi during World War II. Eleuteri was also used as test center for the Ambrosini SS.4, advanced canard aircraft, which crashed in the second flight and the project was abandoned. =Communications= Trasimeno is relatively far from every major Italian city, the nearest of which is Perugia. The Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway was completed in 1866, with the main rail station in Terontola, which has been at the junction with the Florence‚ÄìRome railway since 1875. Smaller railway stations are in Passignano and Castiglione del Lago. Because of increased traffic, about 30 years ago a highway was built over the Passignano's road to Perugia. This highway passes near the north and the east shores of Trasimeno and goes to Perugia and Assisi. Many smaller roads, such as state highway 75, are also present, especially on the western side of the lake. The Autostrada A1 passes five kilometers () to the west of the Lake. =Navigation= Strict regulations apply for the navigation on the Lake. A protected strip is established for the entire perimeter of Lake Trasimeno for a distance of 150 meters from the shore of the lake and the shore of the islands. In the protected strip navigation is only permitted for craft having a maximum length of 9 meters at the waterline, propelled by oars or by sail, at a maximum speed of two knots. Exceptions apply to authorised boats propelled by motor only in the water in front of port areas or authorized landing places. There are ferryboats, 3 small, 2 medium, and two big (two decks) called Perusia and Agilla II, based in Passignano Port, also two dredges. There are ports in Castiglione del Lago (recently totally rebuilt), S. Arcangelo, S. Feliciano, Tuoro, and several minor anchorages. Islands Maggiore, Minore and Perusia ferryboat, seen by a hill cultivated with olives There are three islands in the lake. The largest of these islands is Isola Polvese, almost 1 km2. The second largest, Isola Maggiore, is the only inhabited one. The small fishing village, which reached its height in the 14th century, today has only around thirty residents. Most of the buildings, including the ruins of a Franciscan monastery, date from the 14th century. Maggiore is a 'hill', whereas Polvese is a more complex structure with plains and hills, and Minore resembles a sloped table. Minore is now uninhabited, but in the past had a village with over 500 residents. Many centuries ago, a castle with a pentagonal structure stood near the shore, near an Olivetan monastery. The castle still remains, and the ruins of the church and the monastery are almost totally preserved, despite the abandonment in the 17th century due to malaria. The malaria was eradicated only in the 1950s. There were other problems, since Trasimeno was fought over by Chiusi, Panicale, Perugia, and Florence. Polvese Island seen by C.Lago Florentine troops demolished Polvese in the 17th century, beginning its decline, until by the 19th century there was only a caretaker. Of the many houses, nothing remains. Minore Isle, near Maggiore, is now uninhabited, totally covered by local vegetation except for a small anchorage. In ancient times, there was a separation between the two communities, because Polvese was far away from Maggiore-Minore. According to local stories, the two communities fought against each other but the real problems were from the regional 'powers' that fought over this lake for centuries. A fishing technique, called 'Tuoro' or 'pesca da tuori', was used locally. This complex system consisted of a wooden trap in the water and a circular structure to hold the net around it. The nets trapped the fish that were then taken to the village to be dried. This system worked with a high water level, but was abandoned when the level dropped. A mock up of this system was built several years ago near Polvese Isle's port. Trasimeno's castles Maggiore Castle, now in ruins There are castles all around Trasimeno, many in the center of small towns while others are isolated and in ruins. Castiglione del Lago, Passignano, Magione, Maggiore, and Polvese islands all have castles, while Zocco castle, Montali castle, and others are on hilltops. The Guglielmi castle in Maggiore Isle was built in the late 19th century on the foundation of an old Franciscan church, and for many years was a popular place in the Trasimeno area. Until 1998 it was still visitable, then it was closed because the structure became dangerously unstable. It is now being restored by a new proprietor, but the work is far from completed. The ruins of Zocco castle Between Monte del Lago and S.Feliciano is Zocco castle, ruined for decades. It is privately owned but unmaintained. It is one of the biggest castles of the area and the only one that, inside its sandstone walls, has a still untouched medieval keep. Some years ago it was probably inhabited, as there is a building fitted with a TV antenna, but now its only entry is closed. The best-preserved parts are the eastern and the southern walls, increasingly endangered because the wall's faults are enlarging. The rest of the walls are mostly demolished or have fallen down. One of the southern towers has two enormous cracks in the middle. The Vernazzano leaning tower (N43 13.210 E12 06.084), around in height, leans like the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa. This unique remnant of an ancient castle was built before 1089, when the Marchiones family donated the whole castle to the monastery of Citt√† di Castello. In 1202, it fell under control of Perugia and this city gained control of Northern Trasimeno. It was built on M.te Castiglione, near two rivers. The castle and the surrounding settlement at Vernazzano, were damaged by wars in 15th century and two centuries later, by a strong earthquake and after-shocks. Erosion of the foundations by water caused the tower to lean in the 18th century. Vernazzano was rebuilt in the valley, away from this site, which had been effective for territorial control but was less well-suited for living in. The Leaning Tower has therefore been abandoned for almost 300 years. To avoid its collapse, a steel reinforcement was recently added, with plates and wires as thick as . The Tower is not well known, being located away from the main streets. It is visible from far away, but not easily accessible. Image gallery File:Treesinthelake.jpgTree remains on Trasimeno's shores.

Life Alberic was a hermit in the forest of Collan in France who, along with five other hermits, invited Abbot Robert of Molesme to begin a new monastery with them that would operate under the Rule of St. Benedict. Robert led these hermits to the forest of Molesme and established a religious settlement there in 1075, Molesme Abbey. Robert served as the first abbot, and Alberic as the prior. However, as the settlement's fame grew, gifts came in and the wealth attracted new monks more lax in their observance of the rule. The Molesme community was divided, and the monks opposed Robert and Alberic. Robert twice left the monastery to live as a hermit, and twice the pope ordered him back to his community. During one of Robert's absences, the brothers imprisoned Alberic so that they might have their way. The stricter group left Molesme for C√Æteaux.

It is the moderation or mean between selfishness and selflessness ‚Äì between having more and having less than one's fair share.Aristotle, Ethics (1976) p. 186 Justice is closely related, in Christianity, to the practice of Charity (virtue) because it regulates the relationships with others. It is a cardinal virtue, which is to say that it is \\"pivotal\\", because it regulates all such relationships, and is sometimes deemed the most important of the cardinal virtues. Early developments According to Aristotle, \\"Justice consists in a certain equality by which the just and definite claim of another, neither more nor less, is satisfied.\\" This is equal insofar as each one receives what he is entitled to, but may be unequal insofar as different people may have different rights: two children have different rights from a certain adult if that adult is the parent of one of them and not of the other. Aristotle developed the idea of equity to cover irregular cases so that \\"the ordinance is framed to fit the circumstances\\".Aristotle, p. 198-200 Macrobius saw Justice as existing on four different planes or levels, rising from the everyday political virtue at the lowest to the Archetypal Form of Justice at the highest.C. S. Lewis, The Discarded Image (1976) p. 68-9 Christianity The just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his neighbor.Catechism of the Catholic Church, ¬ß1807 In Colossians 4:1 St. Paul counsels \\"Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, realizing that you too have a Master in heaven.\\" In Christian moral theology, Justice is a quality or habit which perfects the will and inclines it to render to each and to all what belongs to them. The object of the virtue of justice is the other person's rights, whether natural or bestowed by Church or State. Justice requires that all persons should be left in the free enjoyment of all their rights. The rights which belong to every human being inasmuch as he is a person are absolute and inalienable.Slater, Thomas. \\"Justice.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 7 April 2017 In Aristotle's wake,Aristotle, p. 182-3 Thomas Aquinas developed a theory of proportional reciprocity, whereby the just man renders to each and all what is due to them in due proportion: what it is their moral and legal rights to do, possess, or exact.D. Manuel Jr, Contemporary Social Philosophy (nd) p. 58 Justice toward God is called the \\"virtue of religion\\". Modern developments With the late modern rise in interest in virtue ethics, a new interest in articulating the virtue of justice has emerged. John Rawls saw justice as the typical virtue of the institution; Irene van Staveren saw it as that of the state, marked by such indicators as votes, legitimacy, public fairness and distributive rules.Deidre McCloskey, The Bourgeois Virtues (2007) p. 286 and p. 431 Psychology Moral justice has been linked to the sixth and highest of Kohlberg's stages of moral development.L. P. Nucci, Handbook of Moral and Character Education (2008) p. 60 Freudians consider that in the unconscious the image of the Father embodies a stern but fair justice;Eric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychooanalysis (1976) p. 45 Jungians similarly see the archetype of the King as representing the right ordering of society.R. Bly/M. Woodman, The Maiden King (1999) p. 155 In literature Dante made Justice the virtue of his sixth heaven (the sphere of Jupiter), and illustrated it through such martial figures as Joshua and Roland.Dante, Paradise (1975) p. 215 Sir Philip Sydney wrote of \\"justice the chief of virtues\\";Sidney, A Defence of Poetry (1984) p. 31 Edmund Spenser devoted the fifth book of The Faerie Queene to the same theme.Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (1971) p. 201 Wallace Stevens rejected what he called \\"galled Justicia/Trained to poise the tables of the law\\" as part of the obsolete images of the past, and favoured instead the modernist seeking out of new ruling images ‚Äì new \\"sovereigns of the soul\\".Wallace Stevens, Collected Poems (1984) p. 124 See also References * External links *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Justice as a Virtue *Summa Theologica \\"Second Part of the Second Part\\" See Questions 57-122 Christian ethics Justice Virtue ","title":"Justice (virtue)"},{"id":"1769195","text":"Aaron Fricke is an American gay rights activist and author.

Court case  Shortly after he came out in 1980, Fricke began seeing another male student. Fricke decided to bring him as his date to the prom. When the high school informed Fricke he could not bring him to the prom, he filed suit in U.S. District court. The presiding judge, Raymond J. Pettine, ruled in Fricke's favor, ordering the school to not only allow him and his partner to attend as a couple but also to provide enough security to ensure their safety.ACLU: Who are you taking to the prom this year? The case received considerable media attention,Chicago Tribune: Private matters now get taken to the prom (payment required for full article) and news camera crews filmed and interviewed the couple at the dance. The case set a precedent that has been used across the United States to establish a legal right for students to bring same sex partners to school proms and other school social events.ACLU: Free Speech, Free Expression and Prom  Writing  Fricke later wrote of his experience in a book, Reflections of a Rock Lobster: A Story about Growing Up Gay. He later collaborated with his father, Walter, on Sudden Strangers: the Story of a Gay Son and his Father, a book about their relationship and of the elder Fricke's coming to terms with his son's homosexuality. That book was published shortly after Walter Fricke's death from cancer in 1989. In 2012 and 2013, Boston Children's Theatre presented a play based on the book, adapted by Burgess Clark. The play received national attention for its anti-bullying message. BCT became the first children's repertory theater in the United States to portray gay rights issues with this production.

It has a similar plot to The Craft and released in the same year, though Little Witches had a much smaller budget. Plot Faith Ferguson (Mimi Rose) is a relatively shy but intelligent teenager who is heartbroken when her mother informs her that she must spend Easter break at her Catholic girls' school as opposed to coming home. She's roomed with the rebellious Jamie (Sheeri Rappaport), who initially scandalizes Faith with her wild antics. Despite her initial misgivings, Faith finds herself bonding slightly with Jamie and the four other teen misfits that had to remain behind - Erica, Gina, Nicole, and Kelsey. The group is soon intrigued when construction work on the school's church uncovers a Satanic temple containing the mummified remains of several schoolgirls believed to have gone missing almost a hundred years ago. The girls venture into the temple one night while everyone is asleep and they discover an ancient book written in Latin. Faith is fluent in Latin and translates the book, which outlines a spell that will summon a demon from the pits of hell. Jamie and some of the other girls are eager to practice the spell, but Faith is reticent due to the spell requiring a virgin sacrifice - especially after learning that the schoolgirls were murdered by a guardian devoted to keeping the spell from being cast. This reluctance, along with her interactions with a handsome construction worker named Daniel (Tommy Stork), helps alienate her from Jamie, who was somewhat attracted to him. Things grow more tense when the teens return to the hidden room and discover that there is still a guardian around, as the room was covered in graffiti that warned them that summoning the demon would lead to their deaths. Because Faith has refused to help translate the rest of the book, Jamie decides to play a cruel trick on her by inviting Daniel to their room and making it appear as if he was trying to rape her. The girls' young schoolteacher, Sister Sherilyn (Jennifer Rubin), provides Faith with some guidance and has her bring meals to Mother Clodah (Zelda Rubinstein), a strange nun bearing a distinctive birthmark on her face. This ends up being to Faith's benefit, as she manages to avoid falling under one of Jamie's spells by praying with Mother Clodah. Unfortunately the encounter also ends with Mother Clodah's death due to Jamie poisoning her meal, believing Mother Clodah to be the guardian. Jamie, who has taught herself to read Latin due to Faith's refusal to translate, proceeds with the spell as planned. The movie implies that the teens will use Faith as a sacrifice due to her virginal nature, but Jamie ends up using Daniel instead after she learns that he is also a virgin. Horrified that they are moving forward with the spell, Faith receives help from Sister Sherilyn, who reveals that she is the guardian. They manage to stop the ceremony in time to save Daniel, but at the cost of the lives of Jamie and all of the other girls involved with the spell.

In particular, the students objected to watching a scene in which the character Jean-Pierre harasses Mireille as she sits in a park and then being required to \\"pretend you were trying to pick up a pretty woman in a park.\\" Some also objected to camera angles focusing on Mireille's legs, or breasts when she isn't wearing a bra. Its creator, Prof. Capretz, a French native who has taught at Yale since 1956, said [he] \\"wouldn't change any of it.\\" To teach French effectively, he said, \\"you have to make the students observe the language being used by native speakers, in real situations.\\" In response, the French department at Yale determined that the course would be changed by developing supplementary materials to be used in the course.

Heraldic eagles can be found throughout world history like in the Achaemenid Empire or in the contemporary Republic of Indonesia. The European post-classical symbolism of the heraldic eagle is connected with the Roman Empire on one hand (especially in the case of the double-headed eagle), and with Saint John the Evangelist on the other. History A golden eagle was often used on the banner of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. Eagle (or the related royal bird vareghna) symbolized khvarenah (the God-given glory), and the Achaemenid family was associated with eagle (according to legend, Achaemenes was raised by an eagle). The local rulers of Persis in the Seleucid and Parthian eras (3rd-2nd centuries BC) sometimes used an eagle as the finial of their banner. Parthians and Armenians used eagle banners, too.Alireza Shapur Shahbazi (December 15, 1994), \\"DERAF≈†\\", Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. VII, Fasc. 3, pp. 312-315. =European heraldry= Carolingian ivory plaque with the Eagle of Saint John with halo, Victoria & Albert Museum. An early heraldic eagle in the seal of Vienna (1239) Homberg (Z√ºrich armorial, c. 1340). At this time, the black-on-gold eagle could still be used for a family of the lower nobility without association to the imperial eagle. Frederick IV of Germany (1446)Die Wappen der Deutschen Landesf√ºrsten (= J. Siebmachers gro√ües Wappenbuch) vol. 1 part 2-5 (reprint), Nuremberg (1909-1929). Charles V (Jakob Kallenberg 1545) In Europe the iconography of the heraldic eagle, as with other heraldic beasts, is inherited from early medieval tradition. It rests on a dual symbolism: On one hand it was seen as a symbol of the Roman Empire (the Roman Eagle had been introduced as the standardised emblem of the Roman legions under consul Gaius Marius in 102 BC); on the other hand, the eagle in early medieval iconography represented Saint John the Evangelist, ultimately based on the tradition of the four living creatures in Ezekiel. In early heraldry or proto-heraldry of the 12th century, however, the eagle as a heraldic charge was not necessarily tied to either imperial or biblical symbolism. The Anglo-Norman L'Aigle family, who held Pevensey castle and the Borough of Pevensey used the eagle as an emblem in an instance of canting arms. The earliest known use of the eagle as a heraldic charge is found in the Great Seal of Leopold IV of Austria, dated 1136.Carl- Alexander von Volborth Adalbert I, Duke of Teck used an eagle in his seal in c. 1190. By the late medieval period, in German heraldry, the eagle developed into a symbol of the empire, and thus became comparatively rare outside of coats of arms derived from the imperial emblem. The first evidence of the use of the double-headed Reichsadler (imperial eagle) dates to the mid-13th century (Chronica Majora, c. 1250; Segar's Roll, c. 1280). The German kings still use the single-headed eagle throughout the 14th century. In Italy, the Ghibelline faction (the faction loyal to the emperor in the drawn-out conflict between emperors and popes) began to display or an eagle sable in chief of their coats of arms, known as capo dell'impero or \\"chief of the empire\\".The Complete Book of Heraldry by Stephen Slater (), page 201. Similarly, German cities began to incorporate the imperial eagle into their seals and coats of arms to imply imperial immediacy. From such usage, use of the heraldic eagle by the end of the medieval period became so strongly associated with the empire that the eagle was rarely used as an independent heraldic charge. Examples of continued use of eagle coats of arms based on traditions of the 13th century include the Polish, Moravian and Silesian coats of arms. By far the oldest and most common manner of depicting the eagle in heraldry is what would come to be known as displayed (√©ploy√©e), in direct imitation of Roman iconography. The eagle's body is depicted with lateral symmetry, but its head is facing the dexter side. In late medieval blasons, the term \\"eagle\\" (Middle French egle) without specification refers to an \\"eagle displayed\\". In early modern English terminology, it became common to use \\"eagle displayed\\". Also specific to English heraldry is the distinction between \\"eagle displayed with its wings elevated\\" and \\"eagle displayed with wings inverted\\". This is due to a regional English convention of depicting the tips of the wings pointing upward, while in continental heraldry, the tips of the wings were depicted downward (\\"inverted\\"). Later, English heraldry partially adopted the continental convention, leading to a situation where it was unclear whether the two forms should be considered equivalent. In German heraldry, no attitude other than \\"eagle displayed with wings inverted\\" ever became current, so that the simple blason of \\"eagle\\" (Adler) still refers to this configuration. There is a gradual evolution of the standard depiction of the heraldic eagle over the course of the 12th to 16th centuries. In the 12th to 13th century, the head is raised and the beak is closed. The leading edge of the wings (in German heraldry termed Sachsen or Saxen, representing the main bones in the bird's wing, humerus and ulna) are rolled up at the ends into a spiral shape, with the remiges shown vertical. The tail is represented as a number of stiff feathers. By the later 14th century, the head is straightened, and the beak opens, with the tongue becoming visible. The rolling-up of the leading edge of the wings disappears. The claws now form an acute angle relative to the body, occasionally receiving a \\"hose\\" covering the upper leg. The tail feathers now spread out in curved lines. In the 15th century, the leading edge of the wings become half-circles, with the remiges no longer vertical but radiating outward. The legs form a right angles. In the 16th century, eventually, the depiction of the eagle becomes more extravagant and ferocious, the animal being depicted \\"it in as ornamental and ornate a manner as possible\\". Fox- Davies (1909) presents a schematic depiction of this evolution, as follows: File:Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig440.png13th century: curled wing edges, straight tail feathers, vertical legs File:Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig441.pnglate 14th century: curved wing edges (vertical remiges), curved tail feathers, legs at an acute angle File:Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig442.png15th century: wing edges pointing upward (radiating remiges), more ornate tail feathers, legs at a right angle File:Jindrich starsi Modling.jpg13th century example (Henry I, Duke of M√∂dling 1203) File:Karel4 orlice.jpg14th century example (Charles IV 1349) File:Wernigeroder Wappenbuch 024.jpg15th century example (Wernigeroder Wappenbuch c. 1480) Depiction The depiction of the heraldic eagle is subject to a great range of variation in style. The eagle was far more common in continental European‚Äîparticularly German‚Äîthan English heraldry, and it most frequently appears Sable (colored black) with its beak and claws Or (colored gold or yellow). It is often depicted membered (having limbs of a different color than the body) / armed (an animal depicted with its natural weapons of a different color than the body) and langued (depicted having a tongue of a different color than the body) gules (colored red), that is, with red claws / talons and tongue. In its relatively few instances in Gallo-British heraldry (e.g. the arms of the Earls of Dalhousie) the outermost feathers are typically longer and point upward. =Parts= Head An eagle can appear either single- or double-headed (bicapitate), in rare cases triple-headed (tricapitate) eagle is seen. Recursant describes an eagle with his head turned to the sinister (left side of the field). In full aspect describes an eagle with his head facing the onlooker. In trian aspect (a rare, later 16th and 17th century heraldry term) describes when the eagle's head is facing at a three-quarter view to give the appearance of depth ‚Äì with the head cocked at an angle somewhere between profile and straight-on. Wings thumb1. Eagle close. 2\\\\. Eagle rising, wings elevated and addorsed. 3\\\\. Eagle rising, wings elevated and displayed. 4\\\\. Eagle rising, wings addorsed and inverted. 5\\\\. Eagle rising, wings displayed and inverted. Overture or close is when the wings are shown at the sides and close to the body, always depicted statant (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field). (Trussed - the term when depicting domestic or game birds with their wings closed - is not used because the eagle is a proud animal and the word implies it is tied up or bound by a net.) Addorsed (\\"back to back\\") is when the eagle is shown statant (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field) and ready to fly, with the wings shown open behind the eagle so that they almost touch. Espanie or √©pandre (\\"expanded\\") is when the eagle is shown affront√© (facing the viewer with the head turned to the dexter) and the wings are shown with the tips upward. Abais√© or abaiss√© (\\"lowered\\") is when the eagle is shown affront√© (facing the viewer) and the wings are shown with the tips downward. A good example is the eagle on the reverse side of the US quarter-dollar coin. Klee- Stengeln (\\"clover-stems\\") are the pair of long-stemmed trefoil-type charges on the wings of 13th-century German depictions of the heraldic eagle. They represent the upper edge of the wings and are normally Or (yellow), like the beak and claws. Reinmar von Zweter fashioned the Klee-Stengeln of his eagle into a second and third head.Reinmar von Zweter's peculiar eagle is famously depicted in the Codex Manesse. =Attitudes (positions)= Eagle displayed The informal term \\"spread eagle\\" is derived from a heraldic depiction of an eagle displayed (i.e. upright with both wings, both legs, and tailfeathers all outstretched). The wings are usually depicted \\"expanded\\" or \\"elevated\\" (i.e., with the points upward); displayed inverted is when the wings are depicted points downward. According to Hugh Clark, An Introduction to Heraldry, the term spread eagle refers to \\"an eagle with two heads, displayed\\", but this distinction has apparently been lost in modern usage. Most of the eagles used as emblems of various monarchs and states are displayed, including those on the coats of arms of Germany, Romania, Poland and the United States. Displayed is the most common attitude, with examples going back to the early Middle Ages. Eagle rousant Eagle essorant (rousant) An eagle rising or rousant (essorant) is preparing to fly, but its feet are still on the ground. It is the eagle's version of statant (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field). *with wings addorsed and elevated means in profile with the wings swept to the back and their tips extended upwards. *with wings addorsed and inverted means in profile with wings swept to the back and their tips extended downwards. *with wings displayed and elevated means facing to the front with the wings spread and their tips extended upwards. *with wings displayed and inverted means facing to the front with the wings spread and their tips extended downwards. There is sometimes confusion between a rousant eagle with displayed wings and a displayed eagle. The difference is that rousant eagles face to the right and have their feet on the ground and displayed eagles face the viewer, have their legs splayed out, and the tail is completely visible. There is a debate over whether rousant or displayed is the eagle's default depiction. Eagle volant Volant describes an eagle in profile shown in flight with wings shown addorsed and elevated and its legs together and tucked under. It is considered in bend (\\"diagonal\\") as it is flying from the lower sinister (heraldic left, from the shield-holder's point of view) to the upper dexter (heraldic right, from the shield-holder's point of view) of the field. However, the term \\"in bend\\" is not used unless a bend is actually on the field. Eagles combatant Like the heraldic lion, the heraldic eagle is seen as dominating the field and normally cannot brook a rival. When two eagles are depicted on a field, they are usually shown combatant, that is, facing each other with wings spread and one claw extended, as though they were fighting. Respectant, the term used for depicting domestic or game animals shown facing each other, is not used because eagles are aggressive predators. Eagles addorsed When two eagles are shown back-to-back and facing the edges of the field the term used is addorsed / endorsed or adoss√©s (\\"back-to- back\\"). =Variants= Eagle decapitate (without head), coat of arms of German nobility von der Hoven, alias: \\"Pampus\\". Eaglet This term is used when three or more Eagles are shown on a field. They represent immature eagles. Alerion Originally the term erne or alerion in early heraldry referred to a regular eagle. Later heralds used the term alerion to depict baby eagles. To differentiate them from mature eagles, alerions were shown as an eagle displayed inverted without a beak or claws (disarmed). To difference it from a decapitate (headless) eagle, the alerion has a bulb-shaped head with an eye staring towards the dexter (right-hand side) of the field. This was later simplified in modern heraldry as an abstract winged oval. An example is the arms of the Duchy of Lorraine (Or, on a Bend Gules, 3 Alerions Abais√© Argent). It supposedly had been inspired by the assumed arms of crusader Geoffrey de Bouillon, who supposedly killed three white eaglets with a bow and arrow when out hunting.Rothery, Guy Cadogan. Concise Encyclopedia of Heraldry. pp.50 It is far more likely to be canting arms that are a pun based on the similarities of \\"Lorraine\\" and \\"erne\\". Imperial Eagle The Aquila was the eagle standard of a Roman legion, carried by a special grade legionary known as an Aquilifer, from the second consulship of Gaius Marius (104 BC) used as the only legionary standard. It was made of silver, or bronze, with outstretched wings. The eagle was not immediately retained as a symbol of the Roman Empire in general in the early medieval period. Neither the early Byzantine emperors nor the Carolingians used the eagle in their coins or seals. It appears that the eagle is only revived as a symbol of Roman imperial power in the high medieval period, being featured on the sceptres of the Ottonians in the late 10th century, and the double-headed eagle gradually appearing association with the Komnenos dynasty in the 11th and 12th centuries. =Holy Roman Empire= Reconstruction of the 14th-century royal flag (K√∂nigsfahne), with a single- headed eagle, the predecessor of the 15th-century imperial flag with the double-headed imperial eagle The eagle is used as an emblem by the Holy Roman Emperors from at least the time of Otto III (late 10th century), in the form of the \\"eagle-sceptre\\". Frederick Barbarossa ( 1155‚Äì90) is reported as having displayed an eagle on his banner, Otto IV ( 1209‚Äì15) an eagle hovering over a dragon.Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1897), s.v. \\"Banner\\". The first evidence of the use of the Reichsadler (imperial eagle) proper dates to the mid-13th century. Matthew Paris' Chronica Majora (c. 1250) displays a coat of arms with a black double-headed eagle in a yellow field for Otto IV. Segar's Roll (c. 1280) displays the same coat of arms, or, an eagle sable beaked and armed gules for the \\"king of Germany\\" (rey de almayne). Outside of these exceptional depictions (in sources from outside of Germany), the double-headed eagle remains unattested as emblem of the German kings or emperors until the 1430s. In the 14th century, the German kings use the royal banner (K√∂nigsfahne) with the single-headed eagle. The earliest pictorial representations of this date to the first half of the 14th century (Codex Balduini). This banner develops into the Reichssturmfahne (imperial war flag) with the double-headed Reichsadler (imperial eagle) by the mid-15th century. Sigismund (r. 1433-37) still uses either the single-headed or the double-headed eagle. Consistent use of the double-headed eagle only begins with the Habsburg emperors (with Frederick III, 1440). After 1558 (Ferdinand I), the title of King of the Romans is used for the emperor's heir apparent; the double-headed eagle now represents the emperor, and the single-headed eagle the emperor's heir apparent (thus, Ferdinand IV, King of the Romans, who pre-deceased his father in 1654 and never became emperor, is given a single-headed eagle only). =Byzantine imperial eagle= Double-headed eagle emblem of the Byzantine Empire. The head on the left (West) symbolizes Rome, the head on the right (East) symbolizes Constantinople. Relief from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul) Use of the double-headed eagle is first attested in Byzantine art of the 10th century. Its use as an imperial emblem, however, is considerably younger, attested with certainty only in the 15th century, i.e. at about the same time the double-headed eagle was also adopted in the Holy Roman Empire. There are speculative theories according to which the double- headed eagle was first introduced as a dynastic emblem of the Komnenoi, from as early as the 11th century. The Palaiologoi emperors appear to have used the double-headed eagle often as ornamental emblem on their robes etc. during the 13th and 14th century, but only in the 15th century as an emblem on coins or seals. In the 15th century, the double-heade eagle was first used as an emblem by the semi-autonomous Despots of the Morea, who were younger imperial princes, and by the Gattilusi of Lesbos, who were Palaiologan relatives and vassals. The double-headed eagle was used in the breakaway Empire of Trebizond as well. Western portolans of the 14th‚Äì15th centuries use the double-headed eagle (silver/golden on red/vermilion) as the symbol of Trebizond rather than Constantinople. Single-headed eagles are also attested in Trapezuntine coins, and a 1421 source depicts the Trapezuntine flag as yellow with a red single- headed eagle. Apparently, just as in the metropolitan Byzantine state, the use of both motifs, single and double-headed, continued side by side. Other Balkan states followed the Byzantine model as well: chiefly the Serbians, but also the Bulgarians and Albania under George Kastrioti (better known as Skanderbeg), while after 1472 the eagle was adopted by Muscovy, when Ivan III of Russia married Sophia, daughter of Thomas Palaiologos. The Serbian eagle (in the modern coat of arms of Serbia, 1882) is derived from the coat of arms of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty (16th century), in turn derived from the Byzantine imperial eagle. Use of the double-headed eagle for Serbia is among the examples of early representations in Western portolans (Angelino Dulcert 1339).  Eagle of Saint John  Eagle of Saint John from the Book of Dimma (8th century) John the Evangelist, the author of the fourth gospel account, is symbolized by an eagle, often with a halo, an animal may have originally been seen as the king of the birds. The eagle is a figure of the sky, and believed by Christian scholars to be able to look straight into the sun. The better known heraldic use of the Eagle of St. John has been the single supporter chosen by Queen Isabella of Castile in her armorial achievement used as heiress and later integrated into the heraldry of the Catholic Monarchs. This election alludes to the queen's great devotion to the evangelist that predated her accession to the throne.VV. AA., Isabel la Cat√≥lica en la Real Academia de la Historia, Real Academia de la Historia, 2004. . Cfr. para la her√°ldica de Isabel y Fernando las pp. 72 & ff. There is a magnificent tapestry with the armorial achievement of the Catholic Monarchs in the Throne Room of the Alcazar of Segovia. The Eagle of St. John was placed on side of the shields used as English consort by Catherine of Aragon, daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, Mary I and King Philip as English monarchs. In Spain, Philip bore the Eagle of St John (single or two figures depending versions) in his ornamented armorial achievements until 1668.Francisco Olmos, Jos√© Mar√≠a de.

Coat of arms of Spain . The use of the eagle of St. John was exploited by the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, who used it as a symbol of his regime. The Eagle of St. John's is also frequently used in modern civic heraldry. Piast and P≈ôemyslid dynasties The eagles in the Polish, Moravian and Silesian coats of arms are based on 13th-century dynastic arms. The Silesian Piasts was the first branch of Piast dynasty to use an eagle for their coat of arms. The first documented use of the Upper Silesian Eagle was on the Casimir I of Opole's seal in 1222 and was later followed by the first use of the Lower Silesian Eagle by the Henry II the Pious in 1224. Przemys≈Ç II was the first Polish ruler to use the Polish Eagle as a coat of arms to represent the whole of Poland in 1295. The Margraviate of Moravia from at least the 1270s used a chequered eagle. The Moravian Eagle (without chequering) was first documented on the seal of Ottokar's uncle, Margrave P≈ôemysl (d. 1239) and is thus likely derived from the coat of arms of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty, who in the early 13th century used a \\"flaming eagle\\" coat of arms alongside the Bohemian lion for the Kingdom of Bohemia.

The representation of the American Eagle is thus a unique combination between a naturalistic depiction of the bird, and the traditional heraldic attitude of the \\"eagle displayed\\". The American Eagle has been a popular emblem throughout the life of the republic, with an eagle appearing in its current form since 1885, in the flags and seals of the President, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Justice Department, Defense Department, Postal Service, and other organizations, on various coins (such as the quarter-dollar), and in various American corporate logos past and present, such as those of Case and American Eagle Outfitters. French Empire Coat of arms of the First French Empire The French Imperial Eagle or Aigle de drapeau (lit. \\"flag eagle\\") was a figure of an eagle on a staff carried into battle as a standard by the Grande Arm√©e of Napoleon I during the Napoleonic Wars. Although they were presented with Regimental Colours, the regiments of Napoleon I tended to carry at their head the Imperial Eagle. This was the bronze sculpture of an eagle weighing , mounted on top of the blue regimental flagpole. They were made from six separately cast pieces and, when assembled, measured in height and in width. On the base would be the regiment's number or, in the case of the Guard, Garde Imp√©riale. The eagle bore the same significance to French Imperial regiments as the colours did to British regiments - to lose the eagle would bring shame to the regiment, who had pledged to defend it to the death. Upon Napoleon's fall, the restored monarchy of Louis XVIII of France ordered all eagles to be destroyed and only a very small number escaped. When the former emperor returned to power in 1815 (known as the Hundred Days) he immediately had more eagles produced, although the quality did not match the originals. The workmanship was of a lesser quality and the main distinguishing changes had the new models with closed beaks and they were set in a more crouched posture. Napoleon also used the French Imperial Eagle in the heraldry of the First Empire, as did his nephew Napoleon III during the Second Empire. An eagle remains in the arms of the House of Bonaparte and the current royal house of Sweden retains the French Imperial Eagle on its dynastic inescutcheon, as his founder, Jean Bernadotte, was a Marshal of France. Other national emblems *The coat of arms of Panama (1904), has an eagle rising with wings displayed and elevated on place of a crest. Since 2002 the eagle is officially specified as a harpy eagle. *The coat of arms of Jordan (1921) featured an eagle before the development of the \\"Eagle of Saladin\\" emblem. *The coat of arms of Iceland (1944) has an eagle or griffin (Gammur) among its supporters. *The coat of arms of the Philippines (1946) includes the bald eagle of the United States. *The national emblem of Indonesia (1950) has a Garuda (mythological bird) styled after the Javan hawk-eagle *The coat of arms of Ghana (1957) has two tawny eagles as supporters. *Coat of arms of Nigeria (1960) *The coat of arms of Mexico (1968) shows a Mexican golden eagle devouring a rattle snake. *The coat of arms of Namibia (1990) has an African fish eagle. *The flag of Kazakhstan has a soaring steppe eagle. *The coat of arms of Armenia (1992) has an eagle and a lion for the Artaxiad dynasty. *The coat of arms of South Sudan (2011) has an African fish eagle. *The emblem of Kyrgyzstan (2016) has a hawk. Military badges Emblem of the Sri Lanka Air Force Naturalistic eagles are often used in military emblems, such as the emblem of the Royal Air Force (United Kingdom), NATO School, the European Personnel Recovery Centre, etc. =Eagle of Saladin= In Arab nationalism, with the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the eagle became the symbol of revolutionary Egypt, and was subsequently adopted by several other Arab states (the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Libya, the partially recognised State of Palestine, and Yemen). The eagle is commonly identified as Saladin's emblem due to his yellow flag was adorned with an eagle, as well as the depiction of an Egyptian vulture on the west wall of the Cairo Citadel which was built during the rule of Saladin. The current design of the eagle itself, however, is of more recent date specifically after the Egyptian revolution of 1952. As a heraldic symbol identified with Arab nationalism, the Eagle of Saladin was subsequently adopted as the coats of arms of Iraq and Palestine. It has previously been the coat of arms of Libya, but later replaced by the Hawk of Quraish. The Hawk of Quraish was itself abandoned after the Libyan Civil War. The Eagle of Saladin was part of the coat of arms of South Yemen prior to that country's unification with North Yemen. =Zimbabwe Bird= The stone-carved Zimbabwe Bird is the national emblem of Zimbabwe, appearing on the national flags and coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and Rhodesia (since 1924), as well as on banknotes and coins (first on Rhodesian pound and then Rhodesian dollar). It probably represents the bateleur eagle or the African fish eagle. The bird's design is derived from a number of soapstone sculptures found in the ruins of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe.

A dewlap is a longitudinal flap of skin that hangs beneath the lower jaw or neck of many vertebrates. While the term is usually used in this specific context, it can also be used to include other structures occurring in the same body area with a similar aspect, such as those caused by a double chin or the submandibular vocal sac of a frog. In a more general manner, the term refers to any pendulous mass of skin, such as a fold of loose skin on an elderly person's neck, or the wattle of a bird. Dewlaps can be considered as a caruncle, defined as 'a small, fleshy excrescence that is a normal part of an animal's anatomy'. Mammals A zebu with a large dewlap. Many mammals such as dogs, rabbits and moose possess dewlaps. In zebu cattle, the dewlap is colloquially known as the \\"briefcase folds\\". The dewlap is also found on female rabbits, such as the New Zealand white rabbit. While pregnant, the female rabbit will pluck fur from the dewlap to line a nest for her babies. Although these masses can be referred to as dewlaps, they are formed by stored fat. The dewlap is also seen in both sexes of moose. Reptiles and birds An anole lizard in Costa Rica repeatedly protracting and retracting its dewlap. Many reptiles have dewlaps, most notably the anole family of lizard, which have large skin dewlaps they can extend and retract. The anole family has been found to have enhanced vision for color and depth perception. This family is able to see dewlap coloration from a far distance, giving the dewlap use and importance. These dewlaps are usually of a different color from the rest of their body and, when enlarged, make the lizard seem much bigger than it really is. The dewlap is primarily used when indicating territorial boundaries and for males to attract females during the mating season. Studies have found that the pigments generating this color are pterins and carotenoids. These two pigments are the most easily seen through the anole's eyes. Pterin and carotenoid pigments are located throughout the tissue of the dewlap, creating yellow and red hues. Lizards usually accompany their dewlap movement with head bobs and other displays. The dewlap moves through extension and contraction. The muscles creating this movement are known as the ceratohyoid muscles connected to the hyoid apparatus. These muscles controlling movement of the dewlap are around the throat and larynx. This is also where the motorneurons, the neurons signaling the dewlap movement, are found. Though much uncertainty resides around the purpose of these displays, the color of the dewlap and the head bobs are thought to be a means of contrasting background noise. An iguana with an extended dewlap. Many birds also have dewlaps, such as domestic chickens, some cracids and some guans.

He was born in the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty. Pujie was the younger brother of Puyi, the last Emperor of China. After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Pujie went to Japan, where he was educated and married to Saga Hiro, a Japanese noblewoman. In 1937, he moved to Manchukuo, where his brother ruled as Emperor under varying degrees of Japanese control during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945). After the war ended, Pujie was captured by Soviet forces, held in Soviet prison camps for five years, and then extradited back to the People's Republic of China, where he was incarcerated for about 10 years in the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre. He was later pardoned and released from prison by the Chinese government, after which he remained in Beijing where he joined the Communist Party and served in a number of positions in the party until his death in 1994.Pu Jie, 87, Dies, Ending Dynasty Of the Manchus\\", New York Times, March 2, 1994. Names Pujie's Manchu name was ; Pu-giye, his courtesy name Junzhi, and his art name Bingfan. Zeng Guofan was a source of inspiration for Pujie's art name, Bingfan. Bingfan means \\"live up to (the legacy of Zeng Guo)fan\\". Early life Prince Chun (left), and his older brother, Puyi (right). Pujie was the second son of Zaifeng (Prince Chun) and his primary consort, Youlan. As a child, he was brought to the Forbidden City in Beijing to be a playmate and classmate to his brother, Puyi. A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor.Cotter, Kids Who Rule, pp.76 In 1929, Pujie travelled to Japan and was educated in the Gakushuin Peers' School. He became fluent in Japanese. Later, he enrolled at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and graduated in July 1935. Pujie was first married in 1924 to a Manchu noblewoman, Tang Shixia, but they had no children. He left his wife behind when he went to Japan, and the marriage was dissolved some years later. After graduating from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, Pujie agreed to an arranged marriage with a Japanese noblewoman. He selected Saga Hiro, who was a relative of the Japanese imperial family, from a photograph from a number of possible candidates vetted by the Kwantung Army.Lebra, Above the Clouds pp.213 As Puyi did not have an heir, the wedding had strong political implications, and was aimed at both fortifying relations between the two countries and introducing Japanese blood into the Manchu imperial family. The engagement ceremony took place at the Manchukuo embassy in Tokyo on 2 February 1937 with the official wedding held in the Imperial Army Hall at Kudanzaka, Tokyo, on 3 April. In October, the couple moved to Hsinking, the capital of Manchukuo, where Puyi was then the Emperor. Life in Manchukuo As Puyi had no children, Pujie was regarded as first in line to succeed his brother as the emperor of Manchukuo; the Japanese officially proclaimed him the heir presumptive. However, Pujie was not appointed by his brother as the heir to the throne of the Qing dynasty, as imperial tradition stated that a childless emperor should choose his heir from a subsequent generation instead of from his own generation. While in Manchukuo, Pujie served as honorary head of the Manchukuo Imperial Guards. He returned briefly to Japan in 1944 to attend the Army Staff College. At the time of the collapse of Manchukuo during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, Pujie initially attempted to escape to Japan with his brother. However, as it became apparent that no escape was possible, he opted to return to Hsinking in an unsuccessful attempt to surrender the city to forces of the Republic of China, rather than have the city fall into foreign hands. Pujie was arrested by the Soviet Red Army and first sent to a prison camp in Chita, and then to another in Khabarovsk along with his brother and other relatives. He spent about five years in the Soviet prison camps until 1950, when the Sino-Soviet rapprochement allowed him and his fellow captives to be extradited to the newly founded People's Republic of China. Life in the People's Republic of China On his return to China, Pujie was incarcerated in the War Criminals Management Centre in Fushun, Liaoning. A model prisoner, he was eventually pardoned and released from prison by the Chinese government. He joined the Communist Party and served in a number of positions. In 1978, Pujie became a deputy from Shanghai at the 5th National People's Congress. He subsequently served as Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Committee of the 6th National People's Congress in 1983. He was appointed Deputy Head of the China-Japan Friendship Group from 1985. He rose to a seat on the Presidium of the 7th National People's Congress in 1988. From 1986, Pujie was also Honorary Director for the Handicapped Welfare Fund.Mackerras, The Cambridge Handbook of Contemporary China. PP73 Pujie was also a technical adviser for the 1987 film The Last Emperor directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. On 28 November 1991, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Ritsumeikan University. He died of illness at 07:55 on 28 February 1994 in Beijing at the age of 87. His body was cremated and half of his ashes were buried in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, while the other half were buried in Beijing.

Pujie married Tang when he was 17, but did not get along well with her. In 1926, Tang became Zhang Xueliang's mistress and broke ties with Pujie and his family. When Pujie went to Japan for his studies, Tang had another affair ‚Äì this time with Lu Xiaojia (ÁõßÁ≠±Âòâ), the son of the warlord Lu Yongxiang.

It is bordered by Arlington to the east, Old Place to the south, Newark Bay to the north, and the Arthur Kill to the west. The area bore the name of Milliken originally, and became locally known as Port Ivory after Ivory Soap, one of the best-known products from Procter & Gamble, which operated a factory at the site from 1907 until 1991, when the soap making operation was moved to Mexico. Located nearby is the Howland Hook Marine Terminal. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which leases the Howland Hook facility is contracting out the construction of an intermodal rail yard using part of the former Ivory Soap factory site to help with ship to rail transshipment. Another transportation resource is the North Shore branch of the Staten Island Railway, which crosses the Arthur Kill on its own Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, adjacent and parallel to the Goethals Bridge, and eventually reaches Cranford Junction, New Jersey. However, passenger trains stopped serving the Port Ivory (formerly Milliken) station several years before passenger service on the branch as a whole ceased in 1953, and freight activity on the line became rare by the 1970s and nonexistent by the beginning of the 1990s. Efforts to restore the freight service by the New York City Economic Development Corporation were completed in June 2006. The Arlington Yard re-built connected to the new ExpressRail terminal at the marine terminal. The Staten Island Expressway is sometimes cited as Port Ivory's southern boundary. The island's (and New York City's) lone mobile home park is on Goethals Road North, a service road of the expressway; the only other residents of the heavily industrial neighborhood live in a few older single-family homes a short distance to the east, along Forest Avenue.

Biography Aldrovandi was born on 23 September 1668 in Bologna, then part of the Papal States, and studied law at the local university, being awarded a doctorate in canon and civil law in 1691. He entered the Roman Curia five years later and then steadily climbed the career ladder in the administration and was ordained priest in 1710, served as a charg√© d'affaires in the nunciature in Spain from 1712 to 1716. On 5 October 1716 he became titular archbishop of Neocaesarea and was appointed Nuncio in Spain in 1717. However, the political troubles between the Holy See and the King of Spain led to his being recalled to Bologna, where he stayed until the death of Pope Clement XI. On 23 March 1729, he was made titular Patriarch of Jerusalem and was made Governor of Rome and later in 1733 he was appointed Vice-chamberlain of the Apostolic Camera. Aldrovandi was created Cardinal priest in the consistory of 24 March 1734 with the title of Sant'Eusebio. In 1734 he was appointed archbishop with personal title to the diocese of Montefiascone. He participated in the conclave of 1740, where the elections were stalled for forty days because many cardinals kept voting for him, despite their being unable to elect him, as they could not secure the required two-thirds majority. In the conclave Cardinal Lambertini, who was later elected Pope Benedict XIV, said to the College of Cardinals: \\"If you wish to elect a saint, choose Gotti; a statesman, Aldrovandi; an honest man, me.\\"Michael J.

Marsden is located on the outskirts of the seaside town South Shields, North East England, located on the North Sea coast. Background Marsden was originally a small village, consisting of farms, a few cottages and a lighthouse at Souter Point. Local industry consisted of a small limestone quarry. The nearby Marsden Bay includes the Marsden Rock sea stack. The Leas, located to the north, is an important seabird sanctuary. This land, along with Souter Lighthouse (the first lighthouse in the world to be powered by alternating current), is now owned by the National Trust. Marsden is best known for its beaches including Marsden Beach, with the famous Marsden Rock and pub, the Marsden Grotto. The beaches stretch along to the beach known locally as Boatie's Bay. Whitburn Colliery In the 1870s, the Whitburn Coal Company bought the five local quarries, two of which were developed as the Lighthouse (Marsden) Quarries. An attempt to develop a shaft into the Northumberland Coalfield failed in 1874 because of water ingress, but in 1877 a second development using the Kind- Chaudron process, created access to the Bensham seam through two diameter shafts. No.1 shaft had a depth of and No.2, a depth of . The company built the twin-track South Shields, Marsden, and Whitburn Colliery Railway, leaving the North Eastern Railway line at , South Shields and travelling to Marsden via two intermediate stations. Built to serve the colliery and opened in May 1879, the line served the Lighthouse limestone quarry, a paper manufactory, and local farms. On 19 March 1888, the line opened to the public. Marsden village The industrial development of the area required additional workers. The company built a new Marsden village, located between the Lighthouse Quarries and Whitburn Colliery. Designed to house more than 700 people, there were 135 houses across nine streets, a church and Methodist chapel, Co-op store, Post Office, school, and a Miners Institute. Located directly on the cliff top, resulting in an exposed and often weather-beaten experience, many wives refused to move to the village, meaning that most miners lived in South Shields and commuted daily using the newly constructed railway. The village gave its name to the \\"Marsden Rattler\\", a passenger train which ran on the railway via the North Eastern Railway main line to . By the time of nationalisation in 1945 into the National Coal Board, the site employed just under 1,500 miners. The railway line itself became the first nationalised passenger line on 1 January 1947. Passenger service was officially withdrawn on 14 November 1953, but trains ran until 23 November. Marsden boasts two well-known pubs, the Marsden Grotto and the Marsden Inn. The Inn is located on Marsden Lane while the Grotto is hewn in the cliffs facing Marsden Rock. There are a few shops including a reptile shop and several post offices up towards Cleadon Hills. Marsden Lane is the main street leading up to Lizard Lane, Marsden Lane begins at the bottom of Horsley Hill Square before stretching up.

Synopsis American movie star Johnny Tyrone goes to the Middle East to premiere his new picture. He is seduced by the lovely Aishah, then kidnapped by a man named Sinan who wants Johnny to help him kill the king in the town of Bar Esalaam. Johnny escapes the palace with the help of a slave girl, Shalimar. Once out of the palace walls Johnny tells her that he was brought to the Middle-East to assassinate the king which causes Shalimar to run off in fear as she turns out to be the king's daughter. Johnny meets up with his fellow escapee Zacha and make a plan to foil the assassination plan by joining a troupe of musicians who will be going to entertain the people of Bar Esalam on the last day of Ramadan. Johnny successfully befriends the troupe but that night they are ambushed by Aishah and her men after being betrayed by Zacha. Aishah orders Johnny to go through with the assassination after threatening the lives of the musicians and their children. Meanwhile Princess Shalimar can not shake the feelings she has for Johnny. On the day of the festivities Johnny reluctantly moves in to kill the King but is thwarted by Shalimar. Johnny, the musicians and the kids are sentenced to death. The troupe is spared death after they are rescued by their associate, a dwarf named Baba. Johnny breaks into the King's room and convinces him that he was blackmailed into the plot by Sinan and also confesses his love for Shalimar. The King believes Johnny and helps him infiltrate Sinan's lair where it is revealed that the man who orchestrated the assassination plot was none other than the King's brother Prince Dragna. Johnny manages to overpower Sinan but learns that his army has grown in number and taken the town by force. Johnny, The King, Shalimar, the musicians and the remorseful Zacha gather as many of the King's most loyal servants to battle the assassins and take back the town while the King enters Dragna's hideout vowing revenge.

Margaret Harford of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Nobody, least of all Elvis, can bring parody to heel in this effort from MGM, directed by Gene Nelson.

Born in Budapest, he went to high school at the Minta Gymnasium, but due to anti- Jewish laws he had to leave the country, gaining his master's degree at the Sorbonne in Paris. He obtained his doctorate in low-temperature physics in Berlin, working with Professor Franz Simon. However, when Adolf Hitler rose to power, both Simon and Kurti left Germany, joining the Clarendon Laboratory in the University of Oxford, England. During World War II he worked on the Manhattan project, returning to Oxford in 1945. In 1955 he won the Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize. In 1956, Simon and Kurti built a laboratory experiment that reached a temperature of one microkelvin. This work attracted worldwide attention, and Kurti was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He later became the society's Vice-President from 1965 to 1967. He became Professor of Physics at Oxford in 1967, a post he held until his retirement in 1975. He was also Visiting Professor at City College in New York City, the University of California, Berkeley, and Amherst College in Massachusetts.

The Xerox 914 was the first successful commercial plain paper copier which in 1959 revolutionized the document-copying industry. The culmination of inventor Chester Carlson's work on the xerographic process, the 914 was fast and economical. The copier was introduced to the public on September 16, 1959, in a demonstration at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel in New York, shown on live television. Background Xerography, a process of producing images using electricity, was invented in 1938 by physicist-lawyer Chester Floyd \\"Chet\\" Carlson (1906‚Äì1968), and an engineering friend, Otto Kornei. Carlson entered into a research agreement with the Battelle Memorial Institute in 1944, when he and Kornei produced the first operable copy machine. He sold his rights in 1947 to the Haloid Company, a wet-chemical photocopy machine manufacturer, founded in 1906 in Rochester, New York. Haloid introduced the first commercial xerographic copier, the Xerox Model A, in 1949. The company had, the previous year, announced the refined development of xerography in collaboration with Battelle Development Corporation, of Columbus, Ohio. Manually operated, it was also known as the Ox Box. An improved version, Camera #1, was introduced in 1950. Haloid was renamed Haloid Xerox in 1958, and, after the instant success of the 914, when the name Xerox soon became synonymous with \\"copy\\", would become the Xerox Corporation. In 1963, Xerox introduced the first desktop copier to make copies on plain paper, the 813. It was designed by Jim Balmer and William H. Armstrong of Armstrong- Balmer & Associates, and won a 1964 Certificate of Design Merit from the Industrial Designers Institute (IDI). Balmer had recently left Harley Earl, Inc., where he had been a designer since 1946, to co-establish Armstrong- Balmer & Associates in 1958. At Earl, Balmer had been involved in the Secretary copy machine designed for Thermofax and introduced by 3M in 1958, and Haloid Xerox had been impressed with the design, engaging Balmer to consult on the final design of the 914. A year later, in 1964, Balmer worked with Xerox to establish their first internal industrial design group. Among those first design employees were William Dalton and Robert Van Valkinburgh. Specifications and features One of the most successful Xerox products ever, the 914 model (so-called because it could copy originals up to 9 inches by 14 inches (229 mm √ó 356 mm)) could make 100,000 copies per month (seven copies per minute). In 1985, the Smithsonian received a Xerox 914, number 517 off the assembly line. It weighs approximately 650 poundsBrooks, p. 17 (294 kg) and measures 42\\" (107 cm) high √ó 46\\" (117 cm) wide √ó 45\\" (114 cm) deep. The machine was mechanically complex. It required a large technical support force, and had a tendency to catch fire when overheated. Because of the problem, the Xerox company provided a \\"scorch eliminator\\", which was actually a small fire extinguisher, along with the copier. But despite these problems, the machine was regarded with affection by its operators, due to it being complex enough to be interesting to use, but without being so complex as to be beyond understanding.Brooks, p. 18 The pricing structure of the machine was designed to encourage customers to rent rather than buy: it could be rented in 1965 for $25 per month, plus 10 cents per copy. There was a meter, which the customer would read to fill out and mail a card to Xerox each month. Its purchase price was $27,500, which was established by the US Government, as they would not rent equipment. The customer also bought paper and toner (ink) at a cost of about 5 cents per copy. Sales The 914 was a significant component of Xerox's revenues in the mid-1960s, with one author estimating that the machine accounted for two thirds of the company's revenue in 1965, with income generated of $243M. The machine was produced between 1960 and 1977. Legacy The company's subsequent models were the Xerox 710, the Xerox 1000, the Xerox 813 and the Xerox 2400. One writer has assessed that the popularity of the machine has had a number of lasting impacts, such as prompting the introduction of highlighter pens, and university courses switching from reading lists of single chapters from several paperbacks, to requiring a single compilation of those chapters produced by local copy shops.  In popular culture  The arrival of a Xerox 914 is a cultural signifier in the 2nd season of Mad Men, set in a 1961 Manhattan advertising agency. It is acquired specifically to impress a potential client with how modern the agency is.

Due to a lack of evidence to try him for the killings, which his followers had already received long sentences for, Murphy was released in 1982 and returned to the Shankill Road, where he embarked on a murder spree. Details on Murphy's movements were apparently passed by Ulster loyalist paramilitariesDillon, Martin (1999). The Shankill Butchers (2nd ed.). . to the Provisional IRA, who executed Murphy. William Moore (who had confessed to detectives soon after being arrested) was portrayed in subsequent police accounts as having been in effective control of the Butchers gang during Murphy's incarceration. However a 2017 book on the UVF asserted that John, an older brother of Murphy who escaped prosecution, had been directing the activities of the Butchers during that time. John Murphy died in a car crash during the 1990s. Early life Murphy was the youngest of three sons of William and Joyce Murphy from the loyalist Shankill Road, Belfast. His elder brothers were William Jr. and John. William Sr. was originally from Fleet Street, Sailortown in the Belfast docks area. This was where he had met Joyce Thompson, who came from the Shankill. Like his own father (also named William), William Sr. worked as a dock labourer.Dillon, pp. 1‚Äì2 The Murphy family changed their residence several times; in 1957 they returned to Joyce's family home in the lower Shankill, at 28 Percy Street. Murphy did not use \\"Hugh\\" possibly because when coupled with the surname Murphy it might have added to the Catholic connotation. Prior to the erection of a peace wall in the 1970s, Percy Street ran from the lower Shankill area to the Falls Road. At Argyle Primary School, he was known for the use of a knife and had his elder brothers to back him up; he logged his first conviction at the age of twelve for theft. After leaving the Belfast Boys' Model School at sixteen, he joined the Ulster Volunteer Force and was involved in the rioting that broke out in Belfast in August 1969. In his book The Shankill Butchers, Belfast journalist Martin Dillon suggests Murphy's bigoted Loyalism may have stemmed from his bearing a surname associated with Catholics.Dillon, Shankill Butchers, pp 4‚Äì9 His character was marked by a hatred of Catholics which he brought into all of his conversations, often referring to them as \\"scum and animals\\".Dillon, p. 8 He held a steady job as a shop assistant, although his increasing criminal activities enabled him to indulge in a flamboyant lifestyle which involved socialising with an array of young women and heavy drinking.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. New York: Routledge. pp. 17‚Äì18; Dillon wrote that it is \\"incredible to think that Murphy was in fact a murderer at the age of twenty\\" (1972). There were many people at the time who would have found it hard to believe as physically he did not differ from most young men of his age. Below average height, of slim build and sallow complexion, Murphy was blue eyed and had curly dark brown hair. He sported several tattoos; most of them bearing Ulster loyalist images.Dillon, p. 20 He was a flashy dresser, often wearing a leather jacket and scarf, and occasionally leather driving-gloves, such that it reminded one contact of the time of a World War I fighter-pilot.Dillon, p. 21 First crimes The Lawnbrook Social Club in Shankill Road's Centurion Street, one of Murphy's drinking haunts. It has since been demolished According to Dillon, Murphy was involved in the torture and murder of four Catholic men as early as 1972. On 28 September of that year, a Protestant man named William Edward Pavis who had gone bird shooting with a Catholic priest, was killed at his home in East Belfast. Pavis had been threatened by loyalists who accused him of selling firearms to the IRA. Murphy was arrested for this crime along with an accomplice, Mervyn Connor. During pre-trial investigations, Murphy was placed in a line-up for possible identification by witnesses to Pavis' shooting. Before the process began formally, he created a disturbance and stepped out of the line-up. However, two witnesses picked him out when order was restored.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers. Connor and Murphy were held in prison together but, in April 1973, before the trial, Connor died after ingesting cyanide in his cell. He had written a suicide note in which he confessed to the crime and exonerated Murphy. It is believed Connor was forced to write the note and take the cyanide. Murphy was sent to trial for the murder of Pavis in June 1973. Although two witnesses identified him as the gunman, he was acquitted on the basis that their evidence may have been affected by the disturbance during the police line-up inquiry. However, Murphy was re-arrested and jailed for attempted escapes.Dillon and Lehane, Political Murder in Northern Ireland (1973), pp. 125‚Äì27 By May 1975, Murphy, now aged twenty-three, was back on the streets of Belfast. On 5 May 1973, inside the Crumlin Road prison, he had married 19-year-old Margaret Gillespie, with whom he had a daughter.Dillon, p. 54 He moved his wife and child to Brookmount Street in the upper Shankill where his parents also had a new home; however, he spent much of his time drinking in Shankill pubs such as The Brown Bear and Lawnbrook Social Club. He also regularly frequented the Bayardo Bar in Aberdeen Street.Dillon, p. 7 Murphy later told a Provisional IRA inmate that on 13 August 1975 he had just left the Bayardo ten minutes before the IRA carried out a gun and bombing attack against the pub which killed a UVF man and four other Protestants and left over 50 injured.Stevenson, Jonathan (1996). We Wrecked the Place: contemplating an end to the Northern Irish Troubles. Free Press. p. 54 With his brother William he soon formed a gang of more than twenty men that would become known as the Shankill Butchers, one of his lieutenants being William Moore. Brookmount Street (2009), where Murphy lived close to the top of the Shankill Road Shankill Butchers murders The gang shot dead four Catholics (two men and two women) during a robbery at a warehouse in October 1975. Over the next few months, the gang began abducting, torturing and murdering random Catholic men they dragged off the streets late at night. Murphy regarded the use of a blade as the \\"ultimate way to kill\\", ending the torture by hacking each victim's throat open with a butcher's knife. By February 1976 the gang had killed three Catholic men in this manner. Murphy achieved status through his paramilitary activity and was widely known in the Shankill. Many regarded his crimes as shaming the community but feared the consequences of testifying against him.BBC TV programme, 2011, Shankill Butchers, 60 mins,Dillon, Martin (1989). Shankill Butchers. pp 66‚Äì69, 115‚Äì31 None of the victims had any connection to the IRA, and there was suspicion among some of their families that the murders were not properly investigated because those being killed were Catholics. The Butchers were also involved in the murder of Noel Shaw, a loyalist from a rival UVF unit, who had shot dead Butcher gang-member Archie Waller in Downing Street, off the Shankill Road, in November 1975. Four days before his death, Waller had been involved in the abduction and murder of the Butchers' first victim, Francis Crossen. One day after Waller's death, Shaw was beaten and pistol-whipped by Murphy while strapped to a chair, then shot. His body was later dumped in a back street off the Shankill.Jordan, Milestones in Murder (centre pages with image of Shaw's body in basket) By the end of 1975, the UVF Brigade Staff had a new leadership of \\"moderates\\", but Murphy refused to submit to their authority, preferring to carry out attacks by his own methods. Dillon suggested that whilst some of the Brigade Staff knew about Murphy's activities (albeit not the precise details), they were too frightened of him and his gang to put a stop to them.Dillon, pp. 53‚Äì54 On 10 January 1976, Murphy and Moore killed a Catholic man, Edward McQuaid (25), on the Cliftonville Road. Murphy, alighting from Moore's taxi in the small hours, shot the man six times at close range. Imprisonment Early on 11 March 1976, Murphy shot and injured a young Catholic woman, once again on the Cliftonville. Arrested the next day after attempting to retrieve the gun used, Murphy was charged with attempted murder and remanded in custody for a prolonged period. However, he was able to plea bargain whereby he was allowed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of a firearms offence, and received twelve years' imprisonment on 11 October 1977. Dillon notes that the police believed Murphy was involved in the Shankill Butcher murders. To divert suspicion from himself Murphy ordered the rest of the gang to continue the cut-throat murders while he was in prison. The Butchers, now under the operational command of William Moore, went on to kill and mutilate at least three more Catholics. The team of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) detectives investigating the murders was led by Detective Chief Inspector Nesbitt who headed C Division based at Tennent Street off the Shankill Road. However the police were overworked during this period and little progress was made in the investigation until one victim, Gerard McLaverty, survived his assault. Detectives were driving him down the Shankill Road on the way to the scene of his abduction when he recognised two of his assailants walking in the street. This identification of Sam McAllister and Benjamin Edwards led to the arrest of much of the gang in May 1977 and, in February 1979, they were imprisoned for long periods. Confessions of gang members had named Murphy as the leader but statements incriminating him were later retracted. He was questioned once again about the Butcher murders but denied involvement. The total of sentences handed down to the gang at Belfast Crown Court was the longest in legal history in the UK. Last months on the Shankill On completing his sentence for the firearms charge, Lenny Murphy walked out of the Maze Prison on Friday, 16 July 1982. During his term inside, his wife Margaret had initiated divorce proceedings which were being finalised at the time of his death. Murphy returned to his old ways, killing at least four more people over the next four months. He beat to death a partially disabled man one day after returning to the Shankill. Another victim sold him a car and was shot dead after demanding full payment.Dillon, p. 291 Murphy also attempted to extort money from local businessmen who had been sympathetic in the past; however, this encroached on other loyalist paramilitaries with established protection rackets. In late August 1982, Murphy killed a part-time Ulster Defence Regiment soldier from the lower Shankill area who was closely involved with the UVF in Ballymena and was allegedly an informer. The man's body was not discovered for almost a year.McKittrick et al. Lost Lives, p. 912\\"Murdered Man was not the Shankill Butcher, says mother\\", News Letter, 18 November 1982. In mid-October, Murphy and several associates kidnapped a Catholic man who was then tortured and beaten to death in Murphy's own house (temporarily vacated due to renovations). Murphy, who had left the house strewn with the victim's blood and teeth, was arrested for questioning the next morning but later released. The sadism of the widely publicised killing led to loyalism receiving a great deal of bad publicity, and leading UVF figures concluded that Murphy's horrific methods had made him too much of a liability. Death On 16 November 1982, Murphy had just pulled up outside the rear of his girlfriend's house on the Forthriver Road area of Glencairn, a part of the Greater Shankill Area, when two Provisional IRA gunmen emerged from a black van nearby and opened fire with an assault rifle and a 9 mm pistol. Murphy was hit by more than twenty rounds and died instantly.McKittrick, David & McVea, David (2002). Making Sense of the Troubles: the story of the conflict in Northern Ireland. New Amsterdam Books. p. 149 He was gunned down just around the corner from where the bodies of many of the Butchers' victims had been dumped. A few days after his death the IRA claimed responsibility. According to RUC reports, the UVF had provided the IRA hit team with the details of Murphy's habits and movements, which allowed them to assassinate him at that particular location. Another line of inquiry ends at UDA leader James Craig,Dillon, p. 263 who saw Murphy as a serious threat to his widespread racketeering and provided the IRA with key information on Murphy's movements. Craig was known to meet IRA commanders to discuss their racketeering activities ‚Äì he was later killed by his comrades for \\"treason\\".Dillon, pp 312‚Äì16 Murphy was given a large paramilitary funeral by the UVF with a guard of honour wearing the UVF uniform and balaclavas. A volley of three shots was fired over his coffin as it was brought out of his house and a piper played \\"Abide With Me\\". He was buried in Carnmoney Cemetery; on his tombstone the following words were inscribed: \\"Here Lies a Soldier\\".Moloney, Ed (2010). Voices From the Grave: Two men's war in Ireland. Faber & Faber. pp. 381‚Äì82 The tombstone was smashed in 1989.McKittrick et al. Lost Lives, p. 924 His photograph was displayed inside \\"The Eagle\\", the UVF Brigade Staff's headquarters over a chip shop in the Shankill Road.

Wijeweera led the party in two unsuccessful insurrections in Sri Lanka, in 1971 and 1987 to 1989. Early life Wijeweera was born on 14 July 1943 (Bastille Day) to Patabendi Don Andris Wijeweera and Nasi Nona Wickramakalutota who lived in Kottegoda, a coastal fishing village situated close to Matara in southern Sri Lanka and belonged to the Karava caste hierarchy. The eldest in the family, he had a younger brother Ananda and a younger sister Chitranie. His father who ran a small business, was an active member of Ceylon Communist Party (pro- Soviet wing) and very close to Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe. He was disabled after an attack by thugs believed to be members of an opposing political party during the 1947 Parliamentary election campaign for the Hakmana electorate candidate Premalal Kumarasiri. Don Andris Wijeweera died in 1965. Education Wijeweera had his primary education at Goda Uda Government School in Kottegoda from 1947 to 1953. In 1954 he entered Goda Uda Government Senior School to obtain the secondary education and was there until mid-1959. He entered Ambalangoda Dharmashoka College in July 1959 to study GCE Ordinary Level in the science stream. Although he passed the exam, gaining credit grades for some subjects, he was not able to constitute future studies due to limited family finances. Having become active in the communist party, he applied and gained a scholarship to attend the Lumumba University to study medicine and in September 1960 he went to the Soviet Union. He completed the Russian language examination within seven and a half months, obtaining a distinction, and spent his holidays travelling through the USSR. He also worked during this time as an agricultural worker in the Moldavian Republic. He worked through his medical studies well up to third year and also obtained a distinction in political economics in 1963. In late 1963 he became ill and received medical treatment from a hospital in Moscow, but finally requested a full academic term of medical leave and returned to Ceylon. At that time the Communist Party of Ceylon was divided into two groups which were pro-Chinese and pro-Soviet. A vocal supporter of the pro-Chinese wing Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist), he did not get visa to return to the USSR as he joined the pro-Chinese group. Political career Wijeweera became a functionary of the Ceylon Communist Party pro-Chinese group Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist). He could have had plans of gaining power of the party and then launching a revolution, perhaps with the backing of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. During the days of Chairman Mao, whoever controlled the Peking Wing in Ceylon could have been able to convince the Chinese communists to support them in a revolution. =New Left Movement= Soon he was at odds with party leaders and impatient with their lack of revolutionary purpose and formed his own movement on 14 May 1965 after a discussion held in a house at Akmeemana in the Galle district with like minded youth. Initially identified simply as the New Left, this group drew on students and unemployed youths from rural areas, most of them in the 16 to 25-year-old range who felt that their economic interests had been neglected by the nation's leftist coalitions. It became known as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna or JVP, a Marxist political party. After forming the political movement JVP, Wijeweera conducted a series of political lectures for the purpose of educating the people according to their political doctrine. These lectures popularly known as JVP five classes, is one of the key factor in their political agenda. *Crisis of the capitalist system in Sri Lanka *The history of the left movement in Sri Lanka *The history of the socialist revolutions *Indian expansionism *The path of revolution in Sri Lanka Capturing the state power for the purpose of implementing the JVP's socio- economic policies in the country, was another key factor of Wijeweera's political agenda. Period of the late 1960s Wijeweera and the JVP believed that the armed struggle is the most suitable way to capture the state power. =1971 Insurrection and prison= In 1970 while campaigning for the United Front of Sirimavo Bandaranaike in the general election, Wijeweera was arrested, but released shortly. Bandaranaike's United Front won the elections. In April 1971 JVP led armed campaign known as the 1971 April Uprising a failed attempt to overthrow the Dominion of Ceylon under the government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, happened according to the Wijeweera-led JVP's political agenda. Wijeweera was arrested before the armed attack took place in April 1971, and an attempt by students release him from prison failed. He was later tried by the Criminal Justice Commission that was formed after the failed insurrection under the charges of aiding and abetting to overthrow Her Majesty's Government of Ceylon. The commission sentenced him to life imprisonment after which he made an historic speech, stating \\"we may be killed but our voice will never die\\" echoing \\"History Will Absolve Me\\" by Fidel Castro, at the end of Moncada Barracks trial in 1953. On appeal the sentence was reduce to 20 years rigorous imprisonment After the victory of the United National Party in the 1977 elections, however, the new government attempted to broaden its mandate with a period of political tolerance. Wijeweera was freed. =Presidential elections= After the ban on the party was lifted, the JVP entered the arena of legal political competition. As a candidate in the 1982 presidential elections, Wijeweera finished third, with more than 250,000 votes (4%, as compared with Jayewardene's 3.2 million). =1987‚Äì1989 Insurrection= In 1987, the JVP launched a second insurrection. Unlike in 1971, this was not an open revolt, but a low intensity conflict with subversion, assassinations, raids and attacks on military and civilian targets. In October 1989, following the arrest and interrogation of two leading JVP members, Wijeweera was arrested, having been living on a tea estate in Ulapane, masquerading as a planter under the name of Attanayake.  Death  On 13 November 1989 Wijeweera was shot dead, but the actual circumstances remain a subject of speculation. Several versions of his death were circulated following the incident. The Sri Lankan Army stated that he had been shot in a confrontation between members of the JVP and the Army when he was taken by the Army under custody to help look at a JVP safe house. A rumour circulated that he was taken to a cemetery, shot in the leg and then summarily executed by being burnt alive in the crematorium. The official line from Minister of State Defence Ranjan Wijeratne's press brief was that Wijeweera and a fellow JVP member H.B. Herath had been taken to the safe house to help the Army locate part of the JVP's \\"treasure\\", while the search was in progress Herath had pulled out a gun and shot Wijeweera dead. It is widely believed that the Army, at the behest of the Government, were responsible for his death, that it was politically motivated assassination. Indeed, the Government itself gave conflicting answers, Foreign Minister A. C. S. Hameed corroborated Defence Minister Wijeratne's account that Herath had shot at Wijeweera, but states that the Army subsequently opened fire upon the two, killing both. The closest account of events leading up to Wijeweera's death surfaces from Major-General Sarath Munasinghe who recounts the situation in his book A Soldier's Version: > \\"The time was 11.30pm. We reached the premises of HQ 'Operation Combine'. > There were many officers of other services too. We were conducted to the > conference table where Rohana Wijeweera was seated. I was given a chair just > opposite Wijeweera across the table. I commenced having a conversation with > him.

I spoke to Rohana Wijeweera at length. > Whenever I questioned him in English, he answered in Sinhalese. In fact, he > asked me whether I knew the Russian language. I replied in the negative. > Rohana Wijeweera told me that his second language was Russian. He told me > all about his personal life, initially at Bandarawela and later at Ulapane > in Kandy.

After his death in 1989, his widow and children handed themselves over to the Army Headquarters and the government assured protection for the family. They were housed at the staff quarters in SLN Dockyard in Trincomalee and was later in 1992 were moved to staff quarters in the naval barracks at SLNS Gemunu in Welisara where they have lived under state patronage. In February 2015, the Security Council decided that there was no security threat and requested the family to vacate the naval quarters that they were occupying. In popular media The biographical film of Wijeweera's late life titled Ginnen Upan Seethala was made in 2019. The film was directed by Anurudha Jayasinghe and popular actor Kamal Addararachchi played Wijeweera's role.

It was the most popular box office film of 1954 in Great Britain. Its success spawned six sequels, and also a television and radio series entitled Doctor in the House. It made Dirk Bogarde one of the biggest British stars of the 1950s. Other well-known British actors featured in the film were Kenneth More, Donald Sinden and Donald Houston. James Robertson Justice appeared as the irascible chief surgeon Sir Lancelot Spratt, a role he would repeat in many of the sequels. Plot summary The story follows the fortunes of Simon Sparrow (Dirk Bogarde), starting as a new medical student at the fictional St Swithin's Hospital in London. His five years of student life, involving drinking, dating women, and falling foul of the rigid hospital authorities, provide many humorous incidents. When he has to leave his first choice of lodgings to get away from his landlady's amorous daughter (Shirley Eaton), he ends up with three amiable but less-than-shining fellow students as flatmates: * Richard Grimsdyke (Kenneth More). A relative had left him a small but adequate annuity while he remains in medical school, so he sees to it that he flunks each year. * Tony Benskin (Donald Sinden), an inveterate woman chaser. * Taffy Evans (Donald Houston), a rugby fanatic. Towering over them all is the short-tempered, demanding chief surgeon, Sir Lancelot Spratt (played by James Robertson Justice in a manner quite unlike Gordon's original literary character), who strikes terror into everyone. Simon's friends cajole him into a series of disastrous dates, first with a placidly uninterested \\"Rigor Mortis\\" (Joan Sims), then with Isobel (Kay Kendall), a woman with very expensive tastes, and finally with Joy (Muriel Pavlow), a nurse at St Swithin's. After a rocky start, he finds he likes Joy a great deal. Meanwhile, Richard is given an ultimatum by his fianc√©e Stella (Suzanne Cloutier) ‚Äì graduate or she will leave him. He buckles down. The climax of the film is a rugby match with a rival medical school during Simon's fifth and final year. After St Swithin's wins, the other side tries to steal the school mascot, a stuffed gorilla, resulting in a riot and car chase through the streets of London. Simon and his friends are almost expelled for their part in this by the humourless Dean of St Swithin's (Geoffrey Keen). When Simon helps Joy sneak into the nurses' residence after curfew, he accidentally falls through a skylight. This second incident gets him expelled, even though he is a short time away from completing his finals. Sir Lancelot, however, has fond memories of his own student days, particularly of the Dean's own youthful indiscretion (persuading a nurse to reenact Lady Godiva's ride). His discreet blackmail gets Simon reinstated. In the end, Richard fails (as does Tony), but Stella decides to enroll at St Swithin's herself so there will be at least one doctor in the family. Simon and Taffy graduate.

The film rights had been optioned to Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) but they decided not to make the movie, and Box bought the rights. She and Ralph Thomas had a job convincing the Rank Organisation to make the movie because of the lack of a central story. But Box said \\"I think I know how to do it. I take my four students through three or four years of medical training and make that the story.\\" She later said she was \\"very lucky\\" to get Nicholas Phipps to write the script. \\"There wasn't a great deal of the book in it, except for the characters\\", she said. \\"I'd never made comedies before but I reckoned I wanted to make it both real and funny and so I wouldn't deal with comedians.\\"Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-century Cinema by Wheeler W. Dixon, SIU Press, 2001 p109 Rank executives thought that people would not be interested in a film about medicine, and that Bogarde, who up to then had played spivs and Second World War heroes, lacked sex appeal and could not play light comedy. As a result, the filmmakers got a low budget and were only allowed to use available Rank contract artists. \\"They didn't really have any funny actors to work with; they were all straight actors. Dirk Bogarde... had never played a funny line in his life\\", said Thomas. \\"Not one of them every did anything because they wanted to make it funny\\", Thomas added. \\"They played it within a very strict, tight limit of believability. Dirk was able to do that, he got away with it and it stopped him from being just another bright, good looking leading man and made him a star.\\"Brian McFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema 1997 p 557 St Swithin's Hospital is represented by the front of University College London, and is thought to be based upon Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, the medical school attached to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where Richard Gordon was a student. Kenneth More had just made Genevieve (1953) when he signed to appear in the cast, but Genevieve had not been released yet. Accordingly, his fee was only ¬£3,500.Kenneth More, More or Less, Hodder & Staughton, 1978 p 160 Robert Morley was approached to play the surgeon but his agent insisted on a fee of ¬£15,000 so they cast James Robertson Justice instead at a fee of ¬£1,500. Filming started in September 1953. Reception The film was a massive success at the box office. Betty Box estimated it recouped its budget in the first six weeks of release. Thomas says it paid for itself in two weeks and claims it was the first \\"purely British picture without any foreign involvement to make a million pounds' profit within two years.\\" It became the most successful film in Rank's history and had admissions of 15,500,000 ‚Äì one third of the British population. Thomas put its success down to the fact that \\"it was about something which, until that time, had been treated with about as much reverence as you would treat your confessor. People used to hold medicine in great awe... In our film, people liked and identified with the funny situations they had seen happen or which had happened to themselves as patients, doctors or nurses.\\" =Critical= Variety noted \\"A topdraw British comedy...bright, diverting entertainment, intelligently scripted...and warmly played\\"; while TV Guide wrote \\"Shot with the appropriate lighthearted touch in bright, shiny color, with fine performances all around (Kenneth More is particularly good), this sometimes hilarious film started the series off on a high note.\\" Awards * Kenneth More won the 1955 BAFTA Film Award for Best British Actor * Nominated for the 1955 BAFTA Film Award, Best British Film * Nominated for the 1955 BAFTA Film Award, Best Film from any Source * Nicholas Phipps was nominated for the 1955 BAFTA Film Award, Best British Screenplay Sequels Doctor in the House was the most popular film at the British box office in 1954. Its success resulted in six sequels, three starring Bogarde, one with Michael Craig and Leslie Phillips, and the other two with Phillips, as well as a successful television series from London Weekend Television.

She was the daughter of cartoonist and writer George du Maurier and his wife Emma Wightwick, the elder sister to actor Gerald du Maurier, the aunt of novelists Angela and Daphne du Maurier, and a great- granddaughter of Mary Anne Clarke, royal mistress of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. She met the young barrister Arthur Llewelyn Davies at a dinner party in 1889 and they became engaged shortly thereafter.Birkin, Andrew, J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys. She married him in 1892, and they had five children, all boys: George (1893‚Äì1915), Jack (1894‚Äì1959), Peter (1897‚Äì1960), Michael (1900‚Äì1921), and Nicholas (Nico) (1903‚Äì1980). In 1898, Davies met Barrie at a dinner party, discovering he was already friends with her three sons from their regular visits to Kensington Gardens. She and Barrie became close (he called her by her middle name \\"Jocelyn\\"), with him spending considerable time at the Davies's home, and the family accompanying Barrie and his wife on holidays. She encouraged her boys' friendship with him. Her husband died in 1907 of a sarcoma in his cheek. She welcomed Barrie's financial and emotional support, both for herself and for her boys. Following Barrie's divorce in 1909, he and Sylvia remained close, but did not marry. She became ill with an inoperable cancer in her chest, and died in 1910. Shortly before her death, she wrote that she wanted her boys' nurse Mary Hodgson to continue caring for them, and that she knew Barrie would continue providing for them, which he did. She named him, along with her mother Emma du Maurier, her brother Guy du Maurier, and Arthur's brother Crompton Llewelyn Davies as their guardians. Barrie told the boys after her death that she had been engaged to him, but Jack and Peter later expressed scepticism of this report.

Wagoner resigned as chairman and CEO at General Motors on March 29, 2009, at the request of the White House. The latter part of Wagoner's tenure as CEO of General Motors found him under heavy criticism as the market valuation of GM went down by more than 90% and the company lost more than US$82 billion. This led to him being named one of the worst CEOs of 2008. He is a board member of ChargePoint, an electric vehicle infrastructure company. Family and education Wagoner was born in Wilmington, Delaware and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. He graduated from John Randolph Tucker High School there, where he was named \\"Best All Around\\" student in his graduating class. He received a BA in Economics from Duke University in 1975. He then attended Harvard Business School, from which he received an MBA in 1977. He is married and has three adult sons. While at Duke, he became a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Wagoner is a member of the boards of trustees of Duke University, Detroit Country Day School, the Board of Dean's Advisors of the Harvard Business School, and the board of directors of Catalyst. He is a member of The Business Council, The Business Roundtable, Detroit Renaissance Executive Committee, and the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board. General Motors After Harvard, he joined GM as an analyst in the treasurer's office. In 1981, he became treasurer of GM's Brazil subsidiary and later served as managing director. In 1992, he was named GM's chief financial officer, in 1994 he became executive vice president and/or president of North American Operations, and in 1998 he was named president and chief operating officer. After GM lost $30 billion during a single three-year stretch in the early 1990s, Wagoner and chairman John F. \\"Jack\\" Smith Jr. forced GM \\"back to basics\\" to battle \\"30 years of management mistakes\\" that left him with little room to maneuver. =Chief Executive Officer= Wagoner with President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Ford CEO Alan Mulally, and Chrysler CEO Tom LaSorda in 2006 Wagoner became president and chief executive officer in June 2000 and was elected chairman on May 1, 2003. Under his leadership, GM suffered more than $85 billion in losses. In an interview,\\"Interview With Rick Wagoner,\\" Motor Trend magazine, June 2006, p. 94Canadian Driver, Canadian Driver , June 28, 2006 Wagoner stated that the worst decision of his tenure at GM was \\"axing the EV1 electric car program and not putting the right resources into hybrids. \\"It didn't affect profitability,\\" Wagoner claimed, \\"but it did affect image\\". In April 2005 Wagoner took back personal control of GM's North American car division from GM North American chairman Bob Lutz and GM North American President Gary Cowger in light of its poor performance. In early June 2005 Wagoner announced that GM in the United States would close several plants and shed 25,000 employees (17% of GM's U.S. workforce) by 2008. The cuts will result in GM production reducing output by one million cars and trucks (from 6 million to 5 million). In the Automotive industry crisis of 2008‚Äì10, Wagoner came under renewed pressure as GM sought financial support from the U.S. government in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy. During the latter half of 2008, Wagoner and GM maintained that bankruptcy was \\"not an option that GM is considering,\\" despite rapidly running out of capital.More Cuts Expected at General Motors, \\"New York Times\\", July 15, 2008. Retrieved 25 April 2010. This stance was called \\"presumptuous\\" by some observers.In Defense of GM's Rick Wagoner, HuffPost, December 8, 2008. Retrieved 25 April 2010. Within 9 months, GM was to declare bankruptcy. During hearings for government loans to the Big Three Automakers, Wagoner, Alan Mulally and Robert Nardelli were criticized for flying to Washington, D.C. in corporate jets. For a subsequent meeting, the three CEOs drove from Detroit to Washington by hybrid cars.Ford's PR campaign: CEO Alan Mulally drives to hearings (no corporate jet), promises $1 salary, Daily News (New York), December 2, 2008. Retrieved 4 December 2008. The BBC reported that Wagoner was popular among GM employees and reporters. However, it cites that he lacked the \\"ruthless streak needed to make the tough decisions required to bring GM back from the brink of bankruptcy.\\" While analysts have praised Wagoner for operational improvements, cost-cutting moves and an increased focus on vehicle quality, with the appointment of Bob Lutz to oversee product execution, others criticized him for his incremental approach to change, largely as he resisted making the drastic cuts demanded by that of the market and US government. Throughout the first months of 2009, Wagoner argued that a bankruptcy would be more costly than a government bailout. However, there remained lingering doubts that he was implementing the restructuring moves necessary to remain viable in the future without further government loans. On March 29, 2009, Wagoner agreed to immediately resign his position as GM chairman and CEO, as part of the Obama administration deal to provide GM with further short-term financing. The following day, the US government rejected GM's initial restructuring plan and gave the company 60 days to come with a new proposal or be forced into bankruptcy. He was replaced as CEO by Fritz Henderson, who had been serving as GM's President and chief operating officer. After 32 years at GM, Wagoner retired with an exit package of over $10 million: $1.65 million in benefits per year for his first five years of retirement, $74,030 per year pension for the rest of his life, and a $2.6 million life insurance policy that can be cashed out at any time.Rick Wagoner Gets Over $10 Million, \\"Huffington Post\\", August 14, 2009. In 2017, Wagoner was appointed a director at ChargePoint Inc., a Silicon Valley company that makes electric-vehicle charging stations. in 2018, Wagoner made an investment into YourMechanic, a Silicon Valley startup which connects owners with a group of certified mechanics, currently offering more than 800 repair services.

When the progressive jackpot is won, the jackpot for the next play is reset to a predetermined value, and resumes increasing under the same rule. Many slot machines and video poker machines feature a progressive jackpot. The jackpot increases by a small predetermined amount each time the game is played. Often multiple machines are pooled or linked together to form a larger progressive jackpot which grows more quickly because more non-winning plays can be counted toward it. Many lotteries feature progressive jackpots. After each drawing in which the jackpot is not won, a large amount of money is \\"carried forward\\" to the jackpot for next drawing. Progressive jackpot meter The amount of the jackpot increases by a small amount for every play on any connected machine. The amount by which the jackpot advances is set by the casino (\\"the house\\"). A machine offering a progressive jackpot usually displays the amount of the jackpot, rather boldly, to attract players. After a player wins the jackpot, the jackpot resets to a preset minimum level. For example, on a machine whose house edge is 5%, a generous jackpot contribution might be 1% (one fifth of the expected profit). The house is prepared to contribute some of the profit of a jackpot linked machine because players are attracted by the: *relative novelty of progressive jackpots (generally, only a small fraction of the house's gaming machines will be connected to a progressive jackpot) *constantly changing meter, often displayed on large LCD or LED displays *large amount of the jackpot, which eventually motivates more players to play the game. Qualifying Usually the progressive jackpot is only offered to players who wager the maximum number of credits per play. All wagers, whether or not they are maximum-credit bets, contribute to the jackpot. As a result, a game which requires a 10-credit wager to qualify for the progressive jackpot tends to have its progressive jackpot rise to higher levels (relative to its break-even level) than a game that requires only a 5-credit wager to qualify. Usually the jackpot can only be won by winning the combination with the highest payoff, e.g. a royal flush at a video poker game, or five of the most valuable symbols (lemons, cherries, alligators, etc.) on a slot machine. Often, the displayed amount of such jackpots includes a base payout which is often simply the regular payout for the winning combination multiplied by the minimum qualifying bet. If the jackpot is \\"reset\\" to this amount each time it is won then in essence the house is not providing any \\"seed money\\" for the jackpot since the minimum that can be won in such a case would simply be the amount the player would normally be awarded for the jackpot-winning combination. \\"Mystery\\" or \\"must-hit-by\\" jackpots A variation of the standard progressive jackpot is the \\"must-hit-by\\" jackpot, which has substantial differences compared to traditional jackpots. The value of every \\"must-hit-by\\" jackpot is determined immediately after the preceding jackpot is won by a random number generator and stored within an encrypted computer connected to a gaming machine (or, more commonly, a network of machines) and is publicly disclosed to be within a certain range (for example, a small jackpot might be programmed to pay out at between $1,000 and $3,000). The jackpot pays on the wager that causes the jackpot to reach or exceed the threshold, with the maximum value within this range being the \\"must-hit-by\\" amount. Often such jackpots encompass a variety of games, with each game contributing a small percentage of wagers to the jackpot. Thus, these jackpots are often billed as \\"mystery jackpots\\" since the conditions that cause them to be paid do not depend on achieving any specific result in the main game. Furthermore, it is not usually necessary to bet the maximum amount possible (or, often, to even bet any minimal amount above the minimum wager allowed by the software) in order to win a \\"mystery jackpot\\" - although since it is a percentage of each wager that goes into the jackpot the odds of winning on a particular spin are usually in proportion to the amount of the bet. Or, to put it another way, one spin for twenty dollars would have the same odds of winning the mystery jackpot as twenty spins for one dollar each would, and also the same odds of winning the jackpot as would four hundred spins for five cents each. Often, such games have several \\"mystery jackpots\\" that usually differ by at least an order of magnitude both in terms of magnitude and frequency of payout, which can ensure that jackpots are seen to be won frequently (often, many times per day in the case of relatively small jackpots). One variation of this scheme (most often used by gaming corporations serving brick-and-mortar establishments over a large geographic footprint) is to have one main jackpot, several intermediate jackpots paid at the regional level, smaller jackpots paid at the site level and/or the smallest jackpots tied to each individual machine. From the house perspective, a key financial consideration of such jackpots is that the portion of players' wagers directed to the jackpot are, in essence, only funding the portion of the jackpot within its specified \\"range.\\" The gaming operator needs to fund each jackpot's minimum amount from the house edge of the main game, which is usually at least a third of the \\"must-hit-by\\" amount especially in games with multiple jackpots as this creates an assurance that each jackpot will always be several times the value of the jackpot \\"below\\" it. If the random number generator gives each value within the jackpot \\"range\\" an equal chance of being the \\"winning\\" value then under these conditions \\"seed money\\" from the house would likely account for over half of the jackpot's total funding, for which the house would presumably need to compensate by increasing the house edge of the main game. To counteract this issue and increase the average amount wagered before each jackpot is won, the mathematical formula used to calculate each jackpot is often skewed in such a way that makes it likely the actual average and median jackpots will be well above the average of the published minimum and maximum values. A simple example formula that would achieve this (expanding on the aforementioned example) would be simply to calculate the jackpot as being $1,000 plus the square root of a random number between zero and four million, which would result in a 75% probability of each jackpot being between $2,000 and $3,000 and a 25% probability of a jackpot being between $1,000 and $2,000. Break-even point In some games such as video poker, blackjack, or Caribbean stud poker, it is possible to compute an optimal playing strategy based on the average payoff (the amount of payoff times the chance of payoff). Because the jackpot of a progressive game constantly grows, it sometimes exceeds the break-even point for players, such that the jackpot wager becomes a \\"positive expectation bet\\" for the player, with an average return to player (RTP) of greater than 100%. When the progressive jackpot is less than the break-even point, there is a negative expected value (house edge) for all players. In the long run, with optimal strategy, a player can profit by only playing progressive games when their jackpots are above the break-even point, although the \\"long run\\" can be quite long, tens of thousands of plays. The break-even point cannot be easily calculated on a slot machine game, because the payback percentage for the game is normally unknown to the player. The break-even point in poker-based games can be calculated because the payback percentage for the game is a function of the paybacks and odds of the poker hands, which is based on a standard 52-card deck. The return of a slot machine is based on the published paytable, but also on the normally unpublished reels. For a five-reel slot machine, the player would need to know each symbol on each of the slot machine's five reels in order to calculate the odds. For a three-reel slot, the reels are normally weighted, and this would not be possible. However, in some circumstances the manufacturer may publish the payout of their machines. Many online casinos allow the same game to be played in multiple currencies, in which case the break-even point and average return to player can change depending on the player's currency choice. This is because the jackpot amount may be converted between currencies so that the same amount is paid out to the winner no matter their currency choice, but the wager required to qualify for the jackpot is not. For example, consider a game that pays a $1000 / ‚Ç¨900 / ¬£700 jackpot, but requires a fixed $1 / ‚Ç¨1 / ¬£1 wager to qualify for the jackpot. In such cases, it is beneficial for the player to play in dollars, as the qualifying wager is a smaller proportion of the jackpot. Thus the break-even point will always be lower and the return to player will always be higher while betting dollars. Advantage play Advantage players, who only play when the progressive jackpot provides them with a positive expectation situation, still generate revenue for the casino. Even though the player has an advantage over the house, the casino still profits from each play, because the bulk of the progressive jackpot has been pre-paid by the prior non-winning players. Advantage gamblers sometimes organize teams of players to play machines where the progressive jackpots generate a positive expectation situation. Such teams often displace ordinary players, making the machines unavailable just when they are the most attractive to gamblers generally. Team members often have cell phones and work in shifts, calling a teammate to replace them when they're ready for a break. Some casinos have a policy of \\"no team play\\", and will eject players suspected of playing on such teams. Such tactics do not work at online casinos because there are effectively an unlimited number of duplicate machines for players to play at, so the game cannot be monopolised by one player or small group. Player's clubs Most casinos offer slot clubs, which pay back a percentage of a gambler's wagers on their games in the form of cash rebates or other perks with a monetary value. Participating in a slot club can reduce the break-even point of a progressive jackpot game because of the value of the rebate on each wager. Other jackpot games Progressive jackpots are not limited to slot machines and video poker. Poker games sometimes include a progressive bad beat jackpot. Caribbean stud poker is another casino game which often has a progressive jackpot available, and some online casinos offer progressive versions of blackjack, roulette, and other casino games. Many lotteries feature progressive jackpots. Progressive blackjack A progressive blackjack game usually does not differ from conventional blackjack, apart from the addition of an optional side bet which gives the player a chance to win a progressive jackpot. The side bet wins if the player is dealt one of several specific card combinations such as four suited aces. The awards can range from several dollars up to 100% of the jackpot depending on the different card combinations, and the winning hand paytable can differ between casinos.  Progressive jackpot records  Developers of progressive jackpot machines have been competing for the highest prizes since their inception. Microgaming, an online casino services providers, host a jackpot system which is cross-product, where multiple games contribute to the pool. On the 28th of September 2018, a record jackpot was won on their game Mega Moolah totalling ‚Ç¨18,915,872, which exceeded the previous record by approximately 10%. The previous record win had been held for over five and a half years by another progressive jackpot game called Mega Fortune, which is developed by casino software provider NetEnt. The total win on that occasion was ‚Ç¨17,861,800. Interestingly, this is the third time that the world record has changed hands between these two games since 2011.  In- House Jackpots  The In-House or Proprietary Progressive slot machines are the group of devices or programs that are linked together. These machines and applications are owned as well as operated by the land-based casino or its online variant. The progressive jackpots on these slot machines are not multi- million-dollar, but the winning prize is considered a substantial win. The In- House or Proprietary Progressive machines are most often hit compared to wide- area progressive jackpots.

Built for the 1967 World's Fair Expo 67 at a cost of around CAD$18 million, the trains carried 1,000 passengers each and ran approximately every five minutes. In 1968 the cars were sold to the City of Montreal for $1.8 million and operated by the Montreal Transit Commission (now the STM). The train remained in service for five more years for Man and His World (summer only); however, from 1969 onward, they ran on a shortened route when the terminus was cut back to Saint Helen's Island. After the 1972 season the service was withdrawn. Vehicles Interior of Expo Express train looking toward front Interior of Expo Express train looking toward rear of car Not to be confused with the Minirail monorail which ran within the perimeters of the Expo Site, the Expo Express used standard railway technology, with two running rails and a third electrified rail identical to those of the Toronto subway. In fact, the trains used were a modified version of the Hawker Siddeley H-series used by the Toronto Transit Commission with one fewer door on each side, and streamlined ends. Consequently, unlike the Montreal Metro with rubber tires, the Expo Express used traditional steel-wheeled trains. The Expo Express also featured fully air-conditioned passenger cars, whereas the Metro does not have any air-conditioned trains on its first four lines due in part to the small sizes of the tunnels and the possibility of heating them to a temperature that is unsuitable for operation. The R√©seau express m√©tropolitain (which will operate steel-wheeled trains) will be the first metro line in Montreal to have air-conditioned trains once it opens in 2022. In 1968, the New York City Transit Authority looked into the feasibility of modifying the cars for use on the Staten Island Railway, but this plan never came to fruition. Background The Expo Express was the first fully-automated rapid transit system in North America, utilizing an Automatic Train Operation (ATO) system based on audio frequency track circuits furnished by the Union Switch & Signal division of Westinghouse Air Brake Company. This fact, however, was not widely publicized during the fair, as it was felt the public would not readily board a train controlled entirely by a computer. Operators from Montreal's transit union were placed in cabs at the front and given mundane tasks such as opening and closing the doors of the train to reduce boredom. This resulted in a minor incident during the fair, at La Ronde station. The conductor had pressed the button to close the doors and proceed, but his train had already sensed an oncoming express from Notre Dame Island and automatically delayed the go command to let it roll in. In the meantime, the driver realized he had forgotten his lunch. However, he could not exit through the passenger doors because his train was in a \\"wait\\" state and would not allow the doors to open. Instead, he crawled through the small cab window. By the time he had fetched his lunch, however, the oncoming train had pulled in and his train had taken off on its own. It crossed the bridge over the Le Moyne Channel, proceeded along the seaway, and came to a smooth stop at Notre Dame Island station where an Expo official was waiting. This person crawled back through the cab window and pressed the button to open the doors and let the passengers disembark. Route Model board at Expo Express control centre at Place d' Accueil terminal showing line layout Control console at Expo Express control centre at Place d' Accueil terminal The line was double-track throughout, except for a single-track section at Cit√© du Havre, where people exited on one side of the train and boarded on the other. Maintenance facilities were located northwest of La Ronde station. When the Cite du Havre line closed in late 1968, and the terminus was cut back to Saint Helen's Island, it was single-tracked as well. The following year the former Habitat station (outbound only; closed in early 1967 due to low use) was physically relocated to Notre Dame Island, near the Man and Agriculture pavilion, and renamed Notre-Dame East station (inbound only). In 1972 all stations on Notre Dame Island closed, making the route direct from Saint Helen's to La Ronde with no stops in between. The line was dismantled north of Notre Dame Island in 1974 for the construction of the Olympic basin; rolling stock was moved to the Concorde bridge between Notre Dame and Saint Helen's Island and stored there until 1979. History The Expo Express ran from April 1967 to October 1972 (one year after the section of Man and his World on Notre Dame Island section closed to the public). After Expo, when service continued during the early days of Man and His World, the Express only ran for two months each year. After service was discontinued, in 1973 the trains were put in storage on the Concorde Bridge between Saint Helen's and Notre Dame Islands. The north end of the line was demolished in 1974. In the summer of 1979 the trains were moved again, to the Port of Montreal via a temporary track, and stored at the nearby CN Point St-Charles Shops. After several unrealized schemes including a reported sale to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the cars were moved from Point St- Charles to an outdoor field storage facility in Les C√®dres in the mid/late 1980s, and were scrapped in 1995. Virtually nothing remains of the Expo Express. The only evidence is at La Ronde, where a train bridge deteriorates in the river and remnants of the La Ronde station have been converted into the main park entrance. The area where Place d'Accueil stood is now a parking lot, and part of the track route is a paved bicycle path.

In 1547, De Jode was admitted to the Guild of St. Luke, and began his work as a publisher. He frequently printed the works of other cartographers, including Giacomo Gastaldi's world map in 1555, Jacob van Deventer's map of the Duchy of Brabant in 1558, and Ortelius' eight-sheet world map in 1564.  Background  His most outstanding work is a two volume atlas Speculum Orbis Terrarum published in 1578. It was aimed at competing with another atlas, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum by Ortelius, published eight years earlier in 1570. The competing atlas had become so popular by the time he finally published his own atlas however, that his version never sold well, despite his outstanding reputation. Only about a dozen examples have survived. De Jode made plans for another enlarged edition, which was uncompleted at his death in 1591. His son Cornelis de Jode took over and published the Speculum Orbis Terrae in 1593. This never sold well either. Scholars consider many of De Jode's maps to be superior to those of Ortelius, both in detail and style. In constructing his world map, Hemispherium Ab √Üquinoctiali Linea, Ad Circulum Poli Antarctici, published in 1593, De Jode was strongly influenced by Guillaume Postel's 1581 polar planisph√®re, Polo aptata Nova Charta Universi.Rodney W.

He also co-starred with Gregory Peck in several adventure movies, notably The Guns of Navarone. Born in south London, he exaggerated his Scottish roots, but was in fact prominent in Scottish public life, helping to launch Scottish Television and serving as Rector of the University of Edinburgh. Biography The son of an Aberdeen-born geologist and named after his father, James Robertson Justice was born James Norval Harald Justice in Lee, a suburb of Lewisham in South London, in 1907. Educated at Marlborough College in Wiltshire, Justice studied science at University College London, but left after a year and became a geology student at the University of Bonn, where he again left after just a year. He spoke many languages (possibly up to 20) including Spanish, French, Greek, Danish, Russian, German, Italian, Dutch and Gaelic.Sheridan Morley, \\"Justice, James Norval Harald Robertson (1907‚Äì1975)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 Nov 2007 =After university= Justice returned to the UK in 1927, and became a journalist with Reuters in London, alongside Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond. After a year, he emigrated to Canada, where he worked as an insurance salesman, taught English at a boys' school, became a lumberjack and mined for gold. He came back to Britain penniless, working his passage on a Dutch freighter washing dishes in the ship's galley to pay his fare. On his return to Britain he served as secretary of the British Ice Hockey Association in the early 1930sMotor Sport, December 1933, Page 57. and managed the national team at the 1932 European Championships in Berlin to a seventh-place finish. He combined his administrative duties in 1931‚Äì32 with a season as goaltender with the London Lions.A to Z Encyclopaedia of Ice Hockey entry. Retrieved 1 November 2007. Justice was entered in a Wolseley Hornet Special in the JCC Thousand Mile Race at Brooklands on 3 and 4 May 1932. The car was unplaced.Motor Sport, July 1932, Pages 415‚Äì419. The following year a \\"J. Justice (J.A.P.

Motor Sport reported in 1963: \\"We remember him at Lewes with a G.N. and in a Relay Race with a Wolseley Hornet.\\"Motor Sport, February 1963, Page 82. Justice left Britain again to become a policeman for the League of Nations in the Territory of the Saar Basin (a region of Germany occupied and governed by France and Germany under a League of Nations mandate originating in the Treaty of Versailles). After the Nazis came to power, he fought in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. It was here that he first grew his signature trademark bushy beard, which he retained throughout his career. On return to Britain, he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, but after sustaining an injury in 1943 (thought to be shrapnel from a German shell), he was pensioned off. =Love of Scotland= He married nurse Dillys Hayden (1914‚Äì1984) in Chelsea in 1941, and they had a son named James. On his return from the war, he reinvented himself with stronger Scottish roots, dispensing with his two middle names and acquiring the new middle name Robertson out of his habit of wearing Robertson tartan. Feeling strongly about his Scottish ancestry, he once claimed to have been born in 1905 under a distillery on the Isle of Skye; many sources listed his birthplace as Wigtown, Wigtownshire, in Dumfries and Galloway. He lived in Wigtown at Orchardton House between 1946 and 1950. He unsuccessfully contested the North Angus and Mearns constituency for the Labour Party in the 1950 general election. With the earnings he made from the film Doctor in the House (1954), Justice bought a cottage in the Scottish Highlands village of Spinningdale. In 1966 Justice appeared as a narrator in five episodes of the BBC children's television series Jackanory telling stories and legends from Scotland, including those of The Battle of the Birds and The Black Bull of Norroway. =Acting career= Justice took up acting after joining the Players' Theatre in London. The club, under the chairmanship of Leonard Sachs who was latterly chairman of BBC's television's The Good Old Days, would stage Victorian music hall nights. Standing in for Sachs one night, he was recommended for the film For Those In Peril (1944). As an actor, with his domineering personality, bulky physique, (he played rugby for Beckenham RFC First XV in the 1924‚Äì25 season alongside Johnnie Cradock who would become the partner of 1950s TV chef Fanny) and rich, booming voice, he was soon established as a major supporting player in British comedy films. His first leading role was as headmaster in the film Vice Versa (1948), written and directed by Peter Ustinov, who cast him partly because he'd been \\"a collaborator of my father's at Reuters.\\" Justice was the demanding surgeon Sir Lancelot Spratt in the \\"Doctor\\" series of films of the 1950s and 1960s, beginning with Doctor in the House (1954), playing a role for which he is possibly best remembered. In his films he was sometimes credited as Seumas M√≤r na Feusag (Scottish Gaelic, translation: Big James with the Beard), James R. Justice, James Robertson or James Robertson-Justice. On 31 August 1957, he helped launch the TV station Scottish Television, hosting the channel's first show, This is Scotland. From 1957 to 1960, and again from 1963 to 1966, he was Rector of the University of Edinburgh. In the war film The Guns of Navarone (1961), Robertson Justice had a co-starring role as well as narrating the story. He appeared in four films with Navarone co-star Gregory Peck, including Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951), and Moby Dick (1956), in which Robertson Justice played the one-armed sea captain also attacked by the white whale. In the film, Robertson Justice's character tries to befriend Captain Ahab (played by Peck), but is amazed and repulsed by Ahab's obsessive pursuit of Moby Dick. =Later life= After a series of affairs and the drowning of his four-year- old son in 1949Hull Daily Mail - Tuesday 21 June 1949 Page 3 Col.3 James Norvil Justice, four-year-old son of James Robertson Justice, Scottish film actor, was found drowned last night in the River Test, near his home at Lower Mill House, Whitchurch, Hampshire. near his watermill home in Whitchurch, Hampshire, Justice separated from his wife; she eventually divorced him in 1968. He met actress Irene von Meyendorff in 1960 on the set of The Ambassador, and they remained together, eventually marrying in 1975 three days before he died. Not long after completing his work for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1968, Justice suffered a severe stroke, which signalled the beginning of the end for his career. He appeared in a number of films afterward, albeit in less prominent roles (i.e. playing his best known character of Sir Lancelot Spratt for the final time in Doctor in Trouble (1970), featured only briefly in several scenes). He suffered a further series of strokes, which left him unable to work. He was declared bankrupt in 1970, and he died penniless in 1975. His ashes were buried in a north Scotland moor near his former residence in the Highland village of Spinningdale. A biography entitled James Robertson Justice‚ÄîWhat's The Bleeding Time? (referring to a joke in the first Doctor film) was published by Tomahawk Press on 3 March 2008. It was written by James Hogg, Robert Sellers and Howard Watson.

In most modern universities, the BD as a first degree is essentially equivalent to a Bachelor of Arts degree with a speciality in divinity. Relatively few institutions award undergraduate Bachelor of Divinity degrees today, and the distinction between institutions that do award such degrees and those that award BA degrees for theological subjects is usually one of bureaucracy rather than curriculum. In the Catholic Universities the Bachelor of Sacred Theology (STB) is often called the Baccalaureate in Divinity (BD) and is treated as a postgraduate qualification. United Kingdom At the University of Cambridge and previously at the University of Oxford, the BD is a postgraduate qualification, and applicants must have already completed an undergraduate degree before becoming a candidate for the degree.University of Cambridge Regulations: Bachelor of Divinity The same principle applied at Oxford where the degree was closed to new registrations in 2005; BDs continue to be awarded to those registered before 2005. Registration for Cambridge's BD is only open to senior graduates of that university.Bachelor of Divinity, University of Cambridge The BD at Cambridge is the highest ranking bachelor's degree, and it is so senior that it outranks the PhD.The Jargon, Queen's College It requires a significant contribution to knowledge in the area of Christian theology, and is awarded based on published work, dissertation, or a combination of both.Bachelor of Divinity Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge The University of Durham BD was of a similar nature, and available to graduates of seven years' standing. It was awarded on the basis of published work of a similar extent to a PhD ‚Äî the usual basis for the award was a book. It is no longer awarded. St Mary's College at the University of St Andrews ‚Äî where the main undergraduate award is the MTheol (Master of Theology) ‚Äî offers the BD following a three-year course of study for graduates in other disciplines. Current examples of when this degree is taught as an undergraduate programme in the United Kingdom are:UCAS - Home the University of St Andrews (where entrants must hold a degree in another discipline); Queen's University Belfast; the University of Aberdeen; the University of Edinburgh; and the University of Glasgow. Heythrop College, a constituent college of the University of London, offers a BD course through the University of London International Programmes.Bachelor of Divinity University of London International Programmes Due to the closure of Heythrop College set for the summer of 2018, as of August 1, 2017, the University of London itself will provide academic direction for the Divinity programme as it will continue to be offered through the International Programme. Ireland In Ireland St. Patrick's College, Maynooth (Pontifical University) offer the Baccalaureate in Divinity (BD) degree to students who already have completed studies in theology or philosophy.Baccalaureate in Divinity (BD) - St. Patrick's College, Maynooth. The Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy and most other Roman Catholic seminaries (Clonliffe College, Thurles, Carlow etc.), would also have awarded the BD degree. Trinity College, Dublin, as it traditionally did for Church of Ireland clergy, offers a Bachelor in Divinity (BD) as a postgraduate degree; it is the highest ranking bachelor's degree and is so senior that it outranks all degrees but doctorates. It requires a significant contribution to knowledge in the area of Christian theology, and is awarded based on the completion of eight examination papers and a 40,000 word thesis within five years.Divinity (B.D.) Trinity College, Dublin. The Presbyterian Union Theological College as part of Queen's University, Belfast also awards the Bachelor of Divinity as an undergraduate qualification.Bachelor of Divinity (BD) Union Theological College. Other countries The Bachelor of Divinity degree offered in the region of South Asia by the affiliated colleges under the Senate of Serampore College is a graduate degree with post-graduate requirement for admission, in the sense that only graduates can register for BD. The university is going through change to adopt a three-year BD course with field-work and expand its accessibility through distance education, this will be considered as the essential degree for ordination in the diasporic Christian churches. Meanwhile, the university have implemented a five-year integrated and research oriented MDiv program with specializations. The same used to apply in New Zealand, where the undergraduate degree is BTheol. Until recently both were offered at the University of Otago. The BD was the older, postgraduate degree and was usually attained by people training for ministry in the Presbyterian Church. BD is no longer offered by the University of Otago. At Moore Theological College in Sydney, Australia, the BD is classified as a post-graduate bachelor's degree in the sense that the normal entry requirement is completion of another bachelor's degree. The BD consists of four years of coursework in theology with an emphasis on biblical studies including original languages. The degree may be awarded with honours depending on grades and successful completion of a research component.http://www.moore.edu.au The BD is the basic qualification for ordination in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. Similar courses of study (often only three years in duration) at comparable institutions in Australia have been reclassified as a Masters in Divinity.

Population The 2000 U.S. census counted 8,631 residents in the 0.49-square-mile neighborhood‚Äîan average of 17,747 people per square mile, one of the highest densities in the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 9,195. The median age for residents was 34, about average for Los Angeles; the percentages of residents aged 19 to 49 and above were among the county's highest. Larchmont was highly diverse ethnically, and the percentage of Asians was comparatively high. The breakdown was Latinos, 37.2%; Asians, 30%; whites, 24.6%; blacks, 3%, and others, 5.3%. Korea (28.3%) and Guatemala (16.8%) were the most common places of birth for the 56% of the residents who were born abroad, a high figure compared to rest of the city. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $47,780, average for Los Angeles, but a high percentage of households had an income of $20,000 or less. The average household size of 2.5 people was average for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 72.9% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment owners 27.1%. The percentages of never-married men and women, 42.1% and 36.9%, respectively, were among the county's highest. Education About thirty-two percent of Larchmont residents aged 25 and older had earned a bachelor's degree, with over 60% percent having a high school education level, an average figure for the city. The schools operating within the Larchmont borders are: \\"Schools,\\" Mapping L.A. * Christ the King School, private, 617 North Arden Boulevard (Opened 1959, TK‚Äì8) * Cheder Menachem, private, Melrose Avenue * Frances Blend Special Education Center, public, 5210 Clinton Street (Opened 1926, merged with Van Ness in 2013) * Van Ness Avenue Elementary School, LAUSD, 501 North Van Ness Avenue A view of Larchmont and a filming setup, 2012 Recreation and parks * Robert Burns Park, 4900 Beverly Boulevard, unstaffed pocket park with a play area and picnic tables.

Birth The first child of the then Duke and Duchess of Brabant, Elisabeth was delivered by Caesarean section at 21:58 CET on 25 October 2001 at the Erasmus Hospital, the teaching hospital of Universit√© libre de Bruxelles in Anderlecht, Brussels. She was baptized on 9 December 2001 in the chapel of Ciergnon Castle in the Belgian Ardennes, by Cardinal Godfried Danneels, the Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels. Her godparents are Archduke Amedeo of Austria-Este (paternal cousin), and Countess H√©l√®ne d'Udekem d'Acoz (maternal aunt). Life and education Princess Elisabeth studied at St John Berchmans College, Brussels in the Marollen district of Brussels, which had been attended by her older cousins, the children of her paternal aunt, the Archduchess of Austria-Este. This is a significant change in the habits of the royal family, as it is the first time that a future Belgian monarch's education has begun in Dutch. Elisabeth speaks Dutch, French, German and English. On 21 July 2013, once her father had taken the oath of office as King of the Belgians (his father, King Albert II, having abdicated shortly before), Princess Elisabeth became heir apparent to the throne and as such bears the title of Duchess of Brabant.Text in French of the 2001 amendment: ¬´ Le titre de Duc de Brabant ou de Duchesse de Brabant sera toujours port√©, √† l'avenir, par le Prince ou la Princesse, fils a√Æn√© ou fille a√Æn√©e du Roi, et, √† d√©faut, par le Prince ou la Princesse, fils a√Æn√© ou fille a√Æn√©e du fils a√Æn√© ou de la fille a√Æn√©e du Roi. ¬ª Elisabeth studied at UWC Atlantic College in Wales and received International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme in the May 2020 session.

Activities  Princess Elisabeth's first public appearance was on 21 July 2006, when she accompanied her parents during a Te Deum for National Day celebrations in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula. A year later, on 13 June 2007, Princess Elisabeth and her parents attended the opening of a new Technopolis youth interactive at Mechelen. In 2009, Princess Elisabeth gave her name to the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Station, a Belgian scientific polar research station. In September 2011, the princess gave her first public speech (in Dutch) at the opening of Princess Elisabeth Children‚Äôs Hospital, part of Ghent University Hospital in Ghent. She gave her first official speech in 2014 amidst World War I commemorations. Princess Elisabeth became godmother of a patrol vessel named Pollux P902 on 6 May 2015 in Zeebrugge. In June 2019, the Duchess of Brabant and her mother traveled to Kenya for the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund, where they visited the Kakuma refugee camp. Princess Elisabeth volunteers to help children with learning difficulties, the elderly, the homeless and people with a handicap. Position Ten years prior to Elisabeth's birth, a new act of succession was put into effect which introduced absolute primogeniture, meaning that Elisabeth comes first in the line of succession because she is the eldest child.

In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features an abundance of milk, curd and whey products. Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa and West Africa each have distinctive dishes, preparation techniques, and consumption mores. Central Africa Madesu beans are a staple in Central Africa Central Africa stretches from the Tibesti Mountains in the north to the vast rainforest basin of the Congo River, the highlands of Kivu and the savana of Katanga. This region has received culinary influence of the Swahilis (a culture that evolved via the combination of Bantu, Yemeni, Omani and Indian cultures) during the East African Slave Trade. Swahili culinary influences can be found in dishes such as: mandanzi, pilaf rice, kachumbari, sambsusa, kuku paka, etc. Central African cuisine has also been influenced by the Portuguese, by way of the Kongo and Ndongo Kingdoms. Salt fish was introduced following trade in the late XVIIth and the Kikongo term for salt fish, makayabu, comes from the term bacalhau (ba-cal-ha-u). The Portuguese culinary influence is especially prominent in Angola, Sao Tom√© and Equatorial Guinea. Central Africa has also been influenced by the cuisine of the regions East, West and Southern Africa because of their close proximity. I.e: Babut√©/Bobotie is shared with the south, nyama choma with the east and gombos with West Africa. Ntaba Central African-style lamb barbecue The main ingredients are plantains, cassava, rice, kwanga (cassava dumpling) and yam. Fufu-like starchy foods are usually made from fermented cassava roots, but they can also be made with plantain, corn maize and yam. Fufu is served buffet style with grilled meat, fish, stews, greens and piment . A variety of local ingredients are used while preparing other dishes like spinach stew cooked with tomato, peppers, chillis, onions, and peanut butter. Eastern central Africa is also one of the few regions in Africa that uses potatoes as one of its main bases, since potatoes grow easily in the region. Cassava plants are also consumed as cooked greens. Groundnut (peanut) stew is also prepared, containing chicken, okra, ginger, and other spices. Another commonly served dish is bambara, a porridge of rice, peanut butter and sugar. Chicken and fish are favorite meat dishes, but game meat preparations containing crocodile, elephant, antelope and warthog are also served occasionally. = Countries = * Angolan cuisine * Cameroonian cuisine * Cuisine of the Central African Republic * Chadian cuisine * Congolese cuisine * Cuisine of Equatorial Guinea * Gabonese cuisine * Cuisine of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe East Africa Ugali is pictured here with a side dish of cabbage, though it is more typically eaten with collard greens (sukuma wiki). Barbecued beef cubes and seafood in Forodhani Gardens, Zanzibar Kitcha fit-fit, a mainstay in Eritrean cuisine, is presented with a scoop of fresh yoghurt and topped with berbere (spice). The cuisine of East Africa varies from area to area. In the inland savannah, the traditional cuisine of cattle- keeping peoples is distinctive in that meat products are generally absent. Cattle, sheep, pigs and goats were regarded as a form of currency and a store of wealth, and are not generally consumed as food. In some areas, traditional East Africans consume the milk and blood of cattle, but rarely the meat. Elsewhere, other peoples are farmers who grow a variety of grains and vegetables. Maize (corn) is the basis of ugali, the local version of West and Central Africa's fufu. Ugali is a starch dish eaten with meats or stews. In Uganda, steamed green bananas called matoke provide the starch filler of many meals. Around 1000 years ago, Omani and Yemeni merchants settled on the Swahili Coast. Middle Eastern influences are especially reflected in the Swahili cuisine of the coast - steamed or cooked rice with spices in Persian style; saffron, cloves, cinnamon and several other spices; and pomegranate juice. Several centuries later, the British and the Indians came, and both brought with them foods such as Indian spiced vegetable curries, lentil soups, chapattis and a variety of pickles which have influenced various local dishes. Some common ingredients used in this region include oranges, lemons, limes, chillis, capsicum peppers, maize, tomatoes, and strawberries. In the Horn of Africa, the main traditional dishes in Eritrean cuisine and Ethiopian cuisine are tsebhis (stews) served with injera\\"Eritrean Food Practices.\\" Webcitation.org. Accessed July 2011. (flatbread made from teff, wheat, or sorghum) and hilbet (paste made from legumes, mainly lentils and fava beans). Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries. Eritrean and Ethiopian food habits vary regionally. In the highlands, injera is the staple diet and is eaten daily among the Tigrinya. Injera is made out of teff, wheat, barley, sorghum or corn, and resembles a spongy, slightly sour pancake. When eating, diners generally share food from a large tray placed in the center of a low dining table. Numerous injera is layered on this tray and topped with various spicy stews. Diners then break into the section of injera in front of them, tearing off pieces and dipping them into the stews. In the lowlands, the main dish is akelet, a porridge-like dish made from wheat flour dough. A ladle is used to scoop out the top, which is filled with berbere and butter sauce and surrounded by milk or yoghurt. A small piece of dough is broken and then used to scoop up the sauce. Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisine: Injera (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of wat (stew) The best known Ethio-Eritrean cuisine consists of various vegetable or meat side dishes and entr√©es, usually a wat, or thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour. One does not eat with utensils, but instead uses injera to scoop up the entr√©es and side dishes. Tihlo, prepared from roasted barley flour, is very popular in Amhara, Agame, and Awlaelo (Tigray). Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no pork or shellfish of any kind, as they are forbidden in the Jewish and Ethiopian Orthodox Christian faiths. It is also very common to eat from the same dish in the center of the table with a group of people. Somali version of halva, is a festive dish in Somali cuisine. Somali cuisine varies from region to region and consists of an exotic mixture of diverse culinary influences. It is the product of Somalia's rich tradition of trade and commerce. Despite the variety, there remains one thing that unites the various regional cuisines: all food is served halal. There are therefore no pork dishes, alcohol is not served, nothing that died on its own is eaten, and no blood is incorporated. Qaddo or lunch is often elaborate. Varieties of bariis (rice), the most popular probably being basmati, usually serve as the main dish. Spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and sage are used to aromatize these different rice dishes. Somalis serve dinner as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, dinner is often served after Tarawih prayers, sometimes as late as 11 pm. Xalwo (halwo) or halva is a popular confection served during special occasions such as Eid celebrations or wedding receptions. It is made from sugar, cornstarch, cardamom powder, nutmeg powder, and ghee. Peanuts are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor.Barlin Ali, Somali Cuisine, (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79 After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using frankincense (lubaan) or incense (cuunsi), which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a dabqaad. North Africa Fresh couscous with vegetables and chickpeas. North Africa lies along the Mediterranean Sea and encompasses within its fold several nations, including Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan. The roots of North African cuisine can be traced back to the ancient empires of North Africa, particularly in Egypt, where many of the country's dishes and culinary traditions date back to African antiquity. Over several centuries traders, travelers, invaders, migrants and immigrants all have influenced the cuisine of North Africa. The Phoenicians of the 1st century brought sausages, while the Carthaginians introduced wheat and its by-product, semolina. The Berbers adapted semolina into couscous, one of the main staple foods. Olives and olive oil were introduced before the arrival of the Romans. From the 7th century onwards, the Arabs introduced a variety of spices, like saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and cloves, which contributed and influenced the culinary culture of North Africa. The Ottoman Turks brought sweet pastries and other bakery products, and from the New World, North Africa got potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini and chili peppers. Most of the North African countries have several similar dishes, sometimes almost the same dish with a different name (the Moroccan tangia and the Tunisian coucha are both essentially the same dish, a meat stew prepared in an urn and cooked overnight in a public oven), sometimes with a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. To add to the confusion, two completely different dishes may also share the same name (for example, a \\"tajine\\" dish is a slow-cooked stew in Morocco, whereas the Tunisian \\"tajine\\" is a baked omelette/quiche-like dish). There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different nations, from the sophisticated, full- bodied flavors of Moroccan palace cookery to the fiery dishes of Tunisian cuisine and the humbler, simpler cuisines of Egypt and Algeria. Southern Africa Traditional South African cuisine. The cooking of Southern Africa is sometimes called \\"rainbow cuisine\\", as the food in this region is a blend of many cultures: indigenous African societies, European, and Asian. To understand indigenous African cuisine, it is important to understand the various native peoples of southern Africa. The indigenous Africans of Southern Africa were roughly divided into two groups and several subgroups. The largest group consisted of the Bantu-speakers, whose descendants today may identify themselves by various subgroup names such as Ndebele, Shona, Venda, Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Sotho, Tswana, Pedi, Shangaan and Tsonga. They arrived in the region around 2,000 years ago, bringing crop cultivation, animal husbandry, and iron toolmaking with them. Hence the Bantu-speakers grew grain crops extensively and raised cattle, sheep and goats. They also grew and continue to grow pumpkins, beans, and leafy greens as vegetables. A smaller group were the primeval residents of the region, the Khoisan, who some archaeologists believe had lived in the region for at least 10,000 years. Many descendants of the Khoisan people have now been incorporated into the population of South Africa. The Khoisan originally were hunter-gatherers (who came to be known as \\"San\\" by the Bantu-speakers and as \\"bushmen\\" by Europeans). After the arrival of the Bantu-speakers, however, some Khoisan adopted the Bantu-speakers' raising of cattle but did not grow crops. The Khoisan who raised cattle called themselves \\"Khoi-Khoi\\" and came to be known by Europeans as \\"Hottentots.\\" Potjiekos is a traditional Afrikaner stew made with meat and vegetables and cooked over coals in cast-iron pots. People were, in other words, defined to some extent by the kinds of food they ate. The Bantu-speakers ate dishes of grain, meat, milk and vegetables, as well as fermented grain and fermented milk products, while the Khoi-Khoi ate meat and milk, and the San hunted wild animals and gathered wild tubers and vegetables. In many ways, the daily food of native South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their native African ancestors ate. The Khoisan ate roasted meat, and they also dried meat for later use. The influence of their diet is reflected in the universal Southern African love of barbecue (generally called in South Africa by its Afrikaans name, a \\"braai\\") and biltong (dried preserved meat). The traditional beer was ubiquitous in the southern African diet, and the fermentation added additional nutrients to the diet. It was a traditional obligation for any family to be able to offer a visitor copious amounts of beer. Beer brewing was done by women, and the status of a housewife in pre-colonial southern Africa depended significantly on her skill at brewing delicious beer. A carton and glass of mageu, a traditional non-alcoholic drink made from fermented mealie pap that is popular among many of the Nguni people. Milk was historically one of the most important components of the southern African diet. Cattle were considered a man's most important possession, and in order to marry, a man had to compensate his prospective in-laws with a gift of cattle as a dowry for his bride. A married man was expected to provide a generous supply of milk to his wife and children, along with meat whenever he slaughtered cattle, sheep or goats. Because there was no refrigeration, most milks was soured into a kind of yogurt. The young men of the family often took care of the cattle far away from the villages at \\"cattle posts,\\" and they sent a steady stream of yogurt home on behalf of their fathers. Today, many Black South Africans enjoy drinking sour milk products that are sold in the supermarket, comparable to American buttermilk, yogurt, and sour cream. On weekends they, like white South Africans, will have a \\"braai\\", and the meal usually consists of \\"pap and vleis\\", which is maize porridge and grilled meat. The basic ingredients include seafood, meat products (including wild game), poultry, as well as grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruits include apples, grapes, mangoes, bananas and papayas, avocado, oranges, peaches and apricots. Desserts may simply be fruit, but there are some more western-style puddings, such as Malva Pudding reminiscent of Sticky toffee pudding, which was inspired by both British cuisine and Dutch cuisine. Meat products include lamb, and game like venison, ostrich, and impala. The seafood includes crayfish, prawns, tuna, mussels, oysters, calamari, mackerel, and lobster. There are also several types of traditional and modern alcoholic beverages including many European- style beers. = Countries = * Botswana cuisine * Cuisine of Eswatini * Cuisine of Lesotho * Namibian cuisine * South African cuisine *Mozambican cuisine West Africa West African maafe or groundnut stew, prepared by a Senegalese cook. A typical West African meal is made with starchy items and can contain meat, fish as well as various spices and herbs. A wide array of staples are eaten across the region, including fufu, banku, kenkey (originating from Ghana), foutou, couscous, t√¥, and garri, which are served alongside soups and stews. Fufu is often made from starchy root vegetables such as yams, cocoyams, or cassava, but also from cereal grains like millet, sorghum or plantains. The staple grain or starch varies between regions and ethnic groups, although corn has gained significant ground as it is cheap, swells to greater volumes and creates a beautiful white final product that is greatly desired. Banku and kenkey are maize dough staples, and gari is made from dried grated cassavas. Rice dishes are also widely eaten in the region, especially in the dry Sahel belt inland. Examples of these include benachin from The Gambia and Jollof rice, a pan-West African rice dish similar to Arab kabsah. Seeds of Guinea pepper (Aframomum melegueta; also called grains of paradise or melagueta pepper), a native West African plant, were used as a spice and even reached Europe, through North African middlemen, during the Middle Ages. Centuries before the influence of Europeans, West Africans were trading with the Arab world and spices like cinnamon, cloves, and mint were not unknown and became part of the local flavorings. Centuries later, the Portuguese, French and British influenced the regional cuisines, but only to a limited extent. Jollof rice is a popular dish throughout West Africa. The local cuisine and recipes of West Africa continue to remain deeply entrenched in the local customs and traditions, with ingredients like native rice (Oryza glaberrima), rice, fonio, millet, sorghum, Bambara groundnuts and Hausa groundnuts, black-eyed peas, brown beans, and root vegetables such as yams, cocoyams, sweet potatoes, and cassava. Cooking techniques include roasting, baking, boiling, frying, mashing, and spicing. A range of sweets and savories are also prepared. Klouikloui, rings of fried peanut butter as served in Benin. Cooking techniques of West Africa are changing. In the past West Africans ate much less meat and used native oils (palm oil on the coast and shea butter in Sahelian regions). Baobob leaf and numerous local greens were everyday staples during certain times of the year. Today the diet is much heavier in meats, salt, and fats. Many dishes combine fish and meat, including dried and fermented fish. Flaked and dried fish is often fried in oil, and sometimes cooked in sauce made up with hot peppers, onions, tomatoes, and various spices (such as soumbala) and water to prepare a highly flavored stew. In some areas beef and mutton are preferred, and goat meat is the dominant red meat. Suya, a popular grilled spicy meat kebab flavored with peanuts and other spices, is sold by street vendors as a snack or evening meal and is typically made with beef or chicken. It is common to have a preponderance of seafood and the seafood, as earlier stated, is sometimes also mixed with other meat products. Guinea fowl eggs, eggs and chicken are also preferred. With regard to beverages, water has a very strong ritual significance in many West African nations (particularly in dry areas) and water is often the first thing an African host will offer his/her guest. Palm wine is also a common beverage made from the fermented sap of various types of palm trees and is usually sold in sweet (less-fermented, retaining more of the sap's sugar) or sour (fermented longer, making it stronger and less sweet) varieties. Millet beer is another common beverage. = Countries = * Benin cuisine * Burkinab√© cuisine, Burkina Faso * Gambian cuisine * Ghanaian cuisine * Cuisine of Guinea-Bissau * Cuisine of Guinea * Ivorian cuisine * Liberian cuisine * Malian cuisine * Mauritanian cuisine * Nigerian cuisine * Cuisine of Niger * Cuisine of Saint Helena * Senegalese cuisine * Cuisine of Sierra Leone * Togolese cuisine See also * AfroFoodtv.com * List of African dishes * Cuisine of Seychelles * Tiep References Further reading * Cuisine Food- and drink-related lists Cuisine by continent ","title":"African cuisine"},{"id":"1769399","text":"Caritas may refer to: * The Latin term for charity (virtue), one of the three theological virtues.

The area occupied by speakers of these languages includes Polynesia, as well as much of Melanesia and Micronesia. Though covering a vast area, Oceanic languages are spoken by only two million people. The largest individual Oceanic languages are Eastern Fijian with over 600,000 speakers, and Samoan with an estimated 400,000 speakers. The Gilbertese (Kiribati), Tongan, Tahitian, MƒÅori, Western Fijian and Tolai (Gazelle Peninsula) languages each have over 100,000 speakers. The common ancestor which is reconstructed for this group of languages is called Proto-Oceanic (abbr. \\"POc\\"). Classification The Oceanic languages were first shown to be a language family by Sidney Herbert Ray in 1896 and, besides Malayo-Polynesian, they are the only established large branch of Austronesian languages. Grammatically, they have been strongly influenced by the Papuan languages of northern New Guinea, but they retain a remarkably large amount of Austronesian vocabulary.Mark Donohue and Tim Denham, 2010. Farming and Language in Island Southeast Asia: Reframing Austronesian History. Current Anthropology, 51(2):223‚Äì256. =Lynch, Ross, & Crowley (2002)= According to Lynch, Ross, & Crowley (2002), Oceanic languages often form linkages with each other. Linkages are formed when languages emerged historically from an earlier dialect continuum. The linguistic innovations shared by adjacent languages define a chain of intersecting subgroups (a linkage), for which no distinct proto-language can be reconstructed.The Wave model is more appropriate than the Tree model for representing such linkages: see . Lynch, Ross, & Crowley (2002) propose three primary groups of Oceanic languages: *Admiralties linkage: languages of Manus Island, its offshore islands, and small islands to the west. *Western Oceanic (WOc) linkage: languages of the north coast of Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea (excluding the Admiralties) and the western Solomon Islands. West Oceanic is made up of three or four sub-linkages and families: :*? Sarmi‚ÄìJayapura linkage: maybe part of the North New Guinea linkage? :*North New Guinea linkage: consists of languages of the north coast of New Guinea, east from Jayapura. :*Meso-Melanesian linkage: consists of languages of the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands. :*Papuan Tip linkage: consists of languages of the tip of the Papuan Peninsula. *Central‚ÄìEastern Oceanic (CEOc) linkage: nearly all languages of Oceania not included in the Admiralties and Western Oceanic. Central‚ÄìEastern consists of four or five subgroups: :*Southeast Solomonic linkage: of the South East Solomon Islands. :*(Utupua‚ÄìVanikoro linkage: later removed to Temotu languages). :*Southern Oceanic linkage: consists of languages of New Caledonia and Vanuatu. :*Central Oceanic linkage: consists of the Polynesian languages, and the languages of Fiji. :*Micronesian linkage. The \\"residues\\" (as they are called by Lynch, Ross, & Crowley), which do not fit into the three groups above, but are still classified as Oceanic are: *St. Matthias Islands linkage. *? Yapese language: of the island of Yap. Perhaps part of the Admiralties? Ross & N√¶ss (2007) removed Utupua‚ÄìVanikoro, from Central‚ÄìEastern Oceanic, to a new primary branch of Oceanic: *Temotu linkage, named after the Temotu Province of the Solomon Islands.

Lapita Canoes and Their Multi-Ethnic Crews: Might Marginal Austronesian Languages Be Non-Austronesian? Paper presented at the Workshop on the Languages of Papua 3. 20-24 January 2014, Manokwari, West Papua, Indonesia. argues that many languages conventionally classified as Oceanic are in fact non-Austronesian (or \\"Papuan\\", which is a geographic rather genetic grouping), including Utupua and Vanikoro. Blench doubts that Utupua and Vanikoro are closely related, and thus should not be grouped together. Since each of the three Utupua and three Vanikoro languages are highly distinct from each other, Blench doubts that these languages had diversified on the islands of Utupua and Vanikoro, but had rather migrated to the islands from elsewhere. According to Blench, historically this was due to the Lapita demographic expansion consisting of both Austronesian and non-Austronesian settlers migrating from the Lapita homeland in the Bismarck Archipelago to various islands further to the east. Other languages traditionally classified as Oceanic that Blench (2014) suspects are in fact non-Austronesian include the Kaulong language of West New Britain, which has a Proto-Malayo-Polynesian vocabulary retention rate of only 5%, and languages of the Loyalty Islands that are spoken just to the north of New Caledonia. Blench (2014) proposes that languages classified as: *Austronesian, but perhaps actually non-Austronesian are spoken in northern Vanuatu and southern Vanuatu (North Vanuatu languages and South Vanuatu languages). *Austronesian, but may have experienced bilingualism with non- Austronesian are spoken in central Vanuatu and New Caledonia (Central Vanuatu languages and New Caledonian languages). *non-Austronesian, with some other languages traditionally classified as Austronesian may perhaps actually be non-Austronesian are spoken in the Solomon Islands and New Britain (various Meso-Melanesian languages).

Early history In 1978, Air Chief Marshal Sir Christopher Foxley-Norris approached the major British tobacco companies regarding a possible Tobacco Consumers' Association. Foxley-Norris, a pipe and cigar smoker, said that he was concerned about the increasing interference by 'the Government and other do-gooding bodies' in people's lives, and that he was surprised that the industry had not put up any co-ordinated response to anti- smoking measures. He added that, having retired from the RAF in 1974, he was seeking a salaried position in such an organisation to supplement his pension. At around the same time, Lieutenant-General Sir Geoffrey Charles Evans, a cigarette smoker and formerly General Secretary of the National Union of Retail Tobacconists made similar proposals to industry figures. The Tobacco Advisory Committee (TAC), the then British tobacco industry trade association, agreed that the time was right to launch a pro-smoking group. TAC stated that the new organisation would need to 'be closely controlled and supported by the industry, but be seen to be sufficiently independent to maintain its credibility'. After some debate as to whether Evans or Foxley-Norris should run the group, FOREST was launched on 19 June 1979, with Foxley-Norris chairman and Evans chief executive, the men being the group's first two members. Soon after launch, a March 1980 TAC memo showed that the tobacco industry felt that there was confusion about the organisation's purpose, doubts as to the effectiveness of FOREST's activities, and continuing uncertainty as to whether it should endeavour to recruit a mass membership or continue to serve the industry directly. Further doubts were expressed over FOREST's direction by TAC figures in 1981, with some companies questioning whether to continue funding the group, or to establish a different, more effective group. A model for a pro-smoking pressure group was agreed by TAC members, and it was further agreed that this model would be applied to the existing FOREST organisation, rather than attempting to establish a new pro- smoking group. The restructured FOREST would require a new chief executive to replace Evans, and would not only react to news and tobacco control developments, but would seek to make its own news in the form of conducting research and lobbying. Individual members were seen as 'desirable', but not essential. Leadership and influence FOREST's dependence on tobacco industry funding has ensured considerable industry influence upon its leadership and direction. The Tobacco Advisory Council selected Foxley-Norris as the first Chairman of FOREST in 1979, and when, by 1981, FOREST was felt by the TAC members to be ineffective, Stephen Eyres was selected as Director of a restructured organisation. From this point on, the leadership of FOREST has tended to be drawn from amongst elements of the libertarian movement. The 1981 restructuring proposal stated that 'If money invested [in FOREST] is to be properly effective then control and management are essential' and that contact between the Executive Director of FOREST and the Tobacco Advisory Council should be made \\"on an almost daily basis.\\" However, given that 'nobody of worth to a campaigning organisation can be run on too tight a rein', funding would be guaranteed on an annual basis. Evans continued to be involved for some time until dying in 1987. Eyres, meanwhile, was suffering from increasing ill-health as a result of HIV, and Chris Tame was recruited to succeed both as the organisation's effective leader in 1988; a non-smoker, Tame voiced a concern about the potential wider impact of measures to reduce exposure from second-hand smoke, arguing from a libertarian perspective that individuals‚Äô right to make their own health decisions may need defending.Chris R. Tame, Founder of the Libertarian Alliance , Sean Gabb, The Independent, 23 March 2006 Foxley-Norris remained a public figurehead until retiring in 1989, and was replaced by Lord Harris of High Cross, general director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, and pipe smoker. In September 1989 Eyres, still employed by FOREST, was accused of misusing Forest funds to buy first class flights to Australia and a property in Spain. The tobacco industry was keen to avoid any publicity and Eyres' resignation, effective as of 1 October 1989, and an agreement not to discuss the circumstances of the termination of his employment, was confirmed in a High Court judgement, of November 1989. Eyres died in 1990. Harris remained as chairman of FOREST until his death in 2006, while Tame, who took over from Eyres as Director of Forest, continued in the position until 1995, when he was removed by the tobacco industry following concerns about his approach.Chris Tame, Marc Glendening, The Guardian, 5 April 2006 Eyres was replaced by Marjorie Nicholson, who had previously been the organisation's campaign manager, standing for Parliament at the 1994 Dudley West by-election under the FOREST name. The current director, Simon Clark, took over from Nicholson in 1999. Launching a spin-off campaign entitled 'The Free Society', a more general campaign against the perceived 'nanny state', Clark stated 'If people wish to eat themselves to death by eating too much fatty food that has to be their choice'. Media profile Foxley-Norris was interviewed on 25 July 1979 by BBC London, criticising measures such as smoke- free regulations which had been introduced on Glasgow public transport and asking members of the public to join FOREST at the cost of ¬£1/year. FOREST spokespeople continue to appear on television and radio in the United Kingdom and are quoted by British newspapers and broadcasters as representatives of a pro-tobacco viewpoint. Despite this media visibility, FOREST's internal communications to the tobacco industry have argued that its real successes \\"cannot be publicised\\": > Measuring FOREST purely in terms of media coverage denies the existence of > other work in which it is engaged but which cannot be publicised. In short, > if others can be persuaded to \\"sing the same tune\\" this is of more value > than anything that might be said by the tobacco industry itself, or FOREST. Less direct techniques have also been made use of to maximise media impact while promoting an appearance of independence from the tobacco industry. This is acknowledged in FOREST's 1985 Directors' report, stating that ‚Äúthe arms- length relationship with the industry has worked to the benefit of both parties‚Äù and noting that letter-writers were \\"retained\\" to provide an active local media presence.Eyres, Stephen \\"Forest 1985 Director‚Äôs Report\\", London, 1985. Retrieved on 17 January 2012. Funding and membership Marketing itself as the \\"voice and friend of the smoker\\", FOREST has nevertheless been described as an astroturf front group created and primarily funded by the tobacco industry. Its establishment was planned by the Tobacco Advisory Committee, the British tobacco industry trade association. At a 1979 meeting, the Tobacco Advisory Committee discussed the launch of FOREST as well as ways to maintain its appearance of independence. After its founding, membership campaigns were not successful in recruiting a broad support base which could make the organisation self-financing. In one instance, 10,000 cigarette retailers were solicited to join FOREST, but only four joined. Financial support from the tobacco industry thus remains the main source of funding for FOREST. Notable supporters While opposing proposals to restrict smoking in public places, FOREST attracted the support of celebrity smokers including artist David Hockney, inventor Trevor Baylis, musician Joe Jackson, chef Antony Worrall Thompson, and social commentator Claire Fox. Its more recent campaign to reverse smoke-free workplace regulations in licensed premises lists several politicians as supporters (see below). Developments following the smoking ban In February 2006, FOREST lost its fight against comprehensive smoke-free workplace regulations in England, achieved via a House of Commons free vote and subsequently implemented on 1 July 2007. Complementing smoke-free workplace regulations already introduced in Scotland (March 2006), Northern Ireland and Wales (both April 2007), these included all pubs, bars, caf√©s and restaurants, private members' clubs and any indoor workplace. Following this UK-wide defeat, FOREST has undertaken to continue to lobby under a 'freedom of choice' banner and in 2010 launched an Irish branch, Forest Eireann ‚Äì the Republic of Ireland having instituted nationwide smoke- free workplace regulations in March 2004. Concern about the potential impact of smoke-free regulations upon the income of publicans and licensees was a theme in FOREST's subsequent opposition to smoke-free workplace measures. FOREST launched its 'Save Our Pubs and Clubs' Campaign in 2009, with Greg Knight, Conservative MP, and Anthony Worrall-Thompson in attendance. It was backed by David Clelland, Labour MP, John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP, and Nigel Farage MEP, and leader of UKIP. The campaign called for pubs and clubs to be able to choose whether to allow smoking and listed as supporters the Working Men's Club and Institute Union, the Adam Smith Institute, thinktank Progressive Vision and the Manifesto Club.

It provides enterprise engineering and geospatially powered software to businesses, governments, and organizations around the world, and operates through three divisions: Hexagon PPM, Hexagon Safety & Infrastructure, and Hexagon Geospatial. The company‚Äôs headquarters is in Madison, Alabama, United States. In 2008, Intergraph was one of the one hundred largest software companies in the world. In July 2010, Intergraph was acquired by Hexagon AB. History M&S; Computing exhibit at a trade show in 1978 Intergraph was founded in 1969 as M&S; Computing, Inc., by former IBM engineers Jim Meadlock, his wife Nancy, Terry Schansman (the S of M&S;), Keith Schonrock, and Robert Thurber who had been working with NASA and the U.S. Army in developing systems that would apply digital computing to real time missile guidance. The company was later renamed to Intergraph Corporation in 1980. One of Intergraph's major hardware projects was developing a line of workstations using the Clipper architecture created by Fairchild Semiconductor. Intergraph was one of only two companies to use the chips in a major product line. Intergraph developed their own version of UNIX for the architecture, which they called CLIX. In 1987, Intergraph bought the Fairchild division responsible for the chip. In 1997, Intergraph began pursuing litigation against Intel and other computer hardware manufacturers based on the intellectual property developed in Clipper. Intergraph negotiated major settlements with Intel, HP, TI and Gateway, earning the company over $394M. In 2000, Intergraph exited the hardware business and became purely a software company. On July 21, 2000, it sold its Intense3D graphics accelerator division to 3Dlabs, and its workstation and server division to Silicon Graphics. On November 29, 2006, Intergraph was acquired by an investor group led by Hellman & Friedman LLC, Texas Pacific Group and JMI Equity, making the company privately held. On October 28, 2010, Intergraph was acquired by Hexagon AB. The transaction marks the return of Intergraph as part of a publicly traded company. As part of the Hexagon acquisition, Hexagon moved the management of ERDAS, Inc. from under Leica Geosystems to Intergraph, and Z/I Imaging airborne imaging sensors from under Intergraph to Leica Geosystems.

In the ruling dynasties and noble families of much of Europe and Asia, the family's major assets‚Äîrealm, titles, fiefs, property and income‚Äîhave historically been passed from a father to his firstborn son in what is known as primogeniture; younger sons‚Äîcadets‚Äîinherited less wealth and authority to pass to future generations of descendants. In families and cultures in which this was not the custom or law, as in the feudal Holy Roman Empire, equal distribution of the family's holdings among male members was eventually apt to so fragment the inheritance as to render it too small to sustain the descendants at the socio-economic level of their forefather. Moreover, brothers and their descendants sometimes quarreled over their allocations, or even became estranged. While agnatic primogeniture became a common way of keeping the family's wealth intact and reducing familial disputes, it did so at the expense of younger sons and their descendants. Both before and after a state legal default of inheritance by primogeniture, younger brothers sometimes vied with older brothers to be chosen their father's heir or, after the choice was made, sought to usurp the elder's birthright. Status In such cases, primary responsibility for promoting the family's prestige, aggrandizement, and fortune fell upon the senior branch for future generations. A cadet, having less means, was not expected to produce a family. If a cadet chose to raise a family, its members were expected to maintain the family's social status by avoiding derogation, but could pursue endeavors too demeaning or too risky for the senior branch, such as emigration to another sovereign's realm, engagement in commerce, or a profession such as law, religion, academia, military service or government office. Some cadet branches came to inherit the crown of the senior line, e.g. the Bourbon Counts of Vend√¥me mounted the throne of France (after civil war) in 1593; the House of Savoy-Carignan succeeded to the kingdoms of Sardinia (1831) and Italy (1861); the Counts Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken obtained the Palatine Electorate by the Rhein (1799) and the Kingdom of Bavaria (1806); and a deposed Duke of Nassau was restored to sovereignty in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (1890). In other cases, a junior branch came to eclipse more senior lines in rank and power, e.g. the Kings of Prussia and German Emperors who were junior by primogeniture to the Counts and Princes of Hohenzollern, and the Electors and Kings of Saxony who were a younger branch of the House of Wettin than the Grand Dukes of Saxe-Weimar. A still more junior branch of the Wettins, headed by the rulers of the small Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, would, through diplomacy or marriage in the 19th and 20th centuries, obtain or consort and sire the royal crowns of, successively, Belgium, Portugal, Bulgaria and the Commonwealth realms. Also, marriage to cadet males of the Houses of Oldenburg (Holstein-Gottorp), Polignac, and Bourbon-Parma brought those dynasties patrilineally to the thrones of Russia, Monaco, and Luxembourg, respectively. The Dutch royal house has, at different times, been a cadet branch of Mecklenburg and Lippe(-Biesterfeld). In the Commonwealth realms, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and his male-line descendants are cadet members of the House of Gl√ºcksburg. It was a risk that cadet branches maintaining legal heirs could sink in status. This could be due to shrunken wealth too meagre to survive shifting political upheavals (e.g. legal mechanisms in factionalism or revolution of attainder, capital offences and show trials) as much as unpopularity or distance from the reigning line. *The Capetian branch of the princes de Courtenay's last 'prince' died in 1733 without recognition by the crown as dynastic princes du sang despite undisputed but remote male-line descent from Louis VI of France. *The principi di Ottajano (of the House of Medici) were heirs to the grand duchy of Tuscany when last male of that more senior branch died in 1737, yet were bypassed by intervention of Europe's major powers, which allocated the title to Francesco II Stefano, of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. *The Romanovs, which dominated Russia's throne (owed to kinship-by-marriage to tsar Ivan the Terrible) from 1613 to the end of monarchy, became reluctant to stress they descended from the 9th century founding ruler Rurik after 1880, when Tsar Alexander II wed Catherine Dolgorukov, a Rurikid princess. In part so that later cadet children could be sidelined, and part because the marriage was deemed morganatic for Alexander having long been involved with Catherine as his mistress. Notable cadet branches * House of York; descendants of the fourth son of Edward III Plantagenet, King of England, who, in the course of the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485), displaced the agnatically senior line of Plantagenets, the Lancaster branch, on the English throne (1461), only to be finally displaced themselves by a Lancastrian cognatic descendant, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, who obtained the crown by conquest from Richard III (August 1485). As Henry VII, he took as queen consort the heiress of the cadet branch, Elizabeth of York, in January 1486. Their son, Henry VIII, thus united in his person and on the throne of England both branches of the Plantagenets, while inaugurating the House of Tudor which ruled England until 1603. *House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg; descendants of a younger son of King Christian III of Denmark (of the House of Oldenburg), who eventually became monarchs of Denmark, Norway and Greece, and of which Charles, Prince of Wales, is patrilineally a member. *House of Bourbon; descendants of a younger son of Louis IX of France who, in the person of Henry IV of France inherited the throne of France from the senior Capetian line of the Valois in 1589; and from which sprang the Bourbon kings of Spain (including the Carlist and French legitimist lines), the kings of the Two Sicilies, and the sovereign Dukes of Parma, who currently reign in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in a cadet line. Also from Louis XIII de Bourbon descends the cadet branch known as the House of Orl√©ans, to which the Citizen-king Louis-Philippe, the Orleanist claimants to the throne of France (Henri, comte de Paris, duc de France) belong, as does the House of Orleans-Braganza. *House of Gonzaga; The noble family who reigned in Mantua counted in their dynasty some cadet branches. *House of Guise; Although the Dukes of Lorraine exercised continental independence, nominally they were vassals of the Holy Roman Emperors and their geo-political importance resided less in the size of their realm than in their crucial location between the competing French and German nations. A younger brother of Duke Antoine, Claude of Lorraine, was appanaged with the lordship of Guise in France and betook himself to the French court in search of his fortune. There, he was granted the title Duke of Guise as a member of the Peerage of France, he and his male-line descendants henceforth being accorded the rank of prince √©tranger. As the Protestant Reformation threatened the unity of France the conspicuous loyalty of Claude's descendants to the Roman Catholic Church, combined with their barely concealed ambition upon the throne of the last Valois kings, infused the Guises with unequalled power in French politics. Their role in Paris and France's wars extended their influence in European affairs, until the accession of the House of Bourbon to the throne in 1593, far beyond that of their senior cousins reigning in Nancy. *Mandela: Nelson Mandela, the late president of the Republic of South Africa, was a male-line great-grandson of King Ngubengcuka of the Thembu nation of Southern African Xhosas. Be that as it may, he was, and fellow members of the Mandela branch of the Thembus' ruling royal dynasty are, ineligible to succeed to the ancestral throne because they all descend from Ngubengcuka's morganatic marriage to a woman of a ritually inferior family. As such, their traditional role in the kingdom is that of hereditary privy counsellors to Thembu monarchs, unable to succeed to the throne themselves. In addition to this the family's recognized leader, Chief Mandla Mandela, also serves by tradition as the tribal chieftain of Mvezo under the authority of his relative the paramount chief of Thembuland, currently King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. *Spencer: the comital branch of the Spencer family descended from John Spencer, the youngest son of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and Lady Anne Churchill. The couple's eldest son Robert inherited his father's title of Earl of Sunderland. When Robert, 4th Earl of Sunderland died without an heir, his paternal titles passed to his younger brother, Charles, who later inherited the title of Duke of Marlborough upon the death of his aunt Henrietta, and became the 3rd Duke of Marlborough. Charles' descendants (later known as the Spencer-Churchills) became the senior branch of the Spencer family. His younger brother, John, had an only son, also named John, who became the 1st Earl Spencer. From the line of the Earls Spencer descend many prominent figures, including Diana, Princess of Wales, whose son Prince William, Duke of Cambridge was born heir eventual to the Crown of the United Kingdom. *Wellington; Arthur Wellesley, the younger brother of Richard Wellesley, the 2nd Earl of Mornington, started his career as a prot√©g√© of his older brother. He entered the military, a traditional occupation of younger sons. From 1809 to 1814 he won a series of very significant victories, and was awarded a series of ascending titles; Baron Douro, Viscount Wellington, Earl of Wellington, Marquess of Wellington and, finally, Duke of Wellington. A descendant of Baron Cowley, youngest brother of Richard Wellesley, became Earl of Cowley in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, his junior line of the family thereby also achieving a higher status than that of the Earldom of Mornington in the Peerage of Ireland. *In the case of the House of Saud the surname \\"Al Saud\\" is carried by any descendant of Muhammad bin Saud or his three brothers Farhan, Thunayyan, and Mishari. Al Saud's other family branches like the Al Kabir, the Al Jiluwi, the Al Thunayan, the Al Mishari and the Al Farhan are called cadet branches. Members of the cadet branches hold high and influential positions in government though they are not in line of succession to Saudi throne. Many cadet members intermarry within the Al Saud to reestablish their lineage and continue to wield influence in the government. Sons, daughters, patrilineal granddaughters and grandsons of Ibn Saud are referred to by the style \\"His Royal Highness\\" (HRH), differing from those belonging to the cadet branches, who are called \\"His Highness\\" (HH) and in addition to that a reigning king has the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. *The Minamoto clan was a cadet branch of the Imperial House of Japan that was directly descended first from Emperor Saga and then from Emperor Seiwa. Despite their origins as a noble family that was excluded from the line of succession, the Minamoto became one of the four great clans that dominated Japanese politics during the Heian period and, after winning the Genpei war, established the first Shogunate.

The program normally originates from Limbaugh's studios near his home in Palm Beach County, Florida, where Limbaugh has lived since 1996. WJNO, Limbaugh's affiliate in Palm Beach County, serves as the de facto flagship station. In the early years of the program, it normally originated from the studios of WABC in New York City (the program's original flagship station), but in 2014, the official flagship became WOR AM 710 in New York City, following Limbaugh's show moving to the iHeart owned station. =Distribution= The Rush Limbaugh Show airs on a network of approximately 590 AM and FM affiliate stations throughout the United States, almost all of which air the program live. During its existence, WRNO broadcast the program on shortwave radio. Limbaugh also hosts his own online Internet streaming audio and video broadcast, through Streamlink. This broadcast is restricted to members of Limbaugh's ‚ÄúRush 24/7‚Äù service, but can also be heard on some stations' streaming audio feeds.Streamingradioguide.com Premiere Networks, a division of iHeartMedia, the largest U.S. radio station owner, owns distribution rights to the program. The program is not heard on any stations in Canada, although stations along the northern border of the United States give the show coverage in much of southern Canada. The show has never been carried on any satellite radio service, and is one of the few nationally syndicated talk radio programs not to be featured on satellite radio. Limbaugh attributes this decision to a desire to maximize value for his terrestrial radio affiliates. The Rush Limbaugh Show is unusual among syndicated radio programs in that it is fee-based; that is, radio stations pay iHeartMedia hundreds of thousands of dollars (the exact amount depends on market size) for the rights to carry his show, in addition to giving up 15 minutes of daily ad time for barter advertisements and the Morning Update. An official weekend edition of the program, consisting of \\"best of\\" clips from the weekday show, entitled The Rush Limbaugh Week in Review, launched in January 2008. =Notable guests= In September 1992, then President George H. W. Bush made an appearance on Limbaugh's show. Charlton Heston called in to the show in 1995 to read from Michael Crichton's book Jurassic Park. Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared on the show in November 2003 when Roger Hedgecock was guest-hosting the show. Former President George W. Bush appeared six times on the program. The first time was during the 2000 presidential campaign. Then, in 2004, he \\"called in\\" to a live broadcast during the week of the 2004 Republican National Convention to give a preview of his nomination acceptance speech. He called in again in 2006. The fourth time was April 18, 2008, when Limbaugh asked the White House to speak with Bush to thank him for the ceremony welcoming Pope Benedict XVI, which awed Limbaugh. The fifth call was during the show's 20th anniversary celebration, in which then-President Bush (and George H. W. Bush and Jeb Bush) congratulated Limbaugh. He appeared a sixth time for an interview regarding his autobiography, Decision Points, on November 9, 2010. Vice President Dick Cheney has made multiple appearances. In 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called in to a live broadcast of the show a day after having called Limbaugh \\"irrelevant\\", adding, \\"I'm not his servant. I'm the people's servant of California,\\" on an appearance on NBC's Today show.Dailybreeze.com Other notable guests who have called in to Limbaugh's show include former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, economist Thomas Sowell, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, and television writer Joel Surnow, who took calls about events in his show, 24. In December 2006, Sylvester Stallone made an appearance on the show to discuss his upcoming movie Rocky Balboa. On February 27, 2004, actor Jim Caviezel called in to the program to discuss The Passion of the Christ, in which Caviezel played the role of Jesus Christ. Republican vice presidential nominee Governor Sarah Palin (R‚ÄìAK) also called into a show before a rally in October 2008 to discuss the election and the economic distortion and impact of Senator Obama's tax policy; Palin returned to the show in November 2009 to discuss her book Going Rogue: An American Life. Phil Gingrey, a congressman who compared shows such as Limbaugh and Sean Hannity to \\"throwing bricks\\" in January 2009, gave an interview on Limbaugh's show the following day. Limbaugh has also had author and Washington Times columnist Bill Gertz on his show to discuss Gertz's books as well as national security issues. In 2007, Limbaugh (among numerous other hosts) interviewed Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and was the first to interview Tony Snow after his departure from his post as White House press secretary. He also interviewed NBC News host Tim Russert in 2004.Excerpts from Rush's 2004 interview with Tim Russert. In May 2010, country musician John Rich reported for Limbaugh on the May 2010 Tennessee floods. Donald Trump appeared on the show April 15, 2011, and donated $100,000 to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, for which Limbaugh holds an annual radiothon. On December 6, 2012, Limbaugh interviewed outgoing Senator Jim DeMint shortly after he announced his resignation from his seat to head the Heritage Foundation.Cirilli, Kevin (December 6, 2012). \\"Jim DeMint tells Rush Limbaugh how to fix GOP, tweaks Boehner\\", Politico. Retrieved December 6, 2012.  Program staff  ; \\"Bo Snerdley\\": The official \\"program-observer\\" and call screener. His real name is James Golden. With other staff members, he assists with research as part of preparation for the show and is in the control booth as the show is being broadcast. He co-hosted a Sunday night talk show, James and Joel, on WABC with Joel Santisteban from 1992 to 1998. Snerdley is a pseudonym Limbaugh invented many years earlier when he was a disc jockey on WIXZ (when Limbaugh went by the name Jeff Christy); he would use the name Snerdley for supposed-listeners who would write or call in, usually professing to be big fans and part of the \\"Christy Nation\\". More recently, the name Snerdley has been used for his call screeners, both male and female. During a show in 2004, Limbaugh was not at the microphone for the last segment of the second hour (it was only about ten seconds), and Snerdley came on instead: \\"This is Bo Snerdley, Rush will be right back on the EIB Network (Excellence in Broadcasting).\\" It was one of the very rare times his voice was heard on the program before 2008. \\"Bo\\" Snerdley screens callers at the Palm Beach Florida broadcasting location and in New York City. In February 2008, Snerdley, who is black,Youtube.com was appointed by Limbaugh as the show's Official Criticizer of Barack Obama: \\"certified black enough to criticize\\"\\"The O.O.C. on Rev. Wright's Crib\\" On the July 24, 2009 show, \\"Bo\\" was put on the air as the \\"Official Obama Criticizer\\", and spoke for roughly five minutes with Rush about the incident with Cambridge police. On October 16, he requested (and received) air time to air a five-minute rant that criticized NFL players, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and media commentators who opposed Rush Limbaugh's potential bid on the St. Louis Rams. ; Koko: The Rush 24/7 Internet site webmaster. This is a nickname, given by Limbaugh when Koko put a gorilla suit on for a gag on Limbaugh's TV show. His real name is George Prayias, and he is currently the webmaster for www.RushLimbaugh.com. ; Cookie: Koko's wife is Cookie Gleason, who is Executive Producer of The Rush Limbaugh Show. She has been with Rush since 1992, starting on his television program. She does research and produces all of the audio sound bites played on Rush's show. She's most known for her audio montages, such as \\"Gravitas\\". She got her nickname from Rush's television show where she played \\"Cookie Gleason\\", a take-off on Cokie Roberts. ; Brian: EIB network broadcast engineer. ; Dawn: Transcribes caller comments onto a computer screen to aid Limbaugh, who hears via a cochlear implant and therefore can sometimes have difficulties clearly understanding callers. ; Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson: ‚ÄúChief of staff‚Äù. Also known as ‚ÄúH.R.‚Äù, Carson was Limbaugh's first employee and screened calls when Limbaugh broadcast from New York City, among other things. Carson's role was reduced as a result of the show's departure from New York along with his own battle with brain cancer beginning in 2011; Carson died January 26, 2015. ; Brett Winterble: A former producer. Winterble, as of 2020, hosts a local program on WBT and a national television program on Newsmax TV.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/184446/brett-winterble-jumps-from-kfmb- to-wbt-charlotte/ ; Altamont: His duties consisted of call screening and board operations, and serving as backup when the others are out or unavailable. Left the show in spring 2006. ; Johnny Donovan: Program announcer who sometimes voices Paul Shanklin's parodies.  Stand-ins for Limbaugh  Every so often, Limbaugh is absent from his show, whether for various personal reasons or because of extended trips. For instance, in early 2005, Limbaugh took a weeklong trip to Afghanistan to report on postwar conditions; he's also participated in various celebrity pro-am golf events, especially when he represents his parent company, iHeartMedia. On those occasions, Limbaugh allows ‚ÄúEIB certified talk show hosts‚Äù (sometimes called \\"Associate Professors from the Limbaugh Institute for Advanced Conservative Studies\\") to fill in for him. Typically, these hosts are well-known conservatives, and since Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia since 2014) acquired the network which syndicates the program, they have often hosts of local shows on iHeartMedia's owned-and- operated stations. A number of Limbaugh's former substitute hosts, including Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bob Dornan and Jason Lewis, have gone on to host nationally syndicated shows of their own. =Recent substitute hosts= ; Mark Belling: Host of The Mark Belling Late Afternoon Show on fellow iHeartMedia station WISN in Milwaukee. ; Mark Steyn: A Canadian journalist, columnist, and film and theater critic. Steyn traditionally hosts from his home in New Hampshire, referred to as EIB - Ice Station Zebra. ; Dr. Walter E. Williams: economics professor, strong proponent of laissez-faire capitalism, and former chairman of the economics department at George Mason University in Virginia. Williams began guest hosting in October 1992, however, in recent years, Williams has not been guest hosting on Rush's show. ; Douglas Urbanski: Award- winning Motion Picture Producer, former Broadway impresario, occasional actor, raconteur, \\"paying subscriber to Rush 24/7,\\" also known as America's Guest Host, Urbanski first hosted three times in 2010, left the rotation to produce films on location (during which he briefly hosted a competing program on Westwood One) and returned to the substitute host rotation in mid-2012. ; Erick Erickson: Founder and editor of RedState and radio host at WSB. Erickson first served as substitute host in 2014. ; Chris Plante: Radio host based at WMAL in Washington, DC. ; Roger Hedgecock: Former mayor of San Diego, California, and a talk radio host at Clear Channel talk station KOGO there. He was, as of 2007, the most used stand-in, and was also a fan favorite. Hedgecock spent several years out of the substitute rotation but has since returned. ; Ken Matthews: A host on WHP in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and WPHT in Philadelphia, subbed for Rush on July 3, July 14, September 1, November 24 and December 26, 2017; on June 22, 2018, and again on March 19, 2020. ; Todd Herman: A host on KTTH in Seattle, Washington, debuted as a guest host for a vacationing Rush on August 24, 2017. He hosted the show on August 25, 2017; on January 2, May 24 and 25, 2018, and again on February 19, 2020. ; Nick Searcy: An actor who stars on the FX show Justified, he debuted as a guest host for a vacationing Rush on December 27, 2017. Jargon Limbaugh uses his own on- air jargon, some of which he invented and some of which he popularized. Notable examples include: :\\"Caller Abortion\\" (Limbaugh's term for disconnecting an unwanted caller, accompanied by the sound effects of screams, a vacuum cleaner and a toilet flushing); :\\"The Chi-Coms\\" (the Communist Chinese government); :\\"Club Gitmo\\" (the U.S. prison for terrorists in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and an allusion to Club Med/Club Fed); :\\"The Congressional Black Caucasians\\" (the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus) :\\"Drive- by media\\" (the mainstream media, analogous to \\"drive-by shooting\\");Sylvester Brown, \\"Rush and pals like to play the media blame game,\\" St. Louis Post Dispatch, March 16, 2006, p. D1. :\\"The Four Corners of Deceit\\": (Limbaugh originally used this commenting on the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, referencing government, universities, science and state media);Nature: Science scorned. September 8, 2010. :\\"Gorbasm\\" (the feeling of euphoria that liberals and the left-wing media had for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev); :\\"The Huffing and Puffington Post\\" (The Huffington Post); :\\"Low- information voters\\" (popularized in a broadcast following the 2012 presidential election); :\\"The Ninth Circus Court of Appeals\\" (refers to The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, noted for its size and for its controversial decisions that are reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court more often than any other U.S. circuit court); :\\"Operation Chaos\\" (an effort promoted by Limbaugh to cause chaos in the Democratic Party primaries by encouraging Republican voters to either cross over or change parties in order to vote for whichever candidate is trailing, thus prolonging the primary process); :\\"State-run media\\" (Limbaugh's more recent term for the mainstream media, particularly during the presidency of Barack Obama); Limbaugh also coins his own nicknames for various people in the news. Examples include: :\\"Calypso Louie\\" (Limbaugh's nickname for Louis Farrakhan, a play on his early career in calypso music); :\\"Chuck You Schumer\\" (Limbaugh's nickname for current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer). An obvious allusion to a certain common expletive phrase, trading on Schumer‚Äôs rabidly anti-Trump attitude, statements and actions.) :\\"David 'Rodham' Gergen\\" (his nickname for David Gergen, Presidential adviser to Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush and Clinton, and now a CNN commentator); :\\"Debbie Blabbermouth Schultz\\" (nickname for the Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz :\\"Dick Turban\\" (the Democratic U.S. Senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin) :\\"Dingy Harry\\" (nickname for the former Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, analogous to Dirty Harry); :\\"F. Chuck Todd\\" (Limbaugh's nickname for Sunday political talk show host Chuck Todd). An allusion to author F. Scott Fitzgerald; it remains unstated what exactly the connection is to said author. Alternatively, the name could come from the rhyme F*** Chuck. :\\"Joe ‚ÄòPlugs‚Äô Bite Me\\" (Limbaugh's nickname for the former VP under the Obama Administration Joe Biden). \\"Plugs\\" comes from the fact that Biden has undergone an old-style hair transplant procedure. \\"Bite Me\\" is from former US General Stanley McChrystal's comments concerning Biden in 2010: \\"'Are you asking about Vice President Biden?' McChrystal says with a laugh. 'Who‚Äôs that?' 'Biden?' suggests a top adviser. 'Did you say: Bite me?'\\" :\\"Ruth Buzzi Ginsburg\\" (Limbaugh's nickname for the Liberal Progressive Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) :\\"Lindsey Grahamnesty\\" (Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a portmanteau referencing Graham's support for the \\"Amnesty Bill\\"); :\\"Michelle \\"My Belle\\" Obama\\", \\"Mooch-elle\\" (Michelle Obama, in a reference to the Beatles song \\"Michelle\\") :\\"Mr. Integrity\\" (his nickname for Robert Mueller, former Special Council for the DOJ). A sarcastic reference to how Democrats and Leftists viewed/praised Mueller at the outset of the Special Counsel probe, as contrasted with the fact of Mueller‚Äôs numerous real and apparent conflicts of interest. Said conflicts ironically would have caused a person with any actual ethical integrity to have turned down the role of Special Counsel from the outset. :\\"Struck Stroke Smirk\\" (his nickname for Peter Strzok, the disgraced former FBI agent fired from the Mueller investigation for bias.). This appears to be two failed attempts to pronounce his oddly-spelled surname, followed by a reference to his arrogant, smirking demeanor when testifying before Congress about his role in the Mueller investigation. :\\"The Fruit of Kaboom Bomber\\" (Umar Mutallab, a Muslim Nigerian citizen who attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear while aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on Christmas Day, 2009; a parody of Fruit of the Loom brand clothing); :\\"The Hilldebeast\\" (Limbaugh's occasionally-used nickname for former FLOTUS and SecState Hillary Clinton.). This refers to her beastly demeanor, remarks and attitudes towards Trump and all things Republican and conservative.}} :\\"The Loser\\" (1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis);Colford, Paul. \\"AM/FM Combat in the Morning\\", Newsday, December 21, 1988, pp. 13. :\\"Robert \\"KKK\\" Byrd (Robert Byrd, in a reference to the Robert Byrd's history with the Ku Klux Klan as both a member, recruiter, and top officer Exalted Cyclops) Over the years on The Rush Limbaugh Show, Limbaugh has established several nicknames with which he describes himself on the air. Others also ascribe nicknames or titles and credentials that Limbaugh then uses for entertainment or political satire. Often Limbaugh furthers his schtick of \\"making (himself) look good\\" by giving himself accolades with phrases praising his own performance. Examples include: \\" :\\"Titular Head of the Republican Party\\"; :\\"Doctor of Democracy\\" :\\"Harmless loveable little fuzzball and all around good/nice guy\\" (the nickname Limbaugh created for himself in response to the claim that he is the \\"most dangerous man in America\\"). Show history =Radio syndication= After several years of employment with the Kansas City Royals and in the music radio business, which included hosting a program at KMBZ in Kansas City, in 1984, Limbaugh started as a regular talk show host on AM radio station KFBK in Sacramento, California. He succeeded Morton Downey Jr. in the time slot. Based on his work in Sacramento, Limbaugh was signed to a contract by EFM Media Management, headed by former ABC Radio executive Edward McLaughlin. Limbaugh became syndicated on August 1, 1988 through EFM and his show was drawing five million listeners after two years of syndication. Lacking a name for the network during the early years, he coined the name \\"EIB (Excellence In Broadcasting) Network,\\" which has remained associated with the show even after joining an actual radio network. In 1997, Jacor Communications, a publicly traded company, acquired EFM. Later that year, Jacor merged with Premiere Radio Networks. In 1999, Jacor merged with Clear Channel Communications, which rebranded as iHeartMedia in 2014; Clear Channel and iHeart have maintained what is now branded as Premiere Networks as their syndication wing since acquiring it. In 2006, WBAL (1090 AM) in Baltimore, Maryland was the first station to drop Limbaugh's program and replace it with local programming; the current Baltimore affiliate is crosstown rival WCBM (680 AM). Limbaugh and Clear Channel signed an eight- year, $400 million contract extension on July 2, 2008. He signed a new contract for four additional years in a deal announced August 2, 2016, after Limbaugh publicly contemplated retirement. Limbaugh is believed to have taken a pay cut to remain on the air after advertisers pulled funding in response to boycotts around his criticism of Sandra Fluke and industry-wide advertising declines. Limbaugh renewed his agreement with Premiere through 2024 in a deal announced January 5, 2020. Dan's Bake Sale The initial idea for Dan's Bake Sale was conceived on The Rush Limbaugh Show in 1993. One caller, \\"Dan\\" from Fort Collins, Colorado, told Rush Limbaugh that he was photocopying a coworker's subscription to the Limbaugh Letter, Rush's monthly magazine that covers current events. The reason was that Dan's wife was not a fan of the show, and would not allocate the funds needed from the family budget to subscribe to the Letter. Limbaugh light-heartedly informed Dan that he disapproves his photocopying printed material, and offhandedly suggested that Dan organize a bake sale to raise funds for a subscription, spoofing then- recent bake sales to raise funds to reduce the national debt. After Dan's call ended, the next caller to the show stated that he felt Rush was a bit harsh, and that he intended to attend Dan's Bake Sale. Rush again dismissed the topic. The next caller stated that he would like to attend Dan's Bake Sale. Rush repeatedly announced they would take no more \\"bake sale\\" calls but the gig was on and everyone calling in for the next week or so put in a plug for Dan's Bake Sale. Limbaugh never seriously proposed a Bake Sale and neither did \\"Dan.\\" But the landslide of support for Dan and his bake sale was on. Eventually, some 65,000 people from all over the United States and as far away as Australia showed up in Fort Collins for Dan's Bake Sale.YouTube - Rush Limbaugh: Dan's Bake Sale Jay Leno even made jokes about it on The Tonight Show. Limbaugh attended, and had a brief presentation, giving Dan his first issue of his subscription. Dan considered making it an annual event, but agreed with Limbaugh's assessment that the original just could never again be replicated. Controversial incidents =Armed Forces Radio controversy= On May 26, 2004, the article \\"Rush's Forced Conscripts\\" appeared on the online news and opinion magazine Salon.com.Rush's forced conscripts - Salon.com The article discussed the controversy surrounding the fact that American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS), (which describes itself as \\"[providing] stateside radio and television programming, 'a touch of home', to U.S. service men and women, DoD civilians, and their families serving outside the continental United States\\"), carries the first hour of Limbaugh's show. Melvin Russell, director of AFRTS, defended Limbaugh's presence, by pointing to Limbaugh's high ratings in the US: \\"We look at the most popular shows broadcast here in the United States and try to mirror that. [Limbaugh] is the No. 1 talk show host in the States; there's no question about that. Because of that we provide him on our service.\\" In addition, AFRTS produced a ballot of radio and television shows asking troops worldwide, \\"Who do you want that we don't at present carry?\\" The Rush Limbaugh Show was not listed on the ballot, but won the vote as a write-in by the troops. A later poll by Lund Media Research found that a majority of soldiers preferred that talk show programs be replaced by hip hop and rap stations, bringing into question the future of content such as the Rush Limbaugh Show on AFRTS.Future military radio menu could be more pop, less talk  Stars and Stripes Critics have pointed out that other programs, such as the eight-million listener per week Howard Stern Show, are absent from AFRTS. (This statement was made before Stern left for satellite radio in 2006.) Other claims‚Äîfor example, that there is no political counterbalance to Limbaugh on AFRTS‚Äîhave been rebutted by Byron York, a columnist for the predominantly conservative National Review: \\"American military men and women abroad have access, for example, to the talk show of liberal host Diane Rehm ... Jim Hightower and CBS News anchorman Dan Rather.\\" Another possible political counterbalance to Limbaugh is Harry Shearer, who emphasizes his presence on AFRTS at the end of every episode of his satirical Le Show. On June 14, 2004, U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) introduced an amendment to the 2004 Defense Authorization bill that called for AFRTS to fulfill its stated goal of providing political balance in its news and public affairs programming. The amendment passed unanimously in the Senate. Limbaugh responded by calling the move \\"censorship\\". On his June 17 radio show, he commented that: \\"This is a United States senator [Tom Harkin] amending the Defense appropriations bill with the intent being to get this program‚Äîonly one hour of which is carried on Armed Forces Radio‚Äîstripped from that network.\\" The amendment never became law. As of 2005, the first hour of Limbaugh's show is still on AFRTS. Limbaugh visited US forces in Afghanistan in 2005. This treatment of The Rush Limbaugh Show proved to set a precedent for Congressional debate on AFRTS content. The Ed Schultz show, a liberal talk radio show with over one million listeners a week, was originally scheduled to be broadcast on AFRTS on October 17, 2005. It was subsequently pulled, with some alleging political motivation, which was later debated in Congress. A few weeks after this debate, AFRTS added Schultz to the line-up along with other talk show hosts: Al Franken and Sean Hannity. =Michael J. Fox controversy= On the October 23, 2006, broadcast of his radio show, Limbaugh imitated on the \\"DittoCam\\" (the webcam for Web site subscribers to see him on the air) the physical symptoms actor Michael J. Fox showed in a television commercial raising awareness of Parkinson's disease.Election 2004  Pa. Sen. Specter Focuses on Stem Cell Support To Attract Moderate Voters, Distances Himself From Bush in Re-Election Campaign Henry J. Kaiser Family FoundationMichael J.

Fox. Either he didn't take his medication or he's acting.\\"\\"Rush Limbaugh On the Offensive Against Ad With Michael J. Fox\\", Washington Post. Retrieved November 1, 2006. Three days later, on October 26, Limbaugh denied that he was ridiculing Fox, stating that, after seeing Fox without his medication, \\"I [was] stunned because I [had] never seen Michael J. Fox that way.\\" Limbaugh said that he was \\"mov[ing] around like [Fox] does, but never once was I making fun of him. I was trying to illustrate for my audience watching on the Dittocam what I had seen.\\"Rush Limbaugh website, transcript for 26 OCT 2006 broadcast Accessed: September 8, 2010. Fox later appeared on CBS with Katie Couric and said he was actually dyskinesic at the time, a condition that results from overmedication. However, Fox has admitted that he has, at times, deliberately not taken his medication‚Äîsuch as in an appearance the U.S. Senate‚Äîin order, he claimed, to demonstrate the effects of Parkinson's disease. During Limbaugh's October 26, 2006 show he said, in a discussion with a caller, \\"[I]n his own book [Lucky Man: A Memoir], he has written in chapter eight that before Senate committees he goes off the medication so that people can see the ravages of the disease.\\" =\\"Barack the Magic Negro\\" parody= On March 19, 2007, Limbaugh referred to a Los Angeles Times editorial by David Ehrenstein which claimed that Barack Obama was filling the role of the \\"magic negro\\", and that this explained his appeal to voters. Limbaugh then later played a song by Paul Shanklin entitled \\"Barack the Magic Negro,\\" sung to the tune of \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\". =Phony soldiers controversy= During the September 26, 2007, broadcast of Limbaugh's radio show, Limbaugh used the term \\"phony soldiers\\" when speaking to a caller who had questioned if the previous caller was really a soldier.http://news.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/view.bg?articleid=1034890 The caller, saying he was currently serving in the Army for 14 years, said, \\"They never talk to real soldiers. They like to pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and spout to the media.\\" Limbaugh interrupted, \\"The phony soldiers.\\" The caller continued, \\"The phony soldiers. If you talk to a real soldier, they are proud to serve. They want to be over in Iraq. They understand their sacrifice, and they're willing to sacrifice for their country.\\"[The Rush Limbaugh Show, Transcript] Several minutes later, after the caller had hung up, Limbaugh read from the AP story describing the story of Jesse Macbeth. Macbeth joined the Army but did not complete basic training, yet falsely claimed in alternative media interviews that he and his unit routinely committed war crimes in Iraq.http://www.peacefilms.org/index.html \\"Jessie Macbeth: Former Army Ranger and Iraq War Veteran\\" video, peacefilms.org, retrieved May 23, 2006 (inactive as of May 24, 2006) On June 7, 2007, Macbeth pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and was sentenced to five months in jail and three years probation.Seattle Times ‚Äì Man who lied about actions in Iraq admits faking formsSeattle Post Intellegencer ‚Äì Poster soldier for anti-war movement was a fake Media Matters noted Limbaugh's use of the term \\"phony soldiers\\" in an article on their website.

Limbaugh said that he allowed the caller to continue down that tangent while, off mic, he searched for the commentary on Jesse Macbeth to present to his audience, thus accounting for the delay. The unedited transcript of the radio show in question can be found on Rush Limbaugh's website. =Comments on Obama's policies= On January 16, 2009, Limbaugh read a letter on his radio show that he had received a request from a national print outlet: ... \\"If you could send us 400 words on your hope for the Obama presidency, we need it by Monday night, that would be ideal.\\" He responded, \\"I don't need 400 words, I need four: I hope he fails.\\" He explained that he didn't want \\"absorption of as much of the private sector by the US government as possible, from the banking business, to the mortgage industry, the automobile business, to health care. I do not want the government in charge of all of these things. I don't want this to work.\\" He continued, \\"What is unfair about my saying I hope liberalism fails? Liberalism is our problem. Liberalism is what's gotten us dangerously close to the precipice here.\\" Limbaugh later said that he wants to see Obama's policies fail, not the man himself. Speaking of Obama, Limbaugh said, \\"He's my president, he's a human being, and his ideas and policies are what count for me.\\" =\\"Leader of Republican Party\\"= Limbaugh was the keynote speaker at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference; his speech attracted widespread attention. On March 1, 2009, CBS's Face the Nation asked White House Chief Of Staff Rahm Emanuel who he thought represented the Republican Party; Emanuel named Limbaugh as his choice.Transcript: Rahm Emanuel on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄòFace the Nation‚Äô , CQ Politics, March 1, 2009Limbaugh the Leader?

Limbaugh stated he would not want to run the RNC in its \\"sad sack state\\". On March 2, 2009, Limbaugh responded to Emanuel, and on March 4, 2009, Limbaugh challenged President Barack Obama to a debate on his radio program. Limbaugh offered to pay all of Obama's expenses including travel, food, lodging, and security.Rush to the President: Debate Me, Rush Limbaugh transcript, March 4, 2009 On March 6, Limbaugh told Byron York of the Washington Examiner that his ratings for his radio show had significantly increased since he had begun criticizing the Obama Administration.Limbaugh: My Ratings are Way, Way Up, Washington Examiner, March 6, 2009 =Comments regarding Sandra Fluke= On February 29, 2012, Limbaugh said that Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown University law student and women's rights activist, supposedly was a \\"slut\\" and a \\"prostitute\\" on his radio show, in response to testimony that Fluke gave to Congressional Democrats in favor of requiring contraception to be included in insurance provided by employers, including religiously affiliated organizations that object to its usage. The negative response included boycott campaigns by social media groups pressuring the show's advertisers; as of March 8, up to forty-five advertisers had withdrawn or suspended their advertising on the show, and two radio stations, KPUA in Hilo, Hawaii, and WBEC in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, announced they would no longer broadcast the show. In March 2012, social media boycott promoters claimed that an additional 96 advertisers had dropped the show, but the Washington Post later reported that this was just a regular quarterly notice , not specific to the controversy.John Avlon, \\"Rush Limbaugh Scandal Proves Contagious for Talk-Radio Advertisers\\" The Daily Beast Mar 10, 2012 Premiere responded to the boycott campaigns with an aggressive campaign to circumvent the traditional advertising agencies and account executives to solicit new advertisers, not just for Limbaugh but for its other talk properties as well; Premiere declared success with this strategy in June 2013, at which point many of the advertisers had long since returned and those that had not had been replaced.Weinger, Mackenzie (June 6, 2013). Distributor: Rush Limbaugh doing 'very well'. Politico. Retrieved June 6, 2013. Competing networks Cumulus Media and Dial Global both blamed the controversy for advertising losses at their networks; in Cumulus's case, it was also a factor in the company's decision to drop Limbaugh from all of their stations (including several of Limbaugh's top-10 market affiliates, most of which were former ABC owned-and- operated stations) when the company's bulk carriage contract with Limbaugh expired at the end of 2013.Byers, Dylan (May 5, 2013).

The show has also been dropped by other stations such as WRKO in Boston and KFI in Los Angeles resulting it in being carried by weaker stations in major markets.http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/is-rush-limbaugh-in- trouble-talk-radio-213914#ixzz4FnOUTQjg Operation Chaos In late February 2008, Limbaugh announced \\"Operation Chaos,\\" a political call to action with the initial plan to have voters of the Republican Party temporarily cross over to vote in the Democratic primary and vote for Hillary Clinton, who at the time was in the midst of losing eleven straight primary contests to Barack Obama. Limbaugh has also cited the open primary process in the early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, which allowed independent voters to cross over into the Republican primaries to choose John McCain over more conservative candidates (such as Fred Thompson), as an inspiration. At the point in which Limbaugh announced his gambit, Obama had seemed on the verge of clinching the Democratic nomination.RealClearPolitics - HorseRaceBlog - Is This Race Over? However, Clinton subsequently won the Ohio primary and the Texas primary (while losing the Texas caucus and the overall delegate split) with large pluralities from rural counties; thus reemerging as a competitive opponent in the race.RealClearPolitics - HorseRaceBlog - Obama, Small Town Whites, and the Super Delegates On April 29, 2008 Limbaugh declared an \\"operational pause\\" in Operation Chaos, saying that Obama's defeat in the 2008 Pennsylvania primary and fallout from statements from Obama ally Reverend Jeremiah Wright could have damaged his campaign to the extent superdelegates would shift to Clinton's side.Rush Calls Operation Chaos Pause Determining Obama had weathered that storm, Limbaugh lifted the pause the next day and renewed his call for his listeners to vote for Clinton in the upcoming Indiana and North Carolina primaries.WISH-ful Thinking in Indianapolis; Operational Pause Officially Lifted Obama won the North Carolina primary but was narrowly defeated in Indiana, where Clinton won decisively in rural counties that normally vote Republican in presidential elections. The overall legality of Operation Chaos in several states, including Ohio and Indiana, is disputed. In Ohio, new party members are required to sign a pledge of loyalty to the party they join for a minimum of one year, making participation in \\"Operation Chaos\\" a possible felony (election falsification) in that state. However, the state attorney general there refused to press charges on anyone, saying that it would be nearly impossible to enforce because of difficulties proving voter intent and concerns that a loyalty oath would violate freedom of association.Niquette, Mark. Limbaugh safe from voter-fraud charges. The Columbus Dispatch. 28 March 2008. By 2020, the name \\"Operation Chaos\\" had become associated enough with presidential party raiding that South Carolina Republicans seeking to disrupt that state's Democratic presidential primary recycled the name for their own efforts. Limbaugh did not endorse or address the South Carolina efforts.Ellis, Mike (February 24, 2020). 'Operation Chaos:' Republican voters aim to skew SC Democratic primary. The Greenville News via MSN.

PICAXE devices are essentially Microchip PIC devices, with pre-programmed firmware that enables bootloading of code directly from a PC, simplifying hobbyist embedded development (not unlike the Arduino and Parallax BASIC Stamp systems). PICAXE devices have been produced by Revolution Education (Rev-Ed) since 1999. Hardware There are currently six (6) PICAXE variants of differing pin counts (8-14-18-20-28-40) and are available as DIL and SMD. PICAXE microcontrollers are pre-programmed with an interpreter similar to the BASIC Stamp but using internal EEPROM instead, thus reducing cost. This also allows downloads to be made with a simple serial connection which eliminates the need for a PIC programmer. PICAXE is programmed using an RS-232 serial cable or a USB cable which connects a computer to the download circuit, which normally uses a 3.5 mm jack and two resistors. =Programming language= PICAXE microcontrollers are programmed using BASIC. The PICAXE interpreter features bit-banged communications: * Serial (asynchronous serial) * SPI (synchronous serial) * Infrared (using a 38 kHz carrier, seven data bits and five ID bits) * One-wire The \\"readtemp\\" command reads the temperature from a DS18B20 temperature sensor and converts it into Celsius. All current PICAXEs have commands for using hardware features of the underlying PIC microcontrollers: * Hardware asynchronous serial * Hardware synchronous serial * Hardware PWM * DAC * ADC * SR Latch * Timers (two on X2/X1 parts which have settable intervals, only one on M2 parts with a fixed interval, older parts have none) * Comparators * Internal temperature measurement =Program space= All current PICAXE chips have at least 2048 bytes of on board program memory available for user programs: * 08M2 - 2048 bytes * 14M2 - 2048 * 18M2+ - 2048 * 20M2 - 2048 * 20X2 - 4096 * 28X1 - 4096 * 40X1 - 4096 * 28X2 - 4096 per slot with four slots for a total of 16 KiB * 40X2 - 4096 per slot with four slots for a total of 16 KiB =Clock speeds= The default clock speed for all M2 and X1 parts is 4 MHz and for the X2 parts is 8 MHz. The SETFREQ command allows speeds from 31 kHz up to 8 MHz for X1 parts, 31 kHz up to 32 MHz for M2 parts and 31 kHz up to 16 MHz for X2 parts (up to 64 MHz for the 20X2) using the internal resonator. An external resonator can be used with the X1 parts for from 4 MHz to 20 MHz clock speeds and with the X2 parts for 16 MHz to 64 MHz clock speeds. =Project boards= Project boards for different applications are sold by Rev-Ed which contain the PICAXE, download circuit and may also contain a prototyping area or high power output drivers. Software Revolution Education develop software for writing programs for PICAXE. =PICAXE Programming Editor= PICAXE Programming Editor is a Windows-only IDE for writing PICAXE programs in BASIC code or a simple flowchart. PICAXE Programming Editor features: * source code colour syntax highlighting * auto indentation * syntax check and program download * code explorer to shown variable, label and constant values * full on screen simulation with animated chips and line by line code highlighting * simulation breakpoints by line number and variable value * debug and serial terminal windows * AXE027 download cable testing and port identification tools * various testing tools such as the analogue calibration wizard * various code generation wizards (pwmout, tune, RTC setting, etc.) =AXEpad= AXEpad is a cross-platform application recommended for Linux and Mac users. It lacks some of Programming Editor's wizards, simulation and MDI. =Logicator for PICAXE= Logicator is an easy to use shareware flowcharting program. The Logicator web page is out of date as the free version does support all commands but shows nag screens. PICAXE Programming Editor 6, the successor to PICAXE Programming Editor 5, has Logicator flowcharting merged into it so separate Logicator software is no longer required. Like PICAXE Programming Editor 5, PICAXE Programming Editor 6 is freeware. Third-party software =Yenka= Yenka is a program developed by Crocodile Clips Ltd which has flowcharts and simulation. =Others= Many companies and organizations have put out their own editors with special features. Some include language translators or serial connectors, so there is a wide variety of consoles to be used. Support Support is available at the Technical Support section of the PICAXE website and at the PICAXE Forum. The PICAXE Forum has a finished projects section where completed projects and PICAXE programs are posted, plus there is a similar section on the PICAXE website.

It was the first feature-film to be directed by Luc Besson, and also features Jean Reno's first prominent role. Music for the film was composed by √âric Serra. The film was the first of many collaborations between Besson, Reno and Serra. A dark vision of post-apocalyptic survival, the film was shot in black and white and contains only two words of dialogue. It depicts a world where people have been rendered mute by some unknown incident. Plot The film opens to a shot of an abandoned office, where the main character (Pierre Jolivet), who is only identified as 'The Man' in the end credits, is having intercourse with a sex doll. The Man is then seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles, but returns to his dwelling empty handed, where he works on building a makeshift aircraft. The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in, which is surrounded by a desert wasteland. A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. The Man, who has been observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery. Survivors pursue The Man, though he is able to escape in his now completed aircraft. 'The Brute' (Jean Reno) is seen approaching a hospital with a box containing canned food. The Brute rings a bell, and 'The Doctor' (Jean Bouise), instructs him to place the canned goods on the ground and back away from the door. The Doctor then takes the goods and closes the door before The Brute can get inside. The Man's aircraft crash lands at night. The following morning he continues on foot. The Brute returns to the hospital with a new box of items, though this time he constructs a device that will keep the door open long enough for him to enter the building. The plan works, however, once back inside the building The Doctor pulls a lever which closes a secondary iron bar gate preventing The Brute from entering. The Man finds an abandoned bar, gets himself heavily intoxicated and passes out. When he awakes, he ventures outside where he is amazed that it is raining fish. While searching for a way to cook the fish, The Man encounters The Brute. A fight ensues; the Brute gains the upper hand though The Man is able to escape. The Man, now badly injured, wanders around until he finds The Doctor. The Doctor treats The Man and cooks him some fish. The Doctor inhales a form of gas that allows him to, with some difficulty, say a single word: Bonjour. The Man also takes the gas and is able to reply with the same word. Both are ecstatic about being able to speak. The Man and the Doctor bond over table tennis and painting, before The Man ventures outside into a sandstorm to retrieve a painting he found in the bar. The Brute, who has been living in the bar, returns and notices the painting is missing. The Doctor prepares some food and blindfolds The Man. He leads The Man to a part of the hospital where a woman is kept, and gives her the food. The Brute sets fire to the front door of the hospital, though The Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames. The Man and The Doctor go to bring food to the woman again, and The Man gives her a wrapped gift. They then catch The Brute attempting to saw through the iron bar gate, though are able to scare him off. The Doctor and The Man prepare food for the woman, yet this time The Doctor permits the man to not be blindfolded, and encourages him to comb his hair. Meanwhile, it is revealed that The Brute has breached the iron gate to the hospital. The Doctor is killed on the way to the woman when chunks of rock rain down from the sky. The Man, who does not know how to find the woman without The Doctor, attempts to locate her, though he is confronted by The Brute. A fight ensues, with The Man eventually killing The Brute. The Man then locates the woman's room, though is devastated when he discovers that The Brute had already killed her. The Man repairs his aircraft, and flies back to the original survivors he encountered. He kills their new leader and frees The Dwarf. The Dwarf shows the Man where The Captain keeps his concubine (Christiane Kr√ºger). The Man greets her with a warm smile, which she returns. Themes Writing in the book The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward, director of Film Studies at the University of Exeter, considered Le Dernier Combat and The Fifth Element to be Besson's two film's which focus on the theme of environmental damage, as waste and pollution are visible throughout both films. Capitalism was also considered to be a theme; consumer commodities were said to be signs of death, such as the abandoned cars in the desert and the floating washing machines in a flooded abandoned factory. Production Besson described the film as an \\"imaginary excursion\\", stating he got the inspiration for the film from an abandoned cinema he saw in Paris. Thinking of all the other abandoned buildings there must be in Paris, Besson decided to create a world where all these places were together, and combined this idea with a previous suggestion that he make a feature-length version of his 1981 debut short film, L'Avant Dernier. Le Dernier Combat was primarily filmed in Paris, with scenes depicted as being in the desert filmed in Tunisia. Locations for filming in Paris included a former √âlectricit√© de France building that was demolished the day after filming was completed, and the derelict area where the Biblioth√®que nationale de France was later constructed. The film was shot in black and white and contains only two words of dialogue. Release and reception Le Dernier Combat was distributed in France on 6 April 1983. The film attracted 236,189 viewers at the French box office, grossing the equivalent of $1.7 million. Le Dernier Combat was released in the United States in June 1984. Time Out gave a favourable review, calling the film a \\"welcome addition to the post-holocaust barbarism [film] boom.\\" Steve Macfarlane from Not Coming to a Theater Near You gave a moderately positive review, stating \\"While the film‚Äôs heart is syrupy- sentimental (who‚Äôs shocked?), its surfaces are clean, incremental, reverently silent‚Äîappropriate, given that ... humankind has lost its ability to speak.\\" Janet Maslin from The New York Times called it \\"a bravura first film, using the simplest means, yet managing to incorporate humor, pathos, suspense and even a well-articulated definition of basic human needs.\\" Dave Kehr from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review, stating: \\"The absence of dialogue ... is a cleverly executed stunt, but it is also an effective alibi for a technically proficient filmmaker who really has nothing to say. Another John Carpenter is born, which is by no means a bad thing.\\" Accolades Le Dernier Combat won Best Film, Best Director and the Audience Jury Award at Fantasporto in 1984. It also won Best Film and Best Director at the 1983 Sitges Film Festival, and won the Critic's Prize at the 1983 Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival. It was nominated for Best First Work at the 1984 C√©sar Awards. Note: Choose '1984' from the drop-down box. Home media Adam Tyner from DVD Talk gave a positive review of the DVD release in August 2001, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars for video, audio and content, though awarding it 0 stars for extras, noting the only extras were trailers for other films. The same DVD was released alongside Besson's 1997 film, The Fifth Element as a 'Luc Besson 2-pack'. Upon reviewing the 2-pack in April 2003, Ron Epstein from DVD Talk gave the Le Dernier Combat DVD 3¬Ω out of 5 for video, audio and content, though also giving it 0 stars for extras.

Marie Henriette was one of five children from the marriage of Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary, and Duchess Maria Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg. Marie Henriette was a cousin of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, and granddaughter of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, through her father. She was also first cousin to the future Queen Mary of the United Kingdom through her mother. Marriage and issue One day before her 17th birthday, she married 18-year-old Prince Leopold of Belgium, the heir to the throne, on 22 August 1853. Leopold was the second-surviving son of Leopold I of Belgium and his French wife, Louise of Orl√©ans; Marie Henriette was the sister-in-law of Charlotte of Belgium, future Empress of Mexico and a cousin by marriage to Victoria of the United Kingdom and Maria II of Portugal. The marriage was arranged to strengthen the status of the Belgian Monarchy. As the former Protestant monarch of a newly established monarchy, the Belgian king wished his son to marry a member from a Roman Catholic and prestigious dynasty, and the name Habsburg was one of her more important qualities. Henriette was a vivid and energetic person interested in riding. Pauline de Metternich wrote that theirs was a marriage \\"between a stable-boy and a nun, and by nun I mean the Duke of Brabant\\". Henriette is said to have had a terrible temperament. The marriage became unhappy, and the couple lived more or less separate lives. She became queen in 1865. After the death of their son in 1869, the couple separated completely after having made a last attempt to have another son, which, however, resulted in their daughter Clementine. She gave her daughters a very strict upbringing. Her main interest was in her Hungarian horses. She lived most of her life unhappy and discontented. In 1895 she retreated to Spa; her youngest daughter Clementine replaced her as first lady at the Court in Brussels for the remainder of her husband's life. Marie Henriette died at the H√¥tel du Midi in Spa; she had bought the house in 1895 after separating with her husband. She was buried in the Royal Crypt at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels. Her husband later married (though illegally under Belgian law) his mistress Caroline Delacroix.

First samples from the Moon being delivered to LRL in 1969 The Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL) was a facility at NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (Building 37) that was constructed to quarantine astronauts and material brought back from the Moon during the Apollo program to mitigate the risk of back-contamination. After recovery at sea, crews from Apollo 11, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 walked from their helicopter to the Mobile Quarantine Facility on the deck of an aircraft carrier and were brought to the LRL for quarantine. Samples of rock and regolith that the astronauts collected and brought back were flown directly to the LRL and initially analyzed in glovebox vacuum chambers. :::File:NASA- Houston LRL-installation.png The quarantine requirement was dropped beginning with Apollo 15 and the LRL was used for study, distribution and safe storage of the lunar samples. Between 1969 and 1972, six Apollo space flight missions brought back 382 kilograms (842 pounds) of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand and dust from the lunar surface. The six space flights returned 2200 separate samples from six different exploration sites on the lunar surface. Other lunar samples were returned to Earth by three automated Soviet spacecraft, Luna 16 in 1970, Luna 20 in 1972, and Luna 24 in 1976, which returned samples totaling 300 grams (approximately 3/4 pound). In 1976, a portion of the samples were moved to Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas for second-site storage. In 1979, a Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility was built to serve as the chief repository for the Apollo samples. It was constructed to provide permanent storage of the lunar sample collection in a physically secure and non-contaminating environment. The facility consists of storage vaults for the samples, laboratories for sample preparation and study, a vault for sample data and records, and machinery to supply nitrogen to the cabinets in which the samples are stored and processed. The Lunar Receiving Laboratory building was later occupied by the Life Sciences division, contained biomedical and environment labs, and was used for experiments involving human adaptation to microgravity. As of September 25, 2019, reports from NASA state that the Lunar Receiving Laboratory has not been used for two years and is slated to be demolished.

With 4 million members, it is the third largest Red Cross society in the world. The German Red Cross offers a wide range of services within and outside Germany. GRC provides 52 hospitals, care for the elderly (over 500 nursing homes and a network of ambulant nursing care for the elderly covering all over the country), care for children and youth (i.e. 1.300 kindergartens, full range of social services for children). GRC also provides 75% of the blood supply in Germany as well as 60% of the emergency medical services in Germany, as well as first aid training. GRC headquarters provides international humanitarian aid (disaster management and development assistance) in over 50 countries in the world.  Voluntary societies of the German Red Cross  The majority of active voluntary Red Cross members are part of the five voluntary societies of the German Red Cross. *Bereitschaften (medical service units, about 160,000 members) *Bergwacht (mountain rescue service) *Wasserwacht (lifeguard service, about 130,000 members) *Sozialarbeit (welfare work) *Jugendrotkreuz (Red Cross Youth) History =Formation and early years= General Curt von Pfuel, Chairman of the Central Committee of the German National Red Cross during WW I. General von Pfuel, Chairman of the Central Committee of the German National Red Cross Local example before 1919 Instituted in 1864 by Dr. Aaron Silverman of the Charit√© hospital of Berlin, the German Red Cross was a voluntary civil assistance organization that was officially acknowledged by the Geneva Convention in 1929. General Curt W. von Pfuel was the Chairman of the Central Committee of the German National Red Cross during the Great War.German Red Cross recruitment war poster One of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles prevented the DRK from having any involvement in military matters. As a result, during the Weimar Republic under the leadership of Joachim von Winterfeldt-Mencken, the DRK became a national organization focusing on social welfare. =Nazi Germany era= In April 1933 the Nazi Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick made it clear to Winterfeldt- Mencken that this policy would no longer apply; instead, the DRK would be expected to play its part in supporting the armed forces in any future conflict. Shortly after this the DRK was informed that the head of the SA Medical Corps, Dr. Paul Hocheisen had been given responsibility for voluntary nursing organizations. On 11 June 1933 Frick was invited to speak at the Red Cross Day. He declared: \\"The Red Cross is something like the conscience of the nation. ... Together with the nation, the Red Cross is ready to commit all its strength for the high goals of our leader, Adolf Hitler\\". The DRK was quick to respond to the changed circumstances, indeed Winterfeldt-Mencken had always been opposed to the system of parliamentary democracy. The Workers' Samaritan League, a left-wing humanitarian organization, had always been an unwelcome competitor to the DRK. Hocheisen very quickly arranged that it should be taken over by the DRK. Similarly, the DRK moved quickly to rid itself of left-wing members, and in June 1933 it also decided that the Nazi \\"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\\" should be applied and dismissed its Jewish employees. However the DRK was still a member of the Red Cross movement, and Germany remained a signatory to the Geneva Convention, so it was not possible for them to apply the same level of \\"Gleichschaltung\\" to the DRK as it was to other organizations. The attitude of the ICRC towards the DRK's exclusion of the Jews was later expressed in a letter written by Max Huber in 1939. According to him, the primary obligation of neutral treatment as foreseen in the Geneva Convention was to the victims of war, and not to the helpers. He argued that as it was impossible to prescribe rules which were in conflict with the laws of a country, it was better to take a flexible approach than to risk the break-up of the universal Red Cross movement. Despite Winterfeldt-Mencken's professions of loyalty to the regime, they were not reciprocated and a replacement was sought. President Hindenburg was able to influence the decision, and selected Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who was Queen Victoria's grandson, rather than Hocheisen. Charles Edward had moved from England to Germany at the age of 15, had subsequently served as a general in the German army in the First World War, and had long supported right-wing movements in general, and Hitler in particular. He was already honorary president of the National Socialist Motor Corps. Charles Edward became President of the DRK in December 1933, while Hocheisen became his deputy. Not unsurprisingly, they did not work well together. There followed a typically Nazi power struggle, in which Hocheisen was eventually able to assert his authority ‚Äì only to be ousted by the top SS doctor Ernst-Robert Grawitz at the start of 1937. At the end of 1938 the German Red Cross officially came under the control of the Ministry of the Interior's Social Welfare Organization, becoming de facto a Nazi entity, led by Grawitz in the role of 'acting president', with Oswald Pohl as chairman of the board of administration. By this stage there was no doubt about who was in charge, though Charles Edward remained in his post until 1945. As he was related to European royalty and spoke good English, he was a useful figurehead for the DRK, but Grawitz was different ‚Äì he would turn up to International Red Cross meetings in his SS uniform. Grawitz took a radical approach to his task. He introduced a hierarchical chain of command into the DRK, and arranged for a new large and imposing \\"representative\\"- presidential building to be constructed in Potsdam-Babelsberg, complete with a balcony from which speeches could be made. His ideal concept for the DRK was that of a \\"healthy structure which would fit itself organically into the laws of life in the National Socialist Third Reich\\". In the years after the Nazi takeover, as well as adopting Nazi salutes and symbols, the DRK introduced Nazi ideology into their education. Rescue teams were trained in military conduct, basic concepts of National Socialism, genetics, racial hygiene and demographic policy. More senior staff ‚Äì doctors, nurses and managers were educated in demographic policy, racial history, racial hygiene, the biology of inheritance and the foundations of genetics. As a preparation for war, the DRK focused on training people to deal with air raids and gas attacks and organised joint exercises with the police and the fire brigades. In the years 1939‚Äì1945 the German Red Cross was involved in the crimes against Jewish and Polish nation called as a Holocaust (contrary to Swedish and Swiss Red Cross actively involved in helping Jews and Poles during the whole Second World War). =Postwar era to present day= After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the Allied Military Government issued a special law outlawing the NSDAP and all of its branches. Known as \\"Law Number Five\\", this Denazification decree disbanded the DRK, like all organizations linked to the NSDAP. Social welfare organizations, including the German Red Cross, had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of both West Germany and the DDR. The German Red Cross in the Federal Republic was recognized by the International Committee of the Red Cross on 25 June 1952. In the German Democratic Republic the Deutsches Rotes Kreuz der DDR was established on 23 October 1952 and recognized by the International Red Cross on 9 November 1954. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) Red Cross issued a magazine named Deutsches Rotes Kreuz (German Red Cross). Albert Schweitzer became an exemplary figure. The DDR Red Cross's status as a separate entity ended on 1 January 1991, when it was merged with the German Red Cross of the Federal Republic.

Formed in 1988 by Tahrah Cohen and Joe Pascarell, the band has performed many shows around the world. The Machine began as a cover band who played gigs local to the Rockland County, NY area and did not play Pink Floyd Music exclusively. In 1989, they were approached by a talent agent and it was suggested that they perform full-time. They seemed to garner such a delighted response from their audiences that the band's reputation continued to grow and soon they became one of the forerunners of the tribute band phenomenon. The band has played thousands of shows worldwide and has seen several lineup changes. The most significant change came in December of 2012 when Pascarell left the band for the second time (Pascarell also left the band in the year 2000 resulting in a 9 month hiatus).

H√©ctor Elizondo, Nathan Lane and Kate Nelligan appeared in supporting roles. The original score was composed by Marvin Hamlisch. The screenplay for Frankie and Johnny was adapted by Terrence McNally from his own off-Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune (1987), which featured F. Murray Abraham and Kathy Bates. The most notable alteration in the film was the addition of several supporting characters and various locations; in the original play, only the two eponymous characters appeared onstage, and the entire drama took place in one apartment. The title is a reference to the traditional American popular song \\"Frankie and Johnny\\", first published in 1904, which tells the story of a woman who finds her man making love to another woman and shoots him dead. The film received generally favourable reviews but was disappointing at the box office, grossing $67 million with a $29 million budget. Plot An emotionally scarred waitress named Frankie attends her godson's baptism in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, a middle-aged man named Johnny is released from prison. Frankie returns home to New York City to her job waitressing at the Apollo Cafe. The owner, Nick, sends her co-worker Helen home early after she complains of dizziness. Johnny arrives looking for work and Nick hires him as a short-order cook despite his criminal record. After work, Frankie returns home to her apartment to find a stranger, Bobby, installing shelves, but he is revealed to be the boyfriend of her friend and neighbor, Tim. That night, Johnny solicits a prostitute, but just asks her to lay clothed in bed with him. The next day, Nick announces to his staff that Helen has been hospitalized. Frankie and her co-worker Cora visit an unconscious Helen and share their fears of dying alone like her. The next day, after helping a man who had an epileptic seizure, Johnny asks Frankie out on a date, but she refuses. Helen dies and Frankie, Cora, and fellow waitress Nedda are surprised to see Johnny at her funeral. Back at work, Johnny asks Frankie out again. After she refuses again, he has a one-night stand with Cora, which she shares the details of with Frankie and Nedda. Weeks pass, and Johnny asks Frankie to be his date at a co-worker's going-away party, but she again refuses. He shows up at her apartment anyway, where Bobby and Tim help Frankie decide what to wear. At the party, Johnny attempts to convince Frankie that they are a good match. After the party, he buys her a flower and convinces her to take him back to her apartment, where they spend an intimate night together. Now convinced that they are meant to be together, Johnny shows up at her bowling night and professes his love to her. Frankie argues that he cannot love her after such a short period of time, and reveals that she cannot have children after Johnny mentions starting a family. Afterwards, Frankie avoids Johnny, not answering his phone calls and switching her shifts. However, Johnny switches his shifts too and they talk to each other. Johnny confesses that he is divorced and has two children who he hasn't seen since he got out of prison for check fraud. Frankie encourages him to see them, and she confesses that her last boyfriend cheated on her with her best friend. After work, Johnny walks Frankie to her apartment, where they discuss their lives and listen to \\"Clair de Lune\\". However, the intimacy makes Frankie uncomfortable and they argue. She asks him to leave, but before he does, he calls the radio station and asks them to play an encore of \\"Clair de Lune\\". Frankie confesses that a previous boyfriend had physically abused her, at one point causing her to have a miscarriage which made her unable to have children. Frankie invites Johnny to stay and they watch the sunrise together.

Reception Frankie and Johnny currently holds a score of 66% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews, indicating generally positive reviews. Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: \\"there hasn't been a sharper, sassier, more touching romantic comedy this year... there's no denying Marshall's expert timing. This is the director's best work yet... In its celebration of cautious optimism, Frankie and Johnny becomes the perfect love story for these troubled times.\\" Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote: \\"in the skillfully manipulative hands of Garry Marshall, who has directed from a screenplay by Mr. McNally that amounts to a complete revision, Frankie and Johnny has been reshaped into foolproof schmaltz. 'Foolproof' is the operative word... But somehow Mr. Marshall, Mr. McNally and their superb leading actors are able to retain the intimacy of their material. They also retain the story's fundamental wariness about romance, even when everything about Ms. Pfeiffer and Mr. Pacino has the audience wondering why they don't simply fall into each other's arms.\\" Rita Kempley in The Washington Post wrote: \\"In its odyssey from stage to screen, Frankie & Johnny has undergone a sunny metamorphosis from ugly ducklings' romance to candy-coated, blue-collar valentine.\\" Time Out summed it up thus: \\"Pacino wears a vest and bandanna and moons through the part. Pfeiffer plays dowdy. Marshall directs as if Marty had never happened.\\" Much attention was paid to the controversial casting choices of Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer, two actors perceived as \\"beautiful movie stars\\" with Hollywood glamour, cast to play \\"lonely little people struggling to find love,\\" originated by supposed \\"ordinary\\" actors Kenneth Welsh and Kathy Bates. Stephen Farber in Movieline wrote: \\"Michelle Pfeiffer gives a very adept and winning performance in Frankie & Johnny, but she's simply wrong for the part of a plain, world-weary waitress. While Pfeiffer has protested to interviewers that physical beauty cannot guarantee happiness, the fact remains that anyone as gorgeous as she is has a lot more options than someone who looks like Kathy Bates (who originated the role on stage). The star casting robs the material of some of its poignancy.\\" The Washington Post wrote that \\"casting Michelle Pfeiffer in a role written for Kathy Bates is going to have a definite effect on the story's dramatic weight. That's not to say that Pfeiffer isn't pfantastic or that this isn't the pfeel-good movie of the season. It's just ... well, imagine Kevin Costner as Marty.\\" Variety asserted that no one would \\"believe that Pfeiffer hasn't had a date since Ronald Reagan was president, and no matter how hard she tries to look plain, there is no disguising that she just gets more beautiful all the time.\\" However, some critics commended Pfeiffer for her performance, notably Rolling Stone, who called it \\"a triumph. She is among that rarefied group of actresses (Anjelica Huston, Meryl Streep) whose work keeps taking us by surprise. Her powerfully subtle acting can tickle the funny bone or pierce the heart with equally uncanny skill.\\" The New York Times wrote that \\"Ms. Pfeiffer's extraordinary beauty makes her fine-tuned, deeply persuasive performance as the tough and fearful Frankie that much more surprising.\\" Pacino also received critical praise. Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Pacino, whose recent work has been lugubrious (The Godfather Part III) or broad (Dick Tracy), shows a real flair for comic delicacy.\\" The New York Times wrote that \\"Mr. Pacino has not been this uncomplicatedly appealing since his Dog Day Afternoon days, and he makes Johnny's endless enterprise in wooing Frankie a delight. His scenes alone with Ms. Pfeiffer have a precision and honesty that keep the film's maudlin aspects at bay.\\" Variety, however, described him as \\"a warm, slobbering dog who can't leave people alone, Pacino's Johnny comes on real strong, and his pronounced neediness is too much at times.\\" Kate Nelligan was singled out for her supporting turn; The New York Times wrote that \\"Kate Nelligan, nearly unrecognizable, is outstandingly enjoyable as the gum-chewing, man-crazy one.\\" Rolling Stone thought that \\"seeing this Royal Shakespeare Company actress cut loose with this bold and brassy performance is one of the film's zippiest treats.\\" The film grossed $22.8 million in the United States and Canada and $44 million overseas for a worldwide gross of $67 million. Awards and honors Frankie and Johnny received a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film, along with Fried Green Tomatoes (1991), for its \\"fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and the issues that affect their lives.\\" Michelle Pfeiffer was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, but lost to Bette Midler in For The Boys (1991).

Whether the Arsiyah were a single tribe or composed of Muslims from a number of different tribes is unclear. Also unclear is their origin; many historians regard them as deriving from Khwarazm, but some scholars point to the fact that \\"As\\" is the Turkic term for Alans and believe that the Arsiyah were Alanic in origin. Other scholars derive the name from Iranian Auru≈°a (white).Golden 2007, p. 138, note 82. According to Muslim sources, the Arsiyah formed the core of the Khazar army and were extremely influential in Khazar politics, but these assertions may be designed to exaggerate the importance of the Muslim community in Khazaria. The Arsiyah did often act independently of their government. Part of the treaty binding them to Khazar service guaranteed that they would not be used to fight other Muslims. In 913, the Arsiyah ambushed a Varangian fleet that had been granted passage to the Caspian Sea by the Khazar government, wiping out thousands of Rus warriors. Notes References *Peter B.

History With the start of the Second Sino- Japanese War, there was a tremendous need for air transport capability by the Japanese military, which had traditionally drawn on the resources of the civilian national flag carrier, Japan Air Transport, for its charter requirements. As Japan Air Transport's capacity was limited, conflict arose between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy over priority, and the government saw the need for the creation of a single, national monopoly. The government bought a 50 percent share of Japan Air Transport, and renamed it the Dai Nippon K≈çk≈´ in December 1938. In the late 1930s, Dai Nippon K≈çk≈´ operated an extensive international network with a combination of foreign and domestic aircraft. The airline was linked with Manchukuo National Airways for routes in Chosen and Manchukuo, and also had routes in the Japanese occupied portions of mainland China.Timetable and route map, 1939 20th century timetable museum Internally, Dai Nippon K≈çk≈´ linked the Japanese home islands with the Kwantung Leased Territory, Korea, Taiwan, Karafuto, and Saipan and Palau in the South Seas Mandate. The airline served the west and central Pacific areas using converted military flying boats. The airline operated some longer charter flights, including flights to Iran and Italy in 1939, and had long-term plans to serve Europe through two routes, one passing through Manchuria and Central Asia and the other running from Bangkok through India and the Middle East. After the start of the Pacific War in 1942, the airline became completely government-owned and operated as two separate units under the control of the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy respectively.Routes development history etc. JCAL By 1943, the airline flew a circular military convoy route from Taiwan through the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and southern China.Flight schedule, 1943 20th century timetable museum Operations continued until the surrender of Japan in August 1945, despite heavy losses. Haneda Airport was seized by Allied forces in September, and the airline was formally disbanded in October.

All that now remains is the motte, which is referred to as Domen Las (traditionally meaning \\"green mound\\" in Welsh). History Aberdyfi Castle was founded by the Lord Rhys, Rhys ap Gruffydd in 1156, shortly after he had become ruler of Deheubarth. Rhys had heard rumours that Owain Gwynedd was planning to invade Ceredigion in order to reclaim it for Gwynedd. Rhys responded by building a castle at Aberdyfi. However, the threatened invasion did not take place, and Turvey claims that Owain's intention may have been to test the resolve of the new ruler. Rhys \\"raised a ditch to give battle\\", according to Brut y Tywysogion, known as the 'Chronicles of the Princes' in English.Turvey, R. 1997, The Lord Rhys: Prince of Deheubarth. Gomer. p.39. . Although the threat had not materialised, an earthwork topped by a timber castle was built on the site. A motte was constructed at the end of a low ridge running across marshy ground, surrounded on two sides by the confluence of the Dyfi and Einion rivers. The mound is still around 20 feet high with a diameter at the top of about 30 feet and it was originally surrounded by a deep ditch. Roger de Clare, a Norman lord, attacked and captured the castle in about 1158. However, the Lord Rhys recaptured the castle the same year. Llywelyn the Great held an assembly at Aberdyfi Castle in 1216 where he supervised the parcelling-out of land in south Wales to the minor rulers of Deheubarth in return for their homage. Hitherto Llywelyn had ruled over Gwynedd only; however, the Aberdyfi assembly is seen as a crucial point in his reign, marking the moment at which the minor rulers of Wales submitted to Llywelyn's overlordship. In 1230 he began using the style 'prince of Aberffraw, lord of Snowdon' - in essence, a confirmation of his de facto position as prince of Wales.

Ninh stated that his own school in Hanoi was relocated as a result of the bombing, which inspired him to anger rather than fear. Ninh stated that Americans entering Vietnam were viewed as no different from earlier French colonizers, and that he inherited this view himself from his parents. During the war Ninh served in the Glorious 27th Youth Brigade, joining when he was 17 years old. He stated that the Vietnamese people who fought against the Americans were not specifically fighting for Marxism, but rather fighting to bring peace for their country. Hunger was a frequent problem for Ninh and his fellow soldiers, who often moved back and forth from their homes to the battlefields. Of the five hundred who went to war with the brigade in 1969, Ninh is one of ten who survived. Ninh described the fear caused among Vietnamese soldiers by American airpower while in combat during the war: Ninh later called the war \\"fratricide\\" fueled by American firepower. \\"In war, no one wins or loses. There is only destruction.\\" Author In 1987, B·∫£o Ninh published Tr·∫°i b·∫£y ch√∫ l√πn (Camp of Seven Dwarves), a collection of short stories. He has also written a second novel, Steppe, but is said to be reluctant to publish it. In 2018, in an interview with The Caravan magazine, Ninh said that \\"it's not a good time to publish a novel in Vietnam,\\" when asked about his reluctance to publish further. The article shed light on his troubles dealing with his wartime past and censorship in Vietnam, more than forty years after the fall of Saigon.

Joseph was the son of Aaron II, a Khazar ruler who defeated a Byzantine-inspired war against Khazaria on numerous fronts. Joseph's wife (or probably, one of many wives) was the daughter of the king of the Alans. Whether Joseph was the Khagan or the Bek of the Khazars is contested among historians. He describes leading Khazar armies which seems to imply the role of the Bek. However, as he does not refer to a co-ruler in his writings, it is possible that by his time the two-king system had been abandoned altogether. (see Khazar Kingship). Joseph actively sought contact with Jews elsewhere in the diaspora. He corresponded with Hasdai ibn Shaprut, a rabbi in Cordoba, and invited him to settle in Khazaria. He is also mentioned in the Schechter Letter. Joseph was involved in wars against the Kievan Rus and the Pechenegs, as well as sporadic fighting with the Byzantines in the Crimea. He reported that he was allied with the Muslim states around the Caspian Sea against Varangian marauders from Rus' and Scandinavia. Joseph's ultimate fate is unknown. As the destruction of the Khazar empire by Sviatoslav I of Kiev occurred soon after his correspondence with Hasdai (in 967 or 969), it is possible that Joseph was ruler during the Khaganate's collapse.

It grows at altitudes of 2200‚Äì3000 m in Taiwan, and it also extends a short distance into northern Burma. In Chinese it is known as \\"Mount Hua pine\\" (). It grows at 1,000‚Äì3,300 m altitude, with the lower altitudes mainly in the northern part of the range. It is a tree reaching height, with a trunk up to in diameter. Description Juvenile cone right It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. They are long. The cones are long and broad, with stout, thick scales. The seeds are large, long and have only a vestigial wing; they are dispersed by spotted nutcrackers. The cones mature in their second year, this is a juvenile female cone: ; Varieties The species has two or three varieties: * Pinus armandii var. armandii. All the range except for the populations below. * Pinus armandii var. mastersiana. Mountains of central Taiwan. * Pinus armandii var. dabeshanensis. The Dabie Mountains on the Anhui-Hubei border. Alternatively, this variety may be treated as a separate species, Pinus dabeshanensis (Dabie Mountains pine). To add further confusion, Flora of China lists this as P. fenzeliana var. dabeshanensis. IUCN has listed var. dabeshanensis (assessed as Pinus dabeshanensis) as vulnerable and var. mastersiana as endangered. Pinus armandii has also been reported in the past from Hainan off the south coast of China, and two islands off southern Japan, but these pines differ in a number of features and are now treated as distinct species, Hainan white pine (Pinus fenzeliana) and Yakushima white pine (Pinus amamiana) respectively. Uses Pinus armandii seeds are harvested and sold as pine nuts. Research indicates that these nuts can cause pine mouth syndrome. The wood is used for general building purposes; the species is important in forestry plantations in some parts of China. It is also grown as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens in Europe and North America. The scientific name commemorates the French missionary and naturalist Armand David, who first introduced it to Europe. Chinese culture The tree, because of its evergreen foliage, is considered by the Chinese as an emblem of longevity and immortality. Its resin is considered an animated soul-substance, the counterpart of blood in men and animals. In ancient China, Taoist seekers of immortality consumed much of the tree's resin, hoping thereby to prolong life. Legend says that Qiu Sheng () who lived at the time of King Chengtang of Shang () (reigned 1675‚Äì1646 BCE), founder of the Shang Dynasty, was indebted for his longevity to pine-resin. pp 297,300 The Shouxing, Chinese god of longevity (), is usually represented standing at the foot of a pine, while a fairy-crane perches on a branch of the tree. In traditional pictures of \\"happiness, honor and longevity\\" (), the pine-tree represents longevity, in the same manner as the bat symbolizes good fortune due to its homonymic association with the Chinese character for good luck (). A fungus, that the Chinese call Fu Ling grows on the root of the pine-tree, and is believed by the Chinese to suppress all sensations of hunger, cure various diseases, and lengthen life.

In addition to vocals, he performs with an acoustic guitar, 12-string acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bouzouki, harmonica and percussion instruments. Early life and education Meloy was born in Helena, Montana. He attended the University of Oregon in Eugene for two years, studying English and theatre. He then returned to Montana and studied creative writing at the University of Montana in Missoula, graduating in 1998.Schweber, Nate, \\"The Making of Meloy\\" , The Montanan, Winter, 2009. Retrieved 2011-04-08. Musical career While in high school, Meloy was in the band Happy Cactus, and when in college, in Missoula, he was the lead singer and songwriter for Tarkio. Both were indie/folk/alternative country bands. Soon after graduation, he left Tarkio and moved to Portland with the hope of establishing himself among the city's music scene. There, Meloy worked in a pizza parlor to pay rent while starting his musicianship anew by performing at various open mics, sometimes with no one listening except for the bartender. He later reflected in an interview with The Montanan that this experience helped to develop his musical style in the long run: \\"'When I was in that position, with nobody to appeal to or scare away, I thought, 'I might as well do whatever I want to do'...And that created a new thing.'\\" The Decemberists formed in 2000 after Meloy met Nate Query, who introduced him to keyboardist Jenny Conlee, and the three scored a silent film together. Meloy had met multi-instrumentalist Chris Funk, who was a fan of Tarkio, at a solo show prior to meeting Conlee and Query. Since its formation, Meloy has served as the band's singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter. His work with The Decemberists thus far entails seven studio albums, eight EPs, thirteen singles, two compilations, and a live album. In 2003 Meloy contributed vocals to the track \\"The Lady From Reims\\" on Reclinerland's The Ideal Home Music Library. Meloy also contributed vocals on the tracks \\"Cemetery Row\\" and \\"Twilight Distillery\\" on The Minus 5's 2006 Yep Roc release. Meloy covered the Elliott Smith song \\"Clementine\\" for a compilation of Portland, Oregon artists to support a children's charity, and in mid-2006, he contributed the track \\"Lazy Little Ada\\" on the Kill Rock Stars compilation, The Sound the Hare Heard. In 2007, Meloy lent his voice to an episode of Lil' Bush. He appeared with Charlie Salas-Humara in the music video for \\"A Pillar of Salt\\" by The Thermals. In 2005, Meloy went on his first solo tour to support the self-released six-song EP, Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey, consisting of six Morrissey covers. Only 1000 copies of the album were made and they were sold only on this tour. Meloy did a second solo tour in January 2006, playing with Laura Veirs and Amy Annelle. On this tour, he sold an EP featuring covers of British folk artist Shirley Collins. 2006 tour performances were recorded for a live release. Meloy contributed an online bonus track for Lavender Diamond on their Imagine Our Love album, performing a solo version of \\"Oh No.\\" Meloy began another solo tour in April 2008. This coincided with the release of his debut solo album, Colin Meloy Sings Live!, on the Kill Rock Stars label. Singer-songwriter Laura Gibson was the supporting act for the full tour. As with previous EPs, Meloy sold an EP only available on this run: Colin Meloy Sings Sam Cooke, a collection of five Sam Cooke songs, arranged and performed by Meloy, with Gibson singing harmonies. Meloy appeared in the 2013 documentary film Another Day, Another Time: Celebrating the Music of \\"Inside Llewyn Davis\\", which detailed a one-off concert in New York City honoring traditional American folk music in preparation for the release of the Coen brothers' film Inside Llewyn Davis. The concert, organized by T Bone Burnett, featured several notable musicians representing multiple generations; Meloy performed a cover of Jackson C. Frank's \\"Blues Run the Game\\" as well as a version of \\"Joe Hill\\" alongside Joan Baez and Gillian Welch. Television In the 2014 two-part episode of Parks and Recreation entitled \\"Moving Up: Part 1\\" and \\"Moving Up: Part 2\\", Meloy made a cameo appearance as himself with the rest of The Decemberists at The Unity Concert along with other notable artists such as Jeff Tweedy, Ginuwine, and Yo La Tengo. Personal life On February 24, 2006, Carson Ellis, Meloy's wife, gave birth to a son, Henry \\"Hank\\" Meloy. Ellis shares her birthday with Meloy, and produces much of the Decemberists' album and promotional artwork. In 2010, Meloy revealed that Hank has high functioning autism. On March 14, 2013, Ellis gave birth to another child, Milo Cannonball Meloy. Meloy's sister is Maile Meloy, a fiction writer often published in The New Yorker and The New York Times, and his aunt is the late Ellen Meloy, who was also a writer.

They received their name because they have no visible stars, but may be detectable if they contain significant amounts of gas. Astronomers have long theorized the existence of dark galaxies, but there are no confirmed examples to date. Dark galaxies are distinct from intergalactic gas clouds caused by galactic tidal interactions, since these gas clouds do not contain dark matter, so they do not technically qualify as galaxies. Distinguishing between intergalactic gas clouds and galaxies is difficult; most candidate dark galaxies turn out to be tidal gas clouds. The best candidate dark galaxies to date include HI1225+01, AGC229385, and numerous gas clouds detected in studies of quasars. On 25 August 2016, astronomers reported that Dragonfly 44, an ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) with the mass of the Milky Way galaxy, but with nearly no discernable stars or galactic structure, is made almost entirely of dark matter. Observational evidence Large surveys with sensitive, but low resolution radio telescopes like Arecibo or the Parkes Telescope look for 21 cm emission from atomic hydrogen in galaxies. These surveys are then matched to optical surveys to identify any objects with no optical counterpart, i.e. sources with no stars. Another way astronomers search for dark galaxies is to look for hydrogen absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars. This technique has revealed many intergalactic clouds of hydrogen, but following up candidate dark galaxies is difficult, since these sources tend to be too far away, and are often optically drowned out by the bright light from the quasar. Nature of dark galaxy =Origin= In 2005, astronomers found gas cloud VIRGOHI21 and attempted to determine what it was and why it caused such a gravitational pull on galaxy NGC 4254. After years of running out of other explanations, some have concluded that VIRGOHI21 is a dark galaxy, due to the massive effect it had on NGC 4254. =Size= The actual size of dark galaxies is unknown because they cannot be observed with normal telescopes. There have been various estimations, ranging from double the size of the Milky Way to the size of a small quasar. =Structure= Dark galaxies are composed of dark matter. Furthermore, dark galaxies are theoretically composed of hydrogen and dust. Some scientists support the idea that dark galaxies may contain stars. Yet the exact composition of dark galaxies is unknown because there is no conclusive way to spot them so far. However, astronomers estimate that the mass of the gas in these galaxies is approximately 1 billion times that of the Sun. =Methodology to observe dark bodies= Dark galaxies contain no visible stars, and are not visible using optical telescopes. The Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) is a current study using the Arecibo radio telescope to search for dark galaxies, which are predicted to contain detectable amounts of neutral hydrogen. The Arecibo radio telescope is useful where others are not because of its ability to detect the emission from this neutral hydrogen, specifically the 21 cm line. =Alternative theories= Scientists do not have much explanation for some astronomic events, so some use the idea of a dark galaxy to explain these events. Little is known about dark galaxies, and some scientists believe a dark galaxy is actually a newly forming galaxy. One such candidate is in the Virgo cluster. This candidate contains very few stars. Scientists classify this galaxy as a newly forming galaxy, rather than a dark galaxy. Scientists say that the galaxies we see today only began to create stars after dark galaxies. Based on numerous scientific assertions, dark galaxies played a big role in many of the galaxies astronomers and scientists see today. Martin Haehnel, from Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge, claims that the precursor to the Milky Way galaxy was actually a much smaller bright galaxy that had merged with dark galaxies nearby to form the Milky Way we currently see. Multiple scientists agree that dark galaxies are building blocks of modern galaxies. Sebastian Cantalupo of the University of California, Santa Cruz, agrees with this theory. He goes on to say, \\"In our current theory of galaxy formation, we believe that big galaxies form from the merger of smaller galaxies. Dark galaxies bring to big galaxies a lot of gas, which then accelerates star formation in the bigger galaxies.\\" Scientists have specific techniques they use to locate these dark galaxies. These techniques have the capability of teaching us more about other special events that occur in the universe; for instance, the ‚Äúcosmic web‚Äù. This ‚Äúweb‚Äù is made of invisible filaments of gas and dark matter believed to permeate the universe, as well as ‚Äúfeeding and building galaxies and galaxy clusters where the filaments intersect.‚Äù Potential dark galaxies =HE0450-2958= HE0450-2958 is a quasar at redshift z=0.285. Hubble Space Telescope images showed that the quasar is located at the edge of a large cloud of gas, but no host galaxy was detected for the quasar. The authors of the Hubble study suggested that one possible scenario was that the quasar is located in a dark galaxy. However, subsequent analysis by other groups found no evidence that the host galaxy is anomalously dark, and demonstrated that a normal host galaxy is probably present, so the observations do not support the dark galaxy interpretation. =HVC 127-41-330= HVC 127-41-330 is a cloud rotating at high speed between Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy. Astronomer Josh Simon considers this cloud to be a dark galaxy because of the speed of its rotation and its predicted mass. =Smith's Cloud= Smith's Cloud is a candidate to be a dark galaxy, due to its projected mass and survival of encounters with the Milky Way. =VIRGOHI21= Initially discovered in 2000, VIRGOHI21 was announced in February 2005 as a good candidate to be a true dark galaxy. It was detected in 21-cm surveys, and was suspected to be a possible cosmic partner to the galaxy NGC 4254. This unusual-looking galaxy appears to be one partner in a cosmic collision, and appeared to show dynamics consistent with a dark galaxy (and apparently inconsistent with the predictions of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory). However, further observations revealed that VIRGOHI21 was an intergalactic gas cloud, stripped from NGC4254 by a high speed collision. The high speed interaction was caused by infall into the Virgo cluster.

The program premiered in 1973 and as of January 2006 is hosted by Kix Brooks. History American Country Countdown was conceived as a spinoff program from American Top 40, which had premiered in 1970 and showcased the week's most popular singles. The new program was a creation of Casey Kasem and Don Bustany, the same duo behind American Top 40, with Tom Rounds as co-creator and Watermark Inc. distributing. The idea of a nationally syndicated program counting down the top country hits of the week dated several years before the show's premiere. \\"In 1969, when Casey Kasem and I were planning 'American Top 40,' we said, 'Hey, if this works, we can do a country countdown, an MOR countdown, a whatever countdown,'\\" Rounds explained to Radio & Records magazine as to the show's conception. However, it wasn't until 1973 that the AT40 team thought there was sufficient support for a nationally syndicated program.Helton, Lon, \\"A Tale Of Two Countdowns,\\" Radio & Records, September 30, 1983, pg. 66-68. Accessed 12-17-2019. American Country Countdown launched nationwide on October 6, 1973. Like with its parent series, Billboard provided the chart information: in this case, the Hot Country Singles chart was used. The show now uses the Billboard Country Airplay chart, which it has used since September 2017 after eight years of using charts compiled by Mediabase. Singer Don Bowman was the first host of the (originally) three-hour countdown with Bustany producing. Hugh Cherry was the head writer and Bowman was also a writer; there was editing help from Bustany, the main writer and producer of AT40.Helton, Lon, \\"A Tale Of Two Countdowns,\\" Radio & Records, September 30, 1983, pg. 66-68. Accessed 12-17-2019. In June 1974, Bustany stepped aside from his duties in order to focus on AT40 and tapped Bob Kingsley, who had been program director at country station KLAC-Los Angeles, to be ACCs producer.Hall, Claude, \\"Vox Jox,\\" Billboard, June 15, 1974. Via Google Books, accessed 04-24-2015. It was under Kingsley's watch that the program began to increase in popularity, as more and more stations picked up the countdown. On May 6, 1978, Kingsley took on the added responsibility of hosting ACC. Don Bowman had not made any mention that he would be departing the program on the previous show; Kingsley informed the audience that Bowman had left the program to pursue other aspects of his career.American Country Countdown radio broadcast, May 6, 1978. The show grew slowly, with fewer than 100 stations the first year, before passing the 300-affiliate mark in 1980, a year in which the number of stations doubled.Helton, Lon, \\"A Tale Of Two Countdowns,\\" Radio & Records, September 30, 1983, pg. 66-68. Accessed 12-17-2019. Beginning with the broadcast on January 11, 1986, ACC was expanded to four hours, adding several new features, including an \\"ACC Archives\\" feature (similar to one featured on American Top 40 several years earlier, with a chronological playback of No. 1 hits of the 1970s, and later on, the 1980s) and an \\"ACC Calendar\\", spotlighting an artist, song, important innovation, or event in country music.Ginsburg, Janice, \\"Syndicators as innovators,\\" Billboard, March 8, 1986, page C-3. Accessed 04-26-2015. Kingsley hosted the program until December 2005, with his last show being a regular countdown airing Christmas weekend. Like Bowman before him, he never told the audience he would be leaving; in this instance, Kingsley was leaving to host the new Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40. Awards ceremony The Fox Network's awards ceremony, American Country Awards, which started in 2010, was cancelled and replaced by the American Country Countdown Awards in 2014. The ratings for ACCA dropped dramatically compared to the 2013 American Country Awards. According to TV By The Numbers,http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com 18-49 ratings/share dropped from 1.4/4 to 0.9/3 and viewership dropped from 5.14 million to 3.39 million. ACC specials ACC broadcasts several special programs throughout the year. The most notable include: * Christmas in America was a six-hour program aired within the week of Christmas Day, with interview clips from country singers sharing Christmas memories interspersed between songs. The first special aired in 1989. While the title and format continued with Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40 production, ACCs version continued as American Country Christmas, with Brooks being joined by Ronnie Dunn (from 2006 to 2008); the 2009 special consisted of Brooks interviewing country music artists. In 2010, clips of Brooks's interviews with students at elementary schools from across the country were included in addition to the artist interviews. * The Year End Countdown. From 1973 to 1998, the year-end special reviewed the top 100 country hits of the year. The total was halved to 50 in 1979 and from 1999 to 2004, trimmed to 40 from 2005 to 2010, and cut to 30 starting in 2011 (with songs that \\"just missed\\" the top 30 played as extras). From 1978 through 2004, the most notable highlight was a montage of all the No. 1 songs included in the countdown's survey period (usually the previous November to the current November, although it has included early December for a time in the late 1980s) before Kingsley played the year's top song. Other special programs, usually centering on a theme or to promote a much-anticipated album that was about to go on sale, air throughout the year. Past specials have paid homage to the West, presented unusual or notable chart facts and performer accomplishments, counted down the top acts of all time, profiled a performer, and presented the top female and male singers of the past decade. Substitute hosts During the early years, Kingsley (after he became the show's producer) was the fill-in host when Bowman was absent. During the Kingsley era, a top radio personality from one of ACCs affiliates filled in as host in Kingsley's absence. Kix Brooks did not assume hosting duties until January 21, 2006. Since 2006, either a top country music act or ACC writer Suzanne Alexander (previous Donna Britt) has served as substitute host whenever Brooks is absent. Reairing of older shows In April 2015, Nash FM, the media brand and network of country music stations owned by Cumulus Media, announced it would begin re-airing classic ACC programs from the Kingsley era, starting the weekend of May 2. The show, featuring programs originally aired between 1990 and 2005, was three hours in length (for four-hour programs, the first hour wasn't included).\\"NASH Icon Partners With Bob Kingsley For ACC-Rewind,\\" Media Confidential, April 17, 2015.

The first aired ACC Rewind program featured an ACC show which originally aired May 1, 1993. The final program, a re-airing of the 1999 year-end countdown, aired the weekend of December 28, 2019. Awards ACC was named Billboard magazine's \\"Network/Syndicated Program of the Year: Country\\" from 1987 to 2002. Kingsley twice won the Country Music Association's National Broadcast Personality of the Year award (in 2001 and 2003).

Opel's top-ranging models were traditionally the Admiral and Kapit√§n, introduced in 1938 and 1937 respectively. In 1964, these models were joined, in the so-called \\"KAD\\" (Kapit√§n, Admiral, Diplomat) range, by the new Opel Diplomat. In most respects the three were badge-engineered versions of the same vehicle.  Diplomat A (1964‚Äì1968)  In February 1964, Opel introduced a new range of flagship models as successors to the Opel Kapit√§n P-LV of 1959/1963. These KAD models (Opel Kapit√§n, Admiral and Diplomat; also referred to as \\"The Big Three\\" by Opel) were available with 2.6-litre and 2.8-litre in- line six-cylinder petrol engines (100 or 125 PS/99 or 123 hp), or a V8-Chevrolet small-block engine 283 (4.6-litre) teamed with a two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission (190 PS/187 hp). The latter engine was supplanted in the saloon by the V8-Chevrolet small-block Type 327 (5.4-litre) in October 1966 (230 PS/227 hp). As the company's range-topping model, the Diplomat was available only with the V-8. A Diplomat Coup√©, with the 327 engine only, was also available from 1965 to 1967 in limited numbers. The coup√© was built by coachbuilder Karmann and cost DM 25,500 (as much as seven Volkswagen Beetles). 347 Coup√©s were built. In September 1967, the Diplomat, and its less expensive siblings, received a work-over consisting of rub strips on its flanks, new recirculating ball steering by ZF, and a heated rear window. At the same time, a HL (Hochleistung or high performance) version of the 2.8-liter six became available (140 PS/138 hp) for the Kapit√§n and Admiral models. These cars were even larger than their predecessors, stretching to almost 200 inches, and found little favour with the European public. Between February 1964 and November 1968, Opel built 89,277 KAD models (24,249 Kapit√§ne, 55,876 Admir√§le and 9,152 Diplomaten), whereas its direct predecessor, the Kapit√§n P-LV, had registered 145,618 sales over a comparable four-year span. File:Diplo A Coupe Front.jpgOpel Diplomat Coupe File:Opel Diplomat A (02).jpgRear view File:Diplo A Coupe Heck.jpgOpel Diplomat V8 Coup√©  Diplomat B (1969‚Äì1977)  In March 1969, Opel introduced a new line of KAD models with new bodies and a more sophisticated chassis with a De Dion tube rear axle. These cars were slightly smaller than their predecessors. While the lesser models (Opel Kapit√§n and Admiral) were also available with a carburetted 2.8 l-inline six, the Diplomat could be had with either a fuel- injected version of this engine (Diplomat E) or with Chevrolet¬¥s 327-V8 (Diplomat V8), now coupled to a 3-speed Turbo-Hydramatic. The new body was a typical General Motors style and bore a strong resemblance to the contemporary Holden Brougham from GM Australia. Rear view of Opel Diplomat E automatic The Diplomat V-8 was hoped to compete with Mercedes' new 350 and 450 SE; from May 1973 Opel even offered a long-wheelbase version of the V-8 to keep up with Mercedes' SEL models. In October 1971 the Diplomat's list of standard features included H1 halogen headlamps, radio antenna integrated into the windscreen and remote-controlled rear view mirror. From January 1972 the 4-speed manual gear box was no longer offered on the Diplomat E. September 1972 saw the introduction of a modified grille with OPEL script relocated from its left side to its central portion. A number of the 'lesser' Admiral cars had their car boot lid fitted with Diplomat lettering/badges. This led to some confusion by today's car buyers, even in the TV series Der letzte Bulle (German), but the cars are easily identified by their vertical headlights for the Diplomat versus horizontal ones for the Admiral. Opel continued the production until 1977 but found little success in the market: only 61,559 KAD cars were built from March 1969 to late 1977 (of which 4,976 Kapit√§ne, about 33,000 Admir√§le and about 23,500 Diplomaten). They were superseded in 1978 by the new Opel Senator of a somewhat reduced size and more modern, European styling. In the early 1970s, GM considered the use of Opel Diplomat as the basis of forthcoming first generation Cadillac Seville. However, the precise panel gap tolerance found in Diplomat was beyond what the GM North American manufacturing plants could do without the extensive and expensive change to the sheetmetal stamping and welding process. The Diplomat V8 furnished the technical base for the Bitter CD, a limited-production GT. The production of the handbuilt German car, was using the foolproof chassis, drivetrain, mechanicals and even the dashboard of an Opel Diplomat. The whole Ferrari looks with Opel inerts enterprise for Bitter, came to an end in the early eighties, when the Opel Diplomat chassis was no longer available to buy from Opel.

The first was the , a quasi-independent branch of the Imperial Japanese Army which was dissolved shortly after World War II. The second is the , a civilian law enforcement organization formed as part of the National Police Agency. Imperial Guard of the Imperial Japanese Army Original headquarters of the Japanese Imperial Guard, now part of the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. An Ukiyo-e print of the Japanese Imperial Guard ((ËøëË°õÂ∏´Âõ£ Konoe Shidan) driving back Russian infantry at the Battle of Shaho during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 The Imperial Guard of the Imperial Japanese Army was formed in 1867. It became the foundation of the Imperial Japanese Army after the Emperor Meiji assumed all the powers of state during the Meiji Restoration. The Imperial Guard, which consisted of 12,000 men organized and trained along French Military lines, first saw action in the Satsuma Rebellion. It was organized into the 1st Guards Infantry Brigade which had the 1st and 2nd Regiments. The 3rd and 4th Regiments belonged to the 2nd Guards infantry Brigade. By 1885 the Imperial Japanese Army consisted of seven divisions, one of which was the Imperial Guard. A division consisted of four regiments containing two battalions each. The Imperial Guard division was based in Tokyo and recruited nationally. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, a second Guard Brigade was formed from indigenous Formosans. In 1920 the Guards Cavalry Regiment, Guards Field Artillery Regiment, Guards Engineer Battalion, Guards Transport Battalion, plus other Guards service units were added. From 1937 to 1939 the Guards Engineer Battalion was expanded into a regiment as was the Guards Transport Battalion. =Pacific War= In September 1939, the division was split into the 1st and 2nd Guards Brigades. The 1st Guards Brigade, which contained the 1st and 2nd Guards Infantry Regiments, the cavalry regiment, and half of the support units, was transferred to South China. Here it became known as the Mixed Guards Brigade. In October 1940, it joined other Japanese units occupying French Indo-China. In April 1941 the Mixed Guards Brigade returned to Tokyo but it did not rejoin the Imperial Guards Division. The 2nd Guards Brigade, which contained 3rd and 4th Guards Regiments, also went to China. In 1940, it went to Shanghai before being posted to Hainan Island. In June 1941, the 5th Guards Infantry Regiment joined the 2nd Guards Brigade becoming the Imperial Guard Division again. It later saw action in the Battles of Malaya and Singapore with Tomoyuki Yamashita's 25th Army. In May 1943, all designated Imperial Guard units were renamed again. The Mixed Guards Brigade in Tokyo became the 1st Guards Division (which now consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 6th Guard Regiments) and the Imperial Guard Division became the 2nd Guards Division. The 3rd Guards Division, which never left Japan, was formed in 1944. It consisted of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Regiments. Sources do not agree if there ever was a 7th Guard Regiment. All military Imperial Guard Divisions were dissolved at the end of World War II. =War crimes= In Malaya and Singapore, the Guard Division was involved in several notorious Japanese war crimes such as the Parit Sulong Massacre and the Sook Ching massacre. Lt Gen. Takuma Nishimura, who was sentenced to life imprisonment by a British military court in relation to the Sook Ching killings, was later convicted of war crimes by an Australian Military Court in relation to the Parit Sulong massacre. He was executed by hanging on June 11, 1951.7th Battalion The Cameronians Multiple Sclerosis Research Initiative =Uniform= Mounted Imperial Guards wearing the dark blue dress uniform during Emperor Hirohito's wedding in 1924 Until 1939, the Cavalry of the Imperial Guard wore a French style parade uniform consisting of a dark-blue tunic with red Brandenburg braiding, a red kepi and red breeches. The red kepi had a white plume with a red base. Prior to the general adoption of khaki by the Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), an all white linen uniform had been worn in hot weather. The Infantry of the Imperial Guard wore a dark blue uniform with white leggings for both parade and service wear until 1905. It was distinguished from that of the line infantry by a red band and piping on the peaked service cap (instead of yellow). Officers wore a dark blue tunic with 5 rows of black mohair froggings and dark blue breeches with a red stripe down each seam. Following the adoption of a khaki service dress, the Guard Infantry wore this on all occasions, although officers retained the blue and red uniform for certain ceremonial occasions when not parading with troops. In the field, the army's standard khaki uniform was worn by all Imperial Guard units from 1905 to 1945. Guard units were distinguished by a wreathed star in bronze worn on the headgear, in contrast to the plain five pointed star worn by other units. Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency Imperial Guard Headquarters After the disbandment of the Imperial guard divisions, their missions were merged into the , a civilian law enforcement branch of the Ministry of the Imperial Household. In 1947, it was reorganized into the of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and then transferred to the . After several renaming, it became the in 1949. With the total reconstruction of the Japanese police systems in 1954, it became a part of the National Police Agency. At present, it consists of over 900 security police personnel who provide personal security for the Emperor, Crown Prince and other members of the Imperial Family, as well as protection of imperial properties, including the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Kyoto Imperial Palace, Katsura Imperial Villa, Shugakuin Imperial Villa (both in Kyoto), Shosoin Imperial Repository in Nara and the imperial villas as Hayama, Kanagawa and Nasu, Tochigi.https://www.npa.go.jp/kougu/outline/index.html?goto=section02 The Imperial Guard also maintains a 14 horse mounted police unit for use by guards of honour at state ceremonies. In addition to their security duties, the Imperial Guard is also responsible for fire-fighting within the grounds of the Palace, and maintains fire engines and trained staff of this purpose. The NPA Imperial Guards wear a dark blue or a blue-grey police uniform with white gloves while on duty with peaked caps for public duties activities. They also wear white pistol belts, lanyards, helmets, boot laces or leggings. They carry police rank insignia in their shoulder boards. = Gallery = File:Japanese Imperial Guard Music Band in 1950s.jpgAn Imperial Guard Music Band marching through Tokyo in the 1950s.

Byford was born in England, but spent most of his life in Belgrade. He became a naturalized citizen of Serbia in 2004. He directed children's television programmes, first in the UK for the BBC, and later in Yugoslavia, for TV Belgrade and TV Sarajevo. His children's TV series enjoyed great success in former Yugoslavia, and continue to be popular. Biography Born in Salisbury, Byford started his TV career directing films for the BBC Blue Peter programme. His first TV documentary \\"I Want to Be a Showjumper\\" won a BAFTA Harlequin \\"Rediffusion Star Award\\" (for Children's Programmes) in 1970. In 1971 he moved to Yugoslavia, where he married and continued to write and direct children's television programmes during the 1970s and 1980s. He is best known for his children's TV series: Neven ('Marigold'), Babino unuƒçe ('Granny's Boy') and Poletarac ('Fledgling'), all for TV Belgrade, as well as Nedeljni zabavnik ('Sunday Magazine'), 'Musical Notebook' and Tragom ptice Dodo ('On the Trail of the Dodo'), all for TV Sarajevo. 'Fledgling' won a Grand Prix at the Prix Jeunesse International Festival in Munich in 1980. He spent his last fifteen years teaching English, writing and translating. In 2006, after 40 years of working with children, he joined the Children's Cultural Centre Belgrade, where he wrote and directed programmes, taught English and translated. He has written and published a self-portrait trilogy, \\"Pigs Do Not Eat Banana Skins\\", completed a collection of seven short stories under the title \\"The Golden Candlestick\\", and completed his official autobiography, \\"Warts and All\\". His name is also associated with a park in the southern suburbs of Belgrade, Banjica Forest, as during the late 1980s he campaigned for it to have special protection because of the large number of nightingales and other species of birds that nest in it. The wood is now an officially protected natural habitat and has its name changed officially to Byford's Forest in 2015. On 1 April 2010, Byford celebrated the 50th year of his artistic career with the opening of his photograph exhibition, Joy in 100 Pictures, consisting of photographs he took at the 'Joy of Europe' festivals in 2008 and 2009. The same year, he appeared on screen as a cricket umpire in a television advert for Mivela water during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The ad featured players from the Serbia national cricket team and Serbian footballer Radosav Petroviƒá. Pension issue Byford moved to Belgrade, Serbia, former Yugoslavia in 1971 and as a foreigner he was not allowed to participate in the state's pension fund system. Since his wife was from former Yugoslavia (now Serbia), he should inherit the citizenship right after a certain number of years spent in marriage. He received Serbian citizenship only at the age of 65 after intervention of Serbia's then president Boris Tadiƒá. It was too late to become a pension fund participant, since he would be at the age of 80 before he gains the right for a minimal pension. On 1 January 2011, Serbian newspaper agency Blic wrote an article about Mr. Byford being rejected for a national recognition award for his contribution and previous work (which effectively provides the right to a national pension), despite being nominated by several of his colleagues as described in an interview. Rejecting Mr. Byford's requests for the pension caused significant discontent among people who remember his work from their childhood. Two weeks later after the original article was published, Mr. Byford applied for and received a regular pension, giving him the right to apply for a National Pension. In a later article Byford thanked many supporters who offered their help and started a petition on a Facebook social network. As a result, Mr. Byford received several job offers, but many of them he had to turn down due to his specific health issues. Mr. Byford eventually returned to RTS as a consultant in the Children's Programmes Department. In January 2012 he received national recognition and was awarded a National Pension. Health issue In 2005 Byford was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of cancer formed by malignant plasma cells. He died of the illness on 5 May 2014 in Belgrade. He raised media attention in 2013 when, during an interview for Blic, he complained that he could not obtain Durogesic, a medication needed in his treatment because pharmacies in Belgrade did not have it in stock. He accused excessive bureaucratic procedures for the shortage of drug, saying that he is going to die \\"not of cancer, but of bureaucracy\\". He received a lot of support from his admirers who sent him enough medicine. A month later, he announced that he was unable to obtain yet another medication necessary for his treatment, Endoxan, without which, he claimed, he could not survive for more than few days. Byford blamed his situation on new legislation which excessively complicates procedures for drug procurement.

The role of \\"Frankie\\" was played by Donna Douglas from The Beverly Hillbillies TV series. The film reached #40 on the Variety weekly national box office list for 1966. The budget of the film was estimated at $4.5 million. The director was Frederick De Cordova, who in 1970 went on to become the director and producer of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Plot Johnny and girlfriend Frankie are performers on a Mississippi River riverboat, which also has a casino. Johnny is a compulsive gambler who is down on his luck and in debt. Johnny and his friend Cully, a musician and composer, visit a gypsy camp to get his fortune told. A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny that he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck. Back on the boat, Johnny and Cully promptly encounter Nellie Bly, their boss Clint Braden's on-again, off-again girlfriend. Nellie has just caught Braden seducing another singer, Mitzi. Since she has red hair, Nellie is persuaded by Johnny to touch his chips for luck. After he wins, Johnny is convinced that the gypsy must be correct. Frankie finds out and becomes jealous, as does Johnny's boss. In a bit of musical theatre, Frankie shoots Johnny for dancing with Nellie Bly while singing Cully's latest song. A Broadway recruiter sees the riverboat show and buys the rights to this new song, suggesting that Frankie and Johnny should work together with him in New York City. Landing in New Orleans, the musical cast and riverboat crew attend a masked ball. Frankie, Nellie and Mitzi all rent the same Madame Pompadour costume. Johnny is eager for the luck of redhead Nellie to win more money, contrary to Frankie's expressed wishes. Being masked and in costume, Frankie and Nellie scheme to switch places to test Johnny's lucky-redhead theory. Johnny wins $10,000 at roulette, but when he kisses the woman he believes to be Nellie, he discovers the switch. Frankie is furious and throws all the winnings out of a window, into the street. Blackie, a dim-witted stooge who works for the boss, hears Braden drunkenly complain about how he has lost Nellie. Thinking he can be of help, Blackie switches the blank cartridge in Frankie's stage gun for a real bullet. The boss tries to prevent the impending disaster, but arrives on stage too late and Johnny is shot for real. Frankie forgives his gambling as the love of her life appears to be dying but he stands up, apparently unhurt. Johnny was saved because the bullet struck a lucky medallion he was wearing that Frankie had given him.

Under his contract with United Artists, Presley was paid $700,000 plus 50% of the profits. Reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times reported that the film opened with a \\"dull thud\\" and \\"sheds feathers almost from the start\\" stating that Presley's formula never before \\"seemed so feeble and so obvious.\\"The New York Times. July 21, 1966, \\"Neighborhoods Get 'Frankie and Johnny', New Presley Film\\". Accessed February 27, 2016 Variety wrote that the film \\"hits the mark as pleasant entertainment, and is certain to be another Presley money-winner.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times felt that despite \\"generally mediocre production values\\" particularly lacking in good dance numbers, the film was \\"fast-moving fun\\" and a good vehicle for Presley.Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times, May 27, 1966, \\"'Frankie and Johnny' Good Presley Vehicle\\". Part IV, p. 12. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \\"After a long series of lifeless flops, Elvis Presley is here right back on form; or at least the film round him is (Elvis himself rarely changes) ...

A cardinal since 1985, he was Archbishop of Cebu from 1982 to 2010. Early life and education Vidal was born on 6 February 1931 in Mogpog, Marinduque to Faustino S. Vidal of Pila, Laguna, and Natividad Jamin of Mogpog, the fifth of six siblings. In 1937, Vidal received his first communion at the International Eucharistic Celebration. He attended Mogmog Elementary School for his primary education. Vidal studied at the Minor Seminary of the Most Holy Rosary (now Our Lady of Mount Carmel Seminary) in Sariaya, Quezon, and at the Saint Francis de Sales Seminary in Lipa, Batangas, where he studied philosophy. He also studied theology at the San Carlos Seminary in Makati, Metro Manila. Ministry Vidal was ordained a deacon on 24 September 1955 and as a priest on 17 March 1956 on Lucena,Quezon Province, by Bishop Alfredo Obviar. Vidal became the spiritual director of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Seminary in Sariaya, Quezon. He was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Malolos on 30 November 1971 and was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Carmine Rocco, Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines. Less than two years later, he was appointed Archbishop of Lipa by Pope Paul VI. Pope John Paul II appointed Vidal Coadjutor Archbishop of Cebu in 1981 and he became Archbishop there on 24 August 1982, succeeding Cardinal Julio Rosales. Cardinal Vidal was a frequent collaborator with Bishop Teofilo Camomot and bore witness to the native Cebuano prelate's claimed miraculous deed. Vidal also helped found the Catechist Missionaries of St. Theresa, a Catholic religious congregation. Vidal was President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) from 1986 to 1987 and became Chairman of the CBCP-Episcopal Commission on the Clergy in 1989. He was appointed as the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences's Convenor of the Standing Committee (1985 to 1994). He was a delegate to the Synod on Reconciliation (1983), the Extraordinary Synod (1985), the Synod on Priests (1991), and the Synod on Religious Life (1994), and also served as President Delegate at the 1989 Synod on the Laity. He was also a member of the Permanent Council of the Synod from 1989 to 1994. Vidal's posts in the Roman Curia included memberships in the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the Congregation for Catholic Education, and the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers. =College of Cardinals= On 25 May 1985, he became Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Pietro e Paolo a Via Ostiense. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI, the only Filipino Cardinal to do so, because Cardinal Jaime Sin's poor health prevented him from attending. =Leadership in the Philippines= Vidal and the Cardinal Archbishop of Manila Jaime Sin supported the 1986 Philippine People Power Revolution. As Archbishop of Cebu and president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, Vidal led the rest of the Philippine prelates and made a joint declaration against the government and the results of the snap election. In 1989 President Corazon Aquino asked Vidal to convince General Jose Comendador, who was sympathetic to the rebel forces fighting her government, to surrender peacefully. His intervention averted what could have been a bloody coup. In 2001, during the 2001 People Power Revolution Cardinal Vidal convinced President Joseph Estrada to step down. Estrada was later detained. Vidal along with Senator Manny Villar and House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr. wrote a letter appealing to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to grant pardon to Estrada in the \\"spirit of national unity and reconciliation\\". Estrada was pardoned and released from detention on October 26, 2007. Later life and death Pope Benedict XVI accepted Vidal's resignation as Archbishop of Cebu on 15 October 2010. He was succeeded by Archbishop Jose S. Palma of Palo. In retirement, Vidal lived in Sto. Ni√±o Village in Cebu City. He continued presiding at Masses and attending events organized by the Archdiocese of Cebu. He underwent a coronary angiogram procedure and had a pacemaker installed in 2004. He experienced a mild stroke on 23 September 2013. He was confined to the hospital multiple times beginning in 2014 for pneumonia. He was confined in a hospital in May 2017 for the same illness, given the Catholic sacrament of anointing of the sick on 11 October, and died on 18 October. Recognition Vidal received recognition from the government. On 7 December 2010 the Senate of the Philippines recognized his service to Cebu by Senate Resolution NO. 306: \\"It is resolved by the Senate, to honor Ricardo Cardinal Vidal, Archbishop of Cebu, for his service to the people of Cebu, providing spiritual leadership and inspiration, helping the community avert or survive several crises and conflicts, often acting as a peacekeeper and giving the voice of moderation amid clashing views and interests in local and national issues.\\" He also received recognition from the House of Representatives through House Resolution 593. The Province of Cebu gave the highest award that a province could give, the Order of Lapu-lapu. The cities of Cebu and Talisay made him an \\"adopted son\\" of the two localities. In March 2009 the University of the Visayas granted him the title of Doctor of Humanities honoris causa. Calls for Canonization There have been calls for the late Cardinal Vidal to be proclaimed a saint. It has been well known that Vidal was influential in pushing canonization causes of several Filipinos for sainthood, especially Pedro Calungsod. Filipino Catholics have been urging that Vidal receive the same honor. The Cebu City North District Representative, Raul del Mar, during the necrological service at Vidal's wake, called on the Catholic Church officials to work for the canonization of the prelate whom he describes to have lived a life of holiness and noteworthy humility that is worthy of sainthood. Among those who claim that the beloved archbishop lived a holy life was Senator Vicente Sotto III, who said to the news reporters as he showed a rosary given to him by Vidal, ‚ÄúNow, I have a new friend in heaven. He is praying for me.‚Äù References External links *Vatican Cardinal Bio *Biography at catholic-pages.com *Catholic Hierarchy ‚Äì Ricardo Jamin Cardinal Vidal *Cardinal Ricardo Jamin Vidal at cardinalrating.com *Cardinal Ricardo J.

Life He was the son of Sir John Throckmorton, the seventh out of eight sons of Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton Court. He was a nephew of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, one of Elizabeth's diplomats, who had held the post of Chief Justice of Chester but was removed in 1579, a year before his death. His paternal grandmother, Hon. Katherine Vaux, daughter of Nicholas Vaux, 1st Baron Vaux of Harrowden, was the paternal aunt of the Protestant queen consort of King Henry VIII, Catherine Parr. Francis Throckmorton was educated in Oxford and entered the Inner Temple in London as a pupil in 1576. In 1580, he travelled to the European continent and met leading Catholic malcontents from England abroad (in Spain and France). It was in Paris that Throckmorton met Charles Paget and Thomas Morgan, agents of Mary, Queen of Scots. Following his return to England in 1583, he served as an intermediary for communications between supporters of the Catholic cause on the continent, the imprisoned Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Spanish ambassador Bernardino de Mendoza.Stephen Budiansky. Her Majesty's Spymaster: Elizabeth I, Sir Francis Walsingham, and the Birth of Modern Espionage, Penguin, Jul 25, 2006. pg 123-139. His activities raised the suspicions of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth I's spymaster. A search of his house produced incriminating evidence and, after torture on the rack, Throckmorton confessed his involvement in a plot to overthrow the Queen and restore the Catholic Church in England. An invasion led by Henry I, Duke of Guise, would have been coupled with an orchestrated uprising of Catholics within the country. Although Throckmorton later retracted his confession, he was convicted of high treason and executed in 1584.Chisholm, 1911, p.891 In film and literature Sir Francis Throckmorton is featured in the film Elizabeth: The Golden Age, where he is played by Steven Robertson. In the film, he is shown asking for help from his cousin, Elizabeth Throckmorton, one of Queen Elizabeth's ladies- in-waiting and later the wife of Sir Walter Raleigh. Throckmorton's recruitment to act as a courier to Queen Mary and the way he was discovered by Walsingham's agents are depicted in Ken Follet's historical novel \\"A Column of Fire\\". As depicted in the book, Throckmorton was a minor member of the conspiracy, the main organiser who recruited him managing to escape undetected.

See also The Iron Man page on the official George Adamson web site. Described by some as a modern fairy tale, Quote: \\"Reckoned one of the greatest of modern fairy tales.\\" Observer. it describes the unexpected arrival in England of a giant \\"metal man\\" of unknown origin who rains destruction on the countryside by eating industrial farm equipment, before befriending a small boy and defending the world from a dragon from outer space. Expanding the narrative beyond a criticism of warfare and inter- human conflict, Hughes later wrote a sequel, The Iron Woman (1993), describing retribution based on environmental themes related to pollution. The first North American edition was also published in 1968, by Harper & Row with illustrations by Robert Nadler. Its main title was changed to The Iron Giant, and internal mentions of the metal man changed to iron giant, to avoid confusion with the Marvel Comics character Iron Man. American editions have continued the practice, as Iron Man has become a multimedia franchise. Faber and Faber published a new edition in 1985 with illustrations by Andrew Davidson, for which Hughes and Davidson won the Kurt Maschler Award, or the Emils. From 1982 to 1999 that award recognised one British \\"work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other.\\" The 1985 Davidson edition was published in Britain and America (retaining 'giant') and there were re-issues with the Davidson illustrations, including some with other cover artists. Yet the novel has been re-illustrated by at least two others, Dirk Zimmer and Laura Carlin (current, Walker Books). Pete Townshend produced a musical concept album based on the novel in 1989, while Brad Bird directed a critically acclaimed animated film adaptation in 1999.  Story  The Iron Man arrives seemingly from nowhere, and his appearance is described in detail. To survive, he feeds on local farm equipment. When the farm hands discover their destroyed tractors and diggers, a trap is set consisting of a covered pit on which a red lorry is set as bait. Hogarth, a local boy, lures the Iron Man to the trap. The plan succeeds, and the Iron Man is buried alive. The next spring, the Iron Man digs himself free of the pit. To keep him out of the way, the boy Hogarth takes charge and brings the Iron Man to a metal scrap-heap to feast. The Iron Man promises not to cause further trouble for the locals, as long as no one troubles him. Time passes, and the Iron Man is treated as merely another member of the community. However, astronomers monitoring the sky make a frightening new discovery; an enormous space-being, resembling a dragon, moving from orbit to land on Earth. The creature (soon dubbed the \\"Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon\\") crashes heavily on Australia (which it is large enough to cover the whole of) and demands that humanity provide him with food. Terrified, humans send their armies to destroy the dragon, but it remains unharmed. When the Iron Man hears of this global threat, he allows himself to be disassembled and transported to Australia where he challenges the creature to a contest of strength. If the Iron Man can withstand the heat of burning petroleum for longer than the creature can withstand the heat of the Sun, the creature must obey the Iron Man's commands forevermore; if the Iron Man melts or is afraid of melting before the space being undergoes or fears pain in the Sun, the creature has permission to devour the whole Earth. After playing the game two rounds, the dragon is so badly burned that he no longer appears physically frightening. The Iron Man by contrast has only a deformed ear-lobe to show for his pains. The alien creature admits defeat. When asked why he came to Earth, the dragon reveals that he is a peaceful \\"star spirit\\" who experienced excitement about the ongoing sights and sounds produced by the violent warfare of humanity. In his own life, he was a singer of the \\"music of the spheres\\"; the harmony of his kind that keeps the cosmos in balance in stable equilibrium. The Iron Man orders the dragon to sing to the inhabitants of Earth, flying just behind the sunset, to help soothe humanity toward a sense of peace. The beauty of his music distracts the population from its egocentrism and tendency to fight, causing the first worldwide lasting peace. Adaptations The story has appeared several times on the BBC's Jackanory, most recently in 1985 when it was read by Tom Baker. In 1989, guitarist Pete Townshend, from the rock band The Who, released a rock opera adaptation, The Iron Man: A Musical. In 1999, Warner Bros. released an animated film using the novel as a basis, entitled The Iron Giant, directed by Brad Bird and co- produced by Pete Townshend. Though the film underperformed at the box office, it did however receive widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, and has since then garnered a cult following.

Lighthouse located north of Duncannon near Arthurstown, Ballyhack, An Pasaiste, Passage and Passage East, County Wexford Duncannon () is a village in southwest County Wexford, Ireland. Bordered to the west by Waterford harbour and sitting on a rocky headland jutting into the channel is the strategically prominent Duncannon Fort which dominates the village. Primarily a fishing village, Duncannon also relies heavily on tourism and is situated on the clearly signposted and very scenic Ring of Hook drive. Duncannon beach, a mile long golden beach, was once a blue flag recipient. Duncannon Fort, which was built in 1588, incorporates a maritime museum, Cockleshell Arts Gallery, Officer's Mess Caf√© and Craft shop and various other Art and Craft outlets and is open daily to visitors seven days from June to September. During the off season guided tours are available from Monday to Friday. Duncannon Fort was the location for the opening scenes of the 2002 remake of 'The Count of Monte Cristo', starring Jim Caviezel and Richard Harris. After being closed for some time, Duncannon Fort reopened to the public in 2016 when guided tours recommenced. History According to legend, the settlement at Duncannon dates back to the time of Fionn mac Cumhaill (pop: Finn McCool) and the Fianna in the 3rd century AD. Duncannon was of vital strategic importance as its fort commanded the bay giving sea access to Waterford harbour. As a result, it was centrally involved in wars and sieges during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the Irish Confederate Wars (1641‚Äì1652), the fort at Duncannon was initially occupied by English soldiers and used as a base for an attack on nearby Redmond's Hall (now Loftus Hall). During this period it was besieged three times. In 1645, it was taken by an Irish Confederate army under general Thomas Preston. Its English garrison surrendered after lengthy bombardment, during which their second in command Larcan was killed, and a ship, The Great Lewis, trying to bring supplies to the garrison was sunk with the loss of 200 lives (see Siege of Duncannon). During the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Duncannon was besieged again,McKeiver as part of the Siege of Waterford, firstly in November 1649 by Oliver Cromwell and Michael Jones in 1649. The fort's Irish garrison held out, and the siege was abandoned in December of that year. However, in July 1650, Henry Ireton renewed the siege, and the fort and town surrendered after the fall of Waterford, but before their food and supplies had run out. In 1659 and 1660, Duncannon was the only town to remain openly loyal to Edmund Ludlow after forces loyal to General George Monck took control of Dublin and other towns. In the Williamite war in Ireland (1689‚Äì1691) James II, after his defeat at the battle of the Boyne, embarked at Duncannon for Kinsale and then to exile in France. Later his son in law and enemy William of Orange, marched on its cobblestones as the town and fort surrendered to his army without resistance. The fort at Duncannon was one of the few places in county Wexford that did not fall to the rebels during the 1798 rebellion though a force sent out from the fort to defend Wexford town was defeated at the battle of Three Rocks. The fort and town then became a sanctuary for fleeing loyalists and troops in south Wexford and was also used as a prison and place of execution for suspected rebels. Duncannon's strategic importance continued to be recognised throughout the 19th century. Napoleon sought and got intelligence on its strength and weakness, in preparation for a possible invasion of Ireland. Duncannon fort was used by the FCA (Irish army reserve) as a barracks and training facility until recent years. Transport Bus √âireann route 370 links Duncannon to New Ross, Waterford and Wellingtonbridge. There are several buses daily except Sundays. The nearest railway station is Waterford railway station, some 22 km distant via the Ballyhack - Passage East ferry. Sports The local Gaelic Athletic Association club team is called St James' G.A.A club, and plays in the Wexford Senior Football Championship and the Wexford Intermediate Hurling Championship. The club won the Wexford Senior Football Championship in 2015, having been promoted from the Intermediate rank the previous year. The hurling team have won several county titles having begun at Junior D level in 2009.http://stjamesgaa.com/ In recent years Matthew O'Hanlon has captained the Wexford Senior Hurling team to win the Leinster SHC final in 2019 and village native Graeme Molloy has also captained the Wexford senior football side prior to his retirement. The local soccer team is Duncannon United who play in the Wexford League.http://www.wexfordfootballleague.com/index.php/clubs/41-duncannon Events There are three festivals of note held in Duncannon every year. In August there are two festivals. Firstly a Sand Festival is held on the beach. This includes a Sand Sculpting exhibition in a large tent on the beach and many other events including crab fishing competitions and one of the largest fireworks displays in Ireland to launch every festival, off of a boat near Duncannon beach. A Kitesurfing Festival is also held every August, date dependent on tides. Previously an annual Military and Vehicle Re-Enactment was held on the June Bank Holiday week-end. However this has been discontinued.

Future-proofing is the process of anticipating the future and developing methods of minimizing the effects of shocks and stresses of future events.Rich, Brian. ‚ÄúThe Principles of Future-Proofing: A Broader Understanding of Resiliency in the Historic Built Environment.‚Äù Journal of Preservation Education and Research, vol. 7 (2014): 31‚Äì49. Future-proofing is used in industries such as electronics, medical industry, industrial design, and more recently, in design for climate change. The principles of future-proofing are extracted from other industries and codified as a system for approaching an intervention in an historic building. Concept In general, the term \\"future-proof\\" refers to the ability of something to continue to be of value into the distant future‚Äîthat the item does not become obsolete. The concept of future-proofing is the process of anticipating the future and developing methods of minimizing the effects of shocks and stresses of future events. This term is commonly found in electronics, data storage, and communications systems. It is also found in industrial design, computers, software, health care/medical, strategic sustainable development, strategic management consultancy and product design. Study of the principles behind ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù both within the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry and among outside industries can give vital information about the basis of future- proofing. This information can be distilled into several Principles which can be applied to a variety of areas. Electronics and communications In future-proof electrical systems buildings should have ‚Äúflexible distribution systems to allow communication technologies to expand.‚ÄùColey, David, Tristan Kershaw, and Matt Eames. ‚ÄúA Comparison of Structural and Behavioural Adaptations to Future Proofing Buildings against Higher Temperatures.‚Äù Building and Environment 55 (2012): 159‚Äì66. Print. Image-related processing software should be flexible, adaptable, and programmable to be able to work with several different potential media in the future as well as to handle increasing file sizes. Image-related processing software should also be scalable and embeddable ‚Äì in other words, the use or place where the software is employed is variable and the software needs to accommodate the variable environment. Higher processing integration is required to support future computational requirements in image processing as well.Barreneche, Raul A. ‚ÄúWiring Buildings for the Future.‚Äù Architecture 84.4 (1995): 123‚Äì29. Print. In wireless phone networks, future-proofing of the network hardware and software systems deployed become critical because they are so costly to deploy that it is not economically viable to replace each system when changes in the network operations occur. Telecommunications system designers focus heavily on the ability of a system to be reused and to be flexible in order to continue competing in the marketplace. In 1998, teleradiology (the ability to send radiology images such as x-rays and CAT scans over the internet to a reviewing radiologist) was in its infancy. Doctors developed their own systems, aware that technology would change over time. They consciously included future-proof as one of the characteristics that their investment would need to have. To these doctors, future-proof meant open modular architecture and interoperability so that as technology advanced it would be possible to update the hardware and software modules within the system without disrupting the remaining modules. This draws out two characteristics of future-proofing that are important to the built environment: interoperability and the ability to be adapted to future technologies as they were developed.Roberson, G. H., and Y. Y. Shieh. \\"Radiology Information Systems, Picture Archiving and Communication Systems, Teleradiology ‚Äì Overview and Design Criteria.\\" Journal of Digital Imaging 11.4 (1998): 2‚Äì7. Print. Industrial design In industrial design, future-proofing designs seek to prevent obsolescence by analyzing the decrease in desirability of products. Desirability is measured in categories such as function, appearance, and emotional value. The products with more functional design, better appearance, and which accumulate emotional value faster tend to be retained longer and are considered future-proof. Industrial design ultimately strives to encourage people to buy less by creating objects with higher levels of desirability. Some of the characteristics of future-proof products that come out of this study include a timeless nature, high durability, aesthetic appearances that capture and hold the interest of buyers. Ideally, as an object ages, its desirability is maintained or increases with increased emotional attachment. Products that fit into society's current paradigm of progress, while simultaneously making progress, also tend to have increased desirability.Kerr, Joseph Robert. \\"Future-Proof Design: Must All Good Things Come to an End?\\" M.E.Des. University of Calgary (Canada), 2011. Print. Industrial design teaches that future-proof products are timeless, have high durability, and develop ongoing aesthetic and emotional attraction. Utility systems In one region of New Zealand, Hawke's Bay, a study was conducted to determine what would be required to future-proof the regional economy with specific reference to the water system. The study specifically sought to understand the existing and potential water demand in the region as well as how this potential demand might change with climate change and more intense land use. This information was used to develop demand estimates that would inform the improvements to the regional water system. Future-proofing thus includes forward planning for future development and increased demands on resources. However, the study focuses on future demands almost exclusively and does not address other components of future- proofing such as contingency plans to handle disastrous damage to the system or durability of the materials in the system.Bloomer, Dan, and Phillipa Page. Hawke's Bay Water Demand 2050: a Report for Hawke's Bay Regional Council: Page Bloomer Associates Ltd., 28 February 2012. Print. Climate change and energy conservation The term ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù in relation to sustainable design began to be used in 2007. It has been used more often in sustainable design in relation to energy conservation to minimize the effects of future global temperature rise and/or rising energy costs. By far, the most common use of the term ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù is found in relation to sustainable design and energy conservation in particular. In this context, the term is usually referring to the ability of a structure to withstand impacts from future shortages in energy and resources, increasing world population, and environmental issues, by reducing the amount of energy consumption in the building. Understanding the use of ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù in this field assists in development of the concept of future-proofing as applied to existing structures. In the realm of sustainable environmental issues, future-proof is used generally to describe the ability of a design to resist the impact of potential climate change due to global warming. Two characteristics describe this impact. First, ‚Äúdependency on fossil fuels will be more or less completely eliminated and replaced by renewable energy sources.‚Äù Second, ‚ÄúSociety, infrastructure and the economy will be well adapted to the residual impacts of climate change.‚ÄùGodfrey, Patrick, Jitendra Agarwal, and Priyan Dias. \\"Systems 2030‚ÄìEmergent Themes.\\" (2010). Print. In the design of low energy consuming dwellings, ‚Äúbuildings of the future should be sustainable, low-energy and able to accommodate social, technological, economic and regulatory changes, thus maximizing life cycle value.‚Äù The goal is to ‚Äúreduce the likelihood of a prematurely obsolete building design.‚ÄùGeorgiadou, M. C., T. Hacking, and P. Guthrie. \\"A Conceptual Framework for Future-Proofing the Energy Performance of Buildings.\\" Energy Policy 47 (2012): 145‚Äì55. Print. In Australia, research commissioned by the Health Infrastructure New South Wales explored ‚Äúpractical, cost-effective, design-related strategies for ‚Äúfuture- proofing‚Äù the buildings of a major Australian health department.‚Äù This study concluded that ‚Äúa focus on a whole life-cycle approach to the design and operation of health facilities clearly would have benefits.‚Äù By designing in flexibility and adaptability of structures, one may ‚Äúdefer the obsolescence and consequent need for demolition and replacement of many health facilities, thereby reducing overall demand for building materials and energy.‚ÄùCarthey, Jane, et al. \\"Flexibility: Beyond the Buzzword ‚Äì Practical Findings from a Systematic Literature Review.\\" Health Environments Research and Design Journal 4.4 (Summer 2011): 89‚Äì108. Print. The ability of a building's structural system to accommodate projected climate changes and whether ‚Äúnon-structural [behavioral] adaptations might have a great enough effect to offset any errors from‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶an erroneous choice of climate change projection.‚Äù The essence of the discussion is whether adjustments in the occupant's behavior can future-proof the building against errors in judgment in estimates of the impacts of global climate change. There are clearly many factors involved and the paper does not go into them in exhaustive detail. However, it is clear that ‚Äúsoft adaptations‚Äù such as changes in behavior (such as turning lights off, opening windows for cooling) can have a significant impact on the ability of a building to continue to function as the environment around it changes. Thus adaptability is an important criterion in the concept of future-proofing‚Äù buildings. Adaptability is a theme that begins to come through in many of the other studies on future-proofing.Coley, David, Tristan Kershaw, and Matt Eames. \\"A Comparison of Structural and Behavioural Adaptations to Future Proofing Buildings against Higher Temperatures.\\" Building and Environment 55 (2012): 159‚Äì66. Print. There are examples of sustainable technologies that can be used in existing buildings to take ‚Äúadvantage of up-to-date technologies in the enhancement of the energetic performance of buildings.‚Äù The intent is to understand how to follow the new European Energy Standards to attain the best in energy savings. The subject speaks to historic buildings and specifically of fa√ßade renewal, focusing on energy conservation. These technologies include ‚Äúimprovement of thermal and acoustic performance, solar shadings, passive solar energy systems, and active solar energy systems.‚Äù The main value of this study to future-proofing is not the specific technologies, but rather the concept of working with an existing fa√ßade by overlapping it rather than modifying the existing one. The employment of ventilated facades, double skin glass facades, and solar shadings take advantage of the thermal mass of existing buildings commonly found in Italy. These techniques not only work with thermal mass walls, but also protect damaged and deteriorating historic facades to varying degrees.Brunoro, Silvia. \\"An Assessment of Energetic Efficiency Improvement of Existing Building Envelopes in Italy.\\" Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal 19.6 (2008): 718‚Äì30. Print. Architecture, engineering and construction Use of the term ‚Äúfuture- proofing‚Äù has been uncommon in the AEC industry, especially with relation to historic buildings until recently. In 1997, the MAFF laboratories at York, England were described in an article as ‚Äúfuture-proof‚Äù by being flexible enough to adapt to developing rather than static scientific research. The standard building envelope and MEP services provided could be tailored for each type of research to be performed.Lawson, Bryan. \\"Future Proof: The Maff Laboratories at York.\\" Architecture today.82 (1997): 26‚Äì26. Print. In 2009, ‚Äúfuture-proof‚Äù was used in reference to ‚Äúmegatrends‚Äù that were driving education of planners in Australia.Meng, Lee Lik. \\"Megatrends Driving Planning Education: How Do We Future-Proof Planners?\\" Australian planner 46.1 (2009): 48‚Äì50. Print. A similar term, ‚Äúfatigue proofing,‚Äù was used in 2007 to describe steel cover plates in bridge construction that would not fail due to fatigue cracking.Albrecht, P., and A. Lenwari. \\"Fatigue-Proofing Cover Plates.\\" Journal of Bridge Engineering 12.3 (2007): 275‚Äì83. Print. In 2012, a New Zealand-based organization outlined 8 principles of future-proof buildings: smart energy use, increased health and safety, increased life cycle duration, increased quality of materials and installation, increased security, increased sound control for noise pollution, adaptable spatial design, and reduced carbon footprint.CMS. \\"What Is Future-Proof Building?\\" Construction Marketing Services Limited 2012. Web. 18 November 2013. Another approach to future- proofing suggests that only in more extensive refurbishments to a building should future-proofing be considered. Even then, the proposed time horizon for future-proofing events is 15 to 25 years. The explanation for this particular time horizon for future-proof improvements is unclear.Shah, Sunil. Sustainable Refurbishment. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012. Print. This author believes that time horizons for future-proofing are much more dependent on the potential service life of the structure, the nature of the intervention, and several other factors. The result is that time horizons for future-proof interventions could vary from 15 years (rapidly changing technology interventions) to hundreds of years (major structural interventions). In the valuation of real estate, there are three traditional forms of obsolescence which affect property values: physical, functional, and aesthetic. Physical obsolescence occurs when the physical material of the property deteriorates to the point where it needs to be replaced or renovated. Functional obsolescence occurs when the property is no longer capable of serving the intended use or function. Aesthetic obsolescence occurs when fashions change, when something is no longer in style. A potential fourth form has emerged as well: sustainable obsolescence. Sustainable obsolescence proposes to be a combination of the above forms in many ways. Sustainable obsolescence occurs when a property no longer meets one or more sustainable design goals.Is Sustainability the 4th Form of Obsolescence? PRRES 2010: Proceedings of the Pacific Rim Real Estate Society 16th Annual Conference. 2012. Pacific Rim Real Estate Society (PPRES). Print. Obsolescence is an important characteristic of future-proofing a property because it emphasizes the need for the property to continue to be viable. Though not explicitly stated, the shocks and stresses to a property in the future are one potential way in which a property may become not future-proof. It is also important to note that each form of obsolescence can be either curable or incurable. The separation of curable and incurable obsolescence is ill-defined because the amount of effort one is willing to put into correcting it varies depending on several factors: people, time, budget, availability, etc. However, the most informative realm within the AEC industry is the concept of resiliency. A new buzzword among preservationists and sustainable designers, resiliency has several clearly identified principles. In its common usage, ‚Äúresilience‚Äù describes the ability to recoil or spring back into shape after bending, stretching, or being compressed. In ecology, the term ‚Äúresilience‚Äù the capacity of an ecosystem to tolerate disturbance without collapsing into a qualitatively different state.Applegath, Craig, et al. \\"Resilient Design Principles and Building Design Principles.\\" ResilientCity.org 2010. Web. The principles of a resilient built environment include: * Local materials, parts and labor * Low energy input * High capacity for future flexibility and adaptability of use * High durability and redundancy of building systems * Environmentally responsive design * Sensitivity and responsiveness to changes in constituent parts and environment * High level of diversity in component systems and features One reasonable approach to future-proof sustainable cities is an integrated multi- disciplinary combination of mitigation and adaptation to raise the level of resilience of the city. In the context of urban environments, resilience is less dependent on an exact understanding of the future than on tolerance of uncertainty and broad programs to absorb the stresses that this environment might face. The scale of the context is important in this view: events are viewed as regional stresses rather than local. The intent for a resilient urban environment is to keep many options open, emphasize diversity in the environment, and perform long-range planning that accounts for external systemic shocks.Thornbush, M., O. Golubchikov, and S. Bouzarovski. \\"Sustainable Cities Targeted by Combined Mitigation-Adaptation Efforts for Future-Proofing.\\" Sustainable Cities and Society 9 (2013): 1‚Äì9. Print. Options and diversity are strategies similar to ecological resilience discussed above. This approach again points out the importance of flexibility, adaptability, and diversity to future-proofing urban environments. Historic buildings The design of interventions in existing buildings which are not detrimental to the future of the building may be called ‚Äúfuture-proofing.‚Äù Future-proofing includes the careful consideration of how ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù alterations to historic structures affect the original historic material of the structure. This effect is significant for long service life structures in order to prevent them from deteriorating and being demolished. This effect is especially significant in designated structures where the intent is to do no harm to the historic fabric of the structure. Historic buildings are particularly good candidates for future-proofing because they have already survived for 50 to 100 years or more. Given their performance to date and appropriate interventions, historic building structures are likely to be able to last for centuries. This durability is evident in the buildings of Europe and Asia which have survived centuries and millennia. Extension of the service life of our existing building stock through sensitive interventions reduces energy consumption, decreases material waste, retains embodied energy, and promotes a long-term relationship with our built environment that is critical to the future survival of the human species on this planet. Future-proofing of designated historic structures adds a level of complexity to the concepts of future-proofing in other industries as described above. All interventions on historic structures must comply with the Secretary's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. The degree of compliance and the Standard selected may vary depending on jurisdiction, type of intervention, significance of the structure, and the nature of the intended interventions. The underlying principle is that no harm is done to the structure in the course of the intervention which would damage the structure or make it unavailable to future generations. In addition, it is important that the historic portions of the structure be able to be understood and comprehended apart from the newer interventions.Weeks, Kay D. \\"The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties : With Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring & Reconstructing Historic Buildings.\\" Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Cultural Resource Stewardship and Partnerships, Heritage Preservation Services, 1995. Print.  Infrastructure projects  Future-proofing is also a new methodology to address vulnerabilities of infrastructure systems. For example, analysis of domestic water infrastructure in the Southern California and Tijuana area completed by Rich and Gattuso in 2016Rich, Brian D. and Gattuso, Meghan. 2016. ‚ÄúFuture-Proofing Critical Water Infrastructure from an Economic and Hazard Resilience Perspective.‚Äù Originally published in the Association of Collegiate Schools or Architecture, 104th Annual Meeting Proceeding, Shaping New Knowledges., Seattle, WA.

With changes in the hydrologic conditions due to climate change, there will be increased emphasis on ensuring that the water infrastructure systems continue to function after a natural hazard event where specific components or facilities in the system are compromised.San Diego Regional Water Management Group (RWMG). 2013 San Diego Integrated Regional Water Management Plan: An Update of the 2007 IRWM Plan. http://sdirwmp.org/pdf/SDIRWM_Highlights_Sept2013.pdf and http://sdirwmp.org/pdf/SDIRWM_03_Region_Description_Sep2013.pdf In addition to the aqueducts and pipelines, local or regional infrastructure such as reservoirs, dams, local pipeline systems, pump stations, water treatment, and desalination facilities could be impacted by any of several potential natural hazards. Imported water via aqueducts and pipelines stands as the most significant vulnerability due to the high volumes required, the length of travel, and the nature of the delivery system. Conventional piping infrastructure is at risk for damage in a seismic event as the materials do not generally react well to the shear stresses brought upon by earthquakes. Many new potable water technologies, such as desalination, physical treatment, chemical treatment, and biological treatment systems, can help to address these vulnerabilities. However, development of a future-proof infrastructure system con have longer lasting benefits. The San Diego Regional Water System has been implementing a program of infrastructure improvements to ensure plentiful water sources in the future. These include developed an emergency storage program aimed at providing a 75% service level and includes several key elements of the regional water system. The regional water authority is also in the middle of a multi-decade long project to reline the existing pipeline system to increase their service life (Water-technology.net, 2012). the region also seeks to supplement the water supply through diversification of sources of water which will support continued growth of the regional population. Priorities for development of new water sources (in order of preference) are seawater desalination, indirect potable reuse (wastewater recycling), and additional water from the Colorado River.CDM. 2010. ‚ÄúSection 3: Assessment of Current Conditions.‚Äù ‚ÄúSection 5: Population, Growth and Land use Projections.‚Äù Section 6: Water Demand Projections.‚Äù ‚ÄúSection 9: Development of Water and Wastewater Alternatives.‚Äù Comisi√≥n Estatal de Servicios P√∫blicos de Tijuana. http://www.riversimulator.org/Resources/Mexico/TijuanaWaterSupply.pdf These projects and improvements are examples of ways in which a water infrastructure systems may be developed in a future-proof way while also addressing hazard mitigation concerns, long term adaptive cycles. The strategies being employed in San Diego and Tijuana are future-proofing their potable water infrastructure systems by including seismic loops and flexible oversized systems to prevent damage in seismic events accommodate future changes in use and population growth. The San Diego Regional Water System is pursuing strategies that diversify and increase redundancy of water supplies by including metropolitan water district sources, irrigation water transfer, canal lining to prevent leakage, conservation or reduced consumption, recycled wastewater, desalination, groundwater sources, and surface water sources. Development of new water tunnels and relining water mains, branches, and canals extends the service life, and fortifies the system while reducing physical and functional obsolescence and preventing further deterioration of the system. Ongoing maintenance, diversification efforts, capacity development, and planning for future requirements will ensure an ongoing future-proof supply of water for the region.  Life cycle analysis & life cycle assessment  Life-cycle assessment/Analysis (LCA) can be used as an indicator of long term impacts to the environment, and an important aspect of future-proofing our built environment, quantifying the impacts of initial construction, periodic renovation, and regular maintenance of a building over an extended time span. A study completed published in 2015 by RichRich, Brian D. Future-Proof Building Materials: A Life Cycle Analysis. Intersections and Adjacencies. Proceedings of the 2015 Building Educators‚Äô Society Conference, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. Gines, Jacob, Carraher, Erin, and Galarze, Jose, editors. Pp. 123‚Äì130. compares the impacts of gymnasiums constructed of different building materials over a 200-year period using the Athena Impact Estimator. Rich developed the phrase \\"First Impacts\\" to describe the environmental impacts of new construction from raw material extraction to occupancy of the building. When the environmental impacts of maintenance and replacement are considered with first impacts for a building, a complete picture of the environmental impacts are formed. While choice of materials is important to initial impacts of a building or product, less durable materials lead to more frequent maintenance, operating expenses and replacement. By contrast, more durable materials may have more significant initial impacts, but those impacts will pay off in the long run by reducing maintenance, repairs, and operations expenses. Durability of all components of a building system should have equivalent service lives or allow for disassembly in order to maintain the shorter service life materials. This allows retention of materials that have longer service lives rather than disposing of them when removed to perform maintenance. Proper maintenance of a building is critical to long term service life because it prevents deterioration of less durable materials that can expose additional materials to deterioration.

She told the press, \\"I've got to be The Simpsons' No. 1 fan, so taking part was almost as much fun as appearing in a blockbuster movie.\\"\\"TV week\\". The Sun. November 18, 2000. The TV Mag, 3. The episode features references to Bob Hope's famous USO shows. The episode has also received negative reviews from critics. Plot Homer and Bart use fireworks to accomplish things Marge has told them to do: fix a stuck shelf, demolishing Santa's Little Helper's doghouse (while promising him another one would be built by January 2007), and attempting to fix Lisa's VCR, but end up destroying her room with fireworks instead. To make it up to her, the family spends a day at the Springfield Festival of Books for her birthday. There, they encounter famous authors such as Stephen King, Tom Wolfe, John Updike, and Amy Tan. While waiting in line for an autograph from Krusty, Bart strikes up a conversation with a girl named Sophie. When she gets to the front of the line, she reveals to Krusty that she is his daughter. Sophie tells Krusty that he met her mother when she served as a soldier in the Gulf War, spending the night with her after a USO show; however, she dumped Krusty the next day after he ruined her attempted assassination of Saddam Hussein. Krusty proves a distant and unemotional father, and on a trip to the beach, he sees Homer playing with the kids and asks him for advice on how to be a good parent. Krusty and his daughter begin to bond, and Sophie shows Krusty her prized violin and plays a song for him. That night, Krusty plays in a poker game with Fat Tony, where he is dealt four aces with a king kicker, but is forced to bet Sophie's violin after running out of money and betting his Rolex watch, and loses the hand to Fat Tony, who had a straight flush (2-3-4-5-6 of diamonds). Sophie loses her trust in Krusty upon hearing the news, and Krusty turns to Homer for help; the two attempt to break into Fat Tony's mansion while a mafia summit is being held. They find a room filled with violin cases, but most of them are filled with weapons. They attempt to sneak out with the cases, but they fall to the ground and a mob shootout erupts around them; Krusty finds the violin, and the two escape. The next day, Krusty gives the violin back to Sophie, who is delighted to find that the case has been lined with money. Production Don Payne (pictured) and John Frink originally wrote the episode for season 11. The episode was written by John Frink and Don Payne and features guest stars Jay Mohr as Christopher Walken, Stephen King as himself, Amy Tan as herself, John Updike as himself and Joe Mantegna as recurring character Fat Tony. Drew Barrymore also guest-starred as Krusty the Clown's daughter in the episode. Fat Tony would later appear in the critically acclaimed \\"Trilogy of Error\\". The episode went into a cycle where it was written in season 11 and produced for season 12. Originally, Homer Simpson was the one who was surprised to have a long-lost daughter, but this was changed to Krusty as a suggestion from Mike Scully. During production Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge Simpson, went to Stephen King's radio station to record lines. Ian Maxtone-Graham was the one who suggested Jay Mohr as the real Christopher Walken could not make it to the recording. Some sources suggest Christopher Walken originally agreed to appear as himself. However, he then decided to demand a lot more money than the producers were willing to pay. Instead, Jay Mohr provided the voice of Walken. In the end credits, Jay Mohr is credited with the voice of Christopher Walken, and the credit says \\"Jay Mohr as Christopher Walken\\". This is the first time this has ever been done. Cultural references The episode title is a play on the Detroit, Michigan based hip hop group, the Insane Clown Posse, and Krusty's line \\"do you want to get down with the clown?\\" is a reference to an Insane Clown Posse lyric. Krusty's performance at the USO show is a parody of Bob Hope who is famously known for his USO Shows. Originally Moe was supposed to say \\"Anny Deskanko\\" in a reference to Ani Difranco. As in some previous episodes, there is a song featuring NRBQ. Fat Tony's real name is Marion, as was the late actor John Wayne. In one scene, Krusty comes in with a problem and Homer asks Marge to play \\"devil's advocate\\". However, instead of taking up an argument, the next scene shows Homer playing a pinball game called \\"Devil's Advocate\\". Reception John Updike liked being on the show and tried not to laugh in the recording. The episode has received negative reviews from critics. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a negative review saying \\"After two pretty good shows, Season 12 encounters mediocrity with ‚ÄúPoppy‚Äù. At no point does the program become poor, but it just lacks many real laughs. Outside of some amusing book fair cameos, this one fails to deliver much zing, and it tends to drag.\\" Mark Naglazas of The West Australian called the episode \\"disappointing\\". He remarked that it and \\"A Tale of Two Springfields\\" (which premiered the same night in Australia) were \\"so surreal they would have Salvador Dal√≠ scratching his head\\". However, he identified John Updike's guest appearance as an example of \\"sophisticated comedy\\".Mark Naglazas. \\"End of an era?\\" The West Australian. February 14, 2001. 4. The Daily Telegraph said, \\"The episode gets lost in a quagmire of guest stars. The names range from the sublime to the ridiculous, or to be exact, from Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Updike to actor Drew Barrymore. The script seems designed only to fit in as many big names as possible.

Updike exclaimed vigorously, \\"I can't claim to be a morbidly avid fan, but I'm basically well-disposed toward The Simpsons, and was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they work into the endless saga of Springfield. . . . It was the kind of invitation to which you can't say no. I did notice that Amy Tan and Stephen King got many more lines in the episode than I did.\\" He joked that he struggled with the chuckle he had to perform in the episode, saying, \\"How do you chuckle over a microphone. . . to make it worthy of The Simpsons?\\"John Updike and James A.

Mary of Clopas (, Mar√≠a hƒì tou Cl≈çp√°), was one of the women present at the crucifixion of Jesus and bringing supplies for his funeral. The expression Mary of Clopas in the Greek text is ambiguous as to whether Mary was the daughter or wife of Clopas, but exegesis has commonly favoured the reading \\"wife of Clopas\\". Hegesippus identified Clopas as a brother of Saint Joseph. In the Roman Martyrology she is remembered with Saint Salome on April 24. Appearances in the gospels Mary of Clopas is explicitly mentioned only in , where she is among the women present at the crucifixion of Jesus: The Gospels of Mark and Matthew each include similar passages that are nearly identical to one another: This has led some scholars to identify Mary of Clopas with \\"Mary the mother of James and Joseph/Joses\\". The Gospels of Matthew () and Mark () mention James and Joseph/Joses (with Mark always using the less common variation \\"Joses\\") among the four brothers of Jesus. According to some interpretations, the same Mary was also among the women that on resurrection morning went to the tomb to anoint the body of Jesus with spices. calls her \\"the other Mary\\" to distinguish her from Mary Magdalene, while uses the name \\"Mary, the mother of James\\" (Maria Iacobi in Latin). Apocryphal writings In a manner very similar to the Gospel of John, the apocryphal Gospel of Philip (3rd century) also seems to list Mary of Clopas among Jesus' female entourage: Adding to the confusion, the Gospel of Philip seems to refer to her as Jesus' mother's sister (\\"her sister\\") and Jesus' own sister (\\"his sister\\"). The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew (7th century) presents Mary of Cleophas as the daughter of Cleophas and Anna: Mary of Clopas with children, by Adriaen van Overbeke Identity of Clopas The expression Mary of Clopas in the Greek text is ambiguous as to whether Mary was the daughter or wife of Clopas, but exegesis has commonly favoured the reading \\"wife of Clopas\\". Clopas appears in early Christian writings as a brother of Joseph, and as the father of Simeon, the second bishop of Jerusalem. Eusebius of Caesarea, referencing the works of Hegesippus, relates in his Church History (Book III, ch. 11), that after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, the Christians of Jerusalem: This identification would make Mary of Clopas a sister-in-law of Mary, the mother of Jesus, possibly explaining the wording \\"His mother‚Äôs sister, Mary of Clopas\\" in . Clopas was sometimes further identified with Cleopas and Alphaeus, father of James, one of the Twelve Apostles. In 1982, Stephen S. Smalley, Dean Emeritus of Chester Cathedral, deemed this identification \\"probable\\"S. S. Smalley. \\"Mary,\\" New Bible Dictionary, 1982 p. 793. In medieval tradition, Clopas was identified as this Mary's father and the second husband of Saint Anne and the father of \\"Mary of Clopas\\", allowing Mary to be identified as the half-sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary of Clopas and the brothers of Jesus Jerome (347-420), writing Against Helvidius in defense of perpetual virginity of the mother of Jesus, argued that the brothers of Jesus (James, Simon, Jude, and Joses or Joseph) were children of Mary of Clopas, the sister of the mother of Jesus, making them first cousins of Jesus. Jerome also identified James, the brother of Jesus, with the Apostle James, son of Alphaeus and thus supposed that Mary of Clopas was married to Alphaeus. This view finds support in a fragment found in a medieval manuscript, which lists four Maries mentioned in the gospels and bears the inscription \\"Papia\\" on the margin. The attribution of this fragment to Papias of Hierapolis (ca. 70-163 AD) however has been disputed in favour of a medieval author (possibly Papias the lexicographer, fl. 1040s‚Äì1060s) by Anglican bishops and theologians J.B. Lightfoot (1828-1889) and Brooke Foss Westcott (1825‚Äì1901). James Tabor deduced that \\"Mary the mother of James and Joses\\" is none other than Mary, the mother of Jesus herself. This interpretation would necessitate that Mary the mother of Jesus married a man named Clopas, after her marriage to Joseph (perhaps after his death). Tabor proposes that a brother of Joseph would have been obliged to wed his widowed wife in a Levirate marriage, despite this only being permissible if the first marriage had been childless.

History  The line was built between 1863 and 1865 as the Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway, part of the Caledonian Railway. It opened to goods traffic (mainly coal and iron) in September 1865 and to passengers in August 1866. It has been in continuous operation ever since. Stations in the first service on the line were at Carmyle, Broomhouse (now Mount Vernon), Baillieston, Langloan and Whifflet High Level (until 1964). Passenger services ceased in November 1966 following the Beeching Axe (latterly running to ). Between 1972 and 1974 scheduled passenger trains between Glasgow Central and Perth used the route. For the following twenty years, the route was only used for freight and diverted passenger services. However the line was reopened by British Rail to scheduled passenger services with intermediate stations on 4 October 1993, running to the newly built station at Whifflet rather than Coatbridge Central as previously.  Line description  The modern line currently serves seven stations. It connects parts of south east Glasgow, Bargeddie and Coatbridge to Glasgow city centre. Between and Rutherglen, the line shares the same track as the West Coast Main Line (and is hence electrified) before branching off in a north easterly direction towards Coatbridge (this section is now electrified).  Services  The route is operated by Abellio ScotRail. = 1993 to 2002 = Following re- opening as a passenger line, service was provided by a mix of 1980s Class 156 and 1950s Class 101 DMUs. During their final years, the last of BR ScotRail's power-twin Class 101 2-car DMUs, reduced from 3-car by having the centre trailer removed, operated the Whifflet and Paisley Canal lines almost exclusively, based at Corkerhill Depot. In 2002 the remaining 101s were sent South to Manchester and more modern units took over the services. = 2009 service pattern = Trains operated at a half-hour frequency. All services were scheduled to run as two car trains only, although four carriage services were technically possible. Services were operated using Class 158 DMUs and the occasional Class 156 DMU. Three trains operated on this route during the day, usually remaining dedicated on this service throughout the day. = From December 2014 = In late 2014, the Whifflet Line electrification was commissioned and from 14 December 2014 the service was incorporated into the Argyle Line, operated by EMUs. At the same time an all year round Sunday service commenced. Except on Sundays where services run between Dalmuir/Milngavie to Rutherglen.  Line Developments  In 2006, Network Rail announced tentative proposals to electrify the Rutherglen - Whifflet section, as part of a ¬£1.4bn upgrade to Scotland's railways. The main benefits of this scheme were to provide an enhanced frequency for the Whifflet to central Glasgow routes and to provide an electric diversionary path for long distance WCML services. The new timetable came into operation on 14 December 2014, the Whifflet Line has been added to the Argyle Line system with services through Glasgow Central Low Level to the western suburbs.

Umay resembles earth-mother goddesses found in various other world religions. Etymology In Mongolian, Umai means 'womb' or 'uterus'. The earth was considered a \\"mother\\" symbolically. The Turkic root umƒÅy originally meant 'placenta, afterbirth', and this word was used as the name for the goddess whose function was to look after women and children, possibly because the placenta was thought to have magic qualities. Literally in the Mongolian language, \\"eje\\" or \\"eej\\" means \\"mother,\\" and in Old Turkic, the word e√ße also means 'mother'.  Goddess of Children  The name appeared in the 8th-century inscription of Kul Tigin in the phrase Umay teg √∂g√ºm katun kutƒ±≈ãa 'under the auspices of my mother who is like the goddess Umay'. Umay is a protector of women and children. The oldest evidence is seen in the Orkhon script monuments. From these it is understood that Umay was accepted as a mother and a guide. Also, khagans were thought to represent K√∂k Tengri. Khagan wives, katuns or hatuns, were considered Umays, too. With the help of 'Umay, katuns had babies, and these babies were the guarantee of the empire. According to Divan√º L√ºgat‚Äôit-T√ºrk, when women worship Umay, they have male babies. Turkic women tie strings attached with small cradles to will a baby from Umay. This belief can be seen with the Tungusic peoples in Southern Siberia and the Altay people. Umay is always depicted together with a child. There are only rare exceptions to this. It is believed that when Umay leaves a child for a long time, the child gets ill and shamans are involved to call Umay back. The smiling of a sleeping baby shows Umay is near it and crying means that Umay has left. In the view of the Kyrgyz people, Umay not only protects children, but also Turkic communities around the world. At the same time Umay helps people to obtain more food and goods and gives them luck. As Umay is associated with the sun, she is called Sarƒ± Kƒ±z 'Yellow Maiden', and yellow is her colour and symbol. She is depicted as having sixty golden tresses that look like the rays of the sun. She is thought to have once been identical with Ot Ene of the Mongols and Altay. Umay and Ece are also used as female given names in the Republic of Turkey.

She was named after an ancient city of Axum in Ethiopia. Design and description The Adua-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding . They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of .Chesneau, pp. 309‚Äì10 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the Adua class had a range of at , submerged, they had a range of at .Bagnasco, p. 154 The boats were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns. Construction and career thumb Axum was built at the CRDA shipyard, in Monfalcone. She was laid down on 8 February 1936, launched on 27 September of the same year, and commissioned on 2 December 1936. On March 20, 1937 after a brief training, she was assigned to 23rd Submarine Squadron in Naples. Between August 27 and September 5, 1937 she performed a secret mission on behalf of the Spanish Nationalists in the Strait of Sicily but did not detect any targets.Axum at Monfalcone Naval Museum Between 1937 and 1940 the submarine underwent intensive training out of her base in Naples. In 1940 Axum was assigned to 71st Squadron (VII Submarine Group) in Cagliari, but her operational base continued to be Naples. After Italy's entrance into World War II she was mainly operating in the western Mediterranean. In June 1940 she was deployed south of Sardinia. On 4‚Äì5 July 1940 Axum patrolled of the coast of northern Algeria. On 9‚Äì11 July 1940 she was relocated to patrol off the island of La Galite, then moved southwest of the island of Sant'Antioco. In the afternoon of November 9, 1940 Axum left Cagliari and was sent to patrol off the island of La Galite along with four other submarines (including Alagi and Aradam) as a screen to the British Operation \\"Coat\\". Later the same day, shortly after 19:00, she detected engine noises but the distance was far too great to attempt an attack. On November 12, 1940, she again detected weak noises through her hydrophones, but again the distant was far too great to attempt an attack. On November 27, 1940, while patrolling south of Sardinia, at 21:35 she sighted three destroyers and submerged to avoid detection. In January 1941 she was deployed to the coast of Algeria and Tunisia. On June 16, 1941, Axum, under command of captain Emilio Gariazzo, was sent to patrol between Ras Uleima, and Marsa Matruh to prevent coastal bombardments by British naval ships conducted in support British troops retreat. On June 20, 1941, received orders to move closer to Benghazi. On June 23, 1941, around 22:26 she sighted a ship heading west and launched a torpedo, but it missed due to irregular running. Axum launched a second torpedo, but it also missed the ship, passing a few meters by the stern. The ship returned fire and the submarine was forced to dive and get through a brief but intense depth charge attack, without suffering any damage. During 19‚Äì28 July 1941 she got posted off Tobruk and detected intense aerial and naval activity, but there were no attacks. After that Axum was relocated to Leros. Upon arrival and surfacing, she was mistaken for an enemy submarine, and a MAS boat attacked her with machine guns and a torpedo. Fortunately, Axum was not hit, and no one was wounded or killed. Subsequently, she was transferred first to Messina, and then in September to Cagliari. In September 1941 Axum was deployed to an area east of Balearic Islands and south of Menorca together with three other submarines (Aradam, Diaspro and Serpente) to intercept British ships during Operation Halberd, but British ships did not pass through her area of operation. On October 24, 1941, she patrolled in the waters of Malta. In December 1941 she patrolled in the area off Cape Bougaroun. On January 4, 1942 Axum was deployed to an area south of Malta with the task of detecting and attacking any British naval forces, but no sightings were made. In February 1942 she patrolled off the coast of Algeria. In mid- June 1942 she was deployed in the Ionian Sea, then transferred to patrol northwest of Algiers. On June 22, 1942 she was transferred to patrol off Linosa. In July 1942 Axum, under command of captain Renato Ferrini, was on patrol between the island of Cani and the island of La Galite, and in the late afternoon of July 15, six miles east of the Cani Island, sighted moving rapidly in the direction of Malta. At 20:00, Axum launched three electric torpedoes, but failed to hit the ship because of the bad weather and rough seas. In mid-August 1942, Axum was assigned with many other submarines to intercept a British convoy, part of Operation Pedestal. Altogether, fifteen Italian submarines and two German U-Boots were deployed in the western Mediterranean with the orders to attack any enemy ship greater than a destroyer. On August 11, 1942, the submarine, commanded by captain Renato Ferrini, left Cagliari heading to an area 25 miles northwest of Cape Blanc, where he arrived the following day. At 6:00 on August 12, Axum left his assigned area, and at 14:00 Commander Ferrini, believing that the convoy would be going a lot closer to the coast, keeping their escorts to the north, ordered full ahead towards Cape Blanc while under water. At 18:21 a silhouette of the convoy was observed. At 18:40 Axum observed fumes on the right which were produced by the anti-aircraft guns engaging two airplanes. Axum continued her approach, and at 19:27, she observed through a periscope that the convoy about eight kilometers to her left. At 19:37 a new observation showed that the distance had dropped to 4,000 meters, and convoy was moving at 13 knots. Another periscope observation was done at 19:48, and a cruiser was selected as a target, and at 19:55, from an estimated distance of 1,300 meters from the first row of the convoy and 1,800 meters from the target cruiser, Axum launched a salvo of all four torpedoes: first was sent straight, second, 5¬∞ to the right, third 5¬∞ to the left, and finally last one, straight. Immediately Axum disengaged. 63 seconds after the launch, an explosion was heard, after 27 more seconds, two more, one after another. Captain Ferrini thought he had hit a ship in the first row and another one in the second row, but in reality three ships were hit. HMS Nigeria listing after being hit by Axums torpedo The first torpedo struck modern light cruiser , flagship of Admiral Harold Burrough (Commander of Force X), moving at 14 knots. The explosion opened a 30-foot-wide hole, knocking out electricals, flooding the boiler rooms and knocking out pumps, and starting fires on board. Fifty-two crew members lost their lives. The ship started listing on the left, but the crew managed to stabilize the cruiser and was able to turn around and head to Gibraltar accompanied by three destroyers. Admiral Burrough had to be taken off the cruiser and moved on board of destroyer . safely made it back to Gibraltar, where she stayed for over a year undergoing repairs returning to action in September 1943.Giorgerini, pp. 333-337-338 Two torpedoes then struck moving at 8 knots, blowing off the stern with one of the propellers, killing 24 crew members. After the crew was evacuated, (376 survivors) was scuttled with gunfire by . Finally, the fourth torpedo struck tanker , causing heavy damage. It was probably the most important merchant ship of the convoy, being the only oil tanker carrying fuel for Malta. Within twenty minutes, the tanker's crew was able to extinguish the fires and continue at 13 knots despite damage. The ship was hit by several bombs on her journey, but the superhuman determination of her crew, and support of several destroyers that guarded her, allowed SS Ohio to reach Malta on 15 August 1942. After unloading fuel, SS Ohio finally sank, breaking in two in Malta's harbor. After four and half minutes after torpedo launch, escorts went on offensive. Axum was at 65 meters when the depth charge attack started, and captain Ferrini took the boat down to 100 meters. The hunt continued for roughly 2 hours and 60 depth charges were thrown. At 22:50 Axum surfaced to observe the damage and assess the situation. Noting enemy's destroyers in the distance, Axum submerged and went north. She surfaced again at 1:30 on August 14. The damage sustained by the submarine prevented her from diving below 40 meters; nevertheless, Axum stayed in the area patrolling for the next 2 days, and returned to Trapani on August 15, 1942, at 19:30. In October and November 1942 she patrolled off Balearic Islands. On November 7, 1942, she sighted enemy ships, but got detected and had to dive and withstand a barrage of depth charges which caused some damage. On November 9 Axum left the patrol area and headed back to the base due to sustained damage. In February 1943 she patrolled in the Gulf of Sirte but did not encounter any traffic. On April 11, 1943, while sailing in a violent storm off the coast of Sardinia, sustained flooding and lost the use of both of her periscopes forcing her to abandon her mission and return to the base. On July 21, 1943 Axum while proceeding from La Spezia to La Maddalena, was spotted in the position , five miles northwest of Calvi, by the British Submarine . Templar fired a total of seven torpedoes over the course of several attacks but they all missed the target. At the announcement of the armistice, on September 8, 1943 Axum (under command of captain Vittorio Barra) was in Gaeta to carry out repair work on diesel engines. Early on September 9, 1943, Germans tried to capture ships in the harbor, and at 2:15 Axum managed to get away with only one engine running. Captain Barra took the boat to island of Montecristo where the submarine spent a night. On September 10, 1943, she reached Portoferraio, and from there proceeded to Palermo. After repairs in Palermo, she sailed to Malta. On October 9, 1943, she left Malta for Taranto where she underwent further repairs including to her second engine. For the rest of the war, Axum was used only to infiltration missions (bringing and taking spies and sabotage teams from German-occupied territories). During one of those missions, on December 25, 1943 Axum, under command of captain Giovanni Sorrentino, left Taranto to recover spies from the Gulf of Kyparissia. In the evening of December 27, Axum arrived at the rendezvous point on the west coast of Morea.

The Dagpo Kagyu are the lineage of Tilopa through his student Naropa, often traced through Naropa's famous student Marpa Lotsawa and thus called \\"Marpa Kagyu\\", while the Shangpa lineage descends from Tilopa's student Niguma, who was Naropa's sister,Niguma StorySarah Harding. Niguma, Lady of Illusion. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 3-6 as well as from the teachings of Sukhasiddhi. Its founder was Khyungpo Nenjor, the student of both women, whose monastery in the Shang Valley gave its name to the tradition. The principal Shangpa dharmapala is the six-armed MahƒÅkƒÅla. The Shangpa tradition was revitalized in the 20th century by the first Kalu Rinpoche, who had many students both in Tibet and in the West. Origins The Shangpa Kagyu lineage was founded by the eleventh-century Tibetan scholar Khyungpo Nenjor.khyung po rnal 'byor ( b. 978/990 d. 1127 ) Seeking to increase his understanding of the teachings he received in Tibet, he traveled to India, where he met the female mystic yogini, Niguma.ni gu ma (b. 10th cent.) (Vajradhara Niguma is the full Tibetan name of the Indian yogini Vimalashri.Niguma @khandro.net He received many teachings from her; in particular, the teachings of a special tradition of Mahamudra and the Six Yogas of Niguma, which are similar but not identical to the Six Dharmas of Naropa. Khyungpo Nenjor was a Tibetan yogi and Bonpo and Niguma's most famous disciple. He was the only one to whom she imparted her most secret teachings.Druk Gawa Khilwa Abbey He also met and studied with the dakini Sukhasiddhi,Indian Teacher - Sukhasiddhi another female mystic and student of the mahasiddha Vir≈´pa, as well as VajrƒÅsana, Maitripada, RƒÅhula, and others. Thang Tong Gyalpo TBRC P2778 was another famous yogi instructed by Niguma in a vision. He started his own religious tradition () within the Shangpa Kagyu lineage. On his return to Tibet, Khyungpo Neljor established a monastery at Shang in Tsang. This was his main seat, and he became known as the Lama of Shang. Although he was reputed to have founded hundreds of monasteries and had thousands of students, he passed the teachings of Niguma to only one of his students, Mochok Rinchen Tsondru. The Shangpa lineage is often referred to as the \\"secret lineage\\" because Niguma instructed Khyungpo Neljor to transmit the teachings to only one student for the first seven generations beginning with Vajradhara and Niguma. From Mochok Rinchen Tsondru, the lineage was passed to Kyergang Chokyi Senge, Nyenton Rigung Chokyi Sherab, and Songjay Tenpa Tsondru Senge. These first seven teachings are known as the Seven Great Jewels of the Shangpa tradition. Songjay Tenpa was the first teacher who gave these instructions to more than one of his disciples, and from this point on, several different lines of transmission developed. The intention for keeping the lineage secret in this fashion was to protect it from becoming an established monastic tradition. As one of the more esoteric traditions, it was meant to be practiced rather than codified. Although the Shangpa teachings were highly regarded and were assimilated by many schools, the tradition itself ceased to exist as an independent school with the dissolution of the Jonangpas in the 17th century. However, its teachings were still practiced and transmitted. In the 19th century Jamgon Kongtrul gathered together the surviving transmissions and ensured their continued survival by including them in his Treasury of Key Instructions. The lineage transmission has also been incorporated into the Sakya school and other Kagyu schools. Je Tsongkhapa, who founded the Gelug school, was also versed in the doctrine of the Shangpa Kagyu. = Modern lineage holders = In the west, the principal teacher of the Shangpa Kagyu lineage was the first Kalu Rinpoche. He received the lineage teachings in the early 1940s when he went for training at Tsa Tsa Monastery in Eastern Tibet. He trained with the Abbot of the monastery, the 8th Tsa Tsa Drubgen, Yizhin Norbu, also called Karma Singhe and the White Crown Master. The Karma Kagyu regent Tai Situpa described Yizhin Norbu as ‚Äúone of the most learned and accomplished Kagyu masters now living.‚Äù There, Kalu Rinpoche received the complete cycle of the Shangpa teachings during a closed retreat. Tsa Tsa monastery is also a major Dakpo Kagyu Centre and preserves the Rim√© movement. The Tsa Tsa Drubgen Yizhin Norbu died in the middle of June, 2005. The Shangpa traditions are currently held by his regent and successor the second Gyalten Thongwa Rangdrol. After the first Kalu Rinpoche died his student Bokar Tulku Rinpoche became the main lineage holder. After Bokar Tulku Rinpoche died, Yangsi Kalu, a young tulku who finished a Shangpa three-year retreat in September 2008, became the holder of the seat of the lineage (the monastery of Sonada in northern India). The other current holders of the Shangpa lineage are the lamas who have been entrusted by Vajradhara Kalu Rangjung K√ºnchab, for example Norla Rinpoche, Denys Rinpoche, as well as Ven Mogchok Rinpoche currently living and teaching in France. A list of Kalu Rangjung Kunchab contemporary heirs is available on Shangpa Resource center web Site Wangchen Rinpoche is a current lineage holder, who was recognized by Dorje Chang Kalu Rinpoche as ‚ÄúKalu the Younger‚Äù, his meditation companion in Tibet.. Practice and doctrine There are many unique teachings in the Shangpa tradition, but the most important are \\"The Five Golden Teachings\\", also called the Five Golden Doctrines of the Shangpas (), a group of teachings envisioned as forming a tree,.Samdrub Darjay Choling Monastery web siteShangpa, Shang-pa # The innermost teachings are the \\"Six Yogas of Niguma\\" or more properly called \\"Six Dharmas of Niguma\\" ( which are very similar to the Six Yogas of Naropa practiced by the Dagpo schools. The Six Dharmas of Niguma include the teachings on heat, illusory-body, the dream state, sheer clarity, transference, and bardo (the intermediary state between death and birth) # The next tier includes \\"The Locket Tradition of Mahamudra\\" which combines the mahamudra teachings of Niguma, Maitripa, and Sukhasiddhi. # The teachings on the three methods of carrying one's understanding from meditation into daily activities. # The practice of development and completion with the white and red dakinis. # The teaching of the deathless nature of mind and body.

Early career  Lamsdorf was the son of a career officer in the Imperial Russian Army and attended the Page Corps as a youth.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 200-201. As with many other Russian diplomats, he attended the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum in St. Petersburg and began his career as a government bureaucrat in 1866. At the Berlin Congress he was in the retinue of Prince Alexander Gorchakov, the Chancellor of the Russian Empire. In 1884 the young diplomat was present at the meeting of Alexander III of Russia, Wilhelm I of Prussia and Franz Josef of Austria in Skierniewice and Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ. Gorchakov's successor, Nicholas de Giers, singled out Lamsdorf as his prot√©g√© and prospective successor. During the 1880s, he was a vocal supporter of the Three Emperors' League but shifted his views after Bismarck's resignation in 1890. In 1897 he was appointed Deputy Foreign Minister. He played a major role at the First Hague Peace Conference of 1899. There was a fair degree of continuity in policies when he succeeded Mikhail Muraviev three years later in 1900.  Foreign Minister  Lamsdorf's main concerns revolved around the Eastern Question and the proposed administrative reform of the Ottoman Empire towards strengthening and protecting Russia's position in the Balkans. In late 1902 he personally visited Belgrade, Sofia and Vienna to discuss the Balkan impasse with Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, Hristo Tatarchev, Agenor Maria Go≈Çuchowski, and their monarchs. In September 1903 he accompanied Tsar Nicholas II to Vienna and M√ºrzzuschlag. Lamsdorf was anxious to prevent the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the face of Slavic nationalism and emphatically condemned the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising and other activities of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. He was also sympathetic to the Zionist cause, as promoted by Theodor Herzl.Friedman, Isaiah. Germany, Turkey, and Zionism 1897-1918. Transaction Publishers, 1997. . Page 116. Lamsdorf did not share the Tsar's position that Russia was destined to rule East Asia, and cooperated with Finance Minister Sergey Witte and War Minister Aleksey Kuropatkin to curtail the influence of the Bezobrazov Circle over the Tsar. He proposed to relinquish Russia's commercial and industrial enterprises in Korea to obtain an agreement with Japan, in order to safeguard her interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway and avoid complications with Great Britain. However, he was steadily sidelined by the jingoist hard-liners from the military, especially after the appointment of Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev as Viceroy of the Far East and events continued their downward spiral towards war, with Lamsdorf seemingly resigned to its inevitability. As a result of the Russo-Japanese War, the Korean minister (ambassador) to Russia was left without orders or funding. Other diplomats lent him some money, and Vladimir Lamsdorf instructed that the Korean minister be funded for the duration of the conflict; in gratitude, the Korean minister \\"hastened to subscribe five pounds to the Russian fleet fund\\". Lee W. Stanley portrays this scenario in two panels: on the left, the minister shows his empty pockets and declares himself \\"brokio\\" (that is, 'broke', or without money); on the right, he sits among several bags of money with his feet on the desk and offers a five-pound note to a bearded man representing Russia. Note the pen and inkwell on the desk, indicating that he has just written a cheque, and the champagne bucket on the floor indicating that he is now wealthy. The main event of Lamsdorf's tenure in office was the Russo-Japanese War. During the war, Lamsdorf was to a large degree overshadowed by the stronger personality of his close associate, Count Sergey Witte. Together they negotiated the Treaty of Portsmouth, only to learn, upon their return to St. Petersburg, that the Tsar had secretly signed the Treaty of Bj√∂rk√∂ with Imperial Germany. It was owing to their efforts that the projected Russian-German alliance against Britain never came into effect. This earned Lamsdorf the enmity of both German government and press. If the Tsar had not listened to the arguments of Witte and Lamsdorf, \\"the whole history of Europe and of the world could have been different\\".Quoted from: Mombauer, Annika; Deist, Wilhelm. The Kaiser: New Research on Wilhelm II's Role in Imperial Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2003. Page 119. Lamsdorf was instrumental in Russia's support of France in the Moroccan Crisis of 1906 against Germany, which was a step towards the creation of the Triple Entente. When eventually relieved of his duties in 1906, Lamsdorf prided himself on having maintained a position equidistant from both Potsdam and Buckingham Palace. He compared Russia's standing in Europe to \\"that of a rich bride which none wanted to see fall into the arms of another\\".Quoted from: White, John Albert. Transition to Global Rivalry: Alliance Diplomacy and the Quadruple Entente, 1895-1907. Cambridge University Press, 1995. Page 84. Lamsdorf's decidedly cool attitude to both British and German empires was demonstrated by his handling of the Dogger Bank incident and the Treaty of Bj√∂rk√∂.  Personality  Lamsdorf was described by his contemporaries as a \\"leisurely, well-bred man of good society... with a very high forehead and a soft affable manner\\". He never married and fathered no children. Rumors about his sexual orientation were often exploited by his enemies to undermine his authority at court. A characteristic excerpt from Suvorin's diary: \\"The Tsar calls Lamsdorf madame and promotes his lover Savitsky within the ranks of the count. Lamsdorf boasts that he spent thirty years in the corridors of the Foreign Ministry. As he is a homosexual and all men are for him sluts, he thus spent thirty years in a bordello\\".Quoted from: Alexander Poznansky. Tchaikovsky's Last Days: A Documentary Study. Oxford University Press, 1996. . Page 5. At his resignation, Lamsdorf was admitted into the State Council of Imperial Russia but chose to spend the few remaining months of his life on the Italian Riviera, where he died (in San Remo) at the age of 62.

Trains on the new line would have had to use the single track connection from Langloan West Junction to reach Coatbridge and the use of single lead junctions for new services was discouraged at the time following two recent fatal accidents in the area (at Bellgrove and Newton) involving such layouts. Re-doubling this stretch of line wasn't considered to be economically justifiable, so a route using the double line curve to Whifflet North was chosen, with the station acting as the new terminus for the route in addition to serving the local area. It has also been a stop on the Motherwell to Cumbernauld Line since the route began operating in 1996 and is now served by Argyle Line electric trains between Motherwell and Cumbernauld via Coatbridge Central, the line through here having been wired in 1981 to provide access to the container terminal at Gartsherrie for electrically-hauled freight trains (and subsequently extended north through to Cumbernauld in May 2014 as part of the Cumbernauld Line electrification scheme).

Standard left hand campdrafting course, once the steer or heifer is cut out This competitor has lost control of his beast. Campdrafting is a unique Australian sport involving a horse and rider working cattle. The riding style is Australian stock, somewhat akin to American Western riding and the event is similar to the American stock horse events such as cutting, working cow horse, team penning, and ranch sorting. In a campdrafting competition, a rider on horseback must \\"cut out\\" one beast from the mob of cattle in the yard or the \\"camp\\" and block and turn the beast at least two or three times to prove to the judge that they have the beast under control; then take it out of the yard and through a course around pegs involving right and left hand turns in a figure eight, before guiding it through two pegs known as \\"the gate\\". The outside course must be completed in less than 40 seconds. Events for juniors 8 years and under 13 years have one sound beast in the camp or yard at all times. In other events it is recommended that there shall be a minimum of six head of sound stock in the camp at any time. Up to a total of 100 points are scored by horse and rider: \\"Cut out\\" is worth a total of 26 points; horse work up to a further 70 points; and 4 points for the course. Most disqualifications (signalled by a crack of the judge's stockwhip) occur when a competitor loses his beast more than twice on the camp; losing control of the beast in the arena or running a beast onto the arena fence. A \\"tail turn\\" executed by a horse in the opposite direction of the beast's line of travel also incurs disqualification at any stage of the draft.Campdraft Rules The sport requires consummate skill and horsemanship, and the skill in selecting a beast from the mob that will run well, but is not too fast for that particular horse. Great prestige is bestowed on the winning horse and rider of the competition. History It is thought the sport developed in outback Queensland among the stockmen and drovers in informal competitions to prove horse skills. The first formal campdrafting competition occurred in Tenterfield at the Tenterfield Show Society's 1885 show.Tenterfield & District, Tenterfield & District Visitors Assoc., n.d. Competing at this event was Clarence Smith, a cattleman and horse breeder near Tenterfield, on the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales. He went on to create the rules and judging procedures that remain similar to the rules of today. The Warwick Gold Cup is one of the premier events on Australia's campdraft calendar where around 1,800 camp drafters compete for prize money over about four days of competition. Paradise Lagoons in Queensland is the venue of the richest campdraft in Australia with A$230,000 of prize money distributed over the four days of competition. The Acton Super Beef Open Campdraft has prize money of $80,000. This event, alone attracted 605 entries, which was conducted with two rounds and a final.Australian Horseman magazine, July‚ÄìAugust 2009, Paradise Lagoons, p.21-23, C&D; Publishing, Goondiwindi The Queensland Triple Crown of campdrafting consists of the Condamine Bell, Chinchilla Grandfather Clock and Warwick Gold Cup campdrafts.Australian Stock Horse magazine, Jan/Feb 2010, Australian Stock Horse Society, Scone, NSW Walcha, New South Wales has held the National titles on several occasions as the district is one of the few able to supply the quantities of quality cattle needed for these big events. Most campdrafting days schedule an open, maiden, novice, ladies' and junior events. Larger competition days may also include a draft for stallions and even bareback riders.Australian Campdrafting Magazine, October‚ÄìNovember 2008,\\"Halls Creek Campdraft\\" p. 20, Energi Print, NSW Campdrafting has become a very popular family sport, with the husband, wife and a child sometimes competing on one horse in the ladies' campdraft, junior 'draft and then in another drafting event with the man up. There are 30,000 campdrafters (horses) currently (2008) registered and competing at various locations in Australia.Northern Daily Leader, Landmark Classic Campdraft Sale, 24 May 2008 The Equine influenza outbreak in Australia during 2007 and 2008 saw many horse events cancelled including campdrafting. During this time some shows ran small campdraft events using motorcycles instead of horses. Motorcycle campdrafting, during the Equine Influenza outbreak The Acton family has constructed a $3,000,000 purpose designed and constructed campdrafting complex situated on their property, Paradise Lagoons near Rockhampton, Queensland. In July 2008, $230,000 (A$) in prize money was available to successful competitors who competed here. During 2008, $500,000 was spent upgrading spectator facilities in preparation for the event. The annual Paradise Lagoons campdrafting events now have three non-stop arenas that operate for four days for increased prizemoney. In February 2009 the richest campdraft, the $50,000 Landmark Classic Campdraft was held at the Australian Equine and Livestock Events Centre, Tamworth. Following this a new Australian record was established for a non-Thoroughbred horse sale when the annual Landmark Classic Campdraft Horse Sale was held here. The 320 horses sold here for $2.9 million to a top of $46,000 and an average of $9,075.The Land, \\"Tamworth's $2.9m sale defies the odds\\", Amy Lawson, p.7, Rural Press, 19-2-2009 'Open campdrafting' is still practised on cattle properties when selected beasts are drafted from the mob while they are in their paddock, instead of droving the cattle for yard drafting. The National Campdraft Council of Australia was formed around 2000 and oversees the four campdrafting bodies which are the Australian Bushmen's Campdraft and Rodeo Association (based in Tamworth), the Australian Campdraft Association (in Queensland), the Southern Campdrafters Association and Gippsland Campdraft Association (GCA). Campdrafting is recognised by the Australian Institute of Sport as a national sport.The Northern Daily Leader, 6 February 2010, A landmark for a growing sport, p. 38, Rural Press, Tamworth, NSW The horse The ideal horse for this work is considered to be about 15 hands and agile enough to take a beast from the camp without trouble. He then needs the speed to control the beast and the body weight to push a big bullock round by pressure on his shoulder, if needed. Beyond this, he has to be willing, and have the cattle sense necessary in this most exacting, and often dangerous trial of strength between man, horse, and beast. A bigger horse is typically not suited to the sharp turns in this sport. A polo or polocrosse horses' work requirements are somewhat similar. A good campdrafting horse does not take his eye off the beast and the rider has to watch his own seat when the horse is propping and turning on the job. If the steer will not be readily persuaded into making any particular turn, he may then be \\"shouldered\\" into position by the horse pushing him in the right direction.Martin, Desmond, Australia Astride, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1959 The most popular breed of horse for campdrafting is the Australian Stock Horse. These horses developed from bloodlines of various breeds, some tracing back to stock that arrived with the earliest Australian colonists. Formal recognition of Australian Stock Horses as a distinct breed began in June 1971 when over one hundred campdrafters and horse breeders met to form the Australian Stock Horse Society. The first sale of campdraft focused horses was held at the Landmark Classic Campdraft Sale, Tamworth on 24 May 2008.

They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns.  Construction and Career  Alagi was built in the CRDA shipyard, in Monfalcone. She was laid down on 19 March 1936, launched 15 November of the same year, and commissioned on 6 March 1937. On May 11, 1937 Alagi was assigned to the 23rd Squadron based in Naples, from where she conducted training in the Dodecanese. During the Spanish Civil War, between 27 August and 4 September 1937, she carried out a special mission. In 1939 she was reassigned for some time to the base in Cagliari and then to Messina.Alagi at Monfalcone Naval Museum In 1940 Alagi was assigned to 71st Squadron (V Submarine Group) based at Cagliari. On 10 June 1940, at the outbreak of hostilities, Alagi was on patrol in the waters off Bizerta. She remained on station until June 20 without sighting any enemy ships. From June 5 to 11 of 1941, Alagi, under command of captain Giulio Contreas, patrolled 20 miles northeast of Ras Azzaz. She sighted a small enemy ship and tried to launch an attack, but it was interrupted by a second ship which detected Alagi and headed in her direction, forcing her to disengage. At 10:47 on June 12, 1941 while returning to Messina, Alagi was attacked with two bombs and machine guns off Benghazi by a British Sunderland aircraft. The boat's crew responded with anti-aircraft weapons forcing the plane to turn away, probably because it was hit. On July 18, 1941 she patrolled off of Cap Bougaro√ªn. On July 22 she detected Force H but was unable to attack it, and was subject to anti- submarine search by escorts. During August 1941 Alagi patrolled between Sardinia and La Galite Island. She spent November and December 1941 patrolling off Cape Fer. In the late afternoon of January 14, 1942 in the Strait of Sicily, Alagi sighted a British naval formation and at 21:05 launched two torpedoes, which did not hit any targets. On 8 June 1942, roughly 20 nm North of Cape Bon Alagi, under command of captain Sergio Puccini, fired three torpedoes at a naval column (later identified as friendly convoy from Naples to Tripoli). One torpedo hit and sunk the Italian destroyer Antoniotto Usodimare in a friendly fire incident (141 killed and 165 survivors). On July 12, 1942 at 20:04 in the position , northwest of Tripoli, Syria, Alagi fired two torpedoes and scored one hit in the engine room of the Turkish tanker Antares (3723 GRT, 1893) on a trip from Iskanderun to Haifa, causing her to be beached on Ruad Island. The tanker was later re-floated, towed to Turkey and scrapped in late 1943. In August 1942 Alagi operated along the Regia Marina and Luftwaffe to intercept and block an Allied convoy to Malta (Operation Pedestal). On August 12, 1942 at 21:05 in the position Alagi fired a spread of 4 torpedoes against a merchant and a cruiser, and immediately dove. 3 explosions were heard. At 21:12 cruiser was hit forward by one of four torpedoes and sustained damage to bow structure. was able to make 25 knots and remained with the convoy to continue operating in defense of merchants. The other 2 torpedoes hit and sunk M/V Clan Ferguson which was previously damaged by a bomb from Ju 88. On November 8, 1942 while sailing submerged to her area of operation near Bizerta she collided underwater with another Italian submarine and suffered serious damage to her tower and had to turn back and return to Naples. In December she first patrolled between Cape Bougaroun, island of La Galite and Cape Fer and then from December 29 near Bona. In January 1943 Alagi patrolled northeast of Bona. From February through June 1943 she conducted several patrols south and southwest of Sardinia. In July 1943 Alagi first patrolled south of Sardinia, and later provided defensive screen in the waters of Sicily. On July 16, at 6:13 in the position she intercepted a column of three destroyers. Alagi launched three torpedoes while on surface. After a minute and 45 seconds a violent explosion was heard, but no information about this action was ever reported in British official documentation. On September 3, 1943 Alagi was deployed to the Gulf of Salerno, and on September 7, under the Zeta Plan, she was sent along with ten other submarines to the Tyrrhenian Sea, between the Gulf of Gaeta and the Gulf of Paola to intercept an anticipated Anglo-American landing in southern Italy. On September 9, 1943 following the announcement of the Armistice, Alagi which at that time was about sixty miles from Augusta headed for Malta, where she arrived on September 16, 1943 along with five other submarines escorted by destroyer . Upon arrival she surrender to the Allies. On October 13, 1943 Alagi together with fifteen other submarines left Malta for mainland Italy. In October 1943, Alagi was transferred to Haifa where she was employed as a training unit for British troops and as a shipping vessel for supplies to the Aegean Islands. She returned to Taranto in December 1944, where she remained inactive until the end of the war. She was sold for scrap on 1 February 1948.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 26, 2000. In the episode, Mr. Burns hires a cash-strapped Homer as his \\"prank monkey\\", paying him to play pranks on others and humiliate himself in public. The episode was written by Rob LaZebnik in his last writing credit for over eight years, until season 20's \\"Father Knows Worst\\". The episode features cultural references to The Magic Christian and The Birds. The episode has been met with negative reviews. Plot The family take Bart to dinner at the Singing Sirloin restaurant (as seen in \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\") for getting his first \\"A\\" on an astronomy quiz. When asked how he achieved this rarity, Bart explains that he was in Mrs. Krabappel's class trying to force a hamster and a lizard to mate, but was forced to hide in the coat closet when he saw Krabappel and Principal Skinner making out, and needing to get his mind off this, he studied a chart of the Solar System on the closet wall. The family's feeling of pride does not last, though, as a waiter tells Homer that the credit card he has attempted to use for paying the meal has been rejected. The family responds by trying to run away, but are stopped and made to sing and entertain the other customers in the restaurant to work off their debt. At the end of the night, as the family is driving home, Bart and Lisa notice that the back seats and floor of the car are missing, and Homer explains that he had to sell them for gas money (which he spent on a novelty car horn). He and Marge subsequently learn from a visit to financial planner Lindsay Naegle that the Simpsons are having severe money woes. In the hope of sorting out these problems, Homer decides to ask his boss, Mr. Burns, for a raise. Burns, meanwhile, has decided to spend a week looking for things to amuse himself while his assistant, Smithers, is in New Mexico performing in a Malibu Stacy musical that he wrote. When Burns tries unsuccessfully to use the salad bar at the cafeteria, Homer shows him how, then sums up his courage to ask for a raise. Burns is unimpressed and, wanting a \\"larf\\", orders Homer to throw a pudding at Lenny with the promise of four dollars. Homer does so, amusing Burns so much that he decides to make Homer his \\"Executive in Charge of Recreation\\" or, in his words, his \\"prank monkey\\". Subsequently, Burns takes Homer around the streets of Springfield, making him perform embarrassing or cruel tasks, such as eating an original copy of The Amazing Spider-Man #1 in front of Comic Book Guy and pretending to be a baby in a public toilet, and paying him for each of these tasks. Then, Burns takes him to the Springfield Zoo, where he makes him put on a panda suit and masquerade as a new female panda named \\"Sim-Sim\\" in the hope of shocking onlookers when they discover the disguise. It goes wrong for Homer, though, when first he is zapped by two animal handlers, before the zoo's male panda, Ping-Ping, becomes romantically interested in \\"Sim-Sim\\" and drags \\"her\\" into his cave, where it is implied Homer is raped by the panda. Finally, when Homer tries to escape after the rendezvous, he ends up in the skunk exhibit and gets sprayed. It is then that Lisa discovers him. Lisa convinces Homer to stop being a \\"prank monkey\\" as his dignity is more important than money. This he does, though Burns still gives him his payment for the panda task. When Homer asks Lisa what he should do with all the money he has earned, Lisa suggests donating it to needy children, so he spends it all on toys at Costington's Department Store. Mr. Costington is so impressed by this show of generosity that he suggests that Homer dress up as Santa Claus for the upcoming Thanksgiving Day parade, distributing the toys to the kids. During the parade, however, Burns shows up and tries to convince Homer, in his Santa costume, to pull a prank on the whole town. Homer flatly refuses, only to be tempted by Burns' promise of one million dollars. Santa is then seen throwing bucketfuls of fish guts into the crowd, which results in an attack by seagulls. A disappointed Lisa watches on, remarking, \\"Oh, dad, you sold your soul,\\" when Homer, back in his normal clothes, appears alongside her; it turns out that Burns is now wearing the Santa costume. Homer thanks Lisa for giving him \\"the gift of dignity\\", and the family embrace before Burns throws fish guts at them. Production Leeza Gibbons guest starred as herself. The episode was written by Rob LaZebnik and directed by Neil Affleck, the last episode that he directed. It is LaZebnik's first full written script with the first script being \\"G-G-Ghost D-D-Dad\\" from \\"Treehouse of Horror XI\\" and is based on The Magic Christian. There was originally a sub- plot with Smithers' musical. LaZebnik brought some friends and his wife to the table read and during the third act was repeatedly ended and went badly making Larry Doyle laugh hysterically. There was another prank where Mr. Burns put a lottery ticket into a grave and everybody went digging for the lottery ticket. The episode includes a character named Rusty the Clown, a reference to Rusty Nails, the inspiration for Krusty the Clown. There was originally going to be a running gag where Lenny keeps getting hit with random objects. There were many endings to the original script. One ending was Homer throwing pig's blood into the crowd and 50 years later showing Homer telling a group of children that this was the reason why Thanksgiving was renamed Bloodsfest. They were also going to be hit by blood and laugh. There was also another ending with gravy, but then changed to fish guts. The full version of the song \\"Sold Separately\\" was later released on The Simpsons soundtrack album, The Simpsons: Testify. \\"Homer vs. Dignity\\" was included on The Simpsons Christmas 2 DVD along with \\"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\\", \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\", and \\"'Tis the 15th Season\\".https://www.amazon.com/Simpsons-Christmas-2-Dan- Castellaneta/dp/B0002PYS60/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1273535014&sr;=8-1 Reception The episode has received negative reviews from critics. Cindy White of IGN said that while the episode is universally panned (mostly due to the scene where Homer is (implicitly) raped by a panda at the zoo and the intentional recycling of other Simpsons episode premises, such as The Simpsons having financial trouble, Mr. Burns hiring Homer to be his assistant while Smithers is on vacation, Someone dressing up as a baby, Homer dressing up as Santa Claus, and Lisa worrying over someone selling his soul), it has funny throwaway jokes and sight gags to make up for it. In September 2009, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a negative review, saying \\"Bad sign number one: when a series plagiarizes itself. That occurs here when Mr. Burns states 'There‚Äôs a new Mexico?', a line that was a lot funnier...back in season five. Bad sign number two: a scene in which Homer gets raped by a panda. A couple of the pranks provide minor amusement, but overall, this is a weak episode.\\" Judge Mac McEntire of the DVD Verdict said the episode's best moment was with Homer and the panda. Mike Scully claims that the episode was critically panned because not many people had seen The Magic Christian.  Cultural references  *The chalkboard gag reads \\"I am not the Sixth Beatle\\", a reference to the \\"Fifth Beatle\\". *The episode's plot is similar to the film The Magic Christian: **The main character, Sir Guy Grand, is an eccentric billionaire who bribes people to carry out his whims, similar to Mr. Burns' hiring Homer to be his \\"prank monkey\\". **Grand also plays his pranks to shock people, mocking what they consider to be important, similar to the prank that Burns and Homer play on Comic Book Guy. *In celebration of Bart's \\"A\\" on an astronomy quiz, the waitstaff at The Singing Sirloin sing \\"Happy First A\\", a parody of \\"Happy Birthday\\". *When the Simpsons are pressed into service as a Mariachi band to pay for their meal at The Singing Sirloin, they are heard playing: **\\"La Bamba\\": Best known for its covers by Ritchie Valens in 1958 and Los Lobos in 1987. **\\"Spanish Eyes\\": Originally an instrumental titled \\"Moon Over Naples\\", it was re-titled to \\"Spanish Eyes\\" when lyrics were added. *Singing Sirloin employee Mary Kay seems to be a reference to the Mary Kay company, judging by her pink makeup and all-pink outfit. *When Smithers asks Mr. Burns for time off to produce his Malibu Stacy musical, Burns laughs and sarcastically asks, \\"Why not write a musical about the common cat? Or the King of Siam?\\", referencing the musicals Cats and The King and I, respectively. *Just before Homer and Mr. Burns prank him, Comic Book Guy is eating pink marshmallow Peeps. *Star Trek: Voyager: When Homer says he'd like to buy a mint condition Spider-Man #1 comic, Comic Book Guy sarcastically replies that he'd like an hour on the holodeck with Seven of Nine. *During the Panda- Monium!, Mr. Burns has Homer (costumed as female panda) dance the Lindy Hop, a dance which was very popular during the late 1930s and early 1940s. *One of the Thanksgiving parade balloons is of Rusty the Clown, a reference to Rusty Nails: **Rusty Nails was a popular TV clown in the 1960s in Portland, Oregon, where Simpsons creator Matt Groening grew up. **Krusty the Clown is loosely based on Rusty Nails. *Other balloons seen in the parade include: **A balloon that closely resembles El Chapul√≠n Colorado, the main character of the TV series of the same name, on whom Bumblebee Man is based. **Funky Winkerbean, the title character from the comic strip. **The Noid, who was an advertising mascot for Domino's Pizza in the 1980s. *The figure on the parade float \\"saluting the Native Americans\\" bears a strong resemblance to Chief Wahoo, the Cleveland Indians' logo. *When the gulls attack the townspeople (who are covered in the fish guts Burns has thrown on them), it is similar to a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.

The degree of his involvement in the events leading up to the outbreak of World War I is a matter of keen debate, with some historians putting the blame for an early and provocative mobilization squarely on Sazonov's shoulders, and others maintaining that his chief preoccupation was \\"to reduce the temperature of international relations, especially in the Balkans\\".John M. Bourne. Who's Who in World War One. Routledge, 2001. . Page 259.  Early career  Of lesser noble background, Sazonov was the brother-in-law of Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who did his best to further Sazonov's career. Having graduated from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, Sazonov served in the London embassy, and the diplomatic mission to the Vatican, of which he became the chief in March 1906. On 26 June 1909 Sazonov was recalled to St. Petersburg and appointed Assistant Foreign Minister. Before long he replaced Alexander Izvolsky as Foreign Minister and followed a policy along the lines laid down by Stolypin.  Foreign Minister  = Potsdam Agreement = Just before he was officially appointed foreign minister, Sazonov attended a meeting between Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany in Potsdam on 4‚Äì6 November 1910. This move was intended to chastise the British for their perceived betrayal of Russia's interests during the Bosnian crisis. Indeed, Britain's Foreign Secretary was seriously alarmed by this token of a \\"German-Russian D√©tente\\".Siegel, Jennifer. Endgame: Britain, Russia and the Final Struggle for Central Asia. I.B. Tauris, 2002. . Pages 90-92. The two monarchs discussed the ambitious German project of the Baghdad Railway, widely expected to give Berlin considerable geopolitical clout in the Fertile Crescent. Against the background of the Persian Constitutional Revolution, Russia was anxious to control the prospective Khanaqin-Tehran branch of the railway. The two powers settled their differences in the Potsdam Agreement, signed on 19 August 1911 and giving Russia a free hand in Northern Iran. Sazonov was sick during that time, his office was led by Anatoly Neratov during his absence. However, as Sazonov hoped, the first railway connecting Persia to Europe would provide Russia with a lever of influence over its southern neighbour. Notwithstanding the promising beginning, the Russian-German relations disintegrated in 1913, when the Kaiser sent one of his generals to reorganize the Turkish army and to supervise the garrison in Constantinople on request of the Ottomans, remarking that \\"the German flag will soon fly over the fortifications of the Bosphorus\\", a vital trade artery which accounted for two fifths of Russia's exports.Lowe, John. The Great Powers, Imperialism, and the German Problem, 1865-1925. Routledge, 1994. . page 210. = Alliance with Japan = Despite his fixation on Russian-German affairs, Sazonov was also mindful of Russian interests in the Far East. In the wake of the disastrous Russo-Japanese War, he steadily made friendly overtures toward Japan. As a result, a secret convention was signed in St. Petersburg on 8 July 1912 concerning the delimitation of spheres of interest in Inner Mongolia. Both powers determined to keep Inner Mongolia politically separate from Outer Mongolia. Four years later, Sazonov congratulated himself on concluding a Russian-Japanese defensive alliance (3 July 1916) aimed at securing the interests of both powers in China. = World War I = Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov In the run-up to a major military conflict in Europe, another concern of the Russian minister was to isolate Austria-Hungary, mainly by playing the Balkan card against the dwindling power of the Habsburgs. Since Sazonov was moderate in his Balkan politics, his ministry \\"came under frequent nationalist fire for failing to conform to a rigid pan-Slav line\\".Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. Routledge, 1996. . Page 122. While the extremist agents like Nicholas Hartwig aspired to solidify the conflicting South Slavic states into a confederacy under the aegis of the Tsar, there is no indication that Sazonov personally shared or encouraged these views. Regardless, both Austria and Germany were persuaded that Russia fomented Pan- Slavism in Belgrade and other Slavic capitals, a belligerent attitude in some measure responsible for the Assassination in Sarajevo and the outbreak of the Great War. Serbia was a client state of Russia. That caused Russia to defend Serbia against Austria after the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Sazonov warned Austria in 1914 that Russia, \\"would respond militarily to any action against the client state.\\" Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2012) p 481. As World War I unwound, Sazonov worked to prevent Romania from joining the Central Powers and wrested in March 1915 an acquiescence from Russia's allies to the post-war occupation of the Bosphorus, Constantinople, and the European side of the Dardanelles. On 1 October 1914 Sazonov gave a written guarantee to Romania that, if the country sided with the Entente, it would be enlarged at the expense of the Austrian dominions in Transylvania, Bukovina, and the Banat. In general, \\"his calm and courteous manner did much to maintain fruitful Allied relations\\". He accepted an announcement of the professor Thomas Garrigue Masaryk PRECL√çK, Vratislav.

Later life  The grave of Sergey Sazonov Early in 1917, Sazonov was appointed ambassador in Great Britain, but found it necessary to remain in Russia, where he witnessed the February Revolution. He was opposed to Bolshevism, advised Anton Denikin on international affairs, and was foreign minister in the anti-Bolshevik government of Admiral Kolchak. In 1919 he represented the Provisional All- Russian Government, the Allied recognized government of Russia, at the Paris Peace Conference. Sazonov spent his last years in France writing a book of memoirs. He died in Nice where he is buried.

Bad Taste should not be confused with Bad Taste Records, a distinct record label based in Sweden. History After the bankruptcy of Gramm Records, and the demise of Kukl, Einar √ñrn Benediktsson, one of the vocalists of Kukl and √Åsmundur J√≥nsson from Gramm, with some of the former musicians from Kukl and members of surrealistic group called Med√∫sa, convened to create a record company called Smekkleysa in 1986. Later, it was renamed to its English translation, Bad Taste, after Pablo Picasso‚Äôs manifesto: ‚ÄúGood taste and frugality are the enemies of creativity‚Äù. Smekkleysa‚Äôs first work was a postcard drawn by Fri√∞rik Erlingsson, who at that time was the guitar player of Sykurmolarnir (Icelandic for The Sugarcubes), a band led by Einar √ñrn and Bj√∂rk. This piece of art contained the faces of Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan, a map of Iceland and the flags of the USSR and the United States as background, due to the Reykjav√≠k Peace Summit that was to take place by October, 1986. Around 5,000 copies of this image were sold and the funds were used by the group to release their first record, a 7‚Äù vinyl single by Sykurmolarnir titled Einn Mol'√° Mann (‚ÄúOne Cube per Person‚Äù) which contained the Icelandic versions of \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Cat\\", two songs that would appear later on their first album, Life's Too Good in 1987 through Elektra Records; an album that served to boost the international acclaim of The Sugarcubes. However, Einn Mol'√° Mann did not sell as expected, because alternative music had always had difficulty reaching the public and most of the bands from the underground scene used to sell their works at caf√©s. Until 2000, this single was still available from the Ordering Department created in 1992. When The Sugarcubes achieved an agreement with One Little Indian Records, a new record company created by Derek Birkett, their incomes increased with the release of Birthday, the first single published in England, which was chosen as single of the week by Melody Maker. All the money earned by The Sugarcubes was primarily used for more projects and to support new bands to escort The Sugarcubes when touring. But by the end of the eighties, it was clear that the end of The Sugarcubes was coming, and Bj√∂rk released a jazz record in 1990 titled Gling-Gl√≥ in a short-lived group called Bj√∂rk Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir & Tr√≠√≥ Gu√∞mundar Ing√≥lfssonar. The growth of Bad Taste slowed after The Sugarcubes broke up in 1992, and even though it had a subsequent contract with Sigur R√≥s, the band moved to an English label (although Bad Taste still handles their Icelandic market). This was because Bad Taste‚Äôs contracts allowed artists‚Äô freedom to choose to record their next work in another label. Today, things are different and Bad Taste has first rights to the next album of any artist they produce, although they give full artistic freedom. Other Bad Taste projects were to include a radio station called Skratti (‚ÄúDevil‚Äù), a restaurant called Drullupytturinn (‚ÄúThe Mud Pit‚Äù), but neither of these became reality. A record store named after the company exists in midtown Reykjav√≠k, and the Smekkleysa mail order service has been running for over 15 years. The mail order handles all available Smekkleysa titles, plus selected Icelandic music released by other labels.

At the time of its establishment a majority of new radio stations received call signs from a sequential list maintained by the regulators at the Department of Commerce, but station owners were also permitted to make special requests, and a contemporary report commenting on WOWO's distinctive call letters suggested \\"The trick call letters, it is believed, will add to the novelty of the plant.\\">\\"Six New Stations Join Broadcaters\\", Washington (D.C.) Evening Star, June 27, 1925, page 9. By choosing WOWO for easy pronunciation as a two- syllable word, in the station had a call sign that exhibited more brevity than even three-letter versions. Despite this, disk jockeys on WOWO were originally prohibited from calling the station \\"Wo-Wo\\" on the air until the late 1960s, when a contest was introduced to identify songs in which the \\"woe\\" sound appeared. The WOWO call sign was later back-filled as a tongue-in-cheek acronym: \\"Wayne (as in Fort Wayne) Offers Wonderful Opportunities\\". In 1927, WOWO was made a pioneer station joining the CBS Radio Network and remained a CBS network affiliate until 1956. In 1928, Keen sold WOWO to Fred Zieg, who also owned WGL. In 1929, Zieg received government approval to move WOWO to 1190 kHz with a power of 10,000 watts and to move WGL over to WOWO's former 1320 kHz. Until WOWO's purchase by Westinghouse in 1936, Zieg managed the advertising sales of both WOWO and WGL through WOWO-WGL Sales Service, Inc. On July 4, 1929, the building housing WOWO and WGL caught fire. No casualties were reported, and operations were moved to a nearby location; amazingly enough, the station's large pipe organ, a familiar sound on the station, was not damaged in the blaze. Operations were resumed the following day, and the WOWO pipe organ was later relocated to Gospel Temple in Fort Wayne. In 1930, WOWO was the first radio station in the world to broadcast a live basketball game. It is also considered to be the first station to broadcast live Indiana high school sports events. In the 1930s, WOWO launched the music program, Hoosier Hop, which by 1932 was popular enough to be airing nationally on CBS. It continued to air into the 1940s. Among the regular performers on Hoosier Hop in 1946 were the country-western group The Down Homers, which at the time included future rock and roll pioneer Bill Haley as a member.Bill Haley interview with Red Robinson, 1967, released on LP as Bill Haley & The Comets with Interview By Red Robinson (Great Northwest Music Company GNW 4015, 1981) and on CD as The Bill Haley Tapes (Jerden JRCD 7023, 1995). =Westinghouse purchase= In August 1936, WOWO was acquired by Westinghouse Broadcasting as its first purchase of a radio station it did not put on the air. WOWO joined original Westinghouse outlets KDKA in Pittsburgh, KYW in Philadelphia, WBZ in Boston and WBZA in Springfield, Massachusetts. Westinghouse built new studios for WOWO at 925 South Harrison Street in Fort Wayne, which were completed on May 1, 1937. On that same date WOWO joined the NBC Blue Network, while maintaining its CBS network affiliation, as multiple network affiliations were common for Blue affiliates. On March 29, 1941, Westinghouse completed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensing of WOWO's famous clear- channel signal on AM 1190, making it a Class I-B station, operating around the clock at 50,000 watts. During and after World War II, these clear-channel broadcasts made WOWO a popular radio superstation of sorts throughout the Eastern United States. Although there were other radio stations broadcasting on 1190 kHz during daylight hours, they were required by the FCC either to cease broadcasting at sunset or to reduce their power at night to make way for WOWO's clear-channel signal. For instance, WLIB went on the air in New York in 1942 at AM 1190. It was required to sign-off at sunset time in Fort Wayne, so it would not interfere with WOWO's broadcasts. On April 30, 1952, WOWO's studio and offices were relocated to the upper floors of 128 West Washington Boulevard.Broadcasting Yearbook 1954 page 136 It was here that the station began its famous \\"fire-escape\\" weather forecasts, involving obtaining weather conditions from the fire escape ledge. In 1977, WOWO's studios moved to the fourth floor of the Central Building at 203 West Wayne Street in Fort Wayne, where it would remain for the next fifteen years. When the station relocated to the Central Building, the old fire escape was cut into small pieces, encapsulated in Lucite and distributed as a promotional paper weight. Programming for the station changed several times. As network programming shifted from radio to television in the 1950s, WOWO's network affiliations were discontinued in 1956. The station switched to playing popular music, along with news, sports and talk. In the 1960s and 70s, WOWO was a popular Top 40 music station, not just in the Fort Wayne area, but after sunset, around the Midwest and Eastern U.S. =Agricultural broadcasts= With Fort Wayne being roughly equidistant from Chicago, Detroit and Cincinnati, clear-channel WOWO competed with WLS, WJR and WLW for the agricultural market. Farmers would have the radio turned on in the milking parlor. WOWO executives claimed it relaxed the cows and produced more milk. In an era when live music was featured on radio stations, WOWO's own \\"Nancy Lee and the Hilltoppers\\" proved popular with rural audiences, and eventually WLS, WJR and WLW surrendered the rural audience to concentrate on their urban audiences, leaving WOWO unchallenged for the rural market. Some Midwesterners who had listened to WOWO in their youth continued to pick the station up when they retired to Florida and other warm-weather states in the east. Nancy Lee and the Hilltoppers' \\"Little Red Barn\\" was used as a theme song for Bob Sievers' daily show. When recorded music became the norm for the station, WOWO featured a live show on Saturdays called \\"Little Red Barn\\" with Nancy Lee and the Hilltoppers. Nancy Lee was the wife of Sam DeVincent, music librarian for the station. =Westinghouse sells WOWO= In 1982, Westinghouse sold WOWO to the Wayne Broadcasting Corporation.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page B-87 Despite the sale, WOWO still uses the distinctive Group W typeface for the call letters in its white on PF-152 red logo. In 1994, the station was bought by Inner City Broadcasting, based in New York.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1995 page B-136 Inner City paid $2.3 million for WOWO and its sister station in Huntington, 102.9 WOWO-FM (now WJCI). In 1997, Inner City sold WOWO to its current owner, Federated Media.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1998 page D-149 In the 1980s, music listening shifted to FM and WOWO saw its ratings as a Top 40 station fall. At 7:30 a.m. on December 16, 1988, WOWO switched to a 1950s-thru-70s oldies format. In 1992 the format changed to full service adult contemporary, and then in 1996, the station switched to a news-talk format which remains to this day. =WOWO as a clear-channel station= From 1941 to 1995 WOWO was well-known, in both Indiana and areas to the east, as a clear-channel AM station. WOWO broadcast with 50,000 watts of power both during daylight and nighttime hours. From sunset to sunrise, WOWO's three tower in-line directional antenna was configured to protect the other Class I-B stations in the U.S., KEX in Portland, Oregon. The nighttime broadcasts were branded as WOWO's Nighttime Skywave Service, the \\"Voice of a Thousand Main Streets.\\" During the 1970s, the station's hourly legal identification (required by the FCC) stated: \\"50,000 watts on 1190, WOWO, Fort Wayne, Group W, Westinghouse Broadcasting.\\" Jay Gould spoke to many community organizations, relating the history of WOWO. Initially, the leading station in Detroit (WJR), Chicago (WLS), and Cincinnati (WLW) all competed for farmer listeners with agricultural reports. WOWO, almost equidistant between those three stations eventually captured that demographic, with the other three stations focusing on their urban and suburban areas. This benefited WOWO as national advertisers saw WOWO as a regional station that would reach well into the backyards of those larger metropolises. WOWO's clear-channel license permitted WOWO's radio personalities to gain some degree of fame throughout the eastern United States and Canada. They included Bob Sievers, the station's farm director, commentator, folk-philosopher and morning man. Sievers, who was on the station for over 50 years (until 1987) was a major Fort Wayne celebrity and was inducted into National Radio Hall of Fame in 2017. Also heard was Jay Gould, News Director Dugan Fry, meteorologist Earl Finckle, the \\"In a Little Red Barn (on a farm down in Indiana)\\" de facto theme song of WOWO, the Penny Pitch charity fund raisers, sports director Bob Chase's Komet Hockey broadcasts, the weather reports from WOWO's personnel on its studio's \\"world-famous fire escape,\\" and husband-wife hosts of The Little Red Barn Show, music director Sam DeVincent and wife Nancy of \\"Nancy Lee and the Hilltoppers\\", all were listened to by people from the Great Lakes to the United States' East Coast and Eastern Canada. Other memorable on-air personalities include Ron Gregory, Chris Roberts, Jack Underwood and Carol Ford. WOWO's nighttime skywave service required WLIB in New York City, which also broadcasts at 1190 kHz, to operate during daylight hours only with 10,000 watts of power permitted by FCC. But if WLIB could operate at night, it would become much more valuable to its owner, Inner City Broadcasting. So in 1994, Inner City bought WOWO, even though nearly all its other holdings were radio stations serving African American listeners. Inner City's intention was to reduce WOWO from a Class A to a Class B, giving up its clear-channel status, reducing power to 9,800 watts after sunset. This move permitted WLIB to broadcast around the clock, no longer needing to sign off to protect WOWO's nighttime clear-channel signal. This reduced WOWO's potential audience to a much smaller local region in northern Indiana, northwestern Ohio, and south-central Michigan. Before the power reduction, when WLIB signed off at night, WOWO could often be heard on the speakers in WLIB's studios. =1971 Emergency Broadcast System false alarm= On February 20, 1971, NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado was ready to broadcast a required weekly test of the Emergency Broadcast System. However, AT&T; reported that the United States Air Force accidentally used the wrong tape for the test, and initiated an Emergency Action Notification, normally issued by the Office of Civil Defense or the President. This prompted all stations in the Fort Wayne, Indiana, area by order of the FCC to operate under emergency procedures and feed the broadcast from WOWO through their radios. Bob Sievers was at the microphone at WOWO at the time; Sievers and everyone at the studio had no idea what was going on.Emergency Broadcast System - False Alarm of 1971 HistoryOfWOWO.com The WOWO recording is used in the song \\"Cold Call\\" by American progressive rock band OSI on their release Fire Make Thunder. The song that played before the EBS was \\"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\\" by The Partridge Family, and the song played during and after the EBS was \\"The Theme From Love Story\\" by Henry Mancini. =WOWO today= WOWO is currently located at the Federated Media broadcast complex on Maples Road on Fort Wayne's south side; the facility also serves as the transmitter site for co-owned WKJG. WOWO was the first Fort Wayne station to transmit in AM stereo. It later became the first Fort Wayne AM station to transmit with HD Radio technology. The station streams its programs over the Internet. On weekdays, \\"Fort Wayne's Morning News,\\" was hosted by long time market veteran Charly Butcher until his sudden death in August 2018. Pat Miller, who had broadcast on Saturday mornings starting in April 2001, moved his program to the weekday afternoon drive time spot in May 2010. Most of the standard Premiere Radio Networks syndicated schedule makes up the remainder of the broadcast day: Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Buck Sexton, Clyde Lewis and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Weekend programming includes Kim Kommando, Dana Loesch, Bill Cunningham and Todd Starnes. Fox News Radio supplies world and national news updates. WOWO partners with WPTA-TV for local weather and news. WOWO broadcasts the Fort Wayne Komets ECHL hockey games and is the Fort Wayne home of the Indianapolis Colts football team. Bob Chase announced his retirement as Sports Director of WOWO after 56 years behind the mic, effective June 5, 2009. Chase was the voice of the Fort Wayne Komets until his death in November 2016 at the age of 90. In September 2014, WOWO was won a Marconi Award as the Medium Market Station of the Year by the National Association of Broadcasters.National Association of Broadcasters, http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/RadioShow2014/Marconi/091114_Marconi_MediumMarket_Station.htm =FM simulcasts= Several FM stations over the years carried the WOWO-FM call letters. From 1940 to 1943, WOWO experimented with FM broadcasts as W49FW. WOWO-FM operated from 1943‚Äì1953 on 96.1 MHz. From 1988‚Äì1994, WOWO-FM in Huntington (now WJCI) broadcast at first on 103.1, then shifted to 102.9. The two stations aired an oldies music format. On March 28, 2012 at noon, WOWO's news/talk format began to simulcast on 92.3 FM, with that station taking the WOWO-FM call letters. The station was previously classic rock WFWI. The WOWO simulcast moved to newly launched translator station 107.5 W298BJ Fort Wayne, on December 14, 2015. 92.3 stopped simulcasting WOWO on January 1, 2016 and switched to a classic hits format, returning to the WFWI call sign.

He is a former aide to President Bill Clinton; a long-time confidant of Hillary Clinton, formerly employed by the Clinton Foundation; and a journalist, particularly known for his writings about American politics and foreign policy. Blumenthal is also the author of a multivolume biography of Abraham Lincoln, The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln. Three books of the planned five-volume series have already been published: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel, and All the Powers of Earth. Subsequent volumes are planned for 2020 and later. Blumenthal has written for numerous publications, including The Washington Post, Vanity Fair, and The New Yorker, for whom he served for a time as the magazine's Washington correspondent, and, was, briefly, the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for Salon, for which he has written over 1,800 pieces online. He is a regular contributor to the openDemocracy website and was formerly a regular columnist for The Guardian. After 2000, he published several essays critical of the administration of George W. Bush.What Bush is hiding, Salon; March 22, 2007. Retrieved May 21, 2015. Over time, Blumenthal became increasingly controversial for his partisan brand of journalism, viewed as an archetype of a new type of journalist who have eroded the divide between the fading boundaries between independent journalism and partisan journalism: \\"As the connection between journalists and politicians is umbilical in Washington, Blumenthal's political problem, in part, is journalistic,\\" reporter Michael Powell wrote of him in a profile in the Washington Post: \\"His is a type found far more often on the right in Washington, a partisan warrior who takes a critically sympathetic stance not just toward his issues but his chosen political party as well. Even as a writer at The Washington Post, where Blumenthal passed some time in the 1980s, he placed a porous membrane between his political views and his writing. It is the sort of partisan, if also intellectual, engagement that makes mainstream journalists, even those of liberal politics, deeply uncomfortable.\\"Michael Powell, \\"Blumenthal, Giving As Good as He Gets \\". The Washington Post, September 25, 1998. Early life and career Blumenthal was born in Chicago, to Jewish parents, Claire (n√©e Stone) and Hyman V. Blumenthal. He earned a BA in Sociology from Brandeis University in 1969, and began his career in Boston as a journalist who wrote for the Boston Phoenix and the Real Paper, Quad Monthly-issued publications. In 1983, Blumenthal became the chief national political correspondent for The New Republic, covering the 1984 Presidential campaign. Soon after, Blumenthal began working as a political reporter for The Washington Post before then returning to The New Republic. In 1993, Blumenthal became the chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker before joining the Clinton Administration in the summer of 1997. =Tenure as chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker= In 1995, when Blumenthal was named the chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker, the position was one of the most prestigious in American journalism. But Blumenthal's tenure in the position proved tumultuous, with several of his colleagues alleging that Blumenthal's journalism exhibited extreme bias in favor of then President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, that Blumenthal was informally providing political and public relations advice to the Clintons while covering both of them, and that Blumenthal was engaged in disparaging and attacking The New Yorker colleagues whom he believed were writing too critically of the Clintons. The Washington Posts media critic Howard Kurtz wrote at the time: > Peter Boyer, a New Yorker writer, says Blumenthal tried to sabotage his > story about the Travelgate affair last year. Boyer says he mentioned the > piece to his colleague after learning that Blumenthal had lunched with > Clinton's friend Harry Thomason on the day the Hollywood producer pushed for > the firing of the White House travel office employees...

The > Washington Post , June 16, 1997. Not too long into the job, Blumenthal was replaced as The New Yorkers chief Washington correspondent by Michael Kelly, although Blumenthal was allowed to stay on as a part-time writer: \\"Kelly ordered Blumenthal to stay away from the magazine's downtown office,\\" the Posts Kurtz wrote. Kelly himself explained to the newspaper: \\"I did not trust him. [Blumenthal]. I felt his relationship . . . with the president and first lady was such that I was not sure I wanted him around the office as I was working on stories. He was serving two masters, and I was not comfortable with that. . . . I had reason to believe that he wanted a job with the White House.\\" Over time, Blumenthal was eased out of his job: \\"The New Yorker assignments dwindled,\\" Kurtz wrote, and Blumenthal worked officially for the Clinton White House. =Clinton Administration years= Blumenthal (right) briefs President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office in 1998. Blumenthal served as assistant and senior advisor to Bill Clinton from August 1997 until January 2001. His roles included advising the President on communications and public policy as well as serving as a liaison between the White House and former colleagues in the Washington press corps. He later became a central figure in the grand jury investigation that ended in the impeachment of President Clinton. While working for Clinton, Blumenthal was known for this loyalty to the Clintons and his attacks on their adversaries, which is one reason Rahm Emanuel, the first chief of staff for President Barack Obama, barred Blumenthal from holding a position in the State Department during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. During his tenure working at the Clinton White House, Blumenthal was accused of serving as a \\"hatchet man\\" for the Clintons, often circulating rumors and false allegations about the Clinton's political adversaries: \\"Going back to the Bill Clinton impeachment crisis, Mr. Blumenthal, then the president's special adviser, spread false rumors that one of Kenneth Starr's prosecutors abused young boys at a Christian summer camp and that Monica Lewinsky was stalking the president,\\" according to a November 2015 report by journalist Ken Silverstein appearing in The New York Observer.\\"Just Who is Sidney Blumenthal, the Clinton's Closest Advsior?\\". The New York Observer, November 13, 2015. \\"In 1995, Mr. Blumenthal told reporters that Alma Powell, Colin Powell's wife, suffered from clinical depression and was thus unfit to be a first lady. At the time, there were rumors that Colin Powell would run in the Republican presidential primaries, a prospect that terrified the Clinton re-election campaign,\\" The New York Observer further reported. During the investigations by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, Blumenthal was called to the grand jury to testify on matters related to what Clinton had told both Blumenthal and his senior staff in regard to Monica Lewinsky. The leadership of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives felt enough evidence existed in regard to the Paula Jones case and Lewinsky for impeachment proceedings to begin in December 1998. After the House Judiciary Committee and the United States House of Representatives impeached Clinton on December 19, the matter then passed to the United States Senate. Blumenthal was one of only four witnesses called to testify before the Senate. No live witnesses were called; the four were interviewed on videotape. His testimony addressed a major allegation that Clinton had pressured Betty Currie to falsely attest that it was Lewinsky who initially pursued Clinton, not vice versa. The Senate acquitted Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, and the impeachment proceedings ended. Blumenthal v. Drudge In 1997, Blumenthal filed a $30 million libel lawsuit against the Internet blogger Matt Drudge (and AOL, which had hired Drudge), stemming from a false claim Drudge had made of spousal abuse, attributed only to unnamed \\"top GOP sources\\". Drudge retracted the story not long after, saying he had been given bad information. In Blumenthal v. Drudge, 992 F. Supp. 44 (D.D.C. 1998), the court refused to dismiss Blumenthal's case for lack of personal jurisdiction. Drudge publicly apologized to the Blumenthals. Blumenthal dropped his lawsuit and eventually reached a settlement involving a nominal payment to Drudge over Blumenthal having missed a deposition. In his book The Clinton Wars, Blumenthal claimed that he was forced to settle because he could no longer financially afford the suit.\\"Should Libel Law Be Strengthened to Protect Plaintiffs?\\", FindLaw.com, August 23, 2001.\\"Is AOL Responsible for Its Hip Shooter's Bullets?\\" . Columbia Journalism Review, November 1997. Retrieved May 21, 2015. Blumenthal‚ÄìHitchens feud The British-American journalist and author Christopher Hitchens, under subpoena, submitted an affidavit to the trial managers of the Republican Party during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, in which Hitchens swore under oath that then-friend Blumenthal had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker. Hitchens' allegations directly contradicted Blumenthal's own sworn deposition during Clinton's impeachment trial that he never said any such thing, which resulted in a hostile exchange of words between the two men. Following the publication of The Clinton Wars, in which Blumenthal recounted the disagreement, Hitchens wrote several articles in which he once more accused Blumenthal of lying.\\"Thinking Like an Apparatchik\\". The Atlantic, July/August 2003. Retrieved May 21, 2015. =Post‚ÄìClinton Administration years= Published works and memoirs After the Clinton presidency, Blumenthal's book, The Clinton Wars, was published in 2003. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote: \\"Beyond his intention to set the record straight on controversies that plagued the Clinton presidency, Mr. Blumenthal has a more personal agenda. Barely mentioning others close to the Clintons, and illustrating this memoir with smiling, convivial photographs of himself in their company ... Blumenthal sends a clear message to his administration colleagues: Mom liked me best.\\"\\"Clinton's Good Soldier Explains All Those Messes\\". The New York Times, May 15, 2003. Maslin further wrote: \\"The Clinton Wars means to solidify Mr. Blumenthal's place in history. He wrote memos and speeches (included here for the reader to enjoy). He gave valued advice. He came up with the slogan One America, which, he helpfully points out, is 'an updating of E pluribus unum. He introduced President Clinton to a promising British politician named Tony Blair. And he was often in the presence of greatness. 'I once sat with the president and Tony Blair as, in about 15 minutes, the two men easily thrashed out a prickly trade problem involving bananas and cashmere,' he reveals.\\" Reviewing the book in The New York Review of Books, Joseph Lelyveld, the former executive editor of The New York Times, wrote that Blumenthal came across as more like a \\"courtier\\" than \\"the bright campaign reporter he once was ... When it comes to the Clintons, there is not a single line of comparable acuity or detachment in the whole of The Clinton Wars. What you get instead are passages that would have been regarded as above par but hardly fresh if they had appeared in a news magazine cover story ten years ago.\\"\\"In Clinton's Court\\". The New York Review of Books, May 29, 2003. Also in The New York Times, historian Robert Dallek wrote that Blumenthal's book was partly \\"an exercise in score settling\\" against his \\"tormentors.\\" Moreover, Dalek wrote, \\"The book is also an exercise in something all too familiar to inside-the-White-House memoirs -- an exaggerated picture of the participant's importance. Comparing himself to the Antichrist in the eyes of the Christian right, Blumenthal \\"wondered which of my traits had invited this invective.\\" Holding center stage, as his massive volume attests, might be one answer.\\"Dallek, Robert. \\"The President's Man\\". The New York Times, May 18, 2003. Overall though, Dalek praised the book, opining that \\"Blumenthal's sprawling 800-page memoir of his four years as a presidential assistant\\" was a \\"welcome addition to the literature on Bill Clinton's tumultuous second term.\\" Dalkek also wrote that \\"Blumenthal brings a reporter's keen eye for telling detail and a columnist's talent for considered analysis and unmistakable opinion to his reconstruction of what he calls the Clinton wars.\\" Andrew Sullivan has characterized Blumenthal as \\"the most pro- Clinton writer on the planet.\\" For Salon, Dwight Garner wrote that Blumenthal's pieces as Washington correspondent of The New Yorker \\"were so unabashedly pro-Clinton that they quickly became the butt of countless jokes.\\" In addition to The Clinton Wars (2003), Blumenthal's other books include The Permanent Campaign (1980), The Rise of the Counter-Establishment (1986), Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War (1990), and How Bush Rules: Chronicles of a Radical Regime (2006), a collection of previously published essays and articles on the presidency of George W. Bush. Return to journalism During the 2004 presidential election, Blumenthal was the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for Salon. He also was a regular columnist for The Guardian from August 2003 until November 2007. Film work Blumenthal was a political consultant for the Emmy-award-winning HBO series Tanner '88, written by Garry Trudeau and directed by Robert Altman; he appeared as himself in one episode. He was also an executive producer of the documentary Taxi to the Dark Side, directed by Alex Gibney, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary of 2007. He also was an associage producer of the 2002 film Max. Relationship to Hillary Clinton and post‚Äì2007 employment Blumenthal joined the 2008 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign as a \\"senior advisor\\" in November 2007. While on a trip to advise Clinton on her presidential campaign, Blumenthal was arrested for driving while intoxicated in Nashua, New Hampshire, on January 7, 2008. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor DWI charge. After her January 2009 appointment as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton wished to hire Blumenthal. However, Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, blocked his selection due to lingering anger among President Barack Obama's aides over Blumenthal's role in promoting negative stories about Obama during the Democratic primary. According to a report in The New York Times, \\"Emanuel talked with Mrs. Clinton ... and explained that bringing Mr. Blumenthal on board was a no-go. The bad blood among his colleagues was too deep, and the last thing the administration needed, he concluded, was dissension and drama in the ranks. In short, Mr. Blumenthal was out.\\" According to a profile of Blumenthal which later appeared in Vanity Fair, when Hillary Clinton \\"wanted Blumenthal to join her at the State Department as a top aide.... President Obama would not allow it: key White House staffers had grown to detest the man. Two of them ‚Äì Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Senior Adviser David Axelrod ‚Äì threatened to quit if Blumenthal was hired.\\" \\"They believed that he [Blumenthal] had been involved in spreading unsubstantiated allegations against the Obamas during the 2008 Democratic primary... Blumenthal was [said to be\\" 'obsessed'... about the possible existence of a so-called 'whitey tape,' supposedly made at a Chicago church, in which Michelle Obama could be heard ranting against ‚Äúwhitey‚Äù‚Äîa tape that could have changed Clinton's political fortunes during her primary fight, but that apparently did not in fact exist.\\" The information that Blumenthal distributed to journalists and political operatives often paralleled conspiracy theories about Obama espoused by conservative activists and conspiracy theorists, often based on scant evidence or unsubstantiated rumors. = Promotion of Obama \\"birtherism\\" conspiracy theories = During the 2008 presidential primaries, Blumenthal, then informally working for Hillary Clinton, promulgated rumors and encouraged news organizations to investigate conspiracy theories that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, not the United States, and thus was not constitutionally eligible to serve as President per the natural-born-citizen clause. This conspiracy theory was more widely known as birtherism. A former Washington bureau chief for McClatchy Newspapers, James Asher, said in a formal statement in the fall of 2016 that Blumenthal had strongly encouraged him \\"to investigate the exact place of President Obama's birth, which he suggested was in Kenya. We assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and that reporter determined that the allegation was false\\". Blumenthal denied the allegations and claimed, without evidence, that Asher favored Donald Trump's candidacy. The Clinton campaign denied knowledge that Blumenthal or any other campaign aides promoted birtherism conspiracy theories. No evidence has since surfaced contradicting the campaign's denials that it knew anything as to what Blumenthal had been doing.\\"Did Sid Blumenthal really push birtherism?\\". Politico, September 19, 2016.\\"2 Clinton supporters in ‚Äô08 reportedly shared Obama ‚Äòbirther‚Äô story\\". McClatchy, September 16, 2016. = Clinton Foundation work = Blumenthal was a full-time employee of the Clinton Foundation from 2009 until 2013 an then served as a consultant for the foundation from 2013 until 2015, earning for him about $10,000 per month, or more than a half million dollars total. Blumenthal's foundation job, which \\"focused\\" on burnishing \\"the legacy of Clinton's presidency\\" was viewed by some \\"officials at the charity [who] questioned his value and grumbled that his hiring was a favor from the Clintons,\\" Politico reported. During much of the same time was consulting for the foundation, Blumenthal also wrote for numerous magazines and online publications, sometimes about both of the Clintons, without disclosing his financial relationship with the foundation. Critics charge that Blumenthal's work at the foundation was inappropriately politically motivated and that during his time at the foundation, he blurred the lines between the foundation and Secretary Clinton's role as Secretary of State. During the 2011 uprising in Libya against Muammar Gaddafi, Blumenthal prepared, from public and other sources, about 25 memos which he sent as emails to Clinton in 2011 and 2012, which she shared through her aide, Jake Sullivan, with senior State Department personnel. In the form of intelligence briefings, the memos sometimes touted his business associates and, at times contained inaccurate information.

Jung described the animus as the unconscious masculine side of a woman, and the anima as the unconscious feminine side of a man, each transcending the personal psyche. Jung's theory states that the anima and animus are the two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the unconscious mind, as opposed to the theriomorphic and inferior function of the shadow archetypes. He believed they are the abstract symbol sets that formulate the archetype of the Self. In Jung's theory, the anima makes up the totality of the unconscious feminine psychological qualities that a man possesses and the animus the masculine ones possessed by a woman. He did not believe they were an aggregate of father or mother, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, or teachers, though these aspects of the personal unconscious can influence a person's anima or animus. Jung believed a male's sensitivity is often lesser or repressed, and therefore considered the anima one of the most significant autonomous complexes. Jung believed the anima and animus manifest themselves by appearing in dreams and influence a person's attitudes and interactions with the opposite sex. Jung said that \\"the encounter with the shadow is the 'apprentice-piece' in the individual's development ‚Ä¶ that with the anima is the 'masterpiece'\\".Jung quoted in Anthony Stevens On Jung (London 1990) p. 206 Jung viewed the anima process as being one of the sources of creative ability. In his book The Invisible Partners, John A. Sanford said that the key to controlling one's anima/animus is to recognize it when it manifests and exercise our ability to discern the anima/animus from reality. Origin = Anima = Anima originated from Latin, and was originally used to describe ideas such as breath, soul, spirit or vital force. Jung began using the term in the early 1920s to describe the inner feminine side of men. = Animus = Animus originated from Latin, where it was used to describe ideas such as the rational soul, life, mind, mental powers, courage or desire. In the early nineteenth century, animus was used to mean \\"temper\\" and was typically used in a hostile sense. In 1923, it began being used as a term in Jungian psychology to describe the masculine side of women. Levels of anima development Jung believed anima development has four distinct levels, which in \\"The psychology of the transference\\" he named Eve, Helen, Mary and Sophia. In broad terms, the entire process of anima development in a man is about the male subject opening up to emotionality, and in that way a broader spirituality, by creating a new conscious paradigm that includes intuitive processes, creativity and imagination, and psychic sensitivity towards himself and others where it might not have existed previously. =Eve= The first is Eve, named after the Genesis account of Adam and Eve. It deals with the emergence of a man's object of desire. The anima is completely tied up with woman as provider of nourishment, security and love. The man at this anima level cannot function well without a woman, and is more likely to be controlled by her. He is often impotent or has no sexual desire. =Helen= The second is Helen, an allusion to Helen of Troy in Greek mythology. In this phase, women are viewed as capable of worldly success and of being self-reliant, intelligent and insightful, even if not altogether virtuous. This second phase is meant to show a strong schism in external talents (cultivated business and conventional skills) with lacking internal qualities (inability for virtue, lacking faith or imagination). =Mary= The third phase is Mary, named after the Christian theological understanding of the Virgin Mary (Jesus' mother). At this level, women can now seem to possess virtue by the perceiving man (even if in an esoteric and dogmatic way), in as much as certain activities deemed consciously unvirtuous cannot be applied to her. =Sophia= The fourth and final phase of anima development is Sophia, named after the Greek word for wisdom. Complete integration has now occurred, which allows women to be seen and related to as particular individuals who possess both positive and negative qualities. The most important aspect of this final level is that, as the personification \\"Wisdom\\" suggests, the anima is now developed enough that no single object can fully and permanently contain the images to which it is related. Levels of animus development Jung focused more on the man's anima and wrote less about the woman's animus. Jung believed that every woman has an analogous animus within her psyche, this being a set of unconscious masculine attributes and potentials. He viewed the animus as being more complex than the anima, postulating that women have a host of animus images whereas the male anima consists only of one dominant image. Jung stated that there are four parallel levels of animus development in a woman.Jung, Carl. The Psychology of the Unconscious, Dvir Co., Ltd., Tel-Aviv, 1973 (originally 1917) =Man of mere physical power= The animus \\"first appears as a personification of mere physical power - for instance as an athletic champion or muscle man, such as 'the fictional jungle hero Tarzan'\\".M.-L. von Franz, \\"The Process of Individuation\\" in Carl Jung ed., Man and his Symbols (London 1978) p. 205-6 =Man of action or romance= In the next phase, the animus \\"possesses initiative and the capacity for planned action...the romantic man - the 19th century British poet Byron; or the man of action - America's Ernest Hemingway, war hero, hunter, etc.\\"von Franz, \\"Process\\" p. 205-6 =Man as a professor, clergyman, orator= In the third phase \\"the animus becomes the word, often appearing as a professor or clergyman...the bearer of the word - Lloyd George, the great political orator\\". =Man as a spiritual guide= \\"Finally, in his fourth manifestation, the animus is the incarnation of meaning. On this highest level he becomes (like the anima) a mediator of...spiritual profundity\\".von Franz, \\"Process\\" p. 206-7 Jung noted that \\"in mythology, this aspect of the animus appears as Hermes, messenger of the gods; in dreams he is a helpful guide.\\" Like Sophia, this is the highest level of mediation between the unconscious and conscious mind. In the book The Invisible Partners, John A. Sanford said that the key to controlling one's anima/animus is to recognize it when it manifests and exercise our ability to discern the anima/animus from reality.Sandford, John A. The Invisible Partners: How the Male and Female in Each of Us Affects Our Relationships, 1980, Paulist Press, N.Y. Anima and animus compared The four roles are not identical with genders reversed. Jung believed that while the anima tended to appear as a relatively singular female personality, the animus may consist of a conjunction of multiple male personalities: \\"in this way the unconscious symbolizes the fact that the animus represents a collective rather than a personal element\\".von Franz, Process p. 206 The process of animus development deals with cultivating an independent and non-socially subjugated idea of self by embodying a deeper word (as per a specific existential outlook) and manifesting this word. To clarify, this does not mean that a female subject becomes more set in her ways (as this word is steeped in emotionality, subjectivity, and a dynamism just as a well-developed anima is) but that she is more internally aware of what she believes and feels, and is more capable of expressing these beliefs and feelings. Thus the \\"animus in his most developed form sometimes...make[s] her even more receptive than a man to new creative ideas\\".von Franz, Process p. 207 Both final stages of animus and anima development have dynamic qualities (related to the motion and flux of this continual developmental process), open-ended qualities (there is no static perfected ideal or manifestation of the quality in question), and pluralistic qualities (which transcend the need for a singular image, as any subject or object can contain multiple archetypes or even seemingly antithetical roles). They also form bridges to the next archetypal figures to emerge, as \\"the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form, representing the Self\\".von Franz, Process p. 207-8 \\\\- the archetypes of the Wise Old Woman/Man Jungian cautions Jungians warned that \\"every personification of the unconscious - the shadow, the anima, the animus, and the Self - has both a light and a dark aspect....the anima and animus have dual aspects: They can bring life-giving development and creativeness to the personality, or they can cause petrification and physical death\\".von Franz, \\"Process\\" in Jung, Symbols p. 234 One danger was of what Jung termed \\"invasion\\" of the conscious by the unconscious archetype - \\"Possession caused by the anima...bad taste: the anima surrounds herself with inferior people\\".C. G. Jung, The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious (London 1996) p. 124 Jung insisted that \\"a state of anima possession...must be prevented. The anima is thereby forced into the inner world, where she functions as the medium between the ego and the unconscious, as does the persona between the ego and the environment\\".C. G. Jung, Alchemical Studies (London 1978) p. 180 Alternatively, over-awareness of the anima or animus could provide a premature conclusion to the individuation process - \\"a kind of psychological short-circuit, to identify the animus at least provisionally with wholeness\\".Jung, Alchemical p. 268 Instead of being \\"content with an intermediate position\\", the animus seeks to usurp \\"the self, with which the patient's animus identifies. This identification is a regular occurrence when the shadow, the dark side, has not been sufficiently realized\\".

It deals with a variety of characters living at or visiting an Antarctic research station. It incorporates many of Robinson's common themes, including scientific process and the importance of environmental protection. Overview Most of the story is centred on McMurdo Station, the largest settlement in Antarctica, which is run as a scientific research station by the United States. Robinson's characteristic multiple-protagonist style is employed here to show many aspects of polar life; among the viewpoints presented are those of X, an idealistic young man working as a General Field Assistant at McMurdo; Val, an increasingly embittered trek guide; and Wade Norton, who works for the California Senator Phil Chase (Wade and Phil also appear in the \\"Science in the Capital\\" trilogy). As well as McMurdo, the story involves the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station, the Shackleton Glacier, the McMurdo Dry Valleys and a South American drilling platform near Roberts Massif. Themes Antarctica involves many of the ideas Robinson uses elsewhere; as in the Mars trilogy, much emphasis is placed on the importance of living sustainably and the issues of existing in a hostile environment. The significance of Antarctica as a \\"continent for science\\" is contrasted with the need to provide a decent environment also for the support staff essential in a place so marginal. Other recurring themes include rock-climbing, physical athleticism, the process and ideology of science, exploitation of natural resources, and the formation of cooperative and anarchic social systems. The novel was heavily influenced by Robinson's 1995 stay in Antarctica as part of the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Artists and Writers Program, and was nominated for a Locus Award in 1998. While researched in great detail, and generally accurate, some reviews noted that the book was in parts slowed down by heavy amounts of technical and historic detail.

His name is from Old Turkic bay, \\"rich\\", and √ºlgen, \\"magnificent\\". √úlgen is believed to be without either beginning or end. Features In Turkic and Mongolian mythology, the birch tree, regarded as a cosmic axis between earth and sky, was regarded as sacred to him, as was the horse (horse-sacrifice was a part of his worship).Horse Sacrifice and The Shaman's Ascent to The Sky, Adapted from: Mircea Eliade √úlgen symbolizes goodness, welfare, abundance, plentiness of food, water, etc. Furthermore, he created earth, heaven and all living beings. In addition, he controls the atmospheric events and movements of stars.Altay ve ≈ûor Mitolojisinde √úlgen Tanrƒ±sƒ± He creates land for people to live on, the heads of both humans and animals and the rainbow. He was regarded as the patron god of shamans and the source of their knowledge. It is believed that √úlgen has been created from Tengri (Tengere Kayra Khan). He is the highest deity after Tengri in the Mongo-Turkic pantheon. Often, √úlgen is compared with Tengri and at times they are thought to be on par, or even the same. In some sayings, the name/function of √úlgen may be (partially) interchangeable with that of Tengri. √úlgen is described as the enemy of Erlik who is the god of evil and darkness. √úlgen assumes the protectorship of humankind against him. Bai-√úlgen lives on the sixteenth floor of the sky above the stars, sun and moon in a golden house. Mere humans may never reach him, excepting shamans or kams, who possess astral powers. Animals are used for sacrifice in worship of him, especially horses. Once in every third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth year, a shaman may sacrifice a white horse as the first step of reaching √úlgen. Then he must ride its soul, penetrate through all the layers of heaven until he reaches √úlgen. Firstly, the kam (shaman) meets Yayƒ±k who is the servant of √úlgen. This entity informs the kam whether or not the offering has been accepted. If the sacrificial rite has been successful, the shaman is able to learn from the omniscient √úlgen of impending dangers, such as bad harvests.

His parents were both natives of the Gorizia and Gradisca region: his father, Franc Rusjan, was a Slovene, and his mother, Grazia Cabas, was Friulan. Rusjan spent his childhood and adolescence in Gorizia, in the suburb of Rafut. In his youth, he became a professional bicyclist, and designed his own bicycle models, together with his brother Josip Rusjan. He was also member of the Sokol gymnastic association. He made his first flight on 25 November 1909, near Gorizia, in Eda I, a biplane of his own design. Eda was Edvard's nickname, given by his mother. The flight was covered and reached a height of . On 29 November 1909, he flew at an altitude of . The original design was followed by several improved versions. He moved to a hangar near Miren south of Gorizia. Rusjan first attended a public flight event with the model EDA V on 6 December 1909, when his aircraft broke apart at landing. In June 1910, he tried the model EDA V, which enabled him to fly 40 meters above the ground and overfly the whole Miren Field. Replica of Rusjan airplane Eda V The brothers Rusjan ran out of finance for the construction of EDA VII. In 1910 Edvard Rusjan met the businessman of Serbian origin Mihajlo Merƒáep, who offered him financial help for his endeavors. The same year, the brothers moved to Zagreb, Croatia, when they started a project of airplane construction on larger scale. In November 1910, they constructed a new model. In January 1911, Edvard and Josip Rusjan went on a promotional tour through the Balkan cities. During a flight in Belgrade, Serbia on 9 January 1911 a strong wind broke a wing of Edvard's aeroplane and it dived into a railway embankment near the Belgrade Fortress in a fatal crash. His funeral was attended by a large crowd of about 14,000 people. He is interred at Belgrade's New Cemetery, lot 15, grave 343.

After the war Niwa became an extremely prolific author of more than 80 novels, 100 volumes of short stories, and 10 volumes of essays. His most celebrated short story was The Hateful Age (Japanese Iyagarase no Nenrei, 1947, literally \\"The Age of Disgust\\"), about a family terrorised by a senile grandmother, which enjoyed such popularity that the title became a phrase in the language, for a time. The novel The Buddha Tree uses his unhappy childhood at S≈çgen-ji as a backdrop. When he was eight years old his mother eloped with an actor from a Kansai Kabuki company; an event that greatly traumatised him. In this novel the story is elaborated fictionally. Later works include, from 1969, a five- volume biography of Shinran (1173-1262), the founder of the Pure Land sect, and in 1983 an eight-volume work on Rennyo, a 15th-century monk who died on a pilgrimage to India. In 1965 Niwa was elected a member of the Japan Art Academy, and the following year he was elected as Chairman of the Japanese Writers' Association, a position he held for many years. Niwa encouraged fellow members to play golf, organised health insurance, and bought land for a writers' cemetery. He won the 19th Yomiuri Prize and was awarded the Order of Culture in 1977. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1986.

It is a female personification of the Bavarian homeland, and by extension its strength and glory. The statue is part of an ensemble which also includes a hall of fame (Ruhmeshalle) and a stairway. It was commissioned by Ludwig I of Bavaria, with the specific design being chosen by competition. It was cast at the Munich foundry of J.B. Stiglmair between 1844 and 1850 and is the first colossal statue since Classical Antiquity to consist entirely of cast bronze. It was and is up to the present day considered a technological masterpiece. Because of its size it had to be produced in several parts; it is 18.52 metres (60 ft. 9 in.) high and weighs about 87.36 tons. It rests on a stone base which is 8.92 (28 ft.) metres high. An internal circular staircase leads up to a platform in the head, where four openings in the helmet provide a view of the Theresienwiese and downtown Munich. The Hall of Fame Because it forms a logical and artistic unit together with the Bavaria statue, a brief description of the historical background and construction of the Hall of Fame follows. Bust of Ludwig I in the Hall of Fame =Historical background= The childhood of Ludwig I was marked by the claims to power of Napoleon on the one hand, and Austria on the other. At that time the venerable House of Wittelsbach which he represented had been reduced to a plaything for the ambitions of these two major powers. Up until 1805, when Napoleon ‚Äúfreed‚Äù Munich in the War of the Second Coalition and made Ludwig's father, Maximilian, king of Bavaria, that nation had repeatedly been a theater of war and had suffered the disastrous consequences. Only after Napoleon's defeat in the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 did Bavaria enjoy a period of peace. This history prompted Ludwig already when he was crown prince to think in terms of a ‚ÄúBavaria comprising all tribes‚Äù and of a ‚Äúgreat German nation‚Äù. These goals motivated him in following years to undertake several projects involving the construction of national monuments like the pillar commemorating the Bavarian constitution of 1818 in Gaibach, the Walhalla temple on an imposing platform overlooking the Danube river and the town of Donaustauf east of Regensburg, the Hall of Fame in Munich (1853) and the Befreiungshalle (‚ÄúHall of Liberation‚Äù) near Kelheim (1863), all of which were privately financed by the king. In their design and contents, purpose and reception they convey an artistic and political harmony unique in Germany, despite their inner contradictions. Ludwig, who acceded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1825, felt a spiritual closeness to Greece, was an enthusiastic admirer of Ancient Greece, and wanted to turn his capital city of Munich into an ‚ÄúAthens on the Isar River‚Äù. Ludwig's second born son Otto was proclaimed King of Greece in 1832. =Construction= Already as crown prince Ludwig had the plan to erect a patriotic monument in his royal capital of Munich. He consequently had lists drawn up of ‚Äúgreat‚Äù Bavarians from all walks of life. In 1833 he launched a competition which was intended to collect preliminary ideas for the design of a hall of fame and thus only specified the project's key features: the hall was to be erected above the Theresienwiese and provide space for about 200 busts. The only requirement was, ‚Äú... that the building should not duplicate the Walhalla; as many Doric temples as there were, none of them was a copy of the Parthenon ....‚Äù Front view of the ensemble of the Bavaria statue and the Hall of Fame (Ruhmeshalle) The regulations did not exclude a building in the style of the Classicists as in the Walhalla, a parallel construction project, but it can be assumed that the architects were free to submit other architectural styles. Since the proposals of all four participants have survived to a large extent, they provide an interesting glimpse at the construction history of the Hall of Fame at a time of ideological artistic disputes between the Classicists on the one side, who were inspired by the aesthetics of Antique Greece and Rome, and the Romanticists on the other side, whose artistic manifestations were expressed in Medieval terms. Thus the proposals submitted for the design of the Hall of Fame reflected not only artistic and architectural differences, but these ideological disputes as well. Ludwig finally decided in March 1834, primarily for reasons of expense, against the proposals of Friedrich von G√§rtner, Joseph Daniel Ohlm√ºller and Friedrich Ziebland, and commissioned Leo von Klenze to construct the Hall of Fame. He was undoubtedly influenced by the colossal statue in Klenze's design, since such a huge statue had not been erected since Classical Antiquity. Flattered by the idea of erecting a statue which would be as imposing as those commissioned by the rulers of antiquity, after deciding in favor of Klenze's design Ludwig I wrote, ‚ÄúOnly Nero and I can produce such giant statues....‚Äù History =Iconography= Leo von Klenze‚Äôs proposals Leo von Klenze, court architect of Bavarian King Ludwig I, first proposed in 1824 a design for the Bavaria statue in the form of a ‚ÄúGreek amazon‚Äù, his inspiration being such monumental statues as the Colossus of Rhodes, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. and especially Phidias‚Äô Athena Parthenos, which survived in numerous small Roman copies. After the competition to design the Hall of Fame was decided in favor of Klenze, he drew up several proposals for the Bavaria statue in addition to his detailed drawings of the intended Hall. These sketches show a Bavaria statue influenced by classical representations of an Amazon. She wore a double girdled chiton and high laced sandals. With her right hand she crowned a multiheaded Herma whose four faces symbolize the ideal qualities of a ruler, of a warrior, the arts, and science. In her left hand she held at arm's length at hip level a wreath which she symbolically bestowed on honored personalities. A lion crouched at her left side. With this suggestion Klenze created a new type of national allegory. For a long time previously there had been personifications of Bavaria, but whereas, for example, the attributes of Tellus Bavarica on the Hofgartentempel represented the material wealth of the nation, Klenze gave his Bavaria attributes of culture and statesmanship. Klenze's design reflected a new understanding of the ideal state as virtuous and enlightened, replacing traditional agrarian symbolism. In another proposal dating from 1834, Klenze planned the Bavaria statue as an exact copy of the Athena Promachos which once stood in front of the Acropolis. She was provided with a helmet, shield and raised spear. On May 28, 1837 a contract to produce the Bavaria statue was signed by Ludwig I, Klenze, the sculptor Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler and the metal founder Johann Baptist Stiglmaier and his nephew, Ferdinand von Miller. Ludwig I and the participating artists were certainly aware of the plans for Arminius statues in Teutoburg Forest dating from the 1920s, although these were carried out after the Bavaria statue. Schwanthaler‚Äôs proposals Schwanthaler's plaster model of 1840 In contrast to Klenze, who was influenced by Classical Antiquity, Schwanthaler was a disciple of the Romantic Movement and a member of several Munich medieval circles, all of which were enthusiastic about anything ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù and rejected foreign impulses, especially those from Classical Antiquity. It was apparently part of Ludwig's strategy to combine these contrary artistic conceptions in a single patriotic monument, thereby uniting the opposing camps under one national ideal. His attempt at a synthesis of Classical and Romano-Gothic styles is often referred to in the literature as ‚ÄúRomantic Classicism‚Äù or the ‚ÄúLudovician Style‚Äù. At first Schwanthaler adhered to the specifications of Klenze's plan. But he soon began to come up with his own variations of the Bavaria statue. He made the fundamental decision not to follow Classical models but rather to clothe her in a ‚ÄúGermanic‚Äù style: her floor length shirt dress was draped in a simpler way, and bound up together with a bearskin it gave the figure a typical ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù character according to Schwanthaler. Schwanthaler went a step further in a plaster model dated 1840. He decorated the head with a wreath of entwined oak leaves, and the wreath in the raised left hand, which in the Klenze version was made of laurel leaves, became another oak leaf wreath, the oak being considered an intrinsically German tree. These modifications to the Bavaria statue occurred at the time of the so-called Rhine Crisis of 1840/41, which involved border disputes between France and the German Confederation and led to a surge of patriotic outbursts against the ‚Äúarchenemy‚Äù France. For Schwanthaler, who was in any case an enthusiastic patriot, this crisis seems to have been the motivation for portraying his Bavaria statue as emphatically fit to fight and armed with a drawn sword. Left hand holding a wreath of oak leaves The Bavaria statue's attributes of bearskin, oak wreath and sword can be relatively easily interpreted as a consequence of the political and art history context of its genesis, but an interpretation of the lion is more problematic. Although it is natural to regard the animal simply as a symbol of Bavaria, this does not really reflect the intention of Klenze and Schwanthaler. The lion always had a firm place in heraldry for the rulers of Bavaria, as Counts of the Rhine Palatinate the House of Wittelsbach had included it in its coat of arms since the High Middle Ages. In addition, two rampant lions served as supporters in the Bavarian coat of arms from the earliest times. The art historian Manfred F. Fischer is, however, of the opinion that the lion next to the Bavaria statue is not only conceived as Bavaria's heraldic animal, but along with the drawn sword is meant to be a symbol of defensive potential. But the most important attribute of the Bavaria statue remains the oak-leaf wreath in her left hand. The wreath signifies an honorary award for those whose busts are to be positioned inside the Hall of Fame. =Construction = The bronze statue was sand-cast using a process resulting in four major parts (head, bust, hips, lower half with lion) and a number of smaller pieces which were attached later. Interior scene of the metal foundry in Munich where the Bavaria statue was produced, showing the head and left arm castings Klenze proposed that the huge statue be cast in bronze. Ever since Classical Antiquity this alloy had been an esteemed material, valued for its long-lasting qualities, and Ludwig, who wanted to create an enduring legacy, strongly favored bronze. The king therefore supported the Munich metal founder Johann Baptist Stiglmaier and his nephew Ferdinand von Miller and revived the long tradition of bronze casting in Munich by setting up a new foundry, the Royal Metal Foundry (K√∂nigliche Erzgie√üerei), which went into operation on Munich's Nymphenburger Strasse in 1825. From the end of 1839 on, Schwanthaler and numerous assistants were engaged in producing a full-sized plaster model of the Bavaria statue. In 1844 an initial, four meter high auxiliary model had been completed. In late summer 1843 the finished full-size model could be dismantled in preparation for using the pieces as models for the castings. Stiglmaier died before this work could begin in 1844 and Miller took over leadership of the project. On September 11, 1844 the head of the Bavaria statue was cast using metal from bronze Turkish cannon salvaged from the 1827 naval Battle of Navarino (modern-day Pylos on the west coast of the Peloponnese peninsula). These cannon had been sold in Europe as recycling material under the then Greek King Otto, son of Ludwig I, and a number of them had reached Bavaria.Ursula Vedder: Die Bavaria vor der Ruhmeshalle und andere ‚ÄûBr√ºder‚Äú und ‚ÄûSchwestern‚Äú des Kolo√ü von Rhodos‚Äù, which includes four subsections on the statue In January and March 1845 the arms were cast and on October 11, 1845 the bust. The hip section was cast the following year and in July 1848 the entire upper portion of the statue was finished. The last major casting, for the lower section, took place on December 1, 1849. On March 20, 1848 Ludwig I was forced to abdicate the throne in favor of his son Maximilian, which had consequences for the continuation of the monument project since the Bavaria statue and the Hall of Honor, as with all of Ludwig's national monuments, were carried out and financed privately. Although Maximilian obligated himself to continue the project, only 9,000 guilders per year were allocated for it in his budget, which was completely inadequate. Miller, who had advanced the costs for the casting from his own resources, got into serious financial difficulties. Only when Ludwig agreed to privately finance the completion of the Bavaria statue could it be finished. In all, the Hall of Fame cost the king 614,000 guilders, the Bavaria statue 286,346 guilders and the property on which they stood 13,784 guilders. Miller was never recompensed for part of the costs, but the beneficial advertising effects for the foundry turned out to be so great that his expenses could be more than recovered from the many orders the company subsequently received, and the later privatized foundry remained in business until up into the 1930s. Over one hundred other major bronze works of art located worldwide were produced in this foundry, including Klenze's obelisk on Munich's Karolinenplatz, Bertel Thorvaldsen‚Äôs statue of Friedrich Schiller on Stuttgart‚Äôs Schillerplatz, and Christian Daniel Rauch‚Äôs statue of Maximilian I of Bavaria in front of the National Theater in Munich.A complete list in tabular form can be found at :de:K√∂nigliche Erzgie√üerei in M√ºnchen#Produkte. =Assembly and dedication in 1850= Final assembly of the statue in 1850 The formal unveiling of the Bavaria statue was originally planned for the Oktoberfest in 1850, which would have been the 25th year of Ludwig‚Äôs reign. Before any celebrations were held featuring a king who had meanwhile abdicated, government concerns first had to be dispelled that such an event could be interpreted as a demonstration against the ruling monarch, Maximilian II. Between June and August the separate pieces of the Bavaria statue were transported to the place of installation on especially constructed wagons, each drawn by 20 horses. On August 7, 1850 the last piece, the head, was escorted to the Theresienh√∂he in a festive procession through Munich. The official unveiling took place on October 9 after a procession including all involved trades and guilds and, as expected, turned into a tribute for the king who had abdicated. The artists whom the king had greatly supported in the years of his reign and provided with commissions thanks to his extensive construction program paid special homage to Ludwig. After the unveiling of the Bavaria statue, the speaker for the occasion expressed on behalf of the Munich art world, ‚Äúthe gratitude and praise of the present time and times to come‚ÄîBavaria‚Äôs bronze oak leaf wreath belongs especially to King Ludwig, patron of the arts‚Äù (translation)Christian Schaaf: Die Ruhmeshalle und die Bavaria in M√ºnchen als partikularstaatliches Nationaldenkmal.

The Hall of Fame had not been completed at the time of the Bavaria statue unveiling; scaffolding and wooden roofing obscured large portions of the building. Only in 1853 could it be dedicated as part of a far more modest celebration. The Bavaria ensemble during the Third Reich The Nazis had an ambivalent and cynical relationship to the Hall of Fame and the Bavaria statue. On the one hand, the various plans they developed to redesign the fairgrounds on the Theresienwiese including the Bavaria and the Hall of Fame betrayed a total lack of respect for the location and the intention of their founders. For example, in 1934 they considered demolishing the Hall of Fame behind the Bavaria statue to make space for exhibition grounds, and the Theresienwiese was to be fragmented by avenues for large parades. In 1935 another plan was presented to eliminate the Bavaria statue as well, and in its place to erect a huge congress hall with a memorial for heroes. According to plans from 1938, the Bavaria and Hall of Fame were to be retained, but framed by enormous monumental buildings. The Theresienwiese was to be modified. On the other hand, the open space of the Theresienwiese and the existing imposing and symbolic architecture were readily used for propagandistic staging, for example for the mass events connected with the pompous May Day celebrations which took place until the outbreak of World War II, as is evident in accounts written by the tightly controlled press.For a report (in German) about the Munich celebrations on May 1, 1934 see DGB Region M√ºnchen: Der 1. Mai in M√ºnchen Renovation The scaffolded Bavaria statue during renovation, August 2002 An investigation of the Bavaria statue by experts revealed such serious damage that the statue had to be closed to visitors in 2001. In all, over 2,000 separate flaws were detected.Information on the results of the laser scanning can be found at http://www.arctron.de/3D-Vermessung/3D-Laserscanning/Beispiele/Bavaria/Video.php Note that only the German pages have the informative videos showing the flaws (click Detailansichten und Schadenskartierung) and the individual segments of the cast (click Gu√üsegmente). In the course of the renovation work which was immediately initiated and cost some one million euro, the raised arm was stabilized and the entire outside surface was cleaned, polished and sealed. A completely new inner circular stairway was built. In order to help finance the renovation work, replicas in various scales were made based on the one model which had been produced by Schwanthaler, the tip of the small finger, including one that could be used as a drinking vessel, as well as other objects of craftsmanship, all of which, as well as a publication, were sold. Work on the statue continued until the beginning of the Oktoberfest in September 2002. During the entire period of repair the statue was hidden under a scaffold, whose outside surfaces were made available for advertising. The base of the statue was not renovated at the time and continues to be in need of repair. Subsequent casts Recast of the right hand, in the Deutsches Museum In 1907, Oskar von Miller, son of Ferdinand von Millers and founder of the Deutsches Museum in Munich, arranged to have a full-size casting made of the right hand of the Bavaria statue. It was produced at the Royal Metal Foundry Ferdinand von Miller, consists of the same material as the original (92% copper, 5% zinc, 2% tin, 1% lead), has a wall thickness of 4-8 millimeters, and weighs 420 kilograms. This copy has been on display ever since in the metallurgy collection of the Deutsches Museum.

Its 2005 English translation was among \\"The 10 Best Books of 2005\\" from The New York Times and received the World Fantasy Award for 2006.  Plot summary Comprising two distinct but interrelated plots, the narrative runs back and forth between both plots, taking up each plotline in alternating chapters. The odd-numbered chapters tell the 15-year-old Kafka's story as he runs away from his father's house to escape an Oedipal curse and to embark upon a quest to find his mother and sister. After a series of adventures, he finds shelter in a quiet, private library in Takamatsu, run by the distant and aloof Miss Saeki and the intelligent and more welcoming Oshima. There he spends his days reading the unabridged Richard Francis Burton translation of One Thousand and One Nights and the collected works of Natsume S≈çseki until the police begin inquiring after him in connection with a brutal murder. The even-numbered chapters tell Nakata's story. Due to his uncanny abilities, he has found part-time work in his old age as a finder of lost cats (Murakami's earlier work The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle also involves searching for a lost cat). Having finally located and returned one particular cat to its owners, Nakata finds that the circumstances of the case have put him on a path which, unfolding one step at a time before him, takes the illiterate man far away from his familiar and comforting home territory. He takes a gigantic leap of faith in going on the road for the first time in his life, unable even to read a map and without knowing where he will eventually end up. He befriends a truck driver named Hoshino, who takes him on as a passenger in his truck and soon becomes very attached to the old man. What appear to be random and irrelevant occurrences and situations are actually crucial to the final outcome for all. Major concepts Kafka on the Shore demonstrates Murakami's typical blend of popular culture, mundane detail, magical realism, suspense, humor, an involved plot, and potent sexuality. It also features an increased emphasis on Japanese religious traditions, particularly Shinto. The main characters are significant departures from the typical protagonist of a Murakami novel, such as Toru Watanabe of Norwegian Wood and Toru Okada of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, who are typically in their 20s or 30s and have rather humdrum personalities. However, many of the same concepts that were first developed in these and other previous novels re-occur in Kafka on the Shore. The power and beauty of music as a communicative medium is one of the central ideas of the novel--the very title comes from a song Kafka is given on a record in the library. The music of Beethoven, specifically the Archduke Trio is also used as a redemptive metaphor. Metaphysics is also a central concept of the novel as many of the character's dialogues and soliloquy are motivated by their inquiry about the nature of the world around them and their relation to it. Among other prominent ideas are: the virtues of self-sufficiency, the relation of dreams and reality, the threat of fate, the uncertain grip of prophecy, and the influence of the subconscious. G. W. F. Hegel has an influence on the book and is referenced directly at one point. Characters =Humans= ; Kafka Tamura : The character's true given name is never revealed to the reader. After having run away from home, he chooses the new name \\"Kafka\\", in honor of writer Franz Kafka. Kafka is described as being muscular for his age and a \\"cool, tall, fifteen-year-old boy lugging a backpack and a bunch of obsessions\\" . He's also the son of the famous sculptor Koichi Tamura. His mother and sister left the family when he was four years old and he can't remember their faces. He occasionally interacts with his metaphysical alter ego \\"The boy named Crow\\" (\\"Kafka\\" sounds like \\"kavka\\", which means \\"jackdaw\\", a crow-like bird, in Czech). Crow tells Kafka throughout the novel that he must be \\"the toughest fifteen-year-old in the world\\" and thus motivates him to pursue the journey of running away from home. It is heavily suggested throughout the novel that he, Miss Saeki, and Nakata are somehow connected by an 'alternate reality' on which metaphysical objects from people's subconsciousness take form leading them to find an 'essence' to their lives in exchange for taking away a 'part' of their soul. ; Satoru Nakata : Nakata lost many of his mental faculties when he was a child; as one of sixteen schoolchildren on a mushroom-gathering field-trip toward the end of World War II, they were rendered unconscious following a mysterious flash of light in the sky (although it is later revealed that the light wasn't the main cause). This event is referred to in the novel as the \\"Rice Bowl Hill incident\\". Unlike the other children, who recovered shortly after, Nakata remained unconscious for many weeks and, upon finally awakening, found that his memory and ability to read had disappeared, as well as his higher intellectual functions (i.e. abstract thinking), essentially making him a \\"blank slate\\". In their place, Nakata found he was able to communicate with cats. It is hinted that Nakata and Miss Saeki have been through the 'alternate reality' before and it's where they left a 'part' of their 'soul', leading to their shadows being irregular compared to normal people's. ; Oshima : A 21-year-old, intellectual, haemophiliac, and gay transgender man. He is a librarian and an owner of a cabin in the mountains near Komura Memorial Library who becomes close to Kafka throughout the course of the novel. He becomes the mentor of Kafka as he guides him to the answers that he's seeking on his journey. ; Hoshino : A truck driver in his mid-twenties. He befriends Nakata, due to his resemblance to his own grandfather, and transports and assists him towards his uncertain goal. ; Miss Saeki : The manager of a private library, where Oshima works and where Kafka lives through much of the novel. She was previously a singer, and performed the song \\"Kafka on the Shore\\", which unites many of the novel's themes. Although her outward appearance makes her look normal, she suffers from an existential crisis after the death of her boyfriend. She journeyed to the 'alternate reality' when she was 15 years old due to her strong desire to keep her happiness forever, eventually discovering the 'essence' used to compose \\"Kafka on the Shore\\". However it led to that version of herself 'separating' from her. ; Sakura : A young woman whom Kafka meets on the bus by chance. She assists him later in his journey. She is later raped by Kafka in a dream. ; Johnnie Walker : A cat killer who plans to make a flute out of cats' souls. His name is taken from Johnnie Walker, a brand of Scotch whisky, and he dresses to appear like the man featured in the brand's logo. ; Colonel Sanders : An 'abstract concept' who takes the form of a pimp or hustler. He is named after, and takes the appearance of, Harland Sanders, the founder and face of Kentucky Fried Chicken. He helps Hoshino to find the 'entrance stone' to the 'alternate reality.' =Cats= ; Goma: A lost cat owned by Mrs. Koizumi. ; Otsuka: An elderly black cat with whom Nakata easily communicates. ; Kawamura: A brown cat who was addled after being hit by a bicycle. Though they can communicate, Nakata is unable to understand Kawamura's repetitive and strange sentences. ; Mimi: An intelligent Siamese cat. ; Okawa: A tabby cat. ; Toro: A black cat that temporarily became an 'abstract concept'. Understanding the novel After the story's release, Murakami's Japanese publisher invited readers to submit questions to its website on the meaning of the book. Murakami responded personally to around 1,200 of the 8,000 questions received. In an interview posted on his English- language website, Murakami says that the secret to understanding the novel lies in reading it several times: \\"Kafka on the Shore contains several riddles, but there aren't any solutions provided. Instead, several of these riddles combine, and through their interaction the possibility of a solution takes shape. And the form this solution takes will be different for each reader. To put it another way, the riddles function as part of the solution. It's hard to explain, but that's the kind of novel I set out to write\\". Reception The novel received a 79% rating from the review aggregator iDreamBooks based on 31 book critics' reviews. John Updike described it as a \\"real page-turner, as well as an insistently metaphysical mind-bender\\". Since its 2005 English-language release (2006 PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize-winning translation by Philip Gabriel), the novel has received mostly positive reviews and critical acclaim, including a spot on The New York Times 10 Best Books of 2005 and the World Fantasy Award.

It was the last to feature Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart in Doctor Who, though he later reprised the role one more time on television in the Sarah Jane Adventures serial Enemy of the Bane. In the serial, Morgaine (Jean Marsh), a sorceress from another dimension, summons the planet-devouring Destroyer (Marek Anton) in England, where she also seeks to take the sword Excalibur for herself. The first episode's 3.1 million viewers remain the lowest ratings of any full episode of Doctor Who. Plot In response to a distress signal, the Seventh Doctor and Ace materialise the TARDIS near Lake Vortigern in England. The sound of explosions leads the Doctor and Ace to Brigadier Bambera of UNIT, in charge of a nuclear missile convoy. Following the encounter, the retired Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart is informed of the Doctor's return, and a helicopter is sent to his country home to collect him. At the Gore Crow hotel, the Doctor and Ace meet a young woman called Shou Yuing, who shares Ace's love of explosives. Meanwhile, as Bambera stops to examine a certain blue police telephone box at the side of the road, she is caught in the crossfire between two groups of armoured knights, using both swords and futuristic guns. The Doctor shows interest in a scabbard excavated from the battlefield, which hangs over the mantelpiece in the hotel. The scabbard is hot to the Doctor's touch, and the hotel owner's blind wife, Elizabeth, says she can sense it waiting for something, or someone. Archaeologist Warmsly dates the scabbard to the 8th century, but the Doctor senses that it is far older than that and has been waiting for something. As Ace and Shou Yuing share a talk about explosives, a knight sails through the roof of the hotel brewery. The Doctor, Ace and Shou Yuing find the knight, Ancelyn, who wakes to recognise the Doctor as \\"Merlin\\". While the Doctor mulls the portent of this revelation, the party is surrounded by an ominous group of knights. Bambera faces down their leader, Mordred, but Mordred is more frightened to see \\"Merlin\\", whom he believed was imprisoned by his mother, Morgaine. Following some vague threats from the Doctor (who is by this stage pretending that he knows exactly who Merlin is), Mordred's knights retreat. Later, as Mordred begins an arcane ritual, the scabbard in the hotel flies across the room, stirred by the magic. Morgaine then arrives on the scene through a rift in space and time. The next day, Warmsly shows the Doctor where he uncovered the scabbard. They find a rune, written in the Doctor's own handwriting, which he translates to \\"Dig hole here.\\" Using a canister of Nitro-9, Ace blows an opening. On arrival in Carbury, Lethbridge-Stewart's helicopter is shot down by Morgaine's sorcery. As Morgaine's knights hold a remembrance ceremony for the soldiers of Earth's world wars, Lethbridge-Stewart has a peaceable meeting with Morgaine ‚Äî though she warns Lethbridge-Stewart that, when they meet again in battle, she will kill him. Following the tunnel created by the Nitro-9 blast, the Doctor and Ace enter a chamber under the lake, finding a door programmed to open at the Doctor's voice. The Doctor tells Ace that \\"Merlin\\" may well be his future self. Presently, they realise that the chamber is part of an organic spaceship and find the body of King Arthur, lying next to a sword, which was apparently the source of the distress signal, and also lured Mordred and Morgaine. When Ace removes the sword from its plinth, she activates a defence mechanism, unleashing a hostile, glowing entity. Attempting to hide, Ace enters an alcove. A door closes, and the alcove starts to fill with water. As Ace yells for help, the entity knocks the Doctor unconscious. The Doctor recovers just in time to eject Ace from the spaceship, sending her shooting up through the waters of the lake. As Ancelyn and Warmsly stand at the shore, discussing the Lady of the Lake, Ace emerges, still grasping the sword. Ancelyn identifies it as Excalibur. The Brigadier arrives on-scene, in time to destroy the creature below the lake and rescue the Doctor. Mordred and Morgaine go to the hotel to retrieve Excalibur. Lavel, Lethbridge-Stewart's co-officer, shoots, but Morgaine simply catches her bullet with sorcery. Morgaine then takes knowledge from Lavel's mind, which kills her, and turns her body to dust. As Morgaine leaves, she pays for the drinking tab of her unruly son by restoring Elizabeth's sight. Meanwhile, UNIT troops are staging an evacuation. The Brigadier shows off some of UNIT's specialised ammunition, but when the Doctor jokingly enquires about silver bullets, the Brigadier rushes to get some. The Doctor instructs Ace to draw a chalk circle around herself to protect against Morgaine's sorcery. He then drives off in his old car, Bessie, hoping to halt a battle between Morgaine's knights and the UNIT soldiers. A storm breaks outside the hotel, so Ace and Shou Yuing draw the circle around themselves and Excalibur (which is the real source of their protection). Ace and Shou Yuing start to bicker, and Ace nearly leaves the circle before realising that Morgaine is toying with their minds. Just as Mordred and Ancelyn are about to fight, the Doctor intervenes. Mordred reveals that the battle was a ruse to lure the Doctor, and that Morgaine has summoned the Destroyer of Worlds, whom she has bound with silver chains. Morgaine appears before Ace and Shou Yuing and tries to entice them to hand over Excalibur. When they refuse, she unleashes the power of the Destroyer. The Doctor and the Brigadier capture Mordred and set off for the hotel. On return, the Doctor finds the hotel in ruins, but Ace and Shou Yuing safe. He is pleased to hear that Ace gave Excalibur to Morgaine, as doing so protected her. In the debris, the Doctor finds a portal to Morgaine's castle, and he, the Brigadier, and Ace bravely enter. On arrival, the Brigadier shoots the Destroyer, to no effect. The Destroyer's return volley sends the Brigadier flying through the window. Ace bursts through the portal, ramming into Morgaine, and knocking Excalibur from her grasp. Morgaine releases the Destroyer's bonds. In the confusion, she scoops up Excalibur, and heads back through the portal, along with Mordred. Outside, Ace tells the Doctor that Morgaine bound the Destroyer with silver chains, so he loads the Brigadier's revolver with the silver bullets. Although the Doctor wants to face the Destroyer himself, the Brigadier says that he is more expendable than the Doctor, and knocks the Doctor out, retrieving his gun so that he can face the Destroyer in the Doctor's place. The Brigadier marches back into the castle, tells the Destroyer, \\"Get off my world!\\", and then empties the revolver into the monster's chest. The Destroyer explodes, and the Doctor wakes to find the castle engulfed in flames. He spots the Brigadier's prostrate form and begins to mourn his fallen friend ‚Äî at which point the Brigadier opens his eyes and rises, unharmed. Back at the convoy, Morgaine and Mordred attempt to detonate the nuclear missile. The Doctor confronts Morgaine, insisting that there is no honour to nuclear warfare. Morgaine realises that he is right and asks to fight Arthur in single combat. The Doctor then tells her of Arthur's death, much to her sadness. Mordred and Morgaine are then imprisoned by Bambera (who has developed a relationship with Ancelyn). The Brigadier, the Doctor and Ancelyn are left to do the chores at the Brigadier's home while his wife, Ace, Shou Yuing and Bambera take off in Bessie to do some shopping. Chuckling, the Doctor says he'll cook supper. Production The story was repeated on BBC2 over four consecutive Fridays from 23 April ‚Äì 14 May 1993, achieving viewing figures of 1.6, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.2 million respectively. =Pre-production= Working titles for this story included Storm Over Avallion. The early story outlines included the death of Lethbridge-Stewart. In a deleted scene (included on the DVD release) the Doctor refers to one of Clarke's three laws ‚Äî telling Ace that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic ‚Äî to explain the various forms of magical attack used against them by the sorceress Morgaine, and also that Arthur's trans-dimensional spaceship was grown, not built. He adds that the reverse of Clarke's Law is also true. =Production= The first director approached to handle Battlefield was Graeme Harper, who had previously directed The Caves of Androzani and Revelation of the Daleks for the programme in 1984 and 1985 respectively. However, Harper was committed to episodes of the Central Independent Television drama series Boon, and unavailable to return to Doctor Who. During recording of the sequence where Ace is trapped in the glass water tank, the glass cracked, causing Sophie Aldred to sustain minor cuts to her hands and creating a major safety hazard as water flooded out onto the studio floor, across which live wires were running. The moment when the tank first cracked can be seen in Part Three as the Doctor struggles with the controls and Ace is lifted clear of the water. Sylvester McCoy shouted out to the stage hands above her to pull her quickly out before the tank exploded. =Cast notes= Nicholas Courtney returned explicitly as the Brigadier for the first time since The Five Doctors in 1983, Courtney's small cameo role in 1988's Silver Nemesis having been unidentified. Courtney took part in that serial playing a tourist standing on a tour of Windsor Castle, and exchanging only a single line with another character. It was never indicated whether the man was the retired brigadier or an unrelated character. Other guest stars making return appearances in Battlefield include Jean Marsh, who over twenty years earlier had played Princess Joanna in The Crusade and later, companion Sara Kingdom in The Daleks' Master Plan, which had been, coincidentally, Nicholas Courtney's first Doctor Who story;Courtney portrayed Kingdom's fellow Space Security Agent, Bret Vyon in The Daleks' Master Plan and June Bland, who appeared in the Fifth Doctor story Earthshock. Angela Bruce later reprised the role of Brigadier Winifred Bambera in the audio play Animal. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Marc Platt, was published by Target Books in July 1991. The novel features a prologue in which the future Merlin Doctor takes the wounded King Arthur aboard the spaceship beneath the lake following the last battle as well as additional information about the current version of U.N.I.T. and Morgaine's dimension. The final scene also implies that the Brigadier is planning to go with Ancelyn back to the other dimension to help restore order, a similar plot point to the ending of the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Shadows of Avalon. It was the last novelisation of a televised Doctor Who serial to be published in the traditional \\"short paperback\\" format Target had been using since 1973. After one more novelisation based upon the audio story The Pescatons, all remaining novelisations were published in paperback editions with greater page counts and a different format. =Home media= Battlefield was released on VHS in March 1998 with two minutes of additional footage not shown in the 1989 broadcast. It was released on Region 2 DVD on 26 December 2008 as a Special Edition featuring the original televised story plus a movie- length version featuring extended scenes and new special effects, with its scenes reedited into script order to clarify the story's themes and sequence of events. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 59 on 6 April 2011.

Highlighted by three hit singles written by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson (who composed two of the four hit songs on the first Gaye/Terrell duets LP, United), You're All I Need was recorded throughout 1966 and 1967 and features two Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits, \\"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\\" and \\"You're All I Need to Get By\\". It peaked at #60 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart. You're All I Need was the two singers' final collaboration effort, as Terrell would become ill following recording, before succumbing to a brain tumor in 1970. History The album was recorded in 1966 and 1967 during the time Gaye and Terrell's first collaboration album United was released. After recording You're All I Need, Tammi Terrell collapsed onstage while performing with Gaye at the Hampden‚ÄìSydney College homecoming in Virginia. She was later diagnosed with a brain tumor, and could no longer record nor perform live. According to Gaye, the final Gaye/Terrell album, Easy, would be completed by having Valerie Simpson fill in for Tammi Terrell on most of the album's songs, and having Gaye overdub archived Terrell solo tracks for two tracks. Simpson vehemently denies this and says they had to record Tammi's vocals in pieces in order to get the project done, but in the Unsung documentary about Terrell, she admits to singing guide vocals intended for the unavailable Terrell.

The house is named for its location ‚Äî adjacent to the village's plestor. Architecturally, the house has grown over the centuries. The oldest section, that facing the village green (known as The Plestor ‚Äî from the Saxon words pleg stow, meaning play space), dates from the third quarter of the 17th century. The roof incorporates fire-blackened timbers which have been dated by dendrochronology to the early 14th century, and it is thought that they come from the house which previously stood on the site. A recent excavation of the cellar unearthed Tudor bricks, which were also fire-damaged and may therefore point to the fate of the house's predecessor. The second section of the house dates from 1783, according to a stone set into the upper storey. The mortar lines between the local malmstones of this section are studded with pieces of iron, a local characteristic known as galletting. The most recent addition came at the turn of the 20th century. It effectively filled in the square formed by the L-shape of the two older wings. Attached to the house is an ancient building which was the first site of the village school. The school was originally endowed in 1728, under the will of the grandfather of Gilbert White, the early naturalist.

It was released simultaneously for the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family, Atari ST, Amiga, Macintosh, and IBM PC compatibles. Plundered Hearts is Infocom's only game in the romance genre. It is Infocom's twenty-eighth game. Plot Plundered Hearts casts the player in a well-defined role. The lead character is a young woman in the late 17th century who has received a letter. Jean Lafond, the governor of the small West Indies island of St. Sinistra, says that the player's father has contracted a \\"wasting tropical disease\\". Lafond suggests that his recovery would be greatly helped by the loving presence of his daughter, and sends his ship (the Lafond Deux) to transport her. As the game begins, the ship is attacked by pirates and the player's character is kidnapped. Eventually the player's character finds that two men are striving for her affections: dashing pirate Nicholas Jamison, and the conniving Jean Lafond. As the intrigue plays out, the lady does not sit idly by and watch the men duel over her; she must help Jamison overcome the evil plans of Lafond so they have a chance to live happily ever after. Feelies Infocom had a reputation for not only creating involving stories, but also for feelies, which were extra items included with each game. The Plundered Hearts package held: *an \\"elegant velvet reticule\\" (pouch) containing the following items: **a 50 guinea banknote from St. Sinistra **a letter from Jean Lafond reporting the illness of the player character's father Notes As early as 1984 Infocom employees joked about the possibility of a romance text adventure, although The Boston Globe observed that \\"somehow the moves don't seem appropriate to a computer keyboard\\". By 1987, the year of Plundered Hearts's release, Infocom no longer rated its games on difficulty level. Some fans consider the game to be equivalent to the company's \\"Standard\\" level. Although this was not the only Infocom game designed in an effort to attract female players (see also Moonmist), it is the only game in which the lead character is always female. (In some of Infocom's other works, the gender of the player's character is either unimportant and/or unaddressed, or could be chosen as either female or male, as in Bureaucracy, Beyond Zork, Ballyhoo, Moonmist, and Leather Goddesses of Phobos.) Like several other implementors, Amy Briggs began working at Infocom as a game tester before designing games. Plundered Hearts was the last release for the Atari 8-bit family.

Shayde is an artificial being, a construct of the Gallifreyan Matrix -- the massive computer network that serves as the repository of all Time Lord knowledge. He was created by the minds of the dead Time Lords that reside within the Matrix, and was a servant of Rassilon. He first appeared in the story The Tides of Time, published in DWM #61-#67, written by Steve Parkhouse and drawn by Dave Gibbons. In that story, he aided the Fifth Doctor in defeating the otherdimensional demon Melanicus, at first covertly but then, as the Time Lords increased his power levels, he was able to manifest himself and help the Doctor directly. Among Shayde's powers are the abilities to travel through space and time unaided, fire deadly self-generated \\"psychic bullets\\" and be invisible to security systems. He can also phase through solid objects and track people through time and space given enough data. Shayde next appeared when the TARDIS was possessed by an Elemental being. Having no instructions from the Time Lords, Shayde was allowed to act on his own and helped the Doctor expel the entity from the TARDIS. When the Doctor was placed on trial by the Time Lords for allowing the possession to take place and possibly placing Gallifrey in danger, Shayde surreptitiously erased the evidence, leading to the Doctor's acquittal (The Stockbridge Horror, DWM #70-#75). It was nearly fifteen years before Shayde reappeared in the comic strip. At that time, the Doctor was in his Eighth incarnation and was dying due to the events of the previous adventure (Tooth and Claw, DWM #257-#260). His companions at the time, Izzy and Fey had taken him back to Gallifrey where he was cured and his mind placed within the Matrix to recover. While within the Matrix, an attempt was made on the Doctor's life by a secret Time Lord sect known as the Elysians, and Shayde stopped them. The assassination attempt was part of a plot by Overseer Luther, an insane Time Lord who wanted to rewrite Gallifrey's history and set himself up as a god. The Doctor managed to thwart Luther by short-circuiting his watchtower (a gigantic TARDIS), but apparently at the cost of his eighth body. As Izzy and Fey watched, the Doctor regenerated into a new incarnation. (The Final Chapter, DWM #262-#265). However, this was a ruse. The Doctor had realised that Fey was under external control when she had managed to pilot the TARDIS even though the TARDIS manual was in Gallifreyan script, which she did not understand. Just before the Doctor prepared to sacrifice himself, Shayde offered to take his place and fake a regeneration. This way, the group that was controlling Fey -- the Threshold, a mercenary organisation that the Doctor had tangled with before -- would seize the opportunity to bring a newly regenerated and thus weaker Doctor to them. Both disguised with personal chameleon circuits, Shayde would hold their attention while the Doctor sabotaged the Threshold's operations. \\"Feyde\\" versus the Nazis. In a Wild West town on an alien moon run by the Threshold, the Doctor's plans came to fruition. When Shayde and the Doctor revealed themselves to the Threshold, Shayde had to contend with the Pariah, an immensely powerful being who was his predecessor. The Pariah was another construct of Rassilon, but he had tried to destroy her when she developed free will and rebelled. Now, the Pariah wanted to take revenge, not just on Gallifrey but the whole universe. Shayde was unable to defeat the Pariah on his own, and she crushed his skull. However, Fey merged with the dying Shayde and together they were able to kill the Pariah and eliminate the Threshold. The shared being, dubbed \\"Feyde\\" by the Doctor, although both of them retained their own consciousness, decided to leave and deal with what had just happened to them (Wormwood, DWM #266-#271). Fey returned to her own time period, the 1940s, where, as an agent of the British government, she spent two years fighting the Nazis and being frustrated that Shayde would not allow her to use their powers to kill Adolf Hitler, as this would change history. In 1941, she received a sub-ether summons from the Doctor -- Izzy had been kidnapped, and the Doctor needed Shayde's abilities to track her whereabouts. Together, they succeeded in recovering Izzy, and \\"Feyde\\" returned to World War II. Shayde is one of the few characters from the comic strip that has made the cross-over into the other spin-off media.

His writings and doctrinal research played a key role in shaping the Second Vatican Council. Early life and ordination Henri de Lubac was born in Cambrai to an ancient noble family of the Ard√®che. He was one of six children; his father was a banker and his mother a homemaker. The family returned in 1898 to the Lyon district, where Henri was schooled by Jesuits. A born aristocrat in manner and appearance, de Lubac studied law for a year before, aged 17, joining the Society of Jesus in Lyon on 9 October 1913. Owing to the political climate in France at the time as a result of the French anti-church laws of the early twentieth century, the Jesuit novitiate had temporarily relocated to St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, where de Lubac studied before being drafted to the French army in 1914 due to the outbreak of the Great War. He received a head wound at Les √âparges on All Saints Day, 1917, which would give him recurring episodes of dizziness and headaches for the rest of his life. Following demobilisation in 1919, de Lubac returned to the Jesuits and continued his philosophical studies, first at Hales Place in Canterbury and then, from 1920 to 1923, at the Maison Saint-Louis, the Jesuit philosophate located at that time in St. Helier, Jersey. It was here that he would encounter the thought of Maurice Blondel and Pierre Rousselot. The encounter with Blondel would prove especially important. In 1932, de Lubac would eventually write Blondel and tell him of his encounter with L'Action in the early 1920s, and how Blondel's thought around the problem of integralism became one of the central instigators of de Lubac's search for a renewed understanding of the relationship between nature and grace. De Lubac taught at the Jesuit College at Mongr√©, in the Rh√¥ne, from 1923 to 1924, and then in 1924 returned to England and began his four years of theological studies at Ore Place in Hastings, East Sussex. In 1926, the Jesuit college was relocated back to Fourvi√®re in Lyons, where de Lubac completed the remaining two years of his theological studies. He was ordained to the priesthood on 22 August 1927. Professor and theologian In 1929, de Lubac was appointed professor of fundamental theology at the Catholic University of Lyon (the required doctorate having been conferred by the Gregorian University in Rome at the behest of the Father General of the Society of Jesus, without de Lubac's setting foot there or ever submitting a dissertation). He would teach there from 1929 to 1961, though with two interruptions ‚Äì first during World War II, when he was forced underground because of his activities with the French Resistance, and then from 1950 to 1958, when the Society of Jesus, under pressure from Rome, removed him from his teaching responsibilities and the Fourvi√®re Jesuit residence. During the 1930s de Lubac spent his time teaching at the Catholic University and researching, as well as teaching (between 1935 and 1940) one course at the Jesuit seminary at Fourvi√®re (where he also lived from 1934 onwards). His first book, the now-classic Catholicisme (English title of the current edition: Catholicism: Christ and Common Destiny of Man) was published in 1938, before the war. In 1940, he founded the series Sources Chr√©tiennes (\\"Christian Sources\\"), co-edited with fellow Jesuit Jean Dani√©lou, a collection of bilingual, critical editions of early Christian texts and of the Church Fathers that has reinvigorated both the study of patristics and the doctrine of Sacred Tradition. During the Second World War, the first interruption to this pattern came: de Lubac joined a movement of \\"spiritual resistance,\\" assisting in the publication of an underground journal of Nazi resistance called , or Christian Testimony. It was intended to show the incompatibility of Christian belief with the philosophy and activities of the Nazi regime, both in Germany and also under the cover of the Vichy government in southern France, which was theoretically independent of the Reich. De Lubac was often in hiding from the Germans and several of his co-workers on the journal were captured and executed. Even in hiding, he continued to study and write. From 1944 onwards, with the end of the Nazi occupation of France, de Lubac came out of hiding and published a number of texts (many of them begun or completed before the war but not published in the early 1940s because of the shortage of paper) which became major interventions in twentieth-century Catholic theology. These included: Corpus Mysticum, which had been ready for publication in 1939, and appeared in February 1944; Drame de l'humanisme ath√©e, published in December 1944; De la connaissance de Dieu published in 1945; Surnaturel: √âtudes historiques (a book which de Lubac had started at Hastings in his student days), published in 1946 in a print run of 700 copies, because of the ongoing paper shortage. \\"The dark years\\" In June 1950, as de Lubac himself said, \\"lightning struck Fourvi√®re.\\" De Lubac, who resided at Fourvi√®re but actually did no teaching there, and four Fourvi√®re professors were removed from their duties (in de Lubac's case these included his professorship at Lyon and his editorship of Recherches de science religieuse) and required to leave the Lyon province. All Jesuit provincials were directed to remove three of his books (Surnaturel, Corpus mysticum, and Connaissance de Dieu) and one article from their libraries and, as far as possible, from public distribution. The action came through the Jesuit Superior General, Jean-Baptiste Janssens, under pressure from the curial office, and was because of \\"pernicious errors on essential points of dogma.\\" Two months later, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Humani generis, widely believed to have been directed at de Lubac and other theologians associated with the nouvelle th√©ologie, an intellectual movement characterized by renewed attention to the patristic sources of Catholicism, a willingness to address the ideas and concerns of contemporary men and women, a focus on pastoral work and respect for the competencies of the laity, and a sense of the Catholic Church as existing in history and affected by it. What de Lubac called \\"the dark years\\" lasted nearly a decade. It was not until 1956 that he was allowed to return to Lyon and not until 1958 that the University got verbal approval from Rome for de Lubac to return to teaching the courses he previously taught. Although everything de Lubac wrote during these years was subject to censorship in Rome, he never ceased to study, write, and publish. During these years he brought out a study of Origen's biblical exegesis (1950), three books on Buddhism (1951, 1952, 1955), M√©ditations sur l'√âglise (1953 ‚Äì a text which would have great influence on Lumen Gentium, the document produced at Vatican II on the nature of the church), and Sur les chemins de Dieu (1956). Return to acceptance His pioneering study Ex√©g√®se m√©di√©vale (1959‚Äì1965) revived interest in the spiritual exegesis of scripture and provided a major impetus to the development of covenantal theology. Just before and during the conciliar years, with the blessing of his order, de Lubac also began to write and publish books and articles in defense of the writings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, his older friend and fellow Jesuit, who had died in 1955. Teilhard's ideas had influenced several of the theologians of the nouvelle th√©ologie and had also met with extreme disfavour in Rome. Second Vatican Council In August 1960, Pope John XXIII appointed de Lubac as a consultant to the Preparatory Theological Commission for the upcoming Second Vatican Council. He was then made a peritus (theological expert) to the council itself, and later, by Pope Paul VI, a member of its Theological Commission (as well as of two secretariats). Although the precise nature of his contribution during the council is difficult to determine, his writings were certainly an influence on the conciliar and post-conciliar periods, particularly in the area of ecclesiology where one of his concerns was to understand the church as the community of the whole people of God rather than just the clergy. De Lubac's influence on Lumen gentium (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church) and Gaudium et spes (Constitution on the Church in the Modern World) is generally recognized. Late years In 1969 Pope Paul VI, an admirer of de Lubac's works, had proposed making him a cardinal but de Lubac demurred, believing that for him to become a bishop, as required of all cardinals, would be \\"an abuse of an apostolic office\\". Paul VI, having committed to creating a Jesuit cardinal, conferred the honor on de Lubac's junior colleague Jean Dani√©lou instead. In the years after Vatican II, de Lubac came to be known as a \\"conservative theologian\\", his views completely in line with the magisterium ‚Äì in contrast to his progressive reputation in the first part of his life. Contributing to this reputation, in 1972 de Lubac, alongside Joseph Ratzinger who later became Pope Benedict XVI, and Hans Urs von Balthasar, founded the journal Communio ‚àí a journal which acquired a reputation as offering a more conservative theology than Concilium. In 1983 Pope John Paul II offered to make de Lubac a cardinal, this time with a dispensation from being consecrated a bishop. De Lubac accepted and became the first non-bishop cardinal since the 1962 rule requiring cardinals to be bishops. In the consistory of 2 February 1983, Pope John Paul II raised de Lubac, at 87, to the College of Cardinals. He was created Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica. On 24 May 1990, de Lubac became the oldest living cardinal. He died in Paris in 1991.

Commodity currencies are most prevalent in developing countries (eg. Burundi, Tanzania, Papua New Guinea). In the foreign exchange market, commodity currencies generally refer to the New Zealand dollar, Norwegian krone, South African rand, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and the Chilean peso.  Effects  Due to the nature of commodity currencies being tied to commodities, being tied to any one good can be beneficial as well as problematic for the country. While falling or rising exports will lead to deflation or inflation respectively in any country, the impacts are more severe in countries with commodity currencies, as their currencies are so heavily tied to a set few commodities. = Positive = According to a 2009 study on commodity currency titled ‚ÄúCan Exchange Rates Forecast Commodity Prices?‚Äù by Yu-chin Chen, Kenneth Rogoff and Barbara Rossi, exchange rates of commodity currencies can predict future global commodity prices. This is hugely beneficial for economists and policymakers who want a reliable measure of future commodity prices. A currency that is naturally tied to a country‚Äôs major commodities can be beneficial if global demand for a commodity increases, naturally strengthening the value of the currency. As seen in Figure 1, as the demand for a commodity shifts out (higher demand) the price increases to p‚Äô. This increased demand also is likely to increase GDP, as more exports take place as demonstrated by the equation for GDP below. GDP=C+G+I+N_x C=Consumption G=Government Expenditure I=Investment N_x=Net Exports=(Exports-Imports) Figure 1 Figure 2 As exports increase due to higher demand, GDP will also increase greatly as this country relies heavily on this commodity, leading to higher prices causing inflation (indicated in Figure 2‚Äôs increase in the price level). Depending on whether the inflation is economically beneficial, this could be positive as noted in the positive effects section of the inflation article. It is important to note that while countries with commodity currencies benefit from higher demand, countries that import this commodity face the opposite effects. = Negative = On the other side, a currency being tied to the major commodities of a country can be problematic, as a decrease in demand for any specific commodity can take a huge toll on the country's currency, leading to deflation. As seen in Figure 3, as the demand for a commodity shifts in (less demand) the quantity decreases to q‚Äô. This decreased demand is likely to decrease GDP, as less exporting takes place, as demonstrated by the equation for GDP below. GDP=C+G+I+N_x C=Consumption G=Government Expenditure I=Investment N_x=Net Exports=(Exports-Imports) Figure 3 Figure 4 Similar to the reasoning in the previous section, as seen in Figure 4, a decrease in GDP leads to deflation. This can have negative or positive effects, depending on whether the nation's currency was overvalued or undervalued. Deflation can either be positive or negative in the long run as suggested by the effects section of the deflation article. It is important to note that while countries with commodity currencies benefit from higher demand of a commodity, countries that import this commodity face the opposite effects.  Investing  Commodity currencies' nature can allow foreign exchange traders to more accurately gauge a currency's value, and predict movements within markets based on the perceived value of the correlated commodity. Knowing which currencies are tied to which commodities can assist greatly with trading decisions. All in all, if looking to trade commodity currencies, it is extremely important to closely follow the price movements of the commodities to which they are correlated, and short or go long a currency accordingly.[3]  Externalities  Most commodities that are tied to currencies are natural resources such as gold, oil, timber and other minerals. However, the mining of these raw resources can lead to immense externalities such as pollution. Countries whose currencies do not hinge on commodity price movements are generally more willing to minimize harmful environmental processes, thus reducing affiliated externalities. Countries whose currencies are impacted profoundly by commodities are generally less willing to tighten their environmental policies which would reduce externalities. For example, the Canadian dollar is closely tied to soybeans and oil. The production of oil is extremely harmful to the environment. However, reducing oil production through Cap and Trade programs or production taxes can be devastating to the Canadian Dollar.

It was the third and final motion picture that Presley filmed in Hawaii. The film reached #40 on the Variety weekly box office chart, earning $2.5 million in theaters. In agreeing to do this film, Elvis' manager Colonel Tom Parker was hoping to replicate the success of Presley's 1961 film, Blue Hawaii. However, it was not a hit, and Presley's career continued its downward spiral. Plot Rick Richards (Presley) returns to his home in Hawaii after being fired from his job as an airline pilot. He and his buddy Danny Kohana (James Shigeta) go into the helicopter charter business together. But Rick's reckless flying and his careless flirting with local women may cost Rick the business and Danny his home.

Geography  Germencik is located in the middle of the fertile B√ºy√ºk Menderes (Meander) plain, inland from the Aegean coastal town of Ku≈üadasƒ±, on the Aydƒ±n-ƒ∞zmir highway from the city of Aydƒ±n. It is also the junction of the ƒ∞zmir-Aydƒ±n-Afyonkarahisar and Ortaklar-S√∂ke railway lines. Until the 1950s the plain was a swampy area subject to regular flooding and Germencik grew as people moved from the wet lands into the town. Today Germencik itself is a small town of 12,000 people, astride the Izmir-Aydƒ±n highway, providing high schools, a hospital, a library and other services for the surrounding district. There are more health centres and primary schools in the villages of the district. The economy of Germencik depends on agriculture, the main crops are figs and olives but cotton, sesame and other crops are also grown here. Of the 374.39 km2 total area of Germencik 255.8 km2 is planted and of the remainder 106.23 km2 is forest, 6.65 km2 is meadow/pasture, 5.19 km2 is unused and 0.52 km2 is lake or swamp. In 1998 16,950 tons of cotton were produced from 56.5 km2, 7,500 tons of figs from 87.22 km2 and 44,170 tons of olives from 92.92 km2. Sheep and cattle are raised too and there is a small dairy industry as well as bee-keeping and some poultry farming. Industry in the area is mainly the processing of the local produce to make tahini, halva, olive oil etc. The people live the traditional Turkish rural lifestyle with strong family ties etc. The women generally have their heads covered and wear long skirts.  History  Germencik is an old settlement, first founded by 'Hƒ±dƒ±r Bey' of the Aydinid Principality under the name \\"Deƒüirmencik\\" (little mill). Later, it has also been called \\"ƒ∞ƒüneabad\\". The town obtained district's status in 1948.  Places of interest  * The remains of the antique city of Magnesia on the Maeander are located on the west side of Route D525 between Ortaklar and S√∂ke, just west of the village of Tekin, in Aydƒ±n Province at 37¬∞51'N 27¬∞31'E. See Magnesia on the Maeander for more details of this city, founded by Ancient Greeks from Thessaly and in its day a key trading partner of Priene, Ephesus, Tralles and other major Aegean cities. The ruins have been excavated and include a theatre, temples and an Ancient Roman gymnasium, and baths. Magnesia was commercially and strategically at an important location in the triangle of Prien, Ephesus and Tralles. The first excavations at the archaeological site were made in 1891 by Carl Humann of the Berlin Museum. 21 Month long excavations revealed (partially or fully) the theatre, Artemis temple, agora, Zeus temple and prytaneion. Excavations resumed at the site, after almost 100 years, in 1984, by Prof. Dr. Orhan Bing√∂l on assignment from Ankara √úniversitesi and Turkish Ministry of Culture. Findings at the archaeological site are now displayed at museums of Istanbul, as well as Berlin and Paris, where they were illegally smuggled. The most important and the biggest piece smuggled outside Turkey is the whole fa√ßade of the Zeus temple (smuggled by the German archeological team), which is currently in possession of the Berlin Bergama Museum.

It is not driven by the specificity of details; rather, details emerge through a co-construction of the ultimate story by the various participants or elements.  Networked narratives as decentralized stories  Networked narratives can be seen as being defined by their rejection of narrative unity. As a consequence, such narratives escape the constraints of centralized authorship, distribution, and storytelling. One of the most visible forms of networked narrative has been the alternate reality game, an interactive scenario that is experienced through multiple channels and adapts to player behavior. Additionally, networked narratives have been represented in films such as Crash and Syriana through highly decentralized, threaded plots.  Networked narratives as social movements  Marco Deseriis breaks down networked narratives in three central functions: denotative, performing, and pragmatic. He claims that socially-created networked narratives: 1\\\\. Represent an initially unsolved conflict, dilemma, or other situation. 2\\\\. Invite viewers to perform a role in the story. 3\\\\. Are oriented around a system of beliefs or ethics that resonates with participants and allows them to create new stories. Internet activism, hacktivism, and the free software movement are principal examples of such narratives in practice. While adherents to these movements tend to share a common ethos, there is no central authority - the direction of the narrative hinges on its participants.

Early life and playing career Solich grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, and graduated from Holy Name High School in 1962, where he earned all-state, All-America, and all-scholastic honors. He scored 104 points in high school but was being overlooked due his height, 5'7\\", and weight, 153 lbs. When he got to his college weigh-in he got his trainer to tape 8 pound weights under his shorts. He now made weight at 162 lbs. He was a part of Bob Devaney‚Äôs first recruiting class at Nebraska, and became a standout for the Huskers in the mid-1960s, where he earned the nickname \\"Fearless Frankie\\". An All-Big Eight fullback and co-captain of the Huskers‚Äô 1965 team, his playing career earned him induction into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame in 1992. In NU's 27‚Äì17 win over Air Force in 1965, he ran for 204 yards on 17 carries, becoming the first Husker to run for 200 yards in a game, and subsequently the first Husker to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Coaching career =High school= He began his career in the Nebraska prep ranks, as head coach at Omaha Holy Name High School in 1966 and 1967. His 1967 team was state runner-up. Solich then moved to Lincoln Southeast for 11 years, where he compiled a record of 66‚Äì33‚Äì5 while capturing consecutive Class A state titles in 1976 and 1977. =Nebraska= Solich returned to college football at his alma mater in 1979, spending 19 seasons at Nebraska as an assistant coach under Tom Osborne: four as the freshman team coach, and 15 as running backs coach. In Solich's 19 years as an assistant, the Huskers captured three national championships and 11 conference titles. He was the position coach for many of Nebraska's standout running backs of the 1980s and 1990s, including Tom Rathman, Calvin Jones, Ahman Green, and Lawrence Phillips. Osborne retired after the 1997 national championship season and named Solich as his successor. Solich directed the Huskers to six consecutive bowl games, including his 2001 squad, which started 11‚Äì0 but was beaten by Colorado 62‚Äì36 in the last regular season game. Despite that loss and failing to qualify for the Big 12 championship game, the Huskers still made it into the national championship game (ahead of #3 Colorado and #2 Oregon) in the Rose Bowl against Miami. Nebraska was beaten 37‚Äì14. Solich did win at least nine games in five of those six seasons, and finished among the top 10 teams in the nation three times. Solich compiled a 58‚Äì19 record (.753) at Nebraska. Solich's 1999 Huskers defeated the Texas Longhorns for the Big 12 championship. Solich was named the Big 12 Coach of the Year in 1999 and 2001, and was one of seven finalists for the Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant Award in 2001. For the first five years as head coach, Solich served as his own offensive coordinator, as Osborne had for most of his tenure. His offenses centered on the option. He also utilized such plays as the Black 41 Flash Reverse Pass which became a highlight of Eric Crouch's Heisman Trophy-winning season in 2001. The Huskers slumped to 7‚Äì7 in 2002. He gave up offensive play-calling duties to newly hired offensive coordinator Barney Cotton and brought in Bo Pelini, the linebackers coach for the Green Bay Packers, as defensive coordinator. 2003 began with Nebraska starting out 5‚Äì0, but suffered three key losses later in the year: 41‚Äì24 to Missouri, 31‚Äì7 to Texas and 38‚Äì9 to Kansas State. After winning the final game of the regular season, Solich was fired by new athletic director Steve Pederson. Solich's 58 wins during his first six seasons as Nebraska's head coach exceeded those of his predecessors, Bob Devaney (53 wins) and Osborne (55 wins), both of whom are in the College Football Hall of Fame.Nebraska Yearly Totals on cfbdatawarehouse.com But Solich won only one Big 12 North title and conference championship in six seasons and had a 1‚Äì9 record on the road against ranked teams (0‚Äì9 in conference play), and the team had a drop-off in offensive production. =Ohio= After taking the 2004 season off, Solich was hired at Ohio University in Athens, and his impact on the football program was immediate. The renovation plans for the Ohio football facilities, which had begun eight years earlier and nearly complete (prior to 2004, the program was furnished with new coaches office, practice fields, a new 10,000 square-foot strength and conditioning center, enhancement to the team locker room, revitalization of Peden Stadium including installation of a state-of-the-art FieldTurf playing surface, improved and expanded seating complete with a popular concert-style berm at the south end zone) was finished off with the last two projects; new team meeting rooms and athletic training room. Fan interest in the program was revitalized and reached its highest since the 2001 season. Also, Ohio was selected to appear on national television six times for the 2005 football season, a record for the program. Solich's first home game as coach of the Bobcats was a memorable one, as Peden Stadium brought in its largest crowd ever. 24,545 fans were in attendance on September 9, 2005, to watch the Bobcats defeat the Pittsburgh Panthers, 16‚Äì10. The Pittsburgh‚ÄìOhio game was among the top 15 most viewed regular season college football games ever on ESPN2. The Bobcats' 2005 record under Solich (4‚Äì7) was the same as the team's record in the previous year under Brian Knorr. However, in 2006, Solich led the Bobcats to a 9‚Äì5 record including a MAC East Division title and a GMAC Bowl invitation. The bowl game (which Ohio lost to Southern Miss, 28‚Äì7) was the program's first bowl appearance since 1968. In the 2007 season, the Bobcats took a step backward and finished with a record of 6‚Äì6. Two of those losses were by less than three points, and a third was a 28‚Äì7 loss to nationally ranked Virginia Tech. The Bobcats were one of six bowl eligible teams that missed the postseason. On July 18, 2008, Solich was given an extension of his contract through the 2013 season. In 2009, Solich led the Bobcats to a 9‚Äì5 overall mark with another MAC East championship and an appearance in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. That 2009 senior class amassed more wins (28) than any other Ohio football class in more than 40 years. In 2011, Solich coached the Bobcats to a 10‚Äì4 record, another MAC East Division title, and their first ever bowl win. The Bobcats defeated Utah State 24‚Äì23 in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. It was Ohio's first ten win season since 1968. During the 2012 season, Solich coached the Bobcats to a 7‚Äì0 start, which saw their first Associated Press Top 25 weekly ranking since 1968, as well as a spot in the weekly coaches poll. In October 2018, Coach Solich celebrated his 100th win at Ohio University. A 66‚Äì24 victory over Bowling Green in November 2019 gave Solich his 111th win as Ohio coach, making him the winningest coach in MAC history. Personal life Solich married Pamela Wieck of Beatrice, Nebraska. They have two children, Cindy and Jeff. In 2005, police in Athens, Ohio found Solich passed out behind the wheel of his car, facing the wrong direction on a one-way street. Solich was convicted of drunken driving, resulting in a $250 fine and driver's license suspension. He attempted to fight this based on testing that revealed the \\"date rape\\" drug GHB in his system. His attempt to withdraw his plea failed.

While the AFRC briefly controlled the country in 1998, it was driven from the capital by a coalition of West African troops. It was no longer a coherent and effective organization by the elections of 2002. Description The AFRC was formed by Major Johnny Paul Koroma of the Sierra Leonean military in 1997, who used it to carry out a coup d'etat against the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. The former Sierra Leone Army (\\"ex- SLA\\") is a term used to refer to soldiers loyal to the AFRC. Several rationales have been suggested for the coup, including: anger at the government for not implementing the November 1996 peace agreement with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), perceived ethnic discrimination in the appointment of the highest ranks of government, perceived financial neglect of the armed forces, and favoritism for the ethnic Mende Kamajors led by Samuel Hinga Norman. Following the coup, in May 1997 the AFRC demanded that the Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force then in the country release the arrested RUF leader Foday Sankoh. Sankoh gave his blessing to the AFRC, and RUF forces who had been fighting in the countryside linked up with AFRC forces in the capital Freetown. Sankoh was named Vice-Chairman of the AFRC and several other RUF leaders were named to high positions. The AFRC and RUF thus formed a joint military junta controlling the country. However, in March 1998 the AFRC/RUF was forced out of Freetown by an invading West African force that put President Kabbah back in power. However, the rebels according to their respective origins, RUF and ex-SLA, under the renewed pressure, with a force of ex-SLA based in the Occra Hills, 50 km from the capital. The rebel AFRC regrouped to retake the capital in January 1999, but was again forced out by the Nigerian-led force. By 1999, the authority of the AFRC and Major Koroma over the ex-SLA had become very uncertain and the AFRC is commonly seen as devolving into bands of loosely associated combatants. The West Side Boys rebel group are sometimes referred to as an AFRC splinter group. The West Side Boys abducted several soldiers of the British army that were training West African peacekeepers in July 2000, and was subsequently destroyed by British forces in a September raid that freed the hostages. While many of the combatants who were under the command of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council continued to fight, the \\"AFRC\\" designation gradually ceased to become useful and the AFRC organization is no longer considered to exist.New African - N381 √† 391 - Page 17 2000 \\"Speaking on Koroma's behalf, the former AFRC minister of information, Mohamed Bangura, still in exile in London, said recendy: \\"Genuine democracy will only be assured when the nation becomes arms free.\\" After the folding of AFRC, Koroma's supporters have organized the Peace and Liberation Party.  Indictment and conviction  In June 2007, the Special Court found three of the eleven people indicted ‚Äì Alex Tamba Brima, Brima Bazzy Kamara and Santigie Borbor Kanu ‚Äì guilty of war crimes, including acts of terrorism, collective punishments, extermination, murder, rape, outrages upon personal dignity, conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years into armed forces, enslavement and pillage.

An Post archival notes local lore from the early 20th century that attests the origin of the village's name to that of Muintear Chlann Chonghaile or Clann Mhic Conghaile,https://www.logainm.ie/en/1413446 that is to say, the Conneelys. Location Settlements are spread out north on the road to Clifden and south on the road to Roundstone. This peninsula, jutting into the Atlantic Ocean between Clifden to the north and Roundstone to the south, is a mainly rural area. Its name is based on the old civil parish of Ballindoon, which in turn was named from the old fort or cashel on Doon Hill. The area is surrounded by beaches: the Coral Strand at Derrygimla; west and north to Knock, Mannin, Dunloughan and Truska; and east and south from Keeraunmore, Aillebrack, and Ballyconneely Bay to Calla, Dolan and Murvey. Some of these bathing spots provide bases for shore fishing. History In 1854, the first salmon farming operation in the United Kingdom was carried out on the Dohulla Fishery. In 1919, the first transatlantic flight by Alcock and Brown ended two miles away in Derrygimla Bog, an unsuitable landing place which damaged the aircraft. The crash landing was near the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Station The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System, Scientific American, 23 November 1907 built in 1905, which was used to send the first transatlantic wireless message, to Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, in 1907. A team of Dutch botanists studied lakes and water chemistry around Ballyconneelly in 1975 and throughout Ireland until 2010, due to the island's unique post-Ice Age landscape no longer found in the Netherlands. Tourism and amenities Every July, the Ballyconneely pony show attracts people from the surrounding county to exhibit livestock and visit the travelling funfair. Ballyconneely breeds Connemara ponies, including some home and overseas champions. Legend has it that the breed originated when Arabian horses come ashore from a Spanish shipwreck near Slyne Head and bred with the small native pony. Attractions include a 27-hole golf links, and Roundstone Bog three miles to the east, an expanse of moor, lake and stream, containing wildlife and rare plants. The beaches have edible shellfish and molluscs accessible at low tide, including clams, cockles, mussels, razorfish, sea urchins, shrimp and scallops, and with local knowledge, the occasional lobster. Connemara Smokehouse and Visitor Centre is located at the Aillebrack fishing pier, a small harbour used by local fishermen and boat owners. Two shops, a post office, a community hall, and a local parish hall make up the village centre. Other businesses in the area include a hotel, a golf course with club house, guest-houses, bed-and-breakfast establishments, and holiday homes. Former Taoiseach Brian Cowen has a holiday home in Dunloughan, close to the Connemara Golf Links.

Biography  Born in Vienna in 1929, Jantsch studied physics at the University of Vienna, where he obtained his doctorate in astrophysics in 1951. Subsequently he did a post-doctorate study at the Indiana University Bloomington another year. Jantsch had started his career as an astronomer at the University of Vienna, where he worked until 1957. In the mid 1950s he emigrated to the United States, but did not receive his green card until 1979. He continued to work in Europe and United States. From 1957 to 1962 Jantsch worked as engineer and physicist in Switzerland. In 1970 he was appointed Richard Merton Professor at the Technical University in Hanover, Germany. Jantsch lectured widely in Europe, North and South America, Near East and Japan. For example, he was visiting lecturer of Planning and Research Planner of International Studies, University of California, Berkeley. In 1974, Jantsch stayed at the Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio, \\"where he was one of the first distinguished residents invited by the Rockefeller Foundation\\". He was also Research Associate at MIT, where he studied the future of MIT and the American University. Jantsch was advisor to twenty governments, several international organizations and research institutes. Among others he was \\"consultant to the Directorate of Scientific Development of the O.E.C.D. and as a member of the executive committee of the Club of Rome.\\" As consultant to OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development); prepared studies on the world food problem, technological forecasting, higher education, etc. In 1971 he was the Austrian delegate to the first session of the UN Committee on Natural Resources. For the last few years of his life, Jantsch was without a job and lived in an \\"apartment in Berkeley: dark and depressing room, with massage parlors above and below; a typewriter, a plant, and scattered copies of his favorite newspaper, Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung\\". It was here that he finished his last book, The Self-Organizing Universe. He made a living and supported his mother \\"by giving lectures ail over the world, through writing, and by relying on a few friends\\". Jantsch died on December 12, 1980 in Berkeley, California \\"after a short but painful illness.\\"Capra, F. (1981). Erich Jantsch 1929‚Äì1980. Futures, 13(2), 150-151. He had been \\"alone and lonely, abandoned by friends, misunderstood by colleagues\\". His ashes were scattered over the Pacific Ocean.  Work  In the mid-1960s Jantsch's increasing concern regarding the future led him to study forecasting techniques. He did not believe that forecasting or science could be neutral.Trivia Library - Future Predictions of Famous Scientist Dr. Erich Jantsch by David Wallechinsky & Irving Wallace \\"The People's Almanac\\" 1975 - 1981 = The Self-Organizing Universe, 1979 = Jantsch's Gauthier Lectures in System Science given in May 1979 at the University of California in Berkeley became the basis for his book The Self- Organizing Universe: Scientific and Human Implications of the Emerging Paradigm of Evolution, published by Pergamon Press in 1980 as part of the System Science and World Order Library edited by Ervin L√°szl√≥. The book deals with self-organization as a unifying evolutionary paradigm that incorporates cosmology, biology, sociology, psychology, and consciousness. Jantsch is inspired by and draws on the work of Ilya Prigogine concerning dissipative structures and nonequilibrium states. Now out of print for many years, The Self-organizing Universe has been influential in the interdisciplinary fields of biomimicry, holism, co-evolution, and self-organization. It was extensively cited in Ken Wilber's integral philosophy book Sex, Ecology, Spirituality: The Spirit of Evolution.  Reception  Jantsch was described as \\"quiet and modest\\", but as an \\"original polymath and genius\\" by Ralph H. Abraham in \\"The Genesis of Complexity\\". Magoroh Maruyama wrote in a eulogy: > Jantsch succumbed at the age of 51 to the material and physical hardships > that worsened progressively during the last decade of his prolific and still > young life.

A 2014 collection of her essays, The Essential Ellen Willis, received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism.  Early life and education  Willis was born in Manhattan to a Jewish family, and grew up in the boroughs of the Bronx and Queens in New York City.Margalit Fox, Ellen Willis, 64, Journalist and Feminist, Dies, The New York Times, November 10, 2006. Her father was a police lieutenant in the New York City Police Department. Willis attended Barnard College as an undergraduate and did graduate study at University of California, Berkeley, where she studied comparative literature.  Career  In the late 1960s and 1970s, she was the first pop music critic for The New Yorker, and later wrote for, among others, the Village Voice, The Nation, Rolling Stone, Slate, and Salon, as well as Dissent, where she was also on the editorial board. She was the author of several books of collected essays. At the time of her death, she was a professor in the journalism department of New York University and the head of its Center for Cultural Reporting and Criticism.Official page on the site of the Department of Journalism, New York University, accessed July 7, 2007 =Writing and activism= Willis was known for her feminist politics and was a member of New York Radical Women and subsequently co-founder in early 1969 with Shulamith Firestone of the radical feminist group Redstockings.Ellen Willis, \\"Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism\\", 1984, collected in No More Nice Girls: Countercultural Essays, Wesleyan University Press, 1992, , pp. 117‚Äì150, especially pp. 119 and 124. She was one of the few women working in music criticism during its inaugural years when the field was predominantly male. Starting in 1979, Willis wrote a number of essays that were highly critical of anti-pornography feminism, criticizing it for what she saw as its sexual puritanism and moral authoritarianism, as well as its threat to free speech. These essays were among the earliest expressions of feminist opposition to the anti-pornography movement in what became known as the feminist sex wars. Her 1981 essay, Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex? is the origin of the term, \\"pro-sex feminism\\".Ellen Willis, Lust Horizons: The 'Voice' and the women's movement , Village Voice 50th Anniversary Issue, 2007. This is not the original \\"Lust Horizons\\" essay, but a retrospective essay mentioning that essay as the origin of the term. Accessed online July 7, 2007. A lightly revised version of the original \\"Lust Horizons\\" essay can be found in No More Nice Girls, pp. 3‚Äì14. She was a strong supporter of women's abortion rights, and in the mid-1970s was a founding member of the pro-choice street theater and protest group No More Nice Girls. A self-described anti-authoritarian democratic socialist, she was very critical of what she viewed as social conservatism and authoritarianism on both the political right and left. In cultural politics, she was equally opposed to the idea that cultural issues are politically unimportant, as well as to strong forms of identity politics and their manifestation as political correctness. In several essays and interviews written since the September 11 attacks, she cautiously supported humanitarian intervention and, while opposed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq,Ellen Willis, Ellen Willis Responds , Dissent, Winter 2003.

Willis wrote a number of essays on anti-Semitism, and was particularly critical of left anti-Semitism. Occasionally she wrote about Judaism itself, penning a particularly notable essay about her brother's spiritual journey as a Baal Teshuva for Rolling Stone in 1977.Ellen Willis, Next Year in Jerusalem, originally published in Rolling Stone, April 1977. She saw political authoritarianism and sexual repression as closely linked, an idea first advanced by psychologist Wilhelm Reich; much of Willis' writing advances a Reichian or radical Freudian analysis of such phenomena. In 2006 she was working on a book on the importance of radical psychoanalytic thought to current social and political issues. =Rock criticism= Willis was the first popular music critic for The New Yorker, between 1968 and 1975. As such, she was one of the first American popular music critics to write for a national audience. She got the job after having published only one article on popular music, \\"Dylan\\" in the underground magazine Cheetah, in 1967. In addition to her \\"Rock, etc.\\" column in the New Yorker, she also published criticism on popular music in Rolling Stone, the Village Voice, and for liner notes and book anthologies, most notably her essay on the Velvet Underground for the Greil Marcus \\"desert island disc\\" anthology Stranded (1979). Contemporary Richard Goldstein characterized her work as \\"liberationist\\" at its heart and said that \\"Ellen, Emma Goldman, and Abbie Hoffman are part of a lost tradition ‚Äî radicals of desire.\\" She was a friend of many contemporary critics, including Robert Christgau, Georgia Christgau, Greil Marcus, and Richard Goldstein. Christgau, Joe Levy, Evelyn McDonnell, Joan Morgan, and Ann Powers have all cited her as an influence on their careers and writing styles. At one point, she and Robert Christgau were lovers.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/books/review/robert-christgau-going- into-the-city.html In 2011, the first collection of Willis's music reviews and essays, Out of the Vinyl Deeps (University of Minnesota Press), arrived. It was edited by her daughter Nona Willis-Aronowitz. Ellen Willis \\"celebrated the seriousness of pleasure and relished the pleasure of thinking seriously,\\" a review in The New York Times said. It was announced that a conference at New York University, \\"Sex, Hope, & Rock 'n' Roll: The Writings of Ellen Willis\\", celebrated her anthology and pop music criticism on April 30, 2011. Death On November 9, 2006 she died of lung cancer. Her papers were deposited in the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, in the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University in 2008.

It debuted in 2006 on the 5.7 L modern Hemi V8. Like Mercedes-Benz's Active Cylinder Control, General Motors' Active Fuel Management, and Honda's Variable Cylinder Management, it deactivates four of the V8's cylinders when the throttle is closed or at steady speeds. The system was first offered only on passenger cars, since the heavy demands of trucks would interfere with its operation. However, it was recalibrated for 2006 and was offered on all seven models, including SUV's and 1500 series trucks, using the 5.7 L engine. Chrysler expected that the technology would boost economy by 10% to 20%. In the Jeep Grand Cherokee with MDS, highway fuel mileage for the V8 is the same as the V6 at 21 mpg (11.2 liters per 100 km). In order to preserve the characteristic rumble of the V8 engines, Chrysler and Eberspaecher North America designed a special exhaust system for MDS-equipped vehicles. This includes four separate mufflers, two large central ones for V8 mode and two smaller ones near the tailpipes for four-cylinder mode. Unlike the system used on Mercedes-Benz V12 engines, also designed by Eberspaecher, the system is mechanically passive.

In 1979, the first franchised Red Robin restaurant was opened in Yakima, Washington. Red Robin's headquarters are in Greenwood Village, Colorado. As of August 2020, the company had over 570 restaurants in operation with 90 being operated as a franchise.  History  The original Red Robin stood at the corner of Furhman and Eastlake Avenues E. in Seattle, at the southern end of the University Bridge. This building dated from 1940 and was first called Sam's Tavern. The owner, Sam, sang in a barbershop quartet and could frequently be heard singing the song \\"When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)\\". He liked the song so much that he eventually changed the name to Sam's Red Robin. A Red Robin restaurant in 2015 Red Robin's Gourmet Bacon Cheeseburger In 1969, local Seattle restaurant entrepreneur Gerry Kingen bought the restaurant and expanded it. The business dropped the \\"Sam's\\" and simply became Red Robin. The first restaurant was 1,200 sq ft (110 m¬≤). It was a favored hangout for University of Washington students. Kingen continued to operate the location as a tavern for a few years, but later added hamburgers to the menu, eventually giving fans 28 different burgers to choose from, and sales increased. After 10 years of building the Red Robin concept Kingen decided to franchise it, which proved to be significant in the development of the chain. Through franchising, and through one franchisee in particular, the chain drew its strength. Kingen's association with the company he founded later ended, but the franchising system endured, creating disciples of the gourmet burger format that extended the physical presence and geographic reach of the enterprise far beyond the efforts of its creator. In 1979, Kingen sold Michael and Steve Snyder the rights to open a Red Robin in Yakima, Washington and The Snyder Group Company became Red Robin's first franchisee. In 1980, Red Robin opened a restaurant in Portland, Oregon. In 1983, Red Robin adopted a mascot named Red. In 1985, Red Robin boasted 175 restaurants when the corporate headquarters was moved from downtown Seattle to Irvine, California after CEO Kingen sold a controlling interest in Red Robin Corp. to Skylark Corporation of Japan and where Michael Snyder had Red Robin offices. With marginal successes and poor financial performance under Skylark's management, Kingen, then a minority owner, in 1995 stepped back into Red Robin with Michael Snyder to nurse the company back to profitability. In 2000, the company opened its 150th restaurant. The headquarters was moved to the Denver Tech Center. In 2000, Red Robin merged with the Snyder Group, and Snyder became president, chairman and CEO of the merged company. Snyder took the company public in 2002. The original Red Robin closed on March 21, 2010 due to prohibitive maintenance costs for the old building. It was demolished on August 28, 2014. As of fiscal year 2015, the company had 538 restaurants with a revenue of US$1.25 billion.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers 2015 Annual Report On December 2, 2018, Michael Snyder committed suicide. Red Robin added a \\"simplified\\" line of restaurants called Red Robin's Burger Works featuring quick service and with locations in Washington, D.C., Illinois, Ohio, and Colorado. In September 2019, Paul J.B. Murphy III was appointed as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the Company's Board of Directors, effective October 3, 2019. In October 2019, the company announced plans to close its five locations in Alberta, Canada, by early December.

In 1979, Newman attempted to patent the device, but was rejected by the United States Patent Office as being a perpetual motion machine. When the rejection was later appealed, the United States district court requested that Newman's machine be tested by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The NBS concluded in June 1986 that output power was not greater than the input. Thus, the patent was again denied. The scientific community has rejected Newman's ideas about electricity and magnetism as pseudoscientific and his claims as false.  Claims by the inventor  By adding rolls to the armature of a motor, a larger and larger counter-electromotive force is generated on the motor. Newman outlined his claims about there being a fundamental electromagnetic interaction in all matter ultimately derived from only one type of force particle propagating at the speed of light. Newman claims that the motor derives its power by converting some of the mass of the copper in the coils into usable energy, in application of Einstein's mass‚Äìenergy equivalence. According to proponents of the Energy Machine, the most crucial part of the design concerns what happens as a result of mechanical commutation. U.S. patent application In 1979, Newman submitted an application for his device to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The application was eventually rejected in 1983, which set off a lengthy court battle. The United States District Court requested a master of the court to make the final decision. William E. Schuyler, Jr, former Commissioner of U.S. Patent Office, Washington, DC was chosen by the court to make the final decision to award the patent or not award the patent to Newman. Schuyler concluded that evidence to support Newman's claim was overwhelming and found no contradictory factual evidence. However, the judge ordered Newman's machine to be tested by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), by request of the patent office, tested the device for several months and got negative results. In every case presented in the NBS report, the output power was less than power input from the battery pack, and therefore the efficiency was less than 100%. The court therefore upheld the rejection of the patent application. Newman argued that he had been mistreated by the patent office, and tried to have his motor legalized directly by the US Congress. He obtained a hearing on 30 July 1986 in front of several senators, but he was unsuccessful. During the hearing, Newman refused to have the machine tested by independent experts, and senator John Glenn pointed out that his supposedly independent expert actually had a prior business relationship with him. The case is now cited in the USPTO's Manual of Patent Examining Procedure as an example of an \\"inoperative\\" invention that can't have any utility, concretely as a perpetual motion machine. Manual of Patent Examining Procedure Cease and desist order In August 2007 the Alabama Securities Commission issued a cease and desist order to the \\"Newman Energy Corporation\\", alleging it had sold unregistered stock in the company. In January 2008 the company tendered offers of rescission to its nine Alabama investors, offering to reverse the sales. Eight of the investors declined the offer, electing to retain their investment; the ninth did not reply. The company agreed to pay the State of Alabama $7,000 in administrative assessments and investigative costs.

Her proper name was Kich≈ç, but since she came from Mino Province, she is most commonly referred to as N≈çhime (\\"Lady of Mino\\"; N≈ç is an abbreviation for N≈çsh≈´ (ÊøÉÂ∑û), other name of Mino Province, and hime means \\"lady, princess, noblewoman\\"). She was renowned for her beauty and cleverness. N≈çhime's father was the daimyo Sait≈ç D≈çsan and her mother was known as Omi no Kata. N≈ç herself appears very little in any historical record, and there is little information on the dates of her birth or death; however, proposed dates for her birth fall in 1533‚Äì35. According to one historical record, Lady N≈ç was infertile, and when Nobunaga's concubine Lady Kitsuno gave birth to Oda Nobutada, the child was given to Lady N≈ç, Nobunaga's legal wife, to be raised as Nobunaga's heir.  Marriage to Nobunaga  Oda Nobunaga N≈ç was said to be extremely intelligent and stunningly beautiful. At their wedding, Nobunaga described her as having \\"the mind of a genius and the appearance of a goddess.\\" She was married to him in 1549, during a truce between his father, Nobuhide, and hers (Sait≈ç D≈çsan). The marriage is believed to have been a political gesture, with little actual love between N≈ç and Nobunaga. Though she was his official wife, it is often believed that he focused his love on his concubine, Kitsuno, who bore him his first son, Nobutada. N≈ç was never able to conceive a child with Nobunaga, and it was believed that she was infertile. Through lack of historical record there is not much information of what became of N≈ç or even the date of her death. Overall, it can be said that N≈ç's life as it is known now is more of a mixture of legends, folktales, and tentative half-truths. N≈ç's official grave is at S≈çken-in (), a subtemple of Daitoku-ji in Kyoto. Legends and speculation One theory posits that N≈ç was acting as a spy, or even assassin, for her father; at that time it was not an uncommon practice for a wife to relay information to her maiden family. Given Nobunaga's reputation at the time as the unruly \\"Fool of Owari\\" (Owari no Utsuke Â∞æÂºµ„ÅÆËôö„Åë), it was also not impossible for D≈çsan to want N≈ç to assassinate him, as she was skilled in both the sword and a selection of martial arts. As for her alleged role as a spy, there is a popular story where Nobunaga purposely gave N≈ç false information regarding a conspiracy between two of her father's head servants and their plans to betray him. Her father had both men executed, and thus weakened himself by eliminating those loyal to him. Honn≈ç-ji burning (N≈çhime fought with a naginata in the center right.) In 1556, N≈ç's father, was killed in a coup done by his own son, Yoshitatsu, in Mino Province. This detracted much from N≈ç's worth as a wife. Her inability to conceive and her supposed spying were held against her. = Incident at Honn≈ç-ji = The fate of N≈çhime is uncertain, but it is said that she died in the flames of Honno-ji while fighting with her naginata against enemy soldiers. However it is said that she managed to survive the battle and escaped the flames of Kyoto alive. After the Honn≈ç-ji Incident which claimed the lives of Nobunaga and his son Nobutada, it was uncertain where N≈ç went. Some speculate that she died at Honn≈ç-ji, but the woman alleged to be N≈ç was more often believed to be a dormant prostitute who Oda Nobunaga had taken a liking to. Nevertheless, after the incident, Nobunaga's wives and female servants were all sent to Azuchi Castle, which was Nobunaga's castle of residence. Among the women was a Lady Azuchi (ÂÆâÂúüÊÆø Azuchi dono), who was taken in by Nobunaga's second son, Nobukatsu. This Lady Azuchi is widely believed to have been N≈ç in disguise as she soon after disappeared from Azuchi Castle in the night. = Other survival theory = Afterwards, it was often rumoured that she had attempted to raise her father's clan in Mino under her name. But this rumour also says that N≈ç had been killed by an assassin sent by the Akechi who had been tracking her down since her escape from Honn≈ç-ji. The most commonly accepted form of N≈ç‚Äôs life after the death of Nobunaga is that she was under the care of her adopted son Nobukatsu until he was defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, then was under the care of the Toyotomi until her death in 1612.  In fiction  In Sengoku Basara game and anime series, she is depicted as a beautiful and elegant woman who is loyal to her husband, with matchlock pistols, jackhammers and guns as weapons. In the game Nioh she appears as Yuki-Onna. (In Japanese folklore, Yuki-Onna is a spirit of snow, associated with disappearing children). In Nioh, she was resurrected by the main antagonist and was killed in one-on-one battle with the main protagonist after he is dispatched to Honn≈ç-ji temple to solve mystery behind the snow that appeared out of nowhere in middle of June. In the fight, she uses ice magic and naginata made out of ice.

They released two albums, a self-titled album in 1998, and a follow-up, Progress, in 2000. The band disbanded shortly after the release of Progress in 2001 due to being dropped by their label due to poor sales of both albums. History =Formation (1995-1996)= The band was formed soon after the breakup of the band Indica, which contained three of the five original Ultraspank members; Tyler Clark, Dan Ogden, and Pete Murray, not to be confused with Australian singer Pete Murray. The three of them want to continue making music together, they wanted to change their sound, so they enlisted the help of Neil Godfrey, and eventually Jerry Oliveria, a bandmate of his in a previous band named \\"Good Mourning\\". They originally formed the band as \\"Spank\\", but due to legal reasons they were forced to change it. Rob Zombie suggested they should call themselves Ultraspank, and the band ended up taking his suggestion. =Self- titled (1997-1999)= In 1997, the band signed to Epic Records. The band decided to go with this label due to them being famous at the time for previously breaking other heavy bands such as Korn and Rage Against the Machine into mainstream popularity. Their debut, self-titled album was released on March 31, 1998. While the president of the company at the time of their signing fully supported the band, he was shortly afterwards fired, and the band received less support from the new president. Despite the lack of support, the band still toured tirelessly for two years, mostly on their own support, even using their own tour van, which racked up over 100,000 miles during the time. The band became demoralized with all the work being put into without any backing from the label. However, the band received another break. They were able to get one of their songs, \\"Five\\", on the PlayStation video game 3Xtreme. This brought the band a ton of exposure, as it was quoted as selling \\"400,000 units\\" and \\"far more than their first album sold\\". This brought them more support from Epic, so the band started work on a follow-up album. =Progress (2000-2001)= After the heavy touring in support of their first album, the band returned to the studio for their followup Progress. Sonically, vocalist described the goal of the album was that he \\"wanted to go further out on the melodic tip. As a band, our groove is one of the things we pride ourselves on the most, but there's a lot more melody on this record. It's not happy melody, but it's still emotional music.\\" The name of the album represented a number of things for the band. Jerry Oliviera expanded on this in an interview, saying it's \\"...a statement on where we're heading together as a society. The cover is a real photo, from a genetic engineering project, of a mouse with a human ear growing out of its back. It's supposed to be like, 'we're growing ears out of animals' backs. Yeah, that's progress.'\\". The album name also represented the album's matured sound in comparison to the first, in its using of acoustic guitar, and using programming more to their advantage. Murray claims that the recording sessions were so intense, that there were many times where he or Godfrey would need to leave for a break, and that the album can still be hard for them to listen to on an emotional level. Progress was released on May 30, 2000, but didn't sell very well, yet again due to a lack of promotion. As a result, the band was dropped by their record label, leading to a breakup. =Post-breakup (2002-present)= After the break up, Murray took some time away from music, while Godfrey joined downthesun and Motograter for a short period. After leaving those bands, he went on to form Lo-Pro with former vocalist Murray in 2002. The band has released two albums, a self-titled release in 2003 and The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge in 2010, and the band is still presently together. In 2008, rumors arose about the band reuniting. However, things had been taken out of context, as what was being referenced to was the fact that guitarist Oliviera was joining Lo-Pro as a replacement bassist, making it so now Lo-Pro had three Ultraspank members in the band. The \\"reuniting\\" was the fact that Murray, Godrey, and Oliviera all played on Lo-Pro's 2010 release The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge as they had in both Ultraspank releases.

The band was one of the first to mix punk rock with surf music. History The power trio's original lineup was Mike Palm on guitar and vocals, Steve Soto on bass, and Scott Miller on drums. They first gained attention for their song \\"Bloodstains,\\" originally appearing on their self- released debut 7\\" EP in 1980. A demo version of the song was given to Rodney Bingenheimer, a DJ at Pasadena radio station KROQ-FM, who placed it on his seminal 1980 compilation album, Rodney on the ROQ, on Posh Boy Records. With James Levesque on bass (replacing Soto, who left to form the Adolescents), the group recorded their debut Living In Darkness album with Brian Elliot, best known for composing Madonna‚Äôs hit \\"Papa Don‚Äôt Preach.\\" The record was released by Posh Boy in November 1981 and included another, newer version of \\"Bloodstains\\" (later used in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4). A 12\\" EP, Bitchin' Summer, followed in 1982 on Posh Boy. Signing to Enigma Records, the band released another 12\\" EP, 1983's When You Least Expect It..., followed by a second album, This Is the Voice, released in 1986. In 1988, former Social Distortion bassist Brent Liles replaced Levesque, and the following year, Derek O'Brien (also a former member of Social Distortion as well as D.I.) replaced Miller on drums. In 1991, Restless Records released the Real Live Sound live album, recorded at The Roxy in Hollywood on July 21, 1990. It was the only Agent Orange recording to feature the Palm/Liles/O'Brien lineup. Sam Bolle replaced Liles in January 1992, remaining with the band until May 2003, when he left to join Dick Dale's band. A third studio album, Virtually Indestructible, was released in 1996 on the Gunka Disc label. The album featured drummer Charlie Quintana, formerly of the Plugz and later of Social Distortion. Greatest & Latest ‚Äì This, That-N-The Other Thing a compilation of rerecorded older material and new songs, was released in 2000 on Cleopatra Records, and featured Bolle on bass and Steve Latanation on drums. Latanation as well as Dusty Watson alternately played drums through 2008. In 2006, Perry Giordano joined on bass. In 2009, the band added drummer Dave Klein, who had previously recorded with numerous bands including the Bomboras, Ghastly Ones and the Seeds/Sky Saxon. Former bassist Liles died on January 18, 2007, and former bassist Levesque died on October 19, 2014. Founding member and former bassist Steve Soto died on June 27, 2018. = In film, television, and games = The Agent Orange tracks \\"Too Young To Die,\\" \\"Everything Turns Grey,\\" \\"A Cry For Help In A World Gone Mad\\" and \\"Bloodstains\\" were used in the 1987 21 Jump Street episode, \\"Mean Streets And Pastel Houses.\\" \\"Fire in the Rain\\", \\"Bite the Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"So Strange\\" were used for the 1990 horror film Pale Blood, which also featured live performances by the band. \\"Fire in the Rain\\" was featured in the 1986 film River's Edge. \\"Everything Turns Grey\\" was used in the 2001 comedy film Freddy Got Fingered. \\"Bloodstains\\" was used for the soundtrack in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, and subsequently in EA's Skate 3. \\"No Such Thing\\" was used in the 2007 video game Skate. \\"Too Young to Die\\" was used in the pilot episode of Deadly Class. \\"Let It Burn\\" was featured in the video game, Evolution Skateboarding. \\"Bored Of You\\" was featured on the punk radio station Channel X on Grand Theft Auto V.

Aggregate expenditure is defined as the current value of all the finished goods and services in the economy. The aggregate expenditure is thus the sum total of all the expenditures undertaken in the economy by the factors during a given time period. It is the expenditure incurred on consumer goods, planned investment and the expenditure made by the government in the economy. In an open economy scenario, aggregate expenditure also includes the difference between the exports and the imports. Aggregate expenditures is defined as AE=C+I_p+G+N_X * C = Household Consumption * I_p = Planned Investment * G = Government spending * N_X = Net exports (Exports ‚àí Imports) Aggregate expenditure provides one way to calculate the sum total of all economic activity in an economy, which is referred to as the gross domestic product of an economy. The gross domestic product is calculated through the aggregate expenditure model, also known as the Keynesian cross. AE is also used in the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model which advances the aggregate expenditures model with the inclusion of price changes. Aggregate demand (AD) refers to the sum total of goods that are demanded in an economy over a period and thus AD is defined by the planned total expenditure in an economy for a given price level. Components Various schools of thoughts use various components to come up with the Aggregate Expenditure. The major schools of economic thought, which are the classical and Keynesian economists, use the following components: ;Consumption Consumption is the household consumption over a given period of time. The total household consumption can be divided into two parts: Autonomous Consumption and Induced consumption. Autonomous Consumption is the amount of consumption regardless of the amount of income; hence, even if income is zero, the autonomous consumption would be the total consumption. Induced consumption refers to the level of consumption dependent on the level of income. ;Investment Investment is the amount of expenditure on capital goods. Investment is the expenditure on goods that are expected to yield a return or increase their own value over time. Investment expenditure can be further divided into two parts, planned investment and unplanned investment. Over the long run the sum of differences in the unplanned investment would equal zero as economy approaches equilibrium. ;Government Expenditure The Keynesian model propagates an active state to control and regulate the economy. The government can make expenditure in terms of infrastructure, and thus increase the total expenditure in the economy as advocated by Keynes. Transfer payments (such as pensions and unemployment benefits) are not included in G as that would mean a double count. ;Net Exports In an open economy, the total expenditure in the economy also includes the components of net exports, which is total exports minus total imports. *Income (Y)''' Income is the sum of the various components wage income, profit income, and rental income. Classical economics Classical economists relied on Say's law, which states that supply creates its own demand, which stemmed from the belief that wages, prices, and interest rates are all flexible. This comes from the classical thought that the factor payments which are made to the various factors of production during the production process would create enough income in the economy to create a demand for the products produced. This revolves around Adam Smith's invisible hand, which states that the markets would achieve equilibrium via the market forces that impact economic activity and thus there is no need for government intervention. Moreover, the classical economists believed that the economy was operating at a full employment. Classical economics has been criticized for its assumptions that the economy works at a full-employment equilibrium which is empirically false, since the economy often operates at an under-employment equilibrium mainly because of \\"sticky\\" wages, which in turn provides the foundation for the Keynesian model of aggregate expenditure. Keynesian economics Keynesian economics believes, contrary to classical thought, that wages, prices and interest rates are not flexible and hence violate Say's law, which provided the foundation for the maxim that \\"supply creates its own demand\\". Keynes believed that the economy was subject to sticky prices and thus the economy was not in a state of perpetual equilibrium and also operated at an under- employment equilibrium. Keynesian economics calls for government intervention and is called demand-side economics as it believes that aggregate demand and not aggregate supply determines the GDP because of the difference between the aggregate supply and planned expenditure in an economy. Hence Keynes believed that the government played an important role in the determination on the aggregate expenditure in an economy and thus included government expenditure in the aggregate expenditure function. Keynesian economics preaches that in times of a recession, the government must undertake increased expenditure to compensate for the insufficiency in household expenditure and private investment, so as to ensure that sufficient demand is maintained in the goods market. This also leads to the Keynesian multiplier which suggests that every dollar spent on investment or government creates a multiplier effect and leads to an increased expenditure of more than one dollar. Aggregate supply effect of increase in expenditure An economy is said to be in equilibrium when aggregate expenditure is equal to aggregate supply (production) in the economy. According to Keynes, the economy does not stay in a perpetual state of equilibrium but aggregate expenditure and aggregate supply adjust each other towards equilibrium. When there is an excess supply over expenditure, and hence over demand, there is an inventory leftover with the producers, which leads to a reduction in either the prices or the quantity of output and hence reducing the total output (GDP) of the economy. On the other hand, if there is an excess of expenditure over supply, then there is excess demand leading to an increase in prices or output. Hence the economy constantly keeps shifting between excess supply (inventory) and excess demand. Thus, the economy is constantly moving towards an equilibrium between aggregate expenditure and aggregate supply. In an under-employment equilibrium the Keynesian cross refers to the point of intersection of the aggregate supply and the aggregate expenditure curve. A rise in expenditure by either Consumption, Investment or the Government or an increase in exports or a decrease in imports leads to a rise in the aggregate expenditure and thus pushes the economy towards a higher equilibrium and thus reaching a higher level towards the potential GDP.

History The history of the college starts in 1940, when Tallinn Secondary School No. 7 was created by merging Tallinn French School and Jakob Westholm Grammar School. The school was located in the building on Hariduse Street erected for the French Lyceum in 1937. Its name returned to Jakob Westholm Grammar School in 1941 under the German occupation authorities, but its original name was lost again in 1944 when the Soviet occupation was restored. The students had to survive more mergers with other schools. Finally the college became one of the few elite schools specializing in English in Soviet-occupied Estonia. In 1996 the school was renamed to Tallinn English College and moved to its current location on Estonia Puiestee in the very heart of Tallinn. 10.Tallinn English College - History Notable alumni *Yoko Alender, architect *Jim Ashilevi, writer *Kaja Kallas, politician *Anu Lamp, actress *Rein Lang, Minister of Culture *Maria Listra, soprano * Mihkel Raud, singer, guitarist and journalist * Meeli S√∂√∂t, actress References External links * Schools in Tallinn Educational institutions established in 1940 1940 establishments in Estonia ","title":"Tallinn English College"},{"id":"1770024","text":"Quick clay, also known as Leda clay and Champlain Sea clay in Canada, is any of several distinctively sensitive glaciomarine clays found in Canada, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Finland, the United States and other locations around the world. The clay is so unstable that when a mass of quick clay is subjected to sufficient stress, the material behavior may drastically change from that of a particulate material to that of a watery fluid. Quick clay has a remolded strength which is much less than its strength upon initial loading. This is caused by its highly unstable clay particle structure. Quick clay is typically originally deposited in a marine environment. In that environment, the positive charge of cations (such as Na+) was able to bind clay particles with negative surface charge (typically silicates ) by balancing charge in the double layer. When the clay became uplifted and was no longer subjected to salt water conditions, rainwater infiltrated these clays and washed away the salts that allowed these clay particles to remain in a stable structure. With shear stress, the lack of counterbalancing charge from salts in the quick clay results in clay particle repulsion and realignment of clay particles to a structure that is extremely weak and unstable. Quick clay regains strength rapidly when salt is added, which allows clay particles to form complexes with one another. Quick clay is found only in northern countries, such as Russia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and in Alaska, United States since they were glaciated during the Pleistocene epoch. In Canada, the clay is associated primarily with the Pleistocene-era Champlain Sea, in the modern Ottawa Valley, the St. Lawrence Valley, and the Saguenay River regions. Quick clay has been the underlying cause of many deadly landslides. In Canada alone, it has been associated with more than 250 mapped landslides. Some of these are ancient, and may have been triggered by earthquakes. Formation of quick clay At the height of the past glaciation (about 20,000 years ago), the land was 'pushed' down by the weight of the ice (isostatic depression). All of the ground-up rock was deposited in the surrounding ocean, which had penetrated significantly inland. The loose deposition of the silt and clay particles in the marine environment, allowed an unusual flocculation to take place. Essentially, this formed a strongly bonded soil skeleton, which was 'glued' by highly mobile sea-salt ions. At this point, there was only the formation of very strong marine clay, which is found all over the world and highly stable, but with its own unique geotechnical problems. When the glaciers retreated, the land mass rose (post-glacial rebound), the clay was exposed, and formed the soil mass for new vegetation. The rainwater in these northern countries was quite aggressive to these clays, perhaps because it was softer (containing less calcium), or the higher silt content allowed more rainwater and snowmelt to penetrate. The final result was that the ionic 'glue' of the clay was weakened, to give a weak, loose soil skeleton, enclosing significant amounts of water (high sensitivity with high moisture content). Quick clay deposits are rarely located directly at the ground surface, but are typically covered by a normal layer of topsoil. While this topsoil can absorb most normal stresses, such as normal rainfall or a modest earth tremor, a shock that exceeds the capacity of the topsoil layer ‚Äî such as a larger earthquake, a large mass added near a slope, or an abnormal rainfall which leaves the topsoil fully saturated so that additional water has nowhere to permeate except into the clay ‚Äî can disturb the clay and initiate the process of liquefaction. Incidents Because the clay layer is typically covered with topsoil, a location which is vulnerable to a quick clay landslide is usually identifiable only by soil testing, and is rarely obvious to a casual observer. Thus human settlements and transportation links have often been built on or near clay deposits, resulting in a number of notable catastrophes: *In 1702, a landslide destroyed almost all traces of the medieval town Sarpsborg. 15 people and 200 animals were killed. *On 19 May 1893, a landslide in Verdal, Norway, killed 116 people and destroyed 105 farms. It left a crater several kilometers in diameter. *The most disastrous such landslide to affect North America occurred in 1908, when a slide into the frozen Du Li√®vre River propelled a wave of ice-filled water into Notre-Dame-de-la-Salette, Quebec causing the loss of 33 lives and the destruction of 12 homes. *In 1955, a landslide affected part of the downtown of Nicolet, Quebec, causing $10 million in damages. *On May 4, 1971, 31 lives were lost when 40 homes were swallowed in a retrogressive flowslide in Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec, resulting in the relocation of the entire town when the government declared the area uninhabitable due to the presence of Leda clay. *The experience of Saint-Jean-Vianney contributed to the abandonment of the town of Lemieux, Ontario in 1991, after a 1989 study showed it was also located on the same type of clay along the South Nation River. In 1993, those findings were borne out when the town's abandoned main street was swallowed by a massive 17 hectare landslide. *Another famous flow of quick clay at Rissa, Norway, in 1978 caused about 33 hectares (82 acres) of farmland to liquefy and flow into the lake Botn over a few hours, with the loss of one life. The Rissa slide was well recorded by local citizens and a documentary film was made about it in 1981.BFI  Film & TV Database  The RISSA LANDSLIDE (1981) *On May 11, 2010, quick clay took the lives of a family living in Saint-Jude, Quebec, when the land their house was built on suddenly tumbled down toward the Salvail River. The landslide was so sudden that the family members died where they sat; they had been watching an ice hockey game on television.\\"Family dead in basement after sinkhole ate home\\". CNN, May 12, 2010. The slide took out a portion of rural road which took a year to reinstate.Article, TVA, July 13, 2011 *On 2 February 2015, a landslide collapsed a pillar on the Skjeggestad Bridge. The landslide was caused by nearby earthworks. *On June 3, 2020 eight buildings were swept into the sea by a landslide in Kr√•kneset in the Alta municipality in Norway. The landslide was filmed by a resident. There were no casualties, and a dog was rescued from the sea. Eight buildings swept into the sea by landslides in Alta These landslides are retrogressive, meaning they usually start at water, and progress upwards at slow walking speed, although particularly deep quick clay layers on sloped regions may collapse much more rapidly, or in very large chunks that can slide at great speed due to the liquid nature of the disturbed clay. They have been known to penetrate kilometers inland, and consume everything in their path. In modern times, areas known to have quick clay deposits are commonly tested in advance of any major human development. It is not always possible to entirely avoid building on a quick clay site, although modern engineering techniques have found technical precautions which can be taken to mitigate the risk of disaster. For example, when Ontario's Highway 416 had to pass through a quick clay deposit near Nepean, lighter fill materials such as polystyrene were used for the road bed, vertical wick drains were inserted along the route and groundwater cutoff walls were built under the highway to limit water infiltration into the clay.\\"Conquering the Leda clay\\" , Ontario Ministry of Transportation.

He was one of the first African-American entertainers to cross over into the mainstream. Daniels was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1977. Life and career = Early life = Daniels was born in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. where his father was a postmaster and notary. His mother was a schoolteacher and organist. Daniels had a heritage of Portuguese sailor, Native American (Choctaw), African American, and frontiersman Daniel Boone. = Early career = In 1935, Daniels moved from Jacksonville to New York to attend Columbia University. He planned to become a lawyer, but he was sidetracked during the Depression. His grandmother was a seamstress in Harlem for the Ziegfeld Follies, and she encouraged her grandson to sing at Dickie Wells, the club where he first worked as a dishwasher, then a singing waiter. There he was discovered by bandleader Erskine Hawkins, who hired him as a featured vocalist. He toured with the Erskine Hawkins Band in 1935‚Äì36 and then returned to Harlem. Throughout 1938, he sang daily on New York radio for 12 different sponsors. \\"It was me or the horse racing,\\" Daniels remarked. Daniels performed frequently at nightclubs on New York's 52nd Street, where he was one of the first singers to leave the big-band scene and pursue a solo career. He sometimes made three 52nd Street club performances per night. In 1945, he played intermission with Charlie Parker at the Spotlite Club on 52nd Street. Daniels had several accompanists, including Nat Cole, while in New York. In 1948, he teamed with ex-big-band pianist Benny Payne, who had been Cab Calloway's pianist in the Cotton Club. Payne remained as accompanist for the rest of Daniel's career. =\\"That Old Black Magic\\"= alt= Daniels' first trademark song from his time on New York radio was the song \\"Diane,\\" which he recorded on Bluebird in 1941. His later signature song was \\"That Old Black Magic\\", by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer, which Daniels first recorded for Apollo Records in 1948. His 1950 recording on Mercury became a hit, selling in the millions. His sensational performance in 1950 in Bill Miller's Riveria Club led to holdover appearances. Following Park Avenue residences, Daniels record holdover at 1952 New York Copacabana Club still stands. Daniels was popular in Europe after he headlined at the London Palladium in 1952, having broken the house records. He toured the UK's Moss Theatre circuit in the 1950s as \\"America's most exciting singer.\\" His forte was as a nightclub entertainer, and he was the biggest cabaret draw in New York throughout the 1950s, appearing alongside the comedian Jimmy Durante. His vocal stylings and trademark dance movements were widely imitated by the impressionists of the era. In 1958, Daniels was the first entertainer to sign a longterm contract to appear in Las Vegas for three years at the Stardust. =Broadway= Daniels had performed in musicals on Broadway early in his career with a minor role in a short-lived musical, Memphis Bound (1945). More notable was the long run (700+ performances) of Golden Boy with Sammy Davis Jr. in 1964, directed by Arthur Penn. Daniels toured the US in 1975 with Pearl Bailey in the all-black Hello, Dolly!, and in London's West End, he headlined a 1978 presentation of Bubbling Brown Sugar. He was popular in Australia where he first toured with the Andrews Sisters in 1954. =Films and television= Daniels was a pioneer in the new medium of television with his own television series on ABC in 1952. The Billy Daniels Show was sponsored by Rybutol, a popular vitamin tablet at the time. This 15-minute show, telecast from New York on Sunday evenings from what was later to become The Ed Sullivan Theater (and now The Late Show) was a milestone: the first sponsored network television series starring a black performer. He appeared on television in the US and UK and Australia and Canada throughout the 1950s and 1960s with performances on The Milton Berle Show and 'The Ed Sullivan Show. His films include When You're Smiling (Columbia, 1950) On the Sunny Side of the Street (Columbia 1951) and Columbia's Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder (Columbia, 1952). In the original script for the movie Goodfellas (working title: \\"Wiseguys\\") the narration of the character Karen Hill was to include, \\"One night, Billy Daniels sent us champagne. There was nothing like it.\\" However, in the final version of the movie, the name was changed to Bobby Vinton. = Later recording career = Daniels' recordings cover the period of transition from 78-rpm to the dawn of microgroove recording. Remembered mostly for his charismatic live performances, he made an album at Abbey Road, The Magic of Billy Daniels (1978), which contained a disco version of \\"That Old Black Magic.\\" He recorded one of the first soul records, \\"Woe Woe Woe\\", a now rare recording. Personal life alt= = Marriage and children = Daniels was married four times: Gladys Gordan (divorced 1940); Florence Clotworthy (died 1947); Martha Braun (divorced 1953); and Pierrette (from 1955 to his death in 1988). Daniels and Gladys Gordan had one child; Yvonne Daniels. He had three children with his second wife Florence Clotworthy; Diane, Billy Jr, Bruce. Clotworthy died in 1947. In 1950, Daniels married socialite Martha Braun. Braun filed for divorce in Juarez, Mexico, citing mental cruelty. He did not contest the action. After the divorce Daniels married Pierette Cameron, whom he hired as governess for his children. Pierrette had two daughters with Daniels; Andrea and Dominique. Pierrette H. Daniels, Daniels' widow (deceased 2011), and their daughter Dominique Daniels founded a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, the Billy Daniels Foundation, raising money for under served youths seeking Arts Education support in her late husband's name. Dominique Daniels, is Chief Executive Officer of the Billy Daniels Foundation. = Health = Daniels had heart-bypass surgery twice, first in 1982 and then five years later in 1987.  Death  Daniels died on October 7, 1988, from stomach cancer at the age of 73 in Los Angeles, California. He is buried at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego, California.

He is the founder of both the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies in Cairo and the Arab Organization for Human Rights. He is married to Barbara Lethem Ibrahim. Barbara Ibrahim is the director of the Gerhart Center for Civic Engagement and Philanthropy in Cairo. The Ibrahims have two children, Randa and Amir Ibrahim. Randa has two kids Lara and Seif, and Amir has Adam and Gebriel. Well before his confrontations with the Egyptian government in the early 2000s, Ibrahim had become a controversial figure in Egypt. He reversed his earlier criticism of Anwar Sadat for his peace initiative with Israel. He gained the respect of Egypt's human rights and civil society community for championing different causes, including Copts, Bah√° º√≠s. and other minorities at a time of rising sectarian tensions. Ibrahim was arrested, imprisoned and prosecuted in 2000 for using European Union funds for election monitoring, and for allegedly defaming Egypt's image abroad. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. His defense team countered that the real motives behind the government's prosecution of Ibrahim and his assistants was his outspoken criticism of President Hosni Mubarak and his administration. He was tried twice on the same charges in State Security Courts, winning each time on appeal. During a third trial before the highest civil court in 2003, he was cleared of all charges and released, but not before a storm of international protest had put the Mubarak regime on the defensive. As an independent-minded intellectual, Ibrahim has supported fair elections when they were viewed as incompatible with Egyptian politics, promoted international democratic alliances, and accepted NGO funding from any source that shares peaceful and democratic values, including those in the US. He has recently been under attack in the official press for calling on the U.S. Congress to condition its military aid to Egypt on improvements in the country's human rights record and the freeing of another political prisoner, Ayman Nour.Al-Ahram Weekly, June 21, 2007 In 2006 Ibrahim was awarded the Ion Ratiu Democracy Lecture Prize at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, where he previously had been a public policy scholar. He is currently a Board member of the Arab Democracy Foundation. Ibrahim taught sociology at Indiana's DePauw University from 1967 to 1974. During the academic year 2008-2009, Ibrahim lived in the United States as a professor of political sociology at Indiana University. and a visiting fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Harvard University. Ibrahim is currently the Wallerstein Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Drew University Center on Religion, Culture & Conflict in Madison, New Jersey. Sentence On 2 August 2008, an Egyptian court sentenced Ibrahim to two years of prison for 'defaming Egypt'. He was granted a bail of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (US$1,890) and his lawyer expressed his will to appeal. It is reported that Ibrahim is currently in exile outside of Egypt, to avoid probable arrest upon his return. Sources close to Ibrahim reported that he also feared assassination upon his return to Egypt. Despite these concerns, however, on Wednesday, August 5, 2010 Ibrahim returned to Cairo for a visit with his family. He was greeted warmly by friends, family and supporters at Cairo Airport. In view of persistent reports of the failing health of Hosni Mubarak, growing tensions over presidential succession in Egypt and then upcoming October, 2010 elections for the Maglis al-Sha'ab (People's Assembly), supporters of Ibrahim were concerned about his safety. As of summer 2012 Ibrahim was living in Cairo and running the Ibn Khaldun Center.

The on-sale bar of 35 U.S.C. 102(b) is triggered if the invention is both # the subject of a commercial offer for sale not primarily for experimental purposes and # ready for patenting. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1646-47 (1998). Ready for patenting means either that the invention was reduced to practice or that enabling disclosures existed. Traditional contract law principles are applied when determining whether a commercial offer for sale has occurred. See Linear Tech. Corp. v. Micrel, Inc., 275 F.3d 1040, 1048, 61 USPQ2d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001), petition for cert. filed, 71 USLW 3093 (Jul. 03, 2002) (No. 02-39); Group One, Ltd. v.

Cir. 2001) (\\"As a general proposition, we will look to the Uniform Commercial Code ('UCC') to define whether a communication or series of communications rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale.\\"). The on-sale bar is an extraordinarily (some would argue needlessly) complex body of patent law in all but the simplest cases. For instance, licenses are normally not considered a sale, even when a sample product is transferred as part of the license, but a computer software license is considered a barring sale even if the patent claims are method claims. The normal standard of reduction to practice (which requires recognizing the invention) has been ignored in several cases, for example an offer for sale of a waste disposal machine which, if accepted would have practiced a later invention due to the special nature of the waste, was considered a barring sale even though the invention had not even been conceived yet and the sale did not take place. There is no joint-development exception to the on-sale bar, meaning that the on-sale bar in many cases is triggered when the invention is \\"ready for patenting,\\" which can occur when an inventor is working alone at a drafting table. The ready-for-patenting standard is judged retrospectively in an adversarial setting, so even if an invention was far too premature to have been put into a patent application, with details missing, it may still be deemed to have been \\"ready for patenting.\\" Moreover, an inadequate disclosure cannot provide priority for a continuation-in-part application, so an inventor who fears the on-sale bar and files a premature patent application may not be able to rescue it later.

Using AFP, users can control formatting, the form of paper output, whether a document is to be printed or viewed online, and manage document storage and access in a distributed network across multiple operating system platforms. AFP is primarily used in large enterprises for production variable data printing (VDP). AFP applications allow users or print room operators to distribute print jobs among a group of printers and to designate backup printers when one fails. AFP is considered to be a \\"cornerstone\\" of electronic document management (EDM) applications such as print-and-view, archive and retrieval, and enterprise report management (ERM). History AFP was originally developed by IBM as a general purpose document and information presentation architecture, originally called Advanced Function Printing. The first specifications and products go back to 1984. The major concepts of object-driven structures, print integrity, resource management, and support for high print speeds have been preserved ever since. In October 2004 IBM initiated the formation of the AFP Color Consortium (AFPCC). The purpose was to collaboratively develop color management support in the AFP architecture. This resulted in the creation of the new AFP CMOCA (Color Management Object Content Architecture) specification, which was first published in 2006. In May 2006 IBM announced plans to open up the complete scope of the AFP architecture to the consortium. This new initiative was finalized in September 2006 and is now called simply the AFP Consortium (AFPC). In June 2007, IBM's role as founding member of the AFPC was transferred to InfoPrint Solutions Company, an IBM - Ricoh joint venture, and later to Ricoh. In February 2009 the AFPC was incorporated under a new set of bylaws with tiered membership and shared governance resulting in the creation of a formal open standards body called AFP Consortium Inc. Total membership has grown to over 35 companies and includes members from all parts of the document-processing industry. More information on the AFPC can be found at the AFPC Consortium. Components The AFP architecture consists of a number of sub-architectures: * MO:DCA-P (Mixed Object:Document Content Architecture-Presentation), the Page Description Language file format that describes the text and graphics on a page. The 'Mixed Object' moniker refers to the fact that a MO:DCA file can contain multiple types of objects, including text, images, vector graphics, and even objects marked as 'barcodes'. An application can simply include a string of digits along with controls that identify a specific type of barcode, and the rendering of bars will be done on the output platform (physical printer hardware or software emulation). A MO:DCA file consists of a sequential, ordered hierarchy of independent objects - documents, pages, data objects, and resource objects such as fonts and ICC profiles. Each object is delimited by begin/end structures, and objects to be rendered specify presentation parameters and resource requirements in structures called \\"environment groups\\". Since the pages in MO:DCA documents appear in sequential order, presentation can start as soon as the first page is received. The MO:DCA format is comparable to other PDLs that specify distinct pages such as PDF. MO:DCA-P is sometimes called AFPDS (AFP Data Stream). * IPDS Intelligent Printer Data Stream. This is the bi-directional protocol used between the host server and the printer. It is used to send the page-level data to the printer and to signal errors and accounting information back to the server. The IPDS protocol also allows the server to query a printer's available resources (e.g. available memory, fonts, input trays, etc.). It is comparable to protocols like Internet Printing Protocol. * Bar Code Object Content Architecture (BCOCA), which is used to describe and generate bar codes. * Color Management Object Content Architecture (CMOCA), which defines resources that carry color management information, such as ICC profiles, tone transfer curves, and halftones. * Graphics Object Content Architecture for AFP (AFP GOCA), which is used to define and generate vector graphics. * Image Object Content Architecture (IOCA), which is used to define and generate raster images. * Presentation Text Object Content Architecture (PTOCA), which is used to define and generate text. Specifications defining all of the AFP sub-architectures can be found at the AFP Consortium. AFP also supports other industry-standard data formats using the concept of AFP object containers; examples are TIFF, GIF, JPEG (JFIF), EPS, and PDF. These objects can be mixed as peer objects on an AFP page with native AFP objects such as BCOCA, AFP GOCA, IOCA, and PTOCA objects. Print modes \\"AFP can be printed 'offline', using the AFPDS format converted on the fly\\" into another page description language. It can also \\"be printed 'online' through various software like PSF (Print Service Facility) on an IBM system or through a spooler like S2P, IPM... creating IPDS on the fly.\\" IBM implementation The original tool to produce AFP output and to drive the IBM printers was Print Service Facility (PSF), which is still in use on IBM mainframes today. It formats the input data to be printed based on definitions on how to place the data on the page, called PAGEDEF and FORMDEF. This service also allowed the definition of electronic forms, named OVERLAYS. PSF is not only able to format the documents, but also to drive AFP or, more precisely, IPDS printers. IPDS stands for Intelligent Print Data Stream. It is a bidirectional format where the software is constantly in control of the printer and knows at all times the status of the pages sent to the printer, making it convenient for high volume production printers, that print 100 pages or more within a minute. IBM also offered the PSF software not only on the mainframe, but on all of their platforms, so there were PSF/390 (for the OS/390 mainframe), PSF/VSE (for IBM VSE/ESA based systems), PSF/6000 (for the RS/6000 AIX9), PSF/400 (for the AS/400, now System i) and PSF/2 running under OS/2. Unfortunately, all of these behaved slightly differently, and IBM renamed PSF then into InfoPrint Manager (IPM). Included with the PSF tools is the ACIF (AFP Conversion and Indexing Facility) that allows one to produce the AFP documents as a file in order to keep them and print them later, as well as adding an index to the document, very similar to Bookmarks in PDF, used for archiving purposes. AFP was designed to make efficient use of storage, which is why it is still a popular format to manage high volumes of documents, such as in banking, telecommunication and insurance companies. The format originates from the MVS environment, so it typically uses the EBCDIC based codepages. As with all page description languages (like PostScript, PDF, and PCL), it is necessary to use a viewer to display documents. One of the more notable features of AFP printers is that output data can be placed at any addressable point on a page. This capability is called all points addressability (APA). APA gives AFP applications the freedom to create output anywhere on a page, as opposed to being limited to just line and character positions.

She was a companion of the Eighth Doctor. Character history Fey is a native of Earth in the early 20th century. She first appeared in the comic strip story Tooth and Claw, published in DWM #257-#260, written by Alan Barnes and drawn by Martin Geraghty and Robin Smith. In 1939, Fey was an undercover operative working for the British government, and had previously encountered the Doctor in an unpublished adventure involving psychic weasels in Russell Square. The Doctor had given her a Stattenheim Summoner ‚Äî a device disguised as a tin whistle that could contact the TARDIS ‚Äî and Fey called on the Doctor and his companion Izzy to help her investigate the sinister Varney. Varney had been taking many to his private island to wait out the coming war in safety; however the question was what exactly happened to Varney's guests. It was here Fey met Izzy Sinclair, another friend of the Doctor. The events of Tooth and Claw proved costly for the Doctor. Although they ultimately defeated Varney, the Doctor had injected himself with a deadly bacillus and was dying. Fey somehow managed to pilot the TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where the Doctor's body was cured and his mind placed into the Matrix to heal. Izzy came along for the trip. While within the Matrix, an attempt was made on the Doctor's life by a secret Time Lord sect known as the Elysians. This was foiled by Shayde, a construct of the Matrix and an old ally of the Doctor's. The assassination attempt was part of a plot by Overseer Luther, an insane Time Lord who wanted to rewrite Gallifrey's history and set himself up as a god. The Doctor managed to thwart Luther by short-circuiting his watchtower (a gigantic TARDIS), but apparently at the cost of his eighth body. As Izzy and Fey watched, the Doctor regenerated into a new incarnation (The Final Chapter, DWM #262-#265). However, this was a ruse. The Doctor had realised that Fey was under external control when she had managed to pilot the TARDIS even though the TARDIS manual was in Gallifreyan script, which she did not understand. Just before the Doctor prepared to sacrifice himself, Shayde offered to take his place and fake a regeneration. This way, the group that was controlling Fey ‚Äî the Threshold, a mercenary organisation that the Doctor had tangled with before ‚Äî would seize the opportunity to bring a newly regenerated and thus weaker Doctor to them. Both disguised with personal chameleon circuits, Shayde would hold their attention while the Doctor sabotaged the Threshold's operations. In a Wild West town on an alien moon run by the Threshold, the Doctor's plans came to fruition. The Threshold removed an implant from Fey, gloating that she had been an unwitting spy for them ever since they kidnapped her in 1937 and placed the device in her head. Preparing for the final confrontation, Shayde and the Doctor revealed themselves to the Threshold. However, Shayde had to contend with the Pariah, an immensely powerful being who was a prototype version of himself. Shayde was unable to defeat the Pariah on his own, and she crushed his skull. Comforting the dying Shayde, Fey merged with the Gallifreyan construct and together they were able to kill the Pariah and eliminate the Threshold. The shared being, dubbed \\"Feyde\\" by the Doctor, although both of them retained their own consciousness, decided to leave and deal with what had just happened to them (Wormwood, DWM #266-#271). Fey returned to 1939, where she continued to work for the British government. Fey spent two years fighting the Nazis with Shayde, frustrated that Shayde would not allow her to use their powers to kill Adolf Hitler, as this would change history. In 1941, she received a sub-ether summons from the Doctor ‚Äî Izzy had been kidnapped, and the Doctor needed Shayde's abilities to track her whereabouts. Together, they succeeded in recovering Izzy, and \\"Feyde\\" returned to World War II after sharing a farewell kiss with Izzy (Oblivion, DWM #323-#328). As a merged entity, Fey is able to share Shayde's powers, including the ability to travel through time and space unaided, phase through solid objects and fire self-generated \\"psychic bullets\\". Fey's penchant for dressing in masculine clothing and her relationship with Izzy implied that she was a lesbian, but her actual orientation was never made explicit, however given certain pieces of dialogue with the Doctor, there is evidence that she is actually bisexual. Fey and Shayde have also developed a love/hate relationship over the course of their unison, Fey telling Shayde things of her own life, but often resents his unswerving loyalty to Rassilon and preserving the web of time. Her initial appearance in Tooth and Claw was inspired by Katharine Hepburn.

The system was set up to support a combination of free trade with the freedom for states to enhance their provision of welfare and to regulate their economies to reduce unemployment. The term was first used by the American political scientist John Ruggie in 1982.Ruggie, John Gerard (1982). \\"International Regimes, Transactions, and Change: Embedded Liberalism in the Postwar Economic Order\\". International Organization 36(2). The term was later used by many international political economy scholars and economic historians, with an early example occurring in Stephen Krasner ed. International Regimes. Mainstream scholars generally describe embedded liberalism as involving a compromise between two desirable but partially conflicting objectives. The first objective was to revive free trade. Before World War I, international trade formed a large portion of global GDP, but the classical liberal order which supported it had been damaged by war and by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The second objective was to allow national governments the freedom to provide generous welfare programmes and to intervene in their economies to maintain full employment.As World War II was drawing to a close, there was more political support for redistributive policies than ever before. The working classes had increased influence due to the recent expansion of the electoral franchise and the wealthier classes were generally more sympathetic due to the shared experience of participating in the war and as moderate Keynesian policies were seen as the best measure to stabilise liberal democracy by reducing poverty and unemployment, thus forestalling the rise of extremists such as fascists. This second objective was considered to be incompatible with a full return to the free market system as it had existed in the late 19th century‚Äîmainly because with a free market in international capital, investors could easily withdraw money from nations that tried to implement interventionist and redistributive policies.This had recently happened to France after the Popular Front came to power in 1936. As Keynes said at the Bretton Woods Conference: \\"Surely in the post-war years there is hardly a country in which we ought not to expect keen political discussions affecting the position of the wealthier classes and the treatment of private property. If so, there will be a number of people constantly taking fright because they think that the degree of leftism in one country looks for the time being likely to be greater than somewhere else\\". Quoted in Helleiner (1995) at p. 35. The resulting compromise was embodied in the Bretton Woods system, which was launched at the end of World War II. The system was liberalThe word liberal has a special meaning here and should not be confused with the modern United States sense of the word which can be associated with left-leaning politics. As is common in most international political economy topics, the word in this article generally means supportive of free trade. in that it aimed to set up an open system of international trade in goods and services, facilitated by semi-fixed exchange rates. Yet it also aimed to embed market forces into a framework where they could be regulated by national governments, with states able to control international capital flows by means of capital controls. New global multilateral institutions were created to support the new framework, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. When Ruggie coined the phrase embedded liberalism, he was building on earlier work by Karl Polanyi, who had introduced the concept of markets becoming disembedded from society during the 19th century. Polanyi went on to propose that the reembedding of markets would be a central task for the architects of the post war world order and this was largely enacted as a result of the Bretton Woods Conference.Though not as a result of Polanyi's direct influence, many others, most notably Keynes, had independently reached parallel conclusions. In the 1950s and 1960s, the global economy prospered under embedded liberalism, with growth more rapid than before or since, yet the system was to break down in the 1970s.  Previous systems  = Embedded markets: all periods up to 1834 = Karl Polanyi argues that until the rise of 19th-century liberalism markets, where they had existed at all, were always and everywhere embedded in society, subject to various social, religious and political controls. The forms of these controls varied widely, for example in India occupations were for centuries determined by caste, rather than market forces. During the Middle Ages, physical markets in Europe were generally heavily regulated, with many towns only permitting larger markets (then known as fayres) to open once or twice a year.In addition to chapter 3‚Äì6 of Polanyi (1944), for a wide-ranging and easily digestible discussion of these restrictions see chapter 1 of The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner. Polanyi explicitly refutes Adam Smith's statement that natural man has a \\"propensity to barter, truck and exchange\\",. arguing that anthropology and economic history shows that until the 19th century markets had only a marginal role in the economy, with by far the most important methods governing the distribution of resources being reciprocal gift giving, centralised redistribution and autarky (self-sufficient households). While Polanyi concedes that European society was beginning to develop towards modern capitalism from as early as the 14th century, especially after the Glorious Revolution and the commencement of the Industrial Revolution, he contends that it was not until 1834 that the establishment of truly free markets became possible. Polyani calls this disembedding of markets from society a \\"singular departure\\"Quoted by Ruggie in the 1982 paper where the term embedded liberalism was coined. from anything that had happened before in human history.. Prior to the 19th century, international trade was very low in proportion to global GDP.. = Classical liberalism: disembedded markets, 1834‚Äì1930s = According to Polanyi, a key event of 1834 which allowed the formation of free markets to take place in Great Britain (the worlds foremost economy at the time) was the abolition of outdoor relief which followed the seizure of political power by the middle classes in 1832.Full abolition of outdoor relief was only completed by the early 1840s, but it was largely accomplished with the 1834 Act. With the unemployed poor unable to get any form of financial help except by entering workhousesThough Polyani notes that a few were still able to receive charity from Lords, Ladies or clergy who offered it in defiance of the Law. and with workhouses made much more oppressive than they had been before, the unemployed would tend to go to any lengths to obtain work, which established a free market in labour. Polanyi concedes that during the 19th century the free market helped deliver unprecedented material progress. He also contends it caused enormous hardship to wide sections of the population as seemingly paradoxically a rapid general increase in prosperity was accompanied by a rapid increase in the number of paupers. To some extent, this phenomenon had been under way in both Europe and Great Britain from the dawn of the Agricultural Revolution, accelerating with the Industrial Revolution in mid-18th century, but it became more acute after 1834.. In both Britain and Europe, labour movements and other forms of resistance arose almost immediately, though they had little sustained effect on mainstream politics until the 1880s. In Britain, although tens of thousands starved to death or were forced into workhouses and prostitution, social unrest was relatively low as on the whole even the working class were quick to benefit from the increasing prosperity. In part, this was due to Britain's early adoption of the free market and her lead in the Industrial Revolution. On continental Europe, unrest erupted in the Protests of 1848, after which Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels launched their Communist Manifesto, although this did not have any great immediate effect. For the most part, from 1834 until the 1870s free market ideology enjoyed almost unchallenged ascendancy in Great Britain and was expanding its influence abroad. In 1848, Lord Macaulay published his The History of England. Though Macaulay was mainly looking back at the 17th century, he also anticipated the enduring triumph of free market liberalism.. By the 1880s, various labour market protections had been enacted, causing Herbert Spencer, at the time perhaps the world's most prominent advocate of economic liberalism, to raise the alarm at the rising power of socialism..Polanyi cites The Man Versus the State (1884) where Spencer provides a long list of what he saw as undesirable state interventions into economic affairs. Polyani goes on to says Spencer was wrong to blame socialism, arguing that the interventions resulted from pragmatic reactions by policy makers to the stresses caused by the free market, thus socialism was not to become a powerful political force until a few decades later. During the late 19th and early 20th century, in the field of politics, labour relations and trade free market supporters suffered further set backs with intellectual and the moral attacks from an informal networks of progressive reformers. This included groups like the Fabians; individuals such as Keir Hardie and Pope Leo XIII with his social encyclical Rerum novarum; and national leaders like Otto von Bismarck and David Lloyd George, who both introduced early precursors of the welfare state. In the United States, this period has been labelled the Progressive Era.The link between progressive developments in the United States and Europe is covered in Polyani's Great Transformation (1944), but for a much more detailed account see Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (2000) by Daniel Rodgers. Other developments not necessarily associated with the progressive movement yet still opposed to the free market, included various countries such as the United States significantly increasing their trade tariffs. In contrast, within mainstream academia and the practice of international finance free market thinking remained largely ascendant until the 1930s. Although the gold standard had been suspended by World War I, international financiers were largely successful in re-establishing it in the 1920s. It was not until the crisis of 1931 that Britain decided to leave the gold standard, with the United States following in 1933. By the mid-1930s, the global liberal economic order had collapsed, with the old, highly integrated trading system replaced by a number of closed economic blocks. Similarly, in mainstream economics free market thinking was undermined in the 1930s by the success of the New Deal and by the Keynesian Revolution. After a transition period and World War II, embedded liberalism emerged as the dominant economic system...  Embedded liberalism: 1945‚Äì1970s  John Maynard Keynes (right) and Harry Dexter White at the Bretton Woods conference, where the key institutions that would support embedded liberalism were created Mainstream scholars such as John Ruggie tend to see embedded liberalism as a compromise between the desire to retain as many as possible of the advantages from the previous era's free market system while also allowing states to have the autonomy to pursue interventionist and welfare based domestic policies... Anticipating the trilemma that would later be formulated as the impossible trinity, John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White argued that freedom of movement for capital conflicted both with nation state's freedom to pursue economic policies based on their domestic circumstances and also with the semi-fixed exchange rate system that was widely agreed to be important to maximise international trade in goods and services. As such, it was widely agreed that states would be free to enact capital controls, which would help them simultaneously maintain both fixed exchange rates and, if desired, expansionary domestic policies.Such as Keynesian public spending to boost employment and low interest. In the absence of capital controls, investors would tend to move their money away from countries that pursued such policies, causing downward pressure on the domestic currency that would make the maintenance of fixed exchange rates difficult or impossible. During the 1950s and 1960s, embedded liberalism and Keynesian economics were so popular that conservative politicians found they had to largely adopt them if they were to have a chance of getting elected. This was especially the case in Britain and was called the post-war consensus, with a similar though somewhat less Keynesian consensus existing elsewhere, including in the United States.. Marxist scholars tend to broadly agree with the mainstream view, though they emphasise embedded liberalism as a compromise between class interests, rather than between different desirable yet partially incompatible objectives. David Harvey argues that at the end of World War II the primary objective was to develop an economic plan that would not lead to a repeat of the Great Depression during the 1930s.. Harvey states: Harvey notes that under this new system free trade was regulated \\"under a system of fixed exchange rates anchored by the US dollar's convertibility into gold at a fixed price. Fixed exchange rates were incompatible with free flows of capital\\". In addition, there was a worldwide acceptance that \\"the state should focus on full employment, economic growth, and the welfare of its citizens and that state power should be freely deployed, alongside of or, if necessary, intervening in or even substituting for market processes to achieve these ends\\". He also states that this new system came to be referred to as embedded liberalism in order to \\"signal how market processes and entrepreneurial and corporate activities were surrounded by a web of social and political constraints and a regulatory environment that sometimes restrained but in other instances led the way in economic and industrial strategy\\".. In 1960, Daniel Bell published The End of Ideology, where he celebrated what he anticipated to be an enduring change, with extreme free market thinking permanently relegated to the fringe. However, Harvey argues that while embedded liberalism led to the surge of economic prosperity which came to define the 1950s and 1960s, the system began to crack beginning in the late 1960s.. The 1970s were defined by an increased accumulation of capital, unemployment, inflation (or stagflation as it was dubbed) and a variety of fiscal crises. He notes that \\"the embedded liberalism that had delivered high rates of growth to at least the advanced capitalist countries after 1945 was clearly exhausted and no longer working\\". A number of theories concerning new systems began to develop, which led to extensive debate between those who advocated \\"social democracy and central planning on the one hand\\" and those \\"concerned with liberating corporate and business power and re-establishing market freedoms on the other\\".. Harvey notes that by 1980 the latter group had emerged as the leader, advocating and creating a global economic system that would become known as neoliberalism.  Subsequent systems  = Neoliberalism: redisembedded markets, 1981‚Äì2009 = After the transition period of the 1970s, the neoliberal era is commonly said to have begun at about 1980. Also referred to by economic historians as the Washington Consensus era, its emergence was marked by the rise to power of Margaret Thatcher in Great Britain and Ronald Reagan in the United States. While there was no attempt to revive the previous system of fixed exchange rates on a global scale, neoliberalism upheld a similar commitment to free trade as had the previous era. Similar to the era of classical economic liberalism, neoliberalism involved the disembedding of markets. At a policy level, some of the main changes involved pressure for governments to abolish their capital controls and to refrain from economic interventions. However, many of the institutions established in the previous era remained in place and free market ideology never became as influential as it had been during the peak years of classical liberalism. In a 1997 paper, Ruggie himself discussed how some of the protection gained for workers with the embedded liberal compromise still lived on, though he warned it was being eroded by the advance of market forces. In Britain and the United States, domestic free market reforms were pursued most aggressively from about 1980‚Äì1985. Yet from a global perspective, the peak years of neoliberal influence were the 1990s.. After the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, there was an acceleration of the pace at which countries throughout the world chose or were coerced into implementing free market reforms. In 1992, political scientist Francis Fukuyama suggested that free-market capitalism coupled with liberal democracy may be a stable end point in human social evolution in the End of History and the Last Man. Yet by 1999, various adverse economic events, most especially the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the harsh response by the International Monetary Fund had already caused free-market policies to be at least partially discredited in the eyes of developing world policy makers, especially in Asia and South America.Some scholars such as David Graeber credit the global justice movement with a leading role in reducing the influence of free market ideology on Asia and South America (see for example his book Debt: The First 5000 Years), though others point to a change of heart at the top, with politicians and senior official in multilateral organisations like the International Monetary Fund themselves losing faith in free market thinking. For more on the historical opposition to neoliberalism in Asia, see also Beijing Consensus and Mumbai Consensus. For more on the retreat from neoliberallism in Latin America, see the pink tide.. = Post-Washington Consensus: mixed liberalisms, 2009‚Äìpresent = In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, several journalists, politicians and senior officials from global institutions such as the World Bank began saying that the Washington Consensus was over.. As part of the 2008‚Äì2009 Keynesian resurgence, it briefly appeared that there might be a prospect of a return to embedded liberalism‚Äîthere had been an upsurge in global collaboration by the world's policy makers, with several heads of state calling for a \\"New Bretton Woods\\". Yet by 2010, the short lived consensus for a return to Keynesian policy had fractured. Economic historian Robert Skidelsky suggested it was too soon to identify the characteristics of the new global economic order and it may be that no single order will emerge. For instance, with the rise of the BRICs and other emerging economies, there is less scope for a single power to effectively set the rules for the rest of the world.As was largely the case for most of the previous two centuries, where Britain and the United States had performed this role. As of late 2011, there had been some trends consistent with a move away from economic liberalism, including a growing acceptance for a return to the use of capital controls, macroprudential regulation and state capitalism.Several large developing states had already been practicing forms of state capitalism throughout the neoliberal era, but often it was justified as short term measures to protect infant industries and economies until they were sufficiently well developed to compete in the free market. After the crises, state capitalism became more common and several states became increasingly unapologetic about it. See Ian Bremmer's book The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations. On the other hand, China has been progressively liberating its capital account well into 2012 while in the United States the Tea Party movement emerged as a powerful political force, with members who appear to be committed to a purer vision of the free market than has existed since the peak of classical liberalism in the 1840s.See Thomas Frank's 2012 book Pity the Billionaire. In 2011, professor Kevin Gallagher suggested that rather than being largely governed by a single ideology as had been the case for the previous eras, the newly emerging global order is influenced by \\"varieties of liberalism\\". However, George Monbiot said in 2013 that neoliberalism remained an influential ideology.

Exports mostly ended after 1972, when the domestic market models received redesigned pillarless bodywork. Honda subsequently marketed a kei- class SUV from 1998 to 2003, bearing no relation to the first 'Z', but bearing the same nameplate. 1970-1974 The two-door Honda Z debuted in October 1970 and was marketed until 1973 in most countries. American sales (only with the larger 600 cc engine) lasted for model years 1970 through 1972, ending prior to the 1973 introduction of the Civic. Marketed as the \\"sport coup√©\\" version of the N600, the two were sold side by side at American motorcycle dealerships until the first stand-alone automobile dealers opened to market the Civic. Total production was 40,586 units. In certain countries, such as the US, the Z600 name simply reflected the engine's size of . The smaller-engined Honda Z360 was available in Japan (and other markets, such as Australia) with a twin. In the UK they came only in 600 cc form and were called simply \\"Honda Z\\" with no mention of the engine size in the name. As with all cars in the kei class, the Z360's specifications were tightly governed. The Z360 originally featured an air-cooled, 354 cc, two-cylinder SOHC engine with a four- or five- speed transmission driving the front wheels. Outputs were at 8,500 rpm for the Act and Pro versions, and at 9,000 rpm for the sportier TS and GS models. The Z600 model's 598 cc SOHC engine was rated at . In December 1971, the Z360 received a facelift and a water-cooled engine, it also produced at 9,000 rpm. Only a month later, the 31 PS engine used in the lower spec variants (Standard, Deluxe, Automatic, Custom) also became water-cooled.Nippon Kei Car Memorial, pp. 83‚Äì84 The engine's technical achievements reflected influences from Honda's larger, 1.3 L, air-cooled four-cylinder used in the Honda 1300 coupe and sedan. The Z featured coil sprung and independent front suspension and leaf springs on a beam axle rear suspension. The interior accommodated two adults, with a very small rear seat. A rear glass hatch with a black plastic surround opened to a shallow cargo area. Below the cargo area a compartment, accessible via a lid beneath the number plate, held the spare wheel and tools. Later versions, after a November 1972 facelift, deleted the extra lid and also moved the license plate down to the position it vacated. These also received the new EA engine of , now only available in a more powerful, version.Nippon Kei Car Memorial, p. 87 Production ended in 1974, after the new Civic had arrived and the oil crisis had diminished the market for \\"fun\\" cars. =Europe= In Europe only the Z600 was marketed, as the N360 had been considered underpowered. 918 cars were sold in Europe, most of them in France and Switzerland. A large number of these cars found their way to Germany (where it had not been marketed), where the engines were downsleeved to 242 cc in order to fit a particular \\"Class IV\\" category of driver's licenses which did not require an exam. These models first appeared in 1969 after the last 250 cc car in regular production, the Goggomobil 250, had been discontinued. The engine offered from and provided a top speed of . 1998-2002 The Honda Z was a retro-styled subcompact (656 cc) SUV by Honda Motor Company, introduced in 1998 at Honda Primo Japanese dealerships, and discontinued in autumn 2002. It was a two-door version of the Honda Life with the engine installed in the center of the vehicle. Launched on October 9, 1998 the PA1 Honda Z was manufactured for Honda by Yachiyo Industry Co, a Honda subsidiary manufacturing light trucks. The basic structure of the Z, including its midship-mounted engine placement and 4WD drivetrain was shared with its Honda Acty sibling. Unlike the Acty though, it was a four-seater passenger car which also meant that it had to pass passenger car safety standards. The 656 cc E07Z three-cylinder engine was available in a naturally aspirated as well as in a turbocharged variant. The Z was only ever available with a four-speed automatic transmission, the same that was used on the EF Honda Civics. The centrally mounted engine was placed in an upright position underneath the rear seat, a layout called \\"UM-4\\" (stands for Under Midship 4WD) by Honda. Engine oil changes and minor maintenance work is done through an interior door. As with other mid-engined, four-wheel-drive vehicles, such as the Lamborghini Diablo VT, a viscous center differential was used. Some noteworthy and unusual design features of the Z included the comparatively large-diameter tires, chunky \\"grip-style\\" door handles, and the adoption of perspex double-cover headlights. Fully equipped Z Turbo While the Honda Capa was the first car in the \\"J-Mover\\" series, the third generation Life and new Honda Z made up the \\"K-Mover\\" series. Famous rock group ZZ Top made the introductory commercial, including a song and video (\\"ZZ Top on the Z\\"). Since the car's name has always been pronounced \\"zed\\" („Çº„ÉÉ„Éà) by Honda, in the British fashion, the Americans in ZZ Top had to follow suit. In June 2000 a special \\"Super Emotion\\" package appeared, with body-colored bumpers, CD player with speakers and tinted glass for a small extra cost. This proved so popular that body-colored bumpers were soon made standard on turbo models. In August 2002, with stricter exhaust emission about to take effect, Honda ended production of the Z. This was to be Honda's first and last SUV Kei-car. Honda also sold a side-mounted step and wheel-arch protector, but these were only for after-market fitment as they made the car too wide for kei regulations and were not crash tested. The naturally aspirated version had at 7,000 rpm, while the turbocharged and intercooled version pushed out at 6,000 rpm. The engine had four valves per cylinder, Honda's PGM-FI fuel injection system, and were classified as LEVs.

It was not referred to as such in its own time, but the name was given later owing to the sharply increased number of people given the death penalty, even for crimes considered minor or misdemeanor by 21st century standards. History In 1688 there were 50 offences on the statute book punishable by death, but that number had almost quadrupled by 1776, and it reached 220 by the end of the century. Most of the new laws introduced during that period were concerned with the defence of property, which some commentators have interpreted as a form of class suppression of the poor by the rich. George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, expressed a contemporary view when he said that \\"Men are not hanged for stealing horses, but that horses may not be stolen\\". Grand larceny was one of the crimes that drew the death penalty; it was defined as the theft of goods worth more than 12 pence, about one-twentieth of the weekly wage for a skilled worker at the time. As the 18th century proceeded jurors often deliberately under-assessed the value of stolen goods in order to avoid a mandatory death sentence. As the 17th century drew to a close, lawmakers sought a less harsh punishment that might still deter potential offenders; penal transportation with a term of indentured servitude became the more common punishment. This trend was continued by the Transportation Act 1717 (16 Geo. 3 c.43), which regulated and subsidised the practice, until its use was suspended by the Criminal Law Act 1776.\\"An act to authorise, for a limited time, the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\\" With the American Colonies already in active rebellion, parliament claimed its continuance \\"is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil course\\". This law would become known as the Hard Labour Act and the Hulks Act for both its purpose and its result. With the removal of the important transportation alternative to the death penalty, it would in part prompt the use of prisons for punishment and the start of prison building programmes. Drew D. Gray, Crime, Policing and Punishment in England, 1660-1914 p.298 (2016) In 1785 Australia would be deemed a suitably desolate place to transport convicts; transportation would resume, now to a specifically planned penal colony, with the departure of the First Fleet in 1787. It has been estimated that over one-third of all criminals convicted between 1788 and 1867 were transported to Australia, including Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania). Some criminals could escape transportation if they agreed to join the army. Jurist William Blackstone said of the Bloody Code: Relaxation of the law In 1823 the Judgement of Death Act 1823 made the death penalty discretionary for all crimes except treason and murder. Gradually during the middle of the nineteenth century, the number of capital offences was reduced, and by 1861 was down to five.

It introduces a complete universe for role-playing and wargaming space combat featuring mecha, giant spacecraft, and epic space battles. The Jovian Chronicles setting was originally published as a pair of licensed supplements for the Mekton role- playing game; Ianus Publications released two volumes‚ÄîJovian Chronicles and Europa Incident‚Äîin 1992. This first edition is known amongst fans as the \\"Green Edition\\" because of the color scheme of its cover design. After Ianus decided to split into two ventures in 1995 ‚Äî Protoculture, which would publish Protoculture Addicts magazine; and Dream Pod 9, which would design and market miniatures and gaming books, Jovian Chronicles was re-published as a full- fledged game line in 1997 by Dream Pod 9, this time using their own in-house rule system. This edition, because of its white cover, is known as the \\"White Edition\\", and subsequent supplements are also called this, even though several of the supplemental books feature a dark blue starfield cover. Publication history Ianus Publications had licensed the anime-related games of R. Talsorian Games, and Marc A. Vezina's Jovian Chronicles (1994) detailed an original setting for R. Talsorian's Mekton game. It had originally been intended as a serial for the company's Mecha Press magazine. Jovian Chronicles was supplemented soon after with Europa Incident (1994). Dream Pod 9 was soon split out from Ianus as a separate company, and their second game after Heavy Gear was Jovian Chronicles (1998), a game based on Dream Pod 9's Silhouette system, and a variant of the game setting that they had previously created for use with Mekton. The new edition included changes to the theme of the game, which was now an anime mecha game, a space-opera starfighter game and a near- future built on with hard science. Many of the mecha were made blockier in design to better accommodate a potential Activision game that never came to be. The later Silhouette CORE Rulebook (2003) offered a new standalone version of Silhouette that turned it into a generic system, and was immediately followed by the Mecha Companion (2003), which offered d20 stats for all the mecha from Heavy Gear, Jovian Chronicles and Gear Krieg using Guardians of Order's d20 Mecha (2003) mech description rules. Jovian Chronicles second edition was also released in 2003. In 2017, Dream Pod 9 launched a Kickstarter to create new resin spaceship miniatures. The goal was to raise 9,000 CAD; with the support of 143 backers, they raised a total of 25,090 CAD. Dream Pod 9 reported that by November 2017 they had \\"completed the shipping of Backer Reward Packages\\". In 2018, they launched a second Kickstarter to create additional new spaceships and exo-armor squad miniatures. The goal was smaller this time (4,000 CAD) and while it was successful, it was less successful than the first Kickstarter (57 backers raising 8,708 CAD). Dream Pod 9 reported that they had begun shipping out \\"Backer Reward Packages\\" in April 2019. During this time, Beta Playtest Rules for a new edition, called Jovian Wars, were released for free on DrivethruRPG as a PDF. These rules were last updated on February 14, 2018. Setting The game world shows one possible future, a time in which Mankind has expanded and settled the solar system, going as far as terraforming Venus and Mars. The colonists living around Jupiter are at odds with the government of Earth, driving much of the series' intrigue. The game features a blend of action/adventure and hard-science space colonization facts. The books are based on plausible technical details to maintain a realistic hard science fiction setting. *Mercury: a small settlement, whose main exports are high quality electronics and metals. Mercury is the headquarters of the powerful Merchant Guild, an association of companies which provide most of the transportation throughout the system. *Venus: terraformed by a consortium of corporations, Venus is now a marginally habitable planet. The Venusian upper class and their workers live in polar arcologies, surrounded by terraforming processors. *Earth: damaged by centuries of overpopulation and civil wars, the motherworld is home to the Central Earth Government and Administration (CEGA), a bureaucratic planetary government that believes the Earth should lead the solar system. *Orbital Colonies: the salvation of many who fled Earth, these are huge O'Neill stations parked at the Lagrange points. Orbitals are peaceful people who follow CEGA's lead for protection. *United Solar Nations: evolved from the old United Nations to provide a neutral arbiter between the various settlements. It has a private peace-keeping army, the USN Guard, and an interplanetary law enforcement agency, the Solar Police (SolaPol). *The Moon: CEGA's industrial center, its inhabitants are living in huge complexes buried beneath the soil. Many of Earth's heavy industries were moved there long ago. *Mars: a divided planet, home to the Martian Free Republic and the Martian Federation. Border clashes between the two are frequent. *The Belt: the asteroids are populated by mobile nomad communities, each a micro-society of its own. *Jupiter: home to refugees from Earth. The enormous space stations of the Jovian Confederacy were the first to develop and field exo-armors. Thanks to the resources of the Jovian sub-system, the Confederacy is the richest nation in the solar system. *Titan: the largest moon of Saturn is the farthest human settlement. It is the main source for complex hydrocarbon compounds and plays an important role in the industries of the solar system. Anime inspirations Many recent Western cartoon shows and games have Japanese anime styling. Jovian Chronicles also features anime-inspired artwork and narrative elements, though the various technical elements (ships, stations, equipment, etc.) are original works illustrated with computer art. Exo-armors are one of the main hooks of the series, these one-crew mecha consist of big armored space suits talling 15 metres or more with weapons capable of devastating even small warships. The main source of inspiration for the game was the various iterations of the Gundam Universal Century series up to the early 1990s, with strong influence from Gundam 0083 Stardust Memories and Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket. Hints of other influences such as Patlabor and to some extent, Macross and Mospeada, are present, although no transformable mecha appear to date. Jovian Chronicles can be placed in the Real Robot anime genre. The series art and mechanical designs were created by John Moscato and Ghislain Barbe, the latter who was also responsible for the artistic style which characterized all of the Dream Pod 9's lines including Heavy Gear and Tribe 8. Game rules The concept has its origins on a campaign played by the authors Mark A. Vezina and Etienne Gagnon since 1987, using R. Talsorian's Mekton system. After 5 years of development, IANVS plublications licensed the Mekton II rules and published the Jovian Chronicles Campaign Setting, a 112-page letter sized book which describes the JC universe, timeline, technologies and introduces players to the setting thru a 12 episode campaign. The JC campaign works as an extension of the Mekton rules set, with minimum changes required and then only for character status and wealth, however, compared to other Mecha depicted in Mekton, JC Exo-armors tend to be less resilient and their weapons are less powerful. It is also of note that at this stage, Exos tend to be more balanced with little differences among them, while on later editions, grunt exos are intentionally inferior to hero machines, for example, a CEGA Syreen and a JC Pathfinder are equally balanced in power, armor and weapons, and similar in capabilities to larger machines. Mecha designs also vary on this edition, being more complex and elaborated in design than on latter iterations, during this release, there were also a number of metal miniatures for six of the exo- armors in the setting, these were produced by Canadian manufacturer RAFM and were based on the campaign book technical designs by John Moscato. Miniatures were in 1/325 scale due to the fictional size of the exo-armors and presented one of the finest and most dynamic mecha sculptings of the era. The second release of Jovian Chronicles, was the first one published by DP9, adapts the Silhouette game system, a streamlined set of rules already tested and proved in Heavy Gear, Dream Pod 9's other successful science fiction game. It can be played as either a role-playing game, a tactical wargame, or an integration of both. There are major changes on this release, such as the aforementioned distinction among the different exo-armors and other equipment as well as the focus on the character creation. Both the RPG and miniature games are built on the same basic rule mechanics. Silhouette which defines characters in terms of 10 base attributes (agility, knowledge, etc.), 5 derived attributes (health, etc.), and a variety of skills. Skill rolls make up the backbone of the system, which focuses on effect-based speed of play over grainy detail. The core mechanic involves rolling a number of 6-sided dice, taking the highest result, adding in modifiers for attributes and/or situation, and then comparing it to a set threshold number. If the result is higher than the threshold the test is a success; if it is lower the test is a failure. The margin by which the test succeeded (Margin of Success, MoS) or failed (Margin of Failure, MoF) helps to determine the final outcome. Combat is handled by the same system, with characters taking penalty-inflicting wounds rather than depleting a set number of health points. As a result, the system can be lethal, especially on inexperienced characters. New miniatures were also released for this edition, for both, exo-armor/fighters as well as spaceships. The new line of miniatures covered a much broader range of subjects, at the expense of size, being scaled at 1/500 for the exo armor/fighters which were near half the size of the original ones, this edition also marks the appearance of spaceship miniatures, which were scaled to 1/5000. During this stage, the game system was splintered into the Silhouette Core RPG rules and the Lightning Strike system for tactical scenarios. The latter, is a more abstract version of the original tactical system which allow for combined arms maneuvers. A third edition Jovian Wars was put on kickstarter during March- April 2017 and is in the process of delivering to its backers, the new edition is a fleet scale tactical game, whose rules are distributed for free at the DP9 website and changes (again) the scale of the miniatures to 1/1000 to exo- armors and fighters and 1/4000 for the spaceships. This change in scale intends to represent more realistically the magnitude of the conflicts depicted, making combat units smaller and warships larger. It features a new turning template for ship maneuvers which is promoted as the major innovation in the system and due to the scale of the exo-armors, they now operate in squadrons of 3 miniatures each. With the new scale, each exo/fighter is around 15mm in height, compared to 30mm for Lightning strike minis and an average of 54mm for RAFM miniatures. The RPG aspect of the game is all but left aside. The project was funded, however it is uncertain if besides backers, other potential or new players will accept the scale change which has turned the exo-armors, an emblematic symbol of the series and marketing hook (first edition depicted a full page illustration of a Jovian Exo-armor on cover which was also used on the RAFM blister's card) into a sort of battle counter (size matters... sometime), rather focusing on ship to ship maneuvers. Reception In September 1994, White Wolf gave the game a 3.5 out of 5 rating and said the game \\"offers a lot of material in a beautiful package\\". Jovian Chronicles was featured on the front cover of the March-April 1997 edition of Pyramid (Vol. 1, Issue 24), and a sneak preview of the game was offered inside the same issue. In the February 1998 edition of Dragon (Issue 244), Rick Swan reviewed both the Jovian Chronicles setting and the Heavy Gear setting (also published by Dream Pod 9), and praised the high production values: \\"Both are beautiful games, into which a lot of effort has been invested.\\" Swan admired the \\"Silhouette\\" game system, calling it \\"the smartest set of universal rules this side of the GURPS game.\\" But he criticized the combat rules, which he called \\"more work than fun\\", and he found little to be excited about in the setting, saying, \\"There's nothing terribly interesting going on here, and the game's ambitions seem awfully modest compared to the wide screen spectacle of Trinity.\\" Given the setting's emphasis on robot combat, Swan believed that \\"Jovian Chronicles aims at players more interested in hardware than human beings.\\" He concluded with an ambivalent shrug: \\"Other than the lifeless settings, I couldn‚Äôt find anything seriously wrong with... Jovian Chronicles. But I couldn‚Äôt find much to be excited about either.\\" A review of the Ship of the Fleet, Vol. 4 ‚Äî a supplement describing six Venusian ships of the Jovian Chronicles line ‚Äî that appeared in the August 11, 2000 issue of Pyramid found the supplement had failed in the small details that other works by Dream Pod 9 had possessed, saying \\"Being truly excellent is a double-edged sword: On the one hand, of course, you're excellent -- and that comes with a lot of perks. On the other hand, though, you have set yourself a very high standard indeed -- and a failure in the details suddenly becomes a notable offense.\\" Reviews *Mecha Press #10 (Nov./Dec. 1993) *Alarums & Excursions #313 (Sept. 2001) *Pyramid Volume 1 Issue #24 (March/April 1997) References External links *Dream Pod 9 (Publisher) J Canadian role-playing games Dream Pod 9 games Earth in fiction Jupiter in fiction Main-belt asteroids in fiction Mars in fiction Mercury (planet) in fiction Miniature wargames Science fiction role-playing games Solar System in fiction Titan (moon) in fiction Venus in fiction Mecha role-playing games ","title":"Jovian Chronicles"},{"id":"1770193","text":"Chavannes-le-Veyron is a municipality in the district of Morges in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland.

Plot overview A Perfect Spy is the life story of Magnus Pym, a British intelligence officer and double agent. After attending his father's funeral, Pym mysteriously disappears. As his fellow intelligence officers frantically search for him it becomes clear that, throughout most of his career, Magnus worked as a spy for the Czechoslovak secret service. Although intrigue, wit, and suspense make up much of the novel, the story of Magnus Pym is partly an unadorned recollection of his childhood and memories of his father Rick Pym. The non-linear narrative cuts back and forth between the present-day manhunt for Pym (being conducted by his mentor, boss, and longtime friend, Jack Brotherhood), and Pym's first- person reminiscences of his life as, in hiding, he writes a memoir explaining to his family and friends why he betrayed his country. It incorporates flashbacks to Pym's childhood with his father, the enterprising charismatic rogue and con-man, Rick; to his early years at school and university; to his amorous adventures, to his introduction to espionage and state secrets; and to his encounters with long-time friend and Czech spy Axel. The portraits reveal Pym as a man who for so long has manipulated his appearance to those closest to him that, in the end, he was unable to hold together the conflicting personae within him. Magnus Pym has been a perfect spy, but at the cost of his soul. Autobiographical aspects A large part of the novel is a thinly disguised account of le Carr√©'s own early life. Before he became a novelist, David Cornwell (John le Carr√©) was an intelligence officer for MI6, the British intelligence service, although there are no allegations that he ever betrayed his country and spied for another country like the character Magnus Pym. Like Magnus, le Carr√© lost his mother at an early age, was sent to an abusive prep school, studied languages at the University of Berne in Switzerland, in the 1950s worked for the Intelligence Corps of the British Army in Austria interrogating Czech defectors, and at the University of Oxford spied on far-left student groups for MI5, the British security service. Rick Pym, the charismatic con man father of Magnus in the novel, is based on le Carr√©'s father, Ronnie Cornwell. Ronnie was a confidence man and associate of the Kray twins, London organised crime figures. He made and lost several fortunes through elaborate confidence schemes, and was jailed for insurance fraud. Le Carr√©'s biographer Lynndianne Beene describes Ronnie as 'an epic con man of little education, immense charm, extravagant tastes, but no social values'. Le Carr√©'s relationship with his father was troubled, and he has said: > \\"Although I've never been to a shrink, writing A Perfect Spy is probably > what a very wise shrink would have advised me to do anyway.\\" Literary significance and criticism Matthew Bruccoli calls it \\"the book that is and may always be Le Carr√©'s masterpiece\\". Philip Roth said it was \\"the best English novel since the war\\". David Denby, writing in 2014, agreed with Roth's view.Which is the Best John le Carre Novel?

The Inuit named him \\"Saumik,\\" which means \\"the left-handed one\\". Biography Born in St. Catharines, Ontario, James Houston studied art as a child with Arthur Lismer and was educated at the Ontario College of Art (1938‚Äì40), Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris (1947‚Äì48) and in Japan (1958‚Äì59) where he studied printmaking. He fought in World War II with the Toronto Scottish Regiment, receiving the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal. After the war, he went to the Eastern Arctic to paint and lived there for twelve years. He was a northern service officer and civil administrator of western Baffin Island. In 1962, he moved to New York and became associate director of design with Steuben Glass. Moving effortlessly and with great success between different activities, perhaps his biggest accomplishment was his work in the Eastern Arctic of Canada, developing Inuit art. In 1948, Houston traveled to a small Inuit community in Arctic Quebec, Inukjuak (then Port Harrison), to draw and paint images of the Inuit and the Arctic landscape. He traded his own drawings, done on the spot, for a small carving, by an Inuit hunter named Nayoumealuk,. of a seated deer. Houston recognized its aesthetic appeal and returned to the Canadian Handicrafts Guild, in Montreal, with roughly a dozen small carvings, done mostly in steatite. The guild, which had tried as early as the 1920s to foster an Inuit-handicrafts market, was impressed with the carving; they were equally impressed by Houston. The guild secured a federal government grant of $1,100 and sent Houston back north in the summer of 1949 to make bulk purchases in various communities in the Eastern Arctic. When Houston returned to Montreal that fall, the guild mounted their first exhibition of Inuit carvings. According to collector Ian Lindsay, the first exhibition was a complete sell-out. The government put more resources into developing an art and handicrafts market in the Arctic, hiring Houston to live in Cape Dorset as the first \\"roving crafts officer\\", and tapping him to write promotional material for sales in the south. The guild's fall sales exhibitions became annual affairs, with lineups routinely stretching out the door and down the block on Peel Street. By the late 1950s, the Government had sponsored tours of Inuit art through Eastern and Western Europe, South America and the Middle East. After successfully launching Inuit sculpture, Houston introduced printmaking in 1957, which met with the same success. Houston lived in Cape Dorset with his wife Alma Houston and his two sons, Samuel and John Houston until 1962, when the couple split and he moved to New York City. He was writer and producer of the 1974 film based on his novel, The White Dawn. In 1976, his 70-foot high acrylic and aluminum sculpture \\"Aurora Borealis\\" was installed in Calgary's new Glenbow Museum, where it is still on display. He died in New London, Connecticut, aged 83.

It was first published in 1963 as Part II of the International Journal of American Linguistics, Vol. 29, No. 1; however, its second edition of 1966, in which it was published (by Indiana University, Bloomington: Mouton & Co., The Hague) as an independent work, is more commonly cited. Its author describes it as based on three fundamentals of method: * \\"The sole relevance in comparison of resemblances involving both sound and meaning in specific forms.\\" * \\"Mass comparison as against isolated comparisons between pairs of languages.\\" * \\"Only linguistic evidence is relevant in drawing conclusions about classification.\\" Innovations Greenberg's Niger‚ÄìCongo family was substantially foreshadowed by Westermann's \\"Western Sudanic\\", but he changed the subclassification, including Fulani (as West Atlantic) and the newly postulated Adamawa‚ÄìEastern, excluding Songhai, and classifying Bantu as merely a subfamily of Benue‚ÄìCongo (previously termed \\"Semi-Bantu\\"). Semitic, Berber, Egyptian and Cushitic had been generally accepted as members of a \\"Hamito-Semitic\\" family, while Chadic, Fulani, \\"Nilo- Hamitic\\" and Hottentot had all been controversially proposed as members. He accepted Chadic (while changing its membership), and rejected the other three, establishing to most linguists' satisfaction that they had been classified as \\"Hamitic\\" for purely typological reasons. This demonstration also led to the rejection (by him and by linguistics as a whole) of the term Hamitic as having no coherent meaning in historical linguistics; as a result, he renamed the newly reclassified family \\"Afroasiatic\\". Following Schapera and rejecting Meinhof, he classified Hottentot as a member of the Central Khoisan languages. To Khoisan he also added the much more northerly Hadza (Hatsa) and Sandawe. His most revolutionary step was the postulation of the Nilo-Saharan family. This is still controversial, because so far attempts to reconstruct this family have been unsuccessful, but it holds promise and is it widely used. Prior linguists had noticed an apparent relationship between the majority of the languages, but had never formally proposed a family. These languages ‚Äì the Eastern Sudanic, Central Sudanic, Kunama and Berta branches ‚Äì Greenberg placed into a core group he called Chari‚ÄìNile, to which he added all the remaining unclassified languages of Africa that did not have noun classes. The distinction between Chari‚ÄìNile and the peripheral branches has since been abandoned. On a lower level, he placed \\"Nilo-Hamitic\\" firmly within Nilotic, following a suggestion of K√∂hler, and placed Eastern Sudanic on a firmer foundation. Finally, he assigned the unclassified languages of the Nuba Hills of Kordofan to the Niger‚ÄìCongo family, calling the result Congo‚ÄìKordofanian. The relationship has been accepted, with the exception of the \\"Tumtum\\" group, though the Kordofanian languages are no longer seen as being a primary branch, and the name 'Congo‚ÄìKordofanian' is no longer used. Greenberg's four families became the dominant conception of African languages, though his subclassification did not fare as well. Niger‚àíCongo and Afroasiatic are nearly universally accepted, with no significant support for Hamitic or the independence of Bantu. Nilo-Saharan is still considered provisional. Khoisan is now rejected by specialists, except as a term of convenience, though it may be retained in less specialized literature.

Gifford Arboretum, located on the campus of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida The John C. Gifford Arboretum is an arboretum and botanical garden located at the northwest corner of the University of Miami campus in Coral Gables, Florida in the United States. History The Arboretum was founded in 1947, by Prof. Frank J. Rimoldi and Dr. Roy Woodbury. In 1949 it was named for Prof. John C. Gifford, an expert on tropical woods and professor of tropical forestry at the University of Miami. In 1950, the Gifford Society of Tropical Botany was formed to promote the study of tropical plants, and the arboretum grew to more than 500 plants. Development and preservation Coral Gables resident Kathryn Gaubatz has been an active force within the community, and is currently working to preserve and protect the John C. Gifford Arboretum from future development. In 2005, the Coral Gables City Commission voted to approve the construction of a road within the Coral Gables campus. The reasoning for this vote was to ease traffic off of San Amaro Drive, US-1, and Granada Boulevard, the three main streets which encircle the campus and therefore handle the vast majority of vehicular traffic coming and leaving from the University of Miami. The Coral Gables Planning Department will review and edit any plans for proposal for the suggested road through the Coral Gables UM campus. The overall design and impact on traffic will be taken into consideration and then proposed to the Coral Gables City Commission for final vote and approval. As of 2007 leading into 2008 and 2009, no plans for the proposed street were submitted to the Coral Gables Planning Department. Citing the University's cessation of all construction projects, the proposed street through the University of Miami's Coral Gables campus has been indefinitely postponed and is not a talking point within the Coral Gables community. Access The University of Miami campus is served by the Miami Metrorail at the University Station. External links * Official John C.

It is the first book of the Dragon Prince trilogy. Plot summary Rohan is heir to the throne of The Desert and its chief holding, Stronghold. His father, Prince Zehava, is unsure of his son's ability to rule, but is wounded in a dragon hunt and Rohan is suddenly the ruling Prince. He must solidify his right to rule by outwitting The Desert's antagonists, chiefly the High Prince Roelstra, in order to protect his lands and maintain peace throughout the world. His aunt, Andrade, the Lady of Goddess Keep and highest ranking of the faradhi, or Sunrunners, gifted humans who can use light to communicate, warns that the High Prince will try to take over the Desert by marrying one of his daughters to Rohan and then killing him. To decline a royal marriage would in turn insult Roelstra, so she offers a marriage with Sioned, another of her Sunrunners. Marriage between a prince and a Sunrunner is unheard of, but Rohan is smitten by a vision of Sioned that Andrade conjures in fire for him. Rohan persuades Sioned to help him trick High Prince Roelstra into signing various treaties while he pretends to choose between princesses. Sioned pretends to be unsure of Rohan as her groom, and the two have a merry time with their charade at the tri-annual Rialla (a fair and gathering of princes held every three years). Rohan pretends to be a foolish, ignorant young man. The other princes initially believe the masquerade. Roelstra, in turn, is interested in Sioned, both as a woman and a faradhi. High Prince Roelstra is an evil, cunning man and the father of seventeen daughters. Despite a marriage and a series of mistresses, he never succeeds at conceiving a son and heir. His latest mistress, Lady Palila, is pregnant during the Rialla. Roelstra's eldest daughter, Princess Ianthe, schemes with her sister Pandsala to switch Palila's baby for a girl if it is a son. Pandsala, thinking Roelstra will marry her to Prince Rohan if Palila helps her, plans to turn the tables on Ianthe and help Palila switch another daughter for a boy. They bring four pregnant waiting- women along, planning to induce labor in them when Palila's begins. Rohan and Roelstra ultimately spar over Sioned, and Roelstra is infuriated to discover Rohan played him for a fool. Ianthe betrays Palila and her sister, and gains her father's trust. In return, she is granted the castle of Feruche, an important outpost on the border between Roelstra's and Rohan's lands. Roelstra gives Pandsala and the new baby, named Chiana (for \\"treason\\" in an old language), to Andrade. He burns Palila alive in her bed. Rohan and Sioned are married and return to the Desert, but Sioned fails to conceive a hoped-for heir. She suffers a series of miscarriages, and the entire realm is decimated by Plague in the ensuing years. Sioned is comforted by a vision of herself with Rohan's child at her breast, although she knows she cannot bear his baby. Ianthe's men capture Rohan and bring him to her at Feruche castle, where she seduces him, convincing the drugged prince she is Sioned. Rohan discovers the truth and violently rapes Ianthe. Ianthe also captures Sioned, locks her in a lightless dungeon underneath Feruche and allows her castle guards to rape her. Sioned realizes the child in her vision is Ianthe's, and refrains from killing her when Ianthe finally releases them. Rohan and Sioned return to find Stronghold besieged. Rohan goes to war with Roelstra while Sioned waits out Ianthe's pregnancy. Rohan doubts he can claim this child as his, although Sioned is confident they can defeat Roelstra and claim Ianthe's son as their own. When Ianthe gives birth, Sioned returns to Feruche, steals Ianthe's newborn son, and burns Castle Feruche to the ground. Sioned names the child Pol, which means \\"star\\" in the Old Tongue. At the same time, Rohan kills Roelstra in a duel and becomes High Prince in his stead. The novel ends with the other princes proclaiming fealty to High Prince Rohan and High Princess Sioned, and accepting Prince Pol, the new Sunrunner heir.

General Sir George Pomeroy Colley's communications with Newcastle were under constant harassment by mounted Boer patrols under Commander J D Weilbach after the Battle of Laing's Nek (another British defeat) and as a result he planned to clear a path along the Newcastle-Mount Prospect road to better protect the British supply line, and receive fresh reinforcements he needed to bolster his ranks. The Battle At roughly 9:00am he left the Mount Prospect camp with a force consisting mostly of infantrymen. A company of the 60th Rifles (King's Royal Rifle Corps) and two artillery pieces were left at a ridge overlooking the Ingogo River, while a handful of mounted men and infantry covered the drift. As Colley advanced up the slope of the Ingogo he received word from his scouting party that a mainly mounted Boer force under Gen. Nicolaas Smit and Comdt. J D Weilbach was approaching nearby. The British formed circular/squared defensive positions on the crest of the ridge with 240 infantry, 38 cavalry and two pieces of artillery while the roughly 300 Boers attempted to surround them and cut them off from escape. From noon until about 5:00 that evening a series of close range engagements was fought and the British suffered heavily from the accurate and concentrated Boer fire. Although the 60th Rifles wore dark green (in fact, almost black) uniforms, these were still in contrast to the light-coloured South African veldt, the only concession to camouflage being the white foreign service helmet stained khaki with tea. The gunners and mounted troops also wore dark uniforms, but the gunners in particular were exposed when working their guns. In contrast the Boers wore khaki coloured clothing, and were also expert at fieldcraft, thus being able to blend into the environment. Afterward heavy rain began to fall and the battle came to an abrupt end. Rainfall swelled the Ingogo river, making it very difficult to ford. Boer forces, imagining that the British would be unable to cross, especially with artillery, waited during the night to resume the battle the next day. Colley's men, meanwhile, made a desperate night march, and managed to escape, horses, guns and all, although several men drowned in the river crossing. The Boer failure to assault and capture the guns during the rainstorm, allowing the British column to escape, probably represents their only major error during the war. Aftermath It has been speculated had Colley received his reinforcements before the onslaught of the rain, he would probably have been able to defeat the Boers for the first time and give the British better bargaining power during the peace negotiations. When the British returned with a burial party the next day, they found the Boers had returned to take care of their own dead and wounded. No engagement occurred. The eight Boer dead were buried on the farm \\"Geelhoutboom\\" some 5 km west of the battle site. The British lost seven officers and 69 men killed and 68 wounded. The men were buried on the battlefield while the officers' bodies were exhumed four days later and taken to Fort Amiel for reburial. Colley was plagued by defeat throughout the war, and although he would receive his reinforcements, his men were seriously demoralized by the string of defeats. Eventually he would be killed in action at the Battle of Majuba Hill.

The original Trieste design was heavily modified by the Naval Electronics Laboratory in San Diego, California and built at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Trieste II incorporated the original Terni, Italian-built sphere used in Trieste, after it was made redundant by the new high-pressure sphere cast by the German Krupp Steelworks. The Trieste sphere was suspended from an entirely new float, more seaworthy and streamlined than the original but operating on identical principles.

He was deaf from a bout of scarlet fever at the age of four and attended the California School for the Deaf in Berkeley, California (now in Fremont, California). He sculpted many statues that are located today throughout San Francisco, Berkeley, and the San Francisco Bay Area.  Early life  Douglas Tilden was born on May 1, 1860 to Dr. William Peregrine Tilden and Catherine Maria Hecox Tilden in Chico, California. When he was four, he lost his hearing and speech after a severe bout of scarlet fever. Tilden entered the California School for the Deaf (then located in San Francisco) on January 25, 1866, studying under Theophilus d'Estrella. He moved with the School to a location near the University of California, Berkeley campus at what is now the Clark Kerr Campus student residence in 1869 and graduated in 1879. After graduating, he went on to attend and teach at UC Berkeley, where he studied with Francis Marion Wells. Tilden picked up sculpting in 1883, producing a small statuette entitled Tired Wrestler in 1885 which drew the attention of the board of the California School for the Deaf. The board subsequently offered him an opportunity to pursue sculpting and in 1887, he left Berkeley to attend the Academy of Design in New York, and from there, left to study art in Paris. After arriving in Paris in 1888, Tilden studied under , another deaf sculptor. The Football Players (1900) in 2013 After several successful years in Paris, Tilden returned to the California School for the Deaf in 1893; however, after getting married in 1896, Tilden left the School to pursue sculpting full-time under reportedly acrimonious terms. Because his stint in Paris had been paid by the School, they felt he should continue to serve as a teacher, while Tilden felt his schooling had been a gift. In return, the California School for the Deaf confiscated one of Tilden's early artworks, The Bear Hunt, as payment.  Career  Illustration of Tilden from 1901 Tilden was first recognized for his sculpture while in Paris. His first exhibited work, entitled The National Game, The Baseball Player, or The Ball Player, was a sculpture of a baseball pitcher in his windup. The sculpture was admitted to the prestigious Salon event in 1889, where it won a medal. This was followed by The Tired Boxer (exhibited at the Salon Paris in 1890), The Young Acrobat (Salon 1891), The Bear Hunt (Salon 1892), and The Football Players (Salon 1893). Many detect a certain homoeroticism in his works because they feature young athletic men who are often unclothed. In the Football Players, many people have noted that the scene of two young football players, one is injured and resting on the shoulder of another, and the other is tenderly bandaging the wounds, shows the intimate male bonding in sports as of interdependence between the players. The gay and lesbian community has adopted the statue as representing the best ideal of the visible queer community on the Berkeley campus. He was a member of the National Sculpture Society. The Football Players marked the beginning of Tilden's association with his most important patron, James D. Phelan, who commissioned Tilden's next major work after returning to the Bay Area, the Admission Day fountain installed on Market Street in 1897. In 1901, Tilden was declared \\"violently insane\\" after an incident at his father-in-law's house where he without warning \\"began destroying the furniture in the room\\" in which his family was gathered. The incident had been exaggerated by a household servant. Tilden had returned home early and, forgetting his key, had entered the house through an open window. The servant, who had been recently hired and believed this to be uncharacteristic of his employer, locked Tilden in his room, and Tilden attempted to alert others that he was trapped by hammering on the door. The frightened servant then called for the police, who took Tilden away to a mental hospital. After separating from his wife Bessie in 1918, Tilden moved into his studio and worked for the Hal Roach Studio, sculpting animals for movie sets.

Although the union produced two children, a daughter Gladys (born January 5, 1900) and a son Willoughby Lee (born September 4, 1903), it was not to prove to be a happy one. Over the years Mrs. Tilden was subject to \\"melancholia spells\\" which, among things, placed a large amount of pressure on the relationship. They separated and Mrs. Tilden, who for years had managed their properties, rented out his studio to a theater group, forcing Tilden to do his sculpting in a shed. As they grew farther apart Tilden's lawyer wrote: \\"Furthermore, the wife (Bessie) has knowledge of personal indescressions in the personal conduct of Mr. Tilden which would deprive him of any capacity to stand in court, as we say, \\"with clean hands.\\" Mr. Tilden claims that Mrs. Tilden has been indescrete .\\" The couple separated in 1918, and Bessie subsequently filed for divorce in 1924, which was finalized in 1926. Tilden was found dead in his Berkeley studio on August 6, 1935. He is buried in the Cole family plot of Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California with his ex-wife Bessie (died 1949) and Willoughby (died 1931). In 2017, the Tilden Hotel at Taylor & O'Farrell in San Francisco was renamed to honor Douglas Tilden; it originally opened as the Linden Hotel in 1928 and was renamed almost immediately to the Hotel Mark Twain.

By 5500 BCE a number of sites similar to Mehrgarh had appeared, forming the basis of later chalcolithic cultures. The inhabitants of these sites maintained trading relations with Near East and Central Asia.Kenoyer, 230 Irrigation was developed in the Indus Valley Civilization by around 4500 BCE. The size and prosperity of the Indus civilization grew as a result of this innovation, which eventually led to more planned settlements making use of drainage and sewerage.Rodda & Ubertini, 279 Sophisticated irrigation and water storage systems were developed by the Indus Valley Civilization, including artificial reservoirs at Girnar dated to 3000 BCE, and an early canal irrigation system from c. 2600 BCE.Rodda & Ubertini, 161 Cotton was cultivated in the region by the 5th‚Äì4th millennia BCE.Stein, 47 Sugarcane was originally from tropical South and Southeast Asia.

Calibration was also found in measuring devices along with multiple subdivisions in case of some devices. One of the earliest known docks is at Lothal (2400 BCE), located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt. Modern oceanographers have observed that the Harappans must have possessed knowledge relating to tides in order to build such a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati, as well as exemplary hydrography and maritime engineering.Rao, 27‚Äì28 Excavations at Balakot (c. 2500‚Äì1900 BCE), present day Pakistan, have yielded evidence of an early furnace. The furnace was most likely used for the manufacturing of ceramic objects.Dales, 3‚Äì22 [10] Ovens, dating back to the civilization's mature phase (c. 2500‚Äì1900 BCE), were also excavated at Balakot. The Kalibangan archeological site further yields evidence of potshaped hearths, which at one site have been found both on ground and underground.Baber, 20 Kilns with fire and kiln chambers have also been found at the Kalibangan site. Vaishali. One of the edicts of Ashoka (272‚Äì231 BCE) reads: \\"Everywhere King Piyadasi (Ashoka) erected two kinds of hospitals, hospitals for people and hospitals for animals. Where there were no healing herbs for people and animals, he ordered that they be bought and planted.\\"Finger, 12 Based on archaeological and textual evidence, Joseph E. Schwartzberg (2008)‚Äîa University of Minnesota professor emeritus of geography‚Äîtraces the origins of Indian cartography to the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2500‚Äì1900 BCE). The use of large scale constructional plans, cosmological drawings, and cartographic material was known in India with some regularity since the Vedic period (2nd ‚Äì 1st millennium BCE).\\"We now believe that some form of mapping was practiced in what is now India as early as the Mesolithic period, that surveying dates as far back as the Indus Civilization (ca. 2500‚Äì1900 BCE), and that the construction of large-scale plans, cosmographic maps, and other cartographic works has occurred continuously at least since the late Vedic age (first millennium BCE)\\" ‚Äî Joseph E. Schwartzberg, 1301. Climatic conditions were responsible for the destruction of most of the evidence, however, a number of excavated surveying instruments and measuring rods have yielded convincing evidence of early cartographic activity.Schwartzberg, 1301‚Äì1302 Schwartzberg (2008)‚Äîon the subject of surviving maps‚Äîfurther holds that: 'Though not numerous, a number of map-like graffiti appear among the thousands of Stone Age Indian cave paintings; and at least one complex Mesolithic diagram is believed to be a representation of the cosmos.'Schwartzberg, 1301 Archeological evidence of an animal-drawn plough dates back to 2500 BCE in the Indus Valley Civilization.Lal (2001) The earliest available swords of copper discovered from the Harappan sites date back to 2300 BCE. Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings throughout the Ganges‚ÄìJamuna Doab region of India, consisting of bronze but more commonly copper.Allchin, 111‚Äì112 Early kingdoms Carbon pigment Ink, called masi, and popularly known as India ink was an admixture of several chemical components, has been used in India since at least the 4th century BCE.Banerji, 673 The practice of writing with ink and a sharp pointed needle was common in early South India.Sircar, 62 Several Jain sutras in India were compiled in Carbon pigment Ink.Sircar, 67 The Hindu-Arabic numeral system. The inscriptions on the edicts of Ashoka (1st millennium BCE) display this number system being used by the Imperial Mauryas. The religious texts of the Vedic Period provide evidence for the use of large numbers. By the time of the last Veda, the ' (1200‚Äì900 BCE), numbers as high as 10^{12} were being included in the texts.Hayashi, 360‚Äì361 For example, the mantra (sacrificial formula) at the end of the annahoma (\\"food-oblation rite\\") performed during the a≈õvamedha (\\"an allegory for a horse sacrifice\\"), and uttered just before-, during-, and just after sunrise, invokes powers of ten from a hundred to a trillion. The Satapatha Brahmana (9th century BCE) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the Sulba Sutras.Seidenberg, 301‚Äì342 Baudhayana (c. 8th century BCE) composed the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra, which contains examples of simple Pythagorean triples, such as: (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), (7, 24, 25), and (12, 35, 37)Joseph, 229 as well as a statement of the Pythagorean theorem for the sides of a square: \\"The rope which is stretched across the diagonal of a square produces an area double the size of the original square.\\" It also contains the general statement of the Pythagorean theorem (for the sides of a rectangle): \\"The rope stretched along the length of the diagonal of a rectangle makes an area which the vertical and horizontal sides make together.\\" Baudhayana gives a formula for the square root of two.Cooke, 200 Mesopotamian influence at this stage is considered likely. The earliest Indian astronomical text‚Äînamed ' and attributed to Lagadha‚Äîis considered one of the oldest astronomical texts, dating from 1400‚Äì1200 BCE (with the extant form possibly from 700‚Äì600 BCE), it details several astronomical attributes generally applied for timing social and religious events. It also details astronomical calculations, calendrical studies, and establishes rules for empirical observation.Subbaarayappa, 25‚Äì41 Since the ' is a religious text, it has connections with Indian astrology and details several important aspects of the time and seasons, including lunar months, solar months, and their adjustment by a lunar leap month of AdhikamƒÅsa.Tripathi, 264‚Äì267 Ritus and Yugas are also described. Tripathi (2008) holds that \\"Twenty-seven constellations, eclipses, seven planets, and twelve signs of the zodiac were also known at that time.\\" The Egyptian Papyrus of Kahun (1900 BCE) and literature of the Vedic period in India offer early records of veterinary medicine.Thrusfield, 2 Kearns & Nash (2008) state that mention of leprosy is described in the medical treatise Sushruta Samhita (6th century BCE). The Sushruta Samhita an Ayurvedic text contains 184 chapters and description of 1120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, a detailed study on Anatomy, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources.Dwivedi & Dwivedi (2007)Kearns & Nash (2008) However, The Oxford Illustrated Companion to Medicine holds that the mention of leprosy, as well as ritualistic cures for it, were described in the Hindu religious book Atharva-veda, written in 1500‚Äì1200 BCE.Lock etc., 420 Cataract surgery was known to the physician Sushruta (6th century BCE).Finger, 66 Traditional cataract surgery was performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka, a curved needle used to loosen the lens and push the cataract out of the field of vision. The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged. Though this method was successful, Susruta cautioned that it should only be used when necessary. The removal of cataract by surgery was also introduced into China from India.Lade & Svoboda, 85 During the 5th century BCE, the scholar PƒÅ·πáini had made several discoveries in the fields of phonetics, phonology, and morphology.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), Linguistics. PƒÅ·πáini's morphological analysis remained more advanced than any equivalent Western theory until the mid-20th century. Metal currency was minted in India before the 5th century BCE,Dhavalikar, 330‚Äì338Sellwood (2008) with coinage (400 BCE‚Äì100 CE) being made of silver and copper, bearing animal and plant symbols on them.Allan & Stern (2008) Zinc mines of Zawar, near Udaipur, Rajasthan, were active during 400 BCE.Craddock (1983)Arun Kumar Biswas, \\"The primacy of India in ancient brass and zinc metallurgy\\", Indian J History of Science, 28(4) (1993) page 309‚Äì330; and \\"Brass and zinc metallurgy in the ancient and medieval world: India's primacy and the technology transfer to the west\\", Indian J History of Science, 41(2) (2006) 159‚Äì174 Diverse specimens of swords have been discovered in Fatehgarh, where there are several varieties of hilt.F.R. Allchin, 111‚Äì112 These swords have been variously dated to periods between 1700‚Äì1400 BCE, but were probably used more extensively during the opening centuries of the 1st millennium BCE.Allchin, 114 Archaeological sites in such as Malhar, Dadupur, Raja Nala Ka Tila and Lahuradewa in present-day Uttar Pradesh show iron implements from the period between 1800 BCE and 1200 BCE.Tewari (2003) Early iron objects found in India can be dated to 1400 BCE by employing the method of radio carbon dating.Ceccarelli, 218 Some scholars believe that by the early 13th century BCE iron smelting was practiced on a bigger scale in India, suggesting that the date of the technology's inception may be placed earlier. In Southern India (present day Mysore) iron appeared as early as 11th to 12th centuries BCE. These developments were too early for any significant close contact with the northwest of the country.Drakonoff, 372 Middle Kingdoms (230 BCE ‚Äì 1206 CE) The iron pillar of Delhi (375‚Äì413 CE). The first iron pillar was the Iron pillar of Delhi, erected at the times of Chandragupta II Vikramaditya. The Arthashastra of Kautilya mentions the construction of dams and bridges.Dikshitar, pg. 332 The use of suspension bridges using plaited bamboo and iron chain was visible by about the 4th century.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), suspension bridge. The stupa, the precursor of the pagoda and torii, was constructed by the 3rd century BCE.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), Pagoda.Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System (2001), torii. Rock-cut step wells in the region date from 200‚Äì400 CE. Subsequently, the construction of wells at Dhank (550‚Äì625 CE) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850‚Äì950 CE) took place.Livingston & Beach, xxiii During the 1st millennium BCE, the Vaisheshika school of atomism was founded. The most important proponent of this school was Kanada, an Indian philosopher who lived around 600 BCE.Oliver Leaman, Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy. Routledge, 1999, page 269. The school proposed that atoms are indivisible and eternal, can neither be created nor destroyed, and that each one possesses its own distinct (individuality). It was further elaborated on by the Buddhist school of atomism, of which the philosophers Dharmakirti and DignƒÅga in the 7th century CE were the most important proponents. They considered atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy.(Stcherbatsky 1962 (1930). Vol. 1. P. 19) By the beginning of the Common Era glass was being used for ornaments and casing in the region. Contact with the Greco-Roman world added newer techniques, and local artisans learnt methods of glass molding, decorating and coloring by the early centuries of the Common Era.Ghosh, 219 The Satavahana period further reveals short cylinders of composite glass, including those displaying a lemon yellow matrix covered with green glass.\\"Ornaments, Gems etc.\\" (Ch. 10) in Ghosh 1990. Wootz originated in the region before the beginning of the common era.Srinivasan & Ranganathan Wootz was exported and traded throughout Europe, China, the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East, where it became known as Damascus steel. Archaeological evidence suggests that manufacturing process for Wootz was also in existence in South India before the Christian era.Srinivasan (1994)Srinivasan & Griffiths Evidence for using bow-instruments for carding comes from India (2nd century CE).Baber, 57 The mining of diamonds and its early use as gemstones originated in India.Wenk, 535‚Äì539 Golconda served as an important early center for diamond mining and processing. Diamonds were then exported to other parts of the world. Early reference to diamonds comes from Sanskrit texts.MSN Encarta (2007), Diamond. Archived 2009-10-31. The Arthashastra also mentions diamond trade in the region.Lee, 685 The Iron pillar of Delhi was erected at the times of Chandragupta II Vikramaditya (375‚Äì413), which stood without rusting for around 2 millennium.Balasubramaniam, R., 2002 The Rasaratna Samuccaya (800) explains the existence of two types of ores for zinc metal, one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose.Craddock, 13Model of a Chola (200‚Äì848) ship's hull, built by the ASI, based on a wreck 19 miles off the coast of Poombuhar, displayed in a Museum in Tirunelveli. The origins of the spinning wheel are unclear but India is one of the probable places of its origin.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia (2007), spinning wheel.Encyclopeedia Britnnica (2008). spinning. The device certainly reached Europe from India by the 14th century.MSN Encarta (2008), Spinning. Archived 2009-10-31. The cotton gin was invented in India as a mechanical device known as charkhi, the \\"wooden-worm-worked roller\\".Baber, 57 This mechanical device was, in some parts of the region, driven by water power. The Ajanta Caves yield evidence of a single roller cotton gin in use by the 5th century.Baber, 56 This cotton gin was used until further innovations were made in form of foot powered gins. Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647, for obtaining technology for sugar-refining.Kieschnick, 258 Each mission returned with different results on refining sugar. Pingala (300‚Äì200 BCE) was a musical theorist who authored a Sanskrit treatise on prosody. There is evidence that in his work on the enumeration of syllabic combinations, Pingala stumbled upon both the Pascal triangle and Binomial coefficients, although he did not have knowledge of the Binomial theorem itself.Fowler, 11Singh, 623‚Äì624 A description of binary numbers is also found in the works of Pingala.Sanchez & Canton, 37 The Indians also developed the use of the law of signs in multiplication. Negative numbers and the subtrahend had been used in East Asia since the 2nd century BCE, and Indian mathematicians were aware of negative numbers by the 7th century CE,Smith (1958), page 258 and their role in mathematical problems of debt was understood.Bourbaki (1998), page 49 Although the Indians were not the first to use the subtrahend, they were the first to establish the \\"law of signs\\" with regards to the multiplication of positive and negative numbers, which did not appear in East Asian texts until 1299.Smith (1958), page 257‚Äì258 Mostly consistent and correct rules for working with negative numbers were formulated, and the diffusion of these rules led the Arab intermediaries to pass it on to Europe. A decimal number system using hieroglyphics dates back to 3000 BC in Egypt,Georges Ifrah: From One to Zero. A Universal History of Numbers, Penguin Books, 1988, , pp. 200‚Äì213 (Egyptian Numerals) and was later in use in ancient India where the modern numeration system was developed.Ifrah, 346 By the 9th century CE, the Hindu‚ÄìArabic numeral system was transmitted from India through the Middle East and to the rest of the world. The concept of 0 as a number, and not merely a symbol for separation is attributed to India.Bourbaki, 46 In India, practical calculations were carried out using zero, which was treated like any other number by the 9th century CE, even in case of division.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia (2007). algebra Brahmagupta (598‚Äì668) was able to find (integral) solutions of Pell's equation.Stillwell, 72‚Äì73 Conceptual design for a perpetual motion machine by Bhaskara II dates to 1150. He described a wheel that he claimed would run forever.Lynn Townsend White, Jr. The trigonometric functions of sine and versine, from which it was trivial to derive the cosine, were used by the mathematician, Aryabhata, in the late 5th century.O'Connor, J. J. & Robertson, E.F. (1996)\\"Geometry, and its branch trigonometry, was the mathematics Indian astronomers used most frequently. In fact, the Indian astronomers in the third or fourth century, using a pre-Ptolemaic Greek table of chords, produced tables of sines and versines, from which it was trivial to derive cosines. This new system of trigonometry, produced in India, was transmitted to the Arabs in the late eighth century and by them, in an expanded form, to the Latin West and the Byzantine East in the twelfth century\\" ‚Äì Pingree (2003). The calculus theorem now known as \\"Rolle's theorem\\" was stated by mathematician, BhƒÅskara II, in the 12th century.Broadbent, 307‚Äì308 Akbarnama‚Äîwritten by August 12, 1602‚Äîdepicts the defeat of Baz Bahadur of Malwa by the Mughal troops, 1561. The Mughals extensively improved metal weapons and armor used by the armies of India. Indigo was used as a dye in India, which was also a major center for its production and processing.Kriger & Connah, 120 The Indigofera tinctoria variety of Indigo was domesticated in India. Indigo, used as a dye, made its way to the Greeks and the Romans via various trade routes, and was valued as a luxury product. The cashmere wool fiber, also known as pashm or pashmina, was used in the handmade shawls of Kashmir.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), cashmere.

Muslin was named after the city where Europeans first encountered it, Mosul, in what is now Iraq, but the fabric actually originated from Dhaka in what is now Bangladesh.Ahmad, 5‚Äì26 In the 9th century, an Arab merchant named Sulaiman makes note of the material's origin in Bengal (known as Ruhml in Arabic). European scholar Francesco Lorenzo Pull√® reproduced a number of Indian maps in his magnum opus La Cartografia Antica dell India.Sircar 328 Out of these maps, two have been reproduced using a manuscript of Lokaprakasa, originally compiled by the polymath Ksemendra (Kashmir, 11th century CE), as a source. The other manuscript, used as a source by Francesco I, is titled Samgraha'. Samarangana Sutradhara, a Sanskrit treatise by Bhoja (11th century), includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances (automata), including mechanical bees and birds, fountains shaped like humans and animals, and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps, danced, played instruments, and re-enacted scenes from Hindu mythology.  Late Medieval and Early Modern periods (1206‚Äì1858 CE)  Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340 ‚Äì 1425) and his Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics developed and founded mathematical analysis. The infinite series for œÄ was stated by him, and he made use of the series expansion of \\\\arctan x to obtain an infinite series expression, now known as the Madhava-Gregory series, for \\\\pi. Their rational approximation of the error for the finite sum of their series are of particular interest. They manipulated the error term to derive a faster converging series for \\\\pi. They used the improved series to derive a rational expression, 104348/33215 for \\\\pi correct up to nine decimal places, i.e. 3.141592653 (of 3.1415926535897...).Roy, 291‚Äì306 The development of the series expansions for trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and arc tangent) was carried out by mathematicians of the Kerala School in the 15th century CE. Their work, completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe, provided what is now considered the first example of a power series (apart from geometric series).Stillwell, 173 Shƒìr ShƒÅh of northern India issued silver currency bearing Islamic motifs, later imitated by the Mughal empire. The Chinese merchant Ma Huan (1413‚Äì51) noted that gold coins, known as fanam, were issued in Cochin and weighed a total of one fen and one li according to the Chinese standards.Chaudhuri, 223 They were of fine quality and could be exchanged in China for 15 silver coins of four-li weight each.alt= In 1500, Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, in his Tantrasangraha, revised Aryabhata's elliptical model for the planets Mercury and Venus. His equation of the centre for these planets remained the most accurate until the time of Johannes Kepler in the 17th century.Joseph, George G. (2000), The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Penguin Books, . The seamless celestial globe was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 998 AH (1589‚Äì90 CE), and twenty other such globes were later produced in Lahore and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams, even with modern technology. These Mughal metallurgists pioneered the method of lost-wax casting in order to produce these globes.Savage-Smith (1985) Gunpowder and gunpowder weapons were transmitted to India through the Mongol invasions of India. The Mongols were defeated by Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, and some of the Mongol soldiers remained in northern India after their conversion to Islam. It was written in the Tarikh-i Firishta (1606‚Äì1607) that the envoy of the Mongol ruler Hulagu Khan was presented with a pyrotechnics display upon his arrival in Delhi in 1258 CE.Khan, 9‚Äì10 As a part of an embassy to India by Timurid leader Shah Rukh (1405‚Äì1447), 'Abd al-Razzaq mentioned naphtha-throwers mounted on elephants and a variety of pyrotechnics put on display.Partington, 217 Firearms known as top-o-tufak also existed in the Vijayanagara Empire by as early as 1366 CE. From then on the employment of gunpowder warfare in the region was prevalent, with events such as the siege of Belgaum in 1473 CE by the Sultan Muhammad Shah Bahmani.Khan, 10Jantar Mantar, Delhi‚Äîconsisting of 13 architectural astronomy instruments, built by Jai Singh II of Jaipur, from 1724 onwards. In A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder, James Riddick Partington describes the gunpowder warfare of 16th and 17th century Mughal India, and writes that \\"Indian war rockets were formidable weapons before such rockets were used in Europe. They had bamboo rods, a rocket-body lashed to the rod, and iron points. They were directed at the target and fired by lighting the fuse, but the trajectory was rather erratic... The use of mines and counter-mines with explosive charges of gunpowder is mentioned for the times of Akbar and JahƒÅngir.\\"Partington, 226 By the 16th century, Indians were manufacturing a diverse variety of firearms; large guns in particular, became visible in Tanjore, Dacca, Bijapur and Murshidabad.Partington, 225 Guns made of bronze were recovered from Calicut (1504) and Diu (1533).Partington, 226 GujarƒÅt supplied Europe saltpeter for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), India. Bengal and MƒÅlwa participated in saltpeter production. The Dutch, French, Portuguese, and English used Chhapra as a center of saltpeter refining.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), ChƒÅpra. The construction of water works and aspects of water technology in India is described in Arabic and Persian works. During medieval times, the diffusion of Indian and Persian irrigation technologies gave rise to an advanced irrigation system which bought about economic growth and also helped in the growth of material culture.Siddiqui, 52‚Äì77 The founder of the cashmere wool industry is traditionally held to be the 15th-century ruler of Kashmir, Zayn-ul-Abidin, who introduced weavers from Central Asia. The scholar Sadiq Isfahani of Jaunpur compiled an atlas of the parts of the world which he held to be 'suitable for human life'.Schwartzberg, 1302 The 32 sheet atlas‚Äîwith maps oriented towards the south as was the case with Islamic works of the era‚Äîis part of a larger scholarly work compiled by Isfahani during 1647 CE. According to Joseph E. Schwartzberg (2008): 'The largest known Indian map, depicting the former Rajput capital at Amber in remarkable house-by-house detail, measures 661 √ó 645 cm.

Early volumes of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described cartographic charts made by the seafaring Dravidian people.Sircar 330 In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), Stephen Oliver Fought & John F. Guilmartin, Jr. describe the gunpowder technology in 18th-century Mysore:Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), rocket and missile system. Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, Tippu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British. By the end of the 18th century the postal system in the region had reached high levels of efficiency. According to Thomas Broughton, the Maharaja of Jodhpur sent daily offerings of fresh flowers from his capital to Nathadvara (320 km) and they arrived in time for the first religious Darshan at sunrise.Peabody, 71 Later this system underwent modernization with the establishment of the British Raj. The Post Office Act XVII of 1837 enabled the Governor-General of India to convey messages by post within the territories of the East India Company. Mail was available to some officials without charge, which became a controversial privilege as the years passed. The Indian Post Office service was established on October 1, 1837.Lowe, 134 The British also constructed a vast railway network in the region for both strategic and commercial reasons.Seaman, 348 The British education system, aimed at producing able civil and administrative services candidates, exposed a number of Indians to foreign institutions.Raja (2006) Jagadis Chandra Bose (1858‚Äì1937), Prafulla Chandra Ray (1861‚Äì1944), Satyendra Nath Bose (1894‚Äì1974), Meghnad Saha (1893‚Äì1956), P.

Extensive interaction between colonial and native sciences was seen during most of the colonial era.Arnold, 211 Western science came to be associated with the requirements of nation building rather than being viewed entirely as a colonial entity, especially as it continued to fuel necessities from agriculture to commerce. Scientists from India also appeared throughout Europe.Arnold, 212 By the time of India's independence colonial science had assumed importance within the westernized intelligentsia and establishment.

It is situated in the south-west of the country, bordering the Anseba region to the north, and the Maekel (Central) and Debub (Southern) regions to the east; the country of Sudan lies to the west and Ethiopia to the south. The capital of Gash-barka is Barentu. Other towns include Agordat (the former capital), Molki, Sebderat and Teseney. As of 2005, the region had a population of 708,800 compared to a population of 625,100 in 2001. The net growth rate was 11.81 per cent. The total area of the province was 33,200 km2 and the density was 21.35 persons per km2., making up roughly one-third of Eritrea. The region is dubbed as the \\"breadbasket\\" of the country as it is rich in agriculture. The region is also rich in marble, and other important minerals, including gold. In Augaro, there are some old mineshafts and machinery from the days when the Italians mined gold here. Geography Early morning in a Gash Barka village It is situated in the south-west of the country, bordering the Anseba region to the north, and the Maekel (Central) and Debub (Southern) regions to the east; the country of Sudan lies to the west and Ethiopia to the south. The major crops in the region are bananas, tomatoes, cotton, onions, millet, sesame, green pepper and sweet melon. Within the entire country there existed extensive forestation as recently as 1900 AD; however, there is less than one percent forested area present in the country, and this deforestation trend has been mirrored in the region. Most of Eritrea was previously habitat for the endangered painted hunting dog, Lycaon pictus; however, this canid is now deemed extirpated from Gash-Barka and all of Eritrea due to the expanding human population in this country. The topography of the region has highland plateau, which are cooler than the regions around the coastal plains. There are two rainy seasons, the heavier one during summer and the lighter one during spring. The climate and geography of the region along with other regions of Eritrea is similar to the one of Ethiopia. The average elevation in the region is around to . The hottest month is May recording temperatures up to , while the coldest month is December to February when it reaches freezing temperature. The region received around of rainfall and the soil is conducive for agriculture. Demographics As of 2005, the region had a population of 708,800 compared to a population of 625,100 in 2001. The net growth rate was 11.81 per cent. The total area of the province was 33,200 km2 and the density was 21.35 persons per km2. As of 2002, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), defined as the children per woman was 5.1. The General Fertility Rate (GFR), defined as the births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 45 remained at 168.0. The Crude Birth Rate (CBR), the number of births per 1,000 population, was 34.0. The percentage of women pregnant as of 2002 out of the total population was 10.2 per cent. The mean number of children ever born stood at 6.3. The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), defined as the number of deaths of children for every 1,000 born was 66.0 while the Child Mortality Rate (CMR), defined as the number of child deaths for every 1,000 children 5 years of age was 61.0. The under-5 mortality rate stood at 123.0. The number of children with the prevalence of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) was 1039, fever was 1039, and Diarrhea was 1039. The number of women with the knowledge of AIDS was 1,500 and the number of people with no knowledge of the disease or its prevention was 0.0 per cent. Education and economy Barentu As of 2002, the number of males completing or attending highest level of schooling in the region was 2,700 while it was 3,179 females. The per centage of literate males was 37.50 and the percentage of literate females was 22.00. A fraction of 61.70 males had no education, while the corresponding number for females was 74.20. The fraction of males completing secondary school stood at 0.80 and the fraction of males completing more than secondary was 001. The corresponding numbers for females was 0.40 and 000 respectively. As of 2002, the number of people engaged in Professional/technical/managerial activities was 4.00 per cent, Clerical was 2.70 per cent, Sales and services was 26.40 per cent, Skilled Manual was 14.00 per cent, Unskilled Manual was 0.80 per cent, Domestic Service was 8.90 per cent and Agriculture was 42.50 per cent. The total number of employed men was 2,150 and the total number of employed women was 2,012. The number of men who were paid their total earnings in cash was 59.10 per cent, in kind was 5.70 and in both was 22.90. The number of women who were paid their total earnings in cash was 81.90 per cent, in kind was 1.60 per cent and in both was 5.20 per cent. Administration The region also includes the following districts: Agordat City, Barentu City, Dghe, Forto, Gogne, Haykota, Logo Anseba, Mensura, Mogolo, Molki, Omhajer (Guluj), Shambuko, Tesseney and Upper Gash. Eritrea has a one party national Assembly governed by People‚Äôs Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) (originally Eritrean people's Liberation Front), an authoritarian government. From the time of independence since 24 May 1991, the country has been continuing with a transitional government elected during the elections in April 1993. The scheduled elections in 2001 has been postponed indefinitely. The regional and local elections are conducted on a periodic basis on a restricted framework. All men and women of any ethnic or religious background are eligible to vote. No parties or groups other than PFDJ are allowed to contest and the elections are presided by representatives from PDFJ. Policy decisions should be centered around the party mandate and opposition and dissenters have been imprisoned.

Its main objective is to obtain full documentation of the climatic and atmospheric record archived in Antarctic ice by drilling and analyzing two ice cores and comparing these with their Greenland counterparts (GRIP and GISP). Evaluation of these records will provide information about the natural climate variability and mechanisms of rapid climatic changes during the last glacial epoch. The European Science Foundation EPICA Programme (1996‚Äì2005) provides co-ordination for EPICA drilling activities at Dome Concordia and Kohnen Station, which are supported by the European Commission and by national contributions from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Deep drilling took place at two sites in Antarctica: Concordia Station at Dome C and Kohnen Station. In 2008 the project received the Descartes Prize for Research.ESF‚Äôs European ice core project EPICA receives prestigious Descartes Prize for Collaborative, Transnational Research ESF press release, 12 March 2008 Concordia Station at Dome C The EPICA and Vostok cores compared This site (, 3233 m above sea level, 560 km from Vostok Station) was chosen to obtain the longest undisturbed chronicle of environmental change, in order to characterise climate variability over several glacial cycles, and to study potential climate forcings and their relationship to events in other regions. The core goes back 740,000 years and reveals 8 previous glacial cycles. Drilling was completed at this site in December 2004, reaching a drilling depth of 3270.2 m, 5 m above bedrock. Present-day annual average air temperature is ‚àí54.5 ¬∞C and snow accumulation 25 mm/y. Information about the core was first published in Nature on 2004/June/10 . The picture shows delta deuterium data (a proxy for temperature: more negative values indicate lower temperatures) from both EPICA and Vostok. The upper plot, with x-axis being age (years before 1950) clearly shows the extra information in the EPICA core before the start of the Vostok record. The lower picture, plotted against depth, shows how compressed the deeper parts of the cores are: the earliest 100 kyr (thousand years) of the EPICA core are in the bottom 100 m of the core. Before 400 kyr the character of the ice ages are seen to be somewhat different: interglacial warmth is distinctly less than the four most recent interglacials, however, the interglacial periods before 400 kyr occupied a much larger proportion of each cycle than subsequently. The interglacial 400 kyr ago, which is believed (from arguments about the configuration of the orbital parameters of the earth) to be an approximate analogue to the current interglacial, was quite long: 28 kyr. The Nature paper argues that if this analogue is accepted, the current climate would be expected to continue like today's, in the absence of human influence (which it states is unlikely, given the predicted increases in greenhouse gas concentrations). Further analysis of the core is hoped to extend the record back somewhat further, possibly as far as the Brunhes‚ÄìMatuyama magnetic reversal, believed to be at about 780 kyr. The core time scale is derived from the measured depth scale by a model incorporating surface snow accumulation variations, ice thinning, basal heat fluxes etc., and is empirically \\"tied\\" at 4 times by matches to the marine isotopic record. Kohnen Station, Dronning Maud Land Kohnen Station is located at , 2892 m above sea level. Higher annual snowfall and sensitivity to conditions over the South Atlantic will allow the study of any links between shifts in the Atlantic Ocean circulation and the rapid climate events detected over Greenland.

Administration The region is divided into subregions; Berikh, Ghala Nefhi, North Eastern, North Western, Serejaka, South Eastern and South Western, while Asmara forms a separate administrative area. Other settlements within the Central Region include Himbirti, Emba Derho and Tsazega. The region's administrator is Major General Ramadan Osman Awliyai. Eritrea has a one party national Assembly governed by People‚Äôs Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) (originally Eritrean Liberation Front), an authoritarian government. From the time of independence since 30 May 1991, the country has been continuing with a transitional government elected during the elections in April 1993. The scheduled elections in 2001 has been postponed indefinitely. The regional and local elections are conducted on a periodic basis on a restricted framework. All men and women of any ethnic or religious background are eligible to vote. No parties or groups other than PFDJ are allowed to contest and the elections are presided by representatives from PDFJ. Policy decisions should be centered around the party mandate and opposition and dissenters have been imprisoned.

Mepal is part of the East Cambridgeshire district, and is located just north of the A142 road between Ely and Chatteris. History First recorded at the start of the 13th century Mepal's history has always been tied up with that of The Fens and the village is less than ten metres above sea level. One of the smaller villages of the Isle of Ely, Mepal lies at the western end of the Isle on what was once the shore between the fenland and the higher ground of the Isle.About Mepal The Old Bedford River and the New Bedford River (also known as the Hundred Foot Drain) run very close on the northwestern side of the village, and the only important bridges of the rivers are found in Mepal. The old and new rivers, originally modified by the Victorians, offer the main drainage route for the Fens and retain a major flood plain between the two river beds. The flood plain typically floods between November and March of each year. A major fire devastated the village in the 19th century, leading to a drop in population from 510 to 397 between 1861 and 1871. There are thus very few remaining buildings dating from before the 19th century. Listed as Mepahala at the start of the 13th century, the village's name means \\"Nook of land of a man called Meapa.\\" RAF Mepal Mepal retains the historical pride of being the home of 75 Squadron RAF, which was operational between 1943 and 1945. It held the enviable post of being the prior home to No. 75 'New Zealand' Squadron which was equipped with Lancasters. 75 Sqn flew the highest total operations for the whole of RAF Bomber Command, 8017 in total. Mepal is visited on an annual basis by previous members of the Squadron and their families, as part of remembrance.Mepal: Bomber Command A museum jointly dedicated to RAF Mepal and RAF Witchford is located in the nearby village of Witchford. Church Mepal church The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, dates from the 13th century and has been largely unaltered since. It is notable as the only church in the Isle of Ely without either tower or spire. Village life The village of Mepal retains a pub (The Three Pickerels), a post office and a primary school. Former public houses include the Cross Keys, in which Clement Freud lived when he was Member of Parliament for the Isle of Ely in the 1970s and early 1980s. From Monday to Saturday Mepal has a two-hourly bus service (no Sunday service) to Chatteris, Ely and Cambridge.  Botanical  Adjacent to St Mary's church is a small woodland notable for the old elm trees, believed to be Plot elm hybrid.

(15,2 m.) high and 120 ft. (36,5 m.) wide, and weighing 300 tons. Built in the 1980s, it is housed in Dr. Evermor's Art Park on Highway 12, in the town of Sumpter, in Sauk County, Wisconsin, United States. The sculpture incorporates two Thomas Edison dynamos from the 1880s, lightning rods, high-voltage components from 1920s power plants, scrap from the nearby Badger Army Ammunition Plant, and the decontamination chamber from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Its creator, Tom Every (1938 - 2020)https://www.smallmuseumfolkart.org/artists/dr-evermor-tom- every/, was born in Brooklyn, Wisconsin and was a demolition expert who spent decades collecting antique machinery for the sculpture and the surrounding fiction that justifies it. According to Every, Dr. Evermor was a Victorian inventor who designed the Forevertron to launch himself, \\"into the heavens on a magnetic lightning force beam.\\" The Forevertron, despite its size and weight, was designed to be relocatable to a different site‚Äîthe sculpture is built in sections that are connected by bolts and pins. In addition to the Forevertron itself, the sculpture includes a tea house gazebo from which Every says: \\"Queen Victoria and Prince Albert may observe the launching of Dr. Evermor; it also includes a giant telescope where skeptics may observe the ascent.\\" Dr. Evermor's art park is home to a large number of other sculptures, many of which relate to the Forevertron, such as the \\"Celestial Listening Ear\\" and the \\"Overlord Master Control Tower\\". Other large-scale sculptures include gigantic insects (the \\"Juicer Bug\\" and \\"Arachna Artie\\"), the \\"Epicurean\\" bellows-driven barbecue train, \\"The Dragon\\", and \\"The UFO\\". The most numerous sculptures are the \\"Bird Band and Orchestra\\" which includes nearly 70 birds ranging from the size of a child to twenty feet tall, all made from scrap industrial parts, geological survey markers, knives, loudspeakers, springs, and musical instruments, among other salvaged materials. Every related that he took pride in allowing the original materials to remain unaltered as much as possible, using their original forms in new juxtapositions to create his aesthetic. Although Every has now passed, tours of the art park site can generally be accessed from passing through the surplus store adjacent to it, Delaney's Surplus. Mr. Every also created much of the installation art for the House on the Rock, including the world's largest carousel.

Background Pennie began playing drums at the age of 13, and at age 16 decided to pursue music seriously. He grew up in Randolph, New Jersey and graduated from Randolph High School, and spent two years at Berklee College of Music where he received a diploma in Music Synthesis, which focuses on electronic music composition and manipulation.Staff. \\"Chris Pennie\\" , Sick Drummer Magazine, August 30, 2006. Accessed September 21, 2015. \\"After graduating from Randolph High School in 1995, Chris attended Berklee College of music in Boston Massachusetts, where he majored in music synthesis.\\" Influences and legacy Pennie has cited drummers Lars Ulrich and Stewart Copeland as his main early influences. In regard to his current playing, Sean Reinert is one of his biggest inspirations. He has also emphasized on several occasions that listening to and playing a diverse assortment of music has been an integral part in developing his style, noting such eclectic influences as 1970s jazz-rock fusion group Mahavishnu Orchestra, technical metal bands Meshuggah, Cynic, and electronic-influenced groups such as Nine Inch Nails and DJ Shadow. Many drummers have cited Pennie as an influence or expressed admiration for his work, including Brann Dailor, Richard Christy of Death, Peter Wildoer, Dave Witte, Tyshawn Sorey, Charlie Zeleny, Dan Searle of Architects, Andy Dalton of See You Next Tuesday, J. R.

Bands While in high school he was playing in the local New Jersey based band, Prozak. The other 3 members of Prozak were 8‚Äì10 years Pennie's senior, and in order for Prozak to play the local bars and clubs, Pennie's father would accompany him to the various gigs. Chris played with Prozak from 1993 until he began attending Berklee School of Music in 1995. He recorded ten songs with Prozak during his time with the band but they were never commercially released. Pennie also spent time with the pop-punk group Boxer. Formed in 1995 with another Berklee graduate, Jeremy McDowell, they became the first band to be signed to the now famous Vagrant Records. They released one album, The Hurt Process, in 1998, and broke up in late 1999. Pennie also recorded drums for his former tourmates in experimental metalcore group All Else Failed on their 2004 album This Never Happened. Pennie describes his band, The Dillinger Escape Plan, as being 'mathcore' where they start each song with no structure and an open palette. He and guitarist Ben Weinman, along with now-departed singer Dimitri Minakakis and bass guitarist Adam Doll, formed Dillinger Escape Plan in March 1997. He and Ben Weinman wrote the majority of Dillinger's material and Pennie called Weinman his \\"musical soulmate\\". Pennie also took care of a lot of the electronic influence in the band's material in the studio as well as onstage, triggering effects and loops with footswitch pedals. Chris became frustrated with The Dillinger Escape Plan, in particular with Ben Weinman. Pennie had previously turned down the Nine Inch Nails job because The Dillinger Escape Plan was 'his baby' but wasn't willing to turn down Coheed and Cambria because of his frustrations with Weinman and subsequently left Dillinger. Chris began working in the studio with rock band Coheed and Cambria, because the drummer Josh Eppard had left the band. Due to contractual obligations, Pennie was not allowed to record for Coheed's 2007 album Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow. Instead, the band recruited Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins for the task. On June 28, 2007, Coheed and Cambria announced on their Myspace that Chris Pennie joined the band. On November 2, 2011, Coheed and Cambria announced on their Facebook page that Pennie had left the band. Chris also announced he had parted ways with Coheed and Cambria, in order to focus on other projects such as Return to Earth and Fight Mannequins. Current projects Pennie has lent his talent to the predominantly electronic band Idiot Pilot on their 2007 album Wolves. MTV reported: \\"the Dillinger Escape Plan's Chris Pennie appears on the album, augmenting several of Wolves' tracks with his drumming prowess.

The major difference is that higher impulse range motors are used. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) definition of a high-power rocket is one that has a total weight of more than and contains a motor or motors containing more than of propellant and/or rated at more than 160 Newton-seconds (40.47 lbf¬∑s) of total impulse, or that uses a motor with an average thrust of or more. Types High-power rockets are defined as rockets flown using commercially available motors ranging from H to O class. In the U.S., the NFPA1122 standard dictates guidelines for model rocketry, while NFPA1127 is specific to high-power rockets. In most U.S. states NFPA1122 has been adopted as part of the legal code. A smaller number of states use NFPA1127. Associations A high-power rocket lifting off. The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry are the major sanctioning bodies for the hobby in the US, providing member certifications, and criteria for general safety guidelines. In most other countries, where HPR is supported, the regulations are similar to or derived from the Tripoli Rocket Association Safety CodeTRA Safety Code and the NAR High-power Certification system.NAR High-power Certification In Australia, there are two nationwide HPR organizations. The Australian Model Rocket Society Inc. is the premiere representative body for rocketry which advocates for its various member groups and exists to serve the broader rocketry community. The Tripoli Rocketry Association has three prefectures in Australia, with launch sites in Victoria, New South Wales, and the ACT. In Canada, the Canadian Association of Rocketry - L'Association Canadienne De Fus√©ologie is appointed as regulator for the hobby. In New Zealand, the controlling body for rocketry is the New Zealand Rocketry Association or NZRA In South Africa, the controlling body for rocketry is the Rocketry Organization of South Africa or Rocketry SA. In the UK the British Model Flying Association or BMFA is the governing body with United Kingdom Rocketry Association or UKRA acting as the High Power Association for Motor flights classed as H and above. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Interessengemeinschaft Modellraketen has an approved HPR certification program which is cross-recognized by NAR, CAR and UKRA.IMR Highpower Certification Certification =Certification in the USA & Canada= Unlike model rocketry, certification is required by the governing organizations in order for individuals to fly high-powered rockets. The certification system is standardized across the hobby and governing organizations. There are three levels of certification, each allowing the user to fly successively larger motors. In the USA (TRA and NAR): Level 1: H, I Level 2: J, K, L Level 3: M, N, O and beyond Note: In Canada, the Canadian Association of RocketryCAR certification process has an additional step to Level 4, which is equivalent to the US Level 3. Level 1 is H motor, Level 2 is I motor and CAR Level 3 and 4 is the same as U.S. Level 2 and 3, respectively. Due to a change by the Board of Directors upon recommendation from the RSO Committee, all hybrids are considered High Power. In order to gain certification an individual needs to demonstrate his ability to fly a rocket within the given power range of the level he is seeking successfully. For example, if an individual desires to gain a Level 1 certification he must successfully fly an H-I motor in an appropriately sized rocket and retrieve it successfully in a condition suitable to launch it again safely. This is also true for Level 2 and 3 certification with the added requirements that, for Level 2 a written test be successfully passed and for Level 3 the build be documented and overseen by two designated technical authorities called TAPs (Technical Advisory Panel) who are themselves Level 3 certified and notably proficient at rocketry. The level 3 technical authorities are authorized by the respective Tripoli or NAR national organizations. These requirements vary slightly between NAR and Tripoli, but are very close in both organizations. The above rocket motor impulse levels would all be classified as Class 2 rockets per the US Federal Code of Federal Regulations CFR Title 14 Aeronautics and Space, Part 101, Subpart C, 101.22 Definitions: ‚Äú(b) Class 2‚ÄîHigh-Power Rocket means an amateur rocket other than a model rocket that is propelled by a motor or motors having a combined total impulse of 40,960 Newton-seconds (9,208 pound-seconds) or less. (c) Class 3‚ÄîAdvanced High-Power Rocket means an amateur rocket other than a model rocket or high-power rocket\\". Tripoli Rocketry Association maintains a Class 3 review committee who voluntarily (not required by the FAA) review rockets with altitudes expecting to reach or exceed 50,000 feet and as a pre-check for rocket projects that will be submitted to the FAA as a class 3 project. The Class 3 review committee performs the following functions: * Performing a 3-sigma, 6-degree of freedom dispersion analysis on submitted projects. * Providing guidance and a review of the Class 3 waiver application package prior to FAA submittal. * Working with the FAA/AST to educate applicants and FAA personnel to the needs of Class 3 project teams in maintaining the viability and safety of the hobby now and in the future. * To work toward achieving a more efficient and meaningful opportunity for members to pursue Class 3 and beyond flight attempts. So under the US rules rockets larger than 40,960 Newton-seconds (total impulse more than an O-class) can be launched, but are classified as Class 3 rockets and require individual approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. The class 3 approval is fairly involved necessitating 6-degree of freedom dispersion analysis for the returning rocket, a documentation of launch/ no-launch criteria among other things. Rockets with a total impulse of up to S (at least 327,680 Newton- seconds) have been launched by amateurs under the class-3 rules. Between the two US certifying entities NAR and Tripoli, there is reciprocity. For example, a Level 2 certified NAR member can be recognized by Tripoli as a Level 2 as both certifying entities are simply enforcing the same NFPA (National Fire Protection Act) and FAA/CFR regulations. Achieving dual certification would require paying dues to both entities. Between NAR and Tripoli the primary differences are: NAR tends to focus more on model rockery and contests. It appeals to children, scouting groups and novelty launches like hang-time and egg tosses. Tripoli's focus is geared more toward higher power, experimental and advanced rocketry. Tripoli for example encourages experimental (EX) or ammonium-perchlorate based non-commercial individually manufactured rocket motors for Level 2 and above certified fliers as well as hybrid motors (for example nitrous oxide gaseous oxidizer and solid rubber fuel). Tripoli also has active mentoring programs with many engineering programs of US universities and as above supports the exploration of the hard science of and limitations of rocketry by educated private citizens including class-3 rocketry. The non-NASA private spaceflight companies are launching what are classified as Class 3 rockets and above. At least one current employee of Space-X obtained his experience flying high powered rockets with the Tripoli Houston prefecture of the national organization as a university student enrolled in the engineering program of a local university. =Certification in the United Kingdom= The UKRA offer a certification program in the UK similar to the US, but limited to O. The process is very similar to that of the USA. Level 1 : H, I Level 2 : J, K, L Level 3 : M, N, O Range Safety Officer (RSO) The requirements for level 1 certification are a successful test flight with a level 1 size motor in front of a UKRA certified RSO. A level 2 certificate requires a successful test flight with a level 2 sized motor witnessed by an RSO. The candidate also has to pass a multiple choice written exam set by the UKRA. A level 3 candidate has to submit a detailed written report on their rocket to the UKRA Safety and Technical Committee, who will also examine the rocket prior to launch. After the written report has been approved and the rocket inspected, the candidate must then complete a successful test flight to obtain his level 3 certification. Any UKRA member can apply to be a Range Safety Officer. The candidate must pass the level 2 written exam and pass an interview. An RSO can be either a Model Rocket RSO, Level 1 RSO, Level 2 RSO or Level 3 RSO, depending on the certification level he holds. The RSO can only act at launches involving rockets of his level of certification or lower. Third party indemnity insurance is only provided by the British Model Flying Association (BMFA) and is included as part of the membership package. High Power Rocket fliers must hold the appropriate certificate for the size of motor that they are flying, and abide by the UKRA safety rules, for insurance to be valid. The UKRA recognize the certification from the following National Organisations, who also recognize the UKRA certifications. * Interessengemeinschaft Modellraketen e.V. (IMR) * National Association of Rocketry (NAR) * Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA) * Canadian Association of Rocketry (CAR) =Certification in Australia= May be done through the following associations. Australian Rocketry Association INC and its member clubs. The Tripoli Rocketry Association offers High Power Rocketry (HPR) certification to all Australians and is recognised internationally. It is the only truly international rocketry association in Australia and is the only rocketry association fully insured internationally. Samantha Ridgway, first TRA L3 in Australia. The Australian Model Rocket Society Inc. offers High Power Rocketry (HPR) certification based on the NAR and TRA systems and recognises TRA, CAR, NAR, and UKRA certifications. Samantha Ridgway was the first woman TRA Cert III Rocketeer in Australia. She flew the rocket she designed and built, named Lucky 7 on an M1500 Rocket Motor. =Certification in South Africa= Rocketry SA offer a certification programme in South Africa with similar processes and procedures to those of the US and UK. Level 1 : H, I Level 2 : J, K, L Level 3 : M, N, O In order to gain certification an individual needs to demonstrate his ability to successfully build, launch and recover a rocket within the given power range of the level he/she is seeking. Construction High-power rocket designs can vary widely as do anticipated altitudes and performance, but altitudes of and velocities in the supersonic ranges are not uncommon. A combination of (often) larger mass and higher apogees may require sophisticated recovery systems. High-power rockets are frequently flown with sophisticated electronic devices used for recording flight data (altitude, velocity, acceleration/deceleration, G-forces) and for deploying recovery methods or devices.A high-power rocket being set up before flight High-power rockets are constructed from materials such as phenolic resin, fiberglass, carbon fiber, and other composite materials and plastics. Motor casings are normally machined aluminium with ablative phenolic or paper liners and are reloadable, i.e. can be used multiple times. Propulsion High-power rockets are predominantly powered by commercially available APCP- based motors or nitrous oxide-based hybrid motors. Motors for High-Power Rocketry are \\"H\\" and above. The lettered naming system is a standard in the hobby in which successive letters double the delivered impulse of the previous letter. Each letter also has a range of impulses under which a given motor can be classified. Obtaining rocket motors in the United Kingdom Black powder motors, typically manufactured by companies such as Estes and Quest are classed as fireworks, and subject to few purchase restrictions in the UK, the main restriction being the purchaser must be over 18 years old. The motors are available up to class D in the UK and only suitable for low power model rockets. Ammonium Perchlorate is classed as an explosive by the UK Health and Safety Executive, so Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant (AP) motors formerly required the purchaser to have an Explosives Licence and Recipient Competent Authority Transfer Document (RCA). A Registered Store Certificate was also required if the purchaser wanted to store the motors rather than purchase them at the flying event and use them immediately. The UKRA has negotiated an exemption so that model rocket fliers can obtain some AP motors in limited quantities without the need for an explosives licence. Since 4 December 2007, model rocketeers have been able to purchase AP motors with a net weight less than 1 kg of propellant without an Explosives Licence. They can also store motors up to a total net weight of 5 kg without needing an Explosives Licence or Registered Store Certificate. They will still require an RCA document. This can be obtained from the UK HSE by writing an appropriate letter to them requesting an exemption for model rocket motors. This document is currently issued free of charge, although this may change. A motor with of propellant is a K impulse motor, so model rocketeers can now fly level 2 models without the need for an explosives license, however an RCA is still required. This relaxation in the regulations has made mid and high power rocketry much more accessible in the UK. Recovery A typical altimeter- based deployment bay. In model rocketry, a parachute, streamer or other recovery device or method deploys at apogee, but high-power rockets may employ more complex recovery systems since altitudes can be much higher than their counterparts. In a high-power rocket, an altimeter or electronic timer may deploy a drogue parachute (which stabilizes the rocket in descent) or a controlled freefall (where the fore and aft sections are merely separated by a tether or umbilical cord, often made of tubular nylon). These recovery events can be brought about by small explosive charges (black powder or Pyrodex) or pressurized gasses (e.g., CO2). At an altitude predetermined by the hobbyist, an altimeter deploys a main parachute that slows the rocket to a safe recovery speed. The most common varieties of altimeter use accelerometers, barometric sensors or a combination of both.

Modern studies of family traditions  The study of Family tradition and personality has attracted attention of social scientists. Ernest W. Burgess, Professor of Sociology, University of Chicago, has defined the term in these words: Sometimes, family traditions are associated with practices and beliefs which are handed over from one generation to the next generation, and during this process of transmission such family traditions also acquire an aura of spirituality. Transmission of any set of such family traditions, acquiring spiritual significance, is largely an intuitive phenomenon, and the flow of family traditions continue without any intention, and the same continue to move on from one generation to the next generation. Family traditions for most of the families remain largely confined within the family members, but some times, non-family members may also get associated with particular family's family traditions.  Functioning of family traditions  Halbwachs in his book On Collective Meare revealed only to its members. But these memories, as in the religious traditions of the family of antiquity, consist not only of a series of individual images of the past. They are at the same time models, examples, and elements of teaching. They express the general attitude of the group; they not only reproduce its history but also define its nature and its qualities and weaknesses‚Äù.http://www.losingtom.org/memory/culturalMemory.html  Antiquity of family traditions  Family traditions have their roots in distant past, to pre-historic times, when the concept and system of family as a unit of society was crystallized. In all ages and in all civilizations, since the ancient time to the present day, families have taken pride in their traditions. Before nuclear family systems became the order of the day, there used to be joint family system, consisting of all the family members of two or even three generations, living together. Then, as also now, several families like to identify a particular person as the 'keeper of the family traditions and assign a particular name to the keeper. Thus, a particular family, residing in the modern United Kingdom may assign a catchy name like ‚ÄúKeeper of the Flame‚Äù to the identified family member, entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring observance of that particular family‚Äôs family traditions. On the other side of the globe, in a country like India, the society has assigned a common nomenclature for the head of a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), a form of joint family. Head of such a family is called ‚ÄúKarta‚Äù (literal meaning ‚ÄòOne who does‚Äô), and for all practical purposes, ‚ÄúKarta‚Äù was entrusted with responsibilities, among other things, to ensure observance of family traditions. Even, modern India's legal system recognizes the concept of ‚ÄúKarta‚Äù as the head of a Hindu joint family.  Classic examples of family traditions  One of the classic examples of family traditions of the modern era is the family traditions of the present royal family of Great Britain. One of such family traditions enjoin upon male members of the present British royal family to serve in the armed forces. A BBC report has announced on 12 June 2003 that ‚ÄúPrince Harry‚Äôs decision to join the Army means he will follow a long family tradition of serving the military.‚Äùhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2984826.stm Before him, his uncle, Prince Andrew, had joined the Navy in 1979. Prince Harry‚Äôs other uncle, Prince Edward had joined the Royal Marines as a second lieutenant in 1983. Prince Harry‚Äôs father, the Prince of Wales, was appointed in 1969 as colonel-in-chief of the Royal Regiment of Wales. Harry‚Äôs grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, had joined the Navy in 1939, and had also served in the World War II.  Family traditions in the modern context  Meaningful family traditions have always been a valuable tool for parents and elders to carry out the responsibility of raising children and inculcating into them social values and ethos. Family traditions ensure that the warmth and closeness of family bondage grow. In the modern context, maintenance of and developing family traditions continue to be as significant as they were at the earliest times. Active family traditions and meaningful participation in them help families to avoid social entropy. In physical science, the term entropy means the tendency of the physical system to lose energy and coherence over a period of time, like a gas dissipating until it is all but gone. An \\"entropic family\\" is one that loses its sense of emotional closeness because members neglect the family‚Äôs inner life and community ties. Social scientists now agree that effective family traditions promote a sense of identity and a feeling of closeness, a sense of security and assurance in today‚Äôs fast, hectic, and ever-changing world. William Doherty, a social scientist has explained in his book \\"The Intentional Family\\" that as family bonds are weakened by busy lifestyles, families can stay connected only by being intentional about maintaining important rituals and traditions.

Overview Al-Turk joined the Syrian Communist Party while a student. He was imprisoned for the first time in 1952 shortly after finishing law school for opposing the military government that came to power in a coup. He was held for five months and tortured but never tried in court. He later wrote articles for the party newspaper, Al-Nour, and became a leading party ideologue. He was imprisoned again in 1958 under Nasser for opposing the merger of Syria and Egypt in the United Arab Republic and held for sixteen months. Again he was tortured but not tried for any crime. Turk had for some time been leading a faction within the Communist Party that demanded a more positive view of Arab nationalism, in opposition to Secretary- General Khalid Bakdash, who ruled the party with an iron fist. In 1972, Bakdash decided to merge the party into the National Progressive Front, a coalition of organizations allied with the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party. Along with supporters on the radical wing of the party, Turk formed the Syrian Communist Party (Political Bureau), consolidating a split that had been apparent since the late 1960s. The SCP-Political Bureau initially negotiated with the government for terms of legalization and membership in the Front. However, it later took a strong opposition stance, especially from 1976 on after the Syrian intervention in favour of the Maronites right-wing government in the Lebanese Civil War. This led to repression of the party, which was stepped up at the beginning of the 1980s when the Hafez al-Assad government felt itself under increasing pressure from both Islamists and the secular opposition. Al-Turk was arrested and imprisoned on 28 October 1980 and held under very difficult conditions for almost 18 years.Wright, Dreams and Shadows, 2008, p.214-5 He spent most of this period in solitary confinement and suffering regular torture. Based on interviews with al-Turk journalist Robin Wright reports he was \\"locked way in a windowless underground cell, about the length of his body or the size of a small elevator compartment, at an intelligence headquarters.\\" Al-Turk was \\"never allowed out of his cell to exercise. Until the final months, he was not allowed a book, newspaper, mail or anything else to keep his mind occupied.\\" For the first thirteen years of his imprisonment he was allowed no communication from, or information about, his friends and family, including his two young daughters. His \\"only activity was being allowed three times a day to go to a shared toilet.\\" He was never allowed to use it when other prisoners were there but did scrounge the toilet bin for discarded clothing as his own clothing was worn out. One of his few diversions was collecting grains of dark cereal he found in the thin soup he was served in the evening and using the grains to create pictures in his cell.Wright, Dreams and Shadows, 2008, p.216 He suffered considerable ill- health, including diabetes for which he was refused treatment. He was released on 30 May 1998. After his release in 1998, al-Turk was initially not particularly active politically. In June 2000, however, Syrian president Hafiz al-Asad died and his son Bashar succeeded him. This was followed by an outburst of political debate and demands for democratic changes, known as the Damascus Spring, and al-Turk resumed a prominent role. His statement on al Jazeera television in August 2001 that \\"the dictator has died\\" was seen as a direct cause of renewed repression by an angered government, and al-Turk himself was arrested some days later on September 1, 2001, subjected to a trial widely seen as unfair before a state security court. In June 2002 he was sentenced to three years imprisonment for \`attempting to change the constitution by illegal means.\`Wright, Dreams and Shadows, 2008, p.218 This led to international protests, especially given his poor health. Al-Turk was released after serving fifteen months of his sentence, and resumed his political activities. In spring 2005 the Syrian Communist Party (Political Bureau) held a secret congress at which it decided to change its name to the Syrian Democratic People's Party. At this congress, Turk stepped down as party secretary, but he remains an influential member of the organization. In the same year, he also emerged as a prominent name in the Damascus Declaration, a pro-democracy coalition of Syrian opposition activists and organizations.

In 1862, when he was the Interior Minister of Argentina, he met Captain Love Jones-Parry and Lewis Jones, who were on their way to Patagonia to investigate whether it was suitable for the creation of a Welsh settlement there. Rawson came to an agreement with them, and this resulted in the creation of a colony in the Chubut Valley in the following years. The city of Rawson, the capital of the province of Chubut, was named after him. Biography Memorial to Guillermo Rawson in Buenos Aires. Guillermo Rawson's parents were Dr. Am√°n Rawson, a doctor who had emigrated from the United States to Argentina, and Justina Rojo, a daughter of a wealthy family in San Juan, where Guillermo was born. His elder brother was the artist Franklin Rawson. His half-brother was Liuetenant Colonel Juan de Dios Rawson, grandfather of Arturo Rawson. After a Jesuit education in San Juan, Rawson graduated from the Medical Faculty of University of Buenos Aires in 1844. Rawson became interested in politics and democracy. In 1853, he was jailed for opposing Nazario Benavidez, the caudillo or de facto governor of San Juan. The following year he was a member of the Paran√° Congress, and from 1862, he was Interior Minister in the government of Bartolom√© Mitre. Apart from politics, Rawson was interested in medicine and hygiene. In 1876, he attended the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia to present his work on public health in Buenos Aires, the most developed body of work on the subject at the time. In 1879, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Rawson spent a year in Paris in 1881 for medical treatment, before returning to Argentina. He returned to France for further treatment in 1885 and died in Paris in 1890. The building of the first Medical School in Buenos Aires is named after him (Escuela Dr Guillermo Rawson).

As a closer with the San Diego Padres from 2009 to 2011, Bell was a three-time All-Star and twice won the Rolaids Relief Man Award. He was also awarded the DHL Delivery Man of the Year Award and The Sporting News Reliever of the Year Award. Bell played multiple sports, including baseball, in high school. He moved on to community college, where he was an All-American. He began his professional career with the New York Mets, making his major league debut in 2004, and spending three seasons at both the minor and major league levels. In 2007, he was traded to San Diego, where he was a setup man before replacing Trevor Hoffman as the Padres' closer. From 2010 through 2011, Bell successfully converted 41 straight save opportunities, which tied Hoffman's team record. A free agent after the 2011 season, he signed with the Miami Marlins, and later played with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Rays. He retired before the 2015 season. Early years Bell was born in Oceanside, California. He attended Columbus Tustin Middle School and Tustin High School in Tustin, California, which is about from Oceanside. He lettered in football, basketball, and baseball. Bell attended Santa Ana College where he was named a freshman All-American in 1997. In 1997 Bell made two appearances in the National Baseball Congress world series while playing for the El Dorado Broncos. He did not give up any runs and was named the league's Graduate of the Year in 2011. He was selected by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 69th round of the 1997 amateur draft, but did not sign. Professional career =New York Mets= Bell did not begin his professional career until 1998, when he signed with the New York Mets as an undrafted free agent. He made his major league debut on August 24, 2004 pitching two scoreless innings with three strikeouts against the San Diego Padres. The righty spent the next two seasons shuttling between the Mets and their Triple-A affiliate Norfolk. Bell said coaches in the Mets' minor leagues told him his best opportunity to succeed was to leave the organization as other people did not believe in him. =San Diego Padres= Bell congratulated after a save in 2009. On November 15, 2006, Bell was traded to San Diego, along with pitcher Royce Ring, for outfielder Ben Johnson and relief pitcher Jon Adkins. He was part of the Padres bullpen, where he replaced Scott Linebrink as the 8th inning setup man before Trevor Hoffman closed games. In 2009, Hoffman signed with the Milwaukee Brewers and Bell was promoted to closer. Bell sprints from the bullpen and into a save situation accompanied by the song \\"Blow Me Away\\" by Breaking Benjamin. Bell's save situations are referred to by fans as \\"Bell's Hell\\", a play on Hoffman's famous \\"Hells Bells\\". In 2009, Bell was named MLB Delivery Man of the Month in April after converting all eight of his save opportunities in scoreless innings of work while striking out nine batters. He was named to the National League (NL) All- Star Team on July 5. He, along with teammate Adri√°n Gonz√°lez, represented the Padres at the 2009 MLB All-Star Game in St. Louis on July 14. Bell came on in the 8th inning and gave up a triple to Curtis Granderson followed by a sacrifice fly to Adam Jones to make the score 4‚Äì3 in the American League's favor; Bell was the losing pitcher in the game. Bell ended the 2009 season leading the National League in saves with 42 in his first year as a full-time closer. He won the NL Rolaids Relief Man Award In 2010, Bell was named to his second consecutive NL All-Star team in July. Starting May 29, he converted 34 consecutive saves to end the season, the longest streak by a Padres since Hoffman. Bell collected saves on a season-high four consecutive days from August 10‚Äì13. For the year, Bell had a career-high 47 saves, which ranked second in MLB and was second in team history behind Hoffman's 53 in 1998. Bell's .940 save percentage (47 of 50) led all of MLB. He did not allow any of his nine inherited runners to score, and he had six saves of more than one inning pitched. Bell won the DHL Delivery Man of the Year Award, The Sporting News NL Reliever of the Year Award, and the NL Rolaids Relief Man Award. Bell catching ceremonial first pitch in 2011 Bell was the highest paid Padres player in 2011 at $7.5 million salary and would be eligible for free agency at the end of the season. He converted his first seven save opportunities of 2011, which tied him with Hoffman for the Padres club record of 41 consecutive successful save conversions. The streak also tied him with Hoffman and Rod Beck for the then-fourth longest in MLB history. Bell blew his next save opportunity, a 3‚Äì0 lead, after he opened the ninth inning walking the first two batters, and third baseman Chase Headley made a two-out, two-run throwing error to tie the game. On May 14, Bell recorded his 100th career save in a 9‚Äì7 win over the Colorado Rockies. Bell was selected to his third consecutive All- Star game. Entering the game in the eight inning, Bell sprinted from the bullpen and did a slide in front of the pitcher's mound, taking out a chunk of the infield grass and leaving grass stains on his pants. \\"I wanted the fans to have fun with this\\", said Bell. With the team 12 games under .500 coming out of the All-Star break, general manager Jed Hoyer said the Padres would pursue a long-term contract with Bell if they did not get a desirable trade offer for him. Ultimately Bell was not traded at the non-waiver trade deadline on July 31, but Hoyer admitted Bell's greatest value to the team might come as a free agent if Bell refuses salary arbitration and signs elsewhere‚Äîthe Padres would receive two first-round draft picks in June 2012 as compensation. Bell said he planned to accept arbitration from the Padres if they did not agree on a multi-year deal. He finished the season 43 of 48 in save opportunities with a 2.44 ERA, but he struck out less than 30 percent of all opponents‚Äô at-bats for the first time as a Padre. Bell wanted a three-year contract from the Padres, who instead offered two years with an option for 2014. Talks stalled after Hoyer left the Padres and was replaced by Josh Byrnes as general manager. The Padres offered arbitration, but Bell backed away from his earlier intention to accept arbitration. The Miami Marlins, the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim were also interested in signing him. Bell had a 27‚Äì19 record with a 2.53 earned run average and 134 saves in 354 appearances with the Padres over five seasons. His 132 saves in the last three seasons led the majors. =Miami Marlins= Miami Marlins in 2012 On December 5, 2011, Bell signed a three-year, $27 million contract with the Miami Marlins. He was temporarily demoted from the closer role in May after beginning the 2012 season blowing four of his first seven save opportunities with an 0‚Äì3 record and an 11.42 ERA in 11 games. Bell said he had been battling an undisclosed personal issue, and he felt \\"completely lost\\" in Miami being apart from his family. On May 11, 2012, Marlins manager Ozzie Guill√©n placed Bell back to the closer role, and his ERA dropped below 10.00 later that month. He was again demoted after the All-Star break, when he was 2-5 with a 6.75 ERA and six blown saves in 25 opportunities, and Steve Cishek assumed the closer role. Late in the season, a rift between Bell and Guillen developed with each proclaiming waning respect for one another. Bell acknowledged his teammates likely lost respect for him after the incident. Bell had an 0.69 ERA over his last 13 appearances before blowing a 3‚Äì0 lead in the eighth inning in his last game of the year. He ended the season 4‚Äì5 with a 5.09 ERA and 19-for-27 in save chances. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On October 20, 2012, the Marlins traded Bell to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a three-team trade in which the Marlins acquired minor leaguer Yordy Cabrera. Arizona already had incumbent closer J. J. Putz. The Marlins agreed to pay $8 million of the remaining $21 million still owed Bell over the subsequent two years. He began the season as a middle reliever behind Putz and setup man David Hernandez. On May 8, Bell was promoted to closer after Putz was placed on the disabled list with a strained right elbow. =Tampa Bay Rays= On December 3, 2013, Bell was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays in a three-team deal also involving the Cincinnati Reds. He was designated for assignment on May 4, 2014, before being released on May 11. Bell had a 7.27 ERA in 13 appearances with the Rays. =Baltimore Orioles/New York Yankees= On May 16, 2014, Bell agreed to a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles. He appeared in just 10 games for the Triple-A Norfolk Tides before he opted out of his deal on June 8. A few days later, on June 13, he signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees. On June 24, the Yankees released Bell just 11 days after signing him. He had a 7.50 ERA in six innings (over five games) for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. =Retirement= On December 22, 2014, Bell signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals that included an invitation to major league spring training, however he was released on March 23. He announced his retirement from baseball the following day. Scouting report Bell Pitching Generally a power pitcher, Bell averaged nearly a full strikeout per inning but also proved to be hittable in his 2005 sophomore season allowing 10.8 hits per nine innings and a very high 5.59 earned run average. Bell has a 94‚Äì98 mph fastball, usually sitting between 95 and 96. He also has an 11‚Äì5 curveball in the low 80s.

The earliest species occurred in the second half of the Lower Cambrian, and the last species did not survive the Ordovician‚ÄìSilurian extinction event. Asaphiscus wheeleri, a Cambrian trilobite of the Superfamily Ptychoparioidea Trilobites have facial sutures that run along the margin of the glabella and/or fixigena to the shoulder point where the cephalon meets the thorax. These sutures outline the cranidium, or the main, central part of the head that does not include the librigena (free cheeks). The eyes are medial along the glabella on the suture line (and some species have no eyes). The fossils of the moults of trilobites can often be told from the fossils of the actual animals by whether the librigena are present. (The librigena, or cheek spines, detach during moulting.) In ptychopariids, short bladelike genal spines are often present on the tips of the librigena. The thorax is large and is typically made up of eight or more segments. The thorax is usually much longer than the pygidium, which is usually small. In some species the pygidium is outlined with a flat border. The Subclass Librostoma was recently erected to encompass several related orders, including Ptychopariida, Asaphida, Proetida, Harpetida, and possibly Phacopida.

LaCugna's passion was to make the doctrine of the Trinity relevant to the everyday life of modern Christians. LaCugna earned her bachelor's degree at Seattle University, her Masters and Doctorate at Fordham University, and joined the faculty at University of Notre Dame in 1981. There, she taught systematic theology to graduate and undergraduate students, eventually holding the Nancy Reeves Dreux Chair of Theology at the University of Notre Dame. Catherine LaCugna died at the age of 44, of cancer, and is buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery on the Notre Dame campus.  Trinitarian theology  LaCugna, a Western Theologian, sought common ground with Eastern Christians through re-examining early Christian scholars or Church Fathers. She rejected modern individualist notions of personhood and emphasised the self-communication of God. Building on the work of Karl Rahner, LaCugna argued that the \\"demise of the doctrine of the Trinity\\" started when early church theologians had to respond to the teachings of Arius, arch-heretic of the Christian church. Arius' doctrine required a response, and the Church Fathers' response began the theological trek into speculation on the inner, hidden life of God, commonly referred to as the immanent Trinity. Whereas before, theologians had concentrated on the nature of God as revealed in God's actions in history (commonly called the economic Trinity). According to LaCugna, the church father Augustine furthered this divide between economic and immanent Trinity with his psychological model of the Trinity, which described the inner life of God as being like a human's memory, intellect, and will. The real culprit in this matter, though, was Thomas Aquinas, whose scholastic theology took theological speculation to a whole new level. Against Rahner and Karl Barth (in Church Dogmatics I/1, ¬ß9), LaCugna wished to retain the use of the word persons in relation to the three persons of the Trinity. Rahner's manners of subsisting and Barth's modes (or ways) of being she saw as too easily adopting the modern notion of individualistic personhood, instead of a relational and interdependent model. LaCugna says that God is known ontologically only through God's self- revelation in the economy of salvation, and that \\"Theories about what God is apart from God's self-communication in salvation history remain unverifiable and ultimately untheological.\\"God for Us p231 She says faithful Trinitarian theology must be practical and include an understanding of our own personhood in relationship with God and each other, which she calls \\"Living God's life with one another\\".God for Us p411 LaCugna's doctrine of the Trinity has been challenged by theologians such as Nicholas Lash and James William McClendon, Jr.  Awards  Professor LaCugna received two significant teaching awards from Notre Dame University. In 1993 she received the Frank O'Malley undergraduate teaching award, and she received the Charles E. Sheedy Teaching Award in 1996.

Biography Born in Fossombrone near Urbino, Marche, he went to Rome in 1695, where he studied philosophy at the Collegio Clementino (Ph.D. in 1701) and law at the university La Sapienza. Already in these early years he corresponded with scholars throughout Europe, including Protestants and Jansenists. In 1706, he was sent as legate to Paris, where he stayed for two years. Later he traveled through the Netherlands, where he participated as official representative of the Holy See at the peace conferences of The Hague (1708) and Utrecht (1712). Upon his return to Rome, he was made a prelate. However, when he was denied a nunciature, he temporarily retired from 1717 (after his father's death) to 1721 on his estate in Fossombrone. Under the new Pope Innocent XIII, he finally was named Nuncio in Lucerne, Switzerland, and also made titulary archbishop of Ephesos. From 1730 to 1738, he was Nuncio in Vienna. In 1738, he was created Cardinal Priest, and three years later, he became pro-librarian of the Vatican Library to Cardinal Angelo Maria Quirini, whom he would succeed as librarian in 1755. He was also a corresponding member of Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis. Passionei was decidedly anti-Jesuit, opposing the beatification of the Jesuit Cardinal Bellarmine in 1754. Other than that, he was a proponent of a liberal Catholicism and considered a protector of Jansenists, and defended authors like Montesquieu or Helv√©tius in Index trials. He was also a manuscript collector, minuscule 847 and minuscule 848 were his manuscripts.

In the agreement, the two parties reaffirmed the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, which had been signed on 18 June 2000.Uppsala Conflict Data Program Conflict Encyclopedia, Ethiopia, Peace Agreement, Agreement between the Government of the State of Eritrea and the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=55&regionSelect;=1-Northern_Africa# The agreement provided for the exchange of prisoners and the return of displaced persons and established a Boundary Commission to demarcate the border and a Claims Commission to assess damages caused by the conflict. The purpose of the agreement was to: * end/terminate hostilities permanently and agree to refrain from the threat or use of force. * respect and implement fully the provisions of an agreement on cessation of hostilities signed on June 18, 2000. * release and repatriate all prisoners of war and all other persons detained. * provide humane treatment to each other's nationals and persons of each other's national origin within their respective territories. The agreement established two neutral commissions: the Boundary Commission, and the Claims Commission. Each commission was composed of five members and located in The Hague, Netherlands. Each country was to appoint two commissioners who were not nationals of the country. The president of each commission was selected by the other commissioners. Provision was made that if they failed to agree on a president within 30 days, the Secretary-General of the United Nations would appoint a president after consultation with the parties. Boundary Commission The two governments agreed to determine the origins of the conflict by allowing an investigation incidents of 1997 and 1998 and earlier regarding their common border. The investigation would be carried out by an independent, impartial body, known as the Ethiopian-Eritrean Boundary Commission (EEBC), appointed by the Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), in consultation with the Secretary General of the United Nations and the two parties. The two governments reaffirmed the principle of respect for the borders existing at independence, and that the border was to be determined on the basis of colonial treaties and applicable international law by the EEBC. The United Nations Cartographer would serve as Secretary to the EEBC, and undertake such tasks as assigned to him by the Commission, making use of the technical expertise of the UN Cartographic Unit. Each party provided its claims and evidence to the Secretary, who provided to the EEBC his findings based on this evidence, identifying those portions of the border where there appeared to be no dispute between the parties. Where there was disagreement, the parties presented written and oral submissions and any additional evidence directly to the EEBC. Upon reaching a final decision regarding delimitation of the borders, the EEBC transmitted its decision to the parties and Secretaries General of the OAU and the UN, and the EEBC would arrange for demarcation. The parties agreed that the delimitation and demarcation determinations of the EEBC would be final and binding. Each party agreed to respect the border so determined, as well as the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the other party. The EEBC issued a final border ruling in 2003, but its decision was rejected by Ethiopia. As of August 2004, the border question remained in dispute, although a tentative peace continued. By November 2007 the EEBC concluded the demarcation phase of the Algiers Agreement. As of that date, Ethiopia had not withdrawn its troops from those positions on the Eritrean side of the demarcated border. However, as of September 2007, Ethiopia considered Eritrea to be in breach of the agreement, and warned that it could use this as grounds to terminate or suspend the agreement. In December 2007, an estimated 4000 Eritrean troops remained in the 'demilitarized zone' with a further 120,000 along its side of the border. Ethiopia maintained 100,000 troops along its side.\\"Ethiopia and Eritrea: Bad words over Badme\\", The Economist, 13 December 2007 One of the six points of the 2018 Eritrea‚ÄìEthiopia summit was to respect the findings of the Boundary Commission. Claims Commission A neutral Claims Commission was also established. The mandate of the Commission was to decide through binding arbitration all claims for loss, damage or injury by one Government against the other, and by nationals of one party against the Government of the other party or entities owned or controlled by the other party that were (a) related to the conflict, and (b) resulted from violations of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, or other violations of international law. The Commission would not hear claims arising from the cost of military operations, preparing for military operations, or the use of force, except to the extent that such claims involve violations of international humanitarian law. Claims were submitted to the Commission by each of the parties on its own behalf and on behalf of its nationals within one year from the effective date of the agreement, and with certain exceptions, the Commission was to be the only forum for such claims. In appropriate cases, the parties could file claims on behalf of persons of Eritreans or Ethiopian origin who were not nationals. The Commission was authorized to develop its own methods of efficient case management and mass claims processing. The Commission was to endeavor to complete its work within three years of the date when the period for filing claims closes. The Commission was to apply relevant rules of international law. Decisions and awards of the Commission were final and binding. The parties agreed to honour all decisions and to pay any monetary awards rendered against them promptly. The agreement strongly recommended that the Eritrea deserves the 1,000 kilometer space between the two countries' borders. Finally, the agreement came to completion by advising the countries leader by fulfilling their utmost effort to bring sustainable peace and development within the border.

It is typically tightly integrated with register allocation, where it is used as an alternative to spilling registers to memory. It was conceived by Gregory Chaitin, Marc Auslander, Ashok Chandra, John Cocke, Martin Hopkins and Peter Markstein and implemented in the Pl.8 compiler for the 801 Minicomputer in the late 1970s. Later improvements were made by Preston Briggs, Keith D. Cooper, and Linda Torczon in 1992. Traditional optimizations such as common subexpression elimination and loop invariant hoisting often focus on eliminating redundant computation. Since computation requires CPU cycles, this is usually a good thing, but it has the potentially devastating side effect that it can increase the live ranges of variables and create many new variables, resulting in spills during register allocation. Rematerialization is nearly the opposite: it decreases register pressure by increasing the amount of CPU computation. To avoid adding more computation time than necessary, rematerialization is done only when the compiler can be confident that it will be of benefit -- that is, when a register spill to memory would otherwise occur. Rematerialization works by keeping track of the expression used to compute each variable, using the concept of available expressions. Sometimes the variables used to compute a value are modified, and so can no longer be used to rematerialize that value. The expression is then said to no longer be available. Other criteria must also be fulfilled, for example a maximum complexity on the expression used to rematerialize the value; it would do no good to rematerialize a value using a complex computation that takes more time than a load. Usually the expression must also have no side effects.

After this feat, she continued to forge new fronts in the hiking world and became the first person to hike the Appalachian National Trail (also known as the A.T.) three times, with her last venture completed in 1963 at age 75.\\"When Grandma Gatewood hiked the Appalachian Trail\\". Sierra Club. .  Biography  Emma Gatewood Gatewood was born to a family of 15 children in Guyan Township, Gallia County, Ohio. Her father, a farmer, turned to a life of drinking and gambling after his leg was amputated in the Civil War. The child-rearing of the family was left to her mother Evelyn (Trowbridge) Caldwell. Emma and her siblings slept four to a bed in their log cabin. At the age of 19 she married 27-year-old P. C. Gatewood, a college educated primary school teacher, and later tobacco farmer, with whom she had 11 children. Almost immediately he sent her to work burning tobacco beds, building fences, and mixing cement in addition to her expected housework duties. Within months of the marriage, he started to beat her, a vicious pattern that continued for the entirety of their marriage. She recalled being beaten nearly to death on several occasions. She survived broken ribs, broken teeth, and other injuries during the abusive marriage. When her husband became violent, she would, on occasion, run from the house into the woods where she found peace and solitude. She eventually successfully divorced P. C. Gatewood in 1940. This was at a time when divorce was difficult, and after her husband had repeatedly threatened to have her committed to an insane asylum as a means of maintaining control over her. She had 24 grandchildren, 30 great-grandchildren, and one great-great- grandchild living at the time of her death, from a heart attack,'Emma Gatewood, Buckeye Trail Director, Dies' Lancaster (Ohio) Eagle-Gazette, 6 June 1973 p. 2 at 85.  Hiking  In 1955, at the age of 67, Gatewood told her grown children that she was going for a walk. They did not ask where or for how long, as they knew she was resilient and would take care of herself. About 5 years earlier, Gatewood read an article in National Geographic about the A.T. and thought \\"it would be a nice lark,\\" though in retrospect considering the difficulty she added \\"It wasn't.\\" The magazine gave her the impression of easy walks and clean cabins at the end of each day's expedition. Thus she took little in the way of outdoor gear. She wore Keds shoes and carried an army blanket, a raincoat, and a plastic shower curtain in a homemade denim bag slung over one shoulder. She would later say \\"For some fool reason, they always lead you right up over the biggest rock to the top of the biggest mountain they can find.\\" Local newspapers picked up on her story in the southern states, then the Associated Press did a national profile of her while in Maryland, leading to an article in Sports Illustrated when she had reached Connecticut. After the hike she was invited on the Today Show. These appearances made her a celebrity even before the hike was over and she was often recognized and received \\"trail magic\\" (assistance from strangers) in the form of friends, food and places to sleep. She hiked the AT again in 1960, and then again at age 75 in 1963, making her the first person to hike the trail three times (though her final hike was completed in sections). She was also credited with being the oldest female thru-hiker by the Appalachian Trail Conference. In addition, she walked of the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri, to Portland, Oregon, averaging a day. She traveled to every state of the continental United States. In 1970, at age 83, while visiting Appalachian Outfitters in Oakton, Virginia she was asked what she thought about the latest lightweight backpacking gear. Emma advised: \\"Make a rain cape, and an over the shoulder sling bag, and buy a sturdy pair of Keds tennis shoes. Stop at local groceries and pick up Vienna sausages... most everything else to eat you can find beside the trail... and by the way those wild onions are not called \\"Ramps\\"... they are \\"Rampions\\" ... a ramp is an inclined plane.\\" Gatewood was a life member of the National Campers and Hikers Association and the Roanoke Appalachian Trail Club. She was Director Emeritus and a lifetime member of the Buckeye Trail Association.  Legacy  Her legacy lives on through various tributes, artistic works, and other commemorative projects. In fact, the A.T. recognized her by including her odyssey in exhibits in The Appalachian Trail Museum. Additionally, in June 2012, she was inducted into the Appalachian Trail Hall of Fame. Other trails in the industry recognized her feats including Hocking Hills State Park in Ohio, where the North Country Trail, Buckeye Trail, and the American Discovery Trail coincide and a six-mile section is designated as the Grandma Gatewood Trail. It connects Old Man's Cave to Cedar Falls to Ash Cave. She has been the subject of projects, songs, and films, including a story-telling program and one act play designed by Eden Valley Enterprises. Additionally,Trail Magic, a 60-minute documentary by Put- in-Bay filmmaker Peter Huston, is about Emma Gatewood. Jeff & Paige, a children's music duo based in Boulder, Colorado, released a song in her honor, titled \\"Grandma Gatewood\\", on their 2015 album \\"Mighty Wolf\\".In 2018, her story was revived by her feature in the New York Times Overlooked series, which adds stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in the historically male-dominated obituaries of the Times. The piece, a belated obituary, details her hiking accomplishments and abusive family life. Biographies Trail Magic: The Grandma Gatewood Story (PBS documentary).

Originally hosted by Chuck Woolery, the show debuted in syndication on September 19, 1983, and ended on July 1, 1994, after 2,120 shows. Reruns continued to air until September 8, 1995.The Intelligencer ‚Äì September 8, 1995 The series was relaunched for one season in 1998 under the same title with Pat Bullard as host. In 2017, the series returned on Fox with Andy Cohen hosting. This second revival ran for two seasons. Love Connection was produced by Eric Lieber Productions in association with and distributed by Telepictures (1983‚Äì1986), Lorimar- Telepictures (1986‚Äì1989), Lorimar Television (1989‚Äì1990), and Warner Bros. Television (1989‚Äì1994). Format Love Connections main premise was to arrange dates for couples. A guest appeared on the show after going on a date with one of three contestants, having chosen on the basis of the contestants' videotaped profiles. After the date, the televised appearance was scheduled. Love Connection tapings took place before a live studio audience. Woolery introduced the guest and show excerpts from the three candidates' videos. The studio audience then secretly voted on which candidate they preferred for the guest. (In the 1998‚Äì99 version, home viewers voted online and were included in the tally.) The guest then revealed whom he or she had actually dated, and the date joined the conversation from backstage via closed-circuit television camera. Woolery led the guest and date to discuss their time together. If they both agreed that the date had been successful, the couple would be reunited onstage; otherwise, the date's participation in the show ended. Woolery then revealed the vote result; if the guest had had a successful date with the vote winner, Woolery congratulated the couple for making a \\"love connection,\\" and they would usually (but not always) accept the offered prize of a second date at the show's expense. After a successful date, the guest was always offered another date with that person. However, if the vote winner was one of the other contestants, the guest could choose a date with the vote winner, regardless of the success of the first date. In addition, if the guest had already unsuccessfully dated the audience pick, the guest could choose to go on a date with either of the other contestants. If a second date took place, the couple would be invited back for a second interview at a later taping. Two or three segments usually aired per show. In a variation that aired on Fridays, a bachelor or bachelorette who had not yet chosen a date made an appearance and allow the studio audience to make the choice for him or her, based on video excerpts. The couple would report back in the usual fashion several weeks later. If the couple hit it off, they were entitled to a second date at the show's expense. If not, the contestant could choose between the two losing candidates for the second date. In the 2017 revival, the guest appeared on the show after having gone on a date with each of the three contestants, and all three were interviewed from backstage after the video intros and audience vote. This version added a segment where guests and contestants rate their first impressions of each other's looks on a scale of 1‚Äì10; however, some contestants have acknowledged basing this rating in part on factors other than physical looks, such as punctuality or fashion sense. After the interviews, the guest received an overnight date with the contestant of his or her choice, along with a chance to receive a $10,000 cash prize. In season 1, the guest automatically received the prize if the audience vote matched his or her choice; otherwise, the guest was given the option to instead spend the overnight date with the vote winner and thereby receive the monetary prize. In season 2, the option to switch was dropped; the guest spent the overnight date with the contestant he or she chose, and the $10,000 prize was awarded if the audience vote matched that choice. The great majority of contestants in the original series were in their twenties and had never been married. However, older never-married, widowed, and divorced (some multiple times) contestants were occasionally selected as well. The relationship status of the contestants was noted on-screen in their profile summary in both syndicated iterations of the show, but is not referenced in the 2017 revival unless it arises in conversation between the guest, dates, and host. In the original series, men were paired only with women, and vice versa; the 2017 revival has included same-sex pairings. The show paid the expenses incurred on the date, plus $75 for incidentals.mentioned on a 1985 episode re-aired on GSN The incidental amount was increased to $100 for the 1998‚Äì1999 revival. In the 2017 revival, contestants were given $500 for each date. Legacy The show was one of the biggest game show hits of the 1980s and early 1990s, and helped revive Chuck Woolery's hosting career. At 11 seasons and 2,120 episodes, it was one of the longest lasting game shows in syndication. For many years it was third behind Merv Griffin's Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune (formerly hosted by Woolery) for longest lasting game show in syndication, but since has been surpassed by Family Feud and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Coincidentally, the show premiered on the same date (September 19) that Woolery's former show, Wheel of Fortune, debuted its syndicated edition in 1983. As of 1993, among the couples who met on the show, there were a total of 29 marriages, 8 engagements, and 15 children, according to Woolery. A year later, in a Daily Variety trade ad promoting the end of the original show's run after 11 seasons, it was stated that there were 35,478 taped interviews, 2,120 episodes, 31 marriages, and 20 children.Daily Variety Magazine; June 21, 1994; Page 25 =\\"Two and two\\"= Woolery created his trademark phrase \\"We'll be back in two and two\\" on Love Connection (and simultaneously on Scrabble, the daytime game show he hosted on NBC during the same period). The line referred to the fact that the program would return in two minutes and two seconds, the total length of a standard commercial break at the time, including the fade-out and fade-ins bookending each break. =Syndication= The Chuck Woolery episodes were rerun on the USA Network from October 16, 1995The Intelligencer ‚Äì October 16, 1995 to June 6, 1997The Post Standard ‚Äì June 6, 1997 and on the Game Show Network from January 6, 2003HighBeam to July 18, 2008.GSN Schedule PDFs ‚Äì July 14‚Äì20, 2008 Beginning November 9, 2009, the Woolery episodes returned to GSN's weekday lineup but have since been removed.GSN Schedule PDFs ‚Äì November 16‚Äì22, 2009 The Pat Bullard version has not been aired since its cancellation.

Biography Born in Guayaquil, Palacio is a physician by profession, specializing in cardiology. He studied in his home town and, later, at Cleveland, Ohio, doing residency at Case Western Reserve University, followed by a two-year cardiology fellowship at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States. He later lectured in cardiology and public health at the University of Guayaquil's faculty of medicine. Palacio was chosen as Lucio Guti√©rrez's running mate in the 2002 election. It was a common sight during the campaign to see Guti√©rrez, dressed in his army fatigues, accompanied by Palacio, wearing surgical scrubs. Palacio had previously served as the minister for health during the administration of Sixto Dur√°n Ball√©n. Many of the ministers he chose were from the Democratic Left (Ecuador). One of Palacio's first proposals made as president was to hold a Constitutional Assembly to amend Ecuador's 1998 Constitution. For a period of several months prior to assuming office, he had been a critic of the Guti√©rrez regime, saying that the country was \\"falling apart\\" and in need of \\"intensive care\\". Rafael Correa was elected president in November 2006 and replaced Palacio as president on January 15, 2007. World Health Organization Palacio was one of the candidates for the position of director- general of the World Health Organization, to be decided in a vote on November 9, 2006. However, on October 18, 2006, he announced he would not be pursuing the position, preferring to concentrate on his presidency until the very last day of his mandate.

The school is regularly amongst the top-performing schools in England, and in 2010 was the school with the best results in the English Baccalaureate. It was granted academy status in March 2011 and is an Additional Member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. It is within the grounds of Salisbury Cathedral, adjacent to the Cathedral School. Sixth form teaching is in collaboration with South Wilts Grammar School for Girls; from September 2020, the school will admit girls to its sixth form. The school's full name is Bishop Wordsworth's Church of England Grammar School for Boys, shortened to BWS. It is known colloquially as Bishop's, and its students as Bishop's Boys. The school's motto is Veritas in Caritate, translated as \\"Truth Through Caring\\" or \\"Truth Through Charity\\", and originates from the epitaph of Bishop Wordsworth's father.  History  cathedral spire is visible in the background. The school was founded in June 1889, when the Bishop of Salisbury, John Wordsworth, announced to his friend Canon Woodall, \\"I should like to see Salisbury a great educational centre. I should like to found a school which shall be equal to the greatest and best of our public schools.\\" His initial desire that working class boys were not to be admitted caused much controversy. Fees were initially set at ¬£1.10s.0d, and boarding fees were ¬£2 per term; however, the fees were raised to ¬£9 in 1894 to meet the unexpected costs of the school. During the first year, classes were taught in the bishop's palace of Salisbury itself. Bishop Wordsworth personally donated ¬£3000, which was used to purchase an area of land in the cathedral close and to build the school's first buildings. After Bishop Wordsworth's death, the school was renamed Bishop Wordsworth's School, having been previously known as \\"The Bishop's School\\". In 1905, the school became a grammar school, its buildings consisting of the current Chapel Block and Bishopgate. Between 1905 and 1927 the School also used buildings in the Friary and also on New Street in Salisbury. Until 1928 the school admitted both boys and girls, but from 1927, with the founding of a girls' grammar school in the city called South Wilts Grammar School, the school admitted boys only. In 1931 a hall, science laboratories and a library were built. By the 1930s, the school had achieved a reputation for pioneering educational work, and in 1936 became a public school. In 1948 the governors accepted voluntary controlled status, which meant being funded by Wiltshire County Council as local education authority and accepting its supervision. Boarding at the school in the Bishopgate buildings ended in the 1950s, and the buildings were used for teaching thereafter. During the Second World War, pupils from the Priory School in Portsmouth moved to BWS to avoid the bombing of the city. The school now educates boys aged 11 to 18. Sixth form classes are shared with students from South Wilts Grammar School as part of a large-scale collaboration. In 2002, a major redevelopment of the school's site and buildings commenced. A new classroom block and drama studio were followed by an extensive sports hall and physical education facilities, and a sixth form block was finished in July 2010. The old sports hall was converted to house the art department, and the design technology block has been expanded. In 2011 a new cookery room was completed. In 2004 the school was awarded its first specialism in Languages. In 2008 the school achieved an additional specialism in Science. As part of its specialist work the school has supported all of the city primary schools in Salisbury in Languages, and many with Science too. The school converted to academy status in 2011. It has five houses, named after Bishops of Salisbury: Poore, Osmund, Jewell, Martival and Ward. In 2009 a retired teacher who was being investigated for indecent assault killed himself by inhaling helium. Nicholas Bray was found dead at his home by police officers on 12 June 2009 after failing to attend an appointment at Salisbury Police Station. He had been arrested in 2007 for an assault dating back several years and was also being investigated for possessing indecent images. In 2016 the school was criticised for asking parents for money towards their sons' exam costs. One Bishop Wordsworth‚Äôs School parent said the school was not private and should not be \\"money grabbing\\".  Entrance  Entry to the school is regulated by the 11-plus. Applicants sit the test in Year 6, at the age of 10 or 11. The exams are held in September at the school itself. There are also limited twelve plus and thirteen plus admissions, similarly by examination. Sixth Form admission is administered by the head of Sixth Form, and is granted on the basis of GCSE results, a personal statement and recommendation from the candidate's former head of school. Current pupils must achieve more than six A*‚ÄìBs (including Maths and English) in their GCSEs to continue their studies in Sixth Form, as well as a relatively high grade in the options they propose to take.  Notable staff  upright=1.0 Sir William Golding, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, was a schoolmaster teaching Philosophy and English in 1939, then English and Religious Education from 1945 to 1962. Lord of the Flies was Golding's first book, written in 1954, and it is widely believed that its main characters were based on Golding's students. Golding also regularly sang with Bishop Wordsworth's School choir. He was known affectionately as \\"Scruff\\" by the pupils due to his sometimes unkempt hair and beard and his carefree dress sense. After Golding's death in 1993, the school choir sang at his memorial service in Salisbury Cathedral. In March 2005 a plaque was placed at the school to commemorate Golding's time as a teacher. In 2009 it was revealed that Golding once tried to sexually assault a teenager. Golding admitted in private papers that he had tried to sexually assault a 15-year-old girl during his teenage years. Headmaster Happold was also noted for the foundation of the \\"Company of Honour and Service\\".

The pins and part of escape wheel are visible at bottom center. The GIF is slowed down to make the mechanism movement easier to see. A Roskopf, pin-lever, or pin-pallet escapement is an inexpensive, less accurate version of the lever escapement, used in mechanical alarm clocks, kitchen timers, mantel clocks and, until the 1970s, cheap watches now known as pin lever watches. It was patented by German watchmaker Georges Frederic Roskopf in 1867, suggested to Roskopf by Jules Grossmann. An escapement is the mechanism in a mechanical timepiece that gives the balance wheel pushes to keep it moving back and forth, and releases the timepiece's gears to advance a fixed amount with each swing of the wheel, thus moving the hands forward at a steady rate. The pin pallet escapement is similar to the lever escapement, which is used in quality watches, except that the horizontal jewel pallets on the lever are replaced with vertical metal pins, and the shape of the escape wheel teeth is modified. The pin pallet escapement was widely used as it had many of the advantages of the lever escapement but was easier to manufacture. The pallets in a traditional lever escapement have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which engage the escape wheel teeth. They must be adjusted to precisely correct angles for the escapement to function. In the pin pallet escapement these faces are designed into the shape of the escape wheel teeth instead, eliminating the need for costly adjustments. However, the metal pins used instead of pallets have much higher friction than jewelled pallets, and combined with the looser manufacturing tolerances this made pin pallet timepieces less accurate. The metal pins also wear more quickly. Pin pallet timepieces are usually too cheap to justify repairing, and are usually thrown away when they break down or wear out. History Roskopf used the escapement in his visionary project to manufacture a 'laborer's watch', a pocket watch, which would sell for less than a week's wages of an unskilled laborer. The innovative Roskopf watch, which came out in 1876, won awards and was widely imitated, being made in various forms until about 1925. In the USA, the escapement was used in cheap dollar watches. It continued to be used in cheap wristwatches when they gained popularity after World War I. To keep costs down, pin-pallet watches usually didn't have any jeweled bearings, using plain steel bearings instead, although sometimes one jewel was incorporated for advertising purposes. An exception is Timex and Oris who in the 1960s produced fully jeweled pin-pallet watches. By 1980 inexpensive quartz watches took over the market for low-end watches which pin pallet watches had dominated, and production ceased. Quartz technology is gradually replacing the last uses of pin pallet movements in timers and alarm clocks. Brocot escapement Another escapement also called a \\"pin pallet escapement\\", unrelated to the Roskopf above, is the Brocot escapement, invented in 1823 by Louis-Gabriel BrocotFrench patent 02903 and improved by his son Achille, and used in 19th century French pendulum clocks. It is a variation of the anchor escapement in which the pallets are semicircular pins. The escapement is often revealed in a cutout on the clock's face.

To provide maximum tilt at the crossing point, there is a 90 degree phase advance from the first cavity to the interaction point (IP). The correcting crab cavity must then be placed a further 90 degrees from the IP to correct the tilt, since a kick can only be done to the momentum. Therefore there is a total of 180 degrees phase advance between the crab cavities, meaning that the momentum after the IP has the opposite sign as it was initially given. The correcting kick should thus have the same sign as the kick that created the crabbing. Crab cavities are a form of electromagnetic cavity used in particle accelerators to provide a transverse deflection to particle bunches. They can be used to provide rotation to a charged particle bunch by applying a time varying magnetic field. This rotation of the bunch can be used as a diagnostic tool to measure the length of a bunch (the longitudinal dimension is projected into the transverse plane, and imaged) or as a means of increasing the luminosity at an interaction point of a collider if the colliding beams cross each other at an angle (then called crab crossing).

It is located to the east of the Mare Serenitatis, in the northeastern quadrant of the Moon's near side. Coordinates of their center are , and their extent is about 170 km. Montes Taurus are rather unimpressive and indistinct compared to other named lunar mountain systems. It is a broad hilly region without sharp borders. These mountains reach maximal height between craters Kirchhoff and Newcomb (4.9 km above Mare Serenitatis and 2.1 km above mean level of lunar surface). A number of craters lie embedded within this range. At the southwestern edge of the region is the crater R√∂mer, and Newcomb is located in the northeastern section. Several satellite craters also lie throughout the Montes Taurus. Southwestern edge of this region hosts Taurus‚ÄìLittrow valley, the landing site of the manned Apollo 17 mission. Name The Montes Taurus are named after Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey. This name appeared on the lunar map due to Johannes Hevelius, who used to name lunar features after terrestrial ones. But he assigned this name (in the form Mons Taurus) to a completely different feature ‚Äî one of bright rays of crater Tycho. The item of this article was designated as Taurica Chersonnesus, because Hevelius tried to establish a correspondence between lunar regions and regions of vicinity of Mediterranean sea, and on his map this lunar region corresponded to Crimea (historically known as Tauris or Tauric Chersonese).

Today, it is considered \\"England's most important Modernist periodical.\\"Edwards 144. History The Egoist was founded by Dora Marsden as a successor to her feminist magazine The New Freewoman, but was changed, under the influence of Ezra Pound, into a literary magazine. Pound got his benefactor John Quinn to buy him an editorial position in the magazine, and quickly it became a leading publication for imagist poetry.Benstock 364-65. Its group of friends and contributors includes almost every writer of significance of the time, though some, like D. H.

In November 2003, he was sentenced to three life terms for three murders, but he may have killed up to nine people. Early life Born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England, Hardy had an apparently uneventful childhood and excelled in school and college. He earned an engineer's degree from Imperial College London and subsequently became the manager of a large company. Hardy married and fathered three sons and one daughter; in 1982, he was arrested in Tasmania for trying to drown his wife, but the charges were later dropped. In 1986, she divorced him, accusing him of domestic violence. After the divorce, Hardy spent time in mental hospitals, diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He lived in various hostels in London, picking up convictions for theft and being drunk and disorderly. He was arrested in 1998 when a prostitute accused him of raping her, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. He became an alcoholic and diabetic. Murders In January 2002, police were called to the block of flats where Hardy lived by a neighbour complaining that someone had vandalised her front door and that she strongly suspected Hardy. When the police investigated Hardy's flat, they found a locked door and, despite his claims to the contrary, found that Hardy had a key to it. In the room the police found the naked dead body of a woman lying on a bed with cuts and bruises to her head. She was identified as Sally White, 38, a sex worker who had been living in London. Forensic pathologist Freddy Patel subsequently concluded that White had died of a heart attack, in spite of the circumstances. Patel later came under scrutiny for this and other findings in his career, including the 2009 death of Ian Tomlinson, resulting in a suspension from the government's register of pathologists pending an inquiry. In 2012, his name was erased from the medical register by the General Medical Council, meaning that he can no longer practise medicine in the United Kingdom. Hardy pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal damage and claimed he had no knowledge of how White came to be in his flat due to his drinking problem. Whilst in custody Hardy was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983, remaining there until November 2002. Arrest and trial On 30 December 2002, a homeless man scavenging for food in bins found some of the dismembered remains of two women, stuffed into bin-liners. The victims were identified as Bridgette MacClennan, 34, and Elizabeth Valad, 29. The investigation led to Hardy, who was arrested a week later. He had gone on the run, but was spotted by an off-duty policeman when he went to Great Ormond Street Hospital to collect his prescription for insulin. During a search of the grounds of the hospital, Hardy was found hiding behind bins. A fight took place as he resisted arrest, during the course of which a police officer was knocked unconscious and another officer was stabbed through the hand and had his eye dislocated from its socket. Despite suffering these injuries, the wounded police officer held Hardy until backup arrived and he was arrested at the scene. A subsequent search of his flat found evidence, including old blood stains, indicating the two women had been killed and dismembered there. Both had died over the Christmas holidays. Under arrest, Hardy simply replied \\"no comment\\" to every question put to him by police. He was eventually charged with the murders of both MacClennan and Valad, and of White, the woman whose death had originally been put down to natural causes. At his trial in November 2003 Hardy, despite his initial lack of cooperation with the police, abruptly changed his plea to guilty to all three counts of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Because of Hardy's history of psychiatric problems and violent behaviour, an independent enquiry was announced into his care. It has been reported that police believe Hardy is possibly connected to the unsolved cases of two prostitutes found dismembered and dumped in the River Thames, and up to five or six other murders that bore marked similarities to the ones for which he was convicted, but where not enough evidence is available directly implicating him. Hardy has been diagnosed with a personality disorder. In May 2010, a High Court judge decided that Hardy should never be released from prison, placing him on the list of whole life tariff prisoners. Mr Justice Keith, sitting in London, said: \\"This is one of those exceptionally rare cases in which life should mean life.\\"  In popular culture  Hardy was the subject of an episode of Evil Up Close on the Crime and Investigation Network, focusing on the 2010 decision to keep Hardy in prison for the rest of his life. The film was directed by Robert Murray and written and produced by Will Hanrahan. After Hardy was imprisoned British rap artist Plan B released a song about Hardy, dubbing him the 'Camden Ripper'. Hardy is also mentioned, and his flat pointed out, in the music video \\"Guided tour of Camden\\" by Charlie Sloth. Hardy was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, The Hunt for the Camden Ripper, broadcast in 2004. It was narrated by Juliet Stevenson and directed by Olly Lambert.

The film was #57 on the year-end list of the top-grossing films of 1966. It was titled California Holiday in the UK. Plot Mike McCoy (Elvis Presley), the lead singer for a traveling band who is also a part-time race car driver, enjoys his carefree single life, which is threatened by three different women who seek to marry him. Enter Cynthia Foxhugh (Shelley Fabares), a spoiled heiress and \\"daddy's girl,\\" who is determined to get what she wants, no matter the cost. Such as was the case when Cynthia's millionaire father Howard (Carl Betz) tricks Mike and his band into interrupting their music tour to travel to Santa Barbara and serenade Cynthia with \\"Am I Ready\\" for her birthday. Cynthia becomes first of the three women who want to marry Mike. Also, apparently knowing about Mike's racing skills, Howard is determined to hire Mike to drive Howard's Fox Five car in an upcoming road race, but Mike prefers to race his own car, a Cobra 427 sports car, which he tows around the region with his 1929 Model J Duesenberg. Meanwhile, Mike is stalked and spied upon by Diana St. Clair (Diane McBain), an author of books for women about men. Diana is in the process of writing her new book, The Perfect American Male, and uses Mike as one of her subjects. Actually, she later reveals to Mike that he is the \\"perfect American male,\\" thereby planning on Mike to marry her‚Äîto the point of already making wedding arrangements. The female drummer of Mike's band, Les (Deborah Walley), is looked upon by Mike and the other band members as a tomboy, and becomes fed up with such treatment. Mike and his other band members are taken aback when at a party, Les picks her moment and reveals her true feminine side, walking back out from a room dressed up in an evening dress. She reveals herself as the third woman who wishes to marry Mike. Faced with this predicament, Mike must decide which of the three women he will marry‚Äîafter the race (which Mike wins in a car he does not even own). So, he decides to marry all three of them‚Äîto other men. Mike marries Cynthia to Phillip (Warren Berlinger), a nervous employee of Howard's who is prone to fainting (he had a secret crush on Cynthia since he has known her, which he finally picks up the nerve to tell her). Next, Mike marries Diana to Howard, who fell in love with each other after they met at one of Mike's parties. And finally, Mike marries Les to Lt. Tracy Richards (Will Hutchins), a police officer whom Les won her way to his heart through his stomach (he likes her gourmet cooking). This allows Mike to reclaim his single and carefree life, which he dearly enjoys.

Elvis was paid $750,000 plus 40% of the profits.Michael A. Hoey, Elvis' Favorite Director: The Amazing 52-Film Career of Norman Taurog, Bear Manor Media 2013 The racing scenes were shot at Paramount Ranch Raceway. The script was written by Theodore Flicker and George Kirgo. They originally pitched the idea of a film based on Presley's life, but this was vetoed by Col. Parker. Working titles include Never Say No, Never Say Yes, and The Singing Racing Car Driver. Flicker eventually left the project to work on The President's Analyst and Michael Hoey worked on the script uncredited with Kirgo. There is a scene in the film where Mike was discussing with his band members the pitfalls of marriage and settling down, and Mike mentions being on the Ed Sullivan Show. This line was likely written as an inside joke to Elvis' 1956 appearances on Ed Sullivan. Jack Mullaney, who also appeared with Elvis in Tickle Me (1965), plays Curly, one of the male band members. Jimmy Hawkins, who plays Larry, the other male band member, also appeared with both Presley and Fabares in Girl Happy and coincidentally portrayed one of Presley's band members in that film, as well. Carl Betz (Howard) and Shelley Fabares (Cynthia) had played father and daughter before, on The Donna Reed Show. Soundtrack Reception A. H. Weiler of The New York Times called the film a \\"minor variation\\" on Presley's previous pictures. Variety declared it \\"an entertaining Elvis Presley comedy-tuner ... Well-produced by Joe Pasternak and directed with verve by Norman Taurog.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"perhaps [Presley's] best picture yet,\\" with a \\"first-rate\\" cast, while writers Theodore J. Flicker and George Kirgo \\"have managed to parody the typical Presley plot so deftly that they neither insult Elvis nor alienate his devoted fans.\\"Thomas, Kevin. \\"'Spinout' Best of Elvis Films\\". Los Angeles Times. November 25, 1966. Part IV, p. 30. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the film was \\"delivered with sufficient joie de vivre to make its nonsensical compound of ballad and beat, car racing and unlikely romantic complication, entertaining enough in its own way,\\" though the review noted that Presley \\"largely maintains a rather morose demeanour\\" throughout the film and that \\"even his singing style seems to have lost some of its old bounce and energy.\\" Filmink felt Presley and Fabares had none of the chemistry they showed in Girl Happy.

The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines utilize just-in-time compilation for improved performance. JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model. The use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers. For example, the Chrome V8 engine is a core component of the popular Node.js and Deno runtime systems. Since ECMAScript (ES) is the standardized specification of JavaScript, ECMAScript engine is another name for these engines. History The first JavaScript engine was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the Netscape Navigator web browser. It was a rudimentary interpreter for the nascent language Eich invented. (This evolved into the SpiderMonkey engine, still used by the Firefox browser.) The first modern JavaScript engine was V8, created by Google for its Chrome browser. V8 debuted as part of Chrome in 2008, and its performance was much better than any prior engine. The key innovation was just-in-time compilation, which can significantly improve execution times. Other browser vendors needed to overhaul their interpreters to compete. Apple developed the Nitro engine for its Safari browser, which had 30% better performance than its predecessor.Safari 5 Released Mozilla leveraged portions of Nitro to improve its own SpiderMonkey engine.

About AP Television News is the video division of the Associated Press. It provides many of the world's broadcasters with a round-the-clock continuous feed of news, sports, entertainment and feature video content. Associated Press Television News Ltd. is a UK corporation owned and controlled by the Associated Press. Headquartered in North London, AP Television News was founded in 1994 as Associated Press Television or APTV. They moved to their present headquarters in 1999 when APTV bought out competitor Worldwide Television News (WTN) and hired Roberto FE Soto as their first NYC Bureau Chief.A.P. Buys Worldwide Television News The WTN building and facilities located at 1995 Broadway were deemed more suitable than the existing AP headquarters and Soto redesigned the newsroom, where APTN NY stayed until AP moved their operations to W 33 street in New York City, and later to 200 Liberty Street in New York City in 2017, where they remain. Since its rebranding in 2005, the APTN name and logo has been dropped in favour of \\"AP Television News\\", featuring the red AP logo of the Associated Press to emphasise its connection to the AP. However, many broadcasters still refer to the television organisation as APTN. Services APTN distributes video to its client broadcasters around the world, mostly by satellite. Many major broadcasters and networks rely heavily upon APTN for major breaking news from around the world. The company also provides specialised \\"Broadcast Services\\" for its clients, such as editing, crewing or satellite feeds from news and sports events. Historical footage is also made available from its extensive film and video archives, which date back to 1895. It includes the film and video archives of onetime AP rival UPI's longtime newsfilm service United Press International Television News, which was the original agency that became WTN. APTN is based in North London (in a former gin warehouse on the Regent's Canal called \\"The Interchange\\" because its original function was to interchange freight between the canal and rail systems) with bureaus in 85 cities and 79 nations, including New York City, Washington D.C., Paris, Rome and Moscow; as well as current-event regions such as Iraq and Afghanistan. It uses fibre-optic and satellite-based distribution networks to relay video footage to TV networks and newsrooms. (Broadcasters based in London receive the APTN video feed by local terrestrial circuits, known as \\"local ends,\\" via the BT Tower.) =Use of video= Video news agencies such as APTN (AFP TV and Reuters TV) typically do not produce programmes that TV owners could watch. Rather, they provide footage of an event with only natural sound and very loose editing. However, APTN does also produce a range of entertainment and special interest programmes that are provided as white-label products for client use. Agency customers, who are local and national TV stations, documentary producers, cable television news channels, and the like, edit the agency footage to suit their style, and add their own graphics and voice-overs before transmission. The premise for a video news agency is simple: very few TV stations devote enough money to newsgathering to put hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of camera, editing, and satellite transmission equipment everywhere that news might happen. Video news agencies provide rapid response coverage and international reach for those TV stations. The agency obtains footage from their own camera crews, arrangements with local TV broadcasters to redistribute their material, material shot by freelancers who sell their footage to the agencies, and on rare occasions footage shot by the public (such as the famous footage of the 2000 crash of an Air France Concorde outside Paris and the hijacked Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, which ditched off the Comoro Islands in 1996) Footage shot with broadcast-quality cameras is preferred, but quality can sometimes come second to content or immediacy for an exclusive story. The maintenance of a network of local bureaux by the agencies means that local staff with expert knowledge are on hand to capture footage in places where Western camera crews could be in danger. An example of this is the Kosovo War in Serbia during which most journalists left the country prior to the NATO bombing campaign. In addition, TV reporters who often do not have the budgets or expertise to carry with a full satellite uplink are able to use the local agency bureaux. AP Television News has a department called \\"Broadcast Services\\" which specialises in providing on site production and transmission facilities either through the AP bureaux infrastructure or at breaking or set-piece news events. APTN managed to get a satellite dish and transmission gear into Banda Aceh, Indonesia, following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake before the region was closed to air traffic.

Legal basis Article 38 of the Constitution of Ireland empowers the D√°il to establish \\"special courts\\" with wide-ranging powers when the \\"ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice\\". The Offences against the State Act 1939 led to the establishment of the Special Criminal Court for the trial of certain offences. The scope of a \\"scheduled offence\\" is set out in the Offences Against the State (Scheduled Offences) Order 1972 as encompassing offences under:Joseph Kavanagh v. Ireland, United Nations Human Rights Committee Communication No. 819/1998, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/71/D/819/1998 (2001). * Malicious Damage Act, 1861 * Explosive Substances Act 1883 * Firearms Act 1925 to 1971 * Offences against the State Act 1939 A further class of offences was added by Statutory Instrument later the same year under: * s.7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 Offenses under the Criminal Damage Act 1991 are also scheduled. * Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 =Scheduled offences= Offences covered under the laws are known as \\"scheduled offences\\". The Special Criminal Court also has jurisdiction over non-scheduled offences where the Attorney-General certifies, under s.47(2) of the Offences against the State Act 1939, that in his or her opinion the ordinary courts are \\"inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice in relation to the trial of such person on such charge\\". The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) exercises these powers of the Attorney-General by delegated authority. History On 26 May 1972, the Government exercised its power to make a proclamation pursuant to Section 35(2) of the under the Offences against the State Act 1939 which led to the establishment of the Special Criminal Court for the trial of certain offences. The current court was first established by the D√°il under the Offences against the State Act 1939 to prevent the Irish Republican Army from subverting Ireland's neutrality during World War II and the Emergency.OFFENCES AGAINST THE STATE ACT, 1939 ‚Äî law establishing the court The current incarnation of the Special Criminal Court dates from 1972, just after the Troubles in Northern Ireland began. Although the court was initially set up to handle terrorism-related crime, its remit has been extended and it has been handling more organised crime cases after the Provisional IRA ceasefire in the 1990s. For instance, members of the drugs gang which murdered journalist Veronica Guerin were tried in the Special Criminal Court. Section 35(4) and (5) of the Offences against the State Act 1939 provide that if at any time the Government or the Parliament is satisfied that the ordinary courts are again adequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, a rescinding proclamation or resolution, respectively, shall be made terminating the Special Criminal Court regime; to date, no such rescinding proclamation or resolution has been promulgated. Following the introduction of a regular Government review and assessment procedure on 14 January 1997, reviews taking into account the views of the relevant State agencies were carried out on 11 February 1997, 24 March 1998, and 14 April 1999, have concluded that the continuance of the Court was necessary, not only in view of the continuing threat to State security posed by instances of violence, but also of the particular threat to the administration of justice, including jury intimidation, from the rise of organised and ruthless criminal gangs, principally involved in drug-related and violent crime. Structure; second court The court is composed of three judges appointed by the government from among the judges of the ordinary courts, usually one from the High Court, one from the Circuit Court and one from the District Court. The court sits as a three-judge panel with no jury, and verdicts are by majority vote. Verdicts can be appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal.The Special Criminal Court ‚Äî Irish government information websiteSpecial Criminal Court ‚Äî Courts Service website On 8 February 2016, the Minister for Justice and Equality Frances Fitzgerald announced that a second Special Criminal Court will open on 4 April 2016 following a Government decision to establish a second non-jury Special Criminal Court to try terrorist and crime-gang offences . Criticism The Special Criminal Court has been criticised by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties,ICCL press conference marking the 30th 'birthday' of the Special Criminal Court ‚Äî Irish Council for Civil Liberties criticisms of the court Amnesty InternationalSubmission to the Committee to Review the Offences Against the State Acts and Other Matters ‚Äî Amnesty International criticisms of the court and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE CONCLUDES SIXTY-NINTH SESSION ‚Äî United Nations Commission on Human Rights recommends the abolition of the court for its procedures and for being a special court, which ordinarily should not be used against civilians. Among the criticisms are the lack of a jury, and the increasing use of the court to try organised \\"ordinary\\" crimes rather than the terrorist cases it was originally set up to handle. Critics also argue that the court is now obsolete since there is no longer a serious terrorist threat to the State (see: Northern Ireland peace process), although others disagree and cite the continuing violence from dissident republican terrorism, international terrorism and serious gangland crime. Under the law, the court is authorised to accept the opinion of a Garda S√≠och√°na chief-superintendent as evidence that a suspect is a member of an illegal organisation. However, the court has been reluctant to convict on the word of a garda alone, without any corroborating evidence. The Sinn F√©in political party in the past stated that it is their intention to abolish the Special Criminal Court as they believed it was used to convict political prisoners in a juryless court, however Sinn F√©in are no longer in favour of its abolition.Special Criminal Court needs to be closed down not expanded ‚Äî comments by Sinn F√©in justice spokesperson Aengus √ì Snodaigh Some prominent Sinn F√©in members (including Martin Ferris and Martin McGuinness) have been convicted of offences by it.

He was convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment. Well-known cases * In 1976 Marie and Noel Murray were sentenced to death by the court for the capital murder of Garda Michael Reynolds. The convictions were overturned on appeal and they were instead sentenced to life in prison for \\"ordinary\\" murder.

It is a well known seaside resort that is considered to have some of the best surfing in the world. The city's economy is centered around surfing. Its inhabitants are called Hossegoriens.  Name  In 1913, the town associated the toponym of Hossegor, from the name of its marine lake, with its original name of Soorts. The root of Soorts is probably close to that of Sorde, the verb gascon s√≥rder or sordar, sourdre, meaning \\"where there are sources\\". Related names are Sor (Ari√®ge, Sort) and Sort-en-Chalosse (Landes) from the same Gascon etymon. The origin of Hossegor is more obscure: it may be an Aquitain or Basque name to be attached to the hydronyms osse and the adjective gorri,meaning \\"dry water\\". History Hossegor became a seaside resort in the early twentieth century. It is located between the cities of Biarritz and Arcachon. Initially, it attracted wealthy visitors from large cities like Paris. Some noteworthy visitors to Soorts-Hossegor have included J.H. Rosny in 1903 and Paul Margueritte in 1909. Other personalities later joined them, like Charles Derennes in 1913, then Maxime Leroy, Gaston Ch√©rau, Pierre Benoit, Tristan Dereme and Leon Blum in 1920. After the Second World War, the town attracted a wider selection of visitors, including industrialists, academics and doctors. From the 1920s, real estate programs increased the arrival of tourists in the resort. Some architects of the time became famous and embarked on many architectural projects. For example, in the early 1930s, the Gomez brothers built the Place des Landais: it was the first development of the waterfront in the town. This seafront was unique at the time. Indeed, the two architects, with a n√©o Basque architectural style, built aligned villas called in a style called \\"en bande\\". Many hotels were built at that time, such as Les Hortensias du Lac, a four-star luxury hotel with an extraordinary view of the marine lake, and the Mercedes, a three-star hotel near the city center overlooking the canal. The Sporting Casino was built in those years; it attracted an elegant and wealthy clientele. Today, it hosts various exhibitions and events. It has also become an influential sports complex with its swimming pool, tennis courts and a miniature golf course. Since the late 1990s, ultra-modern villas have been built in the resort. Privileged individuals build huge villas near the lake and golf course in the same architectural style. Climate  Sports and events  Municipal Stadium Soorts-Hossegor. Every year, at the end of September, the greatest surfers of the world meet on the beaches of Hossegor to compete in a race counting for the pro world championships: the Quiksilver Pro France. The French Surf Federation has its headquarters in Hossegor. Surfing is a big attraction for visitors and a very important tourist activity for Hossegor. It has long been one of the premier surfing locations in Europe, with a series of world-class beach breaks such as Gravi√®re and La Nord, and with nearby beach breaks in Capbreton and Seignosse such as La Piste and Bourdaines. In Hossegor there is also a large lake where many water activities can be enjoyed. The Landes forest is popular with nature lovers and cyclists. Each summer the Grand Prix des Landes takes place on the Hossegor golf course. The Hossegor Golf Club is in the national league for both men's and women's golfers. Golf is a popular activity in the Soorts- Hossegor region (and elsewhere on the Atlantic coast around Biarritz). Other sports available in the town are diving, tennis, horse riding and Basque pelote. Another event takes place during Easter weekend: the sale of \\"spirit surf\\" clothes. More than 100,000 people flock to the craft zone where the European headquarters of brands such as Rip Curl and Billabong are located, looking to purchase sport clothes. Population The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the census of the population carried out since 1793. Since 2006, this investigation has been conducted by INSEE and published annually. In 2015, the town had 3823 inhabitants, an increase of 2.69% compared to 2010. Image:hossegor2.jpgPlage Centrale.

Festival organization  The festival was established in 1994 by Max Wallace (Station Manager of the community radio station CKCU-FM and the festival's Director for its first two years of operation, 1994 & 1995) and Chris White (a local singer-songwriter) and a large committee of volunteers. First held on Victoria Island (Ottawa River) , it moved to Britannia in 1995 where it remained until 2010. From 2011‚Äì2014 the festival was held at Hog's Back Park in central Ottawa. The team behind Ottawa Bluesfest began to produce the festival in 2011. Currently the festival is held at Lansdowne Park. Mark Monahan is the current executive and artistic director.  History  The festival was established 15 years after the demise of the Festival for the Folks (1976‚Äì1979), a previous folk festival in Ottawa. The first Festival of the Folks (1976) was held in Brewer Park and organized by Sheldon Wilner (CUSA programmer) and Jim Wright (CUSA Finance Commissioner). The first Ottawa Folk Festival was held on Victoria Island, a small island between Ottawa and Gatineau in the Ottawa River. It ran only a single day, on August 28, 1994. Headliners on the inaugural festival included Valdy and David Wiffen. From this initial festival until 2006, the folk festival was formally known as the CKCU Ottawa Folk Festival acknowledging the support of the CKCU-FM radio station at Carleton University. In its second year, the festival moved to Britannia Park, a large park near historic Britannia village in the west end of Ottawa. Britannia Park was also home for the Festival of the Folks for its final three years, and would remain the folkfest's home until 2010. The festival was also extended to run for two days (Saturday and Sunday) that year; in 1996, it was extended to run three days beginning with Friday evening concerts. In 1996, the festival had cash flow problems that almost broke the organization. The festival retains close ties with Arlo Guthrie who performed at the two sold-out benefit concerts in that year that enabled the festival to continue. In more recent times the festival has turned toward the inclusion of non-folk and mainstream artists (such as a 2010 performance by Arrested Development and 2005 performance by Canadian Idol Kalan Porter) in an effort to boost attendance. The festival underwent major changes in 2011. Facing a heavy debt-load which was exacerbated by heavy rain and high winds on the final day of the festival in 2010, the festival board accepted an offer from Ottawa Bluesfest organizers to take over the running of the festival. The new management moved the festival to Hog's Back Park near Mooney's Bay along the Rideau River. In 2014 the festival was rebranded as CityFolk and relocated to Lansdowne Park.  Volunteers  The festival is supported by hundreds of volunteers, who are trained in specialty areas and allow the festival to operate. The volunteers collectively are the biggest sponsor in terms of how much their time contribution would cost the festival if these positions were paid. Students who are volunteers can receive Ontario high school credit for their participation.

Youth and early career Quillen was born in Syracuse, Kansas, near the Colorado border, and was reared in Overbrook, Kansas, a hamlet south of Topeka, where his father, J. D. Quillen, published the local newspaper.Moore, xi. According to Quillen, his paternal grandfather was a \\"dour, hard man, who made wonderful wagons and once took me by the seat of the pants and threw me into a watering trough because I had not obeyed him and remained away from it.\\" (83) Robert early learned to set type and as a teenager sold pen-and-ink drawings and published a monthly magazine.Moore, 84. In 1904, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Quillen joined the U.S. Army under an assumed name (swearing he was 21), but by mid-1905, he had been released from military service. He then spent a few months working for newspapers in the northeastern United States where he had been discharged.Moore, xii. Quillen published an autobiographical essay, \\"Concerning Me\\" on October 17, 1929 (Moore, 82-86). He did not mention his military service. In 1906, he answered an ad seeking an editor for a weekly that a publisher hoped to establish in Fountain Inn, South Carolina. Although after his first encounter he remained in Fountain Inn only three months, Quillen there met and married Donnie Cox, a milliner, five years his senior. He moved on to Americus, Georgia, and then took his new bride to Washington state, where Quillen joined forces with his father and worked at publishing newspapers and magazines in Winlock, Anacortes, and Port Orchard.Moore, xii- xiii. Quillen later wrote that he had gone \\"busted\\" in the West.Moore, xiii. Fountain Inn Tribune Quillen's Monument to Eve, 1925 \\"Last week the obelisk was erected in my yard, and I had the complacent feeling of one who has done his duty well. But one never knows. My neighbors stared at the marble with incredulous horror; they prophesied plagues upon me; they accused me of an unbecoming levity toward things that are sacred; they glared at the marble by day and scurried by with many a backward glance at night.\\" Moore, 8. In 1910, when his brother-in-law in Fountain Inn offered to sell him a weekly advertising sheet called News and Notions, Quillen bought it and borrowed money to purchase his own press and type. In the following year Quillen began editing and publishing the newly christened Fountain Inn Tribune, \\"a well- organized publication overflowing with news of Fountain Inn and outlying communities.\\" At first, as Quillen confessed two decades later, \\"the natives were a little hot under the collar\\" at what he called his \\"hypothetical cases\\"‚Äîthinly veiled descriptions of the locals‚Äîbut most soon warmed to him like an eccentric aunt. One Fountain Inn man warned a new preacher, \\"Don't get mad at anything Mr. Quillen says. We're used to him and just overlook his queerness.\\"Moore, xiv. Among other oddities, Quillen regularly wore a \\"cowboy- type Stetson,\\" raised a memorial to \\"Eve, the First Woman,\\" published his father's obituary before he died, used a column to advertise his interest in adopting a baby boy (\\"must be between three and twelve months of age\\"), and built himself a faux Greek temple as a work space‚Äîwhich he never used.Moore, xxi, 8 (December 17, 1925), xvi; Alexander Woollcott, \\"The Sage of Fountain Inn\\", Cosmopolitan (September 1933), 69. Quillen thought it shameful that people waited until \\"it was too late to say nice things about those they loved and admired.\\" Quillen's office and library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in January 2012. Facile with words, Quillen took inconsistent political, economic, and racial positions; but he was \\"not afraid to bare his soul, express personal views, and even vent scorn and anger.\\"Moore, xvi. For instance, in 1943, Quillen wrote that \\"the mixing of races violates the law of nature,\\" and he sought to defend \\"racial purity.\\" Robert Quillen, \\"Leaders Can't Get Anywhere Till They Tell People What Their Goal Is,\\" Atlanta Constitution, November 1, 1943, 6. For instance, he hated patent medicine, people who put on airs, late night noises (both human and natural), and the cats and jays that killed his beloved song birds.Moore, xiii, 263, 147-48, 260-61, 154-55, 262-63, 317. Although a shy man who refused to speak in public, he became something of a \\"one-man welfare and relief agency for the poor and needy of Fountain Inn.\\"Moore, xvii, xxi. In 1984, a friend, Lois Woods, told a reporter that if \\"a child found an empty stocking on Christmas morning, it was because Quillen and his wife Marcelle didn't know about it.\\" [Greenville] County Fare (October 17, 1984), 3. Meanwhile, Quillen engaged in a \\"never ending struggle\\" to make the Fountain Inn Tribune pay its own way.Moore, xvii. With fewer than a thousand subscribers, the newspaper itself was probably never profitable, but Quillen used the ideas generated in Fountain Inn as the basis for pieces that appeared in scores of leading national magazines and newspapers. Twice, frustrated with the time it took to run the weekly, he sold the paper (notoriously in 1926 for one dollar) and twice bought it back.Moore, xix-xx. The buyback after the dollar sale apparently cost Quillen about two thousand dollars. In 1929, Quillen called the Tribune \\"my hobby‚Äîmy substitute for golf.\\"\\"Concerning Me,\\" October 17, 1929 (Moore, 85). Syndicated journalist By 1932 his work, which included editorials, paragraphs, cartoons, and one-liners, was regularly appearing in four hundred newspapers in the United States, Canada, England, and the Far East.Moore, xi. Quillen wrote for such major periodicals such as the Baltimore Sun, the Saturday Evening Post, and The American Magazine, and he \\"took the greatest pride\\" in one-liners picked up by Literary Digest. According to a biographer, he was known as the best \\"paragrapher\\" of his day.Moore, xviii- xix, xxi. With the assistance of Chicago newspaper executive Eugene P. Conley (co-founder of the Publishers Syndicate),Watson, Elmo Scott. \\"The Era of Consolidation, 1890-1920\\" (Chapter VII), in A History Of Newspaper Syndicates In The United States, 1865-1935 (Western Newspaper Union, 1936), archived at Stripper's Guide Quillen also syndicated two single-panel cartoons (drawn by John H. Striebel), Aunt Het and Willie Willis ‚Äî the latter of which was translated into Dutch as Pimmie Pimmel. As early as 1924, Quillen's income from syndicated material alone was probably more than $25,000 ‚Äî easily ten times that amount in early 21st-century dollars.Moore, xvii; MeasuringWorth.com. Well into his forties, Quillen hoped to become a great novelist. Macmillan published his two novels, One Man's Religion (1923) and The Path Wharton Found (1924). The first was \\"little more than a loose collection of pieces first published in the Saturday Evening Post,\\" the second, a book which one reviewer called a \\"good enough conventional story, hampered by neither originality nor brilliancy.\\"Moore, xix; Springfield Republican (November 30, 1924), 7. A decade later Quillen referred to these books as \\"fortunately out of print.\\"Moore, xix. In 1934 Hollywood screen writer Lamar Trotti and producer George Marshall visited Quillen to use him as a prototype for a Will Rogers film, Life Begins at 40, in which Rogers played a small-town newspaper editor. The film credits mentioned Quillen for \\"contributing dialogue.\\"Moore, 249; \\"Correction,\\" October 18, 1934, in Moore, 276-77. \\"That was all that happened. I spent four pleasant afternoons with two pleasant gentlemen and got paid for it, and that's as near as I'll ever come to bein' in the movies.'\\" Personal life Unable to find the adoptive son for whom he had advertised, Quillen and his wife adopted a baby girl, Louise, to whom Quillen later wrote a noted series of public epistles, \\"Letters from a Bald-Headed Dad to His Red-Headed Daughter.\\" Shortly after the adoption, his wife died following routine surgery. In 1922, Quillen married another woman from Fountain Inn, Marcelle Babb.Moore, xviii-xix. Despite years of ill health, Quillen continued to smoke and avoid doctors.In 1932, when he was 45, Quillen signed a photo of himself smoking with the words, \\"from an old wreck.\\" [Greenville] County Fare (October 17, 1984), 3. He died at a nursing home in Asheville, North Carolina in 1948 and was buried in Fountain Inn.Moore, xviii; Greenville News, December 9, 1948. More than sixty years after his death, Quillen was named to the South Carolina Press Association Hall of Fame. Greenville News, March 15, 2009. Not surprisingly, he had written and published his own obituary sixteen years earlier, which read in part, \\"He was a writer of paragraphs and short editorials. He always hoped to write something of permanent value, but the business of making a living took most of his time and he never got around to it. In his youth he felt an urge to reform the world, but during the latter years of his life he decided that he would be doing rather well if he kept himself out of jail.\\"\\"Obituary,\\" March 24, 1932, in Moore, 181-82.

In this example the perianth is separated into a calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals) The perianth (perigonium, perigon or perigone) is the non-reproductive part of the flower, and structure that forms an envelope surrounding the sexual organs, consisting of the calyx (sepals) and the corolla (petals). The term perianth is derived from the Greek œÄŒµœÅŒØ, peri, meaning around, and Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ, anthos, meaning flower, while perigonium is derived from gonos, meaning seed, i.e. sexual organs. In the mosses and liverworts (Marchantiophyta), the perianth is the sterile tubelike tissue that surrounds the female reproductive structure (or developing sporophyte).  Flowering plants  In flowering plants, the perianth may be described as being either dichlamydeous/heterochlamydeous in which the calyx and corolla are clearly separate, or homochlamydeous, in which they are indistinguishable (and the sepals and petals are collectively referred to as tepals). When the perianth is in two whorls, it is described as biseriate. While the calyx may be green, known as sepaloid, it may also be brightly coloured, and is then described as petaloid. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are also referred to as \\"petaloid\\", as in petaloid monocots, orders of monocots with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include Liliales, an alternative name is lilioid monocots. The corolla and petals have a role in attracting pollinators, but this may be augmented by more specialised structures like the corona (see below). When the corolla consists of separate tepals the term apotepalous is used, or syntepalous if the tepals are fused to one another. The petals may be united to form a tubular corolla (gamopetalous or sympetalous). If either the petals or sepals are entirely absent, the perianth can be described as being monochlamydeous. Both sepals and petals may have stomata and veins, even if vestigial. In some taxa, for instance some magnolias and water lilies, the perianth is arranged in a spiral on nodes, rather than whorls. Flowers with spiral perianths tend to also be those with undifferentiated perianths. = Corona = Flower of Narcissus showing an outer white corolla with a central yellow corona (paraperigonium) Flower of Passiflora incarnata showing corona of fine appendages between petals and stamens An additional structure in some plants (e.g. Narcissus, Passiflora (passion flower), some Hippeastrum, Liliaceae) is the corona (paraperigonium, paraperigon, or paracorolla), a ring or set of appendages of adaxial tissue arising from the corolla or the outer edge of the stamens. It is often positioned where the corolla lobes arise from the corolla tube. The pappus of Asteraceae, considered to be a modified calyx, is also called a corona if it is shaped like a crown. Ligulate floret, typical for some members of the family Asteraceae: A. inferior ovary B. The calyx is a crown-shaped pappus, called a corona. C.
