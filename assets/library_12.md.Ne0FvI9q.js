He was originally from the diocese of Nevers. He went to Rome and became a subdeacon and then a papal notary before 1200. By the influence of Pope Innocent III, he was elected to the vacant see of Porto Torres in 1202. He was consecrated sometime before 7 March 1203. One of his first acts was to order the giudici to punish the murderers of the bishop of Ploaghe, the abbot of Tregu, and the vicar of Camaldoli. On 10 March 1203, the pope put Comita III of Logudoro under the protection of Biagio and not of Pisa in light of the invasion of Logudoro by William I of Cagliari. On 22 March, with papal consent, he gave Christian burial to Comita's father, Constantine II, who had died excommunicate. In a letter dated that same day to Comita, William, and Hugh I of Arborea, the pope ordered the giudici to take an oath of allegiance to Biagio, thus breaking their link of fidelity to Pisa. Biagio had trouble extracting the oath from William, who had previously made it to Uberto, Archbishop of Pisa. On 15 September, Innocent absolved William of the oath. In that year, Barisone II of Gallura died and left the succession to Gallura in the hands of the pope, who gave Biagio the responsibility of arranging a marriage for the Gallurese heiress Elena. In 1203, he tried to marry her to Ittocorre of Torres and in 1206 to Trasmondo, a relative of the pope's, but both of these arrangements fell through, and Elena married Lamberto di Eldizio without Biagio's approval, but with the support of the local clergy, who detested Logudorese supremacy. In a letter of 3 July 1204, Innocent confirmed the apostolic legateship to Uberto of Pisa only while he was on the island. Then the three Sardinian archbishops -- Biagio, Riccus of Cagliari, and Bernard of Arborea -- excommunicated the giudici for trying to solve their problems in the saecular forum (i.e., through war). Biagio maintained good relations with Comita. He offered to divorce Comita from his wife if he would abandon his mistress and he revoked the excommunication of Comita's relative, Ittocorre de Thoris, for murdering the bishop of Ampurias. Biagio did not have a good relationship with the other giudici, however. He had to reprove Hugh of Arborea and the archbishop of Cagliari for the incestuous marriage of Hugh to a daughter of William of Cagliari (27 October 1207). On 3 September 1211, he accused William of violence against women and the usurpation of Arborea. However, Biagio's relationship with the papacy soon deteriorated and Innocent ordered him to confirm the marriage alliance between the houses of Bas (Arborea) and Massa (Cagliari). Nevertheless, in April 1213, Innocent gave the right to him and the archbishop of Cagliari of preaching the Fifth Crusade in Sardinia. Biagio died less than two years later, probably at Cagliari.

It is mostly known as the ancestral seat of the Camaldolese monastic order, originated in the eponymous hermitage, which can still be visited. The name was derived from Tedald's diploma of 1027 in which he writes that the church is located \\"in loco qui dicitur Campo Malduli\\" - 'in a place which is named Maldolo's field'.https://www.camaldolicultura.it/en/storia/ Overview The Holy Hermitage and Monastery of Camaldoli is situated in an ancient forest in the Tuscan Apennines. It was founded about 1012 by Saint Romuald, a Benedictine monk, with the permission of Tedald, Bishop of Arezzo.Camaldoli community marks first millennium In the monastery of Camaldoli there is a welcoming room, a great hall, and an old style pharmacy. The pharmacy was originally a laboratory where monks studied and worked with medicinal herbs. These medicines would be used in the old hospital which can still be visited today. The precious walnut decor dates back to 1543. The church, meanwhile, was constructed in the Baroque style and contains works by Giorgio Vasari. It was established to deal with the ever-growing number of pilgrims - drawn by good reports of the monks, and for reflection in the middle of the forest. A few kilometers farther up the mountain is the \\"Sacred Hermitage,\\" or Sacro Eremo which is the more ancient part of the foundation. It was personally established by St. Romuald and has served as the heart of both the community and the order, which bears the location's name. An important document of Political Catholicism in Italy, the Codice di Camaldoli, was drafted in the monastery in July, 1943.

On final approach to Auburn/Lewiston Municipal Airport, the Bar Harbor Airlines Beechcraft Model 99 crashed short of the runway, killing all six passengers and two crew on board. Among the passengers was Samantha Smith, a thirteen-year-old American schoolgirl who had become famous as a \\"Goodwill ambassador\\" to the Soviet Union and who had been cast on the television show Lime Street.  Timeline  Flight 1808 normally stopped en route at Augusta and Waterville, Maine. The flight crew was made up of Captain Roy W. Fraunhofer and First Officer David C. Owen. The two had flown the aircraft from Bangor to Boston and back earlier that afternoon in worsening weather. On the second trip, they were advised at an en route stop in Augusta that because of air traffic control delays in Boston, their return flight 1788 via Auburn/Lewiston, Maine, was being cancelled. They would instead operate the later flight 1808 with Auburn added as a flag stop to accommodate passengers from flight 1788. Flight 1808 boarded in Boston with 6 passengers; two for Auburn, three for Augusta and one for Waterville. A fourth passenger had actually checked in for Augusta, but did not respond to boarding calls, so the flight left without him. At 21:17 EDT, the captain radioed for clearance to Auburn. The controller, unaware of the change in routing, advised Flight 1808 was filed to Augusta. The captain accepted the routing, but advised he would amend the flight plan to Auburn after passing Pease VOR, near Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Flight 1808 departed the ramp at 21:26 and was cleared for takeoff from runway 4L at 21:30. Flight track from NTSB accident report At about 22:00, Flight 1808 radioed the station agent at Auburn/Lewiston Municipal Airport for the latest weather. The agent reported a obscured, indefinite ceiling with visibility of in light drizzle and winds of 020° (north-northeast) at . The altimeter setting was supposed to be . Shortly after this call, a controller in Portland contacted Flight 1808 to advise that they were drifting east of the ILS approach course to runway 4 at Auburn. He advised them to turn to heading 340 to intercept. The captain responded \\"OK.” Almost a minute later, the controller advised Flight 1808 that they were passing the Lewie NDB beacon at the outer marker for the approach and asked if they were receiving the signal. The first officer responded \\"Affirmative.” The controller then cleared Flight 1808 to switch to the Auburn airport's frequency. This transmission was acknowledged by Flight 1808’s first officer and was the last transmission received from the flight. Portland controllers were notified less than 10 minutes later that the plane had crashed at 22:05.  Investigation  In the aftermath of the accident, investigators were hindered by the absence of information from either a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder. The Beech 99 was not large enough for the FAA to require the installation of either piece of equipment. There was also no record of which pilot was flying the aircraft. Adding to the confusion, both pilots had used the radio during the flight. Typically, the non-flying pilot handles communications. It took more than three months to transcribe the communications between the plane and ground control and provide them to investigators. Examination of radar data from Portland showed that after Flight 1808 turned to heading 340 to intercept the approach, it flew through the approach course and had to make a 60° turn less than one mile from the outer marker to get back on course. Altitude data from the aircraft’s transponder showed Flight 1808 did not begin its descent to intercept the precision approach until after passing Lewiston, when the plane was already above the glide slope for the approach. This may have caused the flight crew to rush both the descent and the approach and descend too steeply. The actual altimeter settings on both the captain's and the first officer's altimeters could not be determined due to fire and impact damage to the instruments. The aircraft flew into trees less than from the end of runway 4 and struck the ground less than to the right of the extended runway center line. There were no survivors. In its report, the National Transportation Safety Board noted that the controller in Portland used \\"poor judgment\\" while assisting the flight. However, it concluded that the captain accepted the large course correction and the crew continued flying an unstabilized approach instead of executing a missed approach. The flight crew also attempted to stabilize the approach while allowing the plane to fly below the glide slope of the approach. The setting on Flight 1808 altimeters may have been incorrect and contributed to the flight crew descending below the published decision height for the approach. At night and in low visibility, the crew may have been unaware of their true position. The NTSB recommended a review of controller procedures for outlying airports without ground radar to align with best practices. For example, the 60° turn less than from the outer marker for the approach at Auburn was made directed by the Portland controller even though that same maneuver would have violated approach guidelines for radar-assisted arrivals at Portland International Jetport. The NTSB further recommended that aircraft-for-hire capable of carrying six or more passengers be equipped with flight recorders. Passengers Samantha Smith memorial stamp issued by the USSR. This accident attracted unusual media attention for a small commuter plane accident. Two of the three passengers headed for Augusta were Samantha Smith and her father, who were returning from London, England, at the time. Three years earlier she had written to Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov regarding her desire for peace between the United States and the Soviet Union. Andropov, in his reply, invited her and her family to tour the Soviet Union. In 1985, ABC hired her to be an actress on its new show Lime Street, which was filmed on location in London. She and her father were headed home during a break from shooting when the fatal accident occurred. Jane Smith, Samantha's mother, filed a wrongful death suit against Bar Harbor Airlines. The case was later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

It has since relocated its settlement house to East Liberty (Pittsburgh) where it continues to operate today. It has also expanded to operate the Lillian Taylor Camp, an open air farm in Valencia, Pennsylvania and the Morgan Memorial House in the Hill District of Pittsburgh. The Kingsley Association seeks to create new and innovative, neighborhood-based programs in accordance with the changing needs of residents, with particular attention to young people.Records of the Kingsley Association, 1894–1980, AIS 70:5, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh. Founding The Kingsley Association was formed by the Reverend Dr. George Hodges (theologian) from Cambridge, Massachusetts as a Pittsburgh settlement house. According to an article written in 1894, Dr. Hodges had come to Pittsburgh under the auspices of the Church club.Davis, Allen F. Spearheads for Reform: The Social Settlements 1890–1914. New York: Oxford University Press, 1967. In Cambridge he had served as the Dean of the Episcopal Divinity School . He named the house in honor of Charles Kingsley, a very popular English Christian Socialist and author. After analyzing the titles of Hodges' books, it is obvious that his admiration for Kingsley was because of his status as a religious writer, not as a Socialist. Purpose The purpose for the creation of the Kingsley House was not much different from that of any other settlement house. Hodges had simply repeated what Jane Addams had done with Hull House in Chicago and what many other settlement houses across the nation had done to benefit the communities they were located in. The real purpose of the Kingsley House and these other settlement houses was to provide social and educational opportunities for working class families that otherwise would not be able to afford it. Hodges, himself, described the Kingsley House as existing “for the purpose of being a friend to everybody in the neighborhood who needs a friend.” He was referring to the Kingsley House existing just as a friend does, as a source of enjoyment and support in times of need. One example was the kindergarten, where young children whose families could probably not afford formal schooling could find a good education for their children. The school also served as a place for children to meet and socialize with other children of the same age. The Reverend Dr. George Hodges The purpose of what had become the Kingsley Association was flowing and ever- changing. When the Lillian Taylor Camp was created the purpose was to allow inner city children and mothers to spend time away from the congested and noisy city out in the quiet and serene countryside. It was also used as a summer camp to act as an extension of the Kingsley House while also getting children away from the city and to experience something other than what they had been used to all of their lives. Another change came with the influx of African Americans in the late 1910s and the creation of the Morgan Memorial House to accommodate this. While the guests of the Kingsley House had come from industrial backgrounds, many of the guests of Morgan Memorial House were experiencing for the first time the life and ways of a city. Thus, the Morgan Memorial House tended to concentrate its classes and activities more along the lines of adapting these children to city life. Lifting and education were more emphasized compared to the other parts of the Kingsley Association. The purpose of the Kingsley Association cannot be restrained to one definition and as it has increased in size and Pittsburgh's demographics have changed so too has the Association's purpose and contributions to the community. Membership At first the Kingsley Association was located at 1707 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA. It was close to several large iron and steel mills. It catered to a very diverse population. The surrounding area consisted mostly of factory workers that was predominantly Irish American, but in time came to include German, Russian, and Austrian Poles. A little farther were large settlements of Jewish and German immigrants with people of English and Scots- Irish descent present as well. A major shift from these ethnic groups occurred in 1919. The businesses in major cities had been experiencing a labor shortage because of World War I and they looked to African Americans to fill the gap. Most of the African-American population that moved into Pittsburgh settled in the Hill District. Another settlement house, the Morgan Memorial House, was created by the Kingsley Association to account for this surge in the population, after which the membership of the Association as a whole became a large percentage African-American. Within weeks of the opening of Kingsley House, there were five boys clubs and four girls clubs, ranging from American history to fairy tales. The sewing class had an average attendance of thirty girls beginning in January. Other clubs included the “Kingsley House Literary Society,” a “City Government Club,” and a “Reading Club.” A kindergarten was opened for young children in the area from 9AM to 12AM, Monday through Friday. Most other clubs met only once or twice a week. By 1903, over 70 girls were attending the sewing class, prompting the beginning of two other classes in sewing and embroidery. As the years passed the membership continued to increase. By 1924, total attendance was 81,375 and by 1933 it was 167,707. However, the interest didn’t stop there; membership peaked at almost 200,000 in 1940. To create interest in the neighborhood, the Kingsley Association at first relied on word of mouth, but to increase their membership even further they soon moved to several media outlets, including radio, newspapers, magazines, and brochures. One such brochure from the early 20th century went: “How would you spend four hours every evening, every week with no money? Read, study, listen to the radio? Well the radio might have one tube or none at all, and there might be so many noisy younger children in the few rooms you called “home” that you couldn’t hear you own thoughts… “What would I do?” Frank [a teenage Kingsley House member] answers the question which a companion had asked of Kingsley House. “You mean if Kingsley House weren’t here to go to? Just what I did – till I got interested in club and basketball – hang around pool-rooms or ‘sneak a movie,’ or worse stuff than that.”” As Pittsburgh modernized so too did the Kingsley Association. The activities offered by the Association were changed to accommodate the times, some of these new programs included Meet-the-Athlete, SAT Prep, Explorers, and Study Skills. Andrew Carnegie Andrew Carnegie also had a vested interest. The Kingsley Association became one of the many charities he contributed to after retiring from the steel business. On the 15th of January, 1913, in a letter to the Kingsley Association, the steel magnate wrote, “Dear Friend, I find I have contributed in the naborhood of $20,000 to Kingsley House and am now paying $3,000 a year. I do not wish to increase this amount of $50,000 I have promist for I feel I have done my part and that liberally…. Please consider this and do not press me further and oblige. Very Truly Yours, Andrew Carnegie.” Locations through history First located on Penn Avenue, in 1901 house operations were transferred to a mansion purchased by industrialist Henry Clay Frick. It was located in the Lower Hill District at Fulton and Bedford Streets. A fresh air farm, known as Lillian Home, was opened in 1903 on land bought by industrialist Charles L. Taylor. The farm remains in operation today. A rapid growth of the African American population in 1919 led to the opening of the Morgan Memorial House in the Hill District. That same year, the University of Pittsburgh conducted a survey of the area surrounding the Kingsley Association and recommended that it relocate its settlement house to East Liberty (Pittsburgh) where it continues to operate today.Home References External sources Finding Aid to the Kingsley Association Records at the Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh Photographs from the Kingsley Association Collection \\\\---- All the information not cited has been obtained with permission from the University of Pittsburgh Archives Service Center located at: 7500 Thomas Boulevard Pittsburgh, PA 15208 Archives Service Center home page Community organizations Organizations based in Pittsburgh Settlement houses ","title":"Kingsley Association (Pittsburgh, PA)"},{"id":"9681215","text":"Camiguin Airport (Cebuano: Tugpahanan sa Camiguin) is an airport serving the general area of Mambajao, located in the province of Camiguin in the Philippines.

It is the most commonly seen species of the genus Xanthorrhoea. Its trunk can grow up to several metres tall and is often branched. In certain Aboriginal languages, it is called bukkup, baggup or kawee. Description The main way to identify Xanthorrhoea is by looking at the cross-section of the leaves. In the case of X. australis the cross-section is a rough diamond shape, and the colour of the leaves is a bluish-green. The species usually develops a rough trunk which may be branched and coloured black, the result of bushfires. The trunk is able to grow up to over in height with a width of up to and may be branched. The bark is thick, rough and corky. The plant is very slow growing and trunks only start appearing after many years. The long, narrow leaves are crowded together at the tops of the trunks. X. australis takes several years to flower, and it does not always flower annually, but in the season after a bushfire it flowers prolifically. The flowers appear on a spear-like spike which can grow up to tall. The flowers, with 6 petals, usually cover – of the stem. The crown of leaves is almost spherical in shape, the point of each leaf perfectly marking the shape of the imagined sphere. The leaves crown the trunk in a crowded whorl of long, wiry leaves. They are arranged in a spiral, forming an erect tuft when young and spreading as they mature, with the oldest leaves dying and forming a hanging skirt around the trunk. The blue-green needle-like leaves are typically long and have a waxy coating. The leaves are softer and generally less rigid than other Xanthorrhoeas. Old leaves hang down forming a distinctive skirt-like feature that partly covers the fire-blackened trunk. X. australis flowers from July to December, but younger plants may flower in June. Grass trees are often very long-lived with some are estimated to be 350 to 450 years old. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Robert Brown in 1810 as part of the work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The genus name Xanthorrhoea is taken from the Greek words xanthos, meaning yellow, and rheo, meaning to flow, a reference to the resin that is obtained from these plants. The species epithet australis, meaning southern, refers to the distribution of the species. Distribution This species can be found in the states of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. It is regarded as the most widely distributed all of the Xanthorroea species. It is able to survive in poor soils, is intolerant to phosphorus and is highly susceptible to the soil- borne disease Phytophthora cinnamomi. Uses Indigenous Australians soaked the flowering spikes in water to produce a sweet drink. The soft, white leaf bases were eaten as well as the growing point of the stem. The flower spike exudes a resin which could be used as an adhesive in the manufacture of tools and the stem used for the lower portion of a spear. Stems were also used to make a base for a fire-drill to start a fire. The resin was also collected and sent to commercial processors where it was made into lacquer for furniture of cabinet makers.

Greenberg received both the Academy Award for Best Film Editing and the BAFTA Award for Best Editing for the film The French Connection (1971). In the 1980s, he edited five films with director Brian De Palma. Greenberg began his career as an assistant to Dede Allen on the film America America (1963), directed by Elia Kazan. Allen has been called \\"the most important film editor in the most explosive era of American film\\". She helped develop the careers of several editors known as \\"Dede's boys\\", and Greenberg was the first.See Greenberg's remarks in Greenberg was Allen's assistant again on Bonnie and Clyde (1967), which was directed by Arthur Penn. The editing of the ambush scene in this film in which Bonnie and Clyde are killed has been very influential, and Allen credited Greenberg with its actual \\"cutting\\". Greenberg was the associate editor for Alice's Restaurant (1969), again directed by Penn and edited by Allen. By that time Greenberg's independent editing career had commenced with Bye Bye Braverman (1968), which was directed by Sidney Lumet. Greenberg later co-edited Penn's The Missouri Breaks (1976) with Allen and Stephen A. Rotter. Early career A native of New York, as a youth, Greenberg learned to edit music and began familiarizing himself with the moviola, splicers, synchronizers and recorders. In 1960, he was offered an apprenticing job for Dede Allen on Elia Kazan’s America America (1963). By 1967, when he and Allen were on Bonnie and Clyde, he was given the task of editing a couple of the shootout scenes, working closely with Allen and director Arthur Penn. He cut his first solo feature, Bye Bye Braverman, for director Sidney Lumet in 1968. Collaboration with William Friedkin Greenberg edited two films with director William Friedkin, The Boys in the Band (1970) and The French Connection (1971). The French Connection was a success at the box-office and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Friedkin attributed much of the film's success to its editing, writing \\"I can't say too much about the importance of editing. When I looked at the first rough cut of the chase, it was terrible. It didn't play. It was formless, in spite of the fact that I had a very careful shooting plan that I followed in detail. It became a matter of removing a shot here or adding a shot there, or changing the sequence of shots, or dropping one frame, or adding one or two frames. And here's where I had enormous help from Jerry Greenberg, the editor. As I look back on it now, the shooting was easy. The cutting and the mixing were enormously difficult. It was all enormously rewarding.\\" The car chase sequence in The French Connection has been called \\"the finest example of montage editing since Battleship Potemkin (1925)\\"; this early film, directed and edited by Sergei Eisenstein, was seminal in the development of film editing. Greenberg won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing and the BAFTA Award for Best Editing for the film. In 2012, The French Connection was selected as the tenth best edited film of all time in a listing compiled by the Motion Picture Editors Guild. Apocalypse Now (1979) Francis Ford Coppola produced, directed, and co- wrote Apocalypse Now, which was released in 1979. Filming had taken over a year in 1976 and 1977. Editing took place over two years prior to its release, and involved several editors; the supervising editor was Richard Marks, another of \\"Dede's boys\\". Greenberg described his own role in an interview with Vincent LoBrutto. The film is now remembered as one of the most important to have emerged from American involvement in the long Vietnam War that had ended in 1975. Writing in 1999, critic Roger Ebert said \\"Apocalypse Now is the best Vietnam film, one of the greatest of all films, because it pushes beyond the others, into the dark places of the soul. It is not about war so much as about how war reveals truths we would be happy never to discover\\". In the 2012 critics' poll conducted by the British Sight & Sound magazine, Apocalypse Now was rated the fourteenth best film ever made. The editing of Apocalypse Now was rated third best of all films in the 2012 listing of the Motion Picture Editors Guild. With Marks, Walter Murch, and Lisa Fruchtman, Greenberg shared in the film's nominations for the Academy Award, the BAFTA Award, and the ACE Eddie. Collaboration with Brian De Palma With the film Dressed to Kill (1980), Greenberg began a 7-year collaboration with director Brian De Palma. Greenberg edited five films with De Palma, with the last being The Untouchables (1987). Greenberg's assistant editor on Dressed to Kill, Bill Pankow, worked on all these films, and was his co-editor for The Untouchables; Pankow subsequently became De Palma's principal editor. The period of De Palma's collaboration with Greenberg has been described as follows: De Palma's \\"early lower-budget thrillers, although superbly manufactured, were too bloody and garish for the average taste and infuriated many critics. But De Palma began gaining respectability with Dressed to Kill (1980) and following several critical setbacks, reached the apex in the late 80s with such high-powered productions as The Untouchables (1987) and Casualties of War (1989). A superb technician, he was finally crafting material worthy of his bold, often dazzling, visual flair.\\" Quoted in Honors & influence Greenberg won the Oscar and the BAFTA awards for The French Connection (1971), and was nominated for the ACE Eddie. With his co-editors, he was nominated again for the Oscar, BAFTA, and Eddie for Apocalypse Now (1979). In the same year, he was nominated for the Oscar and BAFTA for Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), which was the first of his two films with director Robert Benton. Greenberg has been elected to membership in the American Cinema Editors,\\"American Cinema Editors > Members\\", webpage archived by WebCite from this original URL on March 4, 2008. and in 2015 that organization honored him with its Career Achievement Award. Writing after the ceremony at which Greenberg received the Career Achievement Ward, Ross Lincoln and Erik Pedersen said, \\"if editing is the most important part of completing a film, he is one of the most quantifiably influential people in the past 40 years.\\" On the 2012 list of \\"best edited films of all time\\", Greenberg worked on three of the top ten: Bonnie and Clyde, The French Connection, and Apocalypse Now.

Peregrine Books, UK 1964) Franz Kafka's Diaries, written in German language between 1910-1923, include casual observations, details of daily life, reflections on philosophical ideas, accounts of dreams, and ideas for stories. Kafka’s diaries offer a detailed view of the writer's thoughts and feelings, as well as some of his most famous and quotable statements. Kafka began keeping the diaries at the age of 27, as an attempt to provoke his stalled creativity, and kept writing in them until 1923, a year before his death. These diaries were in the background all through the composition of Kafka's major works and many of them are discussed and analyzed in detail. The diaries offer an image of a profoundly depressed man, isolated from friends and family, involved in a series of failed relationships, and constantly sick. While this is certainly part of Kafka's character, it is typical for a private journal, not meant for publication, to express more of the writer's anxieties and worries. The humor and light-heartedness sometimes expressed in Kafka's fiction, as well as the generally positive image arising from recollections by friends and acquaintances, are missing from the diaries. Initially published by Schocken Books in two volumes, The Diaries of Franz Kafka 1910-1913 and The Diaries of Franz Kafka 1914-1923, they were brought together in a single volume in 1964.

The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the season, Florence developed on September 7 from an area of convection associated with a dissipating frontal trough in the southern Gulf of Mexico. After initially moving eastward, the storm turned northward and strengthened. Florence reached hurricane status and later peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on September 9 shortly before striking southeastern Louisiana. The storm rapidly weakened over land and dissipated on September 11 over northeastern Texas. Early in its duration, the storm dropped rainfall across the Yucatán Peninsula. Upon striking Louisiana, Florence produced a moderate storm surge, causing severe beach erosion in some locations. Gusty winds were also reported, causing power outages to over 100,000 people. In Alabama, one man died while trying to secure his boat. Rainfall from the hurricane caused severe river flooding in portions of the Florida Panhandle in an area already severely affected by heavy rainfall; the flooding damaged or destroyed dozens of houses in Santa Rosa County. Throughout its path, damage totaled about $2.9 million (1988 USD, $5.3 million 2008 USD). Meteorological history On September 4, a cold front exited the coast of Texas into the Gulf of Mexico. A convective band from the front continued southeastward and stalled between Veracruz, Mexico and Tampa, Florida. The band began to split into two on September 6; the northeastern portion developed into a frontal wave and tracked northeastward, while the southwestern portion remained nearly stationary and began showing signs of tropical organization. Located in an area of generally low pressures, the system developed a spiral band structure, though deep convection was mostly intermittent. Subsequent to the formation of a surface circulation, the system developed into a tropical depression while located about 450 miles (725 km) northwest of Mérida, Yucatán. Tropical Storm Florence on September 9 The depression drifted eastward under the influence of the dissipating frontal trough, and intensified into Tropical Storm Florence to the north of the Yucatán Peninsula, as confirmed by Hurricane Hunters. Initially, the center was located to the north of the deep convection, with only one weak rainband to the north of the circulation. However, subsequent to a drop in vertical wind shear, an increase in moisture, and increase in upper-level outflow, deep convection greatly increased and organized over the circulation early on September 9. As the trough dissipated and a ridge built northwestward behind it, steering currents became weak, leaving Florence temporarily stationary. Later on September 9, the influence of a mid- to upper-level trough to its north caused Florence to accelerate northward. Steadily intensifying, Florence attained hurricane status about 100 miles (165 km) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. The hurricane intensified slightly further, and struck the western Mississippi River Delta with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) at 0200 UTC on September 10. Upon making landfall, dry air became entrained in the circulation, and Florence rapidly weakened over southeastern Louisiana. By the time it passed over New Orleans and Lake Ponchartrain most convection had dissipated, and about ten hours after making landfall Florence degenerated into a tropical depression. The system subsequently crossed over southwestern Mississippi as it turned northwestward, and later entered northern Louisiana before dissipating over northeastern Texas on September 11. The mid-level circulation turned northeastward through the central United States before dissipating over Ohio on September 13. Preparations On September 9, about 16 hours before Florence made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida. Three hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Pensacola to Cameron, Louisiana, with a tropical storm warning issued from Pensacola eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. Around the time of Florence moving ashore, the National Hurricane Center limited the hurricane warning from Pensacola, Florida to Morgan City, Louisiana. Hours after the hurricane made landfall, the warning was replaced by a tropical storm warning from Mobile, Alabama to Grand Isle, Louisiana, which was discontinued two hours later. Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, an estimated 20,000 people evacuated the coastal parishes of southeastern Louisiana, including nearly all of the 2,000 residents on Grand Isle. Small-scale evacuations were issued for residents living in low-lying or coastal areas of Mississippi and Alabama. Offshore, the threat of the hurricane prompted oil companies to evacuate employees on oil rigs to the mainland. The threat of the hurricane caused Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to cancel a rally and two fund-raising events in New Orleans. Governor Buddy Roemer issued for the Louisiana National Guard to be on standby for emergency duty. Officials closed several bridges across southeastern Louisiana and also canceled ferry travel across Lake Ponchartrain. In Pensacola, Florida, the Navy base moved the USS Lexington into the Gulf of Mexico during the hurricane, and also sent more than 100 aircraft to a base in Ohio. Impact Rainfall Summary for Hurricane Florence The primary rainband extending southward from the circulation of Florence dropped moderate rainfall across the Yucatán Peninsula and through southern Mexico. Rainfall amounts peaked at 10.79 inches (274 mm) in San Baltazar Loxicha, Guerrero, with 10.67 inches (271 mm) reported in southeastern Chiapas and 9.74 inches (247 mm) near Merida. Damage, if any, is unknown. Upon making landfall on Louisiana, Hurricane Florence produced higher than normal tides, including a peak observation of 7.5 feet (2.3 m) above mean sea level on the Bayou Benvenue to the east of New Orleans. Rainfall was relatively light, ranging from about 1 inch (25 mm) to a maximum of 4.05 inches (103 mm) at Watson. Winds of tropical storm force occurred across southeastern Louisiana, with wind gusts peaking at 64 mph (103 km/h) at an automatic Coast Guard Station on the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River Delta. An unofficial tornado was reported in Tangipahoa Parish. Minor storm surge flooding occurred outside of the levee system of southern Louisiana in Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, and Saint Tammany Parishes. On Grand Isle, strong wave action resulted in significant beach erosion, with most areas on the island losing about 40 feet (12.2 m) of beach. The storm surge also flooded a portion of Louisiana Highway 300 near Delacroix. The passage of the hurricane broke a levee in Delacroix; it was quickly repaired with flooding from the levee being pumped to the gulf. Light to moderate damage was reported across the southeastern portion of the state, primarily from falling trees. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving about 150,000 people without power for some period of time during the storm. The power outages were short-lived, with about 6,900 left without power by the day after the hurricane. Damage in the state was fairly minor, totaling about $2.5 million (1988 USD, $4.4 million 2007 USD). Rainfall from Florence reached over 7 inches (178 mm) at one location in southeastern Mississippi, while a station 3 miles (4.8 km) south-southeast of Brewton, Alabama reported a storm-wide peak rainfall total of 10.67 inches (271 mm). Despite the rainfall, no damage was reported in Alabama or Mississippi. In Mobile Bay in Alabama, one man died while attempting to secure his boat — the only direct fatality related to the hurricane. Heavy rainfall was reported along the Florida Panhandle, peaking at over 10 inches (254 mm) in the extreme northwestern portion of the state. The rainfall caused the worst flooding in ten years, and resulted in additional flooding to the already swollen Coldwater Creek and Blackwater River in Santa Rosa County. Near the river, 30 homes were destroyed with an additional 50 houses damaged, totaling about $320,000 (1988 USD, $560,000 2007 USD) in damage. Several roads were closed from the flooding, as well. The strong convective band associated with Florence extended across the Florida Panhandle, spawning nine tornadoes in Walton County and one waterspout in Bay County. Damage from the tornadoes amounted to about $100,000 (1988 USD, $175,000 2007 USD). The remnant circulation of Florence produced light to moderate rainfall across the Ohio Valley and central United States. Precipitation reached over 3 inches (75 mm) in extreme southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois, and central Ohio, and extended as far northward as Michigan.

In his last year on air, he was forced to share a program with Mike Schopp, who had previously been Dickerson's nemesis at crosstown rival WNSA. It was speculated in the press that WGR released Dickerson from the station because it wanted to gain the rights to Sabres hockey broadcasts, which it purchased in 2004 along with radio station WNSA.Fybush, Scott.

Early decathlon tables  All of the earliest attempts at formalizing decathlon scoring, from the first formal submission (prepared by the U.S. in 1884) until 1915, involved linear scoring equations. The American model was based on world records, but models concurrently used by several Nordic countries were based on their respective national records. The decathlon was first included in the Olympic Games in 1912, requiring a uniform standard. The first Olympic tables adopted were also linear functions; they were based not on world or national records, but, rather, on the 1908 Olympic records for each of the individual events. The tables were soon updated with the 1912 Olympic records – and the universally disliked extension of event scores to three decimal places was discarded in favor of integer scores – and the tables were used thus in the next four Olympiads. The rapid evolution of the scoring tables caused results to vary widely. For instance, Akilles Järvinen, the silver medalist in the decathlon in both the 1928 and 1932 Olympics, would have won gold in both years rather handily under most later years' scoring tables.  Tests for legitimacy  Beginning in 1920, the IAAF considered, at least, the following criteria for a legitimate decathlon scoring table: (1) The table should reflect the fact that, at higher levels of performance, a unit gain (such as a decrement of 0.01 second in sprint times) is more significant than at lower levels of performance, because of the physiological limitations of the human body. (2) The scores for different events should be comparable, in a manner such that equal skill levels in different events (however difficult it is to define such a concept) are rewarded with equal point levels.  1934 scoring tables  In 1934, the IAAF adopted a new set of scoring tables, proposed by Suomen Urheiluliitto (the Finnish athletics federation), that had already been used for a few years in national competitions in Finland. This scoring system implemented vast changes, with the following features: (1) All of the individual events were scored with exponential functions, rather than the linear functions that had characterized all decathlon scoring tables to date. For field events, this was a straightforward statistical procedure; for track events, the reciprocal of the athlete's time, representing speed, was used as the independent variable. (2) The tables ranged from 0 to 1150 points per event. Zero points corresponded to the performances of untrained schoolchildren, and 1000-point performances corresponded closely to world records.  1950 scoring tables  After World War II, the Finnish and Swedish athletics federations joined forces to draft scoring tables appropriate for Olympic athletes' improved postwar performances. All of the tables remained progressive in nature; in fact, the progressive character of every one of the ten tables increased.  1962 scoring tables  In the years following the implementation of the 1950 tables, controversy arose, in regard to the highly progressive character of the tables. Specifically, the tables conferred a distinct advantage on decathletes who were specialists in individual events, with passing, but not stellar, performances in the other events, while putting well-rounded athletes at a relative disadvantage. To remedy this problem, Axel Jörbeck, of the Swedish athletic federation, devised new tables that were actually regressive in throwing events, while retaining their progressive character in track events. The rationale behind the changes was the proportion between kinetic energy imparted to a throwing implement and the square of its initial velocity – and therefore distance travelled – so that a progressive or even linear table caused unfairly large increments in the score for throwing events.  1984 scoring tables  By the early 1980s, more problems had been pointed out with the then-current scoring tables. Specifically, the regressive nature of Jörbeck's tables for the field events seemed to obviate the importance of elite performances in those events; decathletes' field-event performances had improved to the point where further score increments were practically negligible. Moreover, besides sapping decathletes' motivation to improve in field events, the tables also gave an unfair advantage to competitors in the track events – both because those tables were still progressive and because decathletes' performances in those events were much closer to the world records. The IAAF working committee therefore met in 1983 in Prague to develop improved tables, putting forth the following nine principles, which still stand today: # The decathlon scoring tables should differ from those used for individual event scoring. # The scores for different events should be comparable, in a manner such that equal skill levels in different events (however difficult it is to define such a concept) are rewarded with equal point levels. # The new tables should be one of the following: ## modified versions of the existing ones, ## linear in all events, or ## slightly progressive in all events. # The tables should be applicable to all levels of performance, from youth to elite. # Men and women should have different tables. # Specialists' performances should be the basis for the scores in the tables. # The new tables should be applicable now and in the future. # The total scores using the new tables for the top world-class athletes should remain approximately the same (about 8500 points). # As much as possible, the new tables should ensure that a specialist in one event cannot overcome top performances in the other events. The 1984 tables are still in use today, with a slight update in 1998 (adding entries for the long throws for odd numbers of centimeters, which were rounded to the next-lower multiples of 2 cm until 1997).

Möllendorff is mostly known for his service as an adviser to the Korean king Gojong in the late nineteenth century and for his contributions to Sinology. Möllendorff is also known for having created a system for romanizing the Manchu language. Early life Hailing from the Prussian aristocratic family von Möllendorf, Paul Georg von Möllendorff was the son of Georg von Möllendorff, a high-ranking Prussian civil servant. The young Möllendorff attended gymnasium in Görlitz and he enrolled at University of Halle in 1865, where he studied law, oriental studies and philology. Möllendorff showed a strong aptitude for the study of classical and foreign languages and acquired a good command of Hebrew, but did not study any East Asian languages at the time. China In 1869, Möllendorff interrupted his studies and went to China in order to join the Imperial Maritime Customs Service in Shanghai. While working for the Customs in Shanghai and later Hankou, Möllendorff acquired a good command of Chinese and quickly passed the required language exam. However, he soon grew dissatisfied with his tasks in the service and left it in 1874 in order to join the German consular service as an interpreter and was eventually promoted German vice-consul in Tianjin. During his service in Tianjin, Möllendorff befriended Ma Jianzhong, who worked in the secretariat of the prominent Qing statesman, governor-general Li Hongzhang. In 1879, Möllendorff assisted Li in procuring weapons and warships from the German companies Vulkan and Krupp. In 1881, Möllendorff left the German consular service because of his complicated relationship to the German minister in Beijing, Max von Brandt. Korea In 1882, Li Hongzhang recommended Möllendorff to the position of the adviser to the Korean government and in December 1882, he arrived in Seoul for his first audience with King Gojong. Möllendorff quickly learned enough Korean to be able to communicate with the king and soon earned the trust of the king, who appointed him deputy foreign minister and charged him with the establishment of the Korean Customs Service. Möllendorff adopted the Sino-Korean name Mok In-dok ( Mok Indeok, Mù Líndé in Mandarin) and soon became a very influential figure in the Korean government. Möllendorff wanted to assert the independence of Korea and contrary to the wishes of Li Hongzhang and Robert Hart, he wanted to make the Korean Customs Service as independent from the Chinese Maritime Customs Service as possible. Möllendorff also advocated that Korea enter into an alliance with the Russian Empire to counterbalance Chinese and Japanese influences on the Korean peninsula. In response to this, the British occupied the Korean island of Geomun by force, calling it Port Hamilton. Consequently, the Qing government felt that Möllendorff acted too independently and in 1885 Li Hongzhang forced Möllendorff's resignation from the Korean government. In 1888, King Gojong unsuccessfully tried to reinstate Möllendorff. Scholarly work and later life Having left his position in Korean government, Möllendorff returned to work in the Imperial Maritime Customs and became Commissioner of Customs in the southern treaty port of Ningbo, where he would spend the last days of his life. In Ningbo, he worked to improve the customs service and also wrote a number of works on Sinology. Between 1896 and 1897 he was the president of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.

It is the fifth novel set in the Revelation Space universe, and takes place prior to the four previously released Revelation Space novels, but after some of the short stories. A sequel, Elysium Fire, was released in January 2018. While the novel takes place in the Revelation Space universe, it has little connection to the other novels.  Setting  =The Glitter Band= The Prefect is set in the 25th century in the Glitter Band, the realm of thousands of orbital habitats surrounding the planet Yellowstone in the Epsilon Eridani system, and the height of human civilization at the time. Events take place prior to the advent of the Melding Plague that had already ruined the Glitter Band and caused a massive decline in Yellowstone civilization at the time of the other Revelation Space novels. Tom Dreyfus is the titular prefect, a member of a special investigations police force called Panoply that is responsible for protecting the Glitter Band. The novel offers a thoroughly in-depth study of future technology, including augmented reality within the Revelation Space universe, due its unique setting in the time-line. Set a century before the devastating effects of the melding plague, the book is able to showcase the golden age of mankind alluded to in earlier books. The Glitter Band is a group of ten-thousand orbital habitats orbiting Yellowstone with a population of 100-million humans. All habitats in the glitter band represent a different format of society, all linked by the common right to vote. A giant computer network runs thousands of polls everyday to decide the general actions of the Glitter Band as a whole. Most inhabitants have built in computer routines in their brains that make these decisions for them, making a conscious effort on only the most important polls. Every habitat has a polling core, a giant computer that generates the polls and transmits the inhabitants’ votes. Each habitat votes on its own laws and punishments, the only universal crime being withholding someone’s right to vote, fraudulent voting, or restricting someone's access to abstraction (a form of digital communication and virtual reality used throughout the Glitter Band). The right to vote and access abstraction for each inhabitant is policed by the Glitter Bands’ security force, Panoply. Chasm City is policed independently, and most habitats have their own internal constabulary forces to police other crimes. =Panoply= Panoply is the police force for the Glitter Band. It exists in its own dedicated habitat, governed by a lightly armed force of Prefects. The prefect hierarchy is the following: *Cadet: Prefect in training. *Prefect: Freshly graduated Prefect, but not yet qualified for assignments outside of Panoply *Field Prefect: Prefects experienced enough to police the Glitter Band. *Senior Prefect: Field Prefects that have shown themselves experienced enough to serve the administration of Panoply. Usually working from an office, they still retain field status. *Supreme Prefect: The chief of the entire organisation. At the start of the novel, this position is held by Jane Aumonier. Panoply does not have the right to carry armed weaponry as standard, with the exception of whip-hounds, electronic whips that are used primarily in defence. If Panoply feels the need to use heavier weaponry, this must be voted on by the entire Glitter Band in an emergency poll before any action can be undertaken (although Panoply command ignores this limitation in the novel, and uses heavy weapons in spite of a vote against it). In this regard, Panoply can only exist if the populace is happy for them to proceed, which defuses much potential tension in this particular society. One issue the Prefects have to grapple with is that they can only enforce the right to vote and access to abstraction; they are not permitted to stop any other human rights violations. This eventually drives Prefect Gaffney to assist Aurora, the antagonist, in her takeover bid. Plot summary The novel begins with Dreyfus being sent out on a routine assignment to lock down a glitter-band habitat for polling violations. His superiors send one of his deputies, Thalia Ng, to distribute software upgrades around the Glitter Band to prevent anyone from attempting a similar violation. In the meantime, Dreyfus is sent to investigate the recent destruction of a habitat named Ruskin-Sartorious. Analysis indicates that the habitat has been destroyed by the flame of a Conjoiner Drive, and Dreyfus's team believe the lighthugger Accompaniment of Shadows, the only one to have been near the habitat in recent weeks, is responsible. Before they can conclude their investigation, however, the Ultranauts take justice into their own hands and destroy the ship, but not before Dreyfus is able to converse with the captain, who convinces him that his crew were not responsible. Believing him to be truthful, Dreyfus and his deputy, the hyperpig Sparver, decide to investigate the matter further. Dreyfus and Sparver interview digital backups of the inhabitants of Ruskin-Sartorious. Dreyfus speaks with one of them about the Clockmaker, an alien machine which formerly lived in a Glitter Band research centre, creating, as its name suggests, clocks, before it began a violent killing spree and was destroyed with nuclear weapons nine years prior to the novel. He and Sparver then analyse communication records from the Ruskin- Sartorious habitat, and discover links with an orbiting asteroid owned by the Nerval-Lermontov family (a member of which was called Aurora). They defeat its defence systems and penetrate inside, discovering a Conjoiner starship trapped inside. One of them, Clepsydra, has escaped and is hiding. She meets with Dreyfus and tells him that she and the other Conjoiners had been enslaved by Aurora (now an extremely powerful software entity) to use the Exordium to predict the future. The Conjoiners predict a future devastated by what is implied to be the Melding Plague, and Aurora has been planning to respond to stop it (use of the Exordium creates a new timeline which can be changed to avoid the future the Exordium describes). She and Dreyfus escape as a ship under Aurora's control arrives and destroys the habitat. At the same time, Thalia has distributed the software upgrade to the required four habitats across the Glitter Band, but it appears to be malfunctioning; information access is shut down in the habitats she has visited, and servitors (service robots used across the Glitter Band) are rounding up and exterminating civilians. She and some of the survivors of the last habitat take refuge in its polling core tower, barricading the entrance. Outside, the servitors begin to construct \\"weevil\\" war machines using plans stolen by Gaffney, a Senior Prefect secretly in alliance with Aurora. Back at Panoply, with Dreyfus in the field and out of communication, Gaffney manipulates the Senior Prefects into voting Aumonier out of office. Clepsydra is taken into isolation, whilst Dreyfus explains the situation to the Senior Prefects. Unbeknownst to him, however, Gaffney kills Clepsydra and frames Dreyfus. The Prefects debate what to do about the emergence of the weevils, which have now left the four original habitats and are moving towards others. Before very long, however, Gaffney is exposed as the murderer of Clepsydra when attempting to interrogate Dreyfus. He admits to his role in the weevil outbreak and informs the Prefects that Aurora is responsible. Aurora herself contacts Panoply and demands that they stand down, claiming to be taking over the Glitter Band for its own good. Aumonier, now back in power, refuses and orders Panoply to ready for war. Although Thalia escapes from Aurora's forces during a disastrous attack by Panoply, simulations run by the Prefects indicate that they have virtually no chance of success; the weevils are destroying habitats and converting them into even more weevils, grossly outnumbering the Prefects. Aumonier speaks to Dreyfus and tells him that the aforementioned Clockmaker was not actually destroyed nine years previously; part of it survived and was recovered by Panoply. The ultra-secret Panoply unit, Firebrand, was established to research it. Although Aumonier ordered it shut down, she now believes its members relocated the Clockmaker to Ruskin-Sartorious. As the Clockmaker was the only intelligence in the Glitter Band capable of defeating Aurora, she attempted to destroy it. Dreyfus confronts members of Firebrand, who confirm Aumonier's theory, but reveal that the Clockmaker was not in fact destroyed; Firebrand became aware of the attack in advance and moved the Clockmaker. Following them to the surface of Yellowstone, he and Sparver fight their way into an abandoned Amerikano colony, where the Clockmaker is being hidden. Sparver leaves to fight Gaffney, who is approaching the colony with bombs to destroy the Clockmaker. Dreyfus meets with the Clockmaker, who reveals that he is actually Philip Lascaille, a character in Revelation Space who was believed to have committed suicide after meeting with the Shrouders, but was in fact scanned to produce a simulation, which was sent back to the Shrouders, who turned it into the Clockmaker. Dreyfus tells the Clockmaker what is happening. It incapacitates him and leaves. Regaining consciousness, Dreyfus meets with Sparver. They return to Panoply to find that the weevil attack has collapsed; the Clockmaker has uploaded itself into the Glitter Band's data network and is fighting a digital war with Aurora. As such, she is unable to control the weevils effectively, and the Prefects are destroying them in alliance with the Ultras. Dreyfus begins preparing to investigate the death of Philip Lascaille, having promised the Clockmaker he would bring those responsible to justice.  Sequel and new title  On 25 July 2017 Alastair Reynolds announced on his blog that his next book Elysium Fire would be a direct sequel to The Prefect which itself would be given the new title Aurora Rising, to better fit with the Panoply stories being a series in their own right within the Revelation Space universe.

He studied medicine at the University of Paris, earning his degree in 1843. Later he became a professor of anatomy in Paris, and in 1862 was elected to the Académie Nationale de Médecine, becoming its president in 1887. In 1868 he succeeded Jean-François Jarjavay (1815–1868) as chair of anatomy, a position he held until 1886. Sappey was a highly regarded anatomist remembered for his research of the lymphatic system. In 1874 he published an anatomical atlas that included a detailed study of cutaneous lymphatic drainage. He was married to Antoinette Clotilde Dumas who was a scientific illustrator. She illustrated some of his publications. He devised a procedure to define and delineate the lymphatic system by injecting mercury into the skin of a cadaver in order to properly view the individual lymphatic vessels. Anatomist Henri Rouvière (1876-1952) continued Sappey's anatomical work of the human lymphatic system.

It is the only airport in the province of Sulu. The airport is classified as a Class 2 principal (minor domestic) airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, a body of the Department of Transportation that is responsible for the operations of not only this airport but also of all other airports in the Philippines except the major international airports. History Jolo Airport was constructed in the 1940s during World War II as a staging point for American fighter aircraft. At the time, it had a 1,000-meter runway.P232M earmarked for Jolo airport , Philippine Daily Inquirer, October 15, 2008 At the end of the war, the airport, then owned by the United States military, was turned over to the Sulu provincial government. The airport was expanded in 1965 by President Ferdinand Marcos, who expanded the runway to 1,200 meters. Marcos would later expand the runway by some 500 meters, though the runway would shrink again to its 1965 size. A three million-dollar expansion project, financed by the United States, seeks to rehabilitate the old airport by expanding the current runway to over 2,000 meters, enabling aircraft as large as the Boeing 737 to land at the airport.Rehab of Sulu airport to start soon, GMA News and Public Affairs, April 27, 2007 The rehabilitated airport should enable larger passenger planes to arrive at the new airport, facilitating trade and enabling flights not only to Manila but also to neighboring Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Currently, the largest plane landing in Jolo is the C-130 Hercules.Jolo airport up for rehabilitation , Sun.Star Zamboanga, April 29, 2008 In August 2008, a Manila-based construction company, CS Santiago Construction, won the bidding for the airport's expansion. Some P80 million has been allocated by the Philippine government for the construction of a terminal building, perimeter fencing and relocation of affected military camps and residents. The runway will be expanded to a length of 1,800 meters and a width of 60 meters, long and wide enough for larger planes to land. Construction is set to begin in October and should be completed by late 2009.Jolo Airport’s Construction In Full Steam, Provincial Government of Sulu, September 29, 2008 On December 14, 2009, then former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and ex-US Ambassador to the Philippines Kristie A.

It was presumably first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and reported in his book PiHKAL.PiHKAL #46 2C-T-13 Chemistry 2C-T-13 is the 2 carbon homologue of Aleph-13. The full chemical name is 2-[4-(2-methoxyethylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethanamine. The drug has structural properties similar to mescaline and other drugs in the 2C-T series, with the most closely related compounds being 2C-T-7 and 2C-T-21. General information The dosage range of 2C-T-13 is typically 25 - 40 mg and its duration is approximately 6–8 hours according to Shulgin. 2C-T-13 produces many closed-eye visuals and geometric patterns. It also produces slight visual distortion. Pharmacology The mechanism that produces 2C-T-13's hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been specifically established; however, it is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known. Dangers The toxicity of 2C-T-13 is not well documented. 2C-T-13 is slightly less potent than 2C-T-7, but it may be expected that at higher doses it would display similar toxicity to that of other phenethylamines of the 2C-T family. Legality 2C-T-13 is not scheduled in the United States, but possession and sales of 2C-T-13 could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to 2C-T-7. As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-13 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

He also served King James I of Scotland as a diplomat in England, France, and Italy. Early church career Lichton was born in the diocese of Brechin (probably Angus) somewhere between 1369 and 1379 to Henry and Janet Lichton.Ditchburn, \\"Lichton , Henry (1369x79–1440)\\". He was well-educated for his time, attending the University of Orléans and possibly the University of St Andrews, earning licentiates in civil law and canon law, a bachelorate in canon law, and a doctorate in canon law, all achieved between 1394 and 1415; he attained an additional doctorate--in civil law--by 1436. Lichton followed an ecclesiastical career simultaneously with his studies. The first notice of this career comes in 1392, when he was vicar of Markinch in Fife, a vicariate of St Andrews Cathedral Priory.Cowan, Parishes, p. 143. He was a canon of the diocese of Moray by 1394,Ditchburn, \\"Lichton, Henry (1369x79–1440)\\"; he latter is known to have held Inverkeithny, Strathbogie, a prebend of Moray since the episcopate of Bishop Andrew back in the 1220s; see Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 120, and Cowan, Parishes, p. 89. and Archdeacon of Aberdeen by 1395, holding this position into the following year, 1396.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 19. Bishop of Moray After the death of Bishop John de Innes in 1414, the chapter of Elgin Cathedral met to elect a new bishop, and on 18 May Lichton was elected Bishop of Moray.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 215; there is record of the election, though no record of the result; the result is guessed at by Lichton's unopposed accession to the bishopric; see Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 158. Lichton travelled to Continental Europe to receive consecration, and was consecrated on 8 March 1415, at Valencia by Pope Benedict XIII.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 157; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 215. Lichton enjoyed an amicable relationship with the most powerful magnate in the area, Alexander Stewart, Lord of Badenoch and Earl of Mar, as Lichton appears to have suffered no harassment, attended the latter's marriage to Isabella, Countess of Mar back in 1404 and procured for him an annulment of that marriage when Stewart chose to remarry in 1415. Lichton was probably a kinsman of Stewart, as he is described as a kinsman of Stewart's uncle, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, the man who ruled Scotland as governor until his death in 1420.Ditchburn, \\"Lichton, Henry (1369x79–1440)\\"; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 120. Bishop of Aberdeen St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen; the west front dates from Lichton's episcopate. After the death of Gilbert de Greenlaw, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1421, Lichton was chosen as his successor, and was translated to the diocese of Aberdeen in early April 1422, on the authority of Pope Martin V.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 120; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 3. Pope Martin delegated authority to Robert de Cardeny, Bishop of Dunkeld, and William Stephen, Bishop of Dunblane, in order to take Lichton's oath to the Papal see without forcing him to travel to Rome. It is of note that Lichton had already been in possession of the prebend of Kinkell in the Aberdeen diocese,Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 120. a former possession of the Knights Hospitaller but attached to Aberdeen Cathedral by Lichton's time.Cowan, Parishes, p. 113; Innes, Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, p. xxxvii, says he was chanter or precentor by this prebend, but Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 9-12, fails to list him among their number, and gives the church of Auchterless as the chanter's prebend. As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton was one of its greatest builders. The Aberdeen Registrum noted that he began to rebuild the cathedral,Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 120, citing Innes, Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, vol. ii, p. 120. and Hector Boece gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 121. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much of his own money to new service books and vestments, as well as to the reconstruction of the cathedral. He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived. Diplomatic career James I, King of Scots. Henry was frequently used as an ambassador by the king, James I of Scotland. According to the 16th century Bishop of Ross and historian John Lesley, Henry was one of the men sent to England to arrange the ransom of King James - held in England for most of his youth, not being released until 1424.Innes, Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, vol. i, p. xxxvii; for details of James' reign and time as a hostage, see Michael Brown's study, James I, (East Linton, 1994). On 9 June 1425, he and other prelates received a safe-conduct from King Henry VI of England enabling them to travel through England on their way to visit Pope Martin V at Rome. In 1428, Henry was the leader of an embassy sent to King Charles VII of France for a marriage proposal and to renew the Franco-Scottish alliance,Ditchburn, \\"Lichton, Henry (1369x79–1440)\\"; Innes, Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, vol. i, p. xxxvii. and in January 1430, was sent into England for discussion of various grievances.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 120-1. On 31 March 1434, Lichton is found in attendance at the Council of Basel, though no more details of his activities there have survived. Death Bishop Leighton's grave, St Machar's Cathedral Effigy of Bishop Henry Lichtoun, St Machar's Cathedral Lichton's death cannot be precisely dated. It fell between 11 November (Martinmas) 1440, and 11 January 1441;Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 3. it is probable that he died on either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given to him in the 15th century and the 16th century respectively. He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist. As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father a bastard, a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving papal dispensation to marry in 1432. Due to curtailment of the cathedral the grave now lies in what appears as a simple enclosure on the east end of the cathedral i.e. it is no longer internal. Due to its exposure the grave is now somewhat ruinous. The stone effigy of the bishop has been moved and low lies on display in the north-west corner of the cathedral.

Her family belonged to the higher bourgeois society in Paris. Her father, Nicholas Avrillot, was Accountant General in the Chamber of Paris, and chancellor of Marguerite of Navarre, first wife of Henry IV of France; while her mother, Marie Lhuillier was a descendant of Etienne Marcel, the famous prévôt des marchands (chief municipal magistrate). She was placed with the Poor Clares of the Abbey of Longchamp, where she had a maternal aunt, for her education, and acquired there a vocation for the cloister. In 1584, through obedience she married Pierre Acarie, viscount of Villemor, a wealthy young man of high standing, who was a fervent Catholic, to whom she bore seven children. Pierre Acarie disapproved of Barbe's reading romance novels and with clerical advice removed the books and substituted books of a more pious and spiritual bent. Pierre Acarie was one of the staunchest members of the Catholic League, which, after the death of Henry III of France, opposed the succession of the Huguenot prince, Henry of Navarre, to the French throne. He was one of the sixteen who organized the resistance in Paris and partly responsible for the subsequent famine which resulted from the siege of Paris (1590).\\" Bl Mary of the Incarnation\\", Discalced Carmelite Friars, Anglo-Irish and Scottish Region Mary was so wise in her almsgiving that during a famine the wealthy persons who desired to help the poor caused their alms to pass through her hands, and she was widely respected. After the dissolution of the League, brought about by the abjuration of Henry IV, Acarie was exiled from Paris and his wife had to remain behind to contend with creditors and businessmen for her children's fortune, which had been compromised by her husband's want of foresight and prudence. She defended her husband in court, drafting memoirs, writing letters and furnishing proofs of his innocence. He was acquitted and enabled to return to the city after three years. Guerin, Msgr. Paul. Les Petits Bollandistes: Vies des Saints, (Bloud et Barral: Paris, 1882), Vol. 4 In addition she was afflicted with physical sufferings, the consequences of a fall from her horse, and a very severe course of treatment left her an invalid for the rest of her life. At the beginning of the 17th century, Acarie was widely known for her virtue, her supernatural gifts, and especially her charity towards the poor and the sick in the hospitals. To her residence came all the distinguished and devout people of the day in Paris, among them Madame de Meignelay, née de Gondi, a model of Christian widows, Madame Jourdain and Madame de Bréauté, all future Carmelites, the Chancellor de Merillac, Père Coton, the Jesuit, as well as Vincent de Paul and Francis de Sales, who for six months was Acarie's spiritual director. She is reputed to have had the gift of healing, the gift of prophecy, of predicting certain events in the future, of reading hearts and of discerning spirits. At the age of twenty-seven, she received the stigmata, the grace of physical conformity to the Suffering Christ. She is the first Frenchwoman the authenticity of whose stigmata (although invisible) have been attested by eminent persons. In 1601 she was introduced to the Life of St Teresa of Avila and was greatly moved by her life. A few days later Teresa, appeared to her and informed her that God wished to make use of her to found Carmelite convents in France. The apparitions continuing, Acarie took counsel and began the work. A meeting in which Pierre de Bérulle, future founder of the Oratory of Jesus, Francis de Sales, the Abbé de Brétigny, and the Marillac's took part, decided on the foundation of the \\"Reformed Carmel in France\\", 27 July 1602. St Frances the Sales was the one who wrote to the pope to obtain authorization and Pope Clement VIII granted the Bull of institution on 23 November 1603. The following year some Spanish Carmelites were received into the Carmel of Rue St. Jacques, which became celebrated. Mme de Longueville, Anne de Gonzague, Mlle de la Vallieres, withdrew to it; there also Bossuet and Fénelon were to preach. The Carmel spread rapidly and profoundly influenced French society of the day. Barbara Acarie also cooperated in the new foundations of Pontoise (1605), Dijon (1605) and Amiens (1606). In 1618, the year of Mme Acarie's death, it numbered fourteen houses. Mme Acarie also shared in two foundations of the day, that of the Oratory and that of the Ursulines.Fournet, Pierre Auguste. \\"Bl. Marie de l'Incarnation.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 Jun. 2013 On 11 November 1611 she, with Vincent de Paul, assisted at the Mass of the installation of the Oratory of France. Among the many postulants whom Mme Acarie received for the Carmel, there were some who had no vocation, and she conceived the idea of getting them to undertake the education of young girls, and broached her plan to her holy cousin, Mme. de Sainte-Beuve. To establish the new Order, they brought Ursulines to Paris and adopted their rule and name. Statue et reliquaire Barbe Acarie When her husband died in 1613, his widow settled her affairs and begged leave to enter the Carmel, asking as a favour to be received as a lay sister in the poorest community. In 1614 she withdrew to the monastery of Amiens, taking the name of Marie of the Incarnation.\\"Blessed Mary of the Incarnation OCD\\", Order of the Brothers of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel Her three daughters had preceded her into the cloister, and one of them, Margaret of the Blessed Sacrament, was sub-prioress at Amiens. She made her solemn profession on April 8, 1615, in the course of a prolonged sickness. In 1616, for reasons of health, she was sent to the Carmelite convent at Pontoise, where she died at the age of fifty-two. Veneration She was beatified by Pope Pius VI in 1791; her mortal remains are in the chapel of the Carmelites of Pontoise.\\"Pontoise\\", Le Carmel en Francehttp://www.patrimoine- histoire.fr/Patrimoine/Pontoise/Pontoise-Carmel.htm Her feast is celebrated on 18 April. Legacy She is primarily noted for the introduction of the reform of Teresa of Jesus into France, so much so that she merits the title of \\"mother and foundress of the (Discalced) Carmel in France\\". Evelyn Underhill regarded, the vigorous and saintly Madame Acarie, as providing the first definite impulsion towards that interior growth which made, the exquisite and urbane Francis de Sales, a fit guide for the soul of Jane Frances de Chantal.Mystics of the Church, Evelyn Underhill, P.192, Pub 1975 by James Clarke and co Ltd.

Built in 1894, the cannery echoes the days when it was the leading producer of canned salmon in British Columbia. Today it is a museum with interactive exhibits, film, and tours that demonstrate the Cannery's important role in the history of Canada's West Coast fishing industry. The Gulf of Georgia Cannery Society, a non-profit community organization, operates the site on behalf of Parks Canada. History =Early years= The cannery opened in 1894, in the boomtown of Steveston on the lower Fraser River. It was the largest cannery in British Columbia until 1902. It was known as the \\"Monster Cannery\\" - packing more than 2.5 million cans of salmon in 1897. Each canning season attracted a workforce of hundreds of workers, usually of First Nations, Chinese, Japanese, and European descent. At the time, fish canning was one of British Columbia's largest employers, and produced one of its principal export commodities. =Advancing technology= Over the years, the hordes of people manually canning salmon gave way to rows of high-speed machinery. For the Gulf of Georgia Cannery, the price to pay for these advancements would be a diminished role in the canning of salmon, as the last can of sockeye rolled off the production line in 1930. Then, the British Columbia Fishing and Packing Company and Gosse Packing Company Limited merged, forming British Columbia Packers Limited, an amalgamation of the other canneries in the community. =World War 2= The Gulf of Georgia Cannery remained quiet during the 1930s, but with the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, the Cannery was revitalized by an onslaught of new capital and expansion in anticipation of a new enterprise, namely herring. New machinery and an army of workers produced case after case of canned herring in tomato sauce, the major source of protein for Allied soldiers and civilians struggling overseas during the war. Herring canning became an industry-wide endeavour and alongside it grew the business of herring reduction, that is, the transformation of herring into protein-rich oil and meal for animal feeding purposes. =Post war= The end of the war meant the end of a market and the end of herring canning in British Columbia. For the Gulf of Georgia Cannery, herring reduction would become the predominant activity by the late 1940s. The rise of this industry is reflected by the growth of the Cannery complex which saw three successive waves of expansion before the herring reduction industry was crippled by overfishing and government closure in the late 1960s. By the 1970s, a new market emerged in Japan for British Columbia herring roe and this ensured that the reduction operation at the Cannery would run once more. However, the new roe industry generated only a small amount of raw material for reduction, as catches formerly in the hundreds of thousands of tonnes were limited by regulation to the low tens of thousands. =Closure= By 1979, the cost of operating the Cannery's aging reduction equipment became too much and the reduction plant was closed. The buildings would serve as a net loft and storage for the Canadian Fishing Company's boat fleet and the era of transforming the Cannery into a museum would begin in earnest. =National Historic Site= During the 1970s and early 1980s the local community lobbied various levels of government to save the Cannery. In 1979 the Federal government purchased the property and in 1984 it was transferred to Parks Canada. The building was first open to the public in 1994 in celebration of the centennial of the building. The Gulf of Georgia Cannery Society, a local not-for-profit organization, was formed in 1986 to work together with Parks Canada to develop and operate the site. Today, the Cannery is one of the very few federally owned National Historic Sites operated by a third party. Chronology The Cannery, seen from the Fisherman's Park (2007) Fisherman's Park sculpture in 2018 1894 - Construction of the original L-shaped building; one manual canning line. 1897 - East Wing built to provide additional packing and seasonal living area.

It's a heated high school rivalry, and officials soon realized who was responsible. For the past 20 years the swords have stood at the entrance of Brazoswood High School. They are a symbol of pride for the Buccaneers. That pride was damaged as students arrived at school finding the swords missing. The display where they once stood was wrapped in purple tape. Purple is Angleton's color. A series of text messages helped Clute police track the three 17-year-olds down. They found the swords at one of their homes. The swords were taken back to the school and welded back in their rightful place, and they continue to stand at the entrance to Brazoswood High School to this day. https://www.dps.texas.gov/crimereports/15/citCh7.pdf  Notable alumni  =Sports= * Andrea Carter - Midwestern State NCAA Division II All America forward * Quandre Diggs - football player, defensive back for Seattle Seahawks * Mark Farris - former Texas A&M; University quarterback and former shortstop in Pittsburgh Pirates minor league system * Terrence Franks - football player, running back at Texas State University–San Marcos * Gilbert Gardner - pro football linebacker, Super Bowl champion * Ahmard Hall - starter for BCS Champions 2005 Texas Longhorns football team and current Tennessee Titans Fullback * Ryan Jackson - running back at University of Houston * Quentin Jammer - football player, The University of Texas, played 11 seasons as San Diego Chargers defensive back and his last season in 2013 for Denver Broncos. * Henry Josey - CFL running back for Toronto Argonauts * DJ Monroe - running back at University of Texas * Tom Muecke - football player * Ben Skrla - Texas A&M; University discus thrower * Larry Stephens - NFL defensive end * Rodney Terry - basketball head coach, Fresno State * Emmitt Thomas - football player, Marshall High, NFL Hall of Fame with Kansas City Chiefs * Keith Toston - CFL Calgary Stampeders running back * Carter Wallace - swimmer at University of Missouri * Ray Willis - professional football player =Others= *Drew B.

Description Basi is the local beverage of Ilocos in northern Luzon in San Ildefonso where it has been consumed since before the Spanish conquest. In the Philippines, commercial basi is produced by first crushing sugarcane and extracting the juice. The juice is boiled in vats and then stored in earthen jars (tapayan). Once the juice has cooled, flavorings made of ground glutinous rice and duhat (java plum) bark or other fruits or barks is added. The jars are then sealed with banana leaves and allowed to ferment for several years. The resulting drink is pale red in color. If fermented longer, it turns into suka or vinegar. Basi Revolt The 1807 Basi Revolt in Piddig, Ilocos Norte, occurred when the Philippines' Spanish rulers effectively banned private manufacture of the beverage. A Basi festival is held annually in Naguilian, La Union. Recently, the Sangguniang Bayan of San Ildefonso approved a resolution declaring September 16 as a non-working holiday and named the old road in Gongogong as Ambaristo street in honor Pedro Ambaristo, leader of the Basi Revolt. Mayor Christian Purisima enrolled basi as their entry into the “One Town; One Product” (OTOP) program of Savellano. Commercial production Basi del Diablo Wines of the Salucop Group, Inc. started making basi in the year 1906, 99 years after the Basi Revolt. The light fermented sugarcane winemaker's most prominent product is the Ambaristo, named after the Basi Revolt hero Pedro Ambaristo.

Dog walking and frisbee playing is popular in the park (there is a full frisbee golf course), and there is a children's playground. The park also features many trails. The property had been the estate of Edward B. Gallaher, owner (since 1917)() of the Clover Manufacturing Company on Main Avenue, which made industrial abrasives such as sandpaper. He began buying the land, which was previously farmland owned by different families, in the 1919s.)) After Gallaher's death, the property was left to his alma mater, Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, which continued to own it while Gallaher's wife lived there. After she died, the institute sold it to the city in 1965. The Gallaher mansion, still on the property, is a 20-room, Tudor Revival-style English fieldstone manor house built in 1930 or 1931 (ref May 5, 2010 Connecticut State Register of Historic Places, Hartford 468=bot/>).

In May 2006 the city Recreation and Parks Committee held a public hearing on proposed rules to restrict unleashed dogs to the orchard area of the park. The hearing drew strong opposition and the proposal was tabled. Spurred initially by the leash controversy, Friends of Cranbury Park formed that month both to support keeping many areas open to unleashed dogs and to improve the park in general. In July 2006 the group planted more than 50 perennials, including butterfly and Rose-of-Sharon bushes, to create a butterfly garden in the park.Koch, Robert, \\"Cranbury friends brave heat for butterflies\\", news article in The Hour of Norwalk, July 18, 2006, pages 1, A8 A new entrance and exit to the park, lined with daffodils planted by volunteers the previous October, were opened in May 2007. Near the new front gates, the city plans to make a partially refurbished pump house into an information center where a person will be assigned to track visitors and alert them to park regulations. One of the former entrances to the park, on Grumman Avenue, will become an exit, according to city officials. The Kensett Avenue entrance was to be closed and only used for emergencies or large events. Officials of the city Parks and Recreation Department said in early 2007 that it plans to restore the estate's formal gardens and small, tea house.

Among the playwrights who premiered works at the theater were Seán O'Casey, Eugène Ionesco, Edward Albee, Samuel Beckett, Terrence McNally and Lanford Wilson. Actors Milo O'Shea and Eileen Heckart trod the boards at the theater. On September 26, 1992 the White Barn Theatre Museum was set up by expanding and renovating a former small storage area off of the theater. Lortel bequeathed the property to her theater foundation, which later proposed putting a housing development and possibly a school on the site, something opposed by members of the Save Cranbury Association.

The building would be set back more than from the pond on the property and of the site would be preserved as open space in perpetuity. A co-director of the Save Cranbury Association, created by area residents who were concerned about potential use of the property, told the city Zoning Commission in 2007 that she supported the school's move. The building would cover 3.09 percent of the property, although zoning in the AA residence zone it is located in allows for 25 percent coverage. Only four or five schools in the city have as much land as the school. The school is designed to serve a maximum of 125 students, and the traffic analysis, septic system and space for parking are all planned with that level of enrollment in mind. As of 2007, the school provided one small bus for students.

Johann was the son of John Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Schwerin (1525–1576), and his wife Duchess Anna Sophia of Prussia (1527–1591). He was eighteen years old when his father died. A regency council was appointed that ruled in his name for the next nine years. The regency handed over the actual rule of his territories to him in 1585. He immediately faced problems he was ill-equipped to deal with, including massive debt and his uncle Christopher's demands for territorial concessions. After an especially harsh argument with his uncle, he committed suicide. Since suicides could not be buried in hallowed ground, a story was concocted which alleged that Johann had been killed by the devil as part of a pact with two women from Schwerin. The women were questioned: Katharina Wankelmuth, who died from the effects of torture, and Magdalena Rukitz, who was burned at the stake.

He made, with Léopold Roger and Jef de Bruycker, the first successful flight between Belgium and Congo (then the Belgian Congo). First World War Thieffry was born in Etterbeek, a municipality of Brussels, and went on to study law in Leuven (hence his nickname \\"The Flying Judge\\"). After qualifying he was conscripted into the Belgian Army, joining the 10th Regiment in 1913. At the start of the First World War he saw service as a staff attaché to General Leman, but was captured by the Germans. He escaped on a stolen motorcycle to the neutral territory of the Netherlands, where he was arrested by Dutch military police. Using his legal knowledge and Dutch language skills he managed to talk his way out of internment, and travelled to Antwerp to rejoin the Belgian army. In 1915, Thieffry joined the Compagnie des Ouvriers et Aérostiers —the Belgian Army Air Corps— and with some difficulty qualified as a pilot at Étampes. On 1 February 1916 he joined the 3rd Squadron as an observer for artillery, where he was appreciated for his exactitude and courage. He crash-landed so many aircraft that he was promptly assigned to a single-seat fighter squadron, as no one would fly with him! He was rapidly transferred to 5th Squadron (The Comets) under Captain Jules Dony based at De Panne in December 1916. His first confirmed victory was on 15 March 1917, flying a Nieuport 11. His second followed eight days later above Gistel, and his third on 12 May above Houthulst. His fourth was on 14 June—an Albatros D.III above Westende. The 5th Squadron then relocated to Les Moëres, and was equipped with Nieuport 17s. Thieffry gained official status as an \\"ace\\" when he shot down two German fighters over Diksmuide on 3 July. In August he received the first SPAD VII fighter in the Belgian Air Force, bought by the Belgian prince. He gained three more victories with it. On 31 August his aircraft was badly damaged by two German Albatros D.V fighters, but he managed to land behind the Belgian lines. He continued to fight and he claimed his 10th and last confirmed kill on 10 October 1917. He also had five 'probable' kills. This placed him third on the list of Belgian aces, behind Willy Coppens and André de Meulemeester. Shortly afterwards he was shot down and wounded by return fire from a German two-seater aircraft of FAA 227 over Kortrijk on 23 February 1918. He spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war in Germany. He tried to escape on 13 April 1918 but was caught ten days later. Flight to Congo At the end of the war Thieffry returned to Brussels by way of Switzerland, arriving home on 6 December 1918. He returned to his practice as a lawyer, but remained active in aviation, being one of the founders of Sabena in 1923. He then devised a plan to inaugurate an air link between Belgium and the Belgian Congo. At the start of 1925 he obtained permission from the government for this hazardous flight. Sabena supplied a Handley Page W8f, which Thieffry named \\"Princesse Marie-José\\", after getting the support of his friend King Albert. He left from Brussels (presumably from Haren Airport as the present national airport would only be created in 1940 at Melsbroek, its Zaventem terminal dating from 1956) on 12 February 1925, with mechanic Joseph \\"Jef\\" de Bruycker and co-pilot Léopold Roger, heading for N'Dolo airfield at Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). Thieffry himself acted as navigator. The flight plan called for stops at Marseille, Oran, Colomb-Bechar, Gao, Fort-Lamy, Bangui and Coquilhatville, and should have taken seven days. However strong adverse winds and a broken propeller meant that it took 51 days. Finally on 3 April, after 8,200 kilometres, they arrived at Leopoldville. The first air connection was made, and Thieffry returned to a hero's welcome in Belgium. He made two further attempts to reach Congo. The first on 9 March 1928 in an ACAZ C.2 with Joseph Lang and Philippe Quersin, did not get any further than Philippeville. The second on 26 June in a Stampe et Vertongen RSV.22-180,Hauet 1984, p.18 again with Philippe Quersin, also failed, this time ending in a marsh at Clapier, near Vauvert. Thieffry then developed a plan to set up an internal air service in Congo. During his second test flight in Congo on 11 April 1929, flying an Aviméta 92, Thieffry, with fellow flyer Gaston Julien, was killed in a crash close to Lake Tanganyika (only a mechanic survived). He was 36 years old. It would be another 10 years before a regular air service was established between Brussels and Kinshasa.

Education Having been exposed to the world of business, Puyat was inevitably drawn to a course in commerce for his higher education. This he pursued at the University of the Philippines where he topped his class. Even as a student, he was already immersed in intricate operations of finance and expense, of capital and production, and of management labor handling. He became an active member of the business-oriented Pan Xenia Fraternity. He was also later inducted into Upsilon Sigma Phi. Early career He became a member of the Rotary Club of Manila at about the same time that he was also a young professor of economics at the University of the Philippines. Puyat's skill in managing the family business caught the eye of the late President Manuel L. Quezon. At the time, the country was predominantly agricultural in activity and the President was advocating industrialization. Quezon named the young Puyat as dean of the College of Business Administration at the University of the Philippines when he was 33, becoming the youngest dean the UP ever had. An active member of international trades bodies, he acquired international stature in business. The Business Writers’ Association of the Philippines voted him \\"Business Leader of the Year\\" in 1948 and the Association of Red Feather Agencies voted him \\"Civic Leader of the Year\\" in 1949. In 1953, he received a plaque from the Community Chest of Greater Manila for “ outstanding services as one of the founders, first president and first campaign fund chairman “ of the body. The Philippine Institute of Public Opinion (PIPO) awarded him a certificate of honor for demonstrating national leadership in business, economics, the civic and political fields and for his distinguished service to the youth. Political career In the Philippine midterm elections of 1951, he was elected Senator and he served in the Philippine Senate until its closure by Martial Law in 1972. From 1967 he was the Senate President. As a legislator, Puyat created a little reforms and other things involving the dispensation of public works funds. Business activities He is founder of Manila Banking Corporation (now Chinabank Savings Bank), Manila Bankers Life Insurance Corporation and the Loyola Group of Companies. The Loyola Group of Companies is composed of Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc., Group Developers Inc. and Loyola Memorial Chapels and Crematorium Inc. He founded Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc. in 1968 and today it is the oldest Pre-need Company in continuous operation. Group Developers pioneered the concept of memorial parks in the Philippines with its two signature memorial parks in Marikina and Sucat. Loyola Memorial Chapels was the first to use modern cremation technology in the Philippines. Loyola Memorial Chapels has six branches: Commonwealth Avenue Quezon City, 20th Avenue Cubao Quezon City, Marikina, Guadalupe Makati City, Sucat Rd Paranaque City and Los Banos Laguna. Family background Puyat is the third child of Philippine Pioneer Industrialist Gonzalo Puyat and Nicasia Juco. He was trained early in life by his father, Don Gonzalo, in the trade of manufacturing billiard tables and bowling alleys. Eventually, he assisted in managing the family business of Gonzalo Puyat & Sons, the brand holder of AMF-Puyat, Puyat Steel, and Puyat Vinyl. Puyat was married to Eugenia Guidote, an accountant and pioneer member of the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants (PICPA), and a trained opera singer (soprano). They had seven children – Gil, Jr. (deceased), Vicente (deceased), Antonio (deceased), Victor, Jesusa, Alfonso and Eugenia Death In 1978, he was invested as a member of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. He died, 3 years later, on March 22, 1981 due to cardiac arrest, one of the complications of an asthma attack. He was buried on March 28, 1981 at Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina.

Biography =Early life= Worthy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, as the son of a wealthy obstetrician. He graduated Boston Latin High School and received a B.A. degree in sociology from Bates College, Lewiston, Maine, in 1942. Worthy was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, class of 1957. During World War II, Worthy was sentenced to one day in prison for dodging a physical examination for military service and failing to register at a conscientious objector's camp. In 1954, he voiced early opposition to American involvement in Vietnam after he visited Indo-China in 1953. =Right to travel controversies= In 1955, Worthy spent six weeks in Moscow, interviewing Nikita Khrushchev. In 1956, he managed to board a plane to Apartheid South Africa, but was deported after 36 hours. He then traveled to China (1956–57), where he interviewed Zhou Enlai and Cuba (1961), where he interviewed Fidel Castro, in violation of United States State Department travel regulations. At the time he entered China, Worthy was the first American reporter to visit and broadcast from there since the country's communist revolution in 1949.The Press: Ban Broken. 07 January 1957. While in China Worthy interviewed Samuel David Hawkins, an American soldier who was captured by the Chinese during the Korean War and defected to China in 1953. His passport was seized upon his return to the U.S. from China and American lawyers Leonard Boudin and William Kunstler represented Worthy in an unsuccessful lawsuit seeking the return of his passport. Without a passport, Worthy traveled to Cuba in the early days of Fidel Castro to report on the Cuban revolution. He was able to return to the U.S. in October 1961, showing his birth certificate and vaccination record at Miami Airport. However, in April 1962, he was summoned again to Miami, where he was tried and convicted for \\"returning to the United States without a valid passport.\\" During this time, he was placed under surveillance by the FBI. Worthy was again represented by Kunstler, who successfully persuaded a federal appeals court to overturn Worthy's conviction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found the restrictions unconstitutional. The court held that the government could not make it a crime under the Constitution to return home without a passport. Years later, Kunstler wrote in his autobiography, My Life As A Radical Lawyer, that the Worthy passport case was his \\"first experience arguing an issue about which I felt passionate,\\" was the \\"first time I had ever invalidated a statute,\\" and that success \\"confirmed my faith in the justice system.\\"Kunstler, William M., My Life As A Radical Lawyer, pp. 95-97 (Birch Lane Press 1994). The Committee for the Freedom of William Worthy was formed in 1962 and was chaired by A. Philip Randolph and Bishop D. Ward Nichols. In a telegram to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Randolph, James Farmer and James Forman noted that \\"white citizens who have come home without passports have never been prosecuted.\\" Folksinger Phil Ochs wrote a song called \\"The Ballad of William Worthy\\" about Worthy's trip to Cuba and its consequences. Worthy continued to travel to North Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and Iran. He only received a passport again in 1968. In 1981, the luggage of Worthy and two other journalists working with him, Terri Taylor and Randy Goodman, containing paperback copies of classified CIA documents, was seized by the FBI on their return from Iran. They subsequently won a suit on Fourth Amendment grounds and were awarded $16,000 in damages. =Civil rights activist= Worthy was a civil rights activist and member of organisations such as the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the NAACP or the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which advocated for a more balanced coverage of Cuba in the US media. In 1947, he participated in the Journey of Reconciliation together with other prominent civil rights leaders, in which they challenged state segregation laws on public transport. The action inspired the later Freedom Riders. In the early 1960s he was an outspoken critic of the civil rights movement for not going far enough to achieve civil rights in housing and all areas of American life. William Worthy was one of the most important political allies of Malcolm X. In the late 1960s, Worthy organized a rent strike against a Catholic hospital in New York City that attempted to tear down Worthy's apartment building and turn it into a parking lot. Worthy later wrote about those experiences in a critically acclaimed book, The Rape of Our Neighborhoods, published in 1976. Worthy was a reporter for the Baltimore Afro-American on and off from 1953 to 1980. He wrote a column and covered revolutions in Iran, Cuba, and China. Although a supporter of Malcolm X, he was critical of the Black Panthers in a 1969 column for \\"gratuitous and indiscriminate\\" 'Uncle Tom' attacks on virtually all the black bourgeoise\\" and their exposure to law enforcement due to \\"sloppy, inefficient, undisciplined organizational follow-through\\".Militants being killed, jailed or forced to run. Worthy, William. Afro-American (1893-1988). Baltimore, Md. 08 Mar. 1969: 1. =Teaching= While Worthy continued to work in the field of journalism, in the 1970s he was appointed as head of the African American journalism program at Boston University. However, the BU president, John Silber, removed Worthy as head of the program after Worthy criticized the BU administration and he supported BU campus workers who were attempting to unionize. Following his BU appointment, Worthy taught journalism at UMass Boston. William Worthy and Michael Lindsey co-taught the first class in Critical Journalism in the country at the College of Public and Community service, a branch of UMass Boston. Noam Chomsky was a guest lecturer. William Worthy also taught at Howard University in the 1980s and 1990s and held the Anneberg Chair. During most of the 1990s until 2005, Worthy lived in Washington, D.C., where he served as a special assistant to the dean of the School of Communications at Howard U. and served on the board of directors of the National Whistleblower Center. On February 22, 2008, the Nieman Foundation honored Worthy with the prestigious Louis M. Lyons Award. =Death and legacy= Worthy died in Brewster, Massachusetts on May 4, 2014, at the age of 92, of Alzheimer's disease. The late psychologist Kenneth B.

All acts of the Nebraska Legislature, the governor, and each governmental agency are subordinate to it. The constitution has been amended 228 times since it was first adopted in 1875, most notably to include the creation of a unicameral legislature. The constitution is also known as the Grasshopper Constitution due to the occurrence of Albert's swarm, an immense concentration of grasshoppers that scourged the Western United States during the constitutional convention which drafted the constitution in 1875. History On February 8, 1867, the United States Congress voted to admit Nebraska as a state, provided that suffrage was not denied to non-white voters. The bill admitting Nebraska as a state was vetoed by President Andrew Johnson, but the veto was overridden by a supermajority in both Houses of Congress, and Nebraska was admitted to the Union. After a failed attempt to ratify a constitution in 1870, in 1874, the Nebraska Legislature proposed a constitutional convention to meet to draft a new constitution. This proposal was overwhelmingly approved by a popular vote of 18,067 to 3,880, and the convention, consisting of sixty-nine members, began meeting May 11, 1875. The Nebraska Constitution, based partly upon the 1870 Constitution of Illinois, was adopted by the constitutional convention on June 12, 1875. This constitution became known as the Grasshopper Constitution, due to the occurrence of Albert's swarm, an immense concentration of grasshoppers that invaded the Western United States, at the same time as the constitutional convention. The constitution was ratified on October 12, 1875 after it was approved by a popular vote of 30,322 to 5,474, and entered into force on November 1, 1875. With the addition of 228 amendments since its adoption, including the creation of a unicameral legislature, the 1875 Nebraska Constitution remains the basic law of the state to this day. Preamble The Nebraska Constitution Preamble reads: : We, the people, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, do ordain and establish the following declaration of rights and frame of government, as the Constitution of the State of Nebraska.

Facts In the fall of 1988, staff at a hospital operated by the Medical University of South Carolina became concerned about the prevalence of so- called \\"crack babies,\\" as well as an increase in cocaine use among pregnant women receiving prenatal treatment at the hospital. In the spring of 1989, hospital staff began conducting urine screens on pregnant women, and referring the women who tested positive for counseling. Soon after the urine screenings began, the case manager in the hospital's obstetrics department heard that police in Greenville, South Carolina, were arresting pregnant women who used cocaine for child abuse. The theory behind the arrests was that the women's cocaine use was harmful to the fetuses. After reviewing the idea with counsel, the MUSC hospital began referring pregnant women who tested positive for cocaine to Charleston police for prosecution. Acting together, hospital staff and the police department developed a written policy for determining which pregnant women would be screened and, if they tested positive, prosecuted. Women would be selected for urine screening if they met certain criteria, such as prior lack of prenatal care, known history of drug or alcohol abuse, intrauterine fetal death, or abruptio placentae. If the women tested positive, they were referred to substance abuse counseling and threatened with prosecution. The hospital staff acknowledged that the \\"threat of law enforcement intervention... provided the necessary leverage to make the policy effective.\\" Women who tested positive a second time were arrested, even before giving birth. If the positive test occurred prior to the 28th week of pregnancy, the woman would be charged with simple possession. If she tested positive in the 28th week or later, she would be charged with possession and distribution to a person under age 18--to wit, the fetus. If she delivered the baby \\"while testing positive for illegal drugs,\\" the woman would also be charged with unlawful neglect of a child. Thirty pregnant women who had been arrested pursuant to the policy brought suit in federal court, challenging the MUSC policy of conducting warrantless, nonconsensual drug testing as violating their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The hospital and the city raised two primary defenses--first, that the women had consented to the searches; and second, that even if they had not consented, the searches were reasonable as a matter of law because they were justified by \\"special non-law-enforcement purposes.\\" The district court rejected the second defense because it concluded that the searches were conducted for law enforcement purposes. It submitted the first defense to the jury, instructing the jury that if the jury found that the women had consented, the jury should rule for the city and the hospital. The jury found that the women had consented, and thus ruled for the city and the hospital. The women appealed. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, but on the ground that the searches were justified as a matter of law by special non-law- enforcement needs. It reasoned that the interest in curtailing pregnancy complications and reducing the medical costs associated with maternal cocaine use outweighed what it characterized as a \\"minimal intrusion\\" on the women's privacy. The Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case.. Majority opinion MUSC is a state-operated hospital, so its employees are government actors subject to the Fourth Amendment. And a drug screen is a \\"search\\" covered by the Fourth Amendment. Because the Fourth Circuit had ruled only on the special needs claim, the Court assumed that the women had not consented to the drug screens. It then concluded that the special needs doctrine did not permit MUSC to conduct the drug screens according to its policy. The fact that the women neither knew of nor consented to the drug screens made this case different from the other cases in which the Court had applied the special needs doctrine. In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association, National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, and Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, the Court had sustained drug testing under the special needs doctrine in light of the subjects' consent; in Chandler v. Miller, the Court had struck down drug testing under the special needs doctrine despite the subjects' consent. In all four of those cases, the fact that the subjects consented lessened the invasion on the subjects' privacy. In this case, by contrast, the extent of the invasion on the women's privacy was far greater. \\"The reasonable expectation of privacy enjoyed by the typical patient undergoing diagnostic tests in a hospital is that the results of those tests will not be shared with nonmedical personnel without her consent.\\" By turning over the results of these medical tests to the police without the women's consent, MUSC violated this reasonable expectation of privacy. In this case, unless the special needs doctrine applied, this intrusion upon the women's expectation of privacy would amount to a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Court did not simply take the city and the hospital at their word that their motivations were beneficent; rather, the Court examined all the evidence available to determine whether the special needs advanced were divorced from the generalized interest in law enforcement. For example, in Railway Executives, the need to discover the cause of railway accidents justified the drug testing, and in Acton it was the need to promote a drug-free school environment. In this case, however, the very reason for the policy was to use the threat of arrest to motivate the women to abstain from using cocaine. This fact was evident from the fact that police and prosecutors assisted the hospital staff in developing specimen collection and chain-of-custody procedures, the nature of possible criminal charges to which the patients would be subject, and how the police would be notified and the arrests would be accomplished. \\"While the ultimate goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment and off of drugs, the immediate objective of the searches was to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes in order to reach that goal.\\" Because the MUSC plan used the threat of arrest as the means to accomplish its overall goal of inducing pregnant women to abstain from using cocaine, \\"this case simply does not fit within the closely guarded category of 'special needs.'\\" The mere fact that the hospital may have had benevolent motives cannot justify departing from the protections of the Fourth Amendment, especially in light of the heavy involvement of law enforcement with the hospital's program. Justice Kennedy pointed out that all searches, by definition, would uncover evidence of crime, and this says nothing about the \\"special needs\\" the search might serve. In this case, however, Kennedy agreed that \\"while the policy may well have served legitimate needs unrelated to law enforcement, it had as well a penal character with a far greater connection to law enforcement than other searches sustained under our special needs rationale.\\"Ferguson, 532 U.S. at 88-89 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). Dissenting opinion Justice Scalia reasoned that there was no \\"search\\" in this case because the hospital did not take the urine from the women without their consent. Urine, a waste product, would ordinarily be abandoned by the person who produces it; anyone who came across it would be free to do with it what they will, just as with garbage found on the sidewalk. There is no \\"search\\" in the case of garbage left on the sidewalk because its (former) owner no longer expresses any interest in keeping it private. For a similar reason, there is no \\"search\\" involved in performing a urine screen because the women voluntarily provided it to the hospital--and even if they had not, the women would have freely abandoned it anyway. Scalia also reasoned that even if the women had been coerced into providing the urine samples, it was not the government that coerced them. This was so, Scalia reasoned, even if these women had to provide the samples as a precondition of receiving their prenatal medical care.

It stars Sean Connery as police detective Johnson, who kills suspected child molester Kenneth Baxter (Ian Bannen) while interrogating him. The film explores Johnson's varied, often aggressive attempts at rationalizing what he did, revealing his true motives for killing the suspect in a series of flashbacks. Trevor Howard and Vivien Merchant appear in major supporting roles. Plot  Detective-Sergeant Johnson has been a police officer for 20 years and is deeply affected by the murders, rapes, and other violent crimes he has investigated. He is plagued by images of violence and is losing his mind under the strain. His anger surfaces while interrogating Kenneth Baxter, who is suspected of raping a young girl. By the end of the interrogation, Johnson has severely beaten Baxter who is then taken to the hospital where he later dies. Johnson is suspended for the beating and returns home for the night, getting into a violent argument with his wife Maureen. Two of Johnson's colleagues come to inform him that Baxter died in hospital and that Johnson must come to the station right away. The following day, Johnson is interviewed by Detective Superintendent Cartwright. During their long confrontation, flashbacks show the events of the previous night, when Johnson beats Baxter. The flashbacks portray Baxter - whose guilt or innocence is left ambiguous - taunting Johnson, insinuating that he secretly wants to commit the sort of sex crimes he investigates. Johnson at first flies into a rage and strikes Baxter, but he eventually admits that he does indeed harbour obsessive fantasies of murder and rape. He then tearfully begs Baxter to help him. When Baxter recoils from him in disgust, Johnson brutally beats him up, Baxter still taunting and laughing at Johnson as he falls to the ground, killing him. The film ends with another flashback, this time of Johnson attacking the police officers who pulled him off Baxter, and muttering \\"God...my God...\\" as he realises what he has done.

Connery was keen to shake off the image of James Bond and expand his range as an actor.https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/14/the-offence-sidney-lumet- dvd-review-sean-connery Connery had previously worked with Hopkins when the writer had co-scripted Thunderball and had seen the play during its original run in London in 1968. Seeing potential in the story, Connery bought the option on the film rights and asked Hopkins to adapt the script for the big screen.http://www.londonpubtheatres.com/this-story-of-yours/4594169452 Having made two films with Sidney Lumet, The Hill and The Anderson Tapes Connery appreciated his straightforward approach and offered him the job of directing. Lumet was keen to work with Connery again and accepted. Ian Bannen, who had also appeared in The Hill was hired as co- star.http://screenanarchy.com/2015/05/learning-from-the-masters-of-cinema- sidney-lumets-the-offence.html The film was shot on a small budget of £385,000 in March and April 1972 in and around Bracknell, Berkshire - notably the Wildridings Mill Pond area and Easthampstead's Point Royal. Interior sets were filmed at Twickenham Studios. The fight sequences between Connery and Bannen were choreographed, uncredited, by Bob Simmons, who had designed similar action scenes for the Bond films. The film remains Sir Harrison Birtwistle's only film score. United Artists released The Offence early in 1973. It was a critical success but a commercial failure and did not yield a profit for nine years, even going unreleased in several markets, including France, where it did not premiere until 2007. United Artists pulled out of the deal and the other project, a film version of Macbeth that Connery was to direct, was scotched by Roman Polanski's adaptation. Reception DVD releases In 2004, MGM UK released a DVD of the film which contained no extras or trailers. Simultaneous releases from MGM were made in other PAL format countries, such as Germany and Australia. On 20 October 2008, the film was again released on DVD in the UK by Optimum Releasing, again without extras or trailers. A French Region 2 DVD, preserving the film's original ratio of 1:1.66, became available in 2009. In April 2010, MGM put the film out on a U.S. DVD-R \\"on demand\\" for the first time. It is available as an exclusive from Amazon.com and contains no extras. In 2014 the film was released on Blu-ray in the US, and in 2015 it was released in the UK in the same format.

This device was set up at the starting line and consisted of an upright vertical bar that held a horizontal gate attached to it held up by a string. Each racer stood behind his own hysplex and all of the strings were centrally connected behind the runners, held by a referee. At the start of the race, the referee let go of all the strings; and consequently the starting gates fell at the same time, releasing the runners. Originally, they probably used an auditory signal for the start of the race, which, however, the athletes seemed to ignore and start too soon. Therefore, the officials had to devise special mechanisms to ensure the fair start of the race.Το Βήμα: Η ύσπληξ έδινε την εκκίνηση.Archaeology Archive. We know about the hysplex mechanism from depictions in surviving vases as well as from descriptions during the Hellenistic and Roman times. According to those sources, the hysplex were two horizontal stretched ropes at the height of the knees and the chest of the runners correspondingly. The end of the ropes was attached to two vertical poles that were not placed in the ground but on special mechanisms. The official would trigger the mechanism, the ropes would fall to the ground and the runners would spring onto the track.No. 1565: HYSPLEX.

It was performed at Whitehall Palace on Twelfth Night, 6 January 1615. King James I liked it so much that he ordered a repeat performance the following Sunday, 8 January. The masque was initially published in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616, and was included in the collected works from that point on. The show The masque portrays the god Mercury driving out a crew of alchemists that have abused his nature. The anti-masque, set in an alchemical laboratory, featured twelve alchemist figures, and twelve \\"imperfect creatures\\" wearing helmets shaped like alembics. After their dances, they were dispersed by the intervention of the god, and the scene changed to a \\"glorious bower,\\" in which Mercury, along with Prometheus and a personification of Nature, ushered in the dance of the masquing courtiers, who were twelve \\"Sons of Nature.\\" For source material for this work, \\"Jonson drew on Sendivogius's satirical Dialogus Mercurii, Alchymistae et Naturae....\\"M. K. Schuchard, Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture, Amsterdam, Brill Academic Publishers, 2002; p. 303. Jonson treats alchemists as charlatans in his text, as he does in his play The Alchemist. The words \\"at Court\\" in the full title of the work have provoked scholars to debate the actual meaning and significance of Jonson's text, since real alchemists were not particularly well represented at James's court. The work is clearly more symbolic than literal, though critics disagree on the specifics of its meaning. Politics The masque was significant in the internal politics of the Stuart Court, in that it marked a major step in the ascension of George Villiers as the new favorite of King James. For several years, Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset had held that wholly unofficial but very powerful position, as well as rising to major official posts such as Lord Chamberlain; but Somerset's role in the 1613 murder of Sir Thomas Overbury was becoming a major scandal. A Court faction opposed to Somerset -- which included Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, the patroness of John Donne and other poets, including Ben Jonson-- was actively promoting Villiers as a replacement for Robert Carr. To the date of the masque, their promotion of Villiers has not been enormously successful;Beatrice White, Cast of Ravens, London, John Murray, 1965; pp. 89-93 and ff. Mercury Vindicated was staged, at least in the estimation of some contemporaries, with the \\"principal motive\\" of \\"the gracing of young Villiers and to bring him on the stage.\\"E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 389 (spellings modernized). The plan was eventually successful, and Villiers, as the new Duke of Buckingham, replaced Somerset as the royal favorite, not merely through the remainder of James's reign but into the reign of his son and successor Charles I. Dating Scholars have disputed the order in which two of the Jonson- Jones masques were performed at Court. Traditionally, Mercury Vindicated was assigned to the 1614-15 Christmas holiday season, and The Golden Age Restored to the following 1615-16 season.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 389-91. C. H. Herford and Percy Simpson, in their edition of Jonson's works, argued that the two masques had been chronologically transposed in the 1616 Jonson folio, and that TGAR actually preceded Mercury Vindicated.Ben Jonson, Works, 11 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1925-52; Vol. 10, pp. 545-6. Their argument received some general acceptance for a time, but was refuted by later researchers.John Orrell, \\"The London Stage in the Florentine Correspondence, 1604-1618,\\" Theatre Research International 3 (1977-8)Martin Butler and David Lindley, \\"Restoring Astraea: Jonson's masque for the fall of Somerset,\\" English Literary History 61 (1994). The masques in the 1616 folio appear to be arranged in a consistent chronological order; Mercury Vindicated is second to last in the volume, and TGAR is the final work included. Recent scholarship tends to rely on the implications of the original text, and treats the two masques as presented in that order.Peter Holbrook, \\"Jacobean masques and the Jacobean peace,\\" in: David Bevington and Peter Holbrook, eds., The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998; p. 87.John Leeds Barroll, Anna of Denmark, Queen of England: A Cultural Biography, Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001; p. 211.

It was designed by architect Horace Trumbauer for industrialist Peter A. B. Widener and built between 1897 and 1900. Considered the largest surviving Gilded Age mansion in the Philadelphia area, it housed one of the most important Gilded Age private art collections of European masterpieces and decorative arts, which had been assembled by Widener and his younger son, Joseph. Peter A. B. Widener died at Lynnewood Hall at the age of 80 on November 6, 1915, after prolonged poor health. He was predeceased by his elder son George Dunton Widener and grandson Harry Elkins Widener, both of whom died when RMS Titanic sank in 1912. The structure changed hands a few times over the subsequent decades, with large portions of the estate grounds sold off in the 1940s, and has been predominantly vacant since 1952, when it was purchased by a religious group that started selling off the interior detailing. Description Built from Indiana limestone, the T-shaped Lynnewood Hall (dubbed \\"The last of the American Versailles\\" by Widener's grandson) measures long by deep. In addition to 55 bedrooms, the 110-room mansion had a large art gallery, a ballroom large enough for 1,000 guests, swimming pool, wine cellars, a farm, carpentry and upholstery studios, and an electrical power plant. A 2014 Philadelphia Inquirer article described the mansion as \\"dripping with silk, velvet, and gilded moldings, the rooms furnished with chairs from Louis XV's palace, Persian rugs, and Chinese pottery, the halls crammed with art by Raphael, Rembrandt, El Greco, Van Dyck, Donatello.\\" TIME magazine published an account of a lavish party held at Lynnewood Hall in 1932. Art collection The Raphael Room at Lynnewood Hall, William Bruce Ellis Ranken, 1917 From 1915 to 1940, the spectacular art collection at Lynnewood Hall was open to the public by appointment between June and October. In 1940, Joseph E. Widener donated more than 2,000 sculptures, paintings, decorative art works, and porcelains to the National Gallery of Art. P.A.B. Widener had originally planned for the collection to go to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The paintings included Raphael's Small Cowper Madonna, Bellini's The Feast of the Gods, eight van Dycks, two Vermeers, fourteen Rembrandts, and a series of portraits by Gainsborough and Reynolds. The sculptures included Donatello's \\"David\\" and Desiderio da Settignano's \\"St John the Baptist\\". Lynnewood Hall after Widener ownership Lynnewood Hall in January 2013 The grounds were used for training military dogs during World War II, and parcels of the land outside the property fence (see below) were sold to others after 1943. Lynnewood Hall suffered a general decline under the ownership of the Faith Theological Seminary, a religious group headed by Carl McIntire, which purchased it in 1952 for $192,000. During that ownership much interior detailing, such as mantels, walnut paneling, and landscape ornamentation was sold off in order to raise funds. This is evidenced by the 2006 auction of a French bronze figural fountain—one of only two major surviving Henri-Leon Greber commissions in America—originally installed at Lynnewood Hall. Lynnewood Hall was added to the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia's 2003 list for most endangered historic properties and is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. It is cited in Cheltenham Township's Comprehensive Plan as one of the township's cultural and historical resources, and in the township's Open Space Plan as a priority for preservation, warranting a conservation easement. The seminary and property was eventually foreclosed upon by the second-mortgagee, reportedly a one-time follower of McIntire. At according to Montgomery County Board of Assessment data, Lynnewood Hall currently is owned by the First Korean Church of New York. However, Lynnewood is not in use by that church and remains vacant. As of 2007, no significant stabilization or repair efforts have been evident. On June 25, 2007, the Cheltenham Township Planning Commission reviewed and denied a submitted request (Appeal No. 3225) by the First Korean Church of New York, Inc., owner of premises known as 920 Spring Avenue, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania from the Decision of the Zoning Officer for a variance from the rules and regulations of the Class R-2 Residence District as outlined in CCS 295-14. for the use of the premises as a Church and a Domicile for a Caretaker/Assistant Pastor instead of one of the permitted enumerated uses. This was the second such request, the first submitted in 1998, for a variance. That resulted in a lawsuit [see First Korean Church of New York v. Twp. of Cheltenham Zoning Bd; submitted to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court May 2001], which upheld Cheltenham's denial of the request. There have been negotiations ongoing of new ownership and possible renovations to the estate. Parties had hoped to have a plan finalized by the end of 2011. The proposed renovation could take the estate back to a private residence, and offer guest rooms to social elite and that of a high society bed and breakfast. Ongoing searches for previous pieces of the estate that belonged to Lynnewood Hall have been undertaken, and the total cost of renovations will be determined by the Buyer. In a state court decision handed down in February 2012 by Judge Norma L. Shapiro, the court ruled the First Korean Church of New York, Inc. did not qualify for tax exemption. In a rare interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer after this court ruling with Dr. Richard S. Yoon, video cameras were permitted inside Lynnewood Hall and the original seminary chapel. Dr. Yoon stated, “We have no choice (but) to relocate. We don’t want to fight any more.”Court document, First Korean Church of New York, Inc. v. Cheltenham Township Zoning Hearing Board and Cheltenham Township, Doc. No. 65-6389, February 29, 2012. The mansion's grounds, bordered by Ashbourne Road, Spring Avenue and Cedar Lane, are surrounded by their original wrought-iron fencing and gates with stone base and pillars, in marked contrast to that of nearby Trumbauer contemporary Whitemarsh Hall whose similar fencing (which encompassed a much greater acreage) was sacrificed for wartime scrap and rapid postwar development. A gatehouse and another staff outbuilding, of the same materials as Lynnewood, also still exist within the fence. The property within the fence has remained contiguous, never having been subdivided. This property was on the market for $11,000,000 in May 2019. A historical restoration architect estimated in 2014 that it would take about $50 million to restore the mansion to its former glory; however, Realtor Frank Johnson suggests the property could be renovated for $3 million to $8 million.

George Dunton Widener and Harry Elkins Widener, the eldest son and grandson of Peter A. B. Widener respectively, both died in the 1912 sinking of Titanic. George and his wife, Eleanor Elkins Widener, had traveled to Europe with their son Harry in 1912, booking a return passage on the ship's maiden voyage. George hosted a grand dinner party aboard the world's most luxurious ocean liner. The ship's captain, E.J. Smith, had to leave the party early to check on reports of icebergs ahead. George, his valet, Edwin Keeping, and Harry died in the sinking, while Eleanor and her maid survived by boarding a lifeboat with other First Class women. The library in Lynnewood was turned into a ballroom after the sinking of Titanic. Peter A. B. Widener died in his bed at Lynnewood Hall just three years later. The New York Times reported that he succumbed to \\"old age and deep sorrow caused by the loss of his son and his grandson in the Titanic disaster.\\" References External links * Site dedicated to Lynnewood Hall and its preservation. * Historical Information * Historical aerial photos of the estate in the 1920s and 1930s * Aerial video of Lynnewood Hall Houses in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Widener family Neoclassical architecture in Pennsylvania Houses completed in 1900 Elkins Park, Pennsylvania Horace Trumbauer buildings ","title":"Lynnewood Hall"},{"id":"9682630","text":"P191 StarobilskAmerican Island-class boats “Sloviansk” and “Starobilsk” have arrived to Odessa is an of the Naval Forces of Armed Forces of Ukraine. Originally she was named for Drummond Island, Michigan and then renamed for Starobilsk town. Drummond was commissioned October 19, 1988 at Bollinger Shipyard in Lockport, Louisiana, and was last homeported in San Juan, Puerto Rico. With a top speed in excess of and a cruising speed of , the ship is capable of enduring unsupported operations for six days and accommodates two officers and sixteen enlisted personnel. The Coast Guard's first Sentinel class cutters were stationed in Florida, replacing Island Class cutters like the Drummond. History = Serving in the U.S. Coast Guard = Bahamas. Since commissioning, Drummond has served in the U.S. Coast Guard’s busiest district and has been decorated for her involvement in a variety of operations. In 1992 and 1994, Drummond was awarded the U.S. Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation while working with other U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy units that combined for the safe interdiction of over 20,502 Haitian migrants at sea. Originally homeported in Port Canaveral, Florida, Drummonds home port was changed to Key West in the summer of 2002. Typical patrols in Key West's area of operations involved search and rescue, alien migrant interdiction operations, fisheries law enforcement, counter narcotics operations, and homeland security. More recently, she shifted homeports to Miami Beach in support of the Coast Guard's new effort to maximize the operational hours of the patrol boats in the Seventh District by utilizing a dual-crew manning concept. In April 2004, Drummond again returned to Haiti in support of Operation ABLE SENTRY and Operation SECURE TOMORROW as that country’s political and economic situation continued to generate an exodus of migrants. In 2005, Drummond was again awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for her efforts in stemming the illegal flow of Cuban migrants in the Florida Straits. Drummond also was credited for saving more than $500,000 in property during this period in search-and-rescue cases, including a daring rescue of a dismasted sailboat during Tropical Storm Arlene. Since 2004, Drummond is credited with interdicting over 550 illegal Cuban migrants in the Florida Straits, on eight go-fast vessels and 26 homebuilt boats and rafts. Drummond has also recovered nearly 120 illegal migrants from various Bahamian islands, working closely with the Royal Bahamas Defence Force. In the past two years, Drummond has cared for 1600 illegal migrants on her decks while conducting 32 politically sensitive repatriations to Cabanas, Cuba. = Transfer to the Ukrainian Naval Forces = Unloading of the boats in Odessa. On September 27, 2018, the Drummond and the USCGC Cushing were formally transferred to Ukraine, after their retirement. The two vessels were shipped, as deck cargo, and arrived in Odessa on October 21, 2019. The patrol boat was renamed after the Donbass town Starobilsk.

The station is owned by Gold Coast Broadcasting and airs a Top 40 (CHR) format. The KFYV studio is located in Ventura and the transmitter is situated among several other radio and television towers off Red Mountain Fire Road in Ventura. KFYV uses two booster stations to strengthen its signal: KFYV-FM1 in Oak View and KFYV-FM2 in Ventura, both at the 105.5 FM frequency. History =KOVA= The station first signed on January 4, 1972 as KOVA. It was owned by Fred Hall and played a variety of big band, adult standards, and classical music, together forming a radio format described as \\"Good Music\\". The station also aired reruns of old radio shows such as Jack Benny, The Lone Ranger, and The Shadow. In March 1979, Hall sold KOVA to Frank Spencer for $375,000. =KMYX — \\"K-Mix 106\\"= New station general manager and longtime Ventura County broadcaster Michael R. Thomas enacted sweeping changes. Initially, Thomas switched KOVA to an easy listening format after KACY-FM (104.7 FM) dropped it in favor of top 40 as KCAQ (Q105). That format was short-lived, however, as he flipped the station to an urban contemporary format branded \\"K-Mix 106\\" on January 24, 1984, adopting new call letters KMYX. K-Mix was programmed by Howard Thomas (known on-air as \\"H.T.\\"), son of the station's GM. The elder Thomas purchased the station from Spencer in 1986. In the Arbitron Spring 1987 ratings report, KMYX landed in a three-way tie for first place in the Oxnard- Ventura market with KCAQ and regional Mexican outlet KOXR overall, beating Q105 among adults 18-34. As the 1980s drew to a close, so did the K-Mix 106 era. Howard Thomas died in an automobile accident in Los Angeles in August 1988. Michael Thomas assumed programming duties, changing KMYX's format to country music in March 1989 with on-air talent that included local radio veterans K.M. \\"The Rebel\\" Richards, Bob Stevens, and Steve Carr. Taking over as GM was Pat Finn, who would also host the 1990 revival of The Joker's Wild. The country format only lasted several months. =KKUR/KTND/KKBE= On November 8, 1989, Thomas sold KMYX to Los Angeles-based ownership group Eric/Chandler Communications of Ventura, Inc., who changed the call letters to KKUR and the format to hot adult contemporary. That group sold the station in September 1992 to Buena Ventura Inc., headed by George Duncan and Ronald Greenberg, for $725,000 — less than half the 1989 purchase price of $1.8 million. In March 1994, KKUR flipped to country as KTND, \\"Thunder 105.5\\". In December 1996, Gold Coast Broadcasting purchased KTND and AM sister station KXSP for $2 million. The new owner adopted a soft adult contemporary format branded \\"The Breeze\\" with new call letters KKBE. =KFYV — \\"Live 105-5\\"= In 2003, KKBE was relaunched as KFYV, a contemporary hit radio (CHR) station branded \\"Live 105-5\\", under the guidance of program director and morning personality Mark Elliott. Elliott, a veteran of the Oxnard-Ventura radio market, joined Gold Coast Broadcasting as the Director of Programming and Broadcast Operations after leaving Cumulus Media-owned station KBBY-FM.

(CSNF) was the name of a grassroots organisation which grew from a campaign started in Perth, Western Australia, in 1975, as a response to the development of a woodchipping industry in the south-west jarrah and karri forests of Western Australia. The Manjimup woodchip project aroused significant levels of protest in Perth and the South West region out of public concern that inadequate measures had been made for conservation alongside exploitation of the south west hardwood forests. The public figures and faces of the CSNF at the time—Beth Schulz, Basil Schur, and Neil Bartholomaeus—each gained extensive coverage on the local media during public rallies at Wagerup and elsewhere. At the times that the CSNF tried to cope with the issues of governmental and forestry business pressures to develop woodchipping, and mining in the jarrah forest, another group started as well—the South West Forests Defence Foundation. There was co-operation between the groups on some issues as well as joint publications. The CSNF subsequently campaigned in response to mining by Alcoa in the jarrah forest on the Darling Scarp, conducting rallies and protests outside the alumina refinery construction site at Wagerup in February, May, and August 1979. It was involved in submissions to Australian federal and Western Australian state inquiries on forestry through the late 1980s. Many members of CSNF went on to become involved in other groups and associations, such as West Australian Forest Alliance, Great Walk Networking, and other groups usually associated with the Conservation Council of Western Australia. Many of these groups did not gain the extensive national attention and subsequent political ramifications that, for example, the Tasmanian Wilderness Society did with its early 1980s No Dams campaign for the Franklin River, which influenced Tasmanian domestic politics for a decade. However, they did have coverage in local media for their particular issues, and despite the lack of national attention they had marked impact on the ways that all levels of government proceeded with environmentally problematic issues.

Tennessee. Manufactured by Gerstlauer, the Euro-Fighter model is heavily-themed as a haunted mining operation from the 19th century. The roller coaster was Dollywood's largest single investment in the park's history at the time, costing $17.5 million to construct. A large portion of the track is located indoor, where the ride utilizes a series of special effects. It was the first Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter installation in the United States and had the steepest drop of any coaster in North America at the time of its opening. The ride was installed by Ride Entertainment Group, who handles all of Gerstlauer's operations in the Western Hemisphere. Ride experience The ride's story and themes are introduced in the queue as guests enter. Visitors pass old newspaper articles and signs condemning an old abandoned mine shaft, and the queue winds around a rocky area before climbing stairs to the boarding area. During this time, guests occasionally hear recorded audio stating, \\"If the canary ain't tweetin'...you'll be sleepin'!\\" Quick-paced banjo music can also be heard playing in the background. After boarding, the 8-passenger car launches quickly out of the station. A miner's evil laugh echoes down the first small drop as the car rushes toward the first curve. A wall full of cawing crows and a caged canary watch the car as it passes. As it turns the corner, passengers come face to face with a giant spinning rock crusher. The cart quickly drops beneath the grinder and whips around a hairpin curve. As the car slows to a stop, a crow caws loudly from somewhere above and a small lever labeled \\"mine gas\\" cranks into the on position. The car ascends approximately up a vertical wall of track at a 90-degree angle. Graffiti litters the sheet metal walls on both sides. After reaching the top, the car drops down a short hill outside the ride building. A sign advertises \\"Burnt out bridge ahead!\\", and the car swerves across the trestle. A steep drop then sends the vehicle careening up a vertical U-turn. The car proceeds to swing around a few small helices before plunging back into the abandoned mine building, where it slows down. A spotlight turns on illuminating the canary cage seen earlier. A lightning special effect flashes from the shaft ahead, as the canary turns over on its perch, to indicate it died. The car begins to ascend the mine shaft at as crows peer out from behind the broken boards surrounding the shaft. A window effect above riders shows the storm going on outside the shaft. Another flash of lightning strikes the top of the simulated tower protruding above, which collapses onto the window. Now in darkness, the car stops at the peak of the hill. A lit fuse is heard in the distance and soon becomes visible, snaking along both sides of the car. A green lantern suddenly illuminates, sitting on top of a mound of dynamite in boxes, hooked to the quickly approaching fuse.

This species prefers areas with rock/sand substrate or areas with plentiful vegetation. It can grow to a length of TL. General Occurring throughout the lake, Nimbochromis polystigma is a piscivorous fish, often preying upon juvenile cichlids. The local name for the fish is Kaligono, meaning 'sleeper' in the chiCheŵa language. It shares this name with other Nimbochromis species due to their hunting technique, which involves lying motionless on the bottom, sometimes on its side as if feigning death, until small fish approach to investigate, then pouncing on the prey. When hunting this way their colour will fade, apparently as the whiter colour attracts more small cichlids. They will also sometimes launch ambush attacks on small fish from the cover of vegetation, with their colouration acting as disruptive camouflage. Like most Lake Malawi cichlids, Nimbochromis polystigma is a mouthbrooder, with the female carrying her young in her mouth for two to three weeks before being released. In the aquarium Nimbochromis polystigma is a relatively peaceful species, as long as its cohabitants are not small enough to be considered prey. It's an enthusiastic feeder, and will eat all of the usual foods given to cichlids, and has the rather endearing habit of leaping from the water to try to get at food or fingers. In aquaria it can grow to 30 cm (12 in), and requires a large aquarium—at least 300 litres (80 US gal)—and can be kept with other haplochromines and most mbuna. It is best to have some rocks for them to hide in when threatened, but they also need room to swim. References *Konigs, A. Malawi Cichlids in Their Natural Habitat, 3rd edition. Cichlid Press. 2001.

A native of New York, he was selected as the first Supreme Judge with probate powers in February 1841 in what would become the state of Oregon. Although the meeting where he was selected did not produce an acting government, he also took over the executive and legislative powers as the first person in Oregon's history. The meeting was the first of several meetings, presided by him since 1842, that led to a Provisional Government in the Willamette Valley in May 1843. Early life Babcock was born in the state of New York around 1808 where he received medical training. He came to what was then the unorganized Oregon Country from New York while working for the Methodist Mission run by Jason Lee.Corning, Howard M. (1956). Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, p 16. Babcock arrived in Oregon in 1840 aboard the ship Lausanne with his wife and one son. They traveled with Jason Lee’s reinforcements for the mission that was re- located to present day Salem, Oregon. The Lausanne had sailed around Cape Horn and included future governor George Abernethy and the Reverend Gustavus Hines. Judgeship Babcock was selected at the Champoeg Meeting in David Leslie's home on February 18, 1841, to be the first Supreme Judge for the settlers of the region. There was a need for a probate court in order to deal with the estate of Ewing Young. Young had become a wealthy rancher due to his economic activities that included participation in the Willamette Cattle Company in 1837. At the same time Babcock's election had also been a compromise after French Canadians had failed to elect William J. Bailey for Governor as well as English Americans had failed to elect Babcock.DR. IRA L. BABCOCK, biography from Oregon Government, retrieved 15 May 2017A History of Oregon, 1792-1849, retrieved 15 May 2017 As the settlers were not able to agree on the form of the discussed government, Babcock also received executive and in fact legislative duties because there had been no copy of the New York laws in the country that had been proposed for usage. In 1842, Babcock helped to organize the Oregon Institute as a school for the children of the American settlers. After holding the Supreme Judge title for two years, in which he had presided over a constitutional committee of six people at several Champoeg or so called Wolf Meetings, Babcock also was President at the discussions on May 2, 1843, when he called for a vote and the settlers thereby gave themselves a Provisional Government by narrowly accepting the committee's report with 52–50 votes. Shortly after that he took his family to the Sandwich Islands for one year. After returning he was elected as Supreme Judge again, but left Oregon permanently in November 1844. After leaving Oregon he joined the United States Army and served as a surgeon. In 1870, he returned to Oregon on a visit.

It is published by Forum Communications, which bought it in 2006. History The Budgeteer News was founded in 1931 by Herb Palmer, who served as its first publisher. His son, Dick, was the second publisher and continued to write a weekly column for many years after his departure.Richard Faye Palmer-obituary Over the years, the paper has had various names, including \\"The Budgeter,\\" \\"The Family Budgeter,\\" and \\"The Budgeteer Press.\\" For years, the paper was essentially a shopper with columns from its publisher, but not much other original editorial content. In the mid-1990s, Murphy McGinnis Media purchased the paper and transformed it into the Budgeteer, with the slogan: \\"Good News for Great People Like You.\\" The paper upped its staffing levels and began publishing twice a week. Despite positive community reaction, revenue could not support the expanded staff or the mid-week edition. The Budgeteer went back to once a week, cut staff and - in its most dramatic change - went from a traditional broadsheet to a tabloid- format newspaper. In August 2007, the Budgeteer went through a redesign. The type is a little bigger, with more spacing between the lines.

It was created by BRB Internacional with animation by Colorland Animation Production, written by Francesca Melandri, Giovanni Romoli and Lamberto Bava, produced by Mediaset, Telecinco and Grupo Planeta, with music by Mark Bradley and Terry Wilson. A 75-minute animated film Fantaghirò: Quest for the Kuorum edited together using footage from the series was released in 2000. Plot The series uses elements from all five of the live-action Fantaghirò movies, combining and rearranging various events and characters appearances. The main theme throughout the series is the love between Princess Fantaghirò and King Romualdo, which changes and affects everyone around them. The main villains throughout the series are the Black Witch and her master, the lord of evil Darken, both of whom appear from the very first episode. Various places and people that were not named in the films have been given names in the cartoon adaptation, such as the kingdoms of Tuan and Dana, which are Fantaghirò and Romualdo's respective home kingdoms. The series revolves around the adventures of Fantaghirò, the youngest daughter of King Hadrian of the kingdom of Tuan. She is brave and outspoken, and refuses to be demure and obedient like all women are supposed to be. Initially unknown to her, Fantaghirò was born with a very specific destiny, which is to conquer all the evil in the land. Her passion comes from her great love for Romualdo, the prince of the kingdom of Dana. Throughout the series the Black Witch and Darken attempt to separate or destroy both Fantaghirò and Romualdo. Characters Many of the characters from the live-action films are in this animated series, but some have been renamed or changed. There also a number of new characters added. Among the film characters that have been brought over to the series are Fantaghirò, Romualdo, Fantaghirò's father, Catherine, Caroline, Cataldo, Ivaldo, the Black Witch, Darken, Tarabas, Xelesia, and Golden Mane. However, the character of Tarabas, who was a very prominent character in the third and fourth films, is only a minor character in this series.

It is the third largest ski area in Maine, in terms of number of trails (66), number of lifts (5), snowmaking percentage (85%), vertical drop (2000 ft) and skier days.Ski Maine AssociationSaddleback Maine After almost 5 years of closed doors, Saddleback Mountain was sold to the Arctaris Impact Fund and is set to open in November, 2020. All of the trail names at Saddleback are named after famous fishing flies created in Rangeley by anglers Carrie Stevens, Bud Wilcox, and Dick Frost. Some of these fly names include Supervisor, Peachy's Peril, Royal Tiger, and America. All of the chairlifts at Saddleback are named after popular fly fishing rivers, such as the Rangeley River, South Branch (of the Dead River), and the Magalloway River. Terrain Saddleback's terrain consist of 38% Beginner trails (25 trails), 29% Intermediate trails (19 trails) and 33% Advance and Expert trails (22 trails). There are also five (5) ski lifts, which include two, fixed grip quads, two fixed grip doubles, and a T-bar The mountain is broken up into three sections, the upper, middle, and lower sections, which consist of terrain from double black diamond (hardest) to green circle (easiest). Each section of the mountain is serviced by a variety of lifts. The lower mountain consist of 18 beginner trails, and is serviced by the South Branch Quad, and the Sandy Double Chair. The terrain is very mild and flat, and most of it is located below the base lodge which helps to keep skier traffic to a minimum. Saddleback sells a separate ski ticket on certain weekends and holidays, which is only good for the South Branch Quad. This allows for the ski area to reduce the price of the ticket because it only allows access to a limited amount of terrain. Since the new ownership, eleven new trails have been cut in this area and two quad chairlifts has been installed.Saddleback Maine Trail Map Saddleback Maine seen from Maine State Route 16 The middle mountain consist mostly of intermediate terrain, with a few expert trails thrown in. The terrain is serviced by the Rangeley Chair and the Cupsuptic T-Bar. One beginner trail Hudson Highway (a former jeep trail) runs from the top of the Rangeley Chair and Cupsuptic T-Bar to the base area. This section of the mountain consist of notable trails such as Grey Ghost, which has many head walls, flats, and curves, making it a fun and popular trail. Blue Devil is another popular trail because of its classic New England style, which is very curvy and narrow to protect the snow on the trail from the wind. Since the new ownership, four new trails have been cut in this area. The upper mountain, also referred to as \\"The Kennebago Steeps, consisting of mostly advanced and expert trails\\". It is serviced solely by the Kennebago Quad chairlift, which was installed in the summer of 2008 to replace the Kennebago T-Bar. It has such famous trails as Muleskinner, Intimidator, Governor, and Nightmare Glades. It also has two intermediate trails, Tri- Color, which runs from the summit, and America, which is the continuation of the former jeep trail. Since the new ownership, seven new trails have been cut in this area. In 2013, Saddleback cut an extensive glade trail named \\"Casablanca\\", and skiers and riders have travelled to the mountain to experience this steep trail. History Former owner John Christie, former General Manager Warren C. Cook, and Meagan Roberts. =The 1990s= Through the 1990s, the ski resort's prior owner, Donald Breen, engaged in a protracted dispute with conservation advocates over the Appalachian Trail corridor, which runs across the ridge at the top of the ski resort. Breen settled the dispute with the National Park Service, which manages the trail, in 2000, and in the fall of 2003, Breen sold most of the resort to the Berry family, for $7.5 million. =The 2000s: Ownership by the Berry Family= The Berry family built a new base lodge, six new trails, and a new quad chairlift (the resort's first new chairlift in 30 years) in 2004. In 2007, the Maine Land Use Regulation Commission approved Saddleback's 10-year development plan, which calls for a major expansion of lifts, trails, vacation homes, and other facilities.\\"Saddleback's 10-Year Plan Approved.\\" Sunjournal.com. August 10, 2007. In the summer of 2008, a second quad chairlift was built to replace the Kennebago t-bar at the top of the ski area, along with new trails. The Kennebago Quad is a Dopplemayr quad chairlift that has replaced the Kennebago T-bar, and services 15 trails and glades. The new chair provides easy and faster access to the spectacular high-elevation advanced terrain with incredible views of the lakes and Western Maine Mountains. In 2009 a new yurt was built at the base of the Kennebago Quad lift. It is equipped with heat, power, and composting toilets. It offers hot and cold beverages, soups, chowders, sandwiches, and snacks. A glade area, Casablanca, was cut between Muleskinner and Black Beauty for the 2009-10 ski season. In 2010, two new Pisten Bully Snow Groomers were added to the mountain's fleet of groomers. During the summer of 2010 a new glade area was cut between Jane Craig and Professor. This section is unnamed. Since the purchase in 2004, terrain has been increased by over 44%, snowmaking increased to over 85%, the grooming fleet has been replaced, and the Rangeley Chair has been upgraded and lengthened so it can be easily accessible from the base lodge. A new Lodge has been built, along with three new condominium complexes, and the mountain Saddleback's real estate office known as Saddleback Village.Saddleback Village =The 2010s: New Ownership= In December 2012, The Berry's announced that Saddleback Mountain was for sale. Of 400 acres of land, the mountain was placed on the market for $12 million, that include ski trails, lifts, the base loge and the surrounding 121 condominium units. However, the family still hopes to retain 7,600 undeveloped acres around the ski area. Later, Saddleback entered into a lease/purchase agreement for Oquossoc Cove Marina. = Seasonal Closing = During the summer of 2015, the Saddleback owner, Mark Berry, announced in a release that the ski resort will not open for the 2015–2016 season unless the outdated and slow Rangeley Double Chairlift (GMD Mueller) was replaced; costing them nearly $3 million. The 4,717 Rangeley Chairlift does not transport enough people to the mountain as it should and creates a long line at the base. Berry stated that \\"...we’ve been actively seeking the necessary financing to replace the chairlift, however time is running out. We only have a few weeks to make this work. In order to open this winter, we need to order the new lift by early August.\\" It is unknown whether the mountain will open or not. As the year progressed into 2016, Saddleback officials said they were not opening for February school vacation week, keeping its patrons concerned and sending the future of the mountain into uncertainty. Though not yet declared by Saddleback, Joey Morton, a local from Rangeley \\"doubts the mountain will open at all this winter season.\\" Furthermore, the lack of snow this winter and the uncertainty of Saddleback's opening affects the local businesses and the town of Rangeley. =Majella Ownership= Since the Berry family was not able to replace the Rangeley Double Chairlift in 2014 and 2015, the mountain and lifts have sat idle. On June 28, 2017, it was announced that the Australian Majella Group had an agreement to purchase Saddleback from the Berry family. The Majella Group had contacted Doppelmayr, who had already begun the survey, engineering, and design work. It was announced that the Rangeley Double Chairlift would be replaced with a new Fixed-Grip Quad Chairlift that can handle 1,500 riders per hour and that the Cupsuptic T-Bar would be replaced with a new Wind-Resistant T-Bar that can handle 1,200 riders per hour. If the new lifts are installed, Saddleback would feature one of the newest lift systems in all of New England. However, with the recent arrest of Sebastian Monsour, CEO of the Majella Group in 2018 on fraud in Australia, it is unknown once again when and if Saddleback will reopen. Critics have questioned Monsour's intentions after he was quoted in Maine news reports as saying he was motivated by the EB-5 program that offers foreigners permanent residency if they invest in certain U.S. real estate projects. June 2018, Monsour was arrested and charged with defrauding a Chinese investor out of $5 million after his Australian office was raided. It was unclear how his arrest impacts the sale agreement. = Arctaris Impact Fund Offer = In March 2019, the Arctaris Impact Fund based in Boston made an undisclosed offer to purchase Saddleback Mountain. They also pledged between $25 to $30 million after the sale to help revitalize the mountain after having sat idle since the 2014-2015 ski season. After the arrest of the last failed buyer, Sebastian Monsour who was charged with defrauding a Chinese investor, Saddleback's future was uncertain. The news of an offer was sent out through an email by Andy Shepard, former CEO of the Outdoor Sports Institute and Tom Federle, a Portland attorney. The investment group is worth $500 million. Shepard and Federle have been trying to find a buyer for the mountain for the past four years until now. They now are working with the firm to purchase the mountain. Shepard has stated that \\"[w]e have been very impressed with their commitment and capacity to not only buy the mountain, but doing so with a long term view to make the mountain successful.\\" He further told the press that this investment firm's offer is the \\"real deal and that [he's] hopeful for the Berry family and for the people of western Maine that [we] can get a deal done.\\" The two have strong connections to the region and Saddleback. Federle owns a Saddleback condo and Shepard has strong interest in preserving the mountain and its role in the economy of the region. = Arctaris Impact Fund Purchase = After months of negotiations, the Berry family agreed to sell the ski resort to Arctaris Impact Fund after seven months of negotiations. The new general manager of Saddleback Mountain, Andy Shepard announced he hopes to reopen the mountain for the 2020–2021 season, sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2020. The mountain has been closed since the 2014–2015 season. On January 31, 2020, Saddleback was officially sold to Arctaris Impact Fund. In February, a new Doppelmayr high speed quad was announced along with lodge upgrades, new snowmaking, and a fair ticket pricing approach. On March 18, the new Saddleback Mountain website went live, which allowed for season pass and locker sales, as well as a section detailing the investments for the 2020–2021 season. During February, March, and April 2020, the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic caused massive disruption to the ski industry and global economy, however, Saddleback announced that their investments are moving forward as expected, with the opening date still set for Autumn of 2020.

The eight-part television event miniseries stars Cynthia Nixon, Miranda Richardson, Peter Firth, Ben Chaplin, Charlotte Riley, Sarah Gadon and Tom Weston-Jones. It was directed by Michael Caton-Jones who also directed the historical epic Rob Roy.  Plot summary  The novel begins in the fictional city of Kingsbridge, England in the year 1327. Four children - Merthin, Caris, Gwenda, and Merthin's brother Ralph - head into the woods on All Hallows Day. Together the children witness two men-at-arms killed in self-defence by Sir Thomas Langley, aided by Ralph. The children then flee, with the exception of Merthin, who helps the wounded Sir Thomas bury a letter with instructions to dig up and deliver it if and when Sir Thomas should die. After this Sir Thomas flees to Kingsbridge and seeks refuge in the monastery, becoming a Benedictine monk, while the four children swear never to speak of what they saw. During mass at All Hallows, Gwenda is forced by her father to steal the money that Sir Gerald was supposed to use to pay his debts to Kingsbridge Priory. Forced to default on these debts he is disgraced, his property confiscated and he and his wife are left as pensioners to the Priory. This disgrace drives their sons Merthin and Ralph to seek to regain the family's fortune and honour. Ralph is accepted as a squire under the Earl of Shiring, while Merthin is pushed to the far less prestigious role of apprenticing himself as a carpenter. Ten years later, in 1337, Caris and Merthin are in love. When a section of the vault of the Kingsbridge Cathedral collapses Merthin, now an apprentice carpenter, shows his genius by developing a cheaper means of repair than his master. Ralph, now a squire to Earl Roland of Shiring, provokes a fight and has his nose broken by a handsome peasant from Gwenda's village named Wulfric, for whom Gwenda has a hopeless infatuation. Gwenda is sold for a cow by her father to be prostituted at an outlaws' camp. She kills one of the outlaws while he is raping her, and escapes. She is followed by her buyer, but is able to drown him when the Kingsbridge bridge collapses, a tragedy that kills many, including all of Wulfric's immediate family and Prior Anthony of Kingsbridge (this latter has from hands of Godwyn's mother). In the midst of the disaster Ralph saves Earl Roland's life and is rewarded with the lordship of Gwenda's village of Wigleigh. Gwenda and Wulfric return to Wigleigh and attempt to gain Wulfric the inheritance of his father's land. The inheritance is eventually denied by Ralph because of the grudge he bears against Wulfric. Due to his poor prospects, Wulfric's beautiful wife-to-be, Annet, leaves him. By months of intensively showing Wulfric her love and devotion, Gwenda finally wins his love and they marry. Gwenda then tries to win Wulfric back his lands by having sex with Ralph, but Ralph does not uphold his end of the deal. Gwenda's first son, Sam, is conceived through this liaison. Ralph, as lord, is merciless and brutal, and he winds up raping Annet as well. Wulfric does not permit this outrage to go unpunished, and lodges a complaint against Ralph with the Earl on her behalf; though English law of the time forbids rape regardless of the perpetrator's social status, it is very risky for peasants to sue their lord. Gwenda, despite her consternation at her husband's defence of his former sweetheart, helps by interceding with Lady Philippa about Ralph's case. Thanks to her intervention, Ralph is convicted of rape and is sentenced to hang, but with the Earl Roland's connivance, he manages to escape and becomes an outlaw. After robbing and murdering many people on the road to Kingsbridge, he is eventually captured with Merthin's help, and is once again set for execution, but since the king has declared war on France (launching the Hundred Years' War in May 1337) he is granted a royal pardon on condition that he fight in the war (in 1339, when Edward invades northeast France). Meanwhile, the monastery's Sacrist, Godwyn, a nephew of Prior Anthony, outwits his opponents and wins the priory election in an overwhelming victory. Godwyn claims to be a reformer, but turns out to be even more conservative and quickly begins to clash with the townsmen on a number of issues, including the funding and building of a fabulous new bridge designed by Merthin and allowing the townspeople to full wool for a growing fabric industry. Caris, who becomes the de facto alderman, is a particular problem, leading the campaign to get for Kingsbridge the status ofa Royal Borough and emancipate the townspeople from the Priory's control. Despite being her cousin, Godwyn charges Caris with witchcraft hoping to have her executed to get her out of the way. To escape execution, Caris agrees to join the Kingsbridge nunnery. With his impending marriage to Caris made impossible, Merthin leaves Kingsbridge for Florence, Italy to pursue his building career. He becomes a highly successful and rich architect, and after hearing that Caris had taken nun's vows he marries Sofia, the daughter of one of his Italian clients. Eight years later (in 1346), Godwyn steals money from the substantially more profitable nuns in order to build for himself a luxurious palace. In July 1346, Caris seeks to petition the bishop to redress this theft. However, by this time the bishop has left for France with King Edward III. Along the way she witnesses the ravages of the war and acts as a field nurse during the Battle of Crecy, during which Ralph, having fled charges of rape and murder in England, saves the life of the Prince of Wales and is rewarded with his lifelong dream of knighthood. Caris's errand is fruitless, however, as the bishop of Kingsbridge as well as Earl Roland have been killed in the battle. In Florence, the city is ravaged by the Black Death, having arrived in Messina in 1347. After recovering from the plague in the spring of 1348, a newly widowed Merthin experiences an epiphany of his love for Caris and returns to Kingsbridge with his daughter Laura (Lolla). There he finds Caris unwilling to renounce her vows and the two go through a sporadic liaison. At the same time, Merthin re-establishes himself in the community by solving flaws left in the new bridge during its completion after his departure. Thousands of residents of Kingsbridge die in the outbreak of plague, and the city quickly descends into anarchy. Godwyn loses his nerve and flees with the monks to an isolated chapel where he and all the monks die except for Gwenda's brother Philemon, who fled, and Thomas Langley. After the prioress of the nunnery dies Caris is elected Prioress and promoted acting Prior in the absence of Godwin, and she institutes the use of masks and cleanliness which help to protect the nuns from the plague. With social mores loosened under the devastating effect of the plague, Caris regularly breaks her vows as a nun and for some time lives openly with Merthin; the townspeople, grateful for Caris tireless efforts, tolerate this, as does the pragmatic Bishop who himself has a long-standing homosexual relationship with his archdeacon. But the returning Philemon starts denouncing Caris, who must drop Merthin in order to continue her monastic and medical work. The disappointed Merthin angrily tells her he would not wait any more, but would find another love. After William, the new Earl of Shiring, dies from the plague along with all his male heirs, Ralph sees a chance to become Earl. After murdering his young wife Matilda (Tilly) he arranges his marriage to William's widow Lady Phillipa, whom he has long desired, and makes himself Earl. However Philippa spurns him and leaves for the Kingsbridge nunnery, where she and Merthin fall in love in 1350 and she conceives his child. Afraid of Ralph's wrath, Philippa seduces Ralph to make him believe the child is his. As a result, Merthin and Philippa cannot continue their liaison. After two years, the plague dissipates and Caris renounces her vows, after finally being able to run her own independent hospital, and marries Merthin. After ten years of hardship, the people of Kingsbridge are granted a borough charter, freeing them from the lordship of the priory, and Merthin becomes alderman. Merthin also solves the long troublesome problem of why the vault of the cathedral collapsed by dismantling and rebuilding one of the towers which he redesigns to be the tallest building in England.Although Ralph continues to harbour a grudge against Wulfric, he is forced by the labour shortages resulting from the plague to allow Wulfric to regain his father's land. When Sam, the secret son of Ralph, kills the local bailiff's son and is sentenced to death, Gwenda reveals his true parentage to Ralph to gain Sam's release. Armed with this knowledge, Ralph blackmails Gwenda into having sex with him again. When Sam walks in on this, there is struggle in which Sam and Gwenda kill Ralph. Davey, Gwenda's second son, negotiates a free tenancy and marries Amabel, the daughter of Wulfric's former wife-to-be, proving to Gwenda that her life has had some worth. Gwenda's conniving brother Philemon becomes Prior of Kingsbridge and even tries to become Bishop, but his ambition is ruined after Sir Thomas Langley dies of old age. Merthin keeps his promise and digs up the letter which reveals that the deposed King Edward II had secretly survived and had taken the identity of one of his attackers. Merthin trades the letter to a member of the king's court in exchange for Philemon's departure from Kingsbridge forever. As the plague comes back, Caris's intelligence, practical sense and determination allow the townspeople to subdue this second outbreak, making her the most popular and revered figure in Kingsbridge. Merthin completes his spire and succeeds in making Kingsbridge cathedral the tallest building in England. Characters =Major characters= *Merthin: A red- haired descendant of Jack Builder and Lady Aliena, the chief protagonists of The Pillars of the Earth. Variously known as Merthin Fitzgerald, Merthin Builder, and Merthin Bridger, Merthin is the eldest son of the disgraced knight Sir Gerald and Lady Maud. A clever young carpenter, builder, and architect, he uses his intellect to his advantage and has a lifelong love for Caris. He designs a radical new bridge before being forced to renounce Caris. Leaving for Italy, he becomes successful in Florence, where he marries. Several years later, after his wife and her family are wiped out by the plague in Florence, he returns to Kingsbridge with his only daughter, Lolla, and establishes his authority as a master builder.

Since childhood she wants to be a doctor, though only men may be physicians. A determined and bright woman, she refuses to marry to keep her independence, although she and Merthin love each other deeply. Her rising influence in the town and her bid to free the merchants from the control of the priory brings her into conflict with the church, resulting in her being tried for witchcraft. She escapes the death sentence by entering the priory as a nun, thanks to the Prioress, Mother Cecilia. In charge of the hospital, she uses common sense and observation, and opposes the formerly undisputed authority of the monk - physicians. During the outbreaks of plague, Caris enforces hygiene practices to inhibit its spread and writes a catalogue of cures and good practices to avoid the spreading of contagious illnesses, which becomes coveted by pharmacists throughout England. She's elected Prioress of Kingsbridge after the death of Mother Cecilia and is promoted acting Prior when all the monks flee Kingsbridge for fear of the plague.

After she successfully fights the plague a second time, she becomes revered in the whole town. In the TV adaptation she is played by Charlotte Riley. *Godwyn: An older cousin of Caris and monk at the Kingsbridge Priory, Godwyn gives the impression of a reformer as he maneuvers his election as Prior - with the help of his scheming mother, Petranilla.

She becomes estranged from her family when her father sells her to vagabonds for a cow. Though she never escapes poverty and tragedy, she uses her wits to better her situation and escape danger. Though not pretty and is described as \\"rat-like\\", Gwenda is sensual in her appearance and is both desired and despised by Ralph. Gwenda loves Wulfric, despite the fact that he is engaged to Annet and is a lifelong friend to Caris, despite the great difference in their social class.

Merthin completes his promise to dig up the letter and learns that King Edward II was not assassinated, but escaped and is hiding in exile.

She had a soft spot for Godwyn when he was younger, but grows to dislike him and distrust him when he rules that the monks and nuns must be physically separate (causing the nuns to lose significant access to the priory's facilities). Later, she learns further how untrustworthy he is when he steals a large bequest from the nuns' funds to pay for the building of a new Prior's palace. She dies in the first plague outbreak. In the TV adaption she is played by Miranda Richardson. *Elizabeth Clerk; Foil to Caris, bright and educated, beautiful; wants to marry Merthin and nearly seduces him, but is frustrated by Merthin's unrequited obsession with Caris; enters nunnery when Merthin refuses her; politically opposed to Caris in nunnery politics, based on prior grudge. In the TV adaption she is played by Caroline Boulton. *Friar Murdo: A meddlesome, psychotic charlatan who uses zealous piety to satisfy his desire to see women burned as witches. Provides crucial evidence that seems to assure Caris's guilt at her trial for witchcraft. In the TV adaptation he is played by John Rado. *Earl Roland: the earl of Shiring; he and his sons acted as the Queen's henchmen in the assassination attempt of Edward II. In the TV adaptation is played by Peter Firth. *Sir Gerald and Lady Maude. Parents of Merthin and Ralph. Formerly of gentry, owning some villages, they settle to live as pensioners of the monastery.  Reception  Historical references * The reign of King Edward III provides the historical setting for the novel. * The structural problems that force a rebuilding of the tower at Kingsbridge cathedral were modeled after an incident at the old cathedral of the Spanish town of Vitoria-Gasteiz (from the author's Acknowledgements). * Merthin's target in his quest to build the tallest church spire in England was Salisbury Cathedral. * The chapters taking place in France include accurate descriptions of the Battles of Blanchetaque and Crécy. Though the book has no French viewpoint characters, the plot device of Caris along with Sister Mair finding themselves inadvertently among the French soldiers, disguised as boys, makes it possible to describe the battles from both the English and the French points of view. * Although all the action in England occurs in the fictional towns of Kingsbridge and Shiring, actual locales such as Melcombe (depicted as the main port used by the Kingsbridge merchants), Gloucester, Monmouth, Shaftesbury, Exeter, Winchester and Salisbury are in the same vicinity. This places the setting somewhere in south-central England. * The Earls of Monmouth are often referenced as having many dealings (and at least two marriage alliances) with the Earls of Shiring. In historical fact, the title was only created in the 17th Century and there were no such Earls at the time in which World Without End is set. * The mysterious buried letter, whose contents are revealed only near the end of the novel, is similar in many ways to the historical Fieschi Letter. Television adaptation A television adaptation, produced by Scott Free and Tandem Communications, adapted by John Pielmeier, and directed by Michael Caton-Jones was broadcast in the United Kingdom in 2013.

The station is owned by Gold Coast Broadcasting and airs a rhythmic oldies music format. KOCP is partially simulcast on sister station KQIE in Redlands, California, also at 104.7 FM. History =Early years= KOCP was one of the first FM stations to sign on in the Oxnard–Ventura, California radio market, having debuted on September 27, 1958 as KAAR. In 1964, the station changed its call letters to KPMJ and began airing soft rock with the branding . In 1977, Channel Islands Broadcasting Corporation purchased KPMJ; the following year, the station adopted the call sign KACY-FM to match that of its sister station (now KKZZ) and instituted an easy listening format. =Q105 (1983–1996)= In November 1982, Channel Islands Broadcasting sold KACY-AM-FM to Sunbeam Radio Partnership for $2.59 million. Harold A. Frank, vice president and general manager of in Miami, became both a partner in Sunbeam Radio and the new general manager of the Oxnard stations. KACY-FM changed its call letters to KCAQ on February 21, 1983. The new station adopted the branding \\"Q105\\" and aired a mainstream top 40 format. The original Q105 on-air staff included E. Curtis Johnson in mornings, Johnny Dolan in middays, and Brian Thomas in afternoons. Weeknights were hosted by Gwen Johnson and later Famous Amos who was popular with the teenage demographic; Jay Porter hosted late nights. Dolan was selected as KCAQ's first program director; Thomas would replace him only months later. KCAQ was an immediate ratings success, climbing to number one with double-digit ratings in both the Arbitron and Birch ratings reports. In the station's first full year as Q105, as measured by Arbitron, the station garnered a share of 11.0 and captured most key demographic groups including teens, adults 18–34, and women 18–49. In October 1987, Sunbeam Radio Partnership sold KCAQ and its AM sister, then known as KTRO, to Greater Pacific Radio Exchange Ltd., a company owned by Frank, for $4.5 million. As Frank was also the minority partner in Sunbeam Radio at the time, the transaction gave him complete ownership of the station pair. By 1988, KCAQ began evolving towards a \\"crossover\\" format (later known as rhythmic contemporary), a top-40 presentation emphasizing upbeat dance music, filling the void left by competitor KMYX when that station flipped formats to country music the following year. =Q104.7 (1996–2016)= In mid-1996, Greater Pacific Radio Exchange sold KCAQ and KTRO to Gold Coast Broadcasting for $3.65 million. Under the direction of program director Dan Garite, brought over from KOCP (then at 95.9 FM), KCAQ changed its branding to \\"Q104.7\\" and began tightening its rhythmic contemporary format. Garite programmed Q104.7 to compete directly with Los Angeles market stations including KPWR (Power 106), dropping mainstream pop in favor of more R&B;, hip hop, dance, and rhythmic pop selections. Garite's successful campaign to boost KCAQ's ratings in its home market also included hiring local on-air talent, particularly of Latino heritage, and stressing the station's \\"805\\" roots. Two prominent on-air personalities brought on in 1996 as part of Garite's overhaul of KCAQ are Jaime \\"Rico\\" Rangel and Daniel \\"Mambo\\" Herrejon. Initially, the two Latino men from Fillmore and Santa Paula, California, respectively, hosted The Rico and Mambo Show weeknights; the station's Arbitron ratings share for that time slot nearly tripled within a year. Soon, Rico and Mambo began hosting Q104.7's morning show, where they led the station to number one in the Oxnard–Ventura radio market. In 2005, the duo left KCAQ to join rival rhythmic contemporary station KVYB (103.3 The Vibe) where they hosted morning drive until June 13, 2008. After being dismissed from KVYB in 2008, Rangel and Herrejon returned to KCAQ on October 5, 2009. From September 2010 to February 2015, KCAQ was simulcast on sister station KQIE in the Riverside–San Bernardino, California area. That station, like KCAQ, is on the 104.7 FM frequency and was branded as \\"Q104.7\\" but aired advertising and promotions targeted to the Inland Empire audience. KQIE later flipped to rhythmic oldies. =Old School 104.7 (2016–present)= On July 1, 2016 at 7 a.m., KCAQ swapped frequencies with sister station KOCP, moving from 104.7 FM to 95.9 FM. This move brought the KOCP call letters and rhythmic oldies format to 104.7 FM, now rebranded \\"Old School 104.7\\". It also marked the return of the format to the Los Angeles market for the first time due to KHHT's flip to urban contemporary on February 6, 2015. KOCP is partially simulcast in the Inland Empire on sister station KQIE, also at 104.7 FM. On October 6, 2017, KOCP began streaming online. Transmission notes In the San Gabriel Valley, low-power FM station KQEV-LP in Walnut broadcasts on 104.7 FM. Its signal contour is squeezed in between those of KOCP and KQIE, causing a small gap in transmission between both stations.

It was the site of Harbor Hill, a large Long Island mansion built from 1899–1902 in Roslyn, New York, commissioned by Clarence Hungerford Mackay. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White, with Stanford White supervising the project. It was the largest home he ever designed. Stanford White on Long Island; Exhibit at the Museums at Stony Brook to November 1 (Antiques and the Arts Online) History Harbor Hill in 1922 Clarence Mackay (1874–1938) was the son of Comstock Lode magnate John William Mackay, and inherited much of an estimated $500 million fortune upon his father's death in 1902 (approximately $13 billion in 2012 dollars). White collaborated closely with Clarence Mackay's wife, Katharine Duer Mackay (1880–1930), and with her approval, based the main façade of Harbor Hill upon that of François Mansart's Château de Maisons of 1642, using a mix of other influences to finish the overall design. Built at great expense and furnished lavishly (at least three different decorating firms were employed), the home originally sat on and enjoyed views across Roslyn Harbor to Long Island Sound. Formal terraces and gardens were finished by Guy Lowell. Social events held at the house included a grand party for the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII and the Duke of Windsor) in 1924.http://www.mackayhistory.com/HarborHill.html On June 13, 1927, Charles Lindbergh, accompanied by his mother and the Mayor of New York, was Clarence MacKay's guest of honor at a banquet and dance the night of Lindbergh's ticker-tape parade on 5th Avenue.Bill Bryson, \\"One Summer: America, 1927\\" (Doubleday 1913) After Harbor Hill was dynamited in 1947, a fountain with four equestrian statues, designed by Henri-Léon Gréber, was moved to Kansas City, Missouri where it has since been on public display adjacent to the Country Club Plaza. =Summit= Harbor Hill, the site of the former mansion, is the highest point in Nassau County, New York, at 348 feet.USGS GNIS Detail, Harbor Hill Whether Harbor Hill or 401-foot Jayne's Hill to the east was the highest point on Long Island was a point of some debate in the 19th century, with Harbor Hill often thought to be the highest summit.

EMAs or EMTs are developed from averaging the multiple values of the constituents that directly make up the composite material. At the constituent level, the values of the materials vary and are inhomogeneous. Precise calculation of the many constituent values is nearly impossible. However, theories have been developed that can produce acceptable approximations which in turn describe useful parameters and properties of the composite material as a whole. In this sense, effective medium approximations are descriptions of a medium (composite material) based on the properties and the relative fractions of its components and are derived from calculations. Applications There are many different effective medium approximations, each of them being more or less accurate in distinct conditions. Nevertheless, they all assume that the macroscopic system is homogeneous and, typical of all mean field theories, they fail to predict the properties of a multiphase medium close to the percolation threshold due to the absence of long-range correlations or critical fluctuations in the theory. The properties under consideration are usually the conductivity \\\\sigma or the dielectric constant \\\\epsilon of the medium. These parameters are interchangeable in the formulas in a whole range of models due to the wide applicability of the Laplace equation. The problems that fall outside of this class are mainly in the field of elasticity and hydrodynamics, due to the higher order tensorial character of the effective medium constants. EMAs can be discrete models, such as applied to resistor networks, or continuum theories as applied to elasticity or viscosity. However, most of the current theories have difficulty in describing percolating systems. Indeed, among the numerous effective medium approximations, only Bruggeman's symmetrical theory is able to predict a threshold. This characteristic feature of the latter theory puts it in the same category as other mean field theories of critical phenomena.  Bruggeman's model  = Formulas = Without any loss of generality, we shall consider the study of the effective conductivity (which can be either dc or ac) for a system made up of spherical multicomponent inclusions with different arbitrary conductivities. Then the Bruggeman formula takes the form:  Circular and spherical inclusions  \\\\sum_i\\\\,\\\\delta_i\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_i - \\\\sigma_e}{\\\\sigma_i + (n-1) \\\\sigma_e}\\\\,=\\\\,0\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(1) In a system of Euclidean spatial dimension n that has an arbitrary number of components, the sum is made over all the constituents. \\\\delta_i and \\\\sigma_i are respectively the fraction and the conductivity of each component, and \\\\sigma_e is the effective conductivity of the medium. (The sum over the \\\\delta_i's is unity.)  Elliptical and ellipsoidal inclusions  \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\,\\\\delta\\\\alpha+\\\\frac{(1-\\\\delta)(\\\\sigma_m - \\\\sigma_e)}{\\\\sigma_m + (n-1)\\\\sigma_e}\\\\,=\\\\,0\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(2) This is a generalization of Eq. (1) to a biphasic system with ellipsoidal inclusions of conductivity \\\\sigma into a matrix of conductivity \\\\sigma_m. The fraction of inclusions is \\\\delta and the system is n dimensional. For randomly oriented inclusions, \\\\alpha\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sigma - \\\\sigma_e}{\\\\sigma_e + L_j(\\\\sigma - \\\\sigma_e)}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(3) where the L_j's denote the appropriate doublet/triplet of depolarization factors which is governed by the ratios between the axis of the ellipse/ellipsoid. For example: in the case of a circle {L_1=1/2, L_2=1/2} and in the case of a sphere {L_1=1/3, L_2=1/3, L_3=1/3}. (The sum over the L_j 's is unity.) The most general case to which the Bruggeman approach has been applied involves bianisotropic ellipsoidal inclusions. = Derivation = The figure illustrates a two-component medium. Consider the cross-hatched volume of conductivity \\\\sigma_1, take it as a sphere of volume V and assume it is embedded in a uniform medium with an effective conductivity \\\\sigma_e. If the electric field far from the inclusion is \\\\overline{E_0} then elementary considerations lead to a dipole moment associated with the volume \\\\overline{p}\\\\, \\\\propto \\\\,V\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_1 - \\\\sigma_e}{\\\\sigma_1 + 2\\\\sigma_e}\\\\,\\\\overline{E_0}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(4)\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,. This polarization produces a deviation from \\\\overline{E_0}. If the average deviation is to vanish, the total polarization summed over the two types of inclusion must vanish. Thus \\\\delta_1\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_1 - \\\\sigma_e}{\\\\sigma_1 + 2\\\\sigma_e}\\\\,+\\\\,\\\\delta_2\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_2 - \\\\sigma_e}{\\\\sigma_2 + 2\\\\sigma_e}\\\\,=\\\\,0\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(5) where \\\\delta_1 and \\\\delta_2 are respectively the volume fraction of material 1 and 2. This can be easily extended to a system of dimension n that has an arbitrary number of components. All cases can be combined to yield Eq. (1). Eq. (1) can also be obtained by requiring the deviation in current to vanish . It has been derived here from the assumption that the inclusions are spherical and it can be modified for shapes with other depolarization factors; leading to Eq. (2). A more general derivation applicable to bianisotropic materials is also available. = Modeling of percolating systems = The main approximation is that all the domains are located in an equivalent mean field. Unfortunately, it is not the case close to the percolation threshold where the system is governed by the largest cluster of conductors, which is a fractal, and long- range correlations that are totally absent from Bruggeman's simple formula. The threshold values are in general not correctly predicted. It is 33% in the EMA, in three dimensions, far from the 16% expected from percolation theory and observed in experiments. However, in two dimensions, the EMA gives a threshold of 50% and has been proven to model percolation relatively well.  Maxwell Garnett equation  In the Maxwell Garnett approximation, the effective medium consists of a matrix medium with \\\\varepsilon_m and inclusions with \\\\varepsilon_i. = Formula = The Maxwell Garnett equation reads: :\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff}-\\\\varepsilon_m}{\\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff}+2\\\\varepsilon_m} \\\\right) =\\\\delta_i \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\varepsilon_m}{\\\\varepsilon_i+2\\\\varepsilon_m}\\\\right),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(6) where \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff} is the effective dielectric constant of the medium, \\\\varepsilon_i of the inclusions, and \\\\varepsilon_m of the matrix; \\\\delta_i is the volume fraction of the inclusions. The Maxwell Garnett equation is solved by: :\\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff}\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\varepsilon_m\\\\,\\\\frac{2\\\\delta_i(\\\\varepsilon_i - \\\\varepsilon_m) + \\\\varepsilon_i + 2\\\\varepsilon_m}{2\\\\varepsilon_m + \\\\varepsilon_i - \\\\delta_i(\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\varepsilon_m)},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(7)Levy, O., & Stroud, D.

By using the Lorentz local field concept, we obtain the Clausius-Mossotti relation: :\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon-1}{\\\\varepsilon+2}= \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{3} \\\\sum_j N_j \\\\alpha_j Where N_j is the number of particles per unit volume. By using elementary electrostatics, we get for a spherical inclusion with dielectric constant \\\\varepsilon_i and a radius a a polarisability \\\\alpha: : \\\\alpha = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_i-1}{\\\\varepsilon_i+2} \\\\right) a^{3} If we combine \\\\alpha with the Clausius Mosotti equation, we get: : \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff}-1}{\\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff}+2} \\\\right) = \\\\delta_i \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_i-1}{\\\\varepsilon_i+2} \\\\right) Where \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff} is the effective dielectric constant of the medium, \\\\varepsilon_i of the inclusions; \\\\delta_i is the volume fraction of the inclusions. As the model of Maxwell Garnett is a composition of a matrix medium with inclusions we enhance the equation: :\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff}-\\\\varepsilon_m}{\\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{eff}+2\\\\varepsilon_m} \\\\right) =\\\\delta_i \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\varepsilon_m}{\\\\varepsilon_i+2\\\\varepsilon_m}\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(8) = Validity = In general terms, the Maxwell Garnett EMA is expected to be valid at low volume fractions \\\\delta_i , since it is assumed that the domains are spatially separated and electrostatic interaction between the chosen inclusions and all other neighbouring inclusions is neglected. The Maxwell Garnett formula, in contrast to Bruggeman formula, ceases to be correct when the inclusions become resonant. In the case of plasmon resonance, the Maxwell Garnett formula is correct only at volume fraction of the inclusions \\\\delta_i < 10 ^{-5}. The applicability of effective medium approximation for dielectric multilayers and metal-dielectric multilayers have been studied, showing that there are certain cases where the effective medium approximation does not hold and one needs to be cautious in application of the theory. Effective medium theory for resistor networks For a network consisting of a high density of random resistors, an exact solution for each individual element may be impractical or impossible. In such case, a random resistor network can be considered as a two-dimensional graph and the effective resistance can be modelled in terms of graph measures and geometrical properties of networks. Assuming, edge length << electrode spacing and edges to be uniformly distributed, the potential can be considered to drop uniformly from one electrode to another. Sheet resistance of such a random network (R_{sn}) can be written in terms of edge (wire) density (N_E), resistivity (\\\\rho), width (w) and thickness (t) of edges (wires) as: R_{sn}\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{w\\\\,t\\\\,\\\\sqrt{N_E}}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(9) See also * Constitutive equation * Percolation threshold References Further reading  * Condensed matter physics Physical chemistry ","title":"Effective medium approximations"},{"id":"9683146","text":"Lanka is the name given in Hindu epics to the island fortress capital of the legendary demon king Ravana.

The facility was named after Taytay native Cesar Lim Rodriguez, a former judge who donated part of his property for the airport. The airport is owned by the Province of Palawan. Recent interest in improving the infrastructure in this airport is due to its strategic location in the northern part of the Palawan mainland: the renowned beach resorts of the area (including El Nido and Apulit Island) and the historic town of Taytay are only 30 to 40 kilometers by road from the airport. In comparison, the only other airport capable of handling large aircraft is located in the provincial capital of Puerto Princesa, approximately 230 kilometers to the south. In 2013 the Department of Transportation and Communications approved a 48.2-million budget for the airport's improvement, consisting of the concreting of a runway 1,100 meters long and 18 meters wide. In February 2016 the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Palawan approved a resolution to permit the semi-privatization of the airport through a public–private partnership (PPP).

It serves as trade and commerce hub for nearby area Udali, Nokhuti, Laskar Pather, Karikhana, Kheroni, Dablong. Etymology Lanka name is probably given after the name Lanka of Ramayana. Assamese poet Madhava Kandali was said to be inhabitant of Lanka saka 1274 / 1352 A.D, who wrote Saptakanda Ramayana, under the patronage of Varāha-Rājā Mahamanikya. Geography Lanka town of Hojai District, Assam is located about 11 km from the district headquarter Sankar Dev Nagar. Demographics India census, Lanka is a Municipal Board having 11 Wards. Lanka had a population of 36,805. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Lanka has an average literacy rate of 86.85%, higher than the national average of 72.19%: male literacy is 91.20%, and female literacy is 82.28%. Connectivity Lanka town is connected by the erstwhile National Highway 54 connecting nearby Dabaka (25 km.)with Silchar (305 km. This highway is now numbered as NH-27, an east–west corridor connecting Porbander in Gujarat to Silchar in Assam. The highway is being developed as a four-lane highway by National Highways Authority of India. Lanka is also served by a railway line which Guwahati - Lumding BG line connecting to all parts of Assam and also to Delhi, Howrah etc. The town is about 150 km by rail and 185 km. by road from Guwahati. History The name ‘Dabak’ is a derivative of the Sanskrit word ‘Devark’ According to Historian Rajmohan Nath, In olden times, times there was scarcity of water, and the by the regional language Lang Kha means the same, hence the name of the place came into being. During that time the place was a barren land. During the British Invasions water was brought by wagons and this place was also made the base camps. It was only after the 1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake that the water level raised again. Rangmahala, a place in the outskirts of Lanka had the King's Amusement palace or Rangmahal. After the rulers abandoned Lanka, Khasi- Jayantiya started to rule. When King Viswasundar was the ruler of DABAK, Lanka was an independent state. An inscription of the 13th century discovered near Dabaka, has the following lines about Lanka: “ Kachhar rajyad jayantay lankanta rajyabanta Yajnamenong daabeka mandali mathastha karyamasa” The Lankeswari Temple is of historical significance for the place. Its very much Linked to the Heart and culture of Lanka\` In the earlier times, the year 1505 to be precise, the first prophet of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev had visited Kamrup, Assam. This fact is recorded in the documents concerning the numerous journeys undertaken by Guru Nanak in various stages of his life. It is said that, he had Srimanta Shankardeva, the founder of the Mahapuruxiya Dharma as the Guru traveled from Dhaka to Assam. After this journey by the first Guru, Ninth Guru or prophet of Sikhs Guru Tegh Bahadur also visited Assam in 1668. This was the time when armies of Aurangzeb tried the best to cross the Brahamputra river and enter the Assam. They were thoroughly routed by the Ahom general Lachit Borphukan. Guru visited the place called Dhubri. A famous for the Sikh Gurudwara was constructed to commemorate his visit. Every year Sikhs from all over India and foreign visit this holy place. The grateful Ahom King invited Guruji to the Kamakhya shrine, where he was honoured. While some died and some came back to Punjab, a few stayed on and made Assam their home, raising families. Their descendants today —mostly concentrated in Nagaon district — are Assamese for all practical purposes, and none speaks Punjabi, but continue to maintain their Sikh identity and observe most tenets and traditions of the religion.

Following the closure of the sugar mills, the town was hit with a large unemployment dilemma. Many employment programmes were started by the government.

Residential and industrial development in the former suburban cities of York and North York have obliterated nearly all traces of its original course and topography in the uppermost reaches, but the original stream valley is evident in several older districts bordering the lower reaches. Sections of the lower valley include Cedarvale Park ravine, the Nordheimer Ravine near the intersection of St. Clair Avenue and Spadina Road, and the Rosedale Ravine just above the brook's confluence with the Don. Water still runs in short segments in Cedarvale Park and the Nordheimer Ravine but this is only a collection of surface runoff and ravine slope seepage. The channels are all artificially created and run into a storm sewer that carries the remnants of the brook. The southern section of Vaughan Road roughly parallels the brook's course, bypassing the steep slopes of the Cedarvale ravine. The brook's topographic influence is still evident at Ramsden Park, to the north of the intersection of Avenue Road and Davenport Road, representing the boundary of the densely developed Yorkville district. The Toronto Transit Commission's Spadina subway line follows the path of the creek from Eglinton West station to St. Clair West station, finally deviating southward at Spadina Road. The brook is named for the summer residence of Ontario's first colonial governor, John Graves Simcoe, which in turn was named for Simcoe's son, Francis Gwillim. It was built either on the west side of the Don River near the modern Prince Edward (Bloor) Viaduct, or on the east side of Cabbagetown near the river. The home featured a façade in the Georgian architectural style. It was abandoned when Simcoe returned to England in 1794, and burned down in 1829. Castle Frank subway station takes its name from the former residence. A second home of the same name was built north of this site by Sir Edward Kemp. It was demolished in 1962 for the current Rosedale Heights School of the Arts. The site of the original summer home can be seen from aerial photos as a partially cleared area with a ring-like shape.

In 1985 he told Playbill, “Nine years ago, [gay] playwrights and actors didn’t use their own names; a gay play meant something pornographic. I thought by using my own name, it would be a forerunner — it would force others to do the same.” When “Torch Song” won Best Play just two years after public health recognition of the AIDS crisis, Glines said on the national telecast, “This is a stupendous and miraculous moment, and I would like to accept this in memory of Jane Chambers and Billy Blackwell and in honor of all my brothers and sisters.” After thanking Fierstein and others in the company, Glines concluded, “And lastly but most importantly to the one person who believed and followed the dream from the very beginning who never said, ‘You’re crazy and it can’t be done,’ I refer to my partner and my lover, Lawrence Lane.” Writing last year in The New York Times, Stuart Emmrich said he and his partner, Barry, “were shocked. It was the first time either of us had seen a real-life gay man openly acknowledge a romantic relationship on network TV, much less on an awards program.” The Times did not cover Glines’ historic speech in its next day coverage, but did quote Natalia Makarova who won for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical for “On Your Toes” thanking her husband “who didn’t help much but wasn’t in the way.” And the newspaper noted that Tommy Tune, who won two Tonys for “On Your Toes,” wore “a bright pink shirt and pink bow tie” and thanked his sister.

R. Gurney. It was first produced Off-Broadway at the Studio Theatre of Playwrights Horizons, in 1981. Synopsis The play is a comedy of manners, set in a single dining room where 18 scenes from different households overlap and intertwine. Presumably, each story is focused around a different family during different time periods who has in their possession the same dining room furniture set, manufactured in 1898. The stories are about White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) families. Some scenes are about the furniture itself and the emotional attachment to it, while other scenes simply flesh out the culture of the WASPs. Overall, it tells the story of the dying and relatively short-lived culture of upper-middle class Americans, and the transition into a much more efficient society with less emphasis on tradition and more emphasis on progress. Some characters are made fun of, as is the culture itself, but there is also a genuine longing for the sense of stability, comfort and togetherness that the culture provides. From the back of the playbook: > The play is set in the dining room of a typical well-to-do household, the > place where the family assembled daily for breakfast and dinner and for any > and all special occasions. The action is a mosaic of interrelated > scenes—some funny, some touching, some rueful—which, taken together, create > an in-depth portrait of a vanishing species: the upper-middle-class WASP. > The actors change roles, personalities and ages with virtuoso skill as they > portray a wide variety of characters, from little boys to stern > grandfathers, and from giggling teenage girls to Irish housemaids. Each > vignette introduces a new set of people and events; a father lectures his > son on grammar and politics; a boy returns from boarding school to discover > his mother's infidelity; a senile grandmother doesn't recognize her own sons > at Thanksgiving dinner; a daughter, her marriage a shambles, pleads futilely > to return home, etc. Dovetailing swiftly and smoothly, the varied scenes > coalesce, ultimately, into a theatrical experience of exceptional range, > compassionate humor and abundant humanity.

Its name for the first few years was New River City and then was changed to Denny from A.H. Denny who maintained a store there as well as other stores over the ridges in Siskiyou County. (Denny never lived at the place that adopted his name, however.) As time went on the gold profits went down, people were leaving to find other places to live, and by 1920 brothers Grover and Willard Ladd began homesteading a 160-acre ranch where the new Denny would be located, twenty miles down the trail. In 1921 their parents, Frank and Nellie Ladd, left Old Denny and moved down with their sons, bringing with them the Denny Post Office, and so soon the new location adopted that name, as well. Old Denny was abandoned with no buildings standing now. This \\"new\\" Denny site, a large flat situated on a bench alongside the New River, was first occupied by placer gold miners in the mid-1850s soon after gold was discovered in the New River. General James W. Denver, from whom later the Colorado city was named, was one of the men instrumental in discovering this new source of gold, when he sent a group of men up in this direction, in1851.Letter from General James W. Denver to Rohnerville, CA, Herald, December 19, 1891; George C. Burns, Denver, the Man, published by author, 1949 Cyrus Quimby and his brother-in-law, Robert L. Thomas, moved onto the large flat (also called \\"Big Flat\\" during its first years) in the mid-1850s, began farming and established a business called the Thomas-Quimby Trading Post (according to Trinity County official tax records for the late 1850s). Thomas and Quimby married Chimariko Indian sisters who had been raised along the Trinity River at Cedar Flat.Quimby and Thomas marriage records on file at Trinity County Courthouse, Weaverville, CA The location became known as the town of Quimby, and the creek about a mile upstream from which the ranch obtained water, was also named after Cyrus Quimby. The town had a post office and was also a place for local voters to cast ballots at election time. For a few years around 1907 the site was called Burris from Frank Burris who was the post master, ran the store, and mined—part of the time at the Beartooth Mine, a gold and copper hard rock mine across the New River from Denny. The ranch was farmed and the store or trading post was continued by different people through the years until Grover and Willard Ladd took over the land with the intention of homesteading, as already mentioned above, in 1920. Denny made occasional national news from the 1970s through the first years of the 1980s when there was in influx of new people who came to the area to live on mining claims. The mining claims are part of the National Forest system of public lands and the local U.S. Forest Service was responsible, in coordination with the Bureau of Land Management, for handling a situation where there were many illegal residences on the claims. The Mining Law of 1872 had allowed miners to live on their claims, but later legislation, including the Surface Rights Act of 1955, revised this, stipulating that a claim would have to actually support the claimants—not just be a place on which to live. It was a complicated situation which brought about controversial and sometimes angered incidents, including the burning of two Forest Service buildings by arson and, in April 1971 a Forest Service official was injured in the neck by a ricochet bullet during a mineral examination at one of the problem mining claims. Someone from the other side of the New River was shooting toward a group of people associated with the event.Trinity Journal, Weaverville, CA, April 22, 1971; Klam-Ity Kourier, Willow Creek, CA, April 28, 1971 A store was operated full time at Denny until the early 1970s, then intermittently for a few years, and then not at all. There is no store there now, although the little log structure still stands on the side of the road for passersby to view as they drive by. The road to Denny from Highway 299 West at Hawkins Bar is only about 19 miles but takes close to an hour to drive due to the number of curves and steep terrain. Denny is the gateway to the western portion of the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area.

It was once owned by Oliver Hudson Kelley, one of the founders of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry. The farmstead is a U.S. National Historic Landmark, which also places it on the National Register of Historic Places. The farm is currently operated as a historic site by the Minnesota Historical Society. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. History Oliver Kelley moved to Minnesota in 1849, the year that Minnesota Territory was formed. Although he knew little about farming, he taught himself using agricultural journals and correspondence with other \\"scientific-oriented\\" farmers. He became an expert on farming in Minnesota, and he learned how adverse events such as bad weather, debt, insect pests, and crop failures could devastate a farmer's fortunes. In 1864, he became a clerk in the United States Department of Agriculture. After the end of the American Civil War, he toured the agricultural resources of the Southern states. When he returned to Washington, he was convinced that farmers' fortunes could be improved through cooperative associations with other farmers. Along with several other associates, he founded the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry in 1867. He later returned to Minnesota with the hope of organizing local Granges. and The farm remained in the ownership of the Kelley family until 1901. The National Grange bought the farm in 1935 and donated it to the Minnesota Historical Society in 1961. Today, the farm offers tours by guides in period costume, who invite visitors to help out with farm chores such as picking vegetables, churning butter, and making soap. In 2003, state budget shortfalls threatened closure for the historical site. In response, the group Friends of the Kelley Farm was organized to help raise money to close the funding gap. The Friends group also supports the educational goals of the site and works for the site's preservation. In 2017, the Minnesota Historical Society opened a new visitor center and modern Farm Lab area with a barn, garden and cropland. These new facilities in combination with Kelley's historic 1860s farmstead allow the historic site to explore agricultural history from the 1860s through modern day.http://www.mnhs.org/media/news/7682 See also *Open-air museum *List of National Historic Landmarks in Minnesota *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sherburne County, Minnesota References External links * Minnesota Historical Society: Oliver H.

Epistemic means 'of, or relating to knowledge'. An epistemic commitment of some kind, on the part of the participants, underlies most arguments. For instance, each participant in an argument would have a position that they are expressing, and an underlying epistemic commitment fundamental to their reasoning. Example Joe states that whales are gentle creatures, and as such, should never be killed. Susan replies that killer whales are not 'gentle', in fact, they eat seal pups. Joe, instead of revising his earlier stated opinion of whales based on new information from Susan, asserts that killer whales must not actually be whales, because a 'true whale eats plankton.' Joe has now redefined 'whale' to suit his argument. If Susan shows Joe a biology textbook which asserts that killer whales are, in fact whales, then Joe might (or might not) decide to withdraw his epistemic commitment to the original statement about whales.

Four expeditions occurred from April to August 1923, and a fifth in July 1924. Led by Lieutenant Commander Samuel Wilder King on the minesweeper , and Alexander Wetmore directing the team of scientists, the expedition studied the plantChristophersen & Caum 1931 animal life, and geology of the central Pacific islands. Noted members of the team include archaeologist Kenneth Emory and herpetologist Chapman Grant. The expedition began with the goal of exterminating domestic rabbits that had been introduced to Laysan island by the guano industry in 1902. Since that time, the rabbits had devoured Laysan's vegetation and led to the extinction of several endemic species. The rabbits were eventually eliminated on Laysan, and the crew witnessed the extinction of the Laysan honeycreeper (apapane). Throughout the expedition, new species were discovered and named, and unique specimens were captured and returned to laboratories for further study. Over 100 archaeological sites were found, including ancient religious sites and prehistoric settlements on Nihoa and Necker Island. First expedition The first expedition departed Honolulu on April 4, 1923 and returned on May 4.Thrum 1923, p.92 The team visited the island of Laysan, Pearl and Hermes Atoll, Midway Atoll, and Kure Atoll. When they spent a month on Laysan studying the endemic Laysan honeycreeper, a violent and sudden storm ravaged the island. After the storm, the crew concluded that the last three specimens of the honeycreeper had been killed. Laysan island =Crew= *Alexander Wetmore (assistant biologist) *Stanley C. Ball (biologist) *J.

The first team left on the Whippoorwill (AM-35), which made the first survey of Johnston Island in the 20th century. Aerial survey and mapping flights over Johnston were conducted with a Douglas DT-2 floatplane carried on her fantail, which was hoisted into the water for take off. Two destroyer convoys accompanied the expedition from Honolulu. The Tanager (AM-5) left Honolulu on July 16 and joined up with the Whippoorwill to complete the survey. From July 27 to August 5, the expedition surveyed Wake Island and named its islets: The southwest islet was named after Charles Wilkes who had led the United States Exploring Expedition in 1841 and determined the location of Wake Island.

Although the bones were owned by the USFWS, the Bishop Museum acted as custodian.Rauzon 2001, pp.44-51 The bones were finally released to the group, and in November, 1997, Hui Mālama chartered a yacht and travelled to Nihoa and Necker to rebury the remains.Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources 2008, p.12 Notes References     Further reading  External links ;NWHI Searchable Online Cultural Collection Database at the Bishop Museum *Tanager Expedition C, 1923, 148 items *Tanager Expedition E, 1924, 122 items Natural history of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands 1923 in science 1924 in science 1923 in the United States 1924 in the United States History of science and technology in the United States United States Navy in the 20th century Military expeditions of the United States 1923 in Hawaii 1924 in Hawaii ","title":"Tanager Expedition"},{"id":"9683674","text":"Hillsborough Street Hillsborough Street is a business and cultural thoroughfare through Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. The street serves as a center for social life among North Carolina State University and Meredith College students. Bars, restaurants, coffee shops, convenience stores and banks are located along a strip of Hillsborough Street that borders the university. The road is also a busy transport corridor, linking the town of Cary with downtown Raleigh. Additionally, the road passes by the North Carolina State Veterinarian School, North Carolina State University Centennial Biomedical Campus, the North Carolina State Fairgrounds, Sacred Heart Church, and Raleigh's Pullen Park. Hillsborough Street in Raleigh  Geography and history  The Hillsborough Street is one of the four streets that radiate outward in the cardinal directions from Capital Square, each leading to one of the former State Capital cities. A modern alternate route to Hillsborough Street in Raleigh is Western Boulevard, which parallels the street to the south. Wade Avenue is an alternate route to Hillsborough Street to the north. Hillsborough Street terminates in the east at the North Carolina State Capitol at Salisbury Street. The street's western terminus is at the Cary town limits, where the roadway continues as East Chatham Street after crossing Interstate 40. North Carolina Highway 54 begins on Hillsborough Street at the Interstate 440 Beltline interchange and travels west for one mile (1.6 km) before forking onto Chapel Hill Road. NCSU's Bell Tower is visible at the street's intersection with Pullen Road. Hillsborough Street takes its name from the city Hillsborough, a former capital city of North Carolina. Like many downtown Raleigh streets, the street's name is derived from a city of the same name in the state; though, initially the street was named Hillsboro Road and was a country road many people used to drive to Hillsborough. The street was first constructed in 1792 as part of the capital city's initial layout.City of Raleigh - Hillsborough Street Redesign The land comprising Hillsborough Street was once the site of the plantation of David Cameron. Cameron established St. Mary's College on Hillsborough Street; the school later became a private girls' school, St. Mary's School. A streetcar traversing Hillsborough Street connected North Carolina State University to Raleigh shortly after the college was built. The street was the site of North Carolina's largest anti-Vietnam War marches, with 10,000 people, including UNC and Duke students, protesting the war. Places of worship Hillsborough Street historic churches include: * Sacred Heart Church * Pullen Memorial Baptist Church * Hillyer Memorial Christian Church * Free Church of the Good Shepherd  Special events  = Basketball and football victories = Following every football and basketball win the NCSU Bell Tower is illuminated red and students are encouraged to \\"Storm the Bell Tower\\" and show their WolfPack pride. After the NC State men's basketball team won the national championship in 1983, students converged on Hillsborough Street to celebrate, with at least one injury to a police officer. Subsequently, the police department cracked down on problem bars on Hillsborough Street, which resulted in many bar closures. The closures included seven bars located at Hillsborough Square. = Paint the Town Red and NCSU Homecoming = As part of NCSU's homecoming week since 2006, many businesses along Hillsborough Street agree to have groups of NCSU students paint their windows red, the main athletic color of the NC State Wolfpack. The spectacle was deemed \\"Paint the Town Red\\". Each year, alumni, students, faculty and staff as well as Wolfpack faithful fill the NC State Campus and surrounding areas painting the town red. Onlookers congregate on Hillsborough Street for the annual Homecoming Parade and watch as dozens of school floats make their way towards the Bell Tower. = WRAL-TV Raleigh Christmas Parade = A Christmas parade is held along Hillsborough Street among other Raleigh streets every November. The event, sponsored by WRAL-TV attracts Raleighites, NCSU students, and visitors.WRAL-TV Raleigh Christmas Parade 2005 = Krispy Kreme Challenge = The Krispy Kreme Challenge, a race invented and organized by NC State Park Scholars with a majority of runners attending NC State, is a new NC State tradition which attracted over 7,500 runners in 2010. Part of Hillsborough Street is closed in order for runners to make their way from the NC State Bell Tower to the Krispy Kreme on Peace Street. The objective is to run to the Krispy Kreme, eat one dozen doughnuts, and run back to the Bell Tower in under one hour. The event raises money to support the North Carolina Children's Hospital, and in 2010 raised $122 million. = City of Oaks Marathon = The Raleigh City of Oaks Marathon and Rex Healthcare Half Marathon annually attracts thousands of athletes to the capital city. The course is revered for the diversity of the landscape, showcasing the Triangle’s natural areas and the capital’s history. = Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure = The Komen NC Triangle Race for the Cure, hosted at Meredith College, raises funds and awareness for the fight against breast cancer, celebrates breast cancer survivorship, and honors those who have lost their battle with the disease. All net funds from the Komen Race for the Cure go to research, education, screening and treatment programs. = 9/11 Memorial Service = On the tenth anniversary of September 11, 2001 NC State Chancellor Randy Woodson lead the campus and community in a memorial service at the Bell Tower honoring all those who perished in the events of 9/11. The service paid tribute to all NCSU alumni who have served in the military. To coincide with this event, the Hillsborough Street Community Service Corporation enlisted the help of over 35 NCSU student groups and organizations to decorate the store- fronts on Hillsborough Street with patriotic imagery. These groups volunteered their time to show their support for, and appreciation of, all the first responders and citizens who lost their lives on that day in 2001. They also thanked all the troops who have served and continue to serve the USA in the armed services. = Art to Wear = Art to Wear is an annual fashion show featuring the creations of NC State students. The NCSU College of Design and College of Textiles team together to showcase the young talent that can be found at NC State as well as its connectivity to the clothing design merchants found around Raleigh, NC. The event is normally followed by an after event which fills the local establishments with customers long into the night.  Notable businesses  One notable business on Hillsborough Street is Players' Retreat, a saloon that opened more than 50 years ago. The bar encompasses a former restaurant, the Morning Room, which served as the unofficial headquarters of Hargrove Bowles' 1972 gubernatorial campaign against Jim Holshauser. It was also a hangout of the Wolfpack basketball players, of Norman Sloan, in the 1970s. Mitch's Tavern was used for scenes in the film Bull Durham in the 1980s. The publishing company Lulu is headquartered on Hillsborough Street.  Education institutions  There are four major education institutions located on Hillsborough Street. The first, and largest, of these is North Carolina State University, with over 34,000 students, and 6,000 faculty and staff. Meredith College is located on the street, with approximately 2,200 female students and 138 faculty members, Meredith College has grown to become one of the largest independent private women’s college in the United States. The third education institution is the all-girls boarding and day school St. Mary’s School for grades 9-12. Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law of Campbell University lies near the eastern terminus of the street.  Hillsborough Street Community Service Corporation  The Hillsborough Street Community Service Corporation is an independent, not for profit, business improvement district created by a partnership between the City of Raleigh, NC State University and the property owners and businesses on Hillsborough Street in the fall of 2009. The HSCSC territory is about 2.5 miles long running on both sides of Hillsborough Street from St. Mary’s School to the beltline (including Morgan St. and a few side streets) and includes a collection of businesses, organizations, institutions and residential options.

It is approximately north of the centre of Cairns, and is the third beach suburb after Machans Beach and Holloways Beach.  Geography  Looking north along the Esplanade towards the \\"knob\\", Yorks Knob, 2018 Yorkeys Knob is a coastal suburb with predominantly low-lying land (less than 10 metres above sea level) with the exception of the hill (known as Yorkeys Knob) rising to 60 metres on the coast at Yorkeys Point. The northern part of the suburb near the coast is residential, but the majority of the land use is rural, mainly used for growing sugarcane. There is a long, sandy beach along the Coral Sea. Fields of sugarcane, Walker Road, 2018 Office of the Ponderosa FinFish farm, Walker Road, 2018 The Finfish Group operate a 17 hectare pond farm (called Ponderosa) which is capable of producing 350 tonnes of fish per annum. They principally raise giant grouper fish as they are fast growing with a high commercial value. The suburb is bounded by the Coral Sea to the north, Thomatis Creek to the east, Captain Cook Highway to the south, and Half Moon Creek to the north-west. History Yorkeys Knob is situated in the Djabugay (Tjapukai) traditional Aboriginal country. Yorkeys Knob got its name from George Lawson, a Yorkshire-born, Cairns-based beche-de-mer fisherman. (From the nickname Yorkey, and the Hill being the “Knob”.) On 10 June 1886 Yorkey Lawson reported the loss of a man and his wife from Green Island. They had left to visit the wreck of the Upolu, intending to return the same day. Lawson made a search for them, but was unable to find any trace of them, not even an accident. The pilot cutter was sent to search for the couple.The Cairns Post, 10 June 1886 Lawson built a homestead adjoining the Mount Buchan estate near what is now Yorkeys Knob. During the off-fishing season he and his sons farmed pumpkins, sweet potatoes and paddy melons, but not successfully. Whatever the bandicoots and pigs didn't eat, the crocodiles did. Lawson used the mangroves near his homestead for the firewood and water needed for his beche-de-mer smoking station on Green Island. Locals are attached to the name, despite the reaction it sometimes gets (\\"knob\\" being a slang term for penis), and successfully prevented a developer from advertising a development as being at \\"Yorkeys Beach\\". At the , the population of Yorkeys Knob was 2,766. Facilities Yorkeys Knob has a supermarket, post office, bottleshop, bakery, and a variety of other shops. A newsagent and a small store are on the beachfront, near the main swimming area. Yorkeys Knob has three restaurants. One at the Half Moon Bay marina has an over-the-water deck looking across Half Moon Bay to Double Island and Haycock Island (also known as Scout's Hat due to its shape). Recreation Warning sign about swimming risks, 2018 The swimming area is at the northern end of Sims Esplanade. It is patrolled for six months of the year by Surf Lifesaving Queensland, and has a stinger net to protect swimmers from box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri). The safest swimming is between the flags placed by the lifesavers; there have been drownings around the rocks a short distance away. There are barbecue and picnic facilities, plus public toilets and showers. The beach is lined with she-oak casuarinas, beach almonds, ballnuts and coconut palms. At its southern end the beach meets Thomatis Creek, which lies between Yorkeys Knob and Holloways Beach.Free public barbeque at the foreshore park, 2018The beach is a popular for kitesurfing and windsurfing. 9th hole, Half Moon Bay Golf ClubHalf Moon Bay Golf Club is located at the western end of Wattle Street, and is a short but challenging layout which features a number of water hazards. It is 5,129 metres long and par is 70. Most of the course is sand-based, and it dries rapidly after heavy rains. A nine-hole course is generally open even if all the other Cairns courses are closed due to flooding, although cyclones can force its closure for a couple of days. Wildlife Kookaburra in a tree on the foreshore, 2018 The golf club is a very good bird-watching location, with masked lapwings, bush stone-curlews, a range of kingfishers, rainbow lorikeets and sea eagles fairly easy to find. Between the 12th and 13th holes lies Ray Howarth Park, which is home to a huge colony of flying foxes, which you can see heading out searching for food in the early evenings. During the day they hang upside down from the mangrove's trees, and make an almighty din. When the melaleucas are in flower you will find them gorging on nectar in the trees at the northern end of Sim's Esplanade. A small bush track near the State school offers a chance to see a variety of birdlife, monitor lizards, and many skinks. Along the beach you will find pied oyster catchers, bush stone- curlews, ghost fiddler crabs and sand-bubbler crabs. At the rocks at the end of the beach keep an eye out of the beach tree skink scampering around the rocks looking for lunch, while you also watching for a pod of bottlenose dolphins that sometimes visit the small bay on the northern side of the groyne.

The neighboring communities include: Maquon, Fairview, London Mills, Ellisville, and Rapatee. Location Built in its current location, 35265 North IL Route 97, in 1973, the district has been around as early as 1949. The first school was located in Fairview. Spoon River Valley High School is located north of Fairview, Illinois, east of London Mills and south of Maquon. It is nestled neatly at the southeast junction of Illinois Route 97 and Illinois Route 116.

Their combined name and mascot is the North Fulton Wildcats, with colors of red and black. The school has no state championships on record in team athletics and activities. The varsity football team, the North Fulton Wildcats, qualified for state tournament in 2007 and 2008, and reached the semi-finals in 2007. History The history of Spoon River Valley High School is also the history of its component schools: Ellisville High School, Fairview High School, London Mills High School, and Maquon High School. SRVHS formed in 1948 when the Ellisville, Fairview, and London Mills schools consolidated, and Maquon joined in 1949 after a year consolidated with Knoxville High School. The high school was first located in Fairview, but later moved to a centralized rural setting east of London Mills when a new school building complex was completed in 1973. =Ellisville High School= The Pleasant Hill Academy is the first recorded school in Ellisville, Illinois. It opened in 1840. A community high school was later established in 1920 and served at the high school until the 1948 consolidation. The Ellisville high school mascot was the Eagles, with school colors of blue and silver. The combined Ellisville High School and Elementy School building continued to serve as a junior high and elementary school in the district until 1973, when a new school complex was built east of London Mills along Illinois Route 116 just south of the village of Raptee which serves all grades, K-12, in the district. The Ellisville school building was razed in the late 1980s. =Fairview High School= School are recorded in Fairview, Illinois as early as 1839, and a school named the Fairview Academy was established in 1863. A formal three year high school curriculum is known to have existed since 1897, and Fairview's first graduating class occurred in 1900. The four year curriculum was not adopted until 1908. The year 1900 also marked the completion of the village's new school building. Fairview High School's mascot was the Foxes, with school colors of orange and black. After outgrowing the 1900 building a parcel of land was purchased and new high school building was opened in the fall of 1922. When the consolidation of area schools occurred in 1948 Fairview High School was chosen to be the site of the consolidated Spoon River Valley High School. The building served as Spoon River Valley High School, sometimes called Valley High School, until 1973 when a modern and centralized school complex was completed east of London Mills. The 1922 Fairview High School building has been torn down. =London Mills High School= London Mills' schools originated in 1835. New buildings were completed in 1875 and 1912, with a gym addition occurring in 1936, and a final addition in 1939. The London High School mascot was the Lions, with school colors of orange and black. The school consolidated into the Spoon River Valley district in 1948. The 1912 building has since been torn down. =Maquon High School= Maquon first began building schools in the mid-to-late 19th century, with its first high school graduating class occurring in 1891. The first known building was completed in 1866, a simple two-story frame building. In 1904 a larger brick school building was completed adjacent to the original building, with a gym addition occurring in 1934. When the Spoon River Valley consolidation occurred in 1948 Maquon was originally part of the plan. However, in July before the 1948 school year began Maquon petition to detach from the newly formed Spoon River Valley in order to attend Knoxville schools. The petition was short-lived, as irregularies were found and Maqon reverted into the Spoon River Valley district under the original planned. Therefore, in 1949 the full Spoon River Valley High School was realized and students from Maquon were bused to Fairview, the location of the district's high school.

Dancoff was raised in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. He attended Carnegie Tech on a private scholarship and received his B.S. in physics in 1934, followed by a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1936. He then went to the University of California at Berkeley where he earned his PhD in 1939 under Robert Oppenheimer. While Dancoff was at Berkeley, Oppenheimer suggested that he work on the calculation of the scattering of a relativistic electron by an electric field. Such QED calculations typically gave infinite answers. Following earlier perturbation-theory work by Oppenheimer and Felix Bloch, he found that he could deal in various ways with the infinities that arose, sometimes by canceling a positive infinity with a negative one. However, some infinities remained uncanceled and the method (later called renormalization) did not give finite results. He published a general description of this work in 1939.S. M. Dancoff, Physical Review 55, p. 959 (1939) In 1948, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and his students revisited this paper. Using improved calculational methods, they found that Dancoff had omitted one term or two terms. Once they repaired this omission, Dancoff's method worked, and they built on it to produce a theory of QED, for which Tomonaga shared the Nobel Prize in 1965. (At the same time, American physicists discovered Dancoff's error and solved QED, relying less directly on Dancoff.) During the Second World War, Dancoff worked on the theory of the newly invented nuclear reactors. To take into account how fuel rods could \\"shadow\\" other rods by absorbing neutrons headed toward the other rods, he and M. Ginsburg developed the Dancoff factor, still used in reactor calculations.S. M. Dancoff and M. Ginsburg, \\"Surface Resonance Absorption in Packed Lattice\\", USAEC-report CP-2157 (1944). After the war, Dancoff was on the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1950 he published an approximation method for many-body theory that has been used in nuclear and solid-state physics.S. M. Dancoff, Physical Review 78, 382 (1950). Igor Tamm had found it in 1945,I. Tamm, Journal of Physics (USSR) 9, 449 (1945) and the method is now named after both. In the late 1940s, Dancoff began a collaboration with the Viennese-refugee physician and radiologist Henry Quastler in the new field of cybernetics and information theory. Their work led to the publication of what is now commonly called Dancoff's Law. A non-mathematical statement of this law is, \\"the greatest growth occurs when the greatest number of mistakes are made consistent with survival\\". Dancoff died of lymphoma in 1951.

Professional career Stapleton was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the tenth round (231st overall) of the 1975 amateur baseball draft and over the next five years worked his way up the Red Sox minor league system playing for Winter Haven, Bristol, and Pawtucket. He made his first appearance for the Red Sox on May 30, 1980.http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1980/B05300BOS1980.htm During his time with the Red Sox, he primarily served as a utility player, covering first base, second base, shortstop and third base as well as playing in the outfield and serving as designated hitter. In and he served as the team's first baseman, losing the job to Bill Buckner in . From 1984 to 1986, Stapleton only played 82 games for the Red Sox. During Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, Red Sox manager John McNamara left Buckner in the game rather than replace him with Stapleton for defensive purposes, leading to the Mookie Wilson ground ball that went through Buckner's legs, giving the New York Mets a come-from- behind win in the tenth inning. The Mets went on to win the Series four games to three. After the 1986 season, Stapleton became a free agent and signed with the Seattle Mariners, but was released on March 31, 1987, prior to the start of the regular season. In his career, Stapleton batted .271 (550-2028), with 41 home runs, 224 RBI, 238 runs, 118 doubles, eight triple, six stolen bases, a .310 on-base percentage, and 807 total bases for a .398 slugging average.

He works at Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey County as a professor of biology at Stanford University and was involved with the television special The Future is Wild. Gilly received a BSE (Electrical Engineering, 1972) from Princeton University and a Ph.D. (Physiology and Biophysics, 1978) from Washington University in St. Louis. He had additional training at Yale University, University of Pennsylvania and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. Over the last 30 years he has contributed to the basic understanding of electrical excitability in nerve and muscle cells in a wide range of organisms ranging from brittle-stars to mammals. Much of this work employed the giant axon system of the squid as an experimental model system for molecular and biophysical approaches. Additional physiological studies made in the living squid revealed unexpected complexities in how the giant axon system controls escape responses, and how mechanisms governing that control are subject to modification by environmental factors like temperature and during normal development. Gilly's current research program on squid concentrates on the behavior and physiology of Dosidicus gigas, the jumbo or Humboldt squid. Fieldwork in the Gulf of California and off Monterey Bay employs a variety of tagging methodologies in order to track short-term vertical migrations as well as long-distance migrations. Gilly was nominated by Stanford University to be one of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Nifty Fifty Speakers who spoke about his work and career to middle and high school students in October 2010.

It was the first independent political party that was publicly proclaimed in the Eastern Bloc, it was however unrecognized by the People's Republic of Poland government and its chief activists were arrested several times. It didn't participate in the Polish Roundtable Negotiations. After the fall of communism, Leszek Moczulski was a candidate in the elections for Polish president, but got only 2.5% of votes in the 1990 presidential election and withdrew during the following one. In the 1991 parliamentary election the party got 7.5% of the vote, while in the 1993 parliamentary election it received 5.7%. In 1996 it suffered a split, with the faction under leaving KPN. KPN then joined Solidarity Electoral Action, but left it in 1997, before the 1997 parliamentary election, in which it didn't participate. For the 2001 parliamentary elections, it allied itself with Solidarity Electoral Action of the Right (AWSP), but its candidates got 0.08% and the AWSP (which got 5.6%) failed to elect a single representative (the threshold was 8%).

One of three highways within Essex County, Highway 77 serves to interconnect Highway 3 near Leamington with Highway 401 near Tilbury. Prior to 1998, the highway extended south into Leamington, ending at the former routing of Highway 3 and Highway 18. This section was turned over to Essex County and renamed Erie Street. The speed limit on Highway 77 is in most places, dropping to 50 km/h in built-up areas. It is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police.  Route description  Due to the flat topography of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway 77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, and as a result very few natural areas can be found in the county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77. Highway 77 begins at the Leamington Bypass, north of the city of the same name. The western section of Highway 3 shares its eastern terminus with Highway 77; from there it travels west towards Windsor. Several greenhouses are visible near the southern end of the highway, a small percentage of the of land occupied by them in the Leamington area. Point Pelee National Park, the southernmost point in Canada, is also nearby. The highway runs north through Mount Carmel and Blytheswood to the village of Staples before turning to the east. It continues in this direction for before returning to its northward orientation. North of there, the highway passes to the east of the Comber and District Historical Society Museum. The museum, which focuses on the history of agriculture, was established in the former Maple Grove Schoolhouse, which was built in 1894. Pressing north to Highway 401, it passes Middle Road (once Highway 98) in the centre of Comber. Highway 401 provides access to Windsor and the United States to the west, and to the town of Tilbury and city of Chatham–Kent to the east. To the north, the road continues as Essex County Road 35 to Stoney Point on the shores of Lake St. Clair. Traffic levels along Highway 77 vary, but are generally low. The busiest section of the highway lies at the southern end between Leamington and Blythesville, with an average of 6,000 vehicles travelling it per day. North of that, traffic drops considerably to 3,000 vehicles, but increases approaching Comber and Highway 401 to around 4,500.  History  The Highway 77 designation was first applied on August 5, 1936 to a road running southeast from Rodney, Ontario to Highway 3 at New Glasgow. On December 5, 1957, the highway was transferred to Elgin County and is now known as Elgin County Road 103. The current Highway 77 was designated between Leamington and Highway 401 on April 1, 1963. The southern end followed present-day Erie Street south through the city to Talbot Road. At the time, Highway 3 travelled along that road; Highway 77 continued south of Talbot Road as Highway 18. In early December 1999, the Leamington Bypass of Highway 3 opened. The southern terminus of Highway 77 was subsequently truncated by to end at the new bypass.

Stone is more durable than most alternative materials, making it especially important in architectural sculpture on the outside of buildings. Stone carving includes a number of techniques where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged in some form of stonework, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Persia(Iran), Greece, Central America, India and most of Europe. Often, as in Indian sculpture, stone is the only material in which ancient monumental sculpture has survived (along with smaller terracottas), although there was almost certainly more wooden sculpture created at the time. Unakoti group of rock reliefs of Shiva, Tripura, India. 11th century Petroglyphs (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains in situ, by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Rock reliefs, carved into \\"living\\" rock, are a more advanced stage of this. Monumental sculpture covers large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings. Historically, much of these types was painted, usually after a thin coat of plaster was applied. Hardstone carving is the carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, sard or carnelian, and a general term for an object made in this way. Alabaster or mineral gypsum is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable. Engraved gems are small carved gems, including cameos, originally used as seal rings. Boundary wall featuring a dry stone sculpture, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, UK Ancient Egyptian triple portrait in greywacke, a very hard sandstone that takes a fine polish Carving stone into sculpture is an activity older than civilization itself, beginning perhaps with incised images on cave walls. Page 9. Prehistoric sculptures were usually human forms, such as the Venus of Willendorf and the faceless statues of the Cycladic cultures of ancient Greece. Later cultures devised animal, human-animal and abstract forms in stone. The earliest cultures used abrasive techniques, and modern technology employs pneumatic hammers and other devices. But for most of human history, sculptors used a hammer and chisel as the basic tools for carving stone. Types of stone used in carved sculptures Soapstone, with a Mohs hardness of about 2, is an easily worked stone, commonly used by beginning students of stone carving. Alabaster and softer kinds of serpentine, all about 3 on the Mohs scale, are more durable than soapstone. Alabaster, in particular, has long been cherished for its translucence. Limestone and sandstone, at about 4 on the Mohs scale, are the only sedimentary stones commonly carved.Liebson, page 20. Limestone comes in a popular oolitic variety, about twice as hard as alabaster, that is excellent for carving.Liebson, page 21. The harder serpentines can also reach 4 on the Mohs scale. Marble, travertine, and onyx are at about 6 on the Mohs scale. Marble has been the preferred stone for sculptors in the European tradition ever since the time of classical Greece. It is available in a wide variety of colors, from white through pink and red to grey and black. The hardest stone frequently carved is granite, at about 8 on the Mohs scale. It is the most durable of sculptural stones and, correspondingly, an extremely difficult stone to work. Basalt columns, being even harder than the granite, are less frequently carved. This stone takes on a beautiful black appearance when polished. Rough and unfinished statues Rough block forms of unfinished statuary are known and are in museums. Notable are the Akhenaten, Amarna Period statuary found at Akhetaten. One known sculptor, Thutmose (sculptor), has his entire shop excavated at Akhetaten, with many unfinished block forms. The process of stone sculpture different mallets and pitching tool Roughed out carvings This shows the process of \\"pointing\\", the traditional method of making exact copies in stone carving. A point machine is used to measure points on the original sculpture (seen on the right) and transfer those points onto the stone copy (left). Here we see the very early stages, where points have been measured and marked on the stone copy. These markings point out the high points of the surface so that the stone carver knows which surfaces to sink and which to leave alone. In the direct method of stone carving, the work usually begins with the selection of stone for carving, the qualities of which will influence the artist's choices in the design process. The artist using the direct method may use sketches but eschews the use of a physical model. The fully dimensional form or figure is created for the first time in the stone itself, as the artist removes material, sketches on the block of stone, and develops the work along the way.Liebson, pages 63-64. On the other hand, is the indirect method, when the sculptor begins with a clearly defined model to be copied in stone. The models, usually made of plaster or modeling clay, may be fully the size of the intended sculpture and fully detailed. Once the model is complete, a suitable stone must be found to fit the intended design.Liebson, pages 63-64. The model is then copied in stone by measuring with calipers or a pointing machine. This method is frequently used when the carving is done by other sculptors, such as artisans or employees of the sculptor. Some artists use the stone itself as inspiration; the Renaissance artist Michelangelo claimed that his job was to free the human form hidden inside the block. =Copying by \\"pointing\\"= The copying of an original statue in stone, which was very important for Ancient Greek statues, which are nearly all known from copies, was traditionally achieved by \\"pointing\\", along with more freehand methods. Pointing involved setting up a grid of string squares on a wooden frame surrounding the original, and then measuring the position on the grid and the distance between grid and statue of a series of individual points, and then using this information to carve into the block from which the copy is made. Robert Manuel Cook notes that Ancient Greek copyists seem to have used many fewer points than some later ones, and copies often vary considerably in the composition as well as the finish.Cook, R.M., Greek Art, p. 147, Penguin, 1986 (reprint of 1972), =Roughing out= When he or she is ready to carve, the carver usually begins by knocking off, or \\"pitching\\", large portions of unwanted stone. For this task, he may select a point chisel, which is a long, hefty piece of steel with a point at one end and a broad striking surface at the other. A pitching tool may also be used at this early stage; which is a wedge-shaped chisel with a broad, flat edge. The pitching tool is useful for splitting the stone and removing large, unwanted chunks. The sculptor also selects a mallet, which is often a hammer with a broad, barrel-shaped head. The carver places the point of the chisel or the edge of the pitching tool against a selected part of the stone, then swings the mallet at it with a controlled stroke. He must be careful to strike the end of the tool accurately; the smallest miscalculation can damage the stone, not to mention the sculptor’s hand. When the mallet connects to the tool, energy is transferred along the tool, shattering the stone. Most sculptors work rhythmically, turning the tool with each blow so that the stone is removed quickly and evenly. This is the “roughing out” stage of the sculpting process. =Refining= Once the general shape of the statue has been determined, the sculptor uses other tools to refine the figure. A toothed chisel or claw chisel has multiple gouging surfaces which create parallel lines in the stone. These tools are generally used to add texture to the figure. An artist might mark out specific lines by using calipers to measure an area of stone to be addressed and marking the removal area with pencil, charcoal or chalk. The stone carver generally uses a shallower stroke at this point in the process. =Final stages= Eventually, the sculptor has changed the stone from a rough block into the general shape of the finished statue. Tools called rasps and rifflers are then used to enhance the shape into its final form. A rasp is a flat, steel tool with a coarse surface. The sculptor uses broad, sweeping strokes to remove excess stone as small chips or dust. A riffler is a smaller variation of the rasp, which can be used to create details such as folds of clothing or locks of hair. The final stage of the carving process is polishing. Sandpaper can be used as a first step in the polishing process or sand cloth. Emery, a stone that is harder and rougher than the sculpture media, is also used in the finishing process. This abrading, or wearing away, brings out the colour of the stone, reveals patterns in the surface and adds a sheen. Tin and iron oxides are often used to give the stone a highly reflective exterior. Today, modern stone sculptors use diamond abrasives to sand in the final finishing processes. This can be achieved by hand pads in rough to fine abrasives ranging from 36 grit to 3000 grit. Also, diamond pads mounted on water-cooled rotary air or electric sanders speed the finishing process.  Contemporary techniques  Sculptor Karen LaMonte examines Cumulus, a stone sculpture that she created with the help of weather models, a super computer, and robots. In the 21st century, stone sculpture has grown to encompass technologically advanced tools including robots, super computers, and algorithms. In 2017, Karen LaMonte first displayed Cumulus, her eight-foot-tall, two-and-a-half ton sculpture of a cumulus cloud carved from Italian marble. To create the work, LaMonte collaborated with California Institute of Technology scientists to model conditions needed to create a cumulus cloud. She then replicated the resulting cloud model in marble using a combination of robot and hand carving. \\"Rarely does someone just start chipping away in stone,\\" LaMonte told Caltech magazine. \\"Think about Michelangelo; he submerged his wax model of David in water, exposing it layer by layer and carving the marble to match the emerging figure. Three hundred years later, Antonio Canova perfected the pointing machine to transfer exact points from a model onto marble, followed by Benjamin Cheverton’s patented 3-D pantograph. Only by using technology could I make the diaphanous solid and the intangible permanent.\\" The sculpture required four weeks of robot-driven carving, followed by four weeks of hand- finishing, to complete.

Eisenhower rode into Paris. Gorman was born in Chicago and died at his Chicago home. Admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1940 after graduation from Chicago-Kent College of Law, Gorman was a conscientious objector in the early years of World War II until the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, at which time he joined American forces, served as an interpreter with the allied army in France, and rose to the rank of lieutenant. After the war he practiced probate and civil rights law and was counsel for Roosevelt University in Chicago.  Legal career  While at the Northwestern University Law School, Gorman was elected Justice (President) Of Phi Alpha Delta, the country's largest co-ed legal fraternity. Later, he became Justice of the Chicago Alumni Chapter and was also elected District Justice which covered a four state area. Gorman received his law degree in 1940 from Chicago-Kent College of Law. After graduation from law school, he was admitted to the Illinois State Bar Association on October 10, 1940 and immediately entered private practice. Shortly after war was declared, Gorman served four years as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, being honorably discharged in January 1946. After serving in World War II, he practiced probate and civil rights law and was counsel for Roosevelt University in Chicago from the time of the school's inception during the 1940s until his retirement four decades later.

Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. Ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F.

The first mention of Alexander occurs when, as a canon of Dunkeld he is one of three ambassadors sent by King Robert I of Scotland to Avignon in 1320.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 111. The purpose of this embassy was to present a letter to Pope John XXII known as the Declaration of Arbroath. As a papal chaplain and lawyer, he was well qualified to argue the Scottish cause, and Barrow makes a strong case that he was, in fact the author of the document.Barrow, Robert Bruce and the Community of The Realm of Scotland, pp305-308. Biography He became Archdeacon of Lothian in 1327,Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 310. and by 1329 held a prebend in the diocese of Brechin; he is also a papal chaplain and an auditor of the papal palace at Avignon.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 110; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 2. In that year, after the death of Henry le Chen, Walter Herok was elected Bishop of Aberdeen and travelled to Avignon to receive consecration from Pope John XXII. However, Walter died there, apparently before receiving consecration and Alexander, a papal servant from Scotland, was provided to the now vacant see without any consultation of the chapter of Aberdeen.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 110-1. Alexander was back in Scotland by 29 March 1330, when he attended a parliament of King David I of Scotland.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 111; Innes, Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, p. xxxviii. Four years later, on 12 February 1334, he was present at the parliament of the usurper-king Edward Balliol. In 1335 he was one of the envoys sent to make peace with England. According to Hector Boece, Alexander was a distinguished scholar and began work on building four new episcopal residences, at Mortlach, Aberdeen, Fetternear and Rayne; Aberdeen and Fetterneir were said to have been completed.Innes, Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, p. xxxviii.

He debuted with the collection of short stories Veien vi gaar (The Way We Go) in 1922. His breakthrough came with Syndere i sommersol (Sinners in Summertime, 1927), which was made into a film in 1932 and in 2002. Life He was the son of teacher Lars Anton and Elisa Dorothea Hoel, and grew up in Odalen. He was admitted into Ragna Nielsens school in Kristiania, but when he finished school in 1909, he could not afford to begin college right away. He worked for a while as an insurance salesman before he could begin his studies in 1910, during which time he supported himself with teaching jobs. In 1913 he was an employee at Ragna Nielsens school. In his time at college he was the editor of the periodical Minerva. His literary career began with the short story \\"Idioten\\" (The Idiot) from 1918, when he won a writing contest. The same year he became an employee of \\"Socialdemokraten\\" as a literature and theater critic. In 1920 he wrote the comedy Den Enes Død together with his friend Finn Bø. Harald Grieg got him a job as a consultant for Gyldendal Norsk Forlag and Erling Falk made him the editor of Mot Dag. In 1924 he traveled to Berlin to study socialism, and there he wrote his first novel, Syvstjernen (The Seven Star). He continued on to Paris, where he met Nic Waal (died 1960), whom he married in Norway in 1927. They separated in 1936, and the same year he married again, this time to Ada Ivan. From 1934 to 1939 Hoel was a co-worker of Wilhelm Reich who then had chosen Oslo as his exile. Since January 1934 he had received training analysis from Reich but the extent of his own practice as a therapist was limited to four patients. Hoel contributed to Reich's German language periodical Zeitschrift für Politische Psychologie und Sexualökonomie (Journal for Political Psychology and Sex Economy) and was the editor-in-chief of issues nos. 13 to 15.Zeitschrift für Politische Psychologie und Sexualökonomie One of his major essays deals with the Moscow Trials.Der Moskauer Prozess (German) During the war Hoel and his wife went back to Odalen. He participated in the Resistance, and wrote articles for the Resistance press. In 1943 he was forced to flee to Sweden. Hoel had a short connection to the landsmål movement, but later played an active part in the riksmål campaign. He was among the founders of the Author's Association of 1952 and was the chairman of the Riksmål Society from 1956 to 1959. He died of a heart attack at age 69. Body of Work Veien til verdens ende (Road to the World's End, 1933) is a child's portrayal from a farm environment and is considered one of his key works, together with, among other things, the novel Møte ved Milepelen (Meeting at the Milestone, 1947). In this novel he both distances himself from Nazism and portrays the confrontation of war as a problem. The last novel, Trollringen (The Troll Circle, 1958), is also among his best-known works. As the main consultant for Norwegian and translated literature for Gyldendal publishing, Hoel made an impression on a whole generation of Norwegian literature. From 1929 to 1959 Hoel was the editor of the publisher's \\"Gold Series\\", where he introduced a number of foreign authors, often with an astounding foresight for which works would remain. The series comprised 101 books—among others, works from authors such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Franz Kafka. Hoel wrote prefaces for all of the books, and the preferences are collected in the books 50 gold (1939) and The last 51 gold (1959). References Works * Knut Hamsun, O.

Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Until the mid 20th century, this species was considered a sub-species of the cinereous tinamou, but due to its bill size, its ratio of toe and tarsus length and the fact that its plumage has conspicuous differences from that of the cinereous tinamou created enough of a question for the new species to be named. Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) berlepschi comes from the Latin form of Berlepsch to commemorate the German ornithologist and collector Hans von Berlepsch. Description Berlepsch's tinamou is a medium- sized bird, about , with the male weighing and the female weighing . The plumage of this bird varies somewhat; however there are some features that can be quantified, such as, in general the color is a brownish black to a deep sooty brown. Also, the head and throat tend to be darker than the rest of the body, with a reddish tinge to its crown and nape. The legs and feet are pink and the bill has a dark upper mandible and a pinkish lower mandible. Its bill is longer and heavier than that of the cinereous tinamou. Finally, its iris is red. The juvenile form of the bird is similar in coloring to the adult; however it does have barring on its under-parts and also on its wings with a cinnamon tinge to them. Range and habitat Its range is extreme northern coastal Ecuador north into coastal Colombia, as far north as Utria National Park (Bahia de Capica). This tinamou lives in lowland moist forest in sub- tropical to tropical regions, and will also choose to live in a mature secondary forest. It has also proven that it can survive in forests that have been logged. In Colombia it will choose the coastal lowlands and hills up to , although it has been found as high as . The only 2 documented sightings are at Playa de oro reserva de los tigrillos, which is in Ecuador about north of Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve and at Milipe Bird Sanctuary about west of Maquipucuna, also in Ecuador. Behavior The Berlepsch's tinamou is considered a sedentary bird. =Feeding= There is little species specific information on Berlepsch's tinamou, so scientists believe that like other members of Crypturellus its diet focus is on fleshy fruit, which it prefers to eat off the ground, but will pick it off lower hanging branches. Like other tinamous, the Berlepsch's also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. =Breeding= They breed in February in Colombia. As a forest species, they would choose the months of plentiful food and that would mean the summer. The male, like other tinamou, incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Conservation The IUCN classifies the Berlepshch's tinamou as Least Concern, and it has an occurrence range of .

The system consists of two lakes: Lake Bryde, with an area of ; and East Lake Bryde, with an area of about . They are located at the head of a chain of lakes that extend to Lake Magenta, and ultimately form part of the Swan-Avon drainage system. Description The system is situated in the Shire of Kent, south-west of Newdegate. It in part of the Western Mallee biogeographic subregion of the Mallee region of the South West Botanic Province. The Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde system contains the only shrub-dominated lake bed vegetation community in the province. This community, which consists mainly of the critically endangered Muehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita (Remote Thorny Lignum) and Tecticornia verrucosa, has been declared a critically endangered threatened ecological community under the name \\"Bryde\\". The lakes experience a regular cycle of freshwater flooding followed by gradual drying, and their vegetation depends upon that cycle for its survival. Since the 1980s, rises in the water table caused by extensive land clearing for agriculture has resulted in greatly increased salinity of the area, increasing the lakes' salt load from 160 tons to around 1200 tons. Furthermore, changes to the area's hydrology have greatly increased the frequency of flooding. These factors have caused a severe decline in the extent and condition of the shrub beds. Because of the threat to M. h. subsp. abdita and the ecological community as a whole, the lakes are protected by the Lake Bryde Nature Reserve. The lake system has been identified as important to bird life, with sixteen bird species recorded there. It has also been found to support a substantially greater diversity of aquatic invertebrates than surrounding lake systems.

In 1945, Macher led a group of 15 SS specialists who were ordered by Himmler to blow up the SS castle Wewelsburg near Paderborn in order to ensure that the devotional objects and important files should not fall into the hands of the Allies. The demolition command arrived on 31 March 1945. The same day, after Macher had informed the local fire brigade, the south-east tower, the least important tower of the large castle, was blown up. Because of lack of explosives they could not blow up the rest of the complex. Macher ordered the firemen not to extinguish the fire so that most of the complex was nevertheless destroyed. Macher was also charged with the task of burying the castle's treasures, including over 9,000 Death's Head rings held in a shrine to commemorate SS men killed in action. These treasures have never been found. During the last few days of the war, Himmler, Macher and Grothmann traveled from Lübeck to Flensburg, where Himmler offered his services as second-in-command to the new interim government led by Karl Dönitz, who had been appointed a successor to Adolf Hitler. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. Dismissed from his posts and unwanted by his former colleagues, Himmler attempted to go into hiding in order to avoid capture. Himmler equipped himself with a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger of the Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police), which was a mistake since members of this organization were sought after by the liberation forces. Macher and Grothmann were both dressed as army privates. Macher, Himmler and Grothmann were stopped at a checkpoint, which had been set up by former Soviet POWs, on 21 May and detained. The three men were taken to an Allied barracks in Lüneburg on 23 May. During a routine interrogation, Himmler admitted who he was; thereafter, at the headquarters of the Second British Army, during an attempted medical examination Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and died. After Himmler's suicide, Macher and Grothmann were arrested.Photograph of Heinz Macher next to Himmler Macher appeared publicly in April 1966, along with other former SS officers, at the funeral of Josef Dietrich, displaying the medals of the late SS leader.Photograph of the funeral of Sepp Dietrich He died on 21 December 2001 in Schenefeld, Pinneberg.This article incorporates information from the corresponding article in the Spanish Wikipedia Awards * Iron Cross (1939) 2nd Class (24 September 1941) & 1st Class (25 March 1942) * German Cross in Gold on 7 August 1944 as SS-Obersturmführer in the 16.(Pi.)/SS-Panzergrenadier-Regiment 3 \\"Deutschland\\" * Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ** Knight's Cross on 3 April 1943 as SS-Untersturmführer and leader of the 16.(Pi.)/SS- Panzergrenadier-Regiment \\"Deutschland\\" ** 554th Oak Leaves on 19 August 1944 as SS-Obersturmführer and chief of the 16.(Pi.)/SS-Panzergrenadier-Regiment 3 \\"Deutschland\\" References =Citations= =Bibliography=  1919 births 2001 deaths SS-Sturmbannführer People from Chemnitz Recipients of the Gold German Cross Recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves Personal staff of Heinrich Himmler Waffen-SS personnel ","title":"Heinz Macher"},{"id":"9684187","text":"Nepean Teaching Hospital is a 520-bed teaching hospital.

On 7 July, Brigadier-General Timberlake deputy-commander of the Fifth Air Force ordered the development of the base. Company A 802nd Engineer Aviation Battalion landed at Pohang and began improving the airfield on 12 July by added a PSP extension and building hardstands for 27 F-51 Mustangs. The airfield was designated by the USAF as K-3. Troops of the Korean People's Army (KPA) 12th Division infiltrated the Pohang area in early August and made guerilla attacks against the airfield. By 12 August KPA troops entered Pohang and so on 13 August the 35th Fighter- Interceptor Group evacuated to Tsuiki Air Field in Japan. ROK and U.S. forces routed the KPA several days later, but the continued presence of guerilla units mitigated against an early return to the base.

Reuben (born August 2, 1960) is a historian interested in the role of education in American society and culture. Her teaching and research address broad questions about the purposes of education; the relation between educational institutions and political and social concerns; and the forces that shape educational change. Biography Reuben is Charles Warren Professor of the History of American Education on the faculty of the Harvard University Graduate School of Education. She received her BA in history from Brandeis University and her MA and PhD in history from Stanford University. She has been selected as a fellow for the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and received a Major Research Grant from the Spencer Foundation. She is the author of Making of the Modern University: Intellectual Transformation and the Marginalization of Morality, selected as a Choice Outstanding Academic Book. This book examines the relation between changing conceptions of knowledge, standards of scholarship, and the position of religion and morality in the American university during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The book draws on examples from eight universities: Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Chicago, Stanford, Michigan, and Berkeley. A review by Landy compares Reuben's work to that of George Marsden, who is more directly concerned with the role of religion and Christianity. She has written a number of articles related to campus activism, access to higher education, curriculum changes, and citizenship education in the public schools. She is currently working on a book, tentatively entitled Campus Revolts: Politics and the American University in the 1960s, which will be the first serious historical study of campus protests and their impact on American higher education.

The Laguna Lake Development Authority was created by virtue of Republic Act No. 4850 (as amended by Presidential Decree 813), entitled: AN ACT CREATING THE LAGUNA LAKE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, PRESCRIBING ITS POWERS, FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREOF, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES. Since 1993, LLDA is attached to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) pursuant to EO 149, for administrative supervision and policy alignment.  History  The Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) was established in 1966 as a quasi-government agency that leads, promotes, and accelerates sustainable development in the Laguna de Bay Region. Regulatory and law-enforcement functions are carried out with provisions on environmental management, particularly on water quality monitoring, conservation of natural resources, and community-based natural resource management. The LLDA on August 7, 2009, approved the water permit application of Maynilad to allow the West Zone concessionaire to abstract 100 million liters per day of lake water to be made available for domestic consumption. Maynilad started the production of 50 MLD last June 2010 and expects to produce 100 MLD in September this year using surface raw water from Laguna de Bay. Programs * Environmental User's Fee * Shoreland Management * Implementation of the Zoning and Management Plan (ZOMAP) * River Rehabilitation =Environmental Management Program= LLDA puts into action systems and programs such as Environmental User Fee System (EUFS), Public Disclosure Program (PDP), the Appropriation and Utilization of Surface Waters (Surface Waters) for the management of the lake waters and tributaries that flow into the Lake, to ensure their proper use and maintenance for the sustainability of the ecosystem. The Environmental User Fee System To realize the objectives of the creation of LLDA, the agency implemented policies to curb the possibility of stressing the lake’s assimilative capacity. The most recent policy was the Environmental User Fee System (EUFS). The EUFS was implemented by virtue of LLDA Board Resolution 22 in 1996. The objective of the policy was to “…(reduce) the pollution loading in to the Laguna de Bay by enjoining all discharges of liquid wastes to internalize the cost of environmental degradation…”. Formally, the said board resolution aptly defined the EUFS as a “market–based” policy instrument aimed at reducing the pollution loading in the lake. As such, companies found to have unusually high concentration of pollutants in their emissions, need to pay fines or lake “user–fees”. The system encourages companies to invest in and operate pollution prevention and/or abatement systems in their establishment. Applying the \\"polluter pays principle\\", the system effects direct accountability for damage inflicted on the integrity of the Laguna de Bay region thereby encouraging individuals and business establishments to internalize into their decision-making process the environmental impacts of their day-to-day activities. The EUFS covers all enterprises in the administrative jurisdiction of LLDA that discharge wastewater in the Laguna de Bay system. These include commercial and industrial establishments; agro-based industries and establishments (such as swine farms and slaughterhouses); clustered dwellings (i.e., residential subdivisions); and domestic householdsLaguna Lake Development Authority (2001) Annual financial report CY 2001. Pasig City, Metro Manila: Author Under the EUFS, a firm is required to secure a discharge permit which is renewed annually at the LLDA. The discharge permit effectively allows the firm to discharge its wastewater to the lake or through its main tributaries. The discharge permit gives the establishment a legal right to dispose their waste water in the Laguna de Bay region. Wastewater is basically sewage, storm water, and water used around the community, including firms. Domestic wastewater includes black water, or wastewater from toilets, and gray water, which is wastewater from all sources except toilets. Black water and gray water have different characteristics, but both contain pollutants and disease-causing agents that require monitoring.

Wisconsin Air National Guard (WI ANG) is the aerial militia of the State of Wisconsin, United States of America. It is, along with the Wisconsin Army National Guard, an element of the Wisconsin National Guard. As state militia units, the units in the Wisconsin Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Wisconsin through the office of the Wisconsin Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Wisconsin Air National Guard is headquartered in Madison. Overview Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, Wisconsin Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Wisconsin ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Wisconsin Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the Wisconsin ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. Components The Wisconsin Air National Guard consists of the following major units: * 115th Fighter Wing : Established 6 October 1948 (as: 176th Fighter Squadron); operates: F-16 Fighting Falcon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II (arrive 2023) : Stationed at: Truax Field Air National Guard Base, Madison : Gained by: Air Combat Command : The 115th Fighter Wing provides multi-role fighter support including air-to-air, close air support and precision guided bombing. The wing currently operates the latest generation of munitions such as the JDAM series bombs and the AIM-9X air-to- air missile.115th Fighter Wing website * 128th Air Refueling Wing : Established 30 July 1940 (as: 126th Observation Squadron); operates: KC-135R Stratotanker : Stationed at: General Mitchell Air National Guard Base, Milwaukee : Gained by: Air Mobility Command : The 128th Air Refueling Wing principal mission is air refueling. The wing enhances the Air Force's capability to accomplish its primary missions of Global Reach and Global Power.128th Air Refueling Wing website Support Unit Functions and Capabilities: * 128th Air Control Squadron : Maintains and operates a transportable extension of the Theater Air Control System. In this role the unit provides: (1) An air picture via data links from multiple sensors to the theater commander, (2) Radar control for offensive and defensive air operations, (3) Early warning, detection and tracking of surveillance data, (4) Personnel training and equipment maintenance to sustain a state of readiness for worldwide deployment. * Volk Field Combat Readiness Training Center : Provides a year-round integrated training environment (airspace, facilities, equipment) for units to enhance their combat capabilities and readiness. History The Militia Act of 1903 established the present National Guard system, units raised by the states but paid for by the Federal Government, liable for immediate state service. If federalized by presidential order, they fall under the regular military chain of command. On 1 June 1920, the Militia Bureau issued Circular No.1 on organization of National Guard air units.ANG Chronology 1908-2007, see also Brief History of the Minnesota Air National Guard and the 133rd Airlift Wing, 1. North American O-47A from the 126th Observation Squadron, Wisconsin National Guard. Unlike prewar observation squadrons, the 126th was not assigned to a National Guard division, rather it was assigned directly in support of the II Army Corps and performed various duties, including photographing portions of the Carolina Maneuvers in the autumn of 1941. The Wisconsin Air National Guard origins date to 30 July 1940 with the establishment of the 126th Observation Squadron and is oldest unit of the Wisconsin Air National Guard. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The 126th Observation Squadron was ordered into active service on 2 June 1941 as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps prior to the United States entry into World War II. On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re- establish them as Air National Guard units.

Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 F-51 Mustangs of the Wisconsin Air National Guard, circa 1950 The modern Wisconsin ANG received federal recognition on 25 June 1947 as the 126th Fighter Squadron at General Mitchell Field, Milwaukee. It was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of the state. On 6 October 1948 the 176th Fighter Squadron was formed at Truax Field, Madison, also equipped with F-51D Mustangs with an air defense mission. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Wisconsin Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. On 23 June 1948, the 126th Fighter Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level and the 128th Fighter Group was federally recognized at Milwaukee. The 115th Fighter-Interceptor Group was federally recognized at Madison on 15 April 1956 when the 176th Fighter Squadron was expanded to a Group. Today, the 128th Air Refueling Wing (128th ARW) provides aerial refueling support to Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and allied nation aircraft. The 115th Fighter Wing (115 FW) files the Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcon fighter and is part of the USAF Air Combat Command attack forces performing air-interdiction and close air support (CAS). After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Wisconsin has been activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle air defense overflights of major United States cities. Also, Wisconsin ANG units have been deployed overseas as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as well as other locations.

It is an all-girl school from kindergarten up to grade 11. There is also a CEGEP, named CIM, for girls and boys. History In September 1959, the Marcelline nuns opened the doors of the school to 66 students in the \\"Aimé Geoffrion\\" mansion on Upper Belmont Avenue in Westmount. Six years later, the school bought the next door house but it would only be in 1988 that the school would experience its first big constructions. These works made it possible to join both houses to create a bigger school. The students now benefitted from a new gym, auditorium and several science labs. With the expansion of the school, it increased its student population and diversified its extracurriculars. It became a first choice school for elite French families and for wealthy English families wanting to integrate their children in a French environment to improve their command of the French language. Nowadays the school is known to be the only French private school in Westmount and the one located at the very top of the Hill. Often, the acronym 'VSM' is used to replace the school's full name. In 2005, the school expanded yet again, building an adjacent building containing a gym, a new cafeteria, a computer lab, a library and class spaces for the cegep. The school is also one of the few in Montreal that offers a trilingual program (English, French, Spanish) throughout the whole secondary.

Career Martinez began surfing at age 6. When he was old enough, he joined the National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA) where he went on to win a record seven national titles. After several injury-prone years he joined the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) in 2005 and permanently pursued qualification for the ASP World Championship Tour (WCT). His first major title as a professional was the O'Neill Coldwater Classic in 2005. He joined the World Championship Tour in 2006, finishing the year with a No. 5 ranking which earned him Rookie of the Year honors with wins in Teahupoo and Mundaka. He also won in Mundaka in 2007. In May 2009, Martinez won the Billabong Pro Tahiti for the second time. He featured in the 2007 biopic Mixed Tape, produced by Pete Santa Maria. Notable sponsors during his career included O'Neill, Reef Brazil, Channel Islands Surfboards, Monster Energy Drink, and FTW.  End of ASP career  On September 7, 2011 Martinez was suspended from competition by the ASP after publicly criticizing the organization in a post- heat interview with commentator Todd Kline. Disillusioned with the implementation of a new ASP international ranking system modeled after professional tennis, Martinez had skipped the J-Bay and Tahiti contests earlier in the year due to poor wave quality, resulting in the implementation of a new ASP policy establishing fines and suspensions for surfers who miss Championship Tour competition without medical release. This had further strained his relationship with the restructured ASP, which was positioning itself for rebranding and new investment as the World Surf League. With a 2011 World No. 22 ranking that left him in danger of being relegated to surfing's second tier (the Qualifying Series, then known as the World Qualifying Series) after the upcoming mid-year cutoff, Martinez had already announced that New York would be his final competition. While being interviewed after defeating Australian surfer Bede Durbidge at the Quiksilver New York Pro (Long Beach, New York), he blasted officials and surfers advocating for a new ranking system during a publicly broadcast interview. Martinez had been a long-time critic of the ASP's controversial rankings system, but his profane rant—streamed on beachside big screens and live over the Internet broadcast—left event organisers and ASP officials furious. He was immediately disqualified from the event and suspended indefinitely pending an ASP rules committee meeting. He retired from professional competition before the ASP arrived at a final disciplinary decision. Martinez has stated that had he earned a solid result in New York, and that he had intended to compete at Ocean Beach, San Francisco and at Pipeline, but that he had no intention of competing at Trestles or continuing to travel or chase the tour. In the weeks after the incident, Martinez launched a barrage of incendiary tweets against former teammates and ASP officials. He explained the incident as his way of making light of the situation and venting about longstanding frustrations with industry personalities and institutions, in particular his former sponsor Reef.  Notable victories  * Billabong Pro, Teahupoo, Tahiti (2006, 2009) * Billabong Pro, Mundaka, Basque Country (2006, 2007) Personal life Bobby Martinez is of Mexican descent. He married his wife Cleo, who is Australian, in February 2009. They have one daughter. Martinez is an avid recreational boxer and trains regularly at Santa Barbara gyms, including Primo Boxing Club on the Eastside. On June 7, 2012, Martinez signed on with the now-closed Homegrown Surf Shop in Ventura, after finding out that the owner was his long- lost cousin. He was also briefly sponsored by now-defunct brand FTW. He retains sponsorship by Monster Energy Drink and Channel Islands Surfboards.

As a student he was a part of the establishment of Mot Dag. When cooperation between Mot Dag and the Norwegian Communist Party came to an end in 1929, he stayed in the Communist Party. He became a Supreme Court advocate in 1933 and judicial consultant for the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions in 1936. In 1940 he went with the government in exile to London, but came back to Oslo in June. He contributed strongly to the prevention of the Nasjonal Samling's attempt to gain control of the Confederation of Trade Unions. Harald Berntsen. Viggo Hansteen Norsk biografisk leksikon Hansteen was executed on 10 September 1941 during the state of martial law which followed the so-called Milk Strike (Melkestreiken). The reason for the strike was that food supplies had become increasingly worse by September 1941. Also executed at that same time was labour activist Rolf Wickstrøm, who was the union steward and chairman for the union workers at the Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk in Oslo. Hansteen and Wickstrøm were the first two Norwegian citizens executed by the German officials during the five-year occupation of Norway (1940-1945).

Clark David Lytle Clark (26 September 1864 - 3 February 1939) was an Irish entrepreneur who founded the D. L. Clark Company confectioners in 1886 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, now part of Pittsburgh. He was born in County Londonderry, Ireland, the son of Samuel and Jane Clark. He had come to the U.S. with his family from Ireland when he was eight years old, and educated in the public schools. He began making candy in a one-room location in Allegheny City at the age of 19, and later expanded into making gum when learning in 1886 of a new approach using chicle. This he would use bright food coloring and flavor it with extracts of woodland leaves he had chewed as a boy. He is best known for his creation of the D. L. Clark Company, a confectionary, and for creating some of its best known products, including the Clark bar and the Zagnut, as well as for its spinoff, the Clark Chewing Gum Company with its Clark's Teaberry gum. Clark also served as president of several additional candy companies in the region: the Youngstown Candy Company, Steubenville's LaBelle Candy Company, McKeesport's Jewell Candy Company, and the Fayette Candy Company of Uniontown, also being co-owner of the Beaver Falls Model Candy Company. He would also serve as director of McKeesport's First National Bank. He was also a freemason. At the time of his death, in his sleep of heart disease in 1939, he was called 'Pittsburgh's candy king'. He married twice, first to Martha Snitzer, the mother of his 13 children, of which 6 sons and 6 daughters survived him. Following Martha's death, he would remarry to her sister, Carrie Snitzer. His children all shared in inheriting the D. L. Clark Company, before selling it in 1955 to Beatrice Foods.

The plant, which has white lace-like flower clusters, is native to the Nile River Valley. Uses In Egypt around 2000 B.C., the juice of Ammi majus was rubbed on patches of vitiligo after which patients were encouraged to lie in the sun. In the 13th century, vitiligo was treated with a tincture of honey and the powdered seeds of a plant called \\"aatrillal,\\" which was abundant in the Nile River Valley. The plant has since been identified as A. majus but the trade name Aatrillal is still used today to refer to the yellowish-brown powder made from its seeds. Ammi majus contains significant amounts of both bergapten and xanthotoxin (also known as methoxsalen), two psoralen derivatives well known for their photosensitizing effects. Indeed, A. majus may well be the world's major source of methoxsalen. The practice of using Ammi majus to treat vitiligo implicitly acknowledges the hyperpigmentation effects caused by exposure to a photosensitizing agent (such as methoxsalen) followed by ultraviolet radiation. An excess of either the photosensitizing agent or subsequent UV exposure can lead to phytophotodermatitis, a serious skin inflammation. Despite this danger, A. majus is cultivated for its furanocoumarins, which are still used for the treatment of skin disease. Cultivation Like its close relative Ammi visnaga, A. majus and its cultivars are frequently seen in gardens where they are grown from seed annually. The species and the cultivar 'Graceland' have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

The diocese comprises the entirety of the French overseas department of Guadeloupe, one of the Leeward Lesser Antilles. It is also responsible for parishes in the small overseas departments of Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin. The diocese is a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Fort-de-France, and both are members of the Antilles Episcopal Conference. Its cathedral, dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe (the island's eponymous 'Mexican' patron saint), which has the status of a minor basilica, is hence known as the Basilique-Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Guadeloupe de Basse-Terre or the Basse-Terre Cathedral.  History  It was erected in 1850, as the Diocese of Guadeloupe and Basse-Terre, on territory split off from the then Apostolic Prefecture of Îles de la Terre Ferme (an Antillian missionary jurisdiction, which was promoted to diocese of Martinique and meanwhile became the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Fort-de-France), its present Metropolitan. The bishopric was renamed in 1951 to the present name, Diocese of Basse-Terre.

The JECOKE troop went on tour through Kenya, Uganda, Congo Brazzaville, Belgian Congo, and Cameroon, with great success, due to their ' dance. A music contest was organized in Leopoldville in 1956. The winner was JECOKE, who beat out famed local artists such as Wendo Kolosoy, Grand Kalle and Franco to win. The day before the Independence of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Masengo decided to go to Nairobi, Kenya, where he was to make several productions with such great stars as Miriam Makeba of South Africa. Donat Muya, chief of the Lubumbashi National Museum, says that Masengo went to meet Harry Belafonte in Kingston, Jamaica . They sang Masengo's compositions as a duet, and this new fame opened the door for Masengo to get contracts to endorse the products of such firms as Coca- Cola, Ford, and Shell. However, Edouard Masengo did not forget his roots in Katanga. He returned there often to visit fellow musicians Losla Abelo and Mwenda wa Bayeke (Jean-Bosco Mwenda).

They have some localized names that have been used by the indigenous people such as in Amazonas where they are called inambu-pixuna, and in Pará, Brazil where they are called nambu-sujo. Also, throughout their range they are called inhambu-preto. Cinereous tinamous have been around for many centuries. They are part of the oldest families of the world today and have fossils discovered dating back tens of millions of years. Their quick reflexes play a role in their ability to survive. Taxonomy The cinereous tinamou is a monotypic species. All tinamous are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Gmelin originally placed this bird in the Tetrao genus, as Tetrao cinereus, which is indicative of its apparent, but incorrect, closeness to the other game birds. Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. Kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) The term cinereous describes its colouration. Description The cinereous tinamou is a shy and secretive Tinamou. It is approximately in length, and the male bird weighs around and the female of the species weighs . It is colored similar to the Berlepsch's tinamou in that it is dark brown to sooty brown or brownish black in coloration. It tends to be a tad more brown than the Berlepsch's tinamou. It is recognized by its smoky-grey with reddish-brown crown and nape. The feather shafts on side of its head are white, which shows through on occasion. Their color helps them blend with the environment making it harder for predators to detect them. The under parts of the bird are only slightly paler than the body, and the legs appear a dull orange to yellow. They have a light-colored eye ring. Their bill has a dark upper mandible and a yellow lower mandible. In general, their bill is very similar to the Berlpesch's tinamou's except it trends smaller and thinner. The females are generally slightly larger in size then the males. Behavior The cinereous tinamou is diurnal. When they are frightened or surprised they usually run off very quickly. Their instincts have adapted to act quickly since they live their lives on the ground and have to flee quickly to avoid predators so they are rarely seen by humans. They have a tendency to walk or run rather than to fly. They are capable of flight, but it is unusual and short. While the cinereous tinamou may only be in flight for a short duration, their flight is strong and direct. They tend to occur either alone or in pairs, and generally do not travel in groups. =Voice= The cinereous tinamou is specially known to be easy to hear, but very difficult to see. It has a loud distinctive whistle heard mainly at dawn and dusk. Their whistles have a unique pitch and last almost two seconds between each whistle. Their whistles are mostly heard at dawn and dusk, and are monosyllabic. The bird is very capable of projecting its voice to seem like it came from another direction so hearing them and finding their exact location is very difficult. The call between the males and females are similar but not identical to the human ear. Their space between calls shortens as time progresses, so as to appear as to be speeding up in frequency. =Breeding= The breeding season of the cinereous tinamou is year-round due to the perfect climate that they live in; however there is a period of preferred mating, which is August through October, except in Colombia, where it is in June. Like the majority of the tinamou family, the males practice simultaneous polygyny and the females practice successive polyandry. To initiate courtship, the males will usually call out to attract the females. It is believed that the courtship ritual is similar to that of others in their family. This courtship ritual involves the male lowering their chest to the ground. While doing this, they will stretch their neck forward and raise their posterior. It is believed that this serves a dual purpose, in that it appears that they are larger and thus more attractive to the females, and that they are larger and more dangerous to other males. The cinereous tinamou nest is less a nest and more just a location on the forest floor, sometimes made of some leaves laid on the ground. They do choose a sheltered location, usually near a tree. The female will lay about two eggs in season. These eggs appear salmon violet colored, and are considered very colorful. Over time, the eggs will change color to a dark or sometimes milk chocolate color. The young of cinereous tinamous are capable of moving around when they are hatched to the point that they can almost run as soon as they're hatched. They are dark brown with a reddish speckling. =Food and feeding= The food habits of the cinereous tinamou depend on the season and habitat although they are mostly herbivorous, with a heavy focus on fruit, similar to other members of Crypturellus. In the summer their diet consists of small fruits, seeds, and small invertebrates. The majority of the invertebrates that they eat are ants, mole-crickets, and pentatomids. In the winter time they usually eat a wide variety of seeds or berries collected on the ground, with a focus on the acai berry. They are considered a benefit to the nature for insect pest because of their large insect consumption. When the cinereous tinamou is young it is more dependent on insects than when they become adults. The cinereous tinamou does not scratch for food, but instead looks under leaves or uses its bill to dig. =Movement= The cinereous tinamou is a sedentary species. Habitat The cinereous tinamou lives in a lowland rainforest or swamp forest, up to altitude.BirdLife International (2008) They also live in second growth forest, along with bushy areas with scattered trees. They have been known to take advantage of coffee and cocoa plantations and, on occasion, will utilize savanna. They prefer to live near streams or thick swamp woods. Their preferred habitat is thick, dark, and dense. They are abundant, within the upper Amazon, in the varzea. Range This species is native to southern Colombia, southern Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, northern and western Brazil, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, and northern Bolivia.Clements, J (2007) Within Brazil, it occupies the Amazon Basin south to Mato Grosso and east to Pará. Conservation The IUCN classifies this tinamou as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of . It is considered the most common tinamou in Suriname, and is considered uncommon in Peru. The threat to its existence is similar to that of all forest birds, and that is deforestation and fragmentation of the remaining habitat. It is believed that it loses 14.1-17% of its habitat over 3 generations.

History Storefront in Manhattan The company was founded in 1969. It was acquired by Federated Department Stores in 1981. After Campeau Corporation acquired Federated, they sold The Children's Place to a group led by Joseph Sitt in 1988. They became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange in 1997 under the ticker symbol PLCE. Between 2004 and 2007, the company owned and operated 335 Disney Stores through a subsidiary Hoop Holdings/Hoop Retail Stores LLC. Disney sold the chain for the cost of inventory to Children's Place subsidiary Hoop Holdings plus a 15-year licensing agreement. Mario Ciampi, senior vice president of store development and logistics, was named Hoop/Disney Store North America president. The company agreed to pump $100 million in operation upgrades and remodeling. Under the licensing agreement, a \\"royalty holiday\\" period existed until October 2006 to allow revamping of the stores. The royalty thereafter was 5% of store sales while online sales get Disney a 9% to 10% royalty. Hoop Holdings was able to write off the cost ($48 million) of the equipment and property received in the purchase. Hoops saw progress with its strategy as open stores in 2006 for 11 month saw 15% increase in sales assisted by a better Disney box office results and the Disney Channel hit High School Musical. A store website would be up and running in April 2007. In June 2007, the company began negotiations to sell the rights back to The Walt Disney Company. On March 26, 2008, Hoop Holdings/Hoop Retail Stores LLC and related subsidiaries of TCP that operated Disney Store retail locations filed for bankruptcy.

Elfers as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company, effective January 4, 2010. In the summer of 2013, the store withdrew a T-shirt from the stores with four options for \\"My best subjects\\" including \\"Shopping, Music, Dance and Math.\\" While shopping, music, and dance were checked, math was left unchecked because as the T-shirt stated \\"Nobody’s perfect!\\"http://www.salon.com/2013/08/06/the_worst_shirts_for_girls/ A factory in the Rana Plaza building near Dhaka, Bangladesh that produced Children's Place merchandise collapsed in April 2013, killing 1,134 people. The company then joined Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety along with other North American apparel retailers, and former U.S. Senators George Mitchell and Olympia Snowe. The Alliance's mission is a five-year plan to improve conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories. Operations Children’s Place stores are divided into 6 specific size ranges sections: Big Girls and Big Boys (4-16), Toddler Girls and Toddler Boys (12 months-5T), and Baby Girls and Baby Boys (up to 7 lbs-12 months). Most of The Children’s Place stores are located in and around regional malls, but also include some strip shopping centers, outlets, and street stores. The majority of their stores are small, traditional mall stores, although some Children's Place outlets are in a big box format.

Fossil material assigned to this genus originates from the Yixian Formation in northeastern China, originally dated as late Jurassic but now thought to be approximately 125 million years old, or early Cretaceous in age. Even with its revised age, Archaefructus has been proposed to be one of the earliest known genera of flowering plants. Because of its age, lack of sepals and petals, and the fact that its reproductive organs (carpels and stamens), are produced on an elongate stem rather than condensed into a flower as in modern angiosperms, Archaefructaceae has been proposed as a new basal angiosperm family.Sun, G., Q. Ji, D.L. Dilcher, S. Zheng, K.C. Nixon & X. Wang 2002. Archaefructaceae, a New Basal Angiosperm Family. Science 296(5569): 899–904. An alternative interpretation of the same fossil, however, interprets the elongate stem as an inflorescence rather than a flower, with staminate (male) flowers below and pistillate (female) flower above.Friis, E.M., J.A.

If this interpretation is correct, Archaefructus may not be basal within the angiosperms, rather it may be close to the Nymphaeales or the basal eudicots.

It was written by the liberal white South African journalist Donald Woods, a personal friend of Biko. Donald Woods was forced into exile for attempting to expose the truth surrounding Biko’s death. It was the inspiration for the 1987 film Cry Freedom. Summary Biko covers the life of South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko from the view of his friend Donald Woods. The book is also critical of the white government of South Africa and the Apartheid system. It attacks the mistreatment of blacks and the brutality commonly used by the police. History Biko died on September 12, 1977 while in police custody. The official police report stated that he had died as the result of a hunger strike. But South African journalist Woods, after first seeing the body, was convinced that Biko was beaten to death. Woods had photographs of Biko's body taken and published in his newspaper the Daily Dispatch. Woods was forced to flee for his life after he became targeted by the government for attempting to investigate Biko's death. He fled to the United Kingdom, where he campaigned against apartheid and publicized articles about Biko. Cry Freedom Richard Attenborough's movie Cry Freedom was based on Biko and other articles written by Woods. It stars Denzel Washington as Biko and Kevin Kline as Woods.

This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This has been supported by recent molecular phylogenies. Between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus, with estimates of as many as 100. Incomplete herbarium collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species, or groups of similar species. Attalea species have a long history of human use, and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre. Many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats. Their seeds are animal dispersed, including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna. Description Detail of the crown of Attalea maripa showing leaf arrangement and inflorescences Attalea is a genus of non-spiny palms with pinnately compound leaves—rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern. Species range from large trees with stout stems up to tall to acaulescent palms (ones which lack an aboveground stem). The number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty-five; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves. Inflorescences are large, branched and borne among the leaves. The inflorescence consists of a main axis—the peduncle and the rachis—and a series of smaller branches, the rachillae. The rachillae, which bear the flowers, emerge from the rachis. The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the rachis with the stem. Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers, or are predominantly female with a few male flowers. Fruit usually have two or three seeds, although fewer or more are present in some species, and are usually brown, yellow, orange-brown or purple when mature. Four different types of male flowers exist. On the basis of these flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus. Taxonomy Attalea has been placed in the subfamily Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Attaleinae, together with the genera Allagoptera, Beccariophoenix, Butia, Cocos, Jubaea, Jubaeopsis, Parajubaea, Syagrus, and Voanioala. Within this subtribe, Attalea has been found to be a monophyletic group, and sister to the clade containing Allagoptera, Polyandrococos,Dransfield et al. listed this genus as a synonym of Allagoptera, but Meerow et al. recognised it as a distinct genus in their analysis. Parajubaea, Butia, and Jubaea. Disagreement exists as to whether Attalea should be considered a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano, and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa, although he thought it likely that Ynesa colenda, the only member of that genus, was actually a hybrid. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus. The multigenus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another. Four of the genera—Attalea (in a narrow sense), Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea—correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus. However, a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types, including A. colenda (which Glassman placed in its own genus, Ynesa) and this has been used as an argument for the single-genus approach. The fact that there are several hybrids between species occur that would be considered different genera under Glassman's five- genus system was also used as an argument for placing them in a single genus. Molecular phylogenetic work by Alan Meerow and colleagues concluded that multi-genus approach did not produce monophyletic groups, but treating Attalea as a single genus did. Cintia Freitas and colleagues identified three main clades within the genus based on the nuclear WRKY gene family. The first of these, a group of species from the coastal Atlantic Forest region in Brazil all of which had been placed in Attalea in the narrow sense, they termed the Attale-like clade. This group was a sister to the other two clades. The second group, which they called the Scheelea-like clade, consisted of most of the species formerly placed in Scheelea, together with several that had been placed in Attalea (narrowly defined) and Orbigyna. The third group consisted mainly of species formerly placed in Orbigyna and Maximiliana; they called this the Orbigyna-like clade. Despite the existence of three well-supported clades, Freitas and colleagues concluded that the concept of Attalea as a single genus was best supported by their evidence. =History= The genus Attalea was first described Carl Sigismund Kunth in 1816 based on specimens collected by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland, although older, pre- Linnaean descriptions exist, including Charles Plumier's 1703 description of A. crassispatha. The genus was named for Attalus III Philometor, king of Pergamon, known for his interest in medicinal plants. The type species is A. amygdalina, a Colombian endemic. The genera Maximiliana and Orbignya were described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1826 and 1837 respectively. Scheelea was described by Hermann Karsten in 1857, and Ynesa by Orator F. Cook in 1942. =Species= Attalea crassispatha, a Haitian endemic, is the most geographically isolated species in the genus. Experts disagree about the number of species in the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that as many as 100 species may be in the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species. Taxonomic uncertainty is exacerbated by frequent hybridisation between species. The three recent treatments (Henderson and coauthors, Glassman, and Govaerts and Dransfield) recognised a total of 73 species, but only 20 species are accepted by all of them. The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40. For example, what Andrew Henderson considered a single species, Attalea attaleoides, other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species. Glassman doubted the validity of A. attaleoides as a species, and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A. attaleoides—A. camopiensis, A. degranvillei, A. guianensis and A. maripensis. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman's four species and A. attaleoides. However, Jean-Christophe Pintaud was of the opinion that A. guianensis, A. maripensis and A. attaleoides were all very similar, and thought it likely that they all represented the same species. Another species complex in Attalea includes A. speciosa and related species. Henderson (1995) recognised A. speciosa and A. spectabilis, considering the latter to either be an acaulescent form of A. speciosa or a hybrid between A. microcarpa and it. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted A. spectabilis, but Glassman considered it a dubious taxon. Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors;Balick et al.. 1987, Anderson and Balick 1988 Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of A. speciosa. Glassman also described a fourth member of this group, A. brejinhoensis, and it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield. Reproduction and growth Male inflorescence of Attalea sp. swarming with insects. Attalea sp. – MHNT Attalea species are monoecious—male and female flowers are separate, but are borne by the same plant. Various species have been described as being insect- pollinated, including A. phalerata, while pollination in A. colenda and A. speciosa, has been attributed both to insects and wind. The fruit are animal- dispersed. Seed germination is remote tubular—during germination, as the cotyledon expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed. After germination, the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the aboveground stem. This produces a \\"saxophone shaped\\" belowground portion of the stem. The fact that the shoot tips of Attalea seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire-tolerance. Distribution Species range across the Neotropics from Mexico in the north to Bolivia, Paraguay, and southern Brazil in the south, from low elevations in coastal Brazil to up to above sea level in the Andes. According to Govaerts and coauthors, three species are found in Mexico, four in Central America, and 62 in South America. Three species are present in the Caribbean—two in Trinidad and Tobago, along the southern edge of the region, and one in Haiti. Habitat and ecology Scarlet macaw feeding on Attalea fruit. Attalea includes both large trees and small, acaulescent palms, which occupy a number of different ecological niches. Dense stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape, while smaller species are found in both in the forest understorey and in savannas. Disturbance has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests, the density of large adult A. maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. A. speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A. funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches. The fruit are dispersed by animals; fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by bruchid beetles. Certain species of Attalea have been mentioned as examples of anachronistic species which are adapted for dispersal by now- extinct Pleistocene megafauna. On Maracá Island, Roraima, in the Brazilian Amazon, A. maripa fruit were consumed by tapirs, collared peccaries, deer, and primates. Rodents, including agoutis, fed upon the fruit, and as the fruit availability declined, they fed on the seeds. Other dispersers of Attalea fruit include crested caracaras, which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A. phalerata in the Brazilian Pantanal. Uses Attalea species have a long history of human use. Carbonised Attalea maripa seeds have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP. Several species remain important sources of edible oil, thatch, edible seeds, and fibre. The leaves of Attalea butyracea and A. maripa are used extensively for thatching. Several species are oil palms, with A. speciosa among the most important economically. Products extracted from A. speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households in the Brazilian state of Maranhão in 2005, and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the Brazil. Piassava fibres, extracted from the leaf bases of A. funifera, are commercially important, and generated about US$20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996.

The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo, deals with the aftermath of a fatal car crash. It was released to theaters on October 19, 2007.  Plot  Dwight Arno is an attorney who is divorced from his wife Ruth. Ruth controls custody of their son Lucas while Dwight maintains visitation rights. Dwight and Lucas are at a baseball game when Ruth calls, informing Dwight that he is late returning their son home. Dwight drives Lucas home in a hurry, thinking he might otherwise forfeit his visitation privileges. When he loses control of his vehicle, he strikes a young boy, Josh Learner, who is standing by the roadside. Aware that he has struck the boy, Dwight decides to flee the scene. He further lies to Lucas, who has a minor injury from the incident, saying that they had collided with a tree log. Dwight later hears on a newscast that Josh died in the collision. Subsequently, he tries to cover up the evidence which implicates him in the hit-and-run. After the initial shock, Josh's mother Grace gradually tries to get on with life, but her husband Ethan obsesses over finding the perpetrator. Frustrated with the lack of progress the police are making, Ethan eventually decides to hire a lawyer, who oddly enough turns out to be Dwight. Consumed with guilt, Dwight decides to turn himself in. At the police station he is at the point of confessing, but he does not get the chance. The investigating officer, thinking he has come as Ethan's lawyer, admits that the case is going nowhere and leaves the room before Dwight can say anything else. While picking up his daughter Emma, who has begun taking piano lessons from Ruth, Ethan encounters Dwight again. In anticipation of going to jail later, Dwight asks Ruth to have Lucas for a week stating that it will be the last week for a long time. Sensing desperation, Ruth reluctantly agrees. Ethan eventually discovers the truth and fears that Dwight would be sentenced to only a short time in prison. He buys a gun and arrives at Dwight's house just as Lucas has gone to bed. Dwight begs Ethan to take him outside and spare Lucas the trauma. Ethan forces Dwight into the trunk of his car and lets him out after a short drive. Because of Ethan's emotional state and resulting hesitation, Dwight manages to grab the gun and point it at Ethan. He then points the gun at himself and convinces Ethan that he wishes he had died instead of Josh. Ethan leaves Dwight to deal with his remorse. The film ends with Lucas, by himself, watching a taped confession to the hit-and-run that Dwight had made earlier.

The small sub-divisional town has scenic beauty and is surrounded by hills, tea gardens, forests and the Dihing River. It has a beautiful golf course at the foot of the hills and a small stream running through. Although considered to be a small town, Margherita boasts of many hospitals and educational institutions and is regularly frequented by visitors on account of it being the last proper town of Upper Assam. The name Margherita actually derives from the Italian queen and dates back to the late 19th century as a token appreciation for the Italian Chief Engineer of a rail section Chevalier R Paginini who supervised the construction. Margherita was famous for its collieries much developed by the British. Coal India Ltd has the biggest industrial plant here. The town is also known as Coal Queen as it is famous for coal business. Apart from this there are other industrial plants like Kitply and Tata Tea (amalgamated plantations), along with minor plywood industries and tea gardens.

The name has its roots in the Dehing River Bridge which was built around 1880 by a team led by an Italian Engineer Chevalier Roberto Paganini who worked for the Assam Railways & Trading Company Ltd. From historical records, it is not quite clear whether the directors of that company renamed the place as a lasting tribute to that Italian engineer or was it Paganini himself, out of patriotism, christened the place in honour of Queen Margherita, the reigning Queen Consort of Italy. Religion and festivals The population is a mix of Assamese, Bengali, Nepali, Odiya (this population migrated or were hired to work in the tea gardens) as well as those who migrated from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and other South Indian states to work in the coal mines. A major chunk of the population is Hindus followed by Muslims and Christians. In the interior parts, some people follow Buddhism.

It was named after Glengarry County, Ontario, as the place the first settlers originated from. History The first subdivision plan for the community of Killarney was registered with the Alberta Land Titles Office in 1906, and the lands were formally annexed by the City in 1910. Development before the Second World War was slow; most houses built at the time were one-storey clapboard structures. The community was filled out in the post-war era, when developers erected hundreds of small stucco and clapboard bungalows on the 25- and wide lots. Since approximately 2002, developers have been replacing the older structures with low- and medium-density infill housing on a piecemeal basis. Westbrook Mall, a small regional shopping centre featuring Walmart and Canada Safeway, is located directly north of the community. There are also numerous shops along 17th Avenue, 26th Avenue and 37th Street S.W. The community has an area redevelopment plan in place.

After his arduous experiences in India and the East Indies, he headed the first official embassy from a European nation in China (Portugal, to the Chinese Zhengde Emperor, during the Ming dynasty), where he died. Pires was apothecary to the ill-fated Afonso, Prince of Portugal, son of King John II of Portugal. He went to India in 1511, invested as \\"factor of drugs\\",(Pires 1990:xi) the Eastern commodities that were an important element of what is generally called \\"the spice trade\\". In Malacca and Cochin he avidly collected and documented information on the Malay-Indonesian area, and personally visited Java, Sumatra and Maluku.  The Suma Oriental  From his Malay- Indonesia travels, he wrote a landmark book on Asian trade, the Suma Oriental que trata do Mar Roxo até aos Chins (Summa of the East, from the Red Sea up to the Chinese). He wrote the book in Malacca and India between 1512 and 1515, completing it before the death of Afonso de Albuquerque (December 1515).This is inferred from the tenor of his references to Albuquerque (Pires 1990:lxiii). It is the first European description of the Malay Archipelago and the oldest and most extensive description of the Portuguese East. It is a compilation of a wide variety of information: historical, geographical, ethnographic, botanical, economic, commercial, etc., including coins, weights and measures. Pires was careful to investigate the accuracy of the information collected from merchants, sailors and others with whom he had contact. It shows him to be a discriminating observer, in spite of his tangled prose,\\"His style is far from clear,\\" his modern editor has noted (Pires 1990:lxxiii) \\"and no doubt it often becomes more confused, owing to the transcriber's mistakes.\\" but superior to other Portuguese writers of the time. The book, couched as a report to Manuel of Portugal, and perhaps fulfilling a commission undertaken before he left Lisbon,Armando Cortesão, introduction to Pires 1990:lxxiii is regarded as one of the most conscientious first-hand resources for the study of the geography and trade of the Indies at that time, including one of the most important resources for the study of the contemporaneous Islam in Indonesia.

Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from two Greek roots: (kruptos) meaning ‘covered’ or ‘hidden’ and (oura) meaning ‘tail’; the Latin suffix -ellus is diminutive. Thus, Crypturellus means ‘little hidden tail’.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Description The tepui tinamou is approximately in length. The top of its head and rear of neck are rufous brown, darker on its back, and dusky below with rufous sheen on its upper breast. The sides of its head and throat are grey in color, its upper mandible is black, its lower mandible yellow with black tip, and its legs are olive in color. Behavior Like other tinamous, the tepui eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2–3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range and habitat The tepui tinamou has been found on Ptari- tepuí, Auyán-tepuí, Chimantá-tepuí, and Sororopán-tepuí, in southeastern Bolívar, Venezuela. It was found in between in elevation, and its preferred habitat is tropical moist montane forest or tropical moist shrubland.BirdLife International (2008) Conservation The IUCN classifies it as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

It runs for through the Yakima Canyon, following the meandering Yakima River between Selah and Ellensburg. Both ends of the highway are at interchanges with Interstate 82 (I-82) and U.S. Route 97 (US 97). SR 821 was established in 1973 on the old alignment of US 97, which usurped previous state roads that were part of the Inland Empire Highway. The Yakima Canyon road was constructed in 1924 by the state government to replace a gravel road over the mountains to the west and became popular with tourists. The highway was designated as the Yakima River Canyon Scenic Byway by the state government in 1967 and bypassed five years later by a section of I-82 running uphill to the east. Route description A section of SR 821 in the Yakima River Canyon SR 821 begins at an interchange with I-82, co-signed with US 97, northeast of Selah in northern Yakima County. The interchange also includes a connection to Firing Center Road, which continues east into the Yakima Training Center, a military installation that spans the mountainous area between Yakima and the Columbia River. SR 821 makes a 90-degree turn to the northeast and intersects the northern terminus of SR 823, a short highway that travels south into downtown Selah. The highway continues north through farms near the community of Pomona and passes the Sundown M Ranch substance abuse treatment center near the mouth of Selah Creek at the Yakima River. It then travels into the narrow Yakima River Canyon to the east of BNSF Railway's Yakima Valley Subdivision, which forms part of the main east–west railroad across south central Washington. Near the south end of the Yakima River Canyon, which cuts across the Umtanum Ridge, SR 821 crosses into Kittitas County. The two-lane highway generally runs along the bottom of the canyon, to the east of the river and railroad and paralleled to the east by I-82. At its south end, the highway passes downhill from an earlier alignment that was tunneled under a section of the ridge. At Roza Dam, the railroad crosses over to the west side of the river while SR 821 stays uphill from the river, cutting through part of the ridge. The highway continues north, following the cliffs along the meandering river and opposite the railroad and the Wenas Wildlife Area to the west. It passes through of land owned by the Bureau of Land Management, which includes several campgrounds, boat launches, and four recreational areas. The area also has several cattle ranches and farms centered around the Burbank Valley. Midway through the valley, SR 821 passes the Canyon River Ranch, an isolated rest area with shops, restaurants, and cabins that is planned to grow into a resort. Further north of the ranch is the parking lot for the Umtanum Creek Recreation Area, with a network of hiking trails connected via a footbridge over the Yakima River. After completing a series of hairpin turns along the narrowest section of the valley, SR 821 is rejoined by the railroad and enters the wide Kittitas Valley near several vineyards. The highway turns east at Helen McCabe State Park onto Thrall Road and crosses Wilson Creek before terminating at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-82 and US 97. From the junction, Canyon Road continues north along the railroad to an interchange with I-90 and into downtown Ellensburg. SR 821 is designated as the Yakima River Canyon Scenic Byway by the state government, recognizing its natural beauty and recreational opportunities. The byway is visited by 1.1 million drivers annually, of which a third visit recreational areas and campgrounds along the route. The canyon was formed approximately 10 million years ago through the erosion of rocks formed by basalt lava flows. The byway passes through shrub-steppe habitats that are home to trout, bighorn sheep, mule deer, and a variety of visiting or permanent bird species. An interpretive center for the byway was planned to be constructed at Helen McCabe State Park at the north entrance of the byway, using funding from the county government and the Federal Highway Administration, but was cancelled in 2015. SR 821 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. The highway's daily vehicle counts range from a minimum of 1,100 vehicles at its northern terminus to a maximum of 5,100 at its southern terminus. SR 821 generally consists of two lanes with a width of , with occasional shoulders, and a posted speed limit of . Sections of the highway are closed for day-long events that are held annually, including a cattle drive in January or February, a marathon and bicycle tour in the spring, and a heritage tractor run in the summer. History A photograph of the gravel-paved Canyon Highway, taken by Asahel Curtis in 1924 The Yakima River Canyon was historically avoided by Native Americans and later American settlers, who preferred wagon trails along nearby ridges and creeks. One of the main routes across the Umtanum Ridge was a toll road constructed in the 1880s by Jacob Durr through the Wenas Valley and Shushuskin Canyon, west of the canyon route. The toll road was bypassed by the Northern Pacific Railway in 1885, using a route along the west side of the river that was rejected for road construction due to a lack of space. A road link between Ellensburg and Yakima remained a priority for the state government, who appropriated funds in 1909 to survey the area for a potential state highway. It was named as part of the planned Inland Empire Highway in 1913, forming a major trunk route through the Yakima Valley and Inland Northwest, and a route along the east side of the river was surveyed in the early 1920s by state highway engineers. Construction on the graded highway, using a surface of crushed rocks, through the Yakima Canyon began in 1920 and was completed on September 12, 1924. It cost approximately $1 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars) and included several tunnels cut through the lava basalt cliffs using dynamite that were later abandoned. The highway was signed as part of State Road 3 and incorporated into the Yellowstone Trail, a national auto trail, and later the federal numbered highway system created in 1926. Under the federal system, the Ellensburg–Yakima section formed part of US 97, the main north–south route through central Washington and Oregon. The highway was paved with concrete in 1932 and renumbered as Primary State Highway 3 (PSH 3) in 1937. The canyon highway's tunnels were bypassed by a new alignment built closer to the river in 1963, after traffic volumes had outgrown the narrow tunnels. I-82 was completed east of the canyon over Manastash Ridge in November 1971, bypassing the congested highway through the Yakima River Canyon. The canyon route had been designated as the state's first scenic byway in 1967, following the enactment of the system, and was provisionally numbered and signed as State Route 821. A lower speed limit of was also set on the highway to discourage use by trucks and encourage scenic touring. In 1973, US 97 was rerouted onto I-82 between Ellensburg and Yakima, while the old alignment through the canyon became SR 821. Until the completion of the Thrall Road interchange in the 1980s, SR 821 continued further north to Tjossem Road, where it turned east and crossed I-82. The encroachment of residential development from the north forced the Bureau of Land Management and The Nature Conservancy to buy additional properties in the canyon for preservation in the 1990s. Beginning in 1996, the state government embarked on a targeted anti- drunk driving campaign along SR 821, which had been the site of over 115 collisions between 1992 and 1995, of which 25 were alcohol-related. The first year of the campaign was hailed as a success, with two consecutive summer months without a recorded collision and 2,200 police stops for driving violations. Eight separate sections of the highway were closed for several weeks in July 1998 due to rockslides and washouts brought by of rainfall on July 3. The repair cost $750,000 and used funds from the Federal Highway Administration, acquired via an emergency proclamation signed by Governor Gary Locke.

It was first found in humans in 1913. A 1990 study has indicated that the terminal nerve is a common finding in the adult human brain. The nerve has been called unofficially by other names, including cranial nerve XIII, zero nerve, nerve N, and NT. Structure The original images (1878) of Fritsch's dogfish shark brain showing the nerve marked by an asterisk. The terminal nerve appears just anterior of the other cranial nerves bilaterally as a microscopic plexus of unmyelinated peripheral nerve fascicles in the subarachnoid space covering the gyrus rectus. This plexus appears near the cribriform plate and travels posteriorly toward the olfactory trigone, medial olfactory gyrus, and lamina terminalis. The nerve is often overlooked in autopsies because it is unusually thin for a cranial nerve, and is often torn out upon exposing the brain. Careful dissection is necessary to visualize the nerve. Its purpose and mechanism of function is still open to debate; consequently, nerve zero is often not mentioned in anatomy textbooks. =Development= The zebrafish was used as a developmental model in research from 2004. The connections between the terminal nerve and the olfactory system have been extensively studied in human embryos. It was found to enter the brain at stages 17 and 18 from olfactory origins. Function Although very close to (and often confused for a branch of) the olfactory nerve, the terminal nerve is not connected to the olfactory bulb, where smells are analyzed. This fact suggests that the nerve is either vestigial or may be related to the sensing of pheromones. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the terminal nerve projects to the medial and lateral septal nuclei and the preoptic areas, all of which are involved in regulating sexual behavior in mammals, as well as a 1987 study finding that mating in hamsters is reduced when the terminal nerve is severed.

Composition and responsibilities General Synod debate, Halifax 2010Except in special instances when it may be called into session by the Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada or the Council of General Synod, the General Synod meets triennially at locations across Canada. The Synod next meets in 2019 in Vancouver, British Columbia.

All bishops and archbishops of the ACC are members of General Synod; clergy and lay delegates are elected from each of the church's thirty dioceses, as well as the Canadian Forces and the religious orders. Unlike the Church of England or the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Orders are not divided into Houses which meet separately according to different rules of order. Nonetheless, voting may be done by Orders with respect to certain issues, or on demand according to the rules of order, under which conditions a given Resolution would need to be approved in all three. The General Synod is responsible for articulating the doctrine, discipline, and worship of the Anglican Church of Canada. During its regular meetings, which generally span a week to nine days, members exchange information, set policy for the church, pass resolutions, and enact and amend canon law. Presently, there are twenty-two numbered canons, dealing with issues as prosaic as the name of the church, to ones touching on doctrine, such as matrimony and Holy Orders, to judicial disciplinary proceedings. Officers of General Synod and the Council of General Synod General Synod elects three of the nine officers who maintain certain executive responsibilities at and between Synods. Of those, one - the Primate - holds office until he or she resigns, is removed, retires, or dies. The other officers, elected at each General Synod, are the Prolocutor and the Deputy Prolocutor. The Prolocutor acts as the chief deputy to the Primate, and the second executive officer of General Synod. As such, he chairs sessions of General Synod and meetings of the Council of General Synod in the absence of the Primate. The current Prolocutor is Cynthia Haines Turner; the Deputy Prolocutor is Peter Wall. =Council of General Synod= Between sessions of General Synod, the Council of General Synod (COGS) administers the affairs of the ACC. COGS is composed of the Primate, the Prolocutor, the Deputy Prolocutor, the Chancellor, and representatives from the three Orders from each of the four ecclesiastical provinces, chosen by the respective delegates at General Synod, the numbers of which vary according to a complicated electoral formula. COGS appoints four of the nine officers of General Synod: * The General Secretary * The Treasurer * The Chancellor * The Vice-Chancellor, if appointed It also elects two Officers-at-large (one Clergy, one Laity). Committees of General Synod General Synod has six standing committees, consisting of members both elected at General Synod and appointed by the Primate: * Faith, Worship and Ministry Committee: Responsible for liturgical issues; * Partners in Mission Committee: Responsible for relationships with Anglican and ecumenical churches and organisations overseas; * Eco-Justice Committee: Responsible for social and environmental issues; * Pension Committee: Responsible for clergy and staff pension administration; * Financial Management and Development Committee: Responsible for the ACC's financial affairs; * Communications and Information Resources Committee: Responsible for the communications and publications of the ACC, including the Anglican Journal newspaper.

Schönfeldts Gränd (Swedish: \\"Alley of Schönfeldt\\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching south-west from Stora Nygatan to Mälartorget it is crossed by Lilla Nygatan and Munkbrogatan, and forms a parallel street to Kåkbrinken and Lejonstedts Gränd. Before the street names of the old town were revised in 1885, the part east of Lilla Nygatan was known as Schönfeldts gränd, while the western part was called Prechtens gränd (\\"Alley of [the] Precht\\"). History The name Prechtens gränd is composed of the German surname Precht with a definite article suffix added to it, and refers to the German-born court sculptor Buchardt Precht (1651–1738) whose workshop was located on the corner to Lilla Nygatan. A map dated 1733, probably erroneously, labels the street Prechtris gr[änd]; the same section in 1737 referred to as Badstugugårds eller Prechtens gränd (\\"Bathhouse Homestead or...\\"); and a guide in 1820 names it Prectens gr[änd]. Schönfeldts gränd refers to Greger von Schönfeldt (1625-1675), judge at the board of trade, who bought the palace built by Lennart Torstensson (1603–1651) north of the alley between Lilla and Stora Nygatan in 1674. He died before the palace was completed, but his wife and family could finally move in during 1680. Later proprietors include, the president of the Privy Council Arvid Bernhard Horn (1664–1742), who took possession of the palace through his wife Inga Törnflycht; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences who bought the property in 1778; Jernkontoret, trade association of the Swedish steel industry; Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB moved in 1820; and from the 1960s it is the HQ of Moderata Samlingspartiet, the Swedish liberal conservative party.

It consists of: * five Bregović-composed songs that were never previously released or recorded. They were recorded specifically for this album with Zdenka Kovačiček, Bisera Veletanlić, Jadranka Stojaković (2 songs), and Milić Vukašinović on vocal * two already released Bijelo dugme songs (arranged in a slightly different manner this time and re-recorded with Jadranka Stojaković, and Zdravko Čolić on vocals, respectively, instead of the band's singer at the time Željko Bebek), * four Bebek-sung tracks, recorded 4 years earlier in 1972 during Bijelo dugme's previous incarnation as Jutro.

The airport has two runways, and it is used as a civilian airport and is co-located next to Chiayi Air Base. Chiayi Airport is envisioned as a gateway to the Alishan National Scenic Area, a popular tourist destination in Taiwan. Opened in 1976, Chiayi Airport was one of the airports in Taiwan that were severely affected by the opening of the Taiwan High Speed Rail in 2007. Uni Air is the sole operator of scheduled flights to the airport. Although listed as an international airport by the Taiwanese government, the joint use of Chiayi Airport's facilities by the Republic of China Air Force and the lack of complete customs and immigration facilities at the airport restricts the use of the airport by international flights. As such, the airport has no scheduled international flights; it is only served internationally by occasional chartered flights. History A departure lounge was completed on the grounds of Chiayi Air Base on 19 May 1976, marking the start of operations at Chiayi Airport. China Airlines launched the inaugural flight, providing trice-weekly flights between Taipei and Chiayi. Due to the growth in passenger numbers at the airport, a terminal building was built in 1977 and opened on 1 January 1978. In 1990, Great China Air took over China Airlines' route at Chiayi Airport. At the same time, it also launched flights to Kinmen Airport and Penghu Airport. TransAsia Airways, Far Eastern Air Transport and Formosa Airlines all launched flights at Chiayi Airport between 1994 and 1996. Meanwhile, Chiayi Airport's terminal was expanded and refurbished in 1995 to handle the increased number of passengers using the airport. In 1995, the airport served over a million passengers for the first time. The airport was reclassified as a B-class airport in 1996. However, in 1999, the number of services to Chiayi Airport decreased when Formosa Airlines withdrew from its operations at Chiayi Airport in the aftermath of an air crash over Hsinchu. This was followed by the successive withdrawals of Far Eastern Air Transport and TransAsia Airways in 2001 and 2002 respectively due to poor load factors caused by a slowing local economy. These withdraws left Uni Air, the successor of Great China Air, as the only operator of flights at Chiayi Airport. With the launch of the Taiwan High Speed Rail in 2007, which links Chiayi to Taipei, demand for flights between Taipei and Chiayi declined significantly. This forced Uni Air to cancel its twice-daily flights between Taipei and Chiayi in August 2015. The Taiwanese Government gave Chiayi Airport an \\"International Airport\\" status in December 2012 in a bid to boost local tourism. Chiayi Airport was subsequently added to the list of airports where direct cross-straits flights between China and Taiwan are allowed in 2013. A series of charter flights between Chiayi and Shizuoka Airport was launched by China Airlines that year, making them the first international flight from Chiayi Airport. This was followed by the launch of the first direct flight between Chiayi and a Mainland Chinese airport, a charter flight by Spring Airlines to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, in May 2014. Facilities Chiayi Airport has an elevation of 85 feet (26 metres). It has two parallel runways, designated 18R/36L and 18L/36R respectively. 18R/36L measures 3050 metres by 45 metres (10007 feet by 148 feet) and is made of concrete, while the shorter 18L/36R asphalt runway measures 1618 metres by 23 metres (5307 feet by 74 feet). Only runway 18R/36L is equipped with an instrument landing system. The runways and taxiways facilities at Chiayi Airport are shared with Chiayi Air Base. Chiayi Airport has 3 aircraft stands that are capable of accommodating aircraft types such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-90 and ATR 72. Its 1,717-square metre terminal has a capacity of 222,000 a year, while its 45-square metre cargo facility is able to handle 19,035 tonnes of cargo annually. The airport has limited customs and immigration facilities that allows the airport to handle international flights.

The instrument derives its name from previous owners Seymour Solomon, co-founder of Vanguard Records, and British violinist, Dorothy Mary Murray Lambert The Solomon, ex-Lambert comes from Stradivari's mature period and, retains the bold outline, superb arching and quality materials which account for the power, sonority and tonal balance his work is recognized for. Provenance The first recorded owner of the Solomon, Ex-Lambert Stradivarius was Berlin dealer and expert who sold it to ‘Miss Price’, a student of the violin studying in Berlin at the time. From Price the violin passed to the venerable English collector Robert Bower, one of the preeminent connoisseurs of his day who owned no fewer than twenty-four Stradivari instruments. By 1922 the violin was sold through the London dealers of John and Arthur Beare to Ernest E. Winterbotham who paid GB£1,600 and presented the violin to his wife Dorothy Mary Murray Lambert. Known as Miss Murray Lambert, she was among the few British women of the 1920s and 1930s who pursued a career as a concert violinist. A student of both Carl Flesch and Leopold Auer she was a champion of British contemporary composers and a prolific performer of the works of Sir Hamilton Harty. It is said that her performances of the Violin Sonata No.1 by Frederick Delius inspired the artist Hugh Riviere R.A. (1869–1956) to create his final full-length portrait, Delius Sonata. By the late 1930s Lambert withdrew from the concert stage to concentrate on teaching which she pursued through the 1950s. Following Lambert's death the violin was offered at auction in 1972 as “The Property of Miss Murray Lambert,” selling for GB£17,500 to Seymour Solomon. On 23 February 2007 a demonstration performance of the Solomon, Ex-Lambert by violinist Ruth Palmer was held for the press launch for the auction by Christie's. The violin sold for US$2.728 million on 2 April 2007 to an anonymous bidder represented by violin buying agent Ric Heinl. See also *Stradivarius References 2\\\\.

Cornwall was born at Ashcroft House, in Newington Bagpath, near Wotton-under- Edge, Gloucestershire, England in 1836, son of the Reverend Alan Gardner Cornwall, the Anglican rector of Owlpen and Newington Bagpath, and Caroline Kingscote, of Kingscote, Gloucestershire.Owlpen archives: Memoir of Parson Cornwall Both Cornwall's parents, though untitled, were able to trace their family lineages in England back as far as the Norman Conquest of 1066. After childhood education in private schools, Cornwall went to Trinity College, Cambridge but transferred to Magdalene College, Cambridge, graduating in 1858 with a Bachelor of Arts. He was called to the bar by the Society of the Inner Temple, London in 1862, but that same year he departed for and arrived in British Columbia. Unlike nearly all others newly arrived in the colony, and despite touring the mining districts, Cornwall made no effort to pursue mining, choosing instead to focus on stock-raising and the legal profession. He spent time at his seasonal practice as lawyer at Wild Horse Creek, French Creek and in the Big Bend. In 1864 Cornwall was elected to represent the Hope- Yale-Lytton riding for the newly created colonial Legislative Assembly , and was also a member of the same body in 1871 during the period in which British Columbia joined Canadian confederation. Immediately after the new province entered Confederation, Cornwall was appointed to the Canadian senate and served in that capacity for ten years until accepting the invitation in 1881 to serve as Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia. He had been appointed a provincial Justice of the Peace in 1864 and continued in that capacity until April, 1885; he retired from the office of Lieutenant-Governor in 1887 . He was engaged in \\"rural pursuits\\" – the life of a gentleman rancher – from the time of his retirement until September 17, 1889, when he was appointed to the bench as Judge of the County Court of Cariboo, also receiving the title of Stipendiary Magistrate in the same year. He continued in that position until retiring to Victoria in 1906. Cornwall was a member of many agricultural and pioneer societies, including the Dominion Council of Agriculture. In partnership with his brother Henry P. Cornwall, he managed a ranching operation which for many years was the province's largest supplier of livestock. Their cattle ranch near the confluence of the Bonaparte and Thompson Rivers was named for Cornwall's birthplace as Ashcroft Manor; the township as Ashcroft. The ranch also operated a gristmill, a sawmill, and a roadhouse. Both Cornwalls were avid proponents of \\"gentlemen's sports\\", especially horse-racing and fox-hunting. The Ashcroft Manor Ranch was memorable for its hunting parties, with Cornwall's select group of foxhounds, from the Duke of Beaufort's celebrated kennels, put in hot pursuit of the local coyotes instead of foxes, and lavish social entertainments for any guests visiting during the hunt. Ashcroft became one of the main horse-racing venues in the province at a time when that was the number-one sport, and Cornwall took a prominent part in their organization. In due course he became president of the British Columbia Jockey Club. The Cornwall Hills and Cornwall Creek, in the vicinity of the ranch, which was also known as the Cornwall Ranch, derive their name from the Cornwall brothers. Cornwall, who was a member of the Church of England, was married to Charlotte Pemberton, daughter of the Reverend A.G. Pemberton of Kensal Green, London.

It is an exclusively coastal species and is not found more than 10 km (6 mi) away from land. This species is related to the reed cormorant, and was formerly considered to the same species. Distribution It is found from Cape Agulhas north to Swakopmund along the coast of southern Africa. The population appears to be between 2500 and 2900 breeding pairs. It breeds in small groups, with fewer than 150 individuals per colony being typical. Ringing recoveries show that juveniles may disperse up to 277 km from their nests, and adults move between breeding sites over 500 km apart. Description The crowned cormorant is 50–55 cm in length. Adults are black with a small crest on the head and a red face patch. Young birds are dark brown above, paler brown below, and lack the crest. They can be distinguished from immature reed cormorants by their darker underparts and shorter tail. Behavior Crowned cormorants feed on slow-moving fish and invertebrates, which they forage for in shallow coastal waters and among kelp beds. It builds a nest from kelp, sticks, bones and lines it with kelp or feathers. The nest is usually in an elevated position such as a rocks, trees or man-made structures, but may be built on the ground. Conservation Threats to the species include predation of eggs and chicks by kelp gulls and great white pelicans, human disturbance, oiling, and commercial fishing activities, including entanglement in marine debris and plastic fishing gear.

In late May 2019, Taiwanese carrier, Uni Air has announced that they will be officially ending flights from Taipei Songshan Airport to Hengchun after they suspended flights from Taipei Songshan Airport to Hengchun back in September 2014. History The airport construction was finished in 2003 and opened to public in January 2004 with a cost of NT$539,000,000. However, since the opening of Taiwan High Speed Rail in 2007, there has been a sharp decline in the number of passengers using the airport. Since August 2014 until today, the airport has not processed any passenger. In 2014 alone, the airport only served around 768 passengers, down from 23,000 passengers in its inaugural year of 2004. In October 2015, the Civil Aeronautics Administration announced that they will make a decision whether to close the airport in the second half of 2016 due to the extremely low passenger rate.

Hugh had two older brothers Jonathon and Edward along with younger brothers Irvin, Lambi and James along with younger sisters Lavinia and Una. = Early career = Mulzac's life at sea started immediately after high school when he served on British schooners. He was sent to Swansea Nautical College in Wales to train for his ship masters license. In 1918, Hugh Mulzac emigrated to the United States. Within two years he had earned his shipping master's certificate, the first ever issued to an African American. He joined with Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and served as a Captain on the SS Yarmouth of the Black Star Line. However, disagreements with the UNIA lead to his resignation in 1921. For the next two decades, the only shipboard work Mulzac could get was in the steward's departments on several shipping lines. =World War II= In 1942, Mulzac was offered command of the SS Booker T. Washington, the first Liberty ship to be named after an African-American. He refused at first because the crew was to be all black. He insisted on an integrated crew, stating, \\"Under no circumstances will I command a Jim Crow\\", and the authorities relented. With this, he became famous for being the first ever black captain, the first black man to obtain a ships masters license and the first black man ever to command a fully integrated vessel. Under his command, over 18,000 troops were transported around the world, and additionally \\"carrying vital war supplies such as tanks, aircraft and ammunition to the European front.\\" Captain Hugh Mulzac also played a role in the National Maritime Union. The Union included a clause that stipulated that there should be no discrimination based on color, race, political creed, religion or national origin.Captain Mulzac and his crew in England after the maiden voyage of the SS Booker T.

In 1950 he made a bid for Queens Borough President under the American Labor Party ticket. He lost the election, having gotten 15,500 votes. Due to his strong ties to the labor movement, he found himself blacklisted in the era of McCarthyism. At the New York state election, 1958, he ran on the Independent-Socialist ticket for New York State Comptroller. Mulzac was a self-taught painter, and in 1958, thirty-two of his oil paintings were put on exhibit at one man show in the Countee Cullen Library in Manhattan. In 1960 a Federal Judge restored his seaman's papers and license, and at the age of 74 he was able to find work as a night mate.

The 154th served in France on the Western Front, then after the 1918 Armistice with Germany was demobilized in 1919. Members of the 154th Observation Squadron, 1925 The Militia Act of 1903 established the present National Guard system, units raised by the states but paid for by the Federal Government, liable for immediate state service. If federalized by Presidential order, they fall under the regular military chain of command. On 1 June 1920, the Militia Bureau issued Circular No.1 on organization of National Guard air units.ANG Chronology 1908-2007, see also Brief History of the Minnesota Air National Guard and the 133rd Airlift Wing, 1. The unit was reorganized with the establishment of a permanent air service in 1920 as the 154th Observation Squadron on 24 October 1925, and is oldest unit of the Arkansas Air National Guard. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The 154th Observation Squadron was activated for one year of training on 16 September 1940. The unit completed its one-year training and returned to state control, but was recalled to active duty on 7 December 1941 as a result of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units. Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 The modern Arkansas ANG received federal recognition on 27 May 1946 as the 154th Fighter Squadron at Adams Field, Little Rock. It was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of the state. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Arkansas Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. On 2 October 1950, the 154th Fighter Squadron, along with detachment B, 237th Air Services Group and the 154th Utility Flight reported to active duty for service in Korea. The unit went to Langley Air Force Base, VA where it was re-equipped with the F-84E fighter and completed transition training. The 154th flew its first combat sortie 2 May 1951. Initially operating out of Itaeke, Japan the unit later moved to Taegu, Korea. The 154th returned to Arkansas and was relieved from active duty 1 July 1952. While in Korea the 154th flew 3,790 combat sorties and was awarded the Presidential Korean Citation for its service Arkansas National Guard Museum, Facebook Page, Today in History.

On 22 August 1962, the 184th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 188th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was established by the National Guard Bureau with the 184th TRS becoming the group's flying squadron. On 1 October, the 154th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 189th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was allotted by the National Guard Bureau, extended federal recognition and activated. Following the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Arkansas had been activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle air defense overflights of major United States cities. Additionally, Arkansas ANG units had been deployed overseas as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. Today, the 189th Airlift Wing at Little Rock AFB is home to the most experienced C-130 instructor cadre in the world. Since 1998, the primary mission of the 189 AW has been to teach the C-130 Instructor School curriculum for pilots, navigators, flight engineers, and loadmasters. Students include aircrew members from all branches of the DoD, Coast Guard, and many foreign countries.

This implies that other benefits the father can offer the mother or offspring are less relevant than they may appear, including his capacity as a parental caregiver, territory and any nuptial gifts. Fisher's principle means that the sex ratio (except in certain eusocial insects) is always near 1:1 between males and females, yet what matters most are her \\"sexy sons'\\" future breeding successes, more likely if they have a promiscuous father, in creating large numbers of offspring carrying copies of her genes.

Princeton Univ Press, Princeton, NJ. In 1915, Ronald Fisher wroteFisher, Ronald A. \\"The evolution of sexual preference.\\" The Eugenics Review 7, no. 3 (1915): 184. that > Granted that while this taste and preference prevails among the females of > the species, the males will grow more and more elaborate and beautiful tail > feathers, the question must be answered \\"Why have the females this taste?

So that in selecting a mate from a number of different > competitors, it is important to select that one which is most likely to > produce successful children. In 1976, prior to Weatherhead and Robertson's paper, Richard Dawkins had written in his book The Selfish Gene: Ronald Fisher's principle, as published in his book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, is one of several possible explanations for the highly diverse and often astonishing ornaments of animals.Geoffrey Miller (2000). The Mating Mind. Anchor Books, a division of Random House, Inc. (First Anchor Books Edition, April 2001). New York, NY. Anchor If females choose physically attractive males, they will tend to get physically attractive sons, and, thus more grandchildren, because other choosy females will prefer their attractive, sexy sons. The theory will function regardless of the physical or behavioral trait a female chooses, as long as it is heritable (that is, the trait varies between individuals of the population), because it is possessing the trait that makes males attractive, and not the qualities of the trait in itself. Once a preference becomes established, females choosing males with elaborate secondary sexual traits will produce sons that carry alleles for the trait and daughters that carry alleles for the preference, generating genetic coupling that will drive self- reinforcing coevolution of both trait and preference, due to the mating advantage of males with the trait, creating a Fisherian runaway sexy sons process. Similar models have been proposed for postcopulatory female preferences, such as the time at which females removed the male's sperm ampulla after mating. Sexual selection by direct and/or indirect benefits as well as sexual conflict determine the evolution of animal mating systems. In its original context, the \\"narrow-sense sexy son hypothesis\\" of Weatherhead and Robertson refers to mating systems with care from both parents. In these mating systems, females that mate with a polygynous male normally receive less assistance than females mated with a monogamous male,Ligon JD. (1999). The evolution of avian breeding systems. New York: Oxford University Press. and thus suffer from direct fitness consequences that have to be (at least) compensated for by the breeding successes of their sexy sons. On the other hand, a \\"broad-sense sexy son hypothesis\\" encompasses both polygyny and promiscuous mating systems, with and without care from both parents. Alatalo (1998)Alatalo R.V., (1998). Mate choice for offspring performance: major benefits or minor costs? Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. vol 265, pp 2297-2297 argues that the costs of any additional choice may be so minor that female choice for honestly signaling males, that is good genes, may evolve even if the indirect benefits on offspring quality are small. A similar argument can be made for the sexy son hypothesis if mates of attractive males do not suffer any direct fitness consequences. Sexual conflict Guianan cock-of-the-rock Sexual conflict refers to the conflicting goals of breeding males and females. It describes the diverging interests of males and females in optimizing their fitness. From the viewpoint of any one partner, the best outcome would be for the partner's mate to care for the young, thus freeing up his or her own resources (e.g., time and energy) that s/he—but typically he—can invest in further sex that may create additional offspring. In polygynous mating systems, sexual conflict means the optimization of male reproductive success by having mated with multiple females, even though the reproductive success of a polygynously mated female is thereby reduced. Such can be the case for the Guianan cock-of-the-rocks, whose male members spend a majority of their time and energy maintaining their plumage and attempting to seek the most matings. Females, on the other hand, spend their time building and maintaining their nest where they will lay their eggs and raise the young. Good genes theory \\"Good genes\\" theory proposes that females select males seen to have genetic advantages that increase offspring quality. Increased viability of offspring provides compensation for any lower reproductive success that results from their being \\"picky\\". The good-gene hypothesis for polyandry proposes that when females encounter better males than their previous mates, they re-mate in order to fertilize their eggs with the better male's sperm. Dung beetles who have selected mates with better genetics tend to have offspring that survive longer and are more able to reproduce than those that do not pick mates with genetic quality. This suggests that carefully choosing a mate is beneficial. Another study notes that pronghorn females engage in an obvious and energetically expensive mate sampling process to identify vigorous males. Though each female selects independently, the outcome is that a small proportion of the herd's males sire most young. Offspring of attractive males were more likely to survive to weaning and to age classes as late as 5 years, apparently due to faster growth rates. Because pronghorn males do not have costly ornaments, the authors conclude that female choice for good genes can exist in the absence of obvious sexual selection cues such as elaborate antlers. The sexy son hypothesis is closely related to the good genes assumption and the Fisherian runaway selection process. Like good genes, the sexy son hypothesis assumes the existence of indirect genetic benefits that are able to compensate for any inferior direct reproductive success (i.e., fewer offspring). The main difference between good genes and the sexy son hypothesis is that the latter assumes an indirect effect due to the attractiveness of the sons, whereas good genes focus on the viability of both sons and daughters. However, \\"attractiveness\\" is not narrowly defined, and can refer to every trait that increases a male's probability to become polygynous. Sperm models The successful sperm is the one that fuses with the egg. Good-sperm models predict positive genetic associations between a male's sperm competitiveness and the general viability of his offspring, whereas sexy-sperm models predict that multiple-mating females produce more grandchildren. As with precopulatory processes, postcopulatory models predict that the trait in males that determines fertilization success will become genetically coupled with the mechanism by which females choose the sperm of preferred males.

For label updates, see FDA index page for BLA 761040 The medication consists of a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD22 (inotuzumab), linked to a cytotoxic agent from the class of calicheamicins called ozogamicin. This drug was discovered by scientists collaborating at Celltech and Wyeth, and it was developed by Pfizer which had acquired Wyeth. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. Medical use Inotuzumab ozogamicin is used to treat relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It is administered by intravenous infusion in a doctor's office or clinic. In studies in pregnant animals, the drug caused harm to the fetus at doses less than those used clinically, and so the drug has not been tested in pregnant women. Pregnant women should not take inotuzumab ozogamicin and must not become pregnant while taking it. It is unknown if the drug or its metabolites are secreted in breast milk, but women should not breastfeed while taking it, and should wait two months after the last dose to start breastfeeding. The drug prolongs the QT interval in some people, so it should be used with caution in people with heart arrhythmias. Adverse effects The US label for the use of inotuzumab ozagamicin carries an FDA black box warning concerning the risk of liver toxicity, in particular hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), which has been fatal in some people. The risk of this is higher in people who take the drug before having hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and more people die who have HSCT following treatment with this drug, than people who have HSCT taking other chemotherapies. The risk gets higher as more rounds of treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin are administered. The most common serious adverse reactions in people taking the drug in the clinical trial leading to approval were infections (23%), loss of neutrophils with fever (11%), hemorrhage (5%), stomach pain (3%), fever (3%), VOD (2%), and tiredness (2%). More than 20% of people had the following adverse reactions: loss of platelets (51%), loss of neutrophils (49%), infections (48%), anemia (36%), leukopenia (35%), tiredness (35%), hemorrhage (33%), fever (32%), nausea (31%), headache (28%), loss of neutrophils with fever (26%), elevated transaminases (26%), stomach pain (23%), and jaundice (21%). Between 10% and 20% of people also had loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores, constipation, chills, and injection site reactions. Pharmacology The antibody component of inotuzumab ozogamicin binds to CD22 receptors, which are expressed mostly on B cells. The whole conjugate is then drawn into the cell, where the ozogamicin is cleaved from the antibody by the acidic environment of the lysosome. The ozogamicin eventually travels to the nucleus where it breaks up DNA, causing the cell to die. Chemistry Inotuzumab ozogamicin consists of the humanized monoclonal antibody inotuzumab (against CD22), linked to a cytotoxic agent from the class of calicheamicins called ozogamicin. Ozogamicin is N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide. It includes the same linker, called \\"AcBut\\", and toxin, as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, which arose from the same collaboration. The linker is a carbonyl-containing carboxylic acid. The antibody, originally called G5/44, was created by grafting the complementarity-determining regions and some framework residues from the murine anti-CD22 mAb m5/44, onto human acceptor frameworks. History Celltech and Wyeth entered into a collaboration in 1991 to develop antibody- drug conjugates. The humanized antibody portion was generated at Celltech and the DNA encoding it was transfected into CHO cells, which were sent to Wyeth, where chemists expressed and purified the antibodies and conjugated them with the linker to the cytotoxin; the work was published in 2004. Celltech was acquired by UCB in 2004 and Wyeth was acquired by Pfizer in 2009. In May 2013 a phase III trial in patients with relapsed or refractory CD22+ aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who were not candidates for intensive high-dose chemotherapy was terminated for futility.Pfizer Discontinues Phase 3 Study of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Due to Futility.

The drug had been developed by Seattle Genetics as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a condition which results in the deaths of 9,000 people a year in the United States. Lintuzumab targets the CD33 protein, which is expressed in AML and other myeloproliferative diseases, but does not appear in abundance on normal cells. Trials for AML were abandoned in 2010 when a phase IIb trial failed to show increased survival. As of 2010, Seattle Genetics was conducting Phase II trials of lintuzumab in conjunction with bortezomib (marketed as Velcade) as a treatment for those with myelodysplastic syndromes. History of AML trials Lintuzumab had been in mid-stage clinical trial when Seattle Genetics pulled the drug in September 2010 after evidence showed that it did not lead to higher survival rates. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency had granted lintuzumab orphan drug status for treatment of AML and myelodysplastic syndromes.Lintuzumab (SGN-33), Seattle Genetics. Accessed September 13, 2010. Seattle Genetics had licensed lintuzumab from PDL BioPharma, which had been unsuccessful in treating AML in clinical trials of its own in which they used lower doses. The Phase IIb randomized, double-blind clinical trial studied 211 individuals ages 60 and over who had been enrolled by February 2009 and who were poor candidates for high-dose chemotherapy or had made the choice to reject the traditional chemotherapy treatment. The study participants typically had a projected four to five months to live, with half treated with lintuzumab and a low dose of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine, while the other half were given cytarabine in combination with a placebo. No patients were harmed in the trial and patients in both groups lived longer than expected, with those being given lintuzumab having a lower death rate. However, the study found that there was no benefit to patients on a statistical basis, and that it did not reduce the risk of infection or the need for blood transfusions. Competition Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (marketed as Mylotarg), a similar drug from Pfizer that also targets the CD33 protein on leukemic cells, was withdrawn from the market in June 2010 after trials showed little benefit to patients.

It binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with high affinity. The mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb425) from which matuzumab was developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Produced and developed by Merck Serono in cooperation with Takeda Pharmaceutical, it has undergone phase II clinical trials for the treatment of colorectal, lung, esophageal and stomach cancer early in the 2000s. In August 2007, Merck Serono announced that the preliminary results of the colorectal cancer study were less than promising, and that further trials for treating this type of cancer may be abandoned. In February 2008, the development was halted because of disappointing study results. Mechanism of action Matuzumab binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the outer membrane of normal and tumor cells. The matuzumab epitope has been mapped to domain III of the extracellular domain of the EGFR. The EGFR is receptor tyrosine kinase which binds multiple growth factors including EGF (epidermal growth factor) and other members of the EGF family of growth factors, resulting in activation of its tyrosine kinase activity. Activation of the EGFR has diverse effects on target cells depending on cell type and tissue context. It directs cell fate decision relating to cell growth, survival and, differentiation. Development of matuzumab and other antibodies to the EGFR (for example cetuximab) as cancer therapeutics was motivated by observations that EGFR expression and/or signaling is frequently upregulated in cancer cells. Preclinical and Clinical testing After determining the pharmacokinetic characteristics in a phase I study, several phase II studies investigating the treatment of advanced stomach carcinoma were conducted. At the conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in May 2005, the following results from clinical phase II studies with matuzumab were presented: =Advanced non-smallcellular lung carcinoma= Mutations in the kinase domain of the EGFR are observed with approximately 2 to 25% of non- small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients. Some studies have shown a negative correlation between the effectiveness of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and such mutations. The effect of matuzumab (in combination with paclitaxel) does not seem to be dependent on these mutations. =Advanced adenocarcinomas of stomach and esophagus= Results of two studies regarding adenocarcinomas have shown matuzumab to be well tolerated in combination with two standard chemotherapies – cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (PFL) as well as epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) – as a first line therapy. Rates of response were up to 53% with a combination of matuzumab and ECX. On August 27, 2007 Merck announced that matuzumab will not be used for intestinal cancer due to negative results in phase II studies. Discontinuation of development No further clinical trials have been conducted since the phase I trial in 2007. On February 18, 2008, Takeda and Merck announced that they would no longer pursue the development of the drug.

It housed the Louisiana State Legislature from the mid-19th century until the current capitol tower building was constructed in 1929-32. It was built to both look like and function like a castle and has led some locals to call it the Louisiana Castle, the Castle of Baton Rouge, the Castle on the River, or the Museum of Political History; although most people just call it the old capitol building. The term \\"Old State Capitol\\" in Louisiana is used to refer to the building and not to the two towns that were formerly the capital city: New Orleans and Donaldsonville. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 12, 1973, with six photos and two maps With . and was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 30, 1974. History In 1846, the state legislature in New Orleans decided to move the seat of government to Baton Rouge. As in many states, representatives from other parts of Louisiana feared a concentration of power in the state's largest city. In 1840, New Orleans' population was about 102,000, making it the fourth-largest city in the U.S. The 1840 population of Baton Rouge, on the other hand, was only 2,269. Louisiana's Old State Capitol. On September 21, 1847, the city of Baton Rouge donated to the state of Louisiana a $20,000 parcel of land for a state capitol building. The land donated by the city for the capitol stands high atop a bluff facing the Mississippi River, a site that some believe was once marked by the red pole, or baton rouge, which French explorers claimed designated a Native American council meeting site. New York architect James H. Dakin was hired to design the Baton Rouge capitol building, and rather than mimic the national Capitol Building in Washington, as so many other states had done, he conceived a Neo-Gothic medieval-style castle overlooking the Mississippi. In 1859, the statehouse was featured and favorably described in De Bow's Review, the most prestigious periodical in the antebellum South. Mark Twain, however, as a steamboat pilot in the 1850s, loathed the sight of it, \\"It is pathetic ... that a whitewashed castle, with turrets and things ... should ever have been built in this otherwise honorable place.\\"Life on the Mississippi, Chapter 40. The statehouse burns on 28 December 1862 In 1862, during the Civil War, Union Admiral David Farragut captured New Orleans, and the seat of government retreated from Baton Rouge. The Union's occupying troops first used the capitol building -- or \\"old gray castle,\\" as it was once described -- as a prison, and then to garrison African-American troops under General Culver Grover. While used as a garrison the building caught fire twice. This sequence of events transformed Louisiana's capitol into an empty, gutted shell abandoned by the Union Army. By 1882 the statehouse was totally rebuilt by architect and engineer William A. Freret, who is credited with the installation of the spiral staircase and the stained glass dome, which are the interior focal points. The refurbished statehouse remained in use until 1932, when it was abandoned for the new Louisiana State Capitol building. The Old State Capitol has since been used to house Federally-chartered veterans organizations, and as an office of the Works Progress Administration, among other things. Museum of Political History Stained glass window Stained glass dome Stained glass dome, as seen from the ground floor through the spiral staircase Restored in the 1990s, the Old State Capitol is now the Museum of Political History. Most recently, the exterior façade has been refurbished with shades of tan stucco, in noticeable contrast to its former gray stone coloring. Numerous events are held there including an annual ball wherein the participants re-enact dances and traditions of French culture while wearing 18th- and 19th-century dress. The museum's location downtown in Baton Rouge is within walking distance of the current capitol tower and of many culturally significant buildings. These include the Old Louisiana Governor's Mansion, the Louisiana Arts and Science Museum, St. Joseph Cathedral, and the widely acclaimed Shaw Center. In 2010, the Museum of Political History's visitor experience opened, designed by award-winning Bob Rogers and the design firm BRC Imagination Arts, with attractions and exhibits showcasing the building as an architectural treasure and highlighting historic artifacts.

Area of regulation \\"Food\\" within the context of FDA is a very broad term with some limitations. Products that contain meat are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, with the exception of seafood and some exotic meats. The regulation of eggs is similarly complicated by shared responsibilities between the two agencies. Many other federal and state agencies have some overlapping or conflicting requirements for regulation of food products. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates levels of allowable contaminants in public drinking water, where the FDA regulates bottled water. Regulation of food also includes food additives such as preservatives and artificial sweeteners. Controversies over preservatives were very important in the early days of the FDA, where volunteers participated in experimental meals with high doses of the chemicals to determine their toxicity. Levels of undesirable food additives, such as methyl mercury in canned tuna, are the responsibility of the FDA. FDA maintains a list of additives that are used in food in the United States as well as a list of additives Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS, pronounced grass). Products that contain ingredients that are not GRAS are usually dietary supplements (for example, many energy drinks contain stimulants which are not GRAS). Food products may make health claims, such as the \\"Heart Healthy\\" labels on foods high in fiber. Each specific claim must be submitted and is based on the content of the food, it is not an approval of a specific product. Dietary supplements may make \\"structure or function\\" claims but cannot legally claim to cure or prevent disease unless they meet an approved health claim as a food product. CFSAN is also responsible for food labeling, specifically the \\"Nutrition Facts\\" panel typically seen on packaged foods. Ingredient declarations are also required, and this is important for consumers with food allergies Regulation of food includes evaluations of products which are used in food handling and storage, referred to as \\"food contact surfaces.\\" Problems in this area include lead based glazes that are used to decorate ceramic dishes. =Areas of concern= * Biological Pathogens * Dietary Supplements * Toxic Metals * Food Allergens * Nutrient Concerns * Pesticide residue * Naturally occurring toxins * Decomposition and Filth * Dietary Components * Radionuclides * TSE-type diseases * Product tampering =Definitions= Before any product that classifies as a food/drug/cosmetic enters our markets, the FDA tests it to make sure it's not \\"harmful\\" to consumers.

The CFSAN contributes to a nationwide field force centered on the ideals and motives of the FDA, under delegated power from the FDA. The Center regulates approximately $240 billion worth of domestic food while simultaneously regulating $15 billion worth of imported foods and $15 billion worth of cosmetics sold domestically. The center controls domestically with approximately 50,000 food establishments and 3,500 cosmetic firms. The services of the center are trained and enhanced by the FDA. Most of the power for the CFSAN stems from congressional power given to the FDA through Acts and Regulations. The power to enforce the Acts and Regulations is then delegated from the FDA to the CFSAN as well as the other 5 product oriented centers. The congressional power can be traced to various acts and regulations such as:CFSAN Overview * Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 * The Federal Import Milk Act (1927) * The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 * The Public Health Service Act (1944) * The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (1966) * The Infant Formula Act of 1980 * The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 * The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 Structure and personnel =Structure= In 1992 the organization evaluated its structure and concluded that its 20-year-old configuration was insufficient to provide proper service in current times. New legislative and budgetary obstacles also fueled the need for change. In response to all of this, the food program joined together its once disconnected scientific and regulatory policies. Rather than being a rigidly centralized organization they separated their various tasks and assigned each to a designated office. Strategic managers assigned issues facing multiple offices at once, while each office is headed by an Office Manager. This allows adequate management on both macro and micro scales. =Organization= *Office of Analytics and Outreach *Office of Food Safety *Office of Cosmetics and Colors *Office of Dietary Supplement Programs *Office of Regulatory Science *Office of Food Additive Safety *Office of Compliance *Office of Applied Research & Safety Assessment *Office of Regulations & Policy *Office of Nutrition and Food Labelling *Office of Executive Programs *Office of Coordinated Outbreak Response & Evaluation Network =Personnel= * Executive Officer: Thomas D.

Brackett, Ph.D. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has over 800 employees with a wide range of job titles. From secretary to molecular chemist, the Center has an extensive staff that covers every possible aspect of food and nutrition science. In the past, most of the Center's work force was stationed at their headquarters in Washington, D.C., but in 2001 most of the headquarters staff was moved to its new location in College Park, Maryland. Mission statement CFSAN's mission statement reads \\"CFSAN, in conjunction with the Agency's field staff, is responsible for promoting and protecting the public's health by ensuring that the nation's food supply is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and honestly labeled, and that cosmetic products are safe and properly labeled.\\"CFSAN mission statement Important regulations established The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition or CFSAN imposes regulations mainly on corporate entities that create and market foods and drugs. These regulations usually have to deal with products in the pipeline for introduction into the American market. Here is an abbreviated list from the linked page that highlights the most important and influential actions regulation created by the FDA. It also deals with the expansion of the FDA's powers and the creation of the agency itself. *1906- The original Food and Drug act is passed that mandates strict health safety and testing policies be established mostly in response to the recently publicized meat packing plant scandals, as well as poisonous ingredients that were being added to other products for preservation and \\"health benefits\\". The act was a huge step forward in the overall health and safety of the consumer, and laid the groundwork for future consumer advocate success. *1912- The Shirley Amendment is passes that effectively prohibits false advertising of therapeutic benefits from the use of food/dietary supplement products *1958- Food additives Act passed that required companies to predetermine safety of additives and submit them to the FDA for testing *1990- Nutrition Labeling and Education Act- establishes the modern guidelines for nutritional labeling and inspection *2004- Food allergy Labeling act requires companies to label foods with peanuts, soybeans, cows milk, eggs, fish, tree nuts, wheat, and shellfish CFSAN publishes the \\"Bad Bug Book\\", which provides information about the microorganisms that cause foodborne illness. Organizations that influence CFSAN There are two main research groups outside the FDA that have a direct impact on the CFSAN, the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, and the National Center for Food Safety and Technology. In addition, there are many interest groups who have a stake in CFSAN's policies. The Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN) is a partnership between the FDA (specifically, the CFSAN and Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)) and the University of Maryland. JIFSAN was created in 1996 to \\"provide the scientific basis for ensuring a safe, wholesome food supply as well as provide the infrastructure for contributions to national food safety programs and international food standards.\\" Currently JIFSAN is working on such research as Risk Analysis, Microbial Pathogens and Toxins, Food Composition and Applied Nutrition, and Animal Health Sciences and Food Safety.JIFSAN Research The Institute for Food Safety and Health, or IFSH (formerly National Center for Food Safety and Technology) is a research group between CFSAN, the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and members of the food industry. IFSH is \\"a world-class food science research institute that produces knowledge-based outcomes in the areas of food safety, food defense, and nutrition for stakeholders in government, industry, and academia.\\" Because CFSAN regulates food safety and labeling, many food industry groups have an interest in their policies. Some of these groups include: * American Feed Industry Association * The Association of Food & Drug Officials * Food Marketing Institute * Institute of Food Technologists * National Chicken Council * National Pork Board * National Turkey Federation * United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association CFSAN is also a partner in the Partnership for Food Safety Education (PFSE), an organization dedicated to educating the public about food safety. The PFSE comprises some federal agencies, such as the CDC and the EPA, with many members from the food industry.Partnership for Food Safety Education See also * Food and Drug Administration * Food Safety and Inspection Service  References  Food and Drug Administration Food safety in the United States ","title":"Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition"},{"id":"9686228","title":"Luís Jesus"},{"id":"9686234","text":"is a Japanese voice actress primarily for visual novels.

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is the branch of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices. The CDRH also oversees the radiation safety performance of non-medical devices which emit certain types of electromagnetic radiation, such as cellular phones and microwave ovens. The current head of the CDRH is Jeffrey Shuren, who took over in January 2010. Regulatory classes CDRH splits medical devices into three classes with different regulatory requirements: Class 1 devices include everyday items such as toothbrushes which are unlikely to cause serious consequences if they fail. Manufacturers are required to follow what are called \\"general controls\\" which closely match ISO 9000 requirements.International Organization for Standardization In addition to the general controls, Class 2 devices require a premarket notification. This process, commonly known as the \\"510(k)\\" process after the relevant section of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, results in FDA clearance of a product. The intent of this class was for new manufacturers of devices that already existed when the rules were established. A Class 2 device is required to be \\"substantially equivalent\\" to existing devices. The class is now used for \\"medium risk\\" devices such as demineralized bone powder used for reconstructive surgery, which is officially substantially equivalent to Plaster of Paris, a much older product that was used for the same purpose. This equivalence is used when the FDA does not think a full approval process with extensive clinical trials is necessary. The premarket notification process came under fire in February 2011 after the release of a study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Center for Health Research, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \\"serious health problems or death\\" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, cheaper 510(k) process. In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not undergo any FDA regulatory review. Of the 113 devices recalled during the 5 year period, 35 were for cardiovascular issues.Zuckerman et al. \\"Medical Device Recalls and the FDA Approval Process.\\" Arch Intern Med. 2011; 0: 2011301-6. This study was the topic of Congressional hearings re-evaluating FDA procedures and oversight.Redberg and Dhruva. \\"Medical Device Recalls: Comment on 'Medical Device Recalls and the FDA Approval Process.'\\" Arch Intern Med. 2011; 0: 2011271-2. A study by Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings and colleagues at the National Center for Health Research, published in 2018 in the policy journal Milbank Quarterly, investigated whether studies reviewed by the FDA for high- risk medical devices are proven safe and effective for women, racial or ethnic minorities, or patients over 65 years of age. The law encourages patient diversity in clinical trials submitted to the FDA for review, but does not require it. The study determined that most high-risk medical devices are not tested and analyzed to ensure that they are safe and effective for all major demographic groups, particularly racial and ethnic minorities and people over 65. Therefore, they do not provide information about safety or effectiveness that would help patients and physicians make well informed decisions. Class 3 devices require a \\"Pre-market Approval\\" (PMA), which is analogous to the drug approval process with clinical trials and extensive review of the design. Class 3 devices tend to be products such as pacemakers which would cause obvious risk of injury or death if they did not function properly. As with all devices, the manufacturers must follow the general controls. History CDRH's earliest predecessor was the Radiological Health Unit within the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Bureau of State Services, which was established in 1948. As part of the PHS reorganizations of 1966–1973, it became the Bureau of Radiological Health within the Environmental Control Administration in 1968. When the Environmental Control Administration was transformed into the Environmental Protection Agency in 1971, the Bureau of Radiological Health's personnel and facilities were split, with portions of it transferred to EPA, while the remainder became part of the FDA. The Bureau of Medical Devices was established within FDA in 1973, and merged with the Bureau of Radiological Health in 1982 to form the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The merge was the result of the beginning of the biotechnology revolution blurring the lines between drugs, biologics, and medical devices, leading to Commissioner Arthur Hayes reorganizing the FDA to merge the bureaus responsible for medical devices and radiation control into their present form.Reid, Ken. \\"CBER and CDER have long history of being lumped together and split up.\\" Bioresearch Monitoring Alert Sept. 2002. page 4.

While the series often follows the investigations to their end, it usually focuses on their first 48 hours, hence the title. Each episode picks one or more homicides in different cities, covering each alternately, showing how detectives use forensic evidence, witness interviews, and other advanced investigative techniques to identify suspects. While most cases are solved within the first 48 hours, some go on days, weeks, months or even years after the first 48. The series was nominated for a Distinguished Documentary Achievement Award in the Continuing Series category by the International Documentary Association, eventually losing to PBS' American Experience. By season 6, The First 48 had become the highest- rated non-fiction justice series on television and had gained critical acclaim along with controversy. The season 8 episode, \\"Gone,\\" which aired on January 1, 2009, garnered a domestic audience of 2.3 million viewers, becoming the series' most-watched episode at the time. Title sequence Until the 28th episode of the 12th season, the opening title sequence featured the conceptual statement \\"For homicide detectives, the clock starts ticking the moment they are called. Their chance of solving a murder is cut in half if they don't get a lead within the first 48 hours.\\" The original soundtrack, opening title theme and dark ambient sound design for the overall program was composed by Chuck Hammer (2004-2006). Later composers included Brian and Justin Deming (2006-2008) and Paul Brill (2008-2018), who continued with a combination of dark ambient music integrated with sound design. Episodes =Spin-offs= After the First 48 title card The series has several follow-up episodes entitled After the First 48-- detailing the trials of those accused in previous episodes-- and the aftermath of victims' survivors. The First 48: Missing Persons follows the same story format as the original series. The Killer Speaks depicts convicted felons as they describe their crimes through their first-hand accounts. The latest spin-off, Marcia Clark Investigates: The First 48, follows a similar story format but focuses on highly publicized cases such as those of Casey Anthony, Drew Peterson and Robert Blake, presented by O. J. Simpson trial prosecutor Marcia Clark. Reception A 2016 study by The New York Times of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook likes found that The First 48 \\"has a classic Black Belt audience pattern.\\" Controversy On November 18, 2009, 21-year-old Taiwan Smart of Miami was charged with two counts of second-degree murder of his two roommates in Little Haiti. His story aired later as an episode titled \\"Inside Job.\\" Evidence later established that police made important mistakes in their investigation. Additionally, The First 48 misrepresented a key witness' statement on the program. Smart was released in June 2011 and has since sued the city of Miami for false imprisonment. The episode, which originally aired on July 15, 2010, continues to air without correction. In 2014, the city of Miami announced that it would be ending its contract with A&E;, ending any future productions of The First 48. On May 16, 2010, 7-year-old Aiyana Jones of Detroit was shot and killed during a \\"special weapons and tactics\\" (SWAT) raid that was recorded by The First 48 cameras. Detroit SWAT unit raided the duplex while searching for a homicide suspect. On October 5, 2011, prosecutors charged the Detroit police officer with the involuntary manslaughter of Jones. Allison Howard, an A&E; Television Network camera operator filming that night, was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice after lying under oath. She pleaded no contest to obstruction of justice and was sentenced to two years of probation. On December 16, 2015, Shawn Peterson pled guilty to manslaughter for the triple murder of his ex-girlfriend, Christine George, her son, Leonard and her daughter, Trisa in the Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans. Peterson's defense attorneys argued that producers from The First 48 withheld video evidence that could have exonerated their client. A judge rejected the motion but conceded that the show did complicate the case. In 2016, the city of New Orleans announced that it would be ending its contract with A&E;, ending any future productions of The First 48 or Nightwatch, another A&E; show set in New Orleans. The show's unprecedented access to police departments has generated some controversy because such access is not typically given to traditional local news media. Moreover, the show has been criticized for putting witnesses in danger by revealing their faces and their voices on a nationally televised program and for not being sensitive to what might happen to them in the form of retaliation. In response to such criticism, witnesses often ask producers to have their faces blurred out and voices changed or to speak off camera.

Biography  Born in Málaga, Spain, Kent was affiliated to the Radical Socialist Republican Party and came to fame in 1930 for defending – at a court martial – Álvaro de Albornoz, who would shortly afterwards go on to become minister of justice and later the future president of the Republican government in exile (1947 to 1949 and 1949 to 1951). She became a member of the first Parliament of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. That same year, the President of the Republic, Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, appointed her Director General of Prisons, a post she held until 1934, and she actively continued the reforms in the prison service that had been started by Concepción Arenal. Kent was against giving women the right to vote immediately, arguing that, as Spanish women lacked at that moment social and political education enough to vote responsibly, they would be very much influenced by the Catholic priests, damaging left wing parties. She had a controversy about this subject with another feminist in the parliament, Clara Campoamor. This caused her certain unpopularity and, when women were given right to vote, she lost her seat – as she had predicted – to the conservative majority in 1933. After the Spanish Civil War, Kent went into exile in Mexico, but soon moved on to the United States. In New York City she published the Ibérica review from 1954 to 1974, Catálogo biblioteca del Instituto Cervantes de Nueva York, Ibérica : por la libertad , Victoria Kent editor. which featured news for Spaniards exiled in the United States. She died in New York in 1987, and is buried alongside her partner Louise Crane at Umpawaug Cemetery, Redding, Connecticut. Colleges in Málaga, Fuenlabrada, Marbella, Torrejón de Ardoz (Instituto de Educación Secundaria Victoria Kent), and a railway station in her home town of Málaga, have been named after her. Historians have not adequately discussed her lesbianism.  Political life  Shortly after her arrival in Madrid, she joined the Asociación Nacional de Mujeres Españolas y la Juventud Universitaria Femenina (a women's rights organization), directed by Maria Espinosa de los Monteros. She represented this entity at a conference in Prague in 1921. After affiliating the Radical Socialist Republican Party, she was elected as a member of the Parliament of the Republican-Socialist Conjunction of the Republican Court in 1931. In the election on February 16, 1936, Victoria Kent was elected member of the Parliament in Jaen, for the Republican Left, which was a part of the Popular Front. She was also Vice President of the Lyceum Club, since 1926.  Opposition to women's suffrage  One of the most outstanding and controversial moments in Kent's personal and political life would be her opposition to women's suffrage before the Spanish Parliament in 1931, when she faced another feminist, Clara Campoamor, in a dialectical and significant battle on an issue that would have a great effect on the rights of women. She declared that Spanish women were not socially and politically prepared to vote. According to her, Spanish women were also influenced by the Church and their vote would be conservative and harmful for the Republic. On the contrary, Clara Campoamor defended that women had the right to vote as she defended the equality of all human beings. After her intervention, Victoria lost her popularity and therefore she did not take part in the Parliament in the 1933 elections. Campoamor finally won the debate against Victoria Kent in 1933 and this made women able to vote by universal suffrage. The 1933 elections were won by the right wing as it was united.  Spanish Civil War  Due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War , Victoria Kent was forced to go into exile like many other Republicans. As she was going into exile, she helped children whose fathers were soldiers to be evacuated. She took refuge in Paris, and was named First Secretary of the Spanish Embassy in the capital so that she could continue taking care of refugee children. She was also responsible for the creation of shelters and nurseries for the same purpose.  Second World War  She remained in Paris until the end of the Civil War, helping Spanish exiles in the capital and their departure to America. However, at the beginning of Second World War as Paris was being occupied on June 14, 1940 by the Nazi invasion (Wehrmacht), Victoria was forced to take refuge in the Mexican Embassy for a year. She was judged by Franco's courts and in October 1943, when she was still in Paris, she was sentenced to prison for 30 years, expelling her from national territory. Fortunately, the Red Cross gave her an apartment in Boulogne (north of France), where she lived until 1944 protected by a fake identity. During that time, \\"Madame Duval\\" being her false identity, she wrote Cuatro Años en París, a novel with autobiographical aspects reflected in the main character, Placido.  Exile  She went into exile in Mexico in 1948. She worked there for two years teaching criminal law at the University. In 1950, she was hired by the UN, and left Mexico for New York, where she worked for the social defense and led a study based on the poor conditions of prisons in Latin America. Between 1951 and 1957, she left her previous job and became minister, without portfolio, of the Second Spanish Republic's Government from the exile. This made her the second female minister since Federica Montseny. She also founded the magazine \\"Iberica,\\" which appealed to all the exiles that lived far from their homeland, like her. This magazine was financed by her partner, Louise Crane for twenty years (1954–1974). In 1977, forty years after her exile in France, Victoria returned to Spain and was welcomed with affection and admiration. However, she came back to New York where she spent her last days and died on September 26, 1987. In 1986 she was awarded the medal of San Raimundo de Peñafor, but because of her old age she was not able to receive it in person.

Initial reports erroneously linked the virus to prostate cancer and later to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), leading to considerable interest in the scientific and patient communities, investigation of XMRV as a potential cause of multiple medical conditions, and public-health concerns about the safety of the donated blood supply. Xenotropic viruses replicate or reproduce in cells other than those of the host species. Murine refers to the rodent family Muridae, which includes common household rats and mice. Subsequent research established that XMRV was in fact a laboratory contaminant, rather than a novel pathogen. XMRV was generated unintentionally in the laboratory, through genetic recombination between two mouse retroviruses during propagation of a prostate-cancer cell line in the mid-1990s. via EBSCO login False-positive detection of XMRV may also occur because of contamination of clinical specimens and laboratory reagents with other mouse retroviruses or related nucleic acids. Most scientific publications claiming an association of XMRV with CFS or prostate cancer have been retracted, and allegations of research misconduct were leveled against at least one CFS investigator. There is no evidence that XMRV can infect humans, nor that XMRV is associated with or causes any human disease. Classification and genome XMRV is a murine leukemia virus (MLV) that formed through the recombination of the genomes of two parent MLVs known as preXMRV-1 and preXMRV-2. MLVs belong to the virus family Retroviridae and the genus gammaretrovirus and have a single-stranded RNA genome that replicates through a DNA intermediate. The name XMRV was given because the discoverers of the virus initially thought that it was a novel potential human pathogen that was related to but distinct from MLVs. The XMRV particle is approximately spherical and 80 to 100 nm in diameter.Several XMRV genomic sequences have been published to date. These sequences are almost identical, an unusual finding as retroviruses replicate their genomes with relatively low fidelity, leading to divergent viral sequences in a single host organism. In 2010 the results of phylogenetic analyses of XMRV and related murine retroviruses led a group of researchers to conclude that XMRV \\"might not be a genuine human pathogen\\". Xenotropic viruses (xenos Gr. foreign; tropos Gr. turning) were initially discovered in the New Zealand Black (NZB) mouse and later found to be present in many other mouse strains including wild mice.Levy, J.A., Xenotropic viruses: murine leukemia viruses associated with NIH Swiss, NZB, and other mouse strains. Science, 1973. 182: p. 1151-1153.Levy, J.A., Xenotropic type C viruses. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, 1978. 79: p. 111-213. Discovery XMRV was discovered in the laboratories of Joseph DeRisi at the University of California, San Francisco, and Robert Silverman and Eric Klein of the Cleveland Clinic. Silverman had previously cloned and investigated the enzyme ribonuclease L (RNase L), part of the cell’s natural defense against viruses. When activated, RNase L degrades cellular and viral RNA to halt viral replication. In 2002, the \\"hereditary prostate cancer 1\\" locus (HPC1) was mapped to the RNase L gene, implicating it in the development of prostate cancer. The cancer-associated \\"R462Q\\" mutation results in a glutamine instead of an arginine at position 462 of the RNase L enzyme, reducing its catalytic activity. A man with two copies of this mutation has twice the risk of prostate cancer; one copy raises the risk by 50%. Klein and Silverman hypothesized that \\"the putative linkage of RNase L alterations to HPC might reflect enhanced susceptibility to a viral agent\\" and conducted a viral screen of prostate cancer samples, leading to the discovery of XMRV. Disease association studies =Prostate cancer= Detection of XMRV was reported in a 2010 article. =Other conditions= In one study, XMRV was detected in a small percentage of patients with weakened immune systems, PDF: https://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/6/pdfs/1000.pdf but other studies found no evidence of XMRV in immunosuppression. =Contamination and artifact= Initially promising results were later disproven or failed replication. Blood supply controversy XMRV is closely related to several known xenotropic mouse viruses. These viruses recognize and enter cells of non- rodent species by means of the cell-surface xenotropic and polytropic murine leukemia virus receptor (XPR1). Only fractionated plasma is heat treated, blood for transfusion is not. A United States federal consortium is now working to determine the prevalence of XMRV in the blood supply and the suitability of different detection methods.

Biography Dalgard was born Olaf Hanssen in Folldal, in Hedmark, Norway. From the age of three, he raised at Oppdal in Trøndelag. He earned an M.A. degree in literature and art history at the University of Oslo in 1929. He was an advocate of the use of Nynorsk and served as the chairman of the student Nynorsk association. He was also in the Mot Dag movement. Dalgard worked as a literary critic for the newspapers Dagbladet and Arbeiderbladet. Dalgard took over as dramatic advisor and instructor for Det Norske Teateret in 1931 and was attached to the theater for 48 years. He studied film in the Soviet Union and in the 1930s produced several films with a socialist message. Dalgard was also active in the Norwegian Labour Party's cultural operations. During the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Dalgard was arrested in 1942, held as a political prisoner by German authorities and sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Dalgard was involved in the establishment of the Norwegian Film Institute and was a member of the state film board. Among his most famous works was Gryr i Norden (1939). Dalgard both wrote the script and directed the film which was a dramatization of the Kristiania Match Workers Strike of 1889 (fyrstikkarbeiderstreiken). He also wrote a number of books about theater and film as well as biographies including Teateret frå Aiskylos til Ibsen (1948), Filmskuespillet – sakprosa (1951), Teateret i det 20. hundreåret – sakprosa (1955), Lars Tvinde – biografi over Lars Tvinde (1966) and Inge Krokann – biografi over Inge Krokann (1970). Dalgard was chairman of the Norwegian Literature Critics' Association from 1953–55, and president of the Norwegian Humanist Association from 1965-77. From 1961, Dalgard received a government grant.

Its studios and offices are located in the Communication Arts and Sciences Building, at the southeast corner of Wilson and Red Cedar Roads on the MSU campus. The station dates to experimental broadcasts at Michigan State, then known as Michigan Agricultural College, beginning in 1917. WKAR's first official broadcast was a \\"Founder's Day\\" speech on May 13, 1922. MAC was granted a full license on August 18, 1922. Although the call letters appear to stand for K(C)ollege of AgricultuRe, they were actually randomly assigned by Herbert Hoover, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce (which was the sole radio licensing authority). It is the oldest surviving radio station in the Lansing area. The first station was WREO which went on the air in 1921 and shut down in 1927.http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=S0652.htmhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/lugnut215/26089732252/ It was one of a number of AM stations signed on by universities (mostly land- grant institutions like MAC) in the early days of radio. Originally broadcasting at AM 1050, it moved to 1080 in 1928. It moved to 1040 in 1930 to alleviate interference with KRLD in Dallas, but had to move to 850 in 1936. It moved to its current home on 870 in 1941 as part of the massive frequency shift enacted by the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement.1938 Broadcasting Yearbook lists WKAR as operating on 1040. However Radio Annual for 1936-1941 says 850 moving to 870 in the 1941 frequency shift Between 1939-1941 WKAR boosted power from 1,000 to 5,000 watts. The station expanded to its current 10,000 watts in the late 1960s. The WKAR stations were charter members of NPR, and were among the 90 stations that carried the initial broadcast of All Things Considered. The station is one of the few NPR stations that does not operate 24 hours a day. It must sign off at sundown to protect WWL in New Orleans, though W286DC is allowed to operate 24/7 as an FM translator. During the winter months, the AM signal generally signs off between 5 pm and 6 pm, returning to the air at 8 am. During the summer months, it generally signs off at 8 pm and returns to the air at 6 am. The majority of its schedule consists of NPR national programming, and the BBC World Service. Local programs include the daily news/arts magazine Current State, the daily sports talk/call-in Current Sports and the long-running Spanish-language Ondas en Español hosted by Tony \\"El Chayo\\" Cervantes on weekends.

Skinner was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing North Shore for the Liberal Party from 1994 to 2017 and was the Deputy Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party from 2007 to 2014. Between 2011 and 2015 Skinner also served as the Minister for Medical Research. On 27 January 2017, Skinner announced her intention to resign from the ministry and from Parliament. Early life and career Skinner was educated at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne. She began as a journalist working for the Melbourne Herald and later continued her career in Hong Kong, working for Radio Hong Kong and The Associated Press, Hong Kong from 1962 to 1973. Upon returning to Australia, Skinner continued working as a journalist in Melbourne, including a period on the Parliamentary Press Gallery during the Premiership of Sir Henry Bolte, Sydney and Adelaide. She has lived in Sydney since 1979. From 1984 to 1988 she was involved in editorial writing, research, policy development and strategic planning. From 1988 to 1994 she was Director of the New South Wales Office of Youth Affairs. She is married with three children, of whom at least one was living with her husband in Melbourne in 1987. Political career Skinner joined the Liberal Party and became vice- president of the Cremorne Branch and gained preselection for the seat of North Shore at the 1984 election, and the 1988 election. However, she was defeated by the sitting independent member, Ted Mack. When Mack resigned, Skinner again contested North Shore at the ensuing by-election but lost to Robyn Read, an independent candidate; Skinner gained 35 per cent of the primary vote. At the 1991 state election Skinner did not contest for the seat of North Shore. Instead, sitting Liberal MP Phillip Smiles ran for the seat, after his own seat of Mosman was abolished in a redistribution. Although North Shore's demographics suggested it should have been a comfortably safe Liberal seat, Smiles was the first Liberal to win it, ending a decade of representation by independent MPs. However, by late December 1993, Smiles was forced to resign from Parliament after being convicted of tax evasion. Skinner subsequently gained Liberal Party preselection for the ensuing by-election. Skinner with Barry O'Farrell celebrates the 2008 Ryde By-election win, 18 October 2008. On 5 February 1994, Skinner was elected as Member for North Shore with 54 percent of the primary vote and 58 percent of the two-party vote, defeating former independent member Read in a rematch. She was duly sworn in as a member of the NSW Legislative Assembly. Skinner has never faced another contest nearly that close in this comfortably safe Liberal seat. For example, she secured a swing of 13.9 points at the 2011 state election and won 80.3 per cent of the two- party vote. After the Labor party won the 1995 election, Skinner was appointed to the opposition frontbench and held various shadow portfolios over the next decade. Under opposition leaders Peter Collins, John Brogden and Peter Debnam, Skinner was Shadow Minister for Health (1995–2003, 2005-2011), Youth Affairs (1995–99, 2002–03), Arts (2003–08), Education and Training (2003–05), School Education (2005), Cancer and Medical Research (2006–07) and Science and Medical Research (2007–08). Following the 2007 election, Debnam's deputy, Barry O'Farrell, announced he would challenge Debnam's leadership. When it became apparent that Debnam did not have enough support to fend off O'Farrell's challenge, he resigned, leaving O'Farrell to take the leadership unopposed. Skinner was elected Deputy Leader, and hence Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She retained the position of Shadow Minister for Health, which she has held from 7 September 2005 until the 2011 state election when the Coalition gained government. Following the Coalition's landslide victory in 2011, O'Farrell announced that Skinner would be appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Health and Minister for Medical Research. When O'Farrell resigned as Premier in April 2014, Skinner opted not to continue as deputy leader under his successor, Mike Baird. She was succeeded by Gladys Berejiklian. On 27 January 2017, shortly after Baird resigned and was succeeded by Berejiklian, Skinner announced her intention to resign from politics. She formally resigned on 20 February 2017.

Skeppar Olofs Gränd (Swedish: \\"Alley of Skipper Olof\\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching from Köpmangatan to Trädgårdsgatan, it forms a parallel street to Peder Fredags Gränd and Trädgårdstvärgränd. History Appearing in historical records as skepper Olaffz grändh in 1587, the alley is named after the skipper Olof Eriksson. Commonly known as Skeppar Olof, he served under King Gustav Vasa from 1525 and was skipper on board the ship Ugglan (\\"The Owl\\") in 1526. He was one of the leading figures in the organisation of the first fleet of the Swedish Navy, both as a master shipbuilder and as a naval commander. As one of the most trusted merchants of the king, Olof made a fortune, and as one of the most prominent burghers in the city, he was appointed magistrate, member of a court of first instance, head of the goldsmith guild, and churchwarden at the Cathedral. Skeppar Olof died in 1555 and is buried in the cathedral (which he saved from the king's plans to demolish it). One of the many buildings he owned was located between the alley and Österlånggatan, in 1528 it was referred to as Schepar Olofz huus i Olof Grelsons g[ränd] (\\"House of Skipper Olof in the alley of Olof Grelson\\"), and in 1597 it was subject to his widow's distribution of the estate. The skipper in question might have lived in the medieval building on the right side directly after the vault. In the alley is a memorial tile dedicated to Sara Wacklin (1790–1846), a teacher and writer who was born in Uleåborg, moved to Stockholm in 1843, and lived and eventually died in the alley. She is mostly remembered for her book Hundrade minnen från Österbotten (\\"A Hundred memories from Ostrobothnia\\", 1844–45) which deals with the fate of Finland following the Swedish defeat in the Finnish War of 1807–1809, and condemns those who \\"longed for war without having seen its atrocities\\".

Where a national or prefectural road runs through the territory of a designated major city, the city government assumes part of the responsibility for these roads. By length, 10.7 % of public roads in Japan were prefectural roads as of 2011; by usage, they carried more than 30% of all traffic volume on public roads as of 2007.MLIT (Kokudo-kōtsū-shō), Road bureau (dōro-kyoku): Road definition & classification Prefectural roads are marked with a blue hexagon, with the number centered. Most usually end at another prefectural road, or national route, or occasionally at or very close to a Japan Railway station. If a prefectural road does cross into another prefecture, even if for a few hundred feet, its number is not reused by the prefecture it crosses into. Numbers are used only once in each prefecture, regardless of where the road begins or ends. However, there are some major roads running through several prefectures which have the same number in all prefectures involved. For example, the \\"Sano-Koga line\\" (Sano-Koga-sen, 佐野古河線) that connects Sano city in Tochigi prefecture and Koga city in Ibaraki prefecture is continually designated as prefectural road 9 in all four prefectures it runs through, namely Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama and Ibaraki. Some prefectural roads will also at times run for a short distance concurrent with a national route, but it is more common to see this with other prefectural roads. Numbers used for national routes that run through a prefecture are often duplicated by prefectural routes but a national route and a prefectural route bearing the same number rarely if ever meet or cross each other.

The park occupies an area of about and contains four pools, the largest of which covers approximately . Professional park rangers are employed to look after the varied flora and fauna of the park as well as the general maintenance of pathways and buildings. The park is run by Warwickshire County Council with half in Rugby Borough and half in Warwick District boundary. The area of the park containing the pools is reasonably flat and suitable for wheelchair access. History The park was a set of fields until 1965 when the land was purchased and used as a landfill site for the nearby towns of Leamington Spa, Rugby and Coventry. Waste was dumped there for 27 years until 1992 when work started on developing part of the site into a country park, which included the flooding of the pits. The park officially opened in 1996 with over 2,500 trees and shrubs being planted. In the late 1990s the remainder of the landfill site was filled in and new pools were created, as well as the provision of several portable metal cabins to act as information centres. These were superseded by better and more permanent wooden ones in 2002, although the metal ones are still in use. Facilities The grounds have official opening times which vary according to the seasons; however, visitors can enter the park on-foot outside these hours if they wish. There are two car parks in the park, and there is currently a flat rate charge of £3.50 for any vehicle to enter the park. Public transport to the park is extremely limited. Facilities at the park include a visitor centre/cafe and gift shop, two children's play areas for different ages of children, a bird hide,miles of pathed and unpathed walks, and fishing facilities and a miniature railway run by the Coventry Model Engineering Society. The railway is around 610 metres (2000ft or so) long and operates for the public every Sunday afternoon (1pm-4pm) from Easter until the end of September. Train rides are £1 per person per ride with the journey lasting around 6 minutes or so. Trains are hauled by either a steam or diesel locomotive. (All trains run weather permitting). The park also organises events for children such as parties, birds of prey spotting, \\"creepy crawly club\\", nest box building, and \\"prams in the park\\" (walking for parents with babies). There is a bird hide located by one of the pools where visitors can observe the wildlife in relative quiet. Energy from methane A methane- powered electricity generator is situated in the park. It uses the methane which results from the decomposition of the organic rubbish that was dumped nearby when the area was used as a landfill site. In one year it provides the National Grid with enough electricity to run the equivalent of 18 secondary schools or roughly 2,000 houses. Information about the project, which is intended primarily for school children, is available within the generator building where there is also an opportunity to see the generators themselves. Ryton Wood Ryton Wood, situated next to the country park, is of oak woodland which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and owned by Warwickshire Wildlife Trust. It is also open to the public.

The conference is one of two annual events hosted by the Free State Project in an effort to recruit 20,000 individuals with libertarian ideals to move to New Hampshire, the other being the Porcupine Freedom Festival. As of February 3, 2016, the group has 20,000 participants signed on, hence completing the original goal. The signatories are now expected to move to New Hampshire by 2022, 5 years after the end of the drive. 2016 conference The 2016 New Hampshire Liberty Forum was held from February 18 through February 21, 2016 at the Radisson Hotel in Manchester, New Hampshire. The theme of the 2016 conference was \\"Living Liberty,\\" which focused on participants who had already moved to New Hampshire and how they are exploring and expanding their personal liberties there. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden gave the keynote speech, via live video stream from his exile in Russia. Lyn Ulbricht spoke and shared an update on the appeal trial of her son, Ross Ulbricht, sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for allegedly creating a darknet market named Silk Road under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts. 2015 conference The 2015 conference was held on March 5 through March 8, 2015 at the Radisson Hotel in Manchester, New Hampshire. The event was branded using dark blue, light blue, white, and gold theming. The logo featured a stylized map of New Hampshire, divided into polygonal shapes using the branding colors of the event, but introducing different green and blue shades which were only present in the logo. The slogan of the event was \\"Moved By Liberty\\". The event featured a media room, various speakers organized into interest-based tracks, a vendor showcase, children's activities, and art workshops. Event tickets were sold in tiers, and many attendees of the event were also entitled to catered meals for lunch and dinner, a brunch, access to snacks, and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages with purchase of the VIP-tier ticket, which permitted access to the hospitality suite. In contrast with previous events and aligning with the creation of interest-specific tracks, speakers for the 2015 event were not designated 'keynote' speakers.

Abhiṣeka is common to Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Hinduism An abhiṣeka is conducted by priests by bathing the image of the deity being worshipped, amidst the chanting of mantras. Usually, offerings such as milk, yogurt, ghee, honey, panchamrita, sesame oil, rose water, sandalwood paste may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being performed. This rite is routinely performed in Hindu temples. A Rudrābhiṣeka or abhiṣeka of Rudra is performed on lingams. A Kumbhabhishekam is a consecration ritual for a Hindu temple. Buddhism =Vajrayana Buddhism= List of Abhiseka initiates in 812 at Takaosan-ji (高雄山寺) In Vajrayana Buddhism or Mantrayana Buddhism, one enters into the path of Vajrayana Buddhism by receiving the four stages of tantric empowerments, or abhisheka: the vase abhisheka, secret abhisheka, prajnajnana abhisheka, and word abhisheka. url=https://www.lionsroar.com/pointing-out-ordinary-mind/}} url=https://www.lionsroar.com/see-the-true-nature-then-let-go-and-relax-in- that/}} In Vajrayana Buddhism, an abhiṣeka can be a method for performing pointing-out instructions, a way to offer blessings of a lineage to participants, or it can be an empowerment to begin a particular meditation practice.Hayward (2008) p.114 This empowerment ritual is present in Tibetan Buddhism as well as in Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and in Shingon Buddhism. The abhiṣeka was originally used as a consecration rite. Water from the four oceans was poured out of golden jars onto the head of royalty. It was used during a monarch's accession ceremony and also his investiture ceremony. =Tantric Buddhism= The abhiseka rite (wangkur) is a prelude for initiation into mystical teaching. There are four classes of abhiseka, each being associated with one of the four Tantras. They are master consecration, secret consecration, knowledge of prajna, and the fourth consecration. =Shingon Buddhism= The in Shingon Buddhism is the initiation rite used to confirm that a student of esoteric Buddhism has now graduated to a higher level of practice. The kanji used literally mean \\"pouring from the peak\\", which poetically describes the process of passing on the master's teachings to the student. The rite was popular in China during the Tang dynasty,Orzech, Charles, D. (2011). On the Subject of Abhiseka, Pacific World 3rd series, No 13, 113-128 and Kūkai, founder of Shingon, studied there extensively before introducing this rite to the Japanese Buddhist establishment of the time. A separate initiation rite exists for the general public called the , and symbolizes their initiation into esoteric Buddhism. This rite is generally only offered at Mount Kōya in Wakayama Prefecture in Japan, but it can be offered under qualified masters and under proper auspices outside Japan, albeit very rarely. The Shingon rite utilizes one of the two Mandala of the Two Realms, depending on the occasion. In esoteric ritual, after the student receives the samaya precepts, the teacher of the esoteric Buddhism assumes the role of the teacher, usually Mahavairocana Buddha, while the master and student repeat specific mantras in a form of dialogue taken from esoteric Buddhist sutras. The student, who is blindfolded, then throws a flower upon the Mandala that is constructed, and where it lands (i.e. which deity) helps dictate where the student should focus his devotion on the esoteric path. From there, the student's blindfold is removed and a vajra is placed in hand. Jainism Abhisheka in Jainism means the ritual of consecration of the image of Jina.

Some critics fear seasteads are designed more as a refuge for the wealthy to avoid taxes or other obligations. No one has yet created a structure on the high seas that has been recognized as a sovereign state. Proposed structures have included modified cruise ships, refitted oil platforms, decommissioned anti-aircraft platforms, and custom-built floating islands. As an intermediate step, the Seasteading Institute has promoted cooperation with an existing nation on prototype floating islands with legal semi-autonomy within the nation's protected territorial waters. On January 13, 2017, the Seasteading Institute signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with French Polynesia to create the first semi-autonomous \\"seazone\\" for a prototype, but later that year political changes driven by the French Polynesia presidential election led to the indefinite postponement of the project. French Polynesia formally backed out of the project and permanently cut ties with Seadsteading on March 14, 2018. The first single-family seastead was launched near Phuket, Thailand by Ocean Builders. Two months later, the Thai Navy claimed the seastead was a threat to Thai sovereignty. As of 2019, Ocean Builders says it will be building again in Panama, with the support of government officials. History Many architects and firms have created designs for floating cities, including Vincent Callebaut, Paolo Soleri and companies such as Shimizu, Ocean Builders and E. Kevin Schopfer. For a dozen years L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology, and his executive leadership became a maritime-based community named the Sea Organization (Sea Org). Beginning in 1967 with a complement of four ships, the Sea Org spent most of its existence on the high seas, visiting ports around the world for refueling and resupply. In 1975 much of these operations were shifted to land-based locations. Marshall Savage discussed building tethered artificial islands in his 1992 book The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps, with several color plates illustrating his ideas. Other historical predecessors and inspirations for seasteading include: * Oil platforms. * The Principality of Sealand, a micronation formed on a decommissioned sea fort near Suffolk, England. * Smaller floating islands in protected waters, such as Richart Sowa's Spiral Island * Floating communities, such as the Uru people on Lake Titicaca, the Tanka people in Aberdeen, Hong Kong, and the Makoko in Lagos, Nigeria. * The non-profit Women on Waves, which operates hospital ships that allow access to abortions for women in countries where abortions are subject to strict laws * The Republic of Rose Island, a short-lived micronation on a man-made platform in the Adriatic Sea, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) off the coast of the province of Rimini, Italy. * Pirate radio stations anchored in international waters, broadcasting to listeners on shore. At least two people independently coined the term seasteading: Ken Neumeyer in his book Sailing the Farm (1981) and Wayne Gramlich in his article \\"Seasteading – Homesteading on the High Seas\\" (1998). Gramlich's essay attracted the attention of Patri Friedman. The two began working together and posted their first collaborative book online in 2001. Their book explored many aspects of seasteading from waste disposal to flags of convenience. This collaboration led to the creation of the non-profit The Seasteading Institute (TSI) in 2008. In March 2019, a group called Ocean Builders claimed to have built the first seastead in International Waters, off the coast of the Thai island of Phuket. Thai Navy officials have charged them of violating Thai Sovereignty. In April 2019, the concept of floating cities as a way to cope with rising oceans was included in a presentation by the United Nations program UN-Habitat. As presented, they would be limited to sheltered waters.National Geographic: \\"Floating cities could ease global housing crunch, says UN\\" The Seasteading Institute The Seasteading Institute's \\"ClubStead\\" On April 15, 2008, Wayne Gramlich and Patri Friedman founded the 501(c)(3) non-profit The Seasteading Institute (TSI), an organization formed to facilitate the establishment of autonomous, mobile communities on seaborne platforms operating in international waters. Friedman and Gramlich noted that according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a country's Exclusive Economic Zone extends from shore. Beyond that boundary lie the high seas, which are not subject to the laws of any sovereign state other than the flag under which a ship sails. They proposed that a seastead could take advantage of the absence of laws and regulations outside the sovereignty of nations to experiment with new governance systems, and allow the citizens of existing governments to exit more easily. The project picked up mainstream exposure after PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel donated $500,000 in initial seed capital (followed by subsequent contributions). He also spoke out on behalf of its viability in his essay \\"The Education of a Libertarian\\". TSI received widespread media attention. In 2008, Friedman and Gramlich said they hoped to float the first prototype seastead in the San Francisco Bay by 2010 followed by a seastead in 2014. TSI did not meet these targets. In January 2009, the Seasteading Institute patented a design for a 200-person resort seastead, ClubStead, about a city block in size, produced by consultancy firm Marine Innovation & Technology. The ClubStead design marked the first major engineering analysis in the seasteading movement. In July 2012, the vessel Opus Casino was donated to the Seasteading Institute. = The Floating City Project = In the spring of 2013, TSI launched The Floating City Project. The project proposed to locate a floating city within the territorial waters of an existing nation, rather than the open ocean. TSI claimed that doing so would have several advantages by placing it within the international legal framework and making it easier to engineer and easier for people and equipment to reach. In October 2013, the Institute raised $27,082 from 291 funders in a crowdfunding campaign TSI used the funds to hire the Dutch marine engineering firm DeltaSync to write an engineering study for The Floating City Project. In September 2016 the Seasteading Institute met with officials in French Polynesiahttps://www.seasteading.org/2016/09/french-polynesia-open- seasteading-collaboration/ to discuss building a prototype seastead in a sheltered lagoon. On January 13, 2017, French Polynesia Minister of Housing Jean-Christophe Bouissou signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with TSI to create the first semi-autonomous \\"seazone\\". TSI spun off a for-profit company called \\"Blue Frontiers\\", which will build and operate a prototype seastead in the zone. On March 3, 2018, French Polynesia government said the agreement was \\"not a legal document\\" and had expired at the end of 2017. No action has been announced since. Other projects  =Jounieh Floating Island project (JFIP)= A proposal to build a \\"floating island\\" with a luxury hotel in Jounieh north of the Lebanese capital Beirut, was stalled as of 2015 because of concerns from local officials about environmental and regulatory matters.Middle East Eye: \\"Authorities block floating island\\"Report about project on MTV Lebanon television (in Arabic) =Blueseed= Blueseed was a company aiming to float a ship near Silicon Valley to serve as a visa-free startup community and entrepreneurial incubator. Blueseed founders Max Marty and Dario Mutabdzija met when both were employees of The Seasteading Institute. The project planned to offer living and office space, high-speed Internet connectivity, and regular ferry service to the mainland but as of 2014 the project was \\"on hold\\". Design proposals =Cruise ships= Cruise ships are a proven technology, and address most of the challenges of living at sea for extended periods of time. However, they're typically optimized for travel and short-term stay, not for permanent residence in a single location. Examples: * Blue Seed retro-fitted cruise ship. * Freedom Ship * MS Satoshi =Spar platform= Platform designs based on spar buoys, similar to oil platforms. In this design, the platforms rest on spars in the shape of floating dumbbells, with the living area high above sea level. Building on spars in this fashion reduces the influence of wave action on the structure. Examples: * TSI Clubstead * Evolo retrofitted oil platform * SeaPod = Modular island = András Győrfi's \\"The Swimming City\\" There are numerous seastead designs based around interlocking modules made of reinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete is used for floating docks, oil platforms, dams, and other marine structures. Examples: * The Floating City Project / Blue Frontiers. * Evolo Oceanscraper. * AT Design Office floating city concept. = Monolithic island = A single, monolithic structure that is not intended to be expanded or connected to other modules. Examples: * Evolo Seascraper * SeaOrbiter proposed oceangoing research vessel.  Criticism  Criticisms have been leveled at both the practicality and desirability of seasteading. Critics believe that creating governance structures from scratch is a lot harder than it seems. Also, seasteads would still be at risk of political interference from nation states. On a logistical level, without access to culture, travel, restaurants, shopping, and other amenities, seasteads could be too remote and too uncomfortable to be attractive to potential long-term residents. Building seasteads to withstand the rigors of the open ocean may prove uneconomical. Seastead structures may blight ocean views, their industry or farming may deplete their environments, and their waste may pollute surrounding waters. Some critics believe that seasteads will exploit both residents and the nearby population. Others fear that seasteads will mainly allow wealthy individuals to escape taxes, or to harm mainstream society by ignoring other financial, environmental, and labor regulations.  Conferences  The Seasteading Institute held its first conference in Burlingame, California, October 10, 2008. Forty-five people from nine countries attended. The second Seasteading conference was significantly larger, and held in San Francisco, California, September 28–30, 2009. The third Seasteading conference took place May 31 – June 2, 2012. In popular culture Seasteading has been imagined many times in novels as early as Jules Verne's 1895 science-fiction book Propeller Island (L'Île à hélice) about an artificial island designed to travel the waters of the Pacific Ocean, and as recent as 2003's The Scar, which featured a floating city, Armada. It has been a central concept in some movies, notably Waterworld (1995) and in TV series such as Stargate Atlantis, which had a complete floating city. And it is a common setting in video games, forming the premise of BioShock and BioShock 2, Brink, and Call of Duty: Black Ops II; and in anime, such as Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet which takes place mainly on a traveling city made of an interconnected fleet of ocean ships.

It is mainly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in people over the age of five as well as moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder in adults. Lisdexamfetamine is taken by mouth. In the United Kingdom it is usually less preferred than methylphenidate. Its effects generally begin within 2 hours and last for up to 12 hours. Common side effects of lisdexamfetamine include loss of appetite, anxiety, diarrhea, trouble sleeping, irritability, and nausea. Rare but serious side effects include mania, sudden cardiac death in those with underlying heart problems, and psychosis. It has a high potential for abuse per the DEA. Serotonin syndrome may occur if used with certain other medications. Its use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby and use during breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer. Lisdexamfetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that works after being converted by the body into dextroamphetamine. Chemically, lisdexamfetamine is composed of the amino acid L-lysine, attached to dextroamphetamine. Lisdexamfetamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007. A month's supply in the United Kingdom costs the British National Health Service about In the United States, the wholesale cost of this amount is about . In 2017, it was the 91st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than eight million prescriptions. It is a Schedule II controlled substance in the United Kingdom and a Schedule II controlled substance in the United States. Uses =Medical= 30mg Vyvanse capsules Lisdexamfetamine is used primarily as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and binge eating disorder; it has similar uses as those of other pharmaceutical amphetamines. Individuals over the age of 65 were not commonly tested in clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine for ADHD. =Enhancing performance= Contraindications Pharmaceutical lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to amphetamine products or any of the formulation's inactive ingredients. It is also contraindicated in patients who have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within the last 14 days. Amphetamine products are contraindicated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in people with a history of drug abuse, heart disease, or severe agitation or anxiety, or in those currently experiencing arteriosclerosis, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or severe hypertension. The USFDA advises anyone with bipolar disorder, depression, elevated blood pressure, liver or kidney problems, mania, psychosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, seizures, thyroid problems, tics, or Tourette syndrome to monitor their symptoms while taking amphetamine. Amphetamine is classified in US pregnancy category C. This means that detriments to the fetus have been observed in animal studies and adequate human studies have not been conducted; amphetamine may still be prescribed to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Amphetamine has also been shown to pass into breast milk, so the USFDA advises mothers to avoid breastfeeding when using it. Due to the potential for stunted growth, the USFDA advises monitoring the height and weight of children and adolescents prescribed amphetamines. Prescribing information approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration further contraindicates anorexia. Adverse effects Products containing lisdexamfetamine have a comparable drug safety profile to those containing amphetamine. Interactions * Acidifying Agents: Drugs that acidify the urine, such as ascorbic acid, increase urinary excretion of dextroamphetamine, thus decreasing the half-life of dextroamphetamine in the body. * Alkalinizing Agents: Drugs that alkalinize the urine, such as sodium bicarbonate, decrease urinary excretion of dextroamphetamine, thus increasing the half-life of dextroamphetamine in the body. * Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Concomitant use of MAOIs and central nervous system stimulants such as lisdexamfetamine can cause a hypertensive crisis. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Lisdexamfetamine is an inactive prodrug that is converted in the body to dextroamphetamine, a pharmacologically active compound which is responsible for the drug's activity. After oral ingestion, lisdexamfetamine is broken down by enzymes in red blood cells to form L-lysine, a naturally occurring essential amino acid, and dextroamphetamine. The conversion of lisdexamfetamine to dextroamphetamine is not affected by gastrointestinal pH and is unlikely to be affected by alterations in normal gastrointestinal transit times. The optical isomers of amphetamine, i.e., dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, are TAAR1 agonists and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors that can enter monoamine neurons; this allows them to release monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, among others) from their storage sites in the presynaptic neuron, as well as prevent the reuptake of these neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. Lisdexamfetamine was developed with the goal of providing a long duration of effect that is consistent throughout the day, with reduced potential for abuse. The attachment of the amino acid lysine slows down the relative amount of dextroamphetamine available to the blood stream. Because no free dextroamphetamine is present in lisdexamfetamine capsules, dextroamphetamine does not become available through mechanical manipulation, such as crushing or simple extraction. A relatively sophisticated biochemical process is needed to produce dextroamphetamine from lisdexamfetamine. As opposed to Adderall, which contains roughly equal parts of racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine is a single-enantiomer dextroamphetamine formula. Studies conducted show that lisdexamfetamine dimesylate may have less abuse potential than dextroamphetamine and an abuse profile similar to diethylpropion at dosages that are FDA-approved for treatment of ADHD, but still has a high abuse potential when this dosage is exceeded by over 100%. =Pharmacokinetics= Chemistry Lisdexamfetamine is a substituted amphetamine with an amide linkage formed by the condensation of dextroamphetamine with the carboxylate group of the essential amino acid L-lysine. The reaction occurs with retention of stereochemistry, so the product lisdexamfetamine exists as a single stereoisomer. There are many possible names for lisdexamfetamine based on IUPAC nomenclature, but it is usually named as or . The condensation reaction occurs with loss of water: :(S)- \\\\+ (S)- -> (S,S)- \\\\+ Amine functional groups are vulnerable to oxidation in air and so pharmaceuticals containing them are usually formulated as salts where this moiety has been protonated. This increases stability, water solubility, and, by converting a molecular compound to an ionic compound, increases the melting point and thereby ensures a solid product. In the case of lisdexamfetamine, this is achieved by reacting with two equivalents of methanesulfonic acid to produce the dimesylate salt, a water-soluble (792 mg mL−1) powder with a white to off-white color. : \\\\+ 2 -> =Comparison to other formulations= Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is one marketed formulation delivering dextroamphetamine. The following table compares the drug to other amphetamine pharmaceuticals. History, society, and culture Lisdexamfetamine was developed by New River Pharmaceuticals, who were bought by Takeda Pharmaceuticals through its acquisition of Shire Pharmaceuticals, shortly before it began being marketed. It was developed with the intention of creating a longer-lasting and less-easily abused version of dextroamphetamine, as the requirement of conversion into dextroamphetamine via enzymes in the red blood cells delays its onset of action, regardless of the route of administration. On 23 April 2008, the FDA approved lisdexamfetamine for treatment of ADHD in adults. On 19 February 2009, Health Canada approved 30 mg and 50 mg capsules of lisdexamfetamine for treatment of ADHD.Health Canada Notice of Compliance – Vyvanse. 19 February 2009, retrieved on 9 March 2009. In January 2015, lisdexamfetamine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of binge eating disorder in adults. Production quotas for 2016 in the United States were 29,750 kilograms. =Names= Lisdexamfetamine is a contraction of L-lysine-dextroamphetamine. As of July 2014 lisdexamfetamine was sold under the following brands: Elvanse, Samexid, Tyvense, Venvanse, and Vyvanse. Research =Depression= Some clinical trials that used lisdexamfetamine as an add-on therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for treatment-resistant depression indicated that this is no more effective than the use of an SSRI or SNRI alone. Other studies indicated that psychostimulants potentiated antidepressants, and were under-prescribed for treatment resistant depression. In those studies, patients showed significant improvement in energy, mood, and psychomotor activity. In February 2014, Shire announced that two late-stage clinical trials had shown that Vyvanse was not an effective treatment for depression.
