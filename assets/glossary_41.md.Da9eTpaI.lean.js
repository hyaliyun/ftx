An Irish Voluntary Aid Detachment nursing assistant in World War I, she is a companion of the Eighth Doctor. Character history Molly was born in 1891, and first appears in The Great War (2012). The Great War takes place during World War I, making her in her twenties at the time. She was the daughter of Patrick and Cathy O'Sullivan and had seven siblings, all of whom she outlived. Two of her brothers and her three sisters died before their fifth birthdays. She had two other brothers, Patrick and Liam. Patrick joined the British Army in World War I and was killed on his first day in France, while Liam remained in Ireland but was killed by an English sentry. On her second birthday, Molly became \\"lost in a storm\\", after which she returned home with unusually dark eyes. She was teased for her dark eyes when she was a child and when she first entered domestic service. However, this teasing ended when she began to punch the people who mocked her. Before the outbreak of World War I, she worked as a chambermaid for the Donaldson family in Eaton Place in London. She became friends with the Donaldsons' daughter Kitty, who viewed her as being the sister that she never had. When Kitty became a VAD in France, Molly did likewise as she knew that Kitty needed someone to protect her. After several months serving in France, Kitty contracted an infection from one of the soldiers whom she was treating. She was eventually killed by the renegade Time Lord Kotris and the Daleks. Molly met the Eighth Doctor in France, with whom she began to travel after they were chased across no man's land by the Daleks. The first place the Doctor took Molly was Dunkirk in 1941. They were not there long before the Daleks appeared once more, chasing them across the town. They were also chased to London in 1972, and the planet Halalka. Shortly after leaving Halalka, Molly and the Doctor seemingly arrived on Skaro, where they discovered that the Daleks had become peaceful, after they caused the extinction of the Time Lords. However, it was later revealed that this was a simulation generated on their behalf. The Doctor and Molly were directed to Srangor by the Time Lords, where Molly discovered that she had been implanted with retro-genitor particles by Kotris while she was lost during her second birthday, the effect of which gave Molly her unusually dark eyes. The effects of this were erased when Straxus ‚Äî a younger version of Kotris ‚Äî was killed, thus erasing Kotris and everything he accomplished from history. She departed the TARDIS after it materialised in France during World War I. Molly realised that with Kotris having been erased from history, Kitty would still be alive and that she had to continue taking care of her as she promised. Molly returned to London and stayed at 107 Baker Street. In 1918 she met the Doctor again, and they travelled to the cryo-ship Orpheus, where Molly met Liv Chenka for the first time. Shortly after, the ship came under attack by the Eminence, a gaseous entity and psychic force that could control the minds of any being it came into contact with, and it began to possess the crew. After defeating the Eminence, Molly and the Doctor were joined on their travels by Liv. Molly, Liv and the Doctor's next stop was London in the 1970s, where Molly helped the Doctor defeat the Master and the Eminence. After they were defeated, Molly stayed behind in 107 Baker Street and awaited the Doctor's return from the human colony planet Nixyce VII. One night she heard a knock at the door, and was kidnapped by the Master and his own companion, Sally Armstrong. The Master edited Molly's memories, replacing the Doctor with the Master, creating a sense of trust between them. The Master then made her become part of his experiment to pass some of her retro-genitor particles onto other humans, so that they could fall under the Eminence's control, and allied himself with the Eminence, allowing both of them to conquer Earth. He subsequently activated the retro-genitor particles in the humans and asserted his psychic influence over them. The Master also used her to create the Grand Administrator of the Earth, Walter Vincent, based on her father. The Eighth Doctor helped a group of humans overcome the Master's influence and stopped his plans. Whilst the Celestial Intervention Agency erased his work from history, the Master escaped in his TARDIS. Afterwards, Molly parted company from the Doctor, after it was deemed she would be unsafe travelling with him, they parted ways as she was to be returned to her proper place in time. In a new timeline created by the Daleks, she was in Moscow, 1961 where she was known under the name Mary Carter. While there, a Sontaran named Rastel ordered her to look after the Eighth Doctor. She didn't recognise him at first, but this was a deception, as the Master wanted her to stabilise the timeline. She knew that something was wrong with time when the Daleks invaded Earth as she had known the future. The Dalek Time Controller took Liv and Molly to the Eye of Orion to see Markus Schriver's final experiment, which was the birth of the Eminence. She sacrificed her own life so that the Time Controller could die, as because of the retro-genitor particles, she was still linked with the Time Controller; if either of them died, they would both die. She then became part of the Eminence, and used the Time Controller's link with the time vortex to send the Eminence to the end of the universe. Other appearances The Eighth Doctor mentions Molly by name (along with other audio companions) before regenerating into the War Doctor in the 2013 mini-episode, \\"The Night of the Doctor\\". Molly was the last companion that he remembered.

Much, through not all, of her role in the Doctor's life was featured in a series of audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions based on the series, where she was voiced by Julie Cox. In these audio plays (originally released in 2009 and 2011), she is a companion of the Eighth Doctor. In 2020, Mary appeared in the television series proper for the first time, where she meets the Thirteenth Doctor. Character history Mary Shelley's appearances with the Eighth Doctor were the fruition of a nearly decade-long running gag in the Eighth Doctor's audio adventures. Since his first audio adventure, Storm Warning, the Eighth Doctor had been dropping hints of a friendship with Shelley; in Storm Warning, he had a copy of Shelley's Frankenstein in his TARDIS library, inscribed to him by her, and after he read the preface aloud, he mentioned that what Mary wrote wasn't the entire truth about what happened. Mary's first appearance is in \\"Mary's Story\\", a story part of the audio anthology The Company of Friends. Mary initially encounters the Eighth Doctor in Switzerland in June 1816 and witnesses him apparently coming back to life after being dead, providing inspiration for Frankenstein. Mary then leaves with the Doctor and travels with him in his journeys. In The Silver Turk, hours after leaving Lake Geneva, the Doctor takes Mary to Vienna on 11 September 1873, where they encounter two Cybermen. In The Witch from the Well, she visits Lincolnshire in 2011 and in the 1650s, where she encounters some Varaxils who are looking for a human who could channel Odic energy. She also meets Aleister Portillon, Earl of Wetstone, who is obsessed with Lord Byron and has a biography on Mary herself. During her travels with the Doctor, Mary meets Axons and King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After their adventure in Army of Death, Mary decides to leave the Doctor's company, as she fears his \\"other companion\\", death. In the television episode \\"The Haunting of Villa Diodati\\", the Thirteenth Doctor and companions Ryan, Yaz and Graham visit Switzerland in 1816 and, despite the Doctor's warning not to influence the course of history, become involved in events with the Lone Cyberman, who has come from the future. No part of this story acknowledges the events of the Big Finish audio stories. (Morgan Jeffery of Radio Times suggests the events of \\"The Haunting of Villa Diodati\\" constitute a change to the course of history, overwriting the Eighth Doctor's adventures with Mary.)

The Natural History Museum is an independent institution financed with contributions from the Ministry of Culture, Aarhus Municipality, Aarhus University and revenues from visitors. The museum is situated in the Aarhus University campus in the district Midtbyen, but also operates a field laboratory and education centre, the Molslaboratoriet, in Mols Bjerge National Park on Djursland. The Natural History Museum is controlled by a board of directors composed of representatives from Aarhus University, Aarhus Municipality, the Natural History Society for Jutland, the local business community and the employees. The museum conducts research in a number of areas with focus on entomology, freshwater ecology, earth biology, fauna and bioacoustics.  History  The first natural history museum in Aarhus was mentioned in 1838 when it was given 2 rooms in the Aarhus Cathedral School. The school collection was absorbed into the museum collection at this time. In 1850 the members of the organization behind the museum had all left the city and the collection was taken over by the cathedral school and possibly donated to the Natural History Society for Jutland at some later point. In the early 20th century efforts were underway to establish a university in Aarhus. A group of local businessmen lobbying to get the university built had created a zoological collection based on donations from the Natural History Society for Jutland and funds donated by the president of the Aarhus Oil Mill, Frederik Lausen. In January 1919 the city council received a request from the group to find a place to store the collection. The collection was moved in L√¶ss√∏esgades School and a board of directors was created with members from the organization and the municipality. The museum was from the beginning an independent institution. The first 7 years the city funded the museum through the budget item \\"Preparations for a university in Jutland\\" but in 1928 the museum got a funding item for itself and the state stepped in with further funding. Since the museum was created in connection with a future university it seemed reasonable to also place the museum in the university buildings so students and faculty had easy access. In May 1941 the museum opened for the first time. The building was drawn by C.F. M√∏ller like the rest of the university. The university did not initially have a faculty for the natural sciences so the museum was established with its own scientific department so interested scientists could have a laboratory to work in.  Collections  The museum have extensive collections of mammals, birds, skeletons, animal tracks, springtails, mollusks and corral. The collections in the museum are the second-largest of its kind in Denmark both in regards to size of the collection and size of the exhibition area- The largest parts of the collections are stored with only a small segment in the exhibition. The collections are used in ongoing research which mainly takes place in Denmark. Parts of the collections are on display in four permanent exhibitions and changing special exhibitions. Fostre.tif Axolotl.jpg L√∏vegruppe.jpg Tigerkamp.jpg  Mission  The goals of the museum is specified in the Articles of Association which is reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Culture. In part, it states the goals of the museum to be to further research in the natural sciences and knowledge of scientific research. The museum conducts and supports research projects, maintains and expands its collections and the publicly available exhibitions, collaborates with other research institutions, the Institute of Biology of Aarhus University and different categories of elementary schools with the aim to contribute to education in the natural sciences.

Costello was born into a family of communist activists, as the son of Bella Lerner and Paddy Costello. Paddy left the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1939, but Bella remained a member her entire life. Late in World War II, Mick's parents moved to work with the New Zealand diplomatic mission in Moscow, and Mick was educated at a state school in the city, where he became fluent in Russian.Graham Stevenson, \\"Costello Mick\\", Compendium of Communist Biography The family returned to Britain when Mick was fourteen, and he studied at the University of Manchester, becoming President of the Students' Union. He joined the CPGB in 1956, becoming known as an expert on economics and a journalist on the Morning Star, a daily newspaper associated with the party. He wrote two books expounding party views: The Communist View, published in 1969, and Workers' Participation in the Soviet Union, which came out in 1977. In 1979, Costello was elected as the CPGB's National Industrial Organiser, building links with trade unions and becoming what the New Statesman later described as \\"certainly the best-known communist in Britain, probably the cleverest, and easily the party's best linguist\\".Francis Beckett, \\"The Sixth Man\\", New Statesman, 18 October 2007 In this role, it was suggested in several newspapers that he was working as a spy for the Soviet Union, possibly even following his father's footsteps; a charge which Costello denies, and Francis Beckett notes that his role would not be good cover for a spy, and would be unlikely to enable him to discover important secrets. Costello took part in a major debate in 1982 with Martin Jacques, editor of Marxism Today, who had criticised the shop stewards' movement. Concerned about the party's direction, Costello left his post to become full-time industrial correspondent of the Morning Star, serving in the role through the UK miners' strike. Costello resigned from the CPGB in the mid-1980s, and started the Costello Trading Consultancy, making deals in Russia in fields from oil to fast food and artificial limbs. He also set up an exchange scheme for Russian police and those in the Metropolitan Police.Nick Cohen, \\"Goodbye Stalin, hello Mammon: Once he was Red Mick, now capitalism calls.

He is a Bolivian drug dealer and the chief supplier of cocaine for Tony Montana. Only when Sosa was betrayed did his relationship with Tony Montana end. Sosa is portrayed by Paul Shenar in the film and voiced by Robert Davi in the game. He is based on the Bolivian drug trafficker Roberto Su√°rez Gom√©z. Overview =Scarface (1983)= Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) sends Tony Montana and Omar Suarez to make a drug deal with Sosa who asks them to guarantee the buying of a certain amount of cocaine every month. After some issues, Montana promises Sosa to talk with Lopez about sharing the risk. When Sosa is informed that Suarez was previously a police informant, Suarez is beaten by Sosa's henchmen and then hanged to death from a helicopter, which Tony witnesses. Sosa gives immediate respect to Tony due to his honesty and straight-forward demeanor, even agreeing that Omar fooling Lopez \\"could happen to anyone\\". When Lopez hears of the developments, he refuses to believe that Omar was a \\"stoolie\\" and even suspects that Tony has some ulterior motives. Lopez and Tony separate after the argument and the latter proposes marriage to Lopez's girlfriend Elvira Hancock. When Lopez becomes aware of Tony's aspirations regarding Elvira, he sends two hit-men to have him killed. The plan backfires and Tony kills the two hit-men. Tony then goes to Lopez and has his right-hand-man Manny kill Lopez after Lopez confesses to hiring the hitmen to kill Tony. Tony becomes a drug lord in Miami and for a while, enjoys a period of mutual business prosperity with Sosa. When Tony Montana is arrested for tax evasion, Sosa offers to use his government contacts to keep Montana from going to prison. In exchange, Montana is to assassinate a journalist who is threatening to expose Sosa's illicit activities. Montana agrees and heads to New York City, but when he sees that the journalist has his family with him in the car they want to blow up, he refuses to kill them. Sosa's henchman Alberto \\"The Shadow\\" ignores Montana's instructions and is therefore shot in the head fatally by him. Later, when Montana reaches his home, Sosa calls him angrily and inquires about the incident. Montana offends him and in retaliation the infuriated Sosa sends his mercenaries to Montana's home to finish him. Despite the casualties he inflicts, Montana is ultimately killed in the attack when Sosa's personal hitman \\"The Skull\\" sneaks up behind him, shoots Montana in the back with a double barrel shotgun, causing him to fall into the fountain with the symbolic \\"The World Is Yours\\" globe sign above it. This is notably similar to the final scene of the original 1932 Scarface film. =Scarface: The World Is Yours (2006)= In Scarface: The World is Yours the ending of the movie was altered to establish that Tony won the climactic battle against Sosa's men, escaping before the police showed up, although Sosa had succeeded in ending Tony's drug empire. Tony quits using cocaine and the game focuses on Tony's efforts to rebuild his old drug empire on the ashes of his old one and to exact revenge upon Sosa. Sosa is not seen (though his voice is heard through much of the game) until in the final mission where he held a meeting with Gaspar Gomez and George Sheffield regarding the fact that Tony has taken over all of Miami and is now after them. Montana confronts Sosa in his living room after killing Gomez and Sheffield, and wiping out Sosa's men in his mansion in Bolivia. Sosa tells Montana he warned him not to betray him, but Montana did, referring to the incident with the journalist in the film. Sosa says that in their business, sometimes children have to be killed, particularly so \\"heroes don't go on 60 Minutes.\\", referring to the journalist who on national TV named him and many of his allies as reputed drug traffickers. Montana then executes Sosa by shooting him 30 times with an AK-47, unloading the entire magazine, leaving his bullet riddled corpse slumped against his couch. Tony Montana heads back to Miami, Florida where he proceeds to celebrate his control of the city's drug trade, Sosa's assassination, and the destruction of Sosa's drug empire. Reception, influence and legacy The Day wrote that Shenar had portrayed the character with \\"a kind of glorious and refined sleaze\\". Complex has ranked Sosa as 27th in its list of 50 best villains in movie history. Robert Davi voiced Sosa in the 2006 video game. Rapper Pitbull said in 2014 that \\"I wanted to be Sosa ‚Äì educated, good-looking, a good dresser\\". The song \\"Criminology\\" by Wu-Tang Clan rapper Raekwon, from his debut album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., begins with a dialogue between Montana and Sosa where Sosa calls the former a \\"fucking little monkey\\". Rapper Chief Keef, popularly named his fifth child \\"Sno\\" meaning \\"The White Sosa\\". Montana's killing, ordered by Sosa, has been listed by Complex as the 1st one in its \\"Top 50 Movie Assassinations\\" list. The character Colonel Sanders in the South Park episode \\"Medicinal Fried Chicken\\" is similar to Sosa.

The game is the official video game of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and was released worldwide on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360 and Xbox One on 4 September 2015. Game modes include the official Rugby World Cup tournament and a Custom Cup mode allowing players to create their own version of the tournament. All twenty teams that have qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup appear, but only ten of them are fully licensed. The England team is one of those unlicensed due to their likeness already appearing on rival game Rugby Challenge 3. An edit function allows fake player names for unlicensed teams to be edited, but these only apply for exhibition and custom cup modes, the Rugby World Cup game mode retains the fake names. Using the same control system that had been implemented in Rugby15, the game has been overwhelmingly panned by reviewers. The lack of official squad licensing, no licensed stadiums, absence of an online game mode, poor graphics and outdated gameplay presentation has also not gone unnoticed. Reception Rugby World Cup 2015 was universally panned by critics, with reviews noting that the game contained few improvements over HB Studios' similarly-criticized Rugby 15‚Äîand believing that the game was rushed so that it could be released in time for the tournament itself. IGN gave the game a 1.5 out of 10, noting major bugs, that the game's AI was still poorly implemented, that it still used pre-determined outcomes for tackles, and that while less buggy than the same system in Rugby 15, the ruck implementation had an \\"emphasis on speediness [that] results in a lot of frustration and an overall lack of control.\\" In conclusion, it was felt that the game was essentially a re-branded version of Rugby 15 rushed out in time for the actual World Cup. A reviewer also noted that a feature which uses statistical data to simulate matches between two sides sometimes resulted in implausible results, arguing that \\"nobody is going to complain if one-thousand times out of one- thousand South Africa crushes Japan\\" because \\"in no reality does that happen\\". Ironically, during the actual Rugby World Cup, Japan would notably upset South Africa in an opening round match. Gamesradar was somewhat more positive on Rugby World Cup 2015 in comparison to Rugby 15, noting some improvements to the overall gameplay and mechanics that made the game feel more like actual rugby union, including television-styled instant replays, and being \\"the first rugby title in years which rewards running hard and straight, rather prancing sideways in an attempt to glitch past defences\\". However, the game was otherwise criticized for otherwise only featuring minor improvements over Rugby 15, commenting that \\"there's nothing here that suggests an understanding of scrums‚Äîwhich is forgivable, since most international referees don't either‚Äîbut there's certainly no attempt to twist the complex battle of binding, shoving and probably-biting into something that belongs in a game. Instead, it's reduced to 'hook' and 'push'.\\" It was also pointed out that half of the game's teams (including, ironically, tournament host England) were not licensed and thus composed of fictional players, and that none of the tournament's actual venues were featured either. Giving Rugby World Cup 2015 2 out of 5 stars, what improvements were present in the game were considered \\"nothing more than a fig leaf which barely covers the game's otherwise gruesome nudity.\\" References Category:2015 video games Category:Windows games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games Category:Rugby union video games video game Category:Video games developed in Canada ","title":"Rugby World Cup 2015 (video game)"},{"id":"47746263","text":"Florencia Molinero and Stephanie Vogt were the defending champions, but Molinero chose not to participate.

His father was killed in a car accident when he was three years old, prompting him, his mother and three siblings to move to his grandparents' home, where he grew up. By the time he was 10 years old, he and his brother Sammy accompanied their grandfather to sell bananas and used clothing at the market in Santa Lucia.\\"Jimmy Morales: Guatemala's clown who went on to become president,\\" Telegraph.\\"Jimmy Morales used to do blackface comedy.

Morales also holds a master's degree in Strategic Studies with specialization in Security and Defense from Mariano G√°lvez University. He furthered his studies in Strategic Studies at Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. Morales rose to fame as a TV comedian, starring in the series Moralejas (\\"Morals\\") alongside his brother Sammy. He formally changed his name from James Ernesto Morales Cabrera to Jimmy Morales by deed poll in 2011. Morales has been married for three decades to Hilda Patricia Marroqu√≠n, and has three children. Political career In 2011, he ran as mayoral candidate in Mixco in the Guatemala City suburbs for the small right-wing Action for National Development party. He came in third. In 2013, Morales joined the small National Convergence Front (FCN/Nation), and became its Secretary- General. Presidency =Presidential campaign= In 2015, Morales was nominated as the FCN's presidential candidate. His priorities were fighting corruption, and dealing with chronic malnutrition, low education levels, and insecurity. His slogan was \\"Neither corrupt, nor a thief\\" (Ni corrupto, ni ladr√≥n). He ran on a platform of conservative values, and against corruption. He identifies as a nationalist, supports the death penalty, opposes abortion and legalized drugs, and denies that a genocide against the Ixil Maya took place.\\"Guatemala just elected a comedian with zero political experience to be president\\", Vox. He was initially considered an outsider, but surprisingly led the field in the first round of the election, qualifying for a runoff alongside former First Lady Sandra Torres. Morales' success came after both former vice president Roxana Baldetti and outgoing president Otto P√©rez Molina had to step down, and were arrested on fraud and corruption charges (the La L√≠nea corruption case). =Administration= Morales with Donald Trump at White House in 2019. In the runoff, Morales defeated Torres in a landslide, taking 67.4 percent of the vote.Official results Morales' success was viewed as a sign of the distrust of many Guatemalans towards the traditional political elite that ruled the country for decades. Voter anger and military support helped him win the presidency against more experienced politicians who voters felt were tainted by a corrupt political system. Morales with President of Mexico Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. On December 24, 2017, Morales announced that he planned to move the Guatemalan embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He became the second national leader to announce a decision to make such a move, after the President of the United States, Donald Trump, made a similar announcement on December 6. Morales with President of Israel Reuven Rivlin. On June 18, 2018, the Morales government was widely criticized for its slow action in favor of Guatemalans affected by the American policy of separating immigrant families; this caused the dismissal of the presidential spokesman Heinz Heimann who a day before his removal from office said that the government respected the policy of President Trump. Controversies =Arrest of relatives= In January 2017, Morales' older brother and close adviser Samuel \\"Sammy\\" Morales, as well as one of Morales' sons, Jos√© Manuel Morales, were arrested on corruption and money laundering charges. According to media reports, the arrests prompted several large protests of up to 15,000 people demanding for President Morales' removal. The most recent took place in September 2017. Morales refused to step down.\\"Protests Erupt in Guatemala Over Laws to Dilute Antigraft Campaign\\" - The New York Times\\"Crisis flares in Guatemala over corruption and organised crime\\"  The Guardian =CICIG and illegal donations= In August 2017, Morales ordered the expulsion of Colombian Iv√°n Vel√°squez, commissioner of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), after it began \\"investigating claims that his party took illegal donations, including from drug-traffickers\\" and asked \\"congress to strip him of immunity from prosecution.\\"\\"Guatemala‚Äôs president tried to expel the U.N. commissioner who announced he was under investigation\\" - The Washington Post The Constitutional Court of Guatemala blocked the move.

In September 2017, the Congress of Guatemala refused to strip Morales of his immunity, rejecting commissioner Vel√°squez's suggestion. =Responsibility bonus= In September 2017, it was revealed that the Ministry of Defense, headed by Williams Mansilla, had been paying President Morales a $7,300 per month bonus since December 2016, in addition to his regular salary. The payments from the defense ministry were referred to as a \\"Bonus for Extraordinary Responsibility.\\" Mansilla resigned from office soon after the payments were revealed to the public. He was later arrested and charged with corruption in January 2018, relating to the special bonus to Morales. President Morales denied the bonuses were illegal, but did return approximately $60,000 to the government. =Expenses= The acquisition by the government of services and luxury items for the president using public monies caused controversy, although he indicated not being personally involved in those expenses. =Sexual abuse accusations= A former cabinet minister accused Jimmy Morales of having sexually abused young female public workers with complicity of other government officials. = Belize mobilization = Guatemalan Defense Minister Williams Mansilla confirmed on 22 April 2016 the deployment of 3,000 soldiers to the Guatemalan border with Belize, after a shooting incident on Belize territory with army weapons resulted in the death of a 13-year-old boy and the wounding of his 11-year-old brother, as well as their 48-year-old father.\\"Guatemala despliega 3.000 soldados en la frontera con Belice\\", El Pa√≠s, 22 Abril 2016 (accessed 22 April 2016) Honours * Order of Brilliant Jade, Grand Cordon, awarded by President of the Republic of China Tsai Ing-wen on 11 January 2017. * Honorary doctorate, awarded by Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in November 2016.

In 2002 she was appointed Director of Research and Development at NABDA and later served as the Director of Bioentrepreneurship from 2004 to 2005. Ogbadu also served in an acting capacity as the Director General/CEO of NABDA for three months in 2005, and afterwards became head of the department of Food and Industrial Biotechnology at the NABDA from 2005 to 2011. She also served as director of research from 2011 until 2013, when she was appointed to her current position. Ogbadu initiated the technology transfer on the \\"Temporary Immersion Bioreactor System\\" from AZUTECNIA of Cuba into Nigeria for mass production of elite plantlets. She also facilitated the signing of a memorandum of understanding on vaccine production between Finlay of Cuba and Nigeria (FMST, Federal University of Technology Minna and CDC co-opted) in early 2013. During her period of service as the acting Director General, Ogbadu restored Nigeria's membership of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. Other biotechnology projects were initiated through collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations under the South South cooperation during this period. At the outset of the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic, NABDA under her leadership developed probes and primers for detecting Ebola virus disease. The kits were capable of diagnoses within 24 hours of contacting the virus, even before symptoms start manifesting, thereby preventing the spread of the disease. This was achieved in collaboration with the South Korean biotechnology company Bioneer. Under two years of her leadership as Director General she succeeded in pushing for the passage of Nigeria's Biosafety Bill, which had been in limbo since its inception in 2002, into law. Similarly the Biotechnology Bill has received approval of the Federal Executive Council within the same period and is now before the National Assembly. A five-year biotechnology Strategic Plan has also been developed for the first time and is currently being implemented.  Publications  Ogbadu has published over 40 refereed journal/book of her research findings, 87 percent of which are in reputable international journals and the rest in local journals/books of high ranking. Ogbadu has contributed chapters to the Elsevier Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology. She has presented over 22 Seminar and Conference Papers at various scientific gatherings.

This group constructed a synagogue on Wilson Road, near Hunters Bar, in 1930.Armin Krausz, Sheffield Jewry, p.128 Sukkah, with roof part-open The building was designed by Mansell Jenkinson in a classical style, featuring a portico in the Doric order.

During World War II, the city centre synagogue was destroyed by bombing, and much of its community came to worship at Wilson Road. However, they later established a new building, Kingfield Hall, in Nether Edge. The Jewish population of the city reached about 1,500 in the 1950s, but then entered a long decline. In the 1960s, the two communities joined together, and in 2000, the resulting independent congregation moved to a new building at the Kingfield Hall site.

1668 ‚Äì 15 November 1750) was a German dance teacher, musician and composer. Today his notability rests primarily on the pantalon, a keyboard instrument which he invented and which subsequently came to be seen by some as a precursor of the modern Pianoforte. Life Hebenstreit was born in Eisleben, a short distance west of Leipzig, in 1668. His father, described in one source as a \\"Th√ºrmer\\" (look-out man), died in 1678. On 29 January 1691 Hebenstreit entered the University of Wittenberg. By 1697 he was employed in Leipzig as a violinist, keyboard musician and dancing master (i.e. teacher). It must have been at this time that, during one of his regular visits to Jean-Baptiste Volumier in Berlin, he is reported by Johann Kuhnau to have spent a lot of time practising his keyboard skills on an enlarged type of hammered dulcimer which he had constructed himself. In 1697 he was obliged to leave Leipzig in order to escape his creditors, and took a position as a private tutor in Merseburg, which gave him the opportunity to develop his instrument: shortly afterwards he was invited to demonstrate it to the court in Dresden. Hebenstreit was able to return to Leipzig, his debts apparently paid off. Between 1698 and 1703 he was contracted by The Duke to work on the drama and music at the court of Weissenfels. In 1705 he traveled with his giant dulcimer to France. According to Johann Mattheson writing in his Critica musica, quoting a French source, it was during this visit that the French king Louis XIV was so impressed both with the instrument and with Hebenstreit's mastery of it that he rechristened it \\"Le Pantalon\\": the name stuck. On returning from France, Hebenstreit set about finding a suitable court appointment in his home region. In 1707 he took a post as a musical director and dancing master in Eisenach at the court of Saxe-Eisenach. His virtuosity as a violinist was commended. In 1708 or 1709 Georg Philipp Telemann took a position at the same court, being appointed Kapellmeister in August 1709. Having been passed over for the top job, Pantaleon left the Eisenach Court soon afterwards, probably still in 1709. Surviving records leave little doubt about Telemann's own admiration for Pantaleon's exceptional dexterity as a keyboard and violin performer (\\"eine ungemeine Geschicklichkeit\\") which, writing in 1718, Telemann implied exceeded his own talent.In 1718 Telemann wrote: \\"Monsieur Pantlon, sage ich, hatte nebst der Erfahrung auf vielerley Instrumenten zugleich in der Frantz√∂sischen Music und Composition eine ungemeine Geschicklichkeit, woraus ich mehr Vortheil gesch√∂pfet als ich hier anzuf√ºhren verm√∂gend bin.\\" Telemann himself would leave the Eisenach Court in 1712. On 11 May 1714 Hebenstreit accepted an invitation to take a position at the Electoral Court in Dresden, the principal court of Saxony. His annual remuneration was 1200 Thalers, described in sources as \\"unusually high\\" (\\"mit einem ungew√∂hnlich hohen Gehalt\\"). He was, according to court payroll records, in charge of chamber music. Johann Kuhnau, the man who preceded Bach himself at Leipzig, is on record with the view that Pantaleon Hebenstreit was well worth his salary, however.\\"Ungeachtet sich dieser excellente Meister des Jahres etwann einmahl vor dem K√∂nige h√∂ren lasset, verdienet doch seine unverdrossene M√ºhe, die er von Jugend auff, bis hierher gewendet, ‚Ä¶ dieses, und noch ein mehrers.\\" Johann Kuhnau, quoted in print by Johann Mattheson Hebestreit's duties in charge of court music included playing the organ in the Chapel Royal, but in 1733, now in his late 60s and with his eyesight beginning to fail, he passed responsibility for this aspect of his work over to his star pupil Johann Richter. Richter had already taken over some of his other court responsibilities including choir training, formally in 1729, and it appears that by now Hebestreit was reducing his workload. In 1740 he was appointed a privy councillor. On 15 November 1750 Pantaleon Hebenstreit died. He was buried three days later in Dresden's Johanniskirche. Reputation Although, three centuries later, the Pantalon which he invented is largely forgotten, it would be wrong to think that Pantaleon Hebenstreit's reputation, which extended far beyond the confines of the Holy Roman Empire, died with him. In 1772 the English musicologist Charles Burney spotted the \\"famous Pantalon\\" in the house of Christian Sigmund Binder, who had succeeded Richter as head of court music. It was explained that the Duke felt unable to \\"let the instrument go\\". Hebenstreit's most notable pupils were the two Viennese Pantaleonists, and .

Mandikian launched her career in England. She took on leading roles in London and Edinburgh. In the 1980s she became the assistant director of the Greek National Opera. Career Mandikian was born in Izmir, Turkey in 1924. Mandikian's parents, Krikor Mandikian and Beatrike Ananian, were survivors of the Armenian Genocide. The family fled to Athens, Greece, and Mandikian was sent to the Athens Conservatory where she studied under Elvira de Hidalgo. When she was 15 she made her operatic d√©but with Maria Callas. In 1948 she travelled to Britain to meet the scholar and composer Egon Wellesz. Wellesz arranged for her to give a recital that included Greek music written over two millennia. This included Delphic Hymns written in about 128 B.C.John Warrack, ‚ÄòMandikian, Arda (1924?‚Äì2009)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2013 accessed 7 Sept 2015 She also appeared in Wellesz's Incognita in Oxford.Arda Mandikian, Naxos.com, Retrieved 7 September 2015 A demonstration of her singing led to regular work. In 1953 she had leading roles in operas in both Paris and London. In that year she was singing in London's Covent Garden in Peter Grimes by Benjamin Britten and in 1954 she appeared in Le Coq d‚Äôor by Rimsky-Korsakov again at the Royal Opera House. In 1954 she sang the First Delphic Hymn at the Aldeburgh Festival. This inspired Benjamin Britten to include a similar idea in his The Turn of the Screw. Britten created the role of the ghost Miss Jessel especially for Mandikian. It has been said that Britten made the part so close to Mandikian that it \\"sounds like Arda, whoever sings it\\". In the 1960s her mother became ill and she went back to look after her. Whilst she was back in Greece a military junta seized power there and Mandikian spoke out against them. She could not sing opera as she would not take work in Greece and she feared that she would be exiled if she left the country. The Greek junta's dictatorship ended in 1974. From 1974 to 1980 Mandikian was assistant director of the Greek National Opera. She worked with Christos Lambrakis.Arda Mandikian obituary, The Guardian, Retrieved 7 September 2015 Mandikian died in Athens in 2009.

Biography  Andrino's childhood was spent in the city of Madrid. She lived in Ibiza, London and Madrid. She studied fine art in Universidad Complutense de Madrid and she has the doctorade of sculpture. Andrino's art has come to America, working with galleries of Valliart, in Miami. She was also selected by her alma mater, along with three other artists, to represent the University at the College of Spain in Paris (Quatre Peinture et sculpture).  Style  Andrino use different materials for her works, among which may be mentioned paper mache, cement, sand, cardboard, wood and iron, among others. For six years her work has addressed the issue of the crowds, human groups and what areas they occupy. This has produced a dramatic piece of art, because the fact that it has human content also makes this dramatic content. It also delves into the world of words. The artist defines her work saying that the sculpture is pictorial and sculptural painting and the painting is first and second is relief. The predominant color in her works is red, which purports to represent the drama of the crowds on a sea of white. This color, red, has been key to the life of Andrino, it has touched many aspects of her life. According to her, it is the color that gives coherence to their works, acts as a wire and you could say that is the hallmark of the artist herself, that is, the color that characterizes her works. The artist is moved by emotions and sees the red like one of them, giving a fiery and blood symbolism. The material often used in her sculpture is cement, but also uses sand. For her, these materials give a telluric aspect of her work and the link to the summers of her childhood in the home of her grandparents, representing humility. Her sculptures are of a large size, full scale. In all aspects of her work is the theme of childhood. Cement represents the playground and park, where children have fun together and learn traditional games. These sculptures represent the public space, the place where children should have fun freely. Childhood is a key theme in her work because it is the first period of life, which is appropriate, and that marks adulthood as Andrino. The main influential painter and sculptor in her work is the German neo-expressionist Anselm Kiefer, who got the idea of large volumes. Andrino considers that the sculptures of large volumes should be exposed in large public platforms and establishes a direct correlation size / expression, that is, to express great feelings, emotions and sensations need to do it through large sculptures to be exhibited in large spaces.

On leaving school, he worked in his hometown's coalmine, whilst also playing for Junior club Glencraig Celtic. Johnstone signed for Celtic in January 1909, but made only one appearance in his first season at Parkhead. However, he soon became a regular in the side and eventually made over 240 appearances, scoring 29 goals.(Celtic player) Johnstone, Peter, FitbaStats During his career he played in a variety of roles at forward, midfield and defence. His main position was at outside-right, but in later years played more often in defence. He won three Scottish Cup medals as well as four League championships with Celtic and was a mainstay in their side for several years. Johnstone was never capped for Scotland but he did play for the Scottish League side in 1914 against the Irish League,(SFL player) Peter Johnstone, London Hearts Supporters Club as well as representing Glasgow on two occasions.

He first joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders but later was transferred to the 6th Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders. Johnstone continued to occasionally play for Celtic during his army training, and in September 1916 travelled overnight from England to help his teammates defeat Rangers in a Glasgow Cup tie. Johnstone died in May 1917 when the 6th Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders attempted to capture a chemicals factory near Rouex in north-west France during the Battle of Arras.

In 2000, Robertson closed his fund, and entrusted Coleman with over $25 million to manage, making him one of the 30 or more so-called \\"Tiger Cubs\\", fund managers who started their fund management careers with Tiger Management. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Chase since he was a young boy on Long Island and a good friend of my son Spencer,‚Äù [Julian] Robertson said. Coleman serves as partner of the investment firm he founded, Tiger Global Management. The hedge fund was an early investor in both Facebook and LinkedIn. On the Forbes 2019 list of the world's billionaires, he was ranked #458 with a net worth of US$4.5 billion. According to Business Insider, he was born into \\"old money\\" and has made a lot of \\"new money\\" as well. Political and economic views In 2012 Coleman donated US $30,800 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and US $5,000 to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. He has also donated to Democratic candidates, including $10,000 to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, $4,950 to Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and $2,700 to New York Senator Charles Schumer.

An elder sister of Motown founder Berry Gordy, she became a record executive in the mid-to-late 1950s distributing records released on Checker and Gone Records before forming the Anna label with Billy Davis and sister Gwen. Gordy later became known as a songwriter for several hits including the Originals' \\"Baby, I'm for Real\\", and at least two songs on Marvin Gaye's What's Going On album. The first wife of Gaye, their turbulent marriage later served as inspiration for Gaye's album, Here, My Dear. Biography =Life and career= Born Anna Ruby Gordy on January 28, 1922 in Oconee, Georgia, she was the third eldest of Berry Gordy Sr. (Berry Gordy II) and Bertha Ida (n√©e Fuller) Gordy's eight children. Into her first year, Gordy's family relocated to Detroit. Following graduation from high school in 1940, Gordy relocated to California, which is where Gordy's younger brother Berry moved to after he dropped out of high school to form a boxing career. Returning to Detroit in the mid-1950s, she and younger sister Gwen became operators of the photo concession at Detroit's Flame Show Bar. By the late 1950s, members of the Gordy clan were getting involved with the music business. In 1956, Anna began her career distributing records for Checker Records. In about 1957, she distributed a few recordings for Gone Records. In 1958, Anna and Gordy's younger sister Gwen founded the label Anna Records with musician Billy Davis, a year before Berry launched Tamla Records. Anna distributed Tamla's first national hit, Barrett Strong's \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\". Artists such as David Ruffin and Joe Tex also recorded for the label, and Marvin Gaye became a session musician with the company. After the label was absorbed as a subsidiary of Motown in 1961, Gordy joined Motown as a songwriter. Some of her early compositions were recorded by Gaye and Mary Wells. In 1965, Gordy co-wrote Stevie Wonder's \\"What Christmas Means to Me\\". Gordy later co-composed the Originals' hits \\"Baby, I'm for Real\\" and \\"The Bells\\" with Marvin Gaye. Gordy's name was included as a co-songwriter on two songs on Gaye's 1971 album, What's Going On, including \\"Flyin' High (In the Friendly Sky)\\" and \\"God Is Love\\". In 1973, Gordy's name was included in the credits to the song \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\", which was originally recorded in 1969 by the Monitors, and recorded by the Originals two years later. Gaye's version was overdubbed from the Originals recording and reversed the song's romantic lyrics for a more solemn view of the end of a marriage. Gordy left Motown at the end of the 1970s and retired from the music industry. =Personal life= Gordy met Marvin Gaye in 1959 when he was 20 years old and singing with Harvey and the New Moonglows. Gaye soon began working at Anna Records and soon developed an attraction to Ms. Gordy. They eventually began dating in 1960. After a three-year courtship, they married in June 1963. Inspired by their romance, Marvin penned hit singles about Anna including \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" and \\"Pride & Joy.\\" Of \\"Pride and Joy\\", Gaye said, \\"When I composed 'Pride and Joy', I was head over heels in love with Anna. I just wrote what I felt about her, and what she did for me. She was my pride and joy.\\" The marriage between Marvin and Anna was reportedly turbulent, including two public spats. In order to bring some stability to their home life, Anna and Marvin adopted a boy born on November 17, 1966, who was named after his adopted father (Marvin Pentz Gaye III). The boy was said to have been naturally conceived by Anna and Marvin in Motown's public relations stories of the couple, but Marvin confirmed his adoption in David Ritz's biography, Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye. In later years, the identity of the mother was revealed to be Denise Gordy, Anna's niece. In 1971, the couple moved to Hollywood. Two years later, they filed for legal separation. Gaye settled in with a young woman named Janis Hunter, with whom he had two children. In November 1975, Gordy filed for divorce. After nearly two years, the case was settled in Gordy's favor after Gaye agreed to remit a portion of his royalties from his next album to her. The resulting album, Here, My Dear, gave audiences a view of the marriage from Marvin's point of view. After its release in December 1978, Gordy threatened to sue Marvin for $5 million for the invasion of privacy. Nothing came of her threat. In the 1980s, Marvin and Anna reconciled as friends, and Anna accompanied Marvin to industry events following the release of his comeback album Midnight Love, in 1982. Anna attended the Grammy Awards in 1983, at which Marvin was awarded two trophies. Marvin's death in 1984 devastated Anna; later she and Marvin's three children scattered most of his ashes near the Pacific Ocean, while she kept a portion. When Marvin was honored with induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Anna and Marvin Gaye III accepted on his behalf. Gordy never remarried. Her last public appearance was in June 2008. She attended a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Heart Foundation event at which her brother Berry was honored. =Death= Gordy died on January 31, 2014, three days after her 92nd birthday. She is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park ‚Äì Hollywood Hills, Courts of Remembrance, Sanctuary of Enduring Protection.

They were conceived as mixed traffic locomotives, equally suitable for goods and passenger work, and had bar frames, narrow fireboxes, used saturated steam and had cylinders with overhead slide valves which were actuated by inside Stephenson valve gear. The Type WG bogie tender entered service with these engines. South African Railways When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (CGR, Natal Government Railways and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912. In 1912, these Consolidation types were designated Class 8X on the South African Railways (SAR).The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. Wheel arrangement modification In 1930, one of the Class 8X locomotives, SAR no. 883, was reboilered with a purpose-built boiler by SAR Chief Mechanical Engineer A.G. Watson. At the same time, it was equipped with superheating and piston-valve cylinders. The locomotive was converted to a Mastodon type wheel arrangement by replacing the leading pony truck with a bogie in a belated attempt to rectify one of the shortcomings of the original Class 8 locomotive. To accommodate the four- wheeled bogie, the front of the bar frame was apparently modified to reposition the cylinders. The modified no. 883 was reclassified and became the sole Class 8R locomotive. No other such conversions were done, since the Class 8 family had already begun to be displaced by newer and more powerful locomotives and many would be withdrawn from service by the late 1930s. Service Class 8R no. 883 was put to work in the Eastern Transvaal. Even though some did not consider the rebuilding a success, the engine remained in service for nine years until it was withdrawn from service in 1939. References 1590 1590 Category:H.M.

Her work has highlighted several important cultural changes in Sweden, including the growth of religious and cultural diversity in Sweden, as well as how modern, secular Swedes wrestle with those life questions that had previously been negotiated by religious authorities, such as death and dying. Lindman was born in Uppsala. She grew up in M√§rsta, Nyk√∂ping, and Ume√•. She has an academic background in religious studies and social anthropology and began working for SVT in 2001 as a news reporter and newsreader for Nordnytt. She became well known as the longstanding presenter for the series Existens (Existence), which lasted from 2003 to 2008. Other noteworthy programs of hers include Annas Eviga, which entailed conversations with specialists and celebrities on various eternal questions; Fr√•n Sverige till himlen (From Sweden to Heaven), in which Lindman profiled various religious groups in Sweden; and D√∂den, d√∂den, d√∂den (Death, Death, Death), about the questions surrounding human mortality. In August 2015, SVT began broadcasting her seven-part series Den enda sanna v√§gen (The Only True Way) about those groups labeled as cults. Related to this, she was the program leader, in November 2015, for an episode of the Uppdrag granskning examining the evangelical ministry Livets Ord and how it had allegedly defrauded many people of their money.

Its population was 335,048 at the 2015 census and it covers an area of . The island is located off the Ambazonian segment of Cameroon, in the Bight of Bonny portion of the Gulf of Guinea. Its geology is volcanic; its highest peak is Pico Basile at . Geography Bioko has a total area of . It is long from NNE to SSW and about across. It is volcanic and very mountainous with the highest peak Pico Basile (). It thus resembles neighbouring islands S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. Like them, it lies on the Cameroon line. Its southernmost point is called Punta Santiago. Bioko used to be the end of a peninsula attached to the mainland in what is now the Ambazonian region of Cameroon, but it was cut off when sea levels rose 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. Demographics The island has a population of 335,048 inhabitants (2015 Census). Its historic indigenous people are the Bubi people who currently constitute 58% of the population. Other ethnicities include the Fang at 16%, Fernandinos at 12%, and the Igbo at 7%, as well as African and European immigrants. Etymology Bioko's native name is √ãtul√° √ãria in the Bube language. Between 1973 and 1979 the island was named Mac√≠as Nguema Biyogo after the then president of Equatorial Guinea; the current name, Bioko, dates from 1979 and is in honour of politician Cristino Seriche Bioko. History The island was inhabited in the middle of the first millennium BC by Bantu tribes from the mainland, who formed the Bubi ethnic group. Unlike other islands in the area, Bioko had an indigenous African population. The Bubi speak a Bantu language. The island has probably been inhabited by this or other Bantu-speaking groups since before the 7th century BC. In 1472, the Portuguese navigator Fern√£o do P√≥ was the first European to sight the island. He named it Formosa Flora ('Beautiful Flower'). In 1494 it was renamed Fernando P√≥ in his honor after being claimed as a colony by the Portuguese. The Portuguese developed the island for sugarcane crops, and while considered poor quality, the refineries' output was such that Fernando Po sugar briefly dominated the trade centres in Europe. In 1642, the Dutch East India Company established trade bases on the island without Portuguese consent. It temporarily centralized from there its slave trade in the Gulf of Guinea. The Portuguese appeared again on the island in 1648, replacing the Dutch Company with one of their own, also dedicated to slave trading and established in its neighbour island Corisco. Parallel with this establishment, the Bubi clans began the slow process of establishing the core of a new kingdom on the island, especially after the activity of some local chiefs such as Molambo (approx. 1700‚Äì1760). During a period when enslavement was increasing in the region, local clans abandoned their coastal settlements and settled in the safer hinterland. Bioko in the distance from Limbe, Cameroon Under the 1778 Treaty of El Pardo, Portugal ceded Fernando Po, Annob√≥n, and the Guinea coast, R√≠o Muni, to Spain, together forming modern Equatorial Guinea. The treaty was signed by Queen Mary I of Portugal and King Charles III of Spain, in exchange for territory on the American continent. Spain mounted an expedition to Fernando Po, led by the Conde de Argelejos, who stayed for four months. In October 1778, Spain installed a governor on the island who stayed until 1780, when the Spanish mission left the island. Chief Molambo was succeeded by another local leader, Lorite (1760‚Äì1810), who was succeeded by Lopoa (1810‚Äì1842). After abolishing the British Atlantic slave trade, from 1827 to 1843 the British leased bases at Port Clarence (modern Malabo) and San Carlos for the African Slave Trade Patrol. The settlement at Port Clarence (named after the Duke of Clarence) was constructed under the supervision of William Fitzwilliam Owen. He had previously mapped most of the coasts of Africa and was a zealous anti-slaver. During his three-year command, his forces detained 20 ships and liberated 2,500 slaves. The Mixed Commission Court was moved from Freetown, Sierra Leone, to Clarence to hasten the legal process of emancipating slaves liberated from slave ships.Jordan Goodman, \\"The Hell-Borne Traffic\\" , Geographical, September 2007 In March 1843, Juan Jos√© Lerena planted the Spanish flag in Malabo, starting the decline of British influence on the island. Spain revoked the British lease in 1855. Madabita (1842‚Äì1860) and Sepoko (1860‚Äì1875) were principal local chiefs during the period when Spain re-established its control of the island. This period was also marked by Spain's transport deportation here of several hundred Afro-Cubans, as well as dozens of Spanish scholars and politicians considered politically undesirable. In addition Spain exiled 218 revolutionaries here from the Philippine Revolution, of whom only 94 survived for long.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons In 1923‚Äì1930, the League of Nations investigated the transportation of contract migrant labour between Liberia and the Spanish colony of Fernando Po. Although the League concentrated its attention on arrangements in Liberia, a closer examination revealed that labour abuse arose from conditions on Fernando Po. In the last quarter of the 19th century, Krio planters on the island had shifted from palm oil trading to cocoa cultivation. Their dependence on migrant labour and increasing competition with Europeans resulted in an economic crisis in the first years of the twentieth century. Planters detained labour but failed to pay their contracts, resulting in a situation of de facto slavery. Liberia prohibited labor traders from contracting with their citizens. During the Nigerian civil war in the 20th century, relief agencies used the island as a base for flights into Biafra. Languages The Bube language, with about 50,000 speakers, and various dialects, is the original language of the inhabitants of Bioko. However, given the numerous ethnic groups and peoples who operated on Bioko, a creole language developed, known as Pichi. It is based on English grammar, from the period when the British operated bases for their forces. It also incorporates West African languages from Nigeria and Liberia, as well as the Krio language that had developed in Sierra Leone. Workers came from all these areas in the 19th through much of the 20th century. Spanish has been an official language since 1844 when Spain took control of the island. It is still the language of education and administration, related to the more than 100 years as a Spanish colony. 67.6% of Equatoguineans can speak Spanish, especially those living in the capital, Malabo, on Bioko.Obiang convierte al portugu√©s en tercer idioma oficial para entrar en la Comunidad lus√≥fona de Naciones, Terra. 13 July 2007 Today Coastline of Bioko Malabo is the capital city of Equatorial Guinea.

The plant is operated by Marathon Oil Company through its subsidiary, Marathon Equatorial Guinea Production Limited (MEGPL). The plant produces natural gas liquids (NGL) including propane, butane, and condensate products. The majority of the residue gas from the Alba plant is delivered to a natural gas liquefaction plant operated by EG LNG. A portion of the Alba plant residue is also delivered to the Atlantic Methanol Production Company (AMPCO) and is used to produce methanol.

His first exhibit was just months after his release from Tranquil Shores, in the lobby of a movie theater, the historic Sun-Ray Cinema of Jacksonville, FL. Since then, thrashLife has exhibited around the country, including his first gallery showing with Ettra in Delray Beach, FL. In 2015, his participation in Instinct Gallery's \\"The Meds I'm On\\" exhibit generated positive reviews and press coverage. thrashLife's art is characterized by bright colors, \\"funny faces,\\" and ‚Äì as one journalist noted ‚Äì \\"phrases and at times, paragraphs, of honesty ... raw accounts of his every day life; be it good, bad, or ugly.\\" Visually, he's garnered comparisons to Jean-Michel Basquiat but the text written across his canvases more directly (and in great detail) addresses his issues with girls, love, sex, self-esteem, anxiety, and identity. In a biographical article for Folio Weekly, Janet Harper wrote, \\"Sam's openness with his art, and with perfect strangers, could be off- putting, the way he lets his guard down almost instantly and chats easily about the darkest parts of his life. He's open about his mental illness and drug addiction. About his issues with women and his need to be accepted and adored ... But Sam's brutal honesty, always with a dose of narcissism and boyish charm, makes it easy to be comfortable around him, and to trust him ... It's a rare trait, and one that leaves an impact on almost everyone he meets. He gives so much of himself, both through his art and the short biographical stories he includes with each piece ‚Äì which is exactly why it's selling.\\" \\"Have Sex With and/or Buy Art From Me\\" by Sammy thrashLife A review of a 2015 show in Minneapolis similarly noted, \\"While displays fill the gallery, the hectic work of artist Sammy thrashLife steals the show. When walking into the gallery, the first image you see straight ahead on the back wall is a jumbled mess of color captioned with a commanding \\"HAVE SEX WITH AND/OR BUY ART FROM ME.\\" After a light giggle from this order, you make your way to the piece and start reading the lighthearted fine print that lets you know that the aforementioned options are Sammy's only worth in this life. The dark, humorous piece, like many others he has on display, takes you on an introspective journey that leads you through Sammy's struggles with drugs, women, and depression‚Äîall of course presented with a special kind of dark humor that elicits simultaneous sadness and happiness. The piece features vibrant colors and characters that seem lifted from some darker, more anxious version of Adventure Time. All of Sammy's pieces in the show have this same laughable- but-sad style that creates a special kind of closeness between him and viewers. I wouldn't be surprised if I now know more about his life than some of his friends do.\\"  Music  thrashLife is responsible for Traffic Street Records, has played in a number of punk bands, has created art for other groups, and is an occasional contributor to Razorcake magazine, for whom he's interviewed Banner Pilot and Rational Anthem. Other notable interviews include Off with Their Heads for Punknews.org in 2007. Through his own website, he also occasionally publishes editorials and short articles on subjects relevant to the punk scene and in promotion of bands he supports. = Traffic Street Records = While in attendance at Georgetown University Law Center, thrashLife founded and operated an independent record label, Traffic Street Records.\\"Spacek's Label of the Year: Traffic Street Records, December 29, 2009 When his heroin addiction spun out of control post-graduation in the fall of 2011, a deal was struck with Kiss of Death Records to manage Traffic Street's catalog and fulfill all pending orders. In its active years, Traffic Street released recordings by Andrew Jackson Jihad, The Dopamines, The Brokedowns, The Measure, The Taxpayers, and many others. While thrashLife oversaw all elements of production at Traffic Street, he did not often create album covers himself. Artists responsible for Traffic Street album covers include Mitch Clem, Aldo Giorgini, and Lauren Denitzio. = Bands =  Extra Day For Riots  Sam North of Extra Day For Riots, during the band's set in Venice, FL in December 2003. As a teenager, thrashLife sang for Florida band, Extra Day For Riots. The band lasted from 2003 to 2005. In a 2013 interview, drummer Chris Hembrough, said of his time with the group: \\"Before Rational [Anthem], I played in a band called Extra Day For Riots in high school. My buddy, Sam North, who used to run Traffic Street Records, was the singer. We just played basic simple pop punk. Really jumpy blink-182-esque stuff. We won a talent show and did lots of drugs. The band broke up after we almost killed each other at band practice.\\" * The Most Fun I Ever Had CDEP (self-released, 2004) * Keeping '95 Alive CDEP (self-released, 2005)  Troublemake  After the demise of Extra Day For Riots, thrashLife formed Troublemake, a band consisting of himself as songwriter/singer/bassist and whichever friends he could gather up to record his songs or play shows. In contrast to Extra Day For Riots, Troublemake was warmly received by critics. Of the group's second EP, Feral, Jersey Beat wrote, \\"Sloppy lo-fi bedroom recordings never sounded so good before\\" and further praised \\"the socially fitting and heartfelt lyrics, sung with emotion and angst.\\" Razorcake's similarly enthusiastic review of the band's split EP with Turkish Techno described Troublemake as \\"a solid anathematic band, hailing from D.C., but making sounds in the Dillinger Four universe. This feels more produced than earlier songs‚Äîbut with the strong, eager oomph they've always had‚Äîdriving the songs with a spirit you can get on board with. This is the kind of stuff that makes house parties pop, getting everyone to sing and scream together.\\" Much more of a project than an active band, Troublemake's only activity was recording sporadically in the years 2005, 2006, and 2008, and several shows in support of Rational Anthem during that band's tour in the summer of 2008. * Staying Afloat in Florida CDEP (self-released, 2005) * Feral CDEP (self-released, 2007) * Turkish Techno / Troublemake 7-inch split (Traffic Street Records, 2009) * Dangerous Intersections V 7-inch compilation (Traffic Street Records, 2009; also featuring The Legendary San Diego Chargers, Shang-a-Lang, and Andrew Jackson Jihad) * Dirt Cult Mix Tape, Vol. II (Dirt Cult Records, 2009; also featuring Tenement, Vacation Bible School, Unwelcome Guests, and others).  Shitty Children  In the summer of 2014, thrashLife fronted a Chicago-based band called Shitty Children. The band performed in Chicago just once before being invited to play at the eighth annual Awesome Fest in San Diego, CA. In announcing their addition to the bill, festival organizer Marty Ploy wrote, \\"Super stoked on this! Sammy thrashLife has been a huge inspiration the last couple years and really is just rad as fuck. Come see his band with the dudes from Like Bats and ex-members of Rational Anthem.\\" While thrashLife, bassist Chris Spillane, and drummer were constant members of the band, Shitty Children had a different guitarist at each of the three shows they played before disbanding. No studio recordings were ever produced but a live video with lyrics was posted on thrashLife's website shortly after the band's first performance. = Design = In his later role as a visual artist, thrashLife has designed album art and merchandise for Todd Congelliere and Apocalypse Meow, Rational Anthem, Lipstick Homicide, Like Bats and others.  Personal life  thrashLife's father is musician Ian North of Milk 'N' Cookies, Neo, and Darkjet. In the summer of 2013, thrashLife auditioned for, and was cast in, the short film No Real Than You Are. The film premiered to a sold-out audience at the 2014 Sarasota Film Festival and found its first overseas audience at the Cannes Film Festival in France. On August 25, 2015, the state of Illinois charged thrashLife with criminal sexual assault. One week later, a blog entry appeared on thrashLife's website, stating: \\"I didn‚Äôt do this. The truth will come out.\\" At a preliminary hearing on September 15, a circuit court judge ruled there was no probable cause to believe thrashLife had committed any crime and the charges against him were dismissed.

In 1997, Banana was accused of being a homosexual, and after a highly publicised trial, was convicted of 11 counts of sodomy and \\"unnatural acts\\", serving six months in prison. Banana was born in Essexvale (today Esigodini), a village in Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia, to an Ndebele mother and a Mosotho father. He was educated at a mission school before studying at Epworth Theological College in Salisbury (today Harare). Ordained in 1962, he worked as a Methodist minister and a school administrator between 1963 and 1966. He was elected Chairman of the Bulawayo Council of Churches in 1969, holding that position until 1971. From 1971 to 1973, he worked for the All Africa Conference of Churches and was also a member of the Advisory Committee of the World Council of Churches. He became involved in anti-colonial politics, embracing black liberation theology and criticising the Rhodesian government under Ian Smith, which had declared the country independent under white- minority rule in 1965. He became Vice-President of the African National Congress, but soon was forced to flee Rhodesia. He first went to Japan, before moving to Washington, D.C., United States, where he studied at Wesley Theological Seminary. Upon returning to Rhodesia in 1975, he was imprisoned until 1976. That year, he accompanied Mugabe to the Geneva Conference, and in 1979, he attended the Lancaster House Conference in London that resulted in Zimbabwe's independence as a majority-rule democracy. In 1980, he became the country's first President, stepping down in 1987 so that Mugabe, who reformed the presidency from a ceremonial office into an executive one, could succeed him. Banana then worked as an Organisation of African Unity diplomat and also taught at the University of Zimbabwe. He also played a major role in arranging the union of the two main Zimbabwean revolutionary groups turned political parties, the ZAPU and his own ZANU, which merged in 1988 to form ZANU‚ÄìPF, which is still the country's ruling party. In 1997, Banana was arrested in Zimbabwe on charges of sodomy, following accusations made during the murder trial of his former bodyguard, who had killed another officer who had taunted him about being \\"Banana's homosexual wife\\". The charges related to allegations that Banana had misused his power while he was president to coerce numerous men into accepting sexual advances. Though he denied the accusations, he was found guilty of eleven charges of sodomy, attempted sodomy and indecent assault in 1998. He served six months in prison, and was also defrocked. He died of cancer in 2003, with sources varying on his place of death. Banana was a controversial figure, especially after his criminal conviction. As President, he did not always command respect (a law was passed in 1982, banning Zimbabweans from joking about his surname). Nevertheless, he was held in esteem by some for his involvement in Zimbabwe's liberation struggle and later for his role in uniting ZANU and ZAPU, which ended the Gukurahundi massacres. After his death, Mugabe called him a \\"rare gift to the nation.\\"Zimbabwe's first black president (67) dies, Irish Times, November 11, 2003 Early life and career Banana was born on 5 March 1936, near Essexvale (now Esigodini), Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia. His mother was an Ndebele, and his father was an ethnic Basotho who had emigrated from Lesotho. He attended the local Mzinyati mission school, before completing his secondary education at Tegwani High School in Plumtree. He later studied at a teacher training institute\\"Canaan Banana.\\" Biography Resource Center Online. Gale, 2004. before earning a diploma in theology at Epworth Theological College in Salisbury (today Harare). He was ordained a United Methodist minister in 1962. Between 1962 and 1966, he worked as a minister, visiting chaplain, and school administrator in Wankie (today Hwange) and Plumtree. In 1969, he was elected Chairman of the Bulawayo Council of Churches, an office he held until 1971. Between 1970 and 1973, he chaired the Southern Africa Content Group, part of the All Africa Conference of Churches' urban-industrial ministry. In that capacity, he worked with southern African churches as they adjusted to respond, theologically and practically, to urbanisation and industrialisation. During this time, he was also a member of the Advisory Committee of the World Council of Churches.  Political activity  In the 1960s and 1970s, Banana became active in anti-colonial politics. From the pulpit, began denouncing Rhodesia's white minority regime and preached a form of black liberation theology. He published a book entitled The Gospel According to the Ghetto, which included a personalised version of the Lord's Prayer that began \\"Our Father who art in the Ghetto.\\"Obituary: The Rev Canaan Banana, The Guardian, 12 November 2003 He embraced a socialist Christian theology, and declared that \\"when I see a guerilla, I see Jesus Christ\\". In 1971, the British government reached a deal with Rhodesian premier Ian Smith that provided for a transition to \\"majority rule\\" in exchange for an end to sanctions against Rhodesia. In response, Banana joined with fellow Methodist cleric Bishop Abel Muzorewa to form the United African National Council (UANC), which opposed the settlement. The proposed referendum was withdrawn and the UANC grew in prominence as a national political party. Initially, both Ndabaningi Sithole's Zimbabwe African National Union and Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union loosely aligned themselves with the UANC. Because both ZANU and ZAPU participated with guerrilla forces in the Rhodesian Bush War, the UANC was the only legal black political party in Rhodesia, since it rejected violence. Banana served as the Vice-President of the UANC from 1971 to 1973. Although Banana and the UANC were more moderate than ZANU or ZAPU, they still faced persecution from the government. When several other UANC leaders were arrested, he fled from Rhodesia with his wife and children. At first, he went to Botswana, where he briefly stayed with a minister friend, Ben Hopkinson. Next, he went to Japan, where he studied at Kansai University in Osaka. Finally, he moved to the United States, settling in Washington, D.C. from 1973 to 1975. There, he served as the UANC representative to the United States and the United Nations, and studied at Wesley Theological Seminary from 1974 to 1975, obtained a Master of Theology. Presidency of Zimbabwe When many Council members were arrested in the late 1960s, Banana and his family fled to the United States and did not return until 1975. Banana was arrested on his return but was released a year later, kept under house arrest, and then allowed to participate in Abel Muzorewa's plans for the country. However, he abandoned that effort and joined ZANU (led by Robert Mugabe), which was dedicated to overthrowing the Smith administration. Returning to Rhodesia in December 1976, Banana was arrested once more for his support of ZANU; upon the appointment of Lord Soames as Governor of Southern Rhodesia, he was released from prison. Under the country's new constitution, Banana became the first president in 1980. In 1982, a law was passed forbidding citizens from making jokes about his name. In 1987, his largely ceremonial post was taken over by Mugabe, who made himself executive president.Zimbabwe Moves to Limit Whites' Role : Legislation Prepared to End a Guarantee of Parliament Seats, Los Angeles Times, 24 June 1987 Banana then became a diplomat for the Organisation of African Unity and head of the religious department at the University of Zimbabwe. He played a large role in bringing the two major groups of independence fighters, ZANU and ZAPU, together to form the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front, a merger that took place in 1988. Sodomy charges and imprisonment In 1997, Banana was arrested in Zimbabwe on charges of sodomy, following accusations made during the murder trial of his former bodyguard, Jefta Dube. Dube, a policeman, had shot dead Patrick Mashiri,Essays in Honor of Bernth Lindfors, Volume 2, Barbara Harlow, Africa World Press, 2002, page 210 an officer who had taunted him about being \\"Banana's homosexual wife\\".Zim's presidential rape scandal, Mail and Guardian, 28 February 1997 The charges related to allegations from the state prosecutor that Banana had misused his power while he was president to coerce numerous men in positions of service (ranging from domestic staff to security guards, and even members of sports teams for whom he had acted as referee) into accepting sexual advances. Banana was found guilty of eleven charges of sodomy, attempted sodomy and indecent assault in 1998. He denied all charges, saying that homosexuality is \\"deviant, abominable and wrong\\", and the allegations made against him were \\"pathological lies\\" intended to destroy his political career. Janet Banana later discussed her husband's alleged homosexuality and confirmed it, even though she considered the charges against him to be politically motivated.Taylor, Rebecca. 'They say that power corrupts ‚Äì and it does'. The Guardian. 23 January 2002. He fled to South Africa whilst released on bail before he could be imprisoned, apparently believing Mugabe was planning his death. He returned to Zimbabwe in December 1998, after a meeting with Nelson Mandela, who convinced him to face the ruling. Banana was sentenced on 18 January 1999 to ten years in jail, nine years suspended, and was also defrocked. He actually served six months in an open prison before being released in January 2001. His wife sought political asylum in Britain in October 2000, under a pre-existing accord. His son Michael Thabo and Michael's wife Caroline Banana were the subject of a 2013 BBC documentary Britain on the Fiddle investigating welfare benefit fraud in the United Kingdom.

She has been described as \\"perhaps the ablest and most outstanding woman field botanist of her time\\".  Biography  Anna was born in November 1807 in Arnos Vale, Bristol, one of at least seven children born to Philip John Worsley, who was a sugar refiner. Her family were Unitarians and several of them had scientific interests; as a child they encouraged her in her interest in natural history. At first she studied entomology (the study of insects), but later she turned to plants. Anna's brother-in-law, Thomas Butler, who would later be the rector of a parish near Nottingham and the father of the novelist Samuel Butler, himself had a strong interest in botany and may have influenced Anna to pursue it as well. In 1835, the first volume of H. C. Watson's New Botanist's Guide was published, containing substantial contributions from Worsley, namely a list of flowering plants in the Bristol area. This brought greater attention to her work and in 1839 she published her Catalogue of Plants, found in the Neighbourhood of Newbury, which ran to thirty-one pages and included the first records in Berkshire of over sixty species. She soon joined the Botanical Society of London and actively contributed to its specimen exchanges. She also developed an interest in moss and fungi. Worsley married Frederick Russell in 1844. Russell was also a Unitarian and a botanist; they had been friends for several years, with Russell accompanying Worsley on plant gathering expeditions and collecting some specimens for her. At first they lived in Brislington, near Bristol, but in 1856 they moved to Kenilworth, Warwickshire. She studied the fungi in the local area, publishing a paper in the Journal of Botany on rare local species and preparing more than seven hundred and thirty drawings. Anna Russell died in Kenilworth on 11 November 1876. Her husband had died before her and she had no children. She left her drawings to the British Museum (Natural History), where they are still kept, and her herbarium and collection of birds' eggs to the Birmingham and Midland Institute.

Domain validated certificates were first distributed by GeoTrust in 2002 before becoming a widely accepted method.  Issuing criteria  The sole criterion for a domain validated certificate is proof of control over whois records, DNS records file, email or web hosting account of a domain. Typically control over a domain is determined using one of the following: * Response to email sent to the email contact in the domain's whois details * Response to email sent to a well-known administrative contact in the domain, e.g. (admin@, postmaster@, etc.) * Publishing a DNS TXT record * Publishing a nonce provided by an automated certificate issuing system A domain validated certificate is distinct from an Extended Validation Certificate in that this is the only requirement for issuing the certificate. In particular, domain validated certificates do not assure that any particular legal entity is connected to the certificate, even if the domain name may imply a particular legal entity controls the domain.  User interface  Most web browsers may show a lock (often in grey, rather than the green lock typically used for an Extended Validation Certificate) and a DNS domain name. A legal entity is never displayed, as domain validated certificates do not include a legal entity in their subject. *Mozilla Firefox historically showed domain validated certificates with a grey lock, but this was modified to show a green lock for domain-validated connections after Mozilla launched Let's Encrypt (which only provides domain validated certificates). *Safari shows domain validated certificates with a grey lock. *Microsoft Edge displays domain validated certificates with a hollow grey lock. *Chrome and Chromium display a green lock.  Characteristics  As the low assurance requirements allow domain validated certificates to be issued quickly without requiring human intervention, domain validated certificates have a number of unique characteristics: * Domain validated certificates are used in automated X.509 certificate issuing systems, such as Let's Encrypt. * Domain validated certificates are often cheap or free. * Domain validated certificates can be generated and validated without any documentation. * Most domain validated certificates can be issued instantly.

The sole member of the commission was Nial Fennelly, a retired justice of the Supreme Court. Fennelly identified three separate strands within the commission's terms of reference: # Garda phone recordings scandal: unauthorised recordings made since the 1980s of conversations to and from some Garda stations (other than 999 emergency telephone number calls, recorded as a matter of course). # Death of Sophie Toscan du Plantier: evidence from phone recordings at Bandon Garda station of misconduct in the investigation # Martin Callinan: circumstances of his retirement as Garda Commissioner in March 2014. Interim report: Callinan  In November 2014, the Government requested Fennelly to investigate the Martin Callinan issue first and issue an interim report on it before dealing with the other two issues. Callinan's leaving office was described at the time, by himself and the government, as a decision to retire; however it was described by the media as a resignation, and the opposition accused Taoiseach Enda Kenny of having effectively sacked Callinan. The requested interim report was issued in September 2015. Kenny asserted that it vindicated his view of the events, but Fianna F√°il and Sinn F√©in claimed the opposite and promised to raise motions of no confidence in the Taoiseach when D√°il √âireann resumed after the summer recess. Final report The final report was submitted on 31 March 2017 and published on 6 April.Final Report, p.3 The report found that senior garda√≠ had \\"almost total ignorance\\" of the fact that phone calls were being recorded.Final Report, ¬ß7.40, p.55 It found no evidence that recordings were being used \\"improperly or unlawfully\\", while noting that the mere fact of being recorded was itself illegal, and that absence of evidence is not proof of non-existence. The commission did not address one term of reference, namely allegations of recording phone conversations between solicitors and prisoners (in the custody of the Irish Prison Service rather than the Garda S√≠och√°na). This was because the commission required an initial report from the Inspector of Prisons, Michael Reilly, incomplete at his death in November 2016.Final Report, ¬ß1.3, p.23 The report noted that Garda√≠ investigating the Toscan du Plantier murder had discussed the possibility of altering or suppressing evidence,Final Report, pp.97‚Äì99 but not that they had actually done so.

The dance is part of the repertoire of nearly every professional Bulgarian folk troupe. The Petrunino horo is one of the two main examples of Bulgarian dances in 12/16 meter.Barber E. W.

Meter  Petrunino horo is commonly played and danced in a 12/16 meter. The meter is similar to that of the Eleno Mome tune in that the major groupings are counted as slow, slow, quick, medium. The main difference between Petrunino horo and Eleno Mome is that in Petrunino horo, the second slow is divided into two, yielding a slow, quick, quick, quick, medium. This rhythm is used in almost every measure of most versions of the dance.Antokoletz A. E. et al. (ed.)Bartok Perspectives : Man, Composer, and Ethnomusicologist.

Basketball player LeBron James is one of the original investors in the chain, which is touted by Bloomberg \\"as the next Chipotle\\".  Concept  Blaze Pizza's name was derived from how quickly a create-your-own pizza can be \\"Fast Fire'd\\" in a high-temperature open-flame oven ‚Äì an average cook time is 3 minutes. Customers begin by choosing which of the ingredients they‚Äôd like on their pizza. As customers work their way down the service line, staff assemble a pizza based on customer instructions. When they arrive at the end of the line, their custom-built pizza is ready to be cooked. The Blaze ovens are \\"-wide gas-fired () unit operated at average temperatures of to \\" according to the company's executive chef. Since the high-temperature gas-fired pizza oven is the only piece of cooking equipment inside each of the restaurants, the same oven is also used to roast the chicken, cook the Italian sausage and meatballs, and bake some of the desserts.  History  Blaze Pizza was founded in Pasadena, California, by Rick and Elise Wetzel in 2011. The fast-fired, customizable pizza concept debuted with their first location in Irvine, California, in August 2012, which was followed two months later by the opening of their second, and flagship, location in October 2012 in Pasadena. During the first year of operation, the Irvine location grossed about $1.8 million and the Pasadena location grossed about $2.5 million. = Growth plan = By the end of 2014, Blaze had become the first fast-casual pizza restaurant to achieve 50 opened units. At that time, the company had commitments with franchise partners to open 343 restaurants in 39 states. The chain had grown to $33 million in sales and $1.55 AUV in 2014. On pace to open an average of one new store every five days, the company planned to have at least 500 locations by 2020. An initial public offering might be possible within two or three years after 2015. International =Canada= In August 2015, the company announced plans to open its first location outside the U.S., in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The creek is about long. Geography The creek begins in a marshy area at Apulia Station, near State Route 80, as the confluence of a few seasonal streams that drain the nearby Truxton, Jones and Fellows Hills. It flows north through a glacial valley into Jamesville Reservoir. Below Jamesville Reservoir it is joined by Rush Creek, flows through the village of Jamesville, past Clark Reservation State Park, and then under Interstate 481. The creek intersects the old Erie Canal at the Cedar Bay near DeWitt where it is also joined by Meadow Brook. The creek then flows past the CSX DeWitt rail yards and Interstate 90, turns east, and flows into Limestone Creek near Minoa. The Butternut Creek watershed encompasses approximately . There are of mapped streams within the watershed. Water quality in the Jamesville reach and above is considered good. However, the lower reaches of the creek are moderately affected by high nutrient levels from agriculture and urban runoff. The 100-year flood flow at Interstate 90 bridge is estimated at . Geology The topography of the Butternut Creek watershed was sculpted by glaciers during the last Ice Age, During the glacial maximum, about 20,000 years ago, the whole area was covered by a thick ice sheet. As the ice retreated about 12,000 years ago during the Pleistocene, Glacial Lake Newbury was formed to the west, in the present-day Syracuse area. The lake was initially dammed on its east end by the hills between the Butternut and Onondaga Creek valleys. As meltwater filled the lake, it overflowed this ridge, turning what is now lower Butternut Creek into a large river, eventually connecting to the Mohawk‚ÄìHudson River river system. After the ice fully melted, the water drained northward into the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River, leaving the now dry \\"Syracuse channels\\" ‚Äì a series of large breaks between the Butternut and Onondaga valleys ‚Äì and a 180 foot escarpment at Clark Reservation State Park, which was once a giant waterfall fed by glacier melt. Near Jamesville, the Butternut Creek valley has carved through the limestone Onondaga Escarpment, part of the 550-million-year-old Onondaga Formation, creating a steep and narrow gorge. The Jamesville Quarry is situated along the creek and has excavated about of the area. History Butternut Creek above Jamesville Reservoir The Butternut Creek valley was centrally located in the traditional lands of the Onondaga people. In 1681, Father Jean de Lamberville wrote that the main Onondaga village was situated along the east bank of the creek about a mile south of present day Jamesville, in the valley now flooded by Jamesville Reservoir. After clashes with French colonists in the early 1700s the Onondaga moved south into the hill country along upper Butternut Creek, before being forced west to the Onondaga Creek during the 1720s. According to the Geographic Names Information System, known Native American names for the creek include Ka-soongk-ta, Kashunkta, Ki-ech-i- o-i-ah-te, and Oh-jees-twa-ya-na. In 1856, the first Butternut Creek Aqueduct was built to carry the Erie Canal across the creek. The original wooden structure has since been replaced by a three-span stone and concrete bridge, with a span of . Old Erie Canal, DeWitt, NY Jamesville Reservoir was originally constructed in 1874 to provide water for the Erie Canal during dry seasons. The reservoir has of water, a capacity of , and is bordered by Jamesville Beach County Park, a popular local swimming area. During the 1970s, the Jamesville Dam was found to have cracked from age and the reservoir was temporarily drained while repairs were carried out. During the floods of 1974 the creek crested at a record , causing flooding in portions of DeWitt. Several portions of the creek were channelized during the construction of Interstate 481 in the 1970s, to provide flood control and reduce erosion. In 2012 the Butternut Creek aqueduct breached, draining a large part of the Erie Canal and causing flash flooding in Butternut Creek. The aqueduct was repaired by plugging the breach with gravel. Recreation The creek is stocked annually with 7,600 brown trout and 600 brook trout from the Carpenter's Brook Fish Hatchery. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation maintains of the creek for public fishing. There is also a population of wild brook trout. The Butternut Creek Recreation Area, a municipal park of the Town of DeWitt, is located adjacent to the creek in the vicinity of I-481 and Kinne Road, and consists of a hiking/ biking trail along the creek as well as boardwalk trails in nearby marshes. The trail connects with the New York State Canalway Trail at Ryder Park and Recreation Area, on the old Erie Canal. There is a proposal to add a canoe launch and fishing dock on Butternut Creek.

Through Executive Order 224 issued by President Fidel V. Ramos on February 10, 1995 transferring the management, administration, and maintenance responsibilities from the PTA to the Baguio City Government.

The deal between the investors and the city government was reached on December 10, 2009 and was later approved by the city council on December 11 of the same year. The property would have been leased for 25 years with a monthly lease of P100,000 per month, with a 10 percent increased after five years. The plan involved building a hotel, a driving range, and a bus terminal. The planned development was a subject of controversy among Baguio residents. On January 8, 2010, Baguio City Mayor Reinaldo Bautista, Jr. said that the plan is not yet final and is still a proposal. The proposal was later scrapped by the city government. =2014-2016 renovations= In 2012, Mayor Mauricio Domogan announced new plans to development of the Baguio Athletic Bowl and Burnham Park. The plan generated concerns with Councilor Edison Bilog calling Baguio residents to remain vigilant against commercialization of the park and cutting of trees for the development particular those at the World Park at the back of the Athletic Bowl. Domogan responded that the trees mentioned by Bilog will not be affected by the development and that he has sent the terms of reference of the project to the city council. At least three phases of renovation work are planned for the Athletic Bowl. Phase 1 involved the construction of a multipurpose office, a grandstand and the 75 percent completion of the venue's bleachers. The bleachers were installed by Department of Public Works and Highways- Cordillera. Phase 1 was completed in January 2015 and Phase 2 of the renovation work started. Phase 2 was suspended in early February 2015 due to Baguio's hosting of the 2015 Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association Meet and the annual Panagbenga Festival celebrations. Phase 2 resumed after the conclusion of Panagbenga celebrations in March. Phase 2, was planned to be completed by February 2016, in time for the 2016 Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association (Caraa) meet which involved the installing of rubber tracks from Switzerland, continuation of unfinished bleachers and repair of the venue's old drainage system. Spurway Enterprises and R.U.

Togashi Masachika, who ruled Kaga Province as shugo, had been restored to power in 1473 with aid from the Asakura clan as well as the Ikk≈ç- ikki, a loose collection of lesser nobility, monks, and farmers. By 1474, however, the Ikk≈ç-ikki grew discontent with Masachika, and launched some initial revolts, which were easily quelled. In 1487, when Masachika left on a military campaign, between 100,000 and 200,000 Ikk≈ç-ikki revolted. Masachika returned with his army, but the Ikk≈ç-ikki, backed by several disaffected vassal families, overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace, where he committed seppuku. The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of shugo to Masachika's uncle Yasutaka, but over the next several decades, the Ikk≈ç-ikki increased their political hold on the province, which they would effectively control for almost a century. Background and initial revolts During the 15th century in Japan, peasant revolts, known as ikki, became much more commonplace. During the turmoil of the ≈ånin War (1467‚Äì1477) and subsequent years, these rebellions increased in both frequency and success. Many of these rebels became known as Ikk≈ç-ikki, a collection of peasant farmers, Buddhist monks, Shinto priests, and jizamurai (lesser nobles) who all espoused belief in the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ sect of Buddhism. Rennyo, the Hongan-ji abbot who led the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ movement, attracted a large following in Kaga and Echizen Province, but distanced himself from the political goals of the ikki, advocating violence only for self-defense or defense of one's religion. During the mid-15th century, a civil war broke out among the Togashi clan over the position of shugo. Togashi Masachika had been driven out of Kaga by his younger brother, Kochiyo. When the ≈ånin War broke out in 1467, Masachika sided with Hosokawa and Kochiyo with Yamana. In 1473, Masachika requested aid from Asakura Toshikaga, the lord of Echizen and ally of Hosokawa, as well as from the priests of Yoshizaki, who were associated with Rennyo. Masachika promised the ikki that if restored to power, he would lift his supporters out of their poverty. Further motivating the ikki to support Masachika were the religious policies of Kochiyo: Kochiyo patronized the Takada school of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´, a fierce rival to the Hongan-ji for control of the Shinsh≈´ sect, and persecuted followers of the Hongan-ji. Toshikaga pledged his support, as did the Yoshizaki priests, the latter prior to any approval from Rennyo. Rennyo eventually granted his approval to the actions of the Yoshizaki priests, and with Toshikaga providing military aid and the Ikk≈ç-ikki rioting throughout Kaga, Masachika quickly overthrew his brother. But Ikk≈ç-ikki support of Masachika was short-lived. By 1474, the Ikk≈ç-ikki were in dispute with Masachika as they claimed that he did not fulfill his promises of economic reward, and they attempted a rebellion. Rennyo refused to support their actions and the rebels were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in Etch≈´ Province. In 1475, Shimotsuma Rensu, a disciple of Rennyo, falsely claimed that Rennyo supported a renewed uprising in Kaga. The revolt failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu. Tiring of his efforts to restrain the unruly Ikk≈ç-ikki, Rennyo left Yoshizaki for the capital region. 1488 revolt Despite the previous revolts having been easily suppressed, unrest continued to simmer in Kaga under Masachika's governance. The Ikk≈ç-ikki who remained in Kaga grew bolder, refusing to pay taxes and even seizing tax revenue and land, despite Rennyo's continued protestations. In 1487, Masachika left with a large army for ≈åmi Province in response to a call for aid from sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshihisa, who was attempting to suppress the robber baron Rokkaku Tokoyori. In Masachika's absence, the Ikk≈ç-ikki, led by Rengo, Renk≈ç, and Rensei, three sons of Rennyo, launched their revolt and between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand members took up arms. Masachika quickly returned from his military expedition, and defeated the rebels in several battles. However, several vassal families, discontent with Masachika, joined with the rebels. The rebels cut off Masachika from reinforcements from his allies in the bordering Echizen, Etch≈´, and Noto Provinces, and besieged his castle. Masachika, trapped in a burning castle and faced with certain defeat, committed seppuku. In his place, the vassal families who rebelled against Masachika put forward his uncle and ex-shugo, Yasutaka, as a candidate to be the new shugo. Aftermath Following the overthrow of Masachika, Kaga became known as \\"hyakusho no motaru kuni\\" (\\"the kingdom of peasants\\", or \\"province ruled by peasants\\"). Sh≈çgun Yoshihisa, a friend and ally of Masachika, demanded that Rennyo excommunicate the Kaga ikki. However, Hosokawa Masamoto, an influential political figure who was also a close friend and patron of Rennyo, negotiated a deal which permitted Rennyo to merely reprimand the ikki while Masamoto would join the Hongan-ji. In Kaga, Togashi Yasutaka took power as shugo, ruling the province until his death in 1504. Afterward, under the rule of his son, Taneyasu, the ikki began to assert their influence over the vassal families that supported them in the uprising. The ikki soon split into rival political factions and initiated a series of political struggles which culminated in a civil war in 1531. The heads of the three predominant Hongan- ji temples in Kaga, as well as Taneyasu, were defeated when Renjun, a son of Rennyo, brought in Ikk≈ç-ikki troops from Mikawa Province. Upon Renjun's victory, the office of shugo was abolished and the leaders of the opposition were exiled. The Ikk≈ç-ikki would control Kaga until 1580, when forces loyal to Oda Nobunaga defeated them.

Soon after the regiment arrived in that section, he began to develop qualities which attracted the attention first of Col. George Leonard Andrews, his regimental Commander, and finally of General George B. McClellan himself. The latter then issued orders that \\"Jack\\" should be allowed to pass through the Federal lines, day or night, whenever he wished. He used the privilege to good advantage several times, saving the Union troops from disastrous surprises. As a successful scout did he become so annoying and so well known to the rebels that Confederate Col. Henry Marshall Ashby offered $500 for his scalp. Jack, being anxious to see the male who was so anxious to get hold of his top knot, started out toward Petersburg, then held by the rebels, arriving at the house of a Union farmer by which Ashby was expected soon to pass. He borrowed a suit of clothiers, a horse, and a scythe from the farmer and started up the road to meet said Ashby. The latter came in sight, and Jack, with the scythe swung over his shoulder, stopped him and had a protracted conversation with him. Several times during the interview Jack was tempted to shoot Ashby with his revolver, but he suffered him to depart in peace. Jack learned, during the conversation, that two companies of Ashby's cavalry would soon pass along a certain road, and he collected a party of Union farmers, ambushed them, and killed eleven men and two horses. When the Fourth Regiment was transferred to Shield's division and the division transferred to Banks' department, Jack went with it, of course. He soon won the confidence of his new departmental commander and was again employed in collecting information of the movements of the enemy. The last time he was sent out by Gen. Banks, he was accompanied by Richard Field, also of Marion, and as brave as Jack himself. They were ordered to procure information of the situation of Gen. Ewell's camp. They proceeded to a point on the Masanatten Mountain whence they could, by the aid of a splendid field-glass belonging to Col. Godman, obtain a full view of the rebel encampment. After making a thorough sketch of it, they started for headquarters, Jack having his papers in his cap with his handkerchief over them. On their way, they were suddenly surrounded by a number of Mississippi soldiers. The officer in command ordered them to surrender, which they did, but when ordered to advance, Jack stopped, took off his cap, took out the handkerchief, gathering the papers in his hand with it, wiped his face, threw the handkerchief back deftly retaining the papers in his band, and, whilst advancing toward the officer, apparently by accident he stubbed his toe, fell down and ran his hand under the leaves and rubbish, leaving the papers there, and thus saving himself and comrade from being shot as spies. They were then taken to Richmond, treated most inhumanly for eight or nine days, and finally paroled.History of Marion County, Ohio, p. 456, Leggett, Conaway, & Co., Chicago, 1883.

Reception In a review for Down Beat, John Corbett points the BYG LPs that Blackwell recorded with Don Cherry as the main reference and states \\"Smith is much too strong an individualist to play anyone else's role, and while he has a definite multicultural orientation and clearly loves the raw sonic potential of the trumpet, you've never mistake him for Cherry.

Down Beat March 11: page 54. Print. The All About Jazz review by Clifford Allen notes that \\"Smith's sense of orchestration has always seemed entirely different from Cherry's, whether in a solo or group context. The phrasing of both sound and silence, ever natural, has always appeared utterly poised, pinched and cutting front-porch paeans to downriver ancestry wrapped into a massive, fluffed whole. But it would be difficult to look at this set of duos without thinking of Mu, even when conscious of the contrast between the pairings.\\"Allen, Clifford.

Boynukalƒ±n became an AKP parliamentary candidate from ƒ∞stanbul's 3rd electoral district and was elected at the June 2015 general election. =Raid on H√ºrriyet headquarters= On the evening of September 6, 2015, about 200 AKP supporters attacked the headquarters of the Doƒüan Media Center, where the headquarters of the H√ºrriyet newspaper is located. Mob threw stones at the beginning of the building's windows, and the former President of Turkey, AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the news about the Freedom of expression had Boynukalƒ±n. After 16 Turkish soldiers were killed by Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants in Daƒülƒ±ca, Erdoƒüan was heavily criticized, claiming that the attack would never have happened if the AKP had won 400 seats in the June 2015 general elections. However, H√ºrriyet newspaper later made an apology for the news. Boynukalin stated in the statement he made at that time that the protests had a democratic basis and that they had exceeded their purpose and apologized to the Hurriyet newspaper and argued that the reactions should be made on a democratic basis. In the news written in that period, It also emerged that he was a critic of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk and had previously authored tweets in support for Abdullah √ñcalan, the imprisoned leader of the PKK, on his Twitter account. After the attack, H√ºrriyet took Boynukalƒ±n to court for vandalism, threatening individuals in order to create panic and fear, breaking and entering, inciting others to commit a crime and attempting to limit freedoms. However, the prosecutor's office decided that there was no need to prosecute Boynukalƒ±n.

She works on long term photo-based projects seeking to interrogate dominant historical narratives and imagine alternatives to them. Her work explores community and the interactions within it, as well as the barriers and connections between people, between places and between ways of perceiving. her practice has embraced collaboration, and through this, collage, drawing, sewing, text, and found images have been integrated into her work. She is interested in collapsing the traditional divide between author and subject, the real and the imaginary, challenging entrenched binaries. Drake was born in California and studied Media/Culture and History in the early 1990s at Brown University. Her extensive work among people in Central Asia, and Xinjiang in China, is presented in two well received self-published books, Two Rivers and Wild Pigeon. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art presented a solo exhibition of the latter and acquired the collection of original works from the project in 2018. Drake is a member of Magnum Photos. She has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship,Carolyn Drake, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Retrieved 7 September 2015. the Lange-Taylor Prize, the Anamorphosis photo book prize, a Fulbright fellowship, and a World Press Photo award. Her work is also held in the collection of the U.S. Library of Congress. Life and work Drake was born in California. She had a \\"multimedia job in New York's Silicon Alley\\" until starting as a photographer at the age of 30. In 2006 she moved to Ukraine and in 2007 to Istanbul, Turkey, until 2013. Whilst based in Istanbul she made two long term projects, one in the central Asian countries that were part of the Soviet Union, Two Rivers, and one on the Chinese side of central Asia, Wild Pigeon. Partly funded by a Guggenheim Fellowship, Drake made fifteen journeys over five years travelling and photographing in the once vibrant region of central Asia that lies between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers that once nourished it. The region, encompassing Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, was transformed when the rivers were diverted for cotton irrigation by the former Soviet Union. Drake's resulting self-published book, Two Rivers (2013), was financed via Kickstarter; it was well received by Sean O'Hagan. For Jeffrey Ladd, the book's design (by Sybren Kuiper), notably the way some photographs on recto pages have their right edges on the verso, detracted from it. She spent seven years visiting Xinjiang in western China (officially called Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region), photographing the Uyghur people for her self-published book Wild Pigeon (2014). There is discord between the Chinese authorities and the indigenous ethnic Uyghur population. Wild Pigeon was well received, again by Sean O'Hagan, who wrote that \\"Drake is a master of atmosphere\\"; and by Martin Parr; Colin Pantall; Blake Andrews; and Ian Denis Johnson, who wrote \\"this book does what a great social novel does: it forces us to think of a contested region not in terms of op-eds or political analyses, but as seen by people in daily life\\". For Jeffrey Ladd, the design of the book (again by Sybren Kuiper) avoided the excesses of that of Two Rivers, and \\"The results of the collages [by the people Drake photographed] are unexpectedly rich and create the sense of a place that is both [ordinary] with daily routine and imbued with the fantastic that is accented by Drake‚Äôs own perceptions: young teenagers dance under a burst of colored light; a classroom that seems to take on surreal drama; a dog fight; skeletal remains hanging in a butcher shop.\\" In 2013 Drake and her partner, photographer Andres Gonzalez, moved from Istanbul to the United States to begin a new body of work, and moved to Water Valley, Mississippi, then in 2015 to Athens, Georgia, and finally to Vallejo, California in 2016. In 2015 she became a nominee member of Magnum Photos, in 2017 an associate member., and in 2019 a full member. Publications =Publications by Drake= *Two Rivers. Self-published, 2013. .

The album was Jones' fourth studio LP release, after his marginally successful debut album the previous year. The album didn't chart well; however, it plays many of his best early recordings. The LP was released in May 1957 when Starday Records was being absorbed by Mercury Records in 1957. It lists his first 6 Top 10 Country charters, including a collaboration with Jennette Hicks, and a rerecording of his very first recording from August 1956. Background 14 Top Country Song Favorites was compiled from multiple recording sessions throughout 1955‚Äì1957. It also included songs that were previously listed on his earlier debut album. It includes Jones' very first charting track, \\"Why Baby Why\\" and a popular hit of Jones' from 1956 titled: \\"You Gotta Be My Baby.\\" The album was produced by Jones' manager, and Starday Records co-founder, Pappy Daily, during a realignment of the top management jobs in Nashville, which would later result in the absorption of Starday to Mercury. During the exchange, multiple releases were made, and the label would print them as a Mercury-Starday printing. Recording and composition George Jones made his very first recording on January 19, 1954, with \\"No Money in This Deal.\\" This album's version was a rerecording made in August 1956. The first track was a #13 hit titled \\"Too Much Water\\" which Jones recorded on March 19, 1957, which was his very first session of Jones' held in Nashville. He later performed the song live on \\"The Tex Ritter Show.\\" \\"Why Baby Why\\" was recorded on August 27, 1955 and soon after release in September. The song became Jones' first charting single. It would peak at #4 and remain his highest charting single until the next year, when \\"Just One More,\\" which would peak at #2 after release in September 1956. The song became one of Jones' greatest early hits, being covered by multiple artists since. \\"You Never Thought\\" was recorded in April 1957 and is the last track on the album to be recorded (ca. April 1957). \\"Take the Devil Out Of Me\\" was recorded in January 1957 alongside \\"Cup of Loneliness,\\" which became his most well known gospel recording during the 1950s. \\"Ragged But Right\\" is one Jones' best known songs. Although it didn't chart, the song would become a live favorite and Jones would rerecorded it multiple times. This album's version of the song was his first rerecording of the track, from August 1956. \\"All I Want to Do\\" was recorded in October 1956, and would later become the B-side to \\"Too Much Water\\" in April 1957. Also in April 1957, the song \\"You Never Thought\\" was cut. Another song that appeared as a B-side to another track listed in this album was \\"Gonna Come Get You,\\" released with \\"Just One More\\" in late 1956. Also during late 1956, one of Jones' biggest songs became \\"You Gotta Be My Baby,\\" which Jones would perform live very often during the 1950s (including at his Grand Ole Opry debut in 1957). It peaked at #7 soon after release in late June, 1956. \\"Uh, Uh, No\\" was the B-side to \\"Don't Stop the Music,\\" recorded in October 1956, and released in January 1957. ;Yearning (To Kiss You) Jones would achieve great success recording duets with Tammy Wynette, but before this Jones recorded with Melba Montgomery and Margie Singleton in the early-mid 1960s. He collaborated with three different artists in the 1950s: Sonny Burns in 1954, Jennette Hicks in 1956, and Virginia Spurlock in 1957. In August 1956, he collaborated with his second artist, Jennette Hicks. With her, Jones would record three songs, including his first charting collaboration single. Jones and Hick's song, \\"Yearning,\\" peaked at #10 on the US Country chart. Track listing Jones would write or co-write all 14 tracks on this LP release.

Facilities The bunker was built in secret and was camouflaged to look like a flight weather station. It consisted of a three-story deep stainless steel and concrete bunker system that rested on shock absorbers, comprising 7,500 square meters on three levels underground, each 63x40 meters, with 3 meter-thick walls and 7 meter-thick ceilings. It was designed to enable the East German army to operate from there after a nuclear war, with up to 455 men able to survive for up to a month. The bunker included command and control facilities for operations personnel, meeting rooms, rooms for ministers, a canteen, kitchen, sleeping rooms, medical center. It also featured the systems and technology needed for survival in an isolated bunker surrounded by destruction, including water supplies, electricity generation, air cleaning and circulation system, climate regulation and waste treatment systems. The building was not detected by NATO Intelligence and was first revealed to the public in 1990, on the day of German reunification. Museum The bunker is today protected as a national monument and is open for tours by appointment.

He is signed to Tri Angle Records and to Kanye West‚Äôs publishing house, DONDA. He released his debut mixtape Kings and Them in 2012 and gained prominence as a collaborator on West's 2013 album Yeezus. He released a further EP on Tri Angle, Waterfall, in 2014. In August 2015 he pulled out of Reading Festival after claiming to have been detained by security staff at the Leeds sister festival.  Life and career  Leary grew up in the small town of Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool. He began making music after playing around with vintage keyboards belonging to his father, who initially made Kraftwerk-influenced synth music before becoming a trance DJ in the late ‚Äô90s. At 19 he produced a selection of J. Dilla-influenced soul edits, and intended to release them until the label he had partnered with went out of business. While training to be a primary school teacher at Edge Hill University, Leary produced the eight tracks that would make up his debut mixtape, Kings And Them. Made music in his garage on Cubase. In December 2011, he posted three of the tracks on YouTube under the name Evian Christ, apparently only for his friends to hear. They were discovered by Dummy Magazine and other music blogs, which led to a search for his identity. After the tracks blew up, Leary responded to a message from Tri Angle Records founder Robin Carolan, who signed him to the label. In February 2012, Tri Angle released Kings And Them, a free mixtape compiling his musical output thus far. Days after, Leary made his live debut at a Tri Angle showcase in London alongside Balam Acab, Romy xx, and The Haxan Cloak. Directly after graduating from his education program, Leary left the UK to tour in America. In July 2012, Tri Angle rereleased Kings And Them as a limited edition 12\\" EP featuring remastered versions of mixtape tracks \\"Fuck It None Of Y‚ÄôAll Don‚Äôt Rap,\\" \\"Thrown Like Jacks,\\" \\"Drip,\\" and \\"MYD.\\" In 2013, Kanye West reached out to Leary to produce material for his then-upcoming record Yeezus. West flew him out to Paris, where he worked with in-house engineers and producers to create the album track \\"I‚Äôm In It.\\" By the end of the year, West signed Evian Christ to his publishing house, DONDA. In the same year, Leary attended the Red Bull Music Academy in New York City. Leary released his debut EP, Waterfall, in March 2014. He also announced work for the follow-up to Yeezus, and hosted Trance Parties in the UK. In 2015, collaborated with artist David Rudnick to create a temporary art installation at London's ICA, and expanded his Trance Parties, with the fourth edition taking place in Liverpool, London and Sheffield. In August 2016, Leary produced \\"Pneumonia,\\" the second single from rapper Danny Brown's critically acclaimed fourth studio album, Atrocity Exhibition. The single was officially released on August 19 through Warp Records.  Style and influences  He was always inspired by his dad's trance DJing and then went on to discover R&B; and hip-hop through MTV Base. Later, he stumbled upon experimental electronica and ambient music through Grouper, Tim Hecker and Ben Frost. He tends to describes his music as deconstructionist, using samples from mainstream rap artists like Tyga but combined with his own dark, industrial beats.

Area C constitutes about 61 percent of the West Bank territory, and is committed under Oslo II to be \\"gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction\\". The Palestinian Authority is responsible for medical and educational services to Palestinians in Area C, however infrastructure construction is done by Israel. Area C, excluding East Jerusalem, is home to 385,900 Israeli settlers and approximately 300,000 Palestinians. The Jewish population in Area C is administered by the Israeli Judea and Samaria Area administration, whereas the Palestinian population is directly administered by the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories and indirectly by the Palestinian National Authority in Ramallah. The international community considers the settlements in occupied territory to be illegal,Civilian and military presence as strategies of territorial control: The Arab-Israel conflict, David Newman, Political Geography Quarterly Volume 8, Issue 3, July 1989, Pages 215‚Äì227 and the United Nations has repeatedly upheld the view that Israel's construction of settlements constitutes a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel disputes the position of the international community and the legal arguments that were used to declare the settlements illegal. The \\"outposts\\" are in contravention of Israeli law as well.  History  The Israeli Civil Administration was established by the government of Israel in 1981, in order to carry out practical bureaucratic functions within the territories occupied by Israel since 1967. While formally separate, it was subordinate to the Israeli military and the Shin Bet. The Civil Administration is a part of a larger entity known as Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which is a unit in the Defense Ministry of Israel. Its functions have largely been taken over by the Palestinian National Authority in 1994, however it still continues a limited operation to manage Palestinian population in the Area C of the West Bank and coordination with the Palestinian government.  Oslo Accords  The Oslo II Accord divided the West Bank into three administrative divisions: the Areas A, B and C. The distinct areas were given a different status, according to the amount of self-government the local Palestinians would have over it through the Palestinian Authority, until a final status accord would be established. The Areas A and B were chosen in such a way as to just contain Palestinians, by drawing lines around Palestinian population centers at the time the Agreement was signed; Area C was defined as \\"areas of the West Bank outside Areas A and B, which, except for the issues that will be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations, will be gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction in accordance with this Agreement.\\"What is Area C?. B'Tselem, 9 October 2013 Area A comprises approximately 18% of the West Bank and Area B about 22%, together home to some 2.8 million Palestinians. Area C was initially around 72‚Äì74% (first phase, 1995) of the West Bank. (this study was funded by the Settlement Division of the Zionist Organization)MFA, \\"Map No. 1 ‚Äì First Phase of Redeployment\\" Under the 1998 Wye River Memorandum, Israel would further withdraw from some additional 13% from Area C to Area B, which officially reduced Area C to circa 61% of the West Bank.New York Times, 23 July 2012, \\"Israel Seeks Army Use of West Bank Area\\"\\"West Bank: Area C Map\\".

In area B, consisting of about 23 percent of the territory (including some 440 villages and their surrounding lands), the Palestinians are responsible for certain municipal functions, while joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols maintain internal security. Area C, consisting of about 74 percent of the territory including all of the 145 settlements and the new Jewish neighborhoods in and around East Jerusalem, remains under full Israeli control. and during Operation Defensive Shield, it reoccupied all territory. As of 2013, Area C formally comprised about 63% of the West Bank, including settlements, outposts and declared \\"state land\\". Including or excluding East Jerusalem, no-man's land and the Palestinian part of the Dead Sea also determines the percentage.  Geography, resources and policy  Area C is richly endowed with natural resources, including most of Palestinian agricultural and grazing land. It is the only contiguous part of the West Bank, thus all large scale projects involve work in Area C.  Settlements and housing policy  Map of Israeli settlements (magenta), as of 2014 Modi'in Illit Area C, excluding East Jerusalem, is home to 385,900 Israeli settlers and approximately 300,000 Palestinians. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, Israeli planning and zoning regimes in Area C all but prohibit Palestinian construction in almost 70 percent this zone, and render the obtaining of permits in the remaining 30 percent nearly impossible.'Fact Sheet: Building Permits in Area C of the West Bank,' Norwegian Refugee Council Israel strictly controls Palestinian settlement, construction and development in Area C.in the 12 years from 2000 to 2012, only 211 Palestinian submissions for Israeli permits, out of 3,750 applications (5.6%) ‚Äì were approved. The figure tails off for the last 4 years, 2009 through 2012 with 37 permits given from among 1,640 applications (2.3%). By contrast, the same Civil Administration figures indicate that in approximately 75% of Israeli settlements, construction was undertaken without regard for the appropriate permits. According to a UNOCHA report, \\"The planning and zoning regime applied by the Israeli authorities, including the ways in which public land is allocated, makes it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits in most of Area C. Even basic residential and livelihood structures, such as a tent or a fence, require a building permit.\\" According to B'tselem: > Israel strictly limits Palestinian settlement, construction and development > in Area C,while ignoring the needs of the Palestinian population. This > policy means Palestinian residents must subsist in very rudimentary living > conditions. They are denied any legal avenue to build homes or develop their > communities, so they face the constant fear that their homes might be > demolished, and that they be expelled and lose their livelihood.Acting the > Landlord:Israel's Policy in Area C, the West Bank, B'tselem June 2013 p.5. Israel routinely issued demolition orders on Palestinian structures built without permits. Between 1988 and 2014, Israel issued 14,087 demolition orders, of which only a minority (20%) have been executed. The remaining orders do not expire, leaving the structures in a continuous state of uncertainty. = Positions on demolitions = According to the Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Conventions: > Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property > belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, > or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, > is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely > necessary by military operations. Israeli demolitions are based on British mandate planning rules, which are evoked to justify demolitions, but at the same time Israel does not employ the Mandatory provisions for the granting of construction permits, according to B'tselem. Israel defends its policy on three grounds. Firstly, it states that the demolitions satisfy Jordanian law, which was operative at the time Israel occupied the territories. Secondly, it states that its actions satisfy Article 43 of the Hague conventions. Thirdly, it states that under the 1995 Oslo Accords, it was agreed that planning and zoning in Area C would fall under the appropriate planning committees. Israel also defends demolitions in terms of the safety of the inhabitants of homes it demolishes because they have been built in closed military zones or firing zones. Israel has defined roughly 20% of the entire West Bank as \\"closed military areas\\" and 60% of the demolitions in 2010 took place in the latter.'Israel demolishes Palestinian homes in Nablus-area 'firing zone',' Ma'an News Agency 9 February 2016. Critics respond that the declaration of areas as Israeli closed military zones is a legal device adopted by the military authorities to deny Palestinians access to their land. B'tselem claims that the refusal of the military-run Civil Administration to set down development plans for Palestinian villages are based variously on arguments that such sites are either situated near archaeological areas, that communities can relocate to nearby Palestinian land reserves, and that what it defines as ‚Äúcollections of illegal structures‚Äù, though villages, were not planned. These arguments are applied when issuing demolition orders for villages that are built on village land, and have existed for decades.

It was developed for the German Army's Protected Command and Function (GFF) Group 2 requirement. The overall design of the AMPV has moved forward from the Cold War thinking of previous generation wheeled armoured vehicles, and throughout it has been optimised for current asymmetric conflict operations. According to the manufacturer, right from the outset, purely military requirements dictated AMPV's design. In the process, the development team took systematic account of experience gained during the ISAF mission in Afghanistan and other operations worldwide. As a result, the AMPV is now the best-protected vehicle in its class anywhere. History Development of the AMPV began in 2007, and a full- scale mockup was shown for the first time at Eurosatory 2008. The first fully functional prototype was shown for the first time in 2009. The German Army purchased the AMPV for extensive trials, these completed late in 2011. The AMPV was conceived as a family of vehicles that would meet a wide range of user requirements, and have gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) of between 5.3-tonnes (Type 1a & 1b) and 9.2-tonnes (Type 2a & 2b). Since conception, requirements have evolved and only Type 2 variants have been built, these now having a maximum permissible GVWR of 10.1-tonnes. The AMPV has been demonstrated overseas and during 2010 an example underwent a series of high altitude trials in Chile. These included 2800 km at heights up to 4800 m above sea level. By 2015 the AMPV had completed approaching 30,000 test km in all conditions. An AMPV optimised for special forces use was demonstrated in Poland during September 2015, this targeted at Poland's Pegaz project for special forces vehicles. This example featured a remotely operated weapon station made by Polish defence contractor Tarnow, armed with a heavy machine gun. Description The AMPV was designed by RMMV and KMW, with body styling by Porsche Design Studio. Unlike many vehicles of similar size/capacity, the AMPV is not based on a commercial chassis, but has been designed and built specifically to meet military requirements. The design of the AMPV is based around a central armoured crew cell/citadel, this having a multi-layered floor for enhanced mine blast protection. The self-supporting armoured steel citadel accepts add-on passive composite armour modules which can be changed as new armour technology evolves or the threat level changes. Crew survivability is enhanced by the installation of de-coupled seats. During trials, instrumented dummy crew members survived the blast from a 100 kg improvised explosive device (IED) that was exploded five metres from the AMPV citadel. AMPV also features built-in impact protection. The AMPV also features air-conditioning and a full NBC filtration and over-pressure system. The front power pack and rear cargo area are not protected and mount to sub-frames, the AMPV not having a conventional chassis. The rear cargo area can be configured to suit user requirements and features 2220 litres of usable stowage space. AMPV can tow a trailer of up to 3500 kg in weight. Motive power is provided by a Steyr Motors M16 SCI diesel engine that has the ability to operate for extended periods on high sulphur, low quality and military-specific fuels such as F34/JP-8. Twin 150A alternators provide electrical power for engine and associated systems, radios/communications equipment, and ancillaries such a remote weapon station. The optional remote weapon station can be fitted with a machine gun (up to 12.7 mm) or a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher. A protected ringmount with similar armament options can also be fitted. If necessary, the protection level can be enhanced still further by integrating additional assemblies. These include Rheinmetall's Acoustic Sniper Localisation System (ASLS) and Situational Awareness System (SAS), assuring 360¬∞ monitoring of the vehicle's surroundings. Rheinmetall's Rapid Obscurant System (ROSY) system for generating a smoke screen is an option. Unlike conventional smoke/obscurant systems, ROSY creates an instantaneous, extensive, multispectral interruption of the line of sight, including a dynamic wall of smoke/obscurant that provides moving objects with sustained protection and concealment. The under- development Active Protective System (APS) will be a further option. Gearbox is a fully automatic ZF unit, this coupled to a two-speed transfer case. The planetary hub-reduction drive axles have disc brakes and feature a central tire inflation system (CTIS) and anti-lock brakes (ABS). Tyres are 385/80R 20, wheels featuring runflat inserts as standard. Suspension is fully independent, each wheel featuring twin coil-over shock-absorbers supplemented by hydraulic bump stops. Suspension stroke is up to +/-150mm. The drivetrain features Steyr's Automatic Drivetrain Management (ADM). ADM automatically controls and monitors longitudinal and cross-axle differential locks, thereby reducing strain on the driver, with full drivetrain lock-up possible for maximum traction. RMMV literature states ADM offers advantages that include shorter driver training, longer service and maintenance intervals, prevention of damage by driver error or mistake, and longer tyre life. Performance capabilities include the ability to climb >70% grade, traverse >40% sideslope, surmount a 400mm vertical step, cross a 750 mm wide ditch, and ford 850 mm of water without preparation. Ground clearance is 350 mm, and turning circle is 15 m. AMPV is able to operate at temperatures ranging from -46 ¬∞C to +55 ¬∞C. Options can include a fire suppression system, a 360 degree camera system, a GPS system, and a front- or rear-mounting self-recovery winch. The AMPV can be transported by standard rail cars, or in the air by C-130 Hercules aircraft or as an underslung load by Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopter.

He lived from the era of Abbas I until the era of Suleiman I. He was Ali Reza Abbassi's student and was known as the Imam of calligraphers. Mohammad Reza Emami was Mohammad Mohsen Emami's father and Ali Naghi Emami's grandfather. All of the three calligraphers were famous for their Thuluth works in the Safavid era. Many inscriptions of the historical buildings in Isfahan, Mashhad, Qom and Qazvin have been created by them. When Ali Reza Abbassi started to work for Abbas I and became his close friend, Abbas I appointed him as the Thuluth script teacher of some other calligraphers like Mohammad Saleh Esfahani and Abdolbaghi Tabrizi. He died probably in Mashhad after 50 years working in the field of calligraphy.Andr√© Godard: AssƒÅr-e IrƒÅn (Annales du service arch√©ologiques de l'Iran). Aus dem Franz√∂sischen von Abolhassan Sarvghad Moghaddam. 3. Auflage. Astana Quds (Hrsg.) Seite 245, Maschhad 1996, Sprache: persisch  Works  Most of Emami's inscriptions are in Isfahan, but some of his works are also in Qom, Qazvin and Mashhad. His first inscription in Isfahan dates back to 1629 and his last inscription in Isfahan to 1670. His works from 1673 until 1676 are all in Mashhad, where he spent the last years of his life. Mohammad Reza Emami's famous works are in the Shah mosque. There is another inscription by Mohammad Reza Emami above the magnificent entrance of this historical mosque under a Thuluth script of Ali Reza Abbassi. An inscription on the southern dome is also Emami's work. Other works of Emami are as follows: * in Imam Reza shrine: There are three inscriptions of Emami in the Imam Reza shrine: ** an inscription on four slabs on the dome (above Ali Reza Abbassi's inscription). The inscription dates back to 1675 and belongs to the era of Suleiman I. The inscription mentions that there was an earthquake and the dome became cracked and some reparations and decorations were carried out on the dome. ** An inscription in the southern iwan. ** Baysunghur's inscription (Shah Rukh's son), which was repaired by Emami. * in the Goharshad mosque: in the middle of Goharshad mosque. * in the Hakim mosque: ** a white Thuluth script on the ultramarine tiles above the northern entrance. The inscription dates back to 1662. ** an inscription in the iwan: It shows some sentences from Koran and also Mohammad Reza Emami's name.

It is mentioned in the inscription, that the founder of mosque, Nour ed-Din Mohammad Esfahani, was a benefactor and began the construction of mosque during the era of Abbas I, but it was completed in the first year of King Safi's reign. * in the Lonban mosque: ** There are some white Thuluth lines on the ultramarine background of two tiles. The lines date back to 1669. ** Above the entrance, there are also some poems with white Nastaliq scripts on the ultramarine tiles. They date back also to 1669.

The Globe and Mail, October 27, 1996. although the application underwent numerous changes before being transferred to a separate company, unrelated to Soble's Niagara Television, in 1970. One indication of the esteem in which he was held was that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation offered him the job of president of the network in late 1966; but he decided to turn it down.Jack Miller. \\"Ken Soble: He Was the Choice for President in National TV.\\" Hamilton (CA) Spectator, December 17, 1966, p. 25.

Soble's entry into broadcasting occurred by accident, circa 1927,\\"Benefit Amateur Show Aids Crippled Children.\\" The Globe and Mail, March 22, 1947, p. 10. when he helped a woman who needed a ride to the radio station where she worked. Her name was Jane Gray, and she had a radio drama troupe, the Jane Gray Players.\\"Television's maverick station\\". The Globe and Mail, February 23, 1963. She showed her appreciation for the ride by giving him a chance to perform on the air.\\"Radio, TV stations grew from show\\". The Globe and Mail, December 17, 1966. From that unpaid position, Soble found paid work at several stations, selling air time, and doing some announcing of both music shows and sports programs.\\"Are You Listening?\\" Toronto Star, October 12, 1935, p. 29. By 1936, he had started his own broadcasting company, Metropolitan Broadcasting Service, Ltd.\\"Advertising Executive Enters Radio Field.\\" Toronto Star, August 22, 1936, p. 11. Around that time, he got the idea for a radio amateur hour, similar to those already on the air in the United States, such as the one hosted by Major Bowes. Ken Soble's Amateur Hour was first broadcast on CKCL in Toronto, but he was soon able to expand it to a regional network; ultimately, it aired across Canada and became one of the country's most popular programs, even though, by his own admission, the show was \\"corny.\\" \\"Ken Soble: He favored Anything That Worked.\\" Toronto Star, December 17, 1966, p. 17. Around 1936, after working for CKCL and then CFRB, he became general manager of CHML in Hamilton; only seven years later, at age 31, Soble was able to buy the station from the former owner, Senator Arthur Hardy in 1942 after winning a bidding war against Roy Thomson and Jack Kent Cooke. Meanwhile, during World War II, Soble decided to retire the Amateur Hour to concentrate on organizing entertainment programs for Canada's troops. But after the war, in 1946, the Amateur Hour returned to CHML by popular demand; Soble also used the program to stage benefit performances that raised funds for worthy causes, such as several hospitals, the Red Cross, and Easter Seals.Steve York. \\"The Man Who Couldn't Retire Restores His Amateur Show.\\" The Globe and Mail, May 25, 1957, p. 26. In addition to supporting national causes, Soble also funded the building of a Jewish Community Center in Hamilton. Successful executive Soble became known for his devotion to live and local radio. He believed that radio (and later television) should both entertain and inform the public. While popular programs like the Amateur Hour provided entertainment, he also wanted to further the mission of providing information. He felt strongly that radio should help the public to \\"keep tabs on their elected representatives,\\" so he began broadcasting Hamilton city council meetings on CHML in 1945. He also expanded his radio news staff to make sure they were thoroughly covering local politics.John X. Sanford. \\"The Reluctant Radio Stars.\\" Toronto Globe & Mail, May 4, 1957, p. B4. He was also able to repay the kindness that Jane Gray had shown him so many years ago: when she wanted to return to radio after some time away from broadcasting, he hired her at CHML and gave her an advice and interview program.\\"A Chance Car Ride Gave Him His Start.\\" Hamilton Spectator, December 17, 1966, p. 7. While well known as a radio executive, Soble was quick to embrace television. CHCH-TV, channel 11, in Hamilton, went on the air as a CBC affiliate in 1954,Jim Bawden. \\"When Hamilton Was Hot.\\" Toronto Star, June 5, 2004, p. J8. but in 1961, Soble decided to take the station independent. It worked out well: CHCH-TV became \\"the most profitable independent television station in Canada.\\" One especially popular program Soble created for the station was Tiny Talent Time, a talent show for children twelve years old and under. It debuted in 1957 and it ran for more than thirty years, until it was canceled in 1992.Jim Bawden. \\"Big Memories of Tiny Talent Reunion Ready to Bring Back Memories for Show's Host and Folks Who Were its Tiny Tots.\\" Toronto Star, September 21, 1997, p.

In addition to being a radio station manager and owner, and the owner of a sports franchise, he was asked by the mayor of Hamilton to help the city with its public housing crisis in 1961. He won public support for the city's urban renewal plans, and was subsequently appointed to the Ontario housing advisory committee, and became its chairman.

He had been ill for several weeks, and both overwork and exhaustion were cited as factors in his death. The official cause of death was a heart attack. He was only 55 years old. His death was mourned by political figures, broadcasting colleagues, and many people who regarded him as a humanitarian; even Canada's Prime Minister Lester Pearson issued a statement expressing his regrets.\\"Many Pay Tribute, Terrible Loss.\\" Hamilton Spectator, December 17, 1966, p. 7.

Wilkinson broke the color barrier in 1955 when she signed a contract to dance full-time with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She was promoted to soloist during her second season with the troupe, and remained with the company for six years. Wilkinson later became a mentor to American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Misty Copeland, presenting Copeland with the 2014 Dance Magazine Award. Former ballerina Raven Wilkinson and her friend artist Calida Garcia Rawles enjoying a summer day sitting on a park bench  Early life  Anne Raven Wilkinson was born in New York City on February 2, 1935, to Anne James Wilkinson and Dr. Frost Birnie Wilkinson, a dentist. She had a brother six years younger, Frost Birnie Wilkinson Jr. The family lived in a middle-class neighborhood in Harlem.\\"Anne Raven Wilkinson\\", BlackPast.org. Her father's office at 152nd Street and Amsterdam Avenue was located across the street from the Dance Theatre of Harlem.Michael Langlois, \\"A Conversation with Raven Wilkinson\\", Ballet Review, Fall 2007. Wilkinson became a ballet fan at the age of five after seeing Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo perform Coppelia.Margaret Fuhrer, \\"An Interview with Raven Wilkinson\\", Pointe Magazine, June‚ÄìJuly 2014. Her mother, who had studied ballet in Chicago, took young Raven to the School of American Ballet for lessons. But, they said they could not accept her until she was nine, so she initially trained in the Dalcroze method. According to Wilkinson, \\"It was basically eurhythmics and was all about music and tempi and meters.\\"\\"Raven Wilkinson: 2015 Dance/USA Trustee Awardee\\", Dance USA. For her ninth birthday, an uncle made her the gift of ballet lessons at the Swoboda School, later known as the Ballet Russe School. Wilkinson's first teachers included well-known dancers from Russia‚Äôs Bolshoi Theatre, Maria and Vecheslav Swoboda.\\"Raven Wilkinson\\", Andros on Ballet. Sergei Denham, director of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, bought the Swoboda School in 1951, giving Wilkinson an opportunity to audition for the troupe. Although she was light-skinned, acceptance into a ballet company was unlikely because of her race. Fellow ballet students also advised her not to seek a position.\\"Raven Wilkinson, Ballet Pioneer\\", African American Registry. But, in 1954, Wilkinson auditioned for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She was rejected. On a second attempt, she was rejected once again. On her third try, in 1955, Denham informed her that she had been accepted on a six-week trial basis. She was 20 years old.  Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo  Wilkinson advanced to the position of soloists in her second season with Ballet Russe and remained with the group for six years. She performed with the company across the U.S., routinely dancing the waltz solo in Les Sylphides.Rivka Galchen, \\"An Unlikely Ballerina\\", The New Yorker, September 22, 2014. Her repertoire also included roles in Ballet Imperial, Le Beau Danube, Capriccio Espagnol, Gaite Parisienne, Giselle, Graduation Ball, Harlequinade, Swan Lake, and Variations Classiques. As an African American, she faced many difficulties while on tour, particularly in the segregated South. When the troupe stayed in \\"whites only\\" hotels, Wilkinson kept her race a secret. She later told an interviewer, \\"I didn‚Äôt want to put the company in danger, but also never wanted to deny what I was. If someone questioned me directly, I couldn‚Äôt say, 'No, I‚Äôm not black.'\\" For two years, things went well. Because there were many foreign dancers in the company, including a number of South Americans, her skin color was not an issue. In 1957, however, she was barred from staying with the troupe when an Atlanta, Georgia, hotel owner asked her outright if she was black. Wilkinson refused to lie and was sent away in a \\"colored\\" taxi to a \\"colored\\" motel. During the same tour, members of the Ku Klux Klan interrupted a Montgomery, Alabama, performance, asking, \\"Where's the nigger?\\"Lindsey Bever, \\"Misty Copeland‚Äôs mentor: The courageous black ballerina who defied racism\\", The Washington Post, July 1, 2015. As word of Wilkinson's racial identity spread, discrimination became increasingly problematic in both her personal and professional life. Denham forbid her from dancing in certain locations and sent her ahead to safer cities on the tour. Ultimately, one of the company's ballet mistresses told her she would not go any further in her ballet career and should leave to start a school of African dance. Exhausted by years of discrimination, as well as the belief that the financially stressed troupe had become old-fashioned, Wilkinson left the company in 1961.  Between ballet companies  Following her departure from Ballet Russe, Wilkinson auditioned for several U.S.-based ballet companies, including New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, and the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. But, she was not accepted. Disheartened, she stopped dancing for two years. Wilkinson worked briefly in customer service for a New York department store. Then, because she had always been attracted to the spiritual life, she joined an Anglican convent in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. She stayed for only six months as she soon realized she had been given a great gift she had not used to its fullest. She returned to ballet classes, and not long after, to performing when and where she could.  Dutch National Ballet  In the mid-1960s, Sylvester Campbell, an African-American principal dancer with the Dutch National Ballet, suggested Wilkinson approach that company. After speaking with them, she was invited to join the troupe as second soloist. She moved to the Netherlands in 1967 and stayed with the National Ballet for seven years. She performed in Les Sylphides, The Firebird, Serenade, Giselle, Mozartiana, Concerto Barocco, Swan Lake, Symphony in C, La Valse, The Snow Maiden and Graduation Ball.Joselli Deans, \\"Black Ballerinas Dancing on the Edge: An Analysis of the Cultural Politics in Delores Browne's and Raven Wilkinson's Careers, 1954‚Äì1985\\". Temple University, 2001. In 1974, at the age of 38, a homesick Wilkinson retired and returned to the U.S.  New York City Opera  Wilkinson did not stay in retirement long. When she returned to New York, the New York City Opera asked her to dance. She performed with them from 1974 until 1985.

She was the first woman ever to be nominated for the Virginia House of Delegates; with Sarah Lee Fain, in 1923, she was one of the first two women elected to that body, and to the Virginia General Assembly as a whole. Life and career Helen Timmons was born on May 23, 1877 Cass County, Missouri, where her parents were visiting, and grew up in Jefferson County, Tennessee. She attended Carson‚ÄìNewman College in Jefferson City, Tennessee, where she studied to become a schoolteacher; one of her professors there was Robert Anderson Henderson, whom she would later marry. Upon her marriage she moved with her husband to Buchanan County, Virginia; there she was shocked by the limited educational opportunities available in southwest Virginia, and began efforts to correct the deficit. These culminated in the foundation of the Baptist Mountain School in Council, in 1911, at which organization she served as assistant principal; her husband was the principal. The leadership qualities she evinced in her role convinced a group of local Democratic Party leaders to suggest, in 1923, that she run for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates. She acquiesced, and proved to be not only an excellent campaigner, but a fine public speaker as well; unusually for the time, she drove her own car between campaign stops, and would sometimes speak at two in the same day. Henderson won election that November by a margin of over 400 votes. The town of Council was at the time so remote that it took two days for news of her election to trickle in. The Richmond Times-Dispatch described Henderson's opposition as coming \\"from some independent Democrats, Republicans, and wets\\", the latter referring to opponents of Prohibition. Of her role in Richmond, Henderson said: \\"I'm not in the Legislature for publicity. It's simply a question of public service with me, and a duty I owe to the people back in those counties which have elected me.\\" While in the General Assembly Henderson gained a reputation as an advocate for the interests of southwest Virginia, calling for more funding for roads and schools. She was the first woman to preside over the Assembly, and sat on four Committees: Roads and Internal Navigation; Counties, Cities, and Towns; Moral and Social Welfare; and Executive Expenditures. Her health, however, had begun to fail in the spring of 1925, and she returned to her parents' home in Jefferson City; she died there in July, without the chance to run for reelection, although she had been unanimously renominated. At her death governor E. Lee Trinkle praised her \\"many virtues, clear vision and noble aspirations\\", and ordered flags at the capitol building to be flown at half- staff in her honor. Henderson is buried at Elm Grove Cemetery in Knoxville, Tennessee. Henderson's daughter, Helen Ruth Henderson, would follow in her mother's footsteps, both as a schoolteacher and as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, to which body she was first elected in 1927; in the 1928 session she was one of four women serving in the House. She was the first woman to succeed her mother in the Virginia legislature, and the two were the first mother-daughter pair elected to any state legislature in the United States, followed soon after by Nellie Nugent Somerville and Lucy Somerville Howorth of Mississippi. With her husband Henderson also had a son, Robert Ashby Henderson. Honors The House of Delegates adopted the following resolution in memory of Helen Henderson: A historical marker honoring Henderson in Buchanan County was erected in 2010 by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. A portion of Virginia Route 80 is named the \\"Helen Henderson Highway\\" in her honor, and she was inducted in 2013 into the Southwest Virginia Walk of Fame, located at the Southwest Virginia Museum Historical State Park in Big Stone Gap.

It is one of THPRD's two nature parks along with Cooper Mountain Nature Park. The park features of trails, of which 1.5 miles are paved and 3.5 miles unpaved. The park features a diverse environment including several types of both evergreen and deciduous trees as well as creeks, wetlands, ponds, and meadows. Located on 15655 S.W. Millikan Way, at the main entrance to the park, is the Tualatin Hills Nature Center, formerly called the Tualatin Hills Nature Park Interpretive Center. The name was changed in November 2014. Nature supervisor Kristin Atman said that \\"six words is really a mouthful\\" and the new name would be more consistent with THPRD's other facilities. History Before being developed with trails and opened to the public, the site was known as St. Mary's Woods. It was still known by that name when it was acquired by THPRD from the Archdiocese of Portland in 1981 after local voters approved a tax levy providing $5.5 million towards the purchase cost. By 1984, when periodic tours of the still mostly undeveloped site gave the first regular public access, the site had been named the Tualatin Hills Nature Park. In September 2013, a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted at the park. Police later said she admitted she made the story up. Access Although the Nature Center on Millikan Way is the primary access point, the park can also be accessed at several other locations, including two trail entrances along S.W. 170th Avenue and a trail entrance adjacent to the Merlo Rd/SW 158th Ave MAX Station. THPRD's Westside Trail skirts the east side of the park and THPRD plans to connect the park with downtown Beaverton via the Beaverton Creek Trail. Washington County has also identified potential road improvements along SW 170th Avenue, which would improve access to the park from the west.https://www.co.washington.or.us/lut/divisions/longrangeplanning/planningprograms/transportationplanning/170thmerlo/index.cfm References Category:Parks in Washington County, Oregon Category:Nature centers in Oregon Category:Beaverton, Oregon Category:1984 establishments in Oregon Category:Protected areas established in 1984 Category:Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation District ","title":"Tualatin Hills Nature Park"},{"id":"47749370","text":"'Tabriz and Suburbs Bus Company (') is a public transport agency running Transit buses in Tabriz city and surrounding satellite cities and settlements in central East Azerbaijan Province.

One focus of her work is on the Chinese American immigrant identity and experience in the United States. She has published a collection of poetry called Dear Jenny, We Are All Find and a non-fiction chapbook called Hags. From 2011 to 2014, Zhang wrote extensively for Rookie. Additionally, Zhang has worked as a freelance essayist for other publications. In August 2017, Zhang's short story collection, Sour Heart, was the first acquisition by Lena Dunham's Lenny imprint, Lenny Books, via Random House. Early life Zhang was born in Shanghai, China. When she was five years old, Zhang immigrated to New York City to join her father, who was studying linguistics at New York University, and mother, who had come to the United States after the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Her father withdrew from the PhD program he was enrolled in, began to work as a teacher, and re-enrolled in school for computer programming, with the family eventually moving to Long Island where her father ran a computer repair business. She has a younger brother. In 2005, Zhang graduated from Stanford University with a BA in Comparative Studies in Race & Ethnicity. In 2009, Zhang received a Master of Fine Arts in fiction from the Iowa Writers' Workshop.  Career  After college, Zhang moved to San Francisco where she worked as a union organizer for Chinese home healthcare workers and as an organizer for the writing non- profit 826 Valencia which helps children and young adults learn how to write. Zhang spent a summer in Hungary teaching English as a second language. While in graduate school at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Zhang taught creative writing to undergraduates at University of Iowa. Zhang then taught high school students in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. She has also taught at the New School For Social Research and at Sackett Street Writers' Workshop. From 2011 to 2014, Zhang was a regular contributor to the online magazine for teen girls, Rookie, for which she has written both fiction and nonfiction since the magazine's inception. Among the essays Zhang wrote for Rookie were a 2012 tribute to the rapper M.I.A., The Importance of Angsty Art, an essay on embracing \\"bad\\" writing, Odd Girl In, an essay about the conflict between the impulse to rebel and the desire to join political movements, partly based on Zhang's experiences with organizing and activism in San Francisco, Empathy Excess, an essay about emotional abuse and the limits of empathy, and Far Away From Me, an essay about the search for decolonized love, a conflicted teenage love for Weezer, and a deconstruction and investigation into fetishization, objectification, and internalized racism. In 2012, Zhang published a collection of poetry called Dear Jenny, We Are All Find. Zhang had written some of the poems that made up the collection during her time at Iowa Writers' Workshop, which she did in secret as the poetry program was separate from her fiction program. She wrote the rest of the poems while living in the south of France. The poems were submitted to a contest for a small press, Octopus Books. In 2014, Lena Dunham asked her to join a promotional tour for her book, Not That Kind of Girl. This later led to Dunham publishing Zhang's 2017 book, Sour Heart. 2015's \\"Hags\\" is an essay Zhang wrote in one night after watching Senator Wendy Davis do a 13-hour filibuster of SB5, a Texas Senate bill that sought to limit access to abortion services. It was then published by Guillotine Books as a limited edition chapbook. In July 2015, Zhang published an essay called \\"How It Feels\\" for an issue of Poetry magazine that was curated by Tavi Gevinson. The essay was a meditation on depression, suicide, excess, Tracey Emin, and poetry. It was nominated for a National Magazine Award. In August 2015, one of Zhang's stories was included in the first issue of Lena Dunham's Lenny newsletter. In September 2015, Zhang wrote about issues of racism in the literary community for BuzzFeed. In August 2017, Zhang's short story collection, Sour Heart, was published by Lena Dunham's Lenny Books imprint on Random House. Many of the stories were written and evolved over a long period of time, with the oldest having initially been written when Zhang was 19 years old, the short story called \\"The Evolution of My Brother.\\" Zhang said that the title and theme of the book came from a wish \\"to convey the unreality of childhood, the sweetness and the sourness of being so small, so helpless, and so dependent on adults. We tend to render childhood as purely idyllic and innocent, or totally nightmarish and traumatic, but there's a spectrum of nuance that lies between.\\" Sour Heart, a group of seven bildungsroman stories, received positive reviews. In May 2019, it was announced that Sour Heart would be made into a movie, to be directed by Cathy Yan.

History Clyde moved to Barrowfield Park in 1877, initially groundsharing with Albatross,Origins - Barrowfield Park - 1877-98 Clyde FC and during the next thirteen years a cycle track was created around the pitch, an uncovered seated stand was built on the eastern side of the pitch and a pavilion erected in the south-eastern corner of the ground, whilst embankments were developed at the north and south ends of the pitch.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p152 Clyde joined the Scottish Football League in 1891, and the first league game at Barrowfield Park was played on 15 August, with Clyde beating Vale of Leven 10‚Äì3; the scoreline remained the club's record home league win at the ground, and was also the first double-digit scoreline in SFL history. A fortnight later the ground's record league attendance was set when 10,000 watched a 7‚Äì2 defeat to Glasgow rivals Celtic. This was equalled for a Scottish Cup fifth third-round game against Rangers on 6 February 1892. As the SFL grew in popularity, Barrowfield Park became increasingly ill-suited to hosting league football; many spectators able to get into the ground without paying and opposition clubs complained about the lack of facilities. With the club's lease about to expire, the club moved to the Shawfield Stadium in 1898. The final league game was played at Barrowfield Park on 3 January 1898, with Clyde losing 4‚Äì2 to Hibernian. The last game of any form was a friendly against Sunderland on 30 April, with the game finishing 3‚Äì3. The site was later used for housing and a school, the facade of which survives into the 21st century. =Continuation of the name= The ground's name would appear to originate from the historic Barrowfield estate which once occupied much of the surrounding area; there was also a large dye works of that name nearby. In the 1930s a housing scheme located about half a mile to the north would also take the Barrowfield name, and when local Junior club Bridgeton Waverley were displaced by this residential development, they named their replacement home in the Parkhead district 'New Barrowfield'.

After that he became Captain of the Boys‚Äô Training Establishment in January 1959, Flag Officer Submarines in September 1961, and Chief Polaris Executive in spring 1963 before retiring in September 1968.  Early life  Hugh Stirling Mackenzie was born in Inverness, Scotland, on 3 July 1913, the son of Dr Theodore Charles Mackenzie, the medical superintendent of the Inverness District Asylum, and his wife, Margaret (Madge) Wilson. His home, and birthplace, was Ruigh-Ard, the superintendent's residence. He had two older brothers, Charles and Alec, and a younger sister, Margaret. At the age of nine, he was sent to Cargilfield Preparatory School, where his brother Charles was head boy, followed by his brother Alec the next year. In 1924, he appeared before the interview board and was given a medical examination as the first steps to admission to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. He was initially rejected on the grounds of deficient eyesight, but his father lodged an appeal, and had his sight examined by an eye specialist in Edinburgh, who declared that it met the Navy's standards. Another test at Queen Anne's Mansions in London cleared the way for him to sit the entrance examinations, which he passed.  Early naval career  Mackenzie entered the Royal Naval College in January 1927, one of 51 members of the Anson Term, three of whom would not graduate in July 1930. They then received leave that lasted until September, which Mackenzie spent at home with his parents and three siblings at Ruigh-Ard. Due to cutbacks, there was no Cadet Training Cruiser for the class, and they were posted to the fleet for additional training. Mackenzie was posted to the battleship , part of the Mediterranean Fleet's 1st Battle Squadron. He embarked for the Mediterranean on the P&O; ocean liner , on which the new fleet commander, Admiral Sir William Wordsworth Fisher, was also travelling, completing the voyage on the battleship . In addition to service on Ramillies, Mackenzie, who was promoted from officer cadet to midshipman on 1 May 1931, spent a fortnight on the aircraft carrier and three months on the destroyers and in the summer of 1932 in order to gain familiarity with the work of various ships of the fleet. At the conclusion of his tour of duty in the Mediterranean in July 1933, Mackenzie passed his sub lieutenant's examination, and returned to England on the destroyer to rejoin the Anson Term for the six-month sub lieutenant's course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. After coursework that was interrupted by an operation on his left inner ear at the Royal Naval Hospital, Chatham, the midshipmen moved on to specialist courses in gunnery, torpedo, navigation and signals at , , and . He was promoted to sub lieutenant, with seniority backdated to 16 March 1934. Not liking the life on battleships, he applied for submarine duty. He was accepted, and sent to in January 1935, where he was trained as a submariner. Mackenzie was posted to , one of the boats of the 4th Submarine Flotilla, which was based in Hong Kong as part of the China Station. During the summer, the flotilla moved north to Weihaiwei to escape the heat and humidity. He was promoted to lieutenant, with seniority backdated to 16 October 1935, and returned to England via Japan and the Trans-Canada Railway in August 1937. He joined the 2nd Submarine Flotilla, which was part of the Home Fleet, and based at Devonport. He was given command of HMS Mist, an old coal burner that was manned by spare crewmen assigned to the flotilla and commanded by the spare lieutenant. Soon after, the Mist was ordered to join the Reserve Fleet, into which she was reluctantly accepted. In May 1938, Mackenzie was assigned to .

Torpedo hands at the three port forward tubes. Osiris had eight tubes, six forward and two aft. In April 1939, Mackenzie was posted to . The boat was almost lost during a test dive when a rivet popped out. On 27 September 1939, Osiris sailed for Malta to join the 1st Submarine Flotilla. She embarked on her first war patrol on 31 May 1940, and was at sea when Italy declared war on the UK on 10 June 1940. On the night of 16 August, Osiris was on her third war patrol, attempting to interdict shipping between Italy and Albania, when she sighted a cargo ship off the Albanian coast. The ship, the Morea, was empty and riding high in the water. Two torpedoes were fired at range, but apparently passed beneath her. Osiris then closed to within and fired two more torpedoes, which also missed. She then surfaced and engaged Morea with her deck gun. Despite the brilliant flashes and considerable noise from the deck gun, there was no sign of activity on board, and shells were pumped into Morea until she started to sink. Osiris departed Malta for her next war patrol on 9 September 1940, returning to the same vicinity. She found the area rich with targets moving troops and supplies from Italy to Albania for what would soon be revealed to be the Italian invasion of Greece. Osiris attempted to engage them, but for one reason or another, a whole series of attacks failed. On 13 September, she fired two salvoes of two torpedoes each at a range of at a convoy of three ships escorted by destroyers; all missed. But on 22 September she fired a full six-torpedo spread at a convoy at range. At first the crew thought that the torpedoes had again missed; but then there was an explosion, and the Italian torpedo boat Palestro was sunk. On returning to Alexandria, a launch brought the Osiris a Jolly Roger, which she flew to indicate a success. It was Mackenzie's last patrol in Osiris. He received orders to return to England for the \\"Perisher\\", the five-week submarine Commanding Officers Qualifying Course. Because the Mediterranean was closed due to the war, he had to sail round the Cape of Good Hope in the . He was formally declared to have qualified for command of a submarine in February 1941, and assigned to the 7th Submarine Flotilla as a spare commanding officer.

Heading down Lough Foyle in the early morning darkness on 10 March showing navigation lights, she encountered the heading in the opposite direction on the port (incorrect) side. As Lairdsbank approached the submarine, but without sighting it, she suddenly veered to starboard. Mackenzie ordered \\"full astern\\", but the two collided. Fortunately, although the bow of H28 was crumpled, the boat remained watertight, and Mackenzie was able to return to Derry for repairs. Lairdsbank suffered no damage and was unaware that there had been a collision. Admiral Max Horton told Mackenzie not to do it again. On 14 April, Mackenzie assumed command of another training boat, . = Thrasher = In June 1941, Mackenzie received orders to rejoin the Mediterranean Fleet. This time he travelled to Alexandria through the Mediterranean as a passenger on the submarine . On 12 October, he assumed command of the submarine . A few days later he set out on his first war patrol in her (but Thrashers fifth), sinking an Italian schooner with the deck gun, and unsuccessfully engaged an Italian minesweeper. On the next patrol, Mackenzie attacked a three-ship convoy on 25 November, sinking the Italian cargo ship Attilio Deffenu with a torpedo. Thrasher had orders to insert a party of Yugoslav agents under the command of Stanislav Rapotec, but the mission was cancelled and Thrasher returned them to Alexandria. Thrasher set out again in January 1942, and found a large ship with an escort. Failing to gain a firing position, Mackenzie surfaced, overtook them, and attacked, sinking the Italian cargo ship Fedora. Gould, VC, stands in the casing-hatch through which bomb from A1 was dragged. Thrasher set out on her eighth war patrol on 13 February 1942. Off Suda Bay, Crete, Mackenzie found the German merchant ship Arkadia. It had five escorts, which Mackenzie took to be an indication that it was important. He fired a salvo of four torpedoes, and believed that he had hit something, but all missed. Thrasher was engaged by aircraft and surface ships, which dropped 33 depth charges. After Thrasher surfaced that night, two unexploded bombs were discovered. The first was disposed of by being dragged forward and lowered over the bow. The second presented more difficulty. On reading the patrol report, Admiral Andrew Cunningham ordered Mackenzie to write up the incident for gallantry awards to Roberts and Gould. They were awarded the Victoria Cross. On 9 April, Mackenzie attacked a convoy. He fired a salvo of three torpedoes at the Italian merchant ship Gala. Although he observed a hit, he saw no evidence that it had sunk. It had. He attacked another small convoy on 13 April, sinking the German army cargo ship Atlas, which was struck by two torpedoes from a three torpedo salvo. Escort vessels dropped 19 depth charges on Thrasher. When she came up to periscope depth, Mackenzie saw one escort and a lighter. The escort left to rejoin the convoy, and Mackenzie surfaced in broad daylight and sank the lighter, the Italian Pilo 210 with his deck gun. On her tenth patrol, Mackenzie attacked the Italian armed merchant cruiser Brioni on 16 May, but she spotted the torpedoes and evaded them. Three days later he attacked and sank the Italian merchant ship Penelope. On her eleventh war patrol, Mackenzie sighted two cargo ships escorted by the Italian torpedo boat Perseo, and sank the Italian merchant Sant Antonio. Six days later he sighted the Italian sloop Diana, Mussolini's yacht, and sank it. On 4 July, a German U-boat, , was sighted, but it evaded both Thrashers torpedoes and her gunfire. Thrasher was attacked by a Fleet Air Arm Fairey Swordfish of No. 815 Squadron on 26 July, causing considerable damage. After repairs were effected, Thrasher set out again in September. Responding to a report from a shadowing Vickers Wellington bomber of an enemy ship escorted by two destroyers, Thrasher raced to intercept them on 4 September. This was the Italian merchant ship Padenna, escorted by the Spica-class torpedo boats Castore and Lupo. Mackenzie lined up an attack, but was thwarted at the last minute by the escorts. He then fired a salvo of three torpedoes from the stern torpedo tubes. Two hit, and the Wellington pilot reported that the ship blew up. On the next patrol Mackenzie sank a couple of schooners with gunfire on 12 October, the Italian tugboat Roma on 19 October, and the Italian merchant ship Lero on 20 October. Thrasher made an abortive attack on two merchant ships on 25 October, and was subjected to a severe depth charging by the two escorts, but managed to get away. This was Mackenzie's last war patrol in Thrasher, which now returned to the UK. He was credited with sinking of enemy shipping. He was made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order on 30 June 1942, and was promoted to lieutenant commander on 23 October, with seniority of 16 October. He was awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order on 19 January 1943. He was sent on a publicity tour to increase public awareness of the role that submarines were playing in the conflict, and appeared in a war movie, We Dive at Dawn. = Tantalus = On 2 April 1943, Mackenzie assumed command of the submarine , a new boat which departed the builder's yard at Barrow-in-Furness on 31 May 1943. After a work- up patrol in the Norwegian Sea, Tantalus was assigned to the 4th Submarine Flotilla, which was part of the Eastern Fleet, and based at Trincomalee, Ceylon. She departed in January 1944, and conducted three war patrols in the Straits of Malacca between April and August 1944, sinking two Malaysian tug boats by gunfire, the Kampung Besar on 19 April and the Pulo Salanama on 29 April. On 3 May, Mackenzie torpedoed and sank the Japanese Army cargo ship Amagi Maru, and on 10 June sank the small Japanese army cargo ship Hiyoshi Maru with gunfire. He sighted the on 17 July, but it suddenly altered course and Mackenzie did not fire his torpedoes. It did not get away, however, as it was sunk by later that day. in Plymouth Sound in August 1945 As the picking seemed slim, the decision was taken to form a new submarine flotilla, the 8th Submarine Flotilla, based at Fremantle, Western Australia, as part of the British Pacific Fleet, although it would be under the operational control of COMSUBSOUWESPAC, Rear Admiral James Fyfe, USN. Mackenzie broke his ribs, so Lieutenant J. Nash took Tantalus on a war patrol to Australia, while Mackenzie travelled to Fremantle on the submarine depot ship . With Mackenzie back in command on the next war patrol, Tantalus attacked a convoy on 2 November. He torpedoed and sank the Japanese cargo ship Hachijin Maru, and damaged one of the escorts, the Japanese submarine chaser Ch-1. He also sank a small Japanese coaster, Pahang Maru on 7 November that was heading to Bangkok with 75 drums of oil fuel and 9 drums of lubricating oil. Tantalus plucked eleven survivors from the water: nine Malays, a Chinese and a Japanese soldier. The Malays were transferred to the next junk Tantalus encountered, while the other two were taken to Australia, where the Japanese soldier was handed over to the Australian Army. On 21 November Tantalus landed a party on Merapas Island in support of Operation Rimau, but the commandos that they expected to find were not there. In January 1945, Tantalus conducted a 55-day patrol covering , making it the longest patrol of any British submarine during the war. The vessels sunk were small, and at one point ten Chinese and two Japanese were picked up from a fishing boat that Tantalus sank. The big game was sighted on 11 February 1945: the Japanese battleship-carriers and and the light cruiser , escorted by the destroyers , and , bound for Japan. Unfortunately, Mackenzie was unable to manoeuvre Tantalus into a firing position. Tantalus returned home in March 1945. Mackenzie was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on 19 June 1945.  Post-war career  Mackenzie was posted to Derry, where he was part of a group of submariners in charge of about fifty German Type VII, Type IX and Type XXI U-boats that had surrendered. While there, he met Third Officer Helen Maureen Bradish-Ellames, a Women's Royal Naval Service officer who worked on the staff in Derry. In January 1946, with the war over, he became an instructor on the Perisher course. He was promoted to commander on 12 July 1946, with seniority of 30 June 1946. He married Maureen Bradish- Ellames on 10 August 1946; they had a son and two daughters. In January 1948, Mackenzie became staff Officer, Operations, (SOO) on the staff of the Flag Officer Submarines, Rear Admiral Sir John Mansfield, despite having never attended the staff college course. After so many years in submarines, he expressed a desire to return to the surface navy in 1950, and was posted to the cruiser , the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean, as its executive officer. He was promoted to captain on 31 December 1951. Mackenzie's next assignment was as commanding the Underwater Detection Establishment (UDE), a post normally held by an anti-submarine specialist rather than a submariner and was commander of the 1st Destroyer Squadron from June 1954 until December 1956. During a training exercise, his ship, was damaged in a collision with the aircraft carrier . Mackenzie received a dressing down from the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Lord Mountbatten. He returned to submarines as Chief of Staff to the Flag Officer Submarines, Rear Admiral Wilfrid Woods, and then Rear Admiral Bertram Taylor. On a visit to the United States, he was given a tour of the first nuclear- powered submarine, the . After that he became Captain of the Boys' Training Establishment at Shotley, Suffolk, in January 1959. While there he completed the two-month Senior Officer's War Course at Greenwich. Promoted to rear admiral on 7 July 1961, Mackenzie became Flag Officer Submarines in September 1961. He visited Australia in March 1962, and inspected the submarines of the 4th Submarine Flotilla based there, , and . He warned the Australian government that Britain could no longer afford to maintain submarines in Australia, and recommended that Australia acquire its own submarines, preferably nuclear-powered. The advice did not go down well, but within a few years the British boats were withdrawn, and the Royal Australian Navy acquired diesel-powered s to replace them. Mackenzie's tenure as Flag Officer Submarines was brief. On 26 December 1962 he was notified that he would be appointed the Chief Polaris Executive (CPE). He described this as \\"the most strenuous five years of my whole career, but also in the end the most satisfying, because of their direct contribution to the ultimate defence of this country.\\" He established his office and that of his immediate staff in London, which he considered was necessary in order to be in immediate contact with the Admiralty, the Ministers, and the key departments. He was initially given two rooms and a closet at the Admiralty. Most of the Polaris Executive was located in Bath, Somerset, where the Admiralty's technical and logistics departments had been relocated in 1938. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1963 New Year Honours, promoted to vice admiral on 19 August 1964, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1966 Birthday Honours. The Polaris project was completed on time, with the first successful firing of a Polaris missile conducted off Cape Canaveral on 15 February 1968, and within budget.  Later life  Mackenzie retired on 20 September 1968. He was chairman of the Navy League of Great Britain from 1969 to 1974, and the director of the Atlantic Salmon Research Trust from 1969 to 1979, and was its chairman from 1979 to 1983. In July 1982, he was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident on the M1 motorway. An overtaking vehicle careened into the back of his car and knocked it off the road. The petrol tank ruptured and the car caught on fire. Despite burns to 15 per cent of his body, he was able to drag clear his wife Maureen, who suffered burns to 40 per cent of her body. Both were admitted to the burns unit at the Leicester Royal Infirmary. Mackenzie published his memoirs, titled The Sword of Damocles, in 1995. On 28 March 1996, he attended a ceremony at the submarine base at Faslane, to mark the decommissioning of , the last of the four s whose construction he had overseen in the 1960s. On 8 October 1996, he suffered a fatal heart attack at his home Puttenham, Surrey. A service of thanksgiving was held in Guildford Cathedral on 8 February 1997. His remains were cremated, and the ashes buried near Inverness.

Johnson, was the head pastor at Pratt Memorial United Methodist Church in Jackson, Mississippi. After heading the church for four years, L. E. Johnson became district superintendent of the Jackson District. Johnson was an officer in the United States Army. Minister In 1963, Johnson, like his father once had, became the head pastor at Pratt Memorial United Methodist Church in Jackson, Mississippi. Johnson helped the church with fundraising and organization. Johnson organized an inspirational choir, a youth choir and a children's choir. With the fruits of Johnson's fundraising efforts, funds were used to pay off the church and parsonage indebtedness. Civil rights movement leader =Evers march= In 1963, after Medgar Evers was assassinated by white supremacists for his civil rights leadership, an estimated five thousand people marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to the Collins Funeral Home on North Farish Street in Jackson. Johnson, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders led the procession. =Southern Christian Leadership Conference= In 1966, Johnson hosted the Tenth Annual Southern Christian Leadership Conference at the Masonic Temple in Jackson. The theme of the conference was human rights - the continuing struggle. Those in attendance, among others, included: Dr. King, Edward Kennedy, James Bevel, Ralph Abernathy, Curtis W.

Dr. King spoke of his dream \\"that one day the empty stomachs of Mississippi will be filled, that the idle industries of Appalachia will be revitalized.\\" Johnson prayed from the thirteenth chapter of Hebrews: \\"Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unaware. Remember them that are in bonds as though bond with them, and them which suffer adversity, as being ourselves also in body.\\" =Klan bombing= In the fall of 1967, the Ku Klux Klan placed a bomb under the floor of a parsonage where Johnson and his family slept. The parsonage was connected to St. Paul's United Methodist Church in Laurel, Mississippi. However, no one was injured when the bomb exploded. Allen Johnson and his family were targeted because he was an activist in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the larger civil rights movement. The bombing was part of several months of violence by the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi. The morning after the bombing, Johnson's wife sent her children to school so that everyone in town knew that the Johnson family was not intimidated by the bombing. =NAACP= Johnson was active in the NAACP. At one time, Johnson was the Mississippi NAACP assistant field secretary.

In the spring of 1967, Johnson coordinated eight MVREL seminars to train people in voter registration. =Business leader= Johnson led a businessman's parade in Jackson and was beaten during that peaceful demonstration. Johnson recalled: \\"It was during this demonstration that this white man who struck me said, 'You cannot walk on our street.' We have heard them say, 'My state.' We want to say, 'Our state.' We have fought for it, we have bled for it, we are concerned, our children are in it, and we want to help it.\\" =Political involvement= Johnson was interested in politics and considered running for public office. Around 1967, Johnson and Charles Evers decided to start a very quiet whispering campaign that encouraged blacks to vote for William Winter in the Mississippi's governor's race. The leaders whispered because any public expression of black support would have damaged a white candidate in the eyes of many white voters. In 1968, with the support of the Mississippi AFL-CIO, Johnson coordinated workshops that taught African-Americans how to participate in local Democratic party meetings. Johnson and other activists aimed to send a delegation to the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

In 1923, Fain and fellow schoolteacher Helen Timmons Henderson became the first two women elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. Early life and education Born in Norfolk, Virginia, Sarah Lee Odend'hal was educated locally first at Leache-Wood Seminary (founded by Irene Leache (1839‚Äì1900) and Anna Cogswell Wood (1850‚Äì1940)). She graduated from Hemmingway High School in 1907. Virginia career Odend'hal then embarked on a teaching career, spending twelve years in the city's public schools as both a teacher and administrator, while taking summer courses through the University of Virginia. The University did not directly offer diplomas to women, but the work she did in her summer courses provided her with the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in education and administration. Odend'hal married Army officer and architect Walter Colquitt Fain on September 8, 1917, and began a career in civic life shortly thereafter. Since few married woman at the time continued their schoolteaching jobs, she turned her attention to her husband's construction firm, becoming its secretary and treasurer. She also began her public life, by becoming active in organizations including the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the local Episcopal Church. Fain's first volunteer activity came when she supported the American Red Cross and sold Liberty bonds to support the American effort in World War I. When the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920, Fain joined the local branch of the League of Women Voters and became active in local Democratic Party politics, although she had not previously been particularly known as a suffragist nor had she joined the local branch of the Equal Suffrage League. Her success at convincing Norfolk's female voters to re-elect U.S. Senator Claude A. Swanson in 1922 led Fain's friends to urge her to run for a seat in Virginia's House of Delegates. Though initially reluctant, she soon decided to run; her husband served as her campaign manager and treasurer. Fain also gained the support of suffragists, including Pauline Forstall Colclough Adams, the wife of a Norfolk physician and who had become the second woman to practice law in Norfolk as well as one of 13 picketers arrested in 1917 for flaunting banners in front of President Woodrow Wilson's reviewing stand during a parade.Maura Mazurowski, Woman attorneys saluted as Part of Virginia's history, Virginia Lawyers Weekly, Vol. 34, No. 20 (October 14, 2019) p. 7 Upon her arrival in Richmond, Fain was treated as something of a novelty, but disappointed some because she focused on the maritime and education issues important to her constituents, rather than a feminist agenda (as her detractors feared). On January 8 Fain seconded the nomination of Richard L. Brewer, Jr. as Speaker of the Virginia House; she received over a minute of applause and cheers when recognized from the floor, and upon his election Fain became the delegate chosen to formally introduce Brewer to party members. She also became one of three delegates chosen to formally introduce Governor E. Lee Trinkle to the House, and also received the honor of hers being the first bill put into the hopper for the session. In 1925 Fain became the first female legislator in the Southern United States to win reelection, and she won a third term in 1927. In her last session she chaired the Committee on Schools and Colleges, of which she had been a member from her first term. During this session she served with three other women, Sallie C. Booker, Nancy Melvina Caldwell, and Helen Ruth Henderson; the latter, elected in 1927, was the daughter of her former colleague. Rather than seek a fourth term in 1929, Fain chose to run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, but she was unsuccessful. Between sessions she served as secretary, treasurer, and chief executive of her husband's furniture factory, a role which she had discharged since 1924. Federal service and later years In 1931 Fain and her husband moved to Washington, D.C., where she received a number of appointments supporting New Deal programs; she worked for the National Emergency Council, and served as the first chief of the United States Information Service, in whose creation she assisted. She held other federal positions in North Carolina and Texas before moving to San Marino, California in 1938. Fain did not run for public office again, but returned to Norfolk to support Meeta B. Meyers in 1951, when the latter ran unsuccessfully for Fain's former seat. Otherwise she remained in California until her death. The City of Norfolk would not elect another woman to the General Assembly until Evelyn Momsen Hailey in 1973. Death and legacy Fain died on July 20, 1962, survived by her husband.

He was appointed governor of Egypt in 867, and held that position until his death in the following year.  Early career  Muzahim was the son of Khaqan 'Urtuj and the brother of al-Fath ibn Khaqan, who were influential figures during the caliphates of al-Mu'tasim (r. 833‚Äì842) and al-Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861), respectively. He first appears in 862, during the reign of al-Muntasir (r. 861‚Äì862), when he was appointed as a commander of Wasif's campaign against the Byzantines.; Under al-Muntasir's successor al-Musta'in (r. 862‚Äì866), he led a Turkish army to quell a tribal uprising in Jordan after the local authorities proved incapable of defeating it themselves.; Following the outbreak of civil war in 865 between the rival caliphs al-Musta'in (in Baghdad) and al-Mu'tazz (in Samarra), Muzahim initially sided with the former and made his way from Raqqa to Baghdad, where he was received with honor. Over the next several months he participated in the defense of Baghdad and was at one point wounded when he was struck by an arrow. In the summer of 865, with the civil war still ongoing, al-Musta'in dispatched Muzahim to secure al-Kufah, which had fallen to an 'Alid rebel. Muzahim defeated the rebels and forced the 'Alid to flee; he also ordered his troops to set fire to al-Kufah after encountering resistance within the city. After reporting news of his conquest, Muzahim received a letter from al- Mu'tazz, urging him to defect from al-Musta'in's side. After discussing the proposal, Muzahim and a number of his soldiers agreed to switch allegiances, and made their way to Samarra. After the end of the civil war in 866, which resulted in al-Mu'tazz becoming sole caliph (r. 866‚Äì869), Muzahim was sent to Malatyah in the Byzantine frontier, and he reportedly went on campaign against the Byzantines.  Governorship of Egypt  In August 866, Muzahim arrived in Egypt with an army to reinforce the province's governor Yazid ibn Abdallah al- Hulwani, who had been having difficulty dealing with a number of revolts, including that of Jabir ibn al-Walid. Following Muzahim's arrival, Yazid and his lieutenants were subsequently able to make progress against the rebels, but they were unable to defeat them completely, and in 867 al-Mu'tazz dismissed Yazid as governor and appointed Muzahim instead.; Following the receipt of his appointment, Muzahim continued with the effort to pacify the province. After putting down an uprising in the Hawf of Lower Egypt, Muzahim and his chief of security (shurtah) Azjur al-Turki shifted their focus to defeating Jabir. The next several months were spent on campaign against the rebel, and the latter finally sued for peace in August 867; Muzahim, however, imprisoned him in al-Fustat, and in the following year Jabir was sent to Iraq. According to the Egyptian historian al-Kindi, during Muzahim's administration his lieutenant Azjur mandated a number of ritual practices that were previously foreign to Egypt. Women were banned from the baths and cemeteries, while actors and mourners were imprisoned and lamentations at funerals were outlawed. The call to prayer was only to be made from the rear of the mosque; worshippers at the mosque were to be set up in orderly rows and were not allowed to bring cushions. The recitation of the basmala in the mosque during prayers was forbidden, and during the month of Ramadan only five prayers were allowed, instead of the usual Egyptian custom of six.; Muzahim died in 868 after contracting an illness.

New discoveries Rai discovered the motion of venous valves in human beings i.e. its rhythmical opening and closing during each cardiac beat. This new information on venous valves comes almost 500 years after discovery by Fabricus Acquapedente of Padua University that venous valves are one way doors allowing blood to go towards the heart.Interview: The functioning of the Heart: Dr. Dinker Rai‚Äôs Discovery- Bhavan‚Äôs Journal VOL .5:9&10\\\\. February 1986 He discovered that venous blood flow is pulsatile which, prior to Rai's discovery, was described only as linear flow. He is best known for his discovery of the mechanical function of atrial chambers of the heart. With experimental evidence on the canine heart, he discovered that atrial diastole is the key force that creates a negative pressure that brings blood back to the heart. Diastole is an - active expansion of the muscle on which the cardiac return depends. This is an addition to Starling‚Äôs law of muscle contraction that muscle not only actively contracts but expands as well. This significant historic discovery was made approximately 500 years after Sir William Harvey's discovery of the mechanical function of Ventricular Systole. This discovery has opened doors for new understanding / treatment of heart failure, atrial fibrillation and in improving the design and functioning of prosthetic hearts.

She is mostly known as one of the ships captained by Robert Surcouf. In early 1795 she was renamed to √âmilie. She was then under command of young Robert Surcouf and was armed with only four 6-pounders cruising from August 1795; in January 1796, after she had captured Cartier, Surcouf transferred to his prize, leaving √âmilie in command of Jean Croizet. (more details at Robert Surcouf#Cruise of √âmilie and capture of Triton). She returned to Mauritius in March 1796 and was renamed Modeste again. In August 1796, armed with 20 guns, she cruised under Claude Deschiens, who died in battle on 10 September 1796; command passed to Jean-Marie Dutertre and she returned to Isle de France in June 1797. Dutertre went on another cruise from late 1797 or early 1798, and sailed until April 1798 (again with 20 guns). Her fate is murky: in March 1797 the 32-gun captured √âmilie near Visakhapatnam, but then in April 1798 the 32-gun also captured an √âmilie.  Career  √âmilie was originally the merchantman Lafayette, which arrived at √éle de France from Bordeaux in July 1792. In 1793, she was commissioned as a privateer corvette and conducted a campaign under Jean-Fran√ßois Malroux. In September 1793, she was renamed √éle de France and cruised until April 1794 under L√©onard-Julien Quiroard. Around May 1794, she was under Louis Levaillant, carrying the name Modeste. She notably captured the Dutch East India Company ship Hootluyce, with Joachim Drieux leading her boarding party.Gallois, vol.2, p. 361. In August 1795, Modeste passed under the command of Robert Surcouf, who renamed her √âmilie. Governor Malartic had refused to provide Surcouf a lettre de marque and ordered √âmilie to go to the Seychelles to purchase tortoises as food for √éle de France.Levot, p.494Granier, p.217Cunat, p.392 Upon arrival at Mah√©, she encountered two large British ships and fled hastily, cutting her anchor.Les corsaires de la R√©publique, Gallois Arrived a Bago, Myanmar, √âmilie encountered the British merchant Pinguin; she approached without hoisting colours and when Pinguin fired a warning shot, Surcouf took pretext of it to fire a three-shot broadside that induced Pinguin to surrender. Surcouf took supplies needed for √âmilie and sent Pinguin to Mauritius under P√©ru, one of his officers. On 19 January, √âmilie captured the pilot ship Cartier, along with two rice-loaded merchantmen she was guiding; Surcouf transferred to Cartier, which he renamed Hasard, taking all the guns off √âmilie and leaving only 23 men aboard under Jean Croizet, who returned to √éle de France with the two prizes. When she returned to √éle de France, √âmilie was renamed back to Modeste. In August 1796, she set out for another campaign under Claude Deschiens, this time armed with 20 guns. She captured Princess while Princess was at anchor in Delagoa Bay.Rhys & Du Pasquier (1989), p.246. Although Modeste captured Princess, was able to fend off Modeste.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2879. Modeste did capture Good Intent two days later. Deschiens was killed in action on 10 September. As Deschiens was preying on British whalers, two heavily armed whalers attacked Modeste. Deschiens managed to repel them but was injured in the battle and died of his wounds the next day. Jean-Marie Dutertre took command and continued the cruize. Still, Modeste returned to √éle de France within the month. The same month, she set out for another campaign under Jean-Marie Dutertre. Apparently captured Modeste near Visakhapatnam in March 1797.

The Spanish troops led by Gregorio Garc√≠a de la Cuesta were completely successful in ousting the French under Louis Pierre Fran√ßois Delattre from Collioure, Fort Saint-Elme and Port-Vendres. The contending sides were the Spanish Army of Catalonia commanded by Antonio Ricardos and the French Army of the Eastern Pyrenees led by Fran√ßois Am√©d√©e Doppet and Eustache Charles d'Aoust. In September 1793, the French successfully defended Perpignan from Spanish attack but December saw a series of French defeats. One of the French representatives on mission, Claude Dominique C√¥me Fabre was killed during the fighting at Collioure. Aoust and Delattre were arrested, condemned and executed by guillotine for the disaster. Background In the year 1793 the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees suffered from the attentions of overbearing representatives on mission. While these political agents exercised enormous powers over the military leaders, they probably abused their authority in this army more than in any other. Claude Dominique C√¥me Fabre called commanders-in-chief useless and wanted the rank done away with. His colleague Raymond Gaston declared, \\"I know neither generals nor special powers ... I alone should command here and I shall be obeyed.\\" Louis-Charles de Flers was appointed commander on 14 May 1793 and was dismissed on 6 August. Flers was arrested and executed by guillotine on 22 July 1794. Hilarion Paul Puget de Barbantane was commander from 7 August to 11 September. Terrified by the maneuvers of Spanish commander Antonio Ricardos, he abandoned his army and fled to Narbonne where he resigned his command. Though thrown in prison, Barbantane managed to escape the Reign of Terror. In the Battle of Peyrestortes on 17 September, the leaderless army scored a victory thanks to Generals Eustache Charles d'Aoust and Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet and Representative Joseph Cassanyes. On 18 September Luc Sim√©on Auguste Dagobert was appointed commander. Ricardos defeated Dagobert at the Battle of Truillas on 21 September, though the Spanish afterward retreated to the Tech River valley. After clashing with the representatives, Dagobert resigned and returned to his division in the Cerdagne. On 29 September the representatives chose Aoust as temporary commander. The new commander Louis Marie Turreau finally arrived on 11 October and was aghast at the way the representatives ordered around the generals. The representatives did not like Turreau and asked to the Minister of War to recall him. Because of a missed communication between the War Office and army headquarters, Turreau decided to allow Aoust to continue in acting command while he sat on the sidelines and wrote complaining letters to his political friends. Several unsuccessful attacks were made on the Spanish positions in October. Turreau's application for transfer finally came through and the representatives named Aoust temporary commander from 22 November. Fran√ßois Am√©d√©e Doppet assumed command of the army on 28 November. Doppet found the army in a terrible state, the men badly equipped and the horses and mules dying from lack of feed. The representatives practically ignored Doppet, issuing orders without informing him of the actions of his own units. On 6 December, Doppet received information that the Spanish planned to attack Villelongue-dels-Monts the next day and tried to warn the garrison. Paying no heed to their commander, the defenders set out to attack the Spanish. The result was a fiasco; the French were routed and the Spanish captured Villelongue. In order to break contact with the enemy and draw his army back into winter quarters, Doppet planned an attack on Villelongue. The representatives chose Aoust to lead the assault, which was launched on the evening of 18 December and was a success. Jean Lannes, Pierre Banel, Jean Joseph Guieu and Pierre Francois Sauret were involved in the fighting in which heavy losses were inflicted on the Portuguese garrison and 15 guns were seized. On 20 December, Doppet became ill in the same epidemic that would sicken or kill 10,000 soldiers. He did not recover for two and a half months and was replaced by Aoust. Battle Gregorio de la Cuesta After his success on 7 December 1793, Ricardos planned to evict the French from the coastal towns, Collioure and Port-Vendres. He sent the division of Juan de Courten to the south side of the Pyrenees at Espolla. While Jos√© de Iturrigaray and the Spanish cavalry distracted the enemy near Argel√®s-sur-Mer, Courten was ordered to attack the French position near the Col de Banyuls (Banyuls Pass). On 14 December the attack was made by six or seven columns that each crossed the Pyrenees by different passes. The attempt was a success and Delattre's troops were compelled to abandon their positions after the Spanish captured 300 French soldiers and 20 field pieces. This action forced Delattre's division into a narrow corridor along the coast. Gregorio Garc√≠a de la Cuesta replaced Courten in command a few days later. The new commander saw that Collioure could be approached by three defiles through rough terrain. Delattre deployed his men on a ridge covering both Collioure and Port-Vendres. Cuesta formed his troops into columns under Castrillo, Ortig and Solano and attacked. All three columns broke through, the French defenders fleeing in the direction of their coastal forts. As the retreating French approached Fort Saint-Elme and Port-Vendres, both places shut their gates, refusing to admit the soldiers. Fort Saint-Elme even fired on them. Feeling betrayed, large numbers of men surrendered to the pursuing Spanish troops. Saint-Elme's traitorous commander immediately surrendered the fort as soon as Solano summoned it. Ortig called for the surrender of Port-Vendres and it also capitulated. The remaining French troops sought refuge in Collioure or tried to break out by fighting their way north along the coast. Delattre escaped but Fabre was killed, dying bravely at the front of one of the columns. Cuesta sent three battalions to approach Collioure at night with torches, threatening to burn the place. It surrendered as well. The date of the battle is unclear. Two sources stated that the engagement happened on 20 December. Another authority asserted that the fighting occurred on the 21st. A final source put the date of Collioure's surrender as 23 December. Results Dominique P√©rignon The French suffered losses of 4,000 men killed, wounded or captured out of a total of 5,000. Between the army and the coastal forts the Spanish captured 100 artillery pieces. Cuesta's 8,000-man force sustained only 300 casualties. Hearing of the collapse of his left wing, Aoust ordered a retreat toward Perpignan on 21 December. The Army of Catalonia rushed in pursuit, Ricardos sending his cavalry across the Tech at Brouilla in an attempt to envelop the French from the east. Jer√≥nimo Gir√≥n-Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarillas pursued in the center with 6,000 Spanish troops while Portuguese general John Forbes with five battalions closed in menacingly from the west. In the crisis, Catherine-Dominique de P√©rignon's brigade blocked the Portuguese at Saint-Luc, causing Ricardos to hesitate and allowing the French to scramble to safety. Even so, the French lost 7,700 men and 23 guns before they reached a secure position at PerpignanThe text suggested the 7,700 included the losses at Collioure, but was not specific. and its entrenched Camp de l'Union. There were only 8,000 soldiers left with the colors. Since all the other French armies had been successful by the end of 1793, the National Convention issued a decree criticizing the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. Aoust, who became the army commander just as the disaster struck, was recalled and later executed. He went to the guillotine on 2 July 1794. Delattre was executed the same day. January 1794 brought huge changes. The new French commander Jacques Fran√ßois Dugommier came with 10,500 troops after successfully concluding the Siege of Toulon in December. Ricardos died on 13 March 1794, allegedly from a cup of poisoned chocolate. His freshly appointed replacement Alejandro O'Reilly died of a stomach ailment ten days later. Finally, Luis Firm√≠n de Carvajal, Conde de la Uni√≥n was named the new leader of the Army of Catalonia.

It was awarded the Margaret Mahy Book of the Year prize and also won the top prize in the Young Adult Fiction category at the 2013 New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards. It was briefly banned from sale and supply in New Zealand.  Plot summary  Set in New Zealand, the book tells the story of MƒÅori youth Te Arepa Santos as he moves from the East Coast to Auckland to boarding school, where he has encounters with intimacy, sex, drugs, racism and death.  Restrictions and banning  In 2013 New Zealand's Film and Literature Board of Review, or appeal from New Zealand's classification office (which had given the book an unrestricted M rating) restricted Into the River to readers aged 14 years and over. This was the first time in New Zealand's history this classification was used. Auckland Libraries applied to have this decision reconsidered in 2015. One of the reasons given for the appeal was \\"the impact that the restriction has had on the value of the book as a teaching resource, and the significance of the book as an aid to countering issues in New Zealand about bullying\\". The conservative Christian lobby group Family First appealed this decision, and applied for an interim restriction order, which was granted by the President of the Board of Review. The interim restriction order under New Zealand's Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act 1993, bans it completely from being sold or supplied in New Zealand. This was the first time a book had been subject to an interim restriction order in New Zealand in 22 years and was reported by several foreign news media. The banning of the book has led to an increase of interest in it, something that has been cited as an example of the Streisand effect, in which an attempt to oppose something leads to its wider dissemination as an unintended side-effect. On 14 October 2015, the Film and Literature Board lifted the interim ban on Into the River; ruling by a majority that while aspects of the book were offensive it did not merit an age restriction. The ruling was welcomed by libraries and bookstores. In response, Family First director Bob McCoskrie accused the board of succumbing to book industry pressure despite what he alleged was the book's \\"highly offensive and gratuitous language, adult themes and graphic sexual content.\\" In response to the interim restriction order, MP Chris Bishop proposed a member's bill which would allow partial interim restriction orders, for example, applying the restriction order only to person of a certain age. The Films, Videos, and Publications Classification (Interim Restriction Orders Classification) Amendment Bill was drawn from the ballot on 10 November 2016, and passed its third reading unanimously on 29 November 2017.

Their origins are uncertain. North of M√¢con and south of Tournus, on both banks of the Sa√¥ne, there are, on one side, the villages of Boz, Ozan, Arbigny and Sermoyer, whose inhabitants call themselves Burkins, and on the other side, the village of Uchizy, whose inhabitants go by the name of Chizerots, In contradiction to M. Reboud, M. Reinaud seems to doubt their Saracen origin: \\"In 1862 I went to Uchizy and Arbigny; several persons there told me themselves that they were of Arabian or Saracenic origin. In the midst of numerous individuals, having apparently no very distinct anthropological characters, some very black haired women differed from the inhabitants of the neighbourhood by their tall and slender figure; their elongated faces, without malar prominences, by their uniform and dark complexion, by their large eyes, long eyelashes, black, thick and arched eye- brows, by their physiognomy, melancholy, yet regular and beautiful; for one of these young Chizerotes, when the French empress passed through Macon, had been appointed, as the most beautiful girl of the whole district, to offer a bouquet to her sovereign. That type seems more Arabian than Berberic.\\"Memoirs Read Before the Anthropological Society of London, Anthropological Society of London,Tr√ºbner and Co. 1870 \\"On the border between the medi√¶val dukedom and the principality of Dombes, to-day the D√©partements of the Sa√¥ne et Loire and the Ain, is a race apart from other mankind hereabouts. In numerous little villages, notably at Boz and Huchisi (Uchizy), one may still observe the dark Saracen features of the ancients mingled with those of to-day. A monograph has recently appeared which defines these peoples as something quite unlike the other varied races now welded into the citizens of twentieth century France. Modern vogue, style, fashion, or whatever you may choose to call it, is everywhere fast changing the old picturesque costume into something of the ready-made, big-store order, but to stroll about the highways and byways in these parts and see men in baggy Turkish trousers with their coats and waistcoats tied together by strings or ribbons in place of conventional buttons, is as a whiff of the Orient, or at least a reminder of the long ago. The women dress in a distinct, but perhaps not otherwise very remarkable, manner, save that an occasional 'Turk's-Head' turban is seen, quite as Oriental as the culotte of the men. A blend of Spain, of Arabia, of Persia and of Turkey could not present a costume more droll than that of the 'Chizerots,' as these people are known.\\"Castles and Chateaux of Old Burgundy, Francis Miltoun, (M.F.

It is also used by civilian pipe bands . Toronto Scottish Regiment Presentation of Colours March Off Formal Jackets Advertisement for Highland dress depicting a variant of the double breasted Montrose Doublet. As with both uniform doublets and civilian dress, there are a number of styles of jacket or doublet suitable for wear with highland dress. Kinloch Anderson, one of the older makers of highland dress in Scotland, considers the \\"Coatee and Vest (often called the Prince Charlie Jacket), Argyll Jacket, Regulation Doublet, Montrose Doublet, Sheriffmuir Jacket or Kenmore jacket\\" suitable for \\"black tie\\" evening wear , with all except the Argyll Jacket also considered acceptable for \\"white tie\\" events. The Argyll jacket and tweed jackets are appropriate for day wear. Different tailors describe similar jackets using different names. This garment is similar to a mess jacket, with buttoned gauntlet cuffs, short or no skirts, and with or without lapels. It may have a row of silver heraldic buttons on each side. It may be worn with a lace jabot and cuff set, and a high-buttoned waistcoat. It is typically made of velvet or wool, with satin lapels, and may feature epaulettes. The highland doublet is jacobean in style and may date to that period or earlier. Variation may be called an Argyll jacket or Prince Charlie jacket (or coatee). The Regulation doublet is typically black barathea or coloured velvet with silk-faced peaked lapels, buttoned gauntlet cuffs, and epaulettes, similar to the Prince Charlie coatee, which it pre-dates. Unlike the coatee, which is cut like a mess jacket, the doublet has braided \\"tashes\\" (otherwise known as Inverness skirts/flaps) at the front and back. The Regulation doublet was at one time the regulation uniform jacket of the Highland regiments and is worn with a three-button waistcoat which may be made from the same cloth as the jacket, white piqu√©, or tartan cloth. The doublet should be worn with a black silk bow tie for black tie events, and either a white piqu√© bow tie, or a lace jabot for white tie events. The Balmoral Doublet is a single-breasted jacket traditionally made from velvet. It is usually worn with a belt and black bow tie. The Montrose Doublet (as defined by Kinloch Anderson) is \\"a double breasted short cut evening jacket with high collar. There are ten symmetrically positioned Celtic buttons on front, three Celtic buttons on each cuff and epaulettes with Celtic buttons on each shoulder\\". It is normally worn with a belt, lace jabot, and lace cuffs, and may be made from black barathea or velvet . The Kenmore doublet is a single- breasted doublet, worn buttoned up (no lapels) and without a waistcoat. It is traditionally made from velvet and is always worn with a belt, lace jabot and cuffs. It may be worn on all formal occasions. It is named after the town of Kenmore which lies at the east of Loch Tay. The Sheriffmuir doublet is a doublet with gauntlet cuffs and a stand collar with no lapels. It is typically worn open with a waistcoat, lace jabot and cuffs. Sheriffmuir lies between Dunblane and Stirling overlooking the Allan Water. In 1715 a battle was fought here between the Jacobites under the Earl of Mar and the Government forces under the Duke of Argyll.

The narrative is set in several different eras, spanning from the Biblical creation to 50,000 BC and from there to a distant future ahead of our time, and follows Adam, Eve, and Lucifer as they explore humanity and the meaning of life. Each segment has a different visual style to reflect the art of the respective time periods. The film is based on the 1861 play The Tragedy of Man by Imre Mad√°ch. The film went into production in 1988 but encountered difficulties as the production model for Hungarian cinema changed. The segments were financed individually and sometimes exhibited independently at film festivals and on Hungarian television. After 23 years in production, the finished film premiered in 2011. Plot God creates the universe. Lucifer mocks God for the shortcomings of humanity, which he predicts will soon aspire to become God. As the primaeval spirit of negation, he claims to be as old as God and demands his share of the world, which he is granted in the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Immortality. Lucifer tempts Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit. Expelled from the Garden of Eden and abandoned by God, Adam reasons that he is no longer obliged to show God any gratitude. He decides to live from his own strength alone. Lucifer offers Adam to experience his own future, and takes him from the Stone Age into the future, throughout human history. In ancient Egypt, Adam is Pharaoh Djoser in 2650 BC who falls in love with Eve in the form of a slave woman. Adam abolishes slavery, but Lucifer argues that it would be futile, as history would prove. Adam is taken to ancient Greece, where democracy has resulted in corruption and foul political play. Adam appears as Miltiades in 489 BC and is sentenced to death after the masses have been agitated against him. Disillusioned, Adam is taken to ancient Rome in 67 AD where he and Lucifer enjoy themselves with gladiator games and prostitutes. As decadence makes the civilization fall apart, Adam and Eve encounter Saint Peter and then Jesus, and turn to God, who gives them a message of love and fraternity. Adam becomes Tancred, Prince of Galilee in 1096 AD but is disgusted by the East‚ÄìWest Schism and pettiness within the church. He falls in love with Eve who is locked inside a monastery. Adam is then Johannes Kepler in Prague, 1608. He seeks eternal wisdom by studying the physical world while his wife is unfaithful. Adam becomes Georges Danton during the French Revolution in Paris, 1794. Eve appears as an aristocrat who is guillotined and as a prostitute who revels in the revolutionary terror. Danton is eventually put before the National Convention and executed for conspiring with the aristocracy. Once again in the body of Kepler, Adam wakes up from a dream. He recognizes that ideas are more powerful and long-lasting than individual men. Adam and Lucifer visit Victorian London in 1897 as unnamed Englishmen, which Adam initially finds impressive but Lucifer argues is decayed on a spiritual level, as everything has become a commodity. Adam tries to court Eve and is eventually able to seduce her, right after World War I, with the help of jewels and a Gypsy fortune teller. When social unrest erupts in the 20th century, Adam wishes for a society ruled after scientific principles for the common good. Lucifer brings Adam to a future egalitarianist world state. Although initially positive, Adam immediately regrets the disappearance of nations, as he thinks people should have a past and an identity to hold on to. Animals and plants which are not useful are extinct and the useful ones have been genetically modified. Adam questions the materialist worldview and is arrested for criminal thinking. Eve appears as a mother who is punished for refusing to let society educate her child. Adam and Lucifer travel further to a dehumanized future in space. Adam is at first unsettled, but when the spirit of Earth urges him to return, he proclaims that his spirit can live beyond the body. On the verge of annihilation, Adam changes his mind and promises to keep striving on Earth. He accepts mortality and man's struggle. In a distant ice age, the last remains of humanity are dying. The few people Adam encounters are deformed savages. Lucifer argues that they do not differ in nature from humans of any other era. Adam wakes up in his cave 50,000 BC. He joins Lucifer on a cliff, where he argues for the existence of free will, while Lucifer reminds him of the futility of human ambition. Adam argues that he can still go against God by committing suicide. As he is about to leap from the cliff, Eve finds him and tells him that she is pregnant. God urges Adam to keep having faith. Adam decides to follow God's word and accepts struggle as an end in itself.

It is based on Imre Mad√°ch's 1861 play The Tragedy of Man. The film went into production in 1988 at Pannonia Film Studio. Jankovics expected a typical animated feature to take three years to produce, but since The Tragedy of Man would have twice the running time of a typical film he expected it to take six years to make. After the fall of communism in Hungary in 1989, Jankovics could no longer rely on the state-funded system he had produced his previous films within and had to seek alternative ways to finance the project. Jankovics in 2010 The film was produced one segment at a time, after which production ceased until funding had been secured for the next segment. Just like in the original play, there is a total of 15 segments. Each of these were animated in a different visual style. Over the years, several segments were exhibited individually at film festivals and shown on the public television network Duna TV, although the majority of the material was never shown publicly until the entire film was finished. In 2008 some funding was secured when Jankovics' 1974 short film Sisyphus was used in an American car commercial which was shown at the Super Bowl. In 2011 the film received 19.5 million forint from the culture department of the Ministry of National Resources. The total cost of the film corresponded to 600 million forint (approximately two and half million U.S. Dollars) in the exchange rate at the time of the release. After 23 years in production, the last post-production work was finished in 2011. Release The film premiered on 27 November 2011 at the Anilogue International Animation Film Festival. It was released in regular Hungarian cinemas by Mozinet on 8 December 2011. The film was shown with an intermission, which made a screening last for three hours from start to finish. The film had 20,000 admissions in Hungary, of which 9,500 came from Budapest where it was screened in a single cinema. It was shown at a number of international film festivals. In June 2013 it was shown at the Facets Cin√©math√®que in Chicago. Reception Bill Stamets of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: > The animation styles vary throughout this chronology of human folly, but > this wary sermon stays on message[.] ... Lucifer the interlocutor delights > in the endless conflict between human reason and a hands-off God. Stamets continued: > To add strains of grandeur, [Jankovics] draws on works by Bach, Mussorgsky, > Respighi and Wagner. He thrills when visualizing the French Revolution as a > tri-color mob in motion. Later, twisting DNA strands are depicted nearly as > mystically. All told, The Tragedy of Man is illustrated theology.

Description The name \\"Salduro\\" is a combination of Spanish words and means hard salt. The settlement was located on the geologically- significant Salduro Salt Marsh, also known as the Bonneville Salt Flats. Bonneville Speedway is located approximately north of Salduro. History Eastbound Western Pacific Railroad passenger train crossing the Bonneville Salt Flats near Salduro (1912). Salduro formed next to the Western Pacific Railroad, which was completed in the early 1900s. Significant salt beds were identified during the construction of the railroad, and several mining claims soon followed. After several years of unprofitable attempts to produce salt, the claims were leased by the Capell Salt Company, which erected a small mill near Salduro. Interstate 80 was built at the former settlement. A plaque there commemorates the land speed records set on the Bonneville Salt Flats. (July 2014) Around 1916, the Capell Salt Company merged into (or was transferred to) the Solvay Process Company, a potash producer. That same year, the Solvay Process Company began extracting potash from subsurface brines of the Salduro Salt Marsh. The operation was constructed on the south side of the Western Pacific Railroad at Salduro station. On June 23, 1924, U.S. Army test pilot Russell Maughan performed the first dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the United States, flying a Curtiss P-1 Hawk. One of his five refueling stops was in Salduro. The settlement gained prominence in the 1930s and 40s when significant potash and salt were mined nearby. Decline In 1944, the potash plant at Salduro closed. Shortly after, fire swept through the settlement, and it was soon abandoned.

Like previous jubilees, it was seen by the Church as a period for remission of sins and universal pardon focusing particularly on God's forgiveness and mercy. It was an extraordinary Jubilee because it had not been predetermined long before; ordinary jubilees are usually celebrated every 25 years. The 2016 Jubilee was first announced by Pope Francis on 13 March 2015. It was declared in the pope's April 2015 papal bull of indiction (formal announcement or proclamation), ' (Latin for \\"The Face of Mercy\\"). It is the 27th holy year in history, following the ordinary 2000 Jubilee during John Paul II's papacy. The opening day was also the 50th anniversary of the closing of the Second Vatican Council. Francis wished for the Jubilee to be celebrated not only in Rome but all around the world; for the first time holy doors are open in single dioceses, either in the cathedral or in historical churches. The first holy door was opened by Pope Francis in Bangui on 29 November 2015, during a tour of East Africa. The Jubilee officially ended on 20 November 2016 with the closing of the Holy Door of Saint Peter's Basilica which was open since the Holy Year began the previous December.  Papal bull  The Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica, opened in 2016 The Jubilee of Mercy was formally declared through the papal bull ', issued on 11 April 2015, which emphasizes the importance of mercy and the need to 'gaze' on it; the bull also recalls the need for the Church to be more open, keeping alive the spirit of the Second Vatican Council. The holy doors of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special 'Doors of Mercy' were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world. The opening of the holy door at St. Peter's was the first time two popes were present, as Pontiff Emeritus Benedict attended at Pope Francis' invitation. The church held that by passing through these doors, the faithful can earn indulgences after fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the pope's intentions, Confession, and detachment from sin, and Communion. During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services were to be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called 'Missionaries of Mercy' were to be available in every diocese to forgive even sins normally reserved to the Holy See's Apostolic Penitentiary. In the bull, Pope Francis stated about the opening of the holy door, \\"the Holy Door will become a Door of Mercy through which anyone who enters will experience the love of God who consoles, pardons, and instils hope\\".  Concessions  It was announced that all priests (during the Jubilee yearending 20 November 2016) would be allowed in the Sacrament of Penance to remove censures for abortion, which outside North America is reserved to bishops and certain priests who are given such mandate by their bishop. By the same letter, Pope Francis also granted permission for priests of the Society of Saint Pius X to validly confer absolution, while under normal circumstances they do not possess the jurisdiction needed to confer this sacrament.  Logo and hymn  The official logo, designed by Father , shows Jesus, personification of Mercy, carrying on his shoulders a \\"lost man\\", emphasizing how deep the Savior touches humanity; his eyes are merged with those of the carried man. The background is filled by three concentric ovals, with lighter colors outwards, meaning that Jesus is carrying the man out of the darkness of sin. On one side the image is also joined by the official motto: Misericordes Sicut Pater (Merciful Like the Father), derived from Luke 6:36, which stands as an invitation to follow the example of the Father by loving and forgiving without limits. The official hymn, with most verses derived from the Gospels, First Corinthians and Psalms, was written by Eugenio Costa, S.J., with original music composed by Paul Inwood.  Main events  The following main events and days of celebration for specific categories of the faithful were scheduled: The Holy Door of the Cathedral in Burgos, Spain, for the Holy Year of Mercy, 2015‚Äì16 * 29 November 2015: opening of a holy door in Bangui's Notre-Dame Cathedral * 8 December 2015: opening of the holy door in St. Peter's Basilica * 13 December 2015: opening of the holy door in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, and in many cathedrals around the world * 1 January 2016: opening of the holy door in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore * 19‚Äì21 January 2016: Jubilee for the pilgrims * 2 February 2016: Jubilee for consecrated lives, closing of the \\"Year for Consecrated Life\\" * 22 February 2016: Jubilee for the Roman Curia * 4‚Äì5 March 2016: penitential liturgy and call for \\"24 Hours for the Lord\\" * 20 March 2016: Palm Sunday * 3 April 2016: Jubilee for all those who find themselves in the spirituality of mercy * 24 April 2016: Jubilee for newly confirmed aged 13‚Äì16 (to older young people is dedicated the World Youth Day in July) * 27‚Äì29 May 2016: Jubilee for deacons * 3 June 2016: Jubilee for priests * 12 June 2016: Jubilee for diseased people and those who assist them * 26‚Äì31 July 2016: Jubilee for young people and World Youth Day 2016 in Krak√≥w, Poland * 4 September 2016: Jubilee for volunteers * 25 September 2016: Jubilee for catechists * 8‚Äì9 October 2016: Marian Jubilee * 6 November 2016: Jubilee for prisoners; some prisoners were to attend celebrations in St. Peter's Basilica * 11‚Äì13 November 2016: Jubilee for the Socially Excluded * 13 November 2016: Jubilee for the Socially Marginalized in St. Peter's Basilica; closing of holy doors everywhere except St. Peter's Basilica * 20 November 2016: closing of the holy door in St. Peter's Basilica Misericordia et misera Misericordia et misera is an Apostolic letter authored by Pope Francis and scheduled for release on 21 November 2016 following the conclusion of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy. He signed it in a public ceremony on 20 November and presented copies to representatives chosen to represent the universal audience for his message: Philippine cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of Manila, Scottish archbishop Leo Cushley, two missionary priests from Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a Roman deacon and his family, two women religious from South Korea and Mexico, three generations of a U.S. family, an engaged couple, religious instructors, and two people representing the disabled and the sick. The title of the document references Saint Augustine's commentary on Jesus and the woman taken in adultery in the Gospel of John. After Jesus challenges her accusers and they withdraw, Augustine says that only misera et misericordia (misery and mercy) remain. Pope Francis reverses the two terms Augustine used. The document was released at a press conference hosted by Rino Fisichella, President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.  Media responses  Art historian Ralf van B√ºhren said that the Jubilee was an excellent opportunity for cultural and arts journalism, because mercy has been an important subject of Christian iconography. Since the Middle Ages, many representations in art encouraged people to practice the works of mercy and helped \\"the audience to explore mercy in their own lives\\",B√ºhren, Ralf van. Caravaggio‚Äôs ‚ÄòSeven Works of Mercy‚Äô in Naples. The relevance of art history to cultural journalism. Church, Communication and Culture 2 (2017), pp. 63-87, quotation from pp. 79-80. as B√ºhren explains using the example of Caravaggio's painting in Naples. He felt that in this way the Jubilee Year of Mercy \\"issued a call to journalists, multimedia experts and social media communicators to report on facts, people, ideas and evangelization by using Christian art to explore benevolence, pardon, and mercy\\".B√ºhren 2017, p. 80.

Founded in 1890 as an association of cyclists, the Sport V√©locip√©dique Mon√©gasque, the club began to incorporate motorists in 1907 and was renamed the Sport V√©locip√©dique et Automobile Mon√©gasque.

The rally would start at points across Europe, and converge on Monaco to finish. The club ceased to organise cycling events following the First World War and was renamed the Automobile Club de Monaco in 1925. The ACM applied to the AIACR (the forerunner to the FIA) to be upgraded from a regional French club to a full national member, but had their application refused because no motorsport event was held entirely within Monaco's borders.Hughes, M. 2007.

The Monaco Grand Prix was part of the European Championship in the 1930s, and was included in the inaugural Formula One World Championship in 1950. The Grand Prix has been held continuously since 1955, and despite minor modifications over the years, it is still largely run over the same circuit as the inaugural race in 1929.

It was McDonald's first published novel. The plot takes place on a far future Mars in a town that develops around an oasis in the terraformed Martian desert. McDonald published a sequel, Ares Express, in 2001. Plot In the future, scientist Dr. Alimantando is trekking across the desert of a terraformed Mars and meets a humanoid \\"greenperson\\", who claims to have traveled through time to make sure Alimantando is in the right place at the right time to fulfill his destiny. It comes in the form of a 700-year-old sentient ROTECH environmental engineering module, or orph, which lies dying in the desert. It bequeaths itself and its resources to Dr. Alimantando, who dismantles the machine and uses its components to build his own oasis in the desert, which he names Desolation Road (instead of Destination Road) after consuming too much wine. Over time, several people find themselves at this settlement in the middle of nowhere, and are welcomed by Dr. Alimantando. Crime lord Jameson Jericho, Pasternoster of the Exalted Families, flees the violent destruction of his empire by his enemies, pursued by assassins and possessing a chip in his brain containing the consciousnesses of his Exalted Ancestors. Would-be pioneers Rael and Eva Mandella, and Rael's father Haran, arrive ahead of a sandstorm, and Eva gives birth to twins Limaal and Taasmin. Rajandra Das, a man with the power to charm machinery, is unceremoniously kicked off a train at a random stop that turns out to be Desolation Road. Industrial chemist Mikal Margolis and his put-upon mother, \\"the Babooshka\\" disembark another train and are stranded. The beautiful pilot Persis Tatterdemalion crash lands her plane near the town and, unable to repair the aircraft, stays. She and Mikal begin a relationship and open the Bethlehem Ares Railroad/Hotel. Identical lothario triplets Ed, Louie, and Umberto Gallacelli arrive at the B.A.R./Hotel having fled their raucous past. A mechanic, a lawyer, and a farmer respectively, they all simultaneously fall in love with Persis at first sight. Mikal, meanwhile, has become infatuated with Marya Quinsana, a veterinarian, whose dentist brother Morton is himself both infatuated with and fiercely possessive of his sister. The feuding Stalin and Tenebrae families arrive, and are given homesteads right next to each other. Mr. and Mrs. Stalin's unpleasant son Johnny is both befriended and abused by the Mandella twins. Meredith Blue Mountain and his daughter Ruthie, whom he secretly created in a genesis-bottle, come to town to avoid persecution by their former neighbors. Ruthie has the power to absorb the beauty around her, and release it outward at will. Haran Mandella marries the Babooshka, who despite her advanced age is desperate for another child. She commissions an artificial womb to carry their baby, but soon Genevieve Tenebrae, denied a child by her husband Gaston, steals the fetus and has Marya implant it in her. Nine months later, Genevieve gives birth to a daughter she names Arnie, while the artificial womb produces nothing; Hasan realizes what has occurred but cannot prove it. Rajandra Das speaks to a captive angel in a travelling show, and aids in its escape. Dominic Frontera, a representative from ROTECH's planetary maintenance division, arrives to inform the inhabitants of Desolation Road that their settlement will soon be destroyed thanks to an incoming ice comet. Part of the overall terraforming initiative and intended to add needed moisture into the atmosphere, the comet's trajectory was set with no knowledge of the town's existence, and cannot be stopped. Dr. Alimantando is desperate to complete his long-gestating formula for time travel to save the town, and the greenperson appears unexpectedly to provide the final calculations. Dr. Alimantando vanishes back in time to register Desolation Road as a town, effectively negating the threat of the comet, though the residents dream of the alternate timeline. Persis marries all three Gallacelli brothers, eventually having twins named Sevriano and Batisto. Reception Cory Doctorow called Desolation Road \\"one of my most personally influential novels\\", describing it as \\"an epic tale of the terraforming of Mars, whose sweep captures the birth and death of mythologies, economics, art, revolution, politics.\\" Doctorow also compared the novel to Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy (1992‚Äì1996), and noted that it pays homage to the David Byrne album The Catherine Wheel as well as the works of Ray Bradbury and Jack Vance. He wrote of Desolation Road, \\"Spanning centuries, the book includes transcendent math, alternate realities, corporate dystopias, travelling carnivals, post-singularity godlike AIs, geoengineering, and mechanical hobos, each integral to the plot.\\" Sequel McDonald published a sequel, Ares Express, in 2001.

Some sources give her first name as Leila, but her obituary, grave marker, and other sources give her name as Lelia. She is sometimes known as Mrs. Charles H. Morris, as (Mrs.) C. H. Morris, or as (Mrs.) C. H. M., having adopted her husband's forenames upon marriage after the custom of the time. Morris was born in Pennsville, Ohio. While still a child, she moved with her family to Malta, OH. Later, she and her sister and her mother ran a millinery shop in McConnelsville, OH. In 1881, she married Charles H. Morris. The couple were active in the Methodist Episcopal Church, and attended camp meetings at places such as Old Camp Sychar, Mount Vernon, OH and Sebring Camp, Sebring, OH. In the 1890s, she began to write hymns and gospel songs; it has been said that she wrote more than 1,000 songs and tunes, and that she did so while doing her housework.

He was convicted of embezzling 160 million yuan of public funds and received a death sentence with reprieve in 2006, later commuted to life in prison. At the time of his conviction, it was the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the People's Liberation Army. Life and career Wang Shouye was born in 1943 to a peasant family in Li Village, Dengli Township, Ye County, Henan Province. An excellent student, he achieved the sixth highest score in Henan Province in the 1964 Gaokao and was admitted to Tianjin University, where he majored in civil engineering. In 1968, Wang was recruited into the PLA's 38th Group Army based in Baoding, and served as a military engineer. His high educational background and technical ability distinguished him from other soldiers, and he steadily rose through the ranks. He was later transferred to the PLA General Logistics Department (GLD), where he was repeatedly promoted, and appointed Head of the GLD Division of Infrastructure and Barracks in December 1995. In July 1994 he attained the rank of major general. In July 2001, he was transferred to the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to serve as a deputy commander. A year later, he was promoted to the rank of vice admiral (zhong jiang). He was ranked second among the five deputy commanders of the PLAN. Corruption scandal Wang Shouye was scheduled to retire in June 2006, but in December 2005, he was suspected of corruption and placed under shuanggui by the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Military Commission. In April 2006, he was court-martialled and convicted of embezzling 160 million yuan of public funds. He was sentenced to death with reprieve, which was later commuted to life imprisonment. At the time of his conviction, it was the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the People's Liberation Army. Wang embezzled most of the funds between 1997 and 2001, when he was in charge of infrastructure and construction of barracks at the GLD. Although his final position as deputy navy commander was higher ranking, it was far less lucrative than the GLD position, which controlled enormous amounts of construction funds. Investigators who searched his homes in Beijing and Nanjing found US$2.5 million stashed in a washing machine and 52 million yuan of cash in refrigerators and microwaves. He also had more than 50 million yuan held in bank accounts. Wang Shouye reportedly kept at least five mistresses, mostly from the military performance troupe. His most serious and long-term mistress was a military actress surnamed Jiang, who gave birth to a son. Jiang asked Wang to either marry her or break up with her. Wang could not marry her but wanted custody of their son, and Jiang requested a payment of five million yuan. After several years of fruitless bargaining over the payment, Jiang reported Wang's embezzlement to the leaders of the Central Military Commission, resulting in the investigation that led to his conviction. Patronage In an article published in the liberal journal Yanhuang Chunqiu, retired Major General Zhang Jinchang suggested that Wang's promotion in the military was owing to the patronage of General Jia Ting'an, who is also a native of Ye County. Zhang stated that General Hong Xuezhi opposed Wang's promotion to deputy Navy commander for his lack of experience in the Navy. Wang may have also gained President Jiang Zemin's favour for building the grandiose new headquarters of the Central Military Commission.

They are mostly located in the north-center of Venezuela, concentrated in Caracas and Valencia. History =First generation= Apparently one of the first Greeks to arrive in the country was \\"Juan El Griego\\" to Margarita Island, and \\"Kalimios\\" in 1922, who founded the company of \\"Ferry-Boats\\" in Maracaibo Lake. Most of the Greeks that are still living in the country came in 1948, from Greece and other close countries, immediately after the end of World War II, due to the prevailing conditions of poverty and unemployment in Europe. Most were of Greek origin, born in Greece or in neighboring countries, but of Greek parents or grandparents. The group of about 160 who come to Venezuela in that year, about 30 were from Romania, between 30 and 40 from Germany and the rest from Greece. Apparently then come some other Greeks, who had initially arrived in other countries of America. Greeks from Romania, who also speak Romanian as second language, and Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians inside Greek population became adjusted to Venezuela society because of the linguistic similarities between Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Spanish, as well as Latin identity of Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians. Later between 1955 and 1957 arrived about 2,000 Greeks more. After these groups, immigration decreased, and since 1960 the majority of those who came do so for family reunification. These Greeks came to the country primarily for economic reasons, attracted by newscasts, written advertisements and films in which they talked about Venezuela, oil and the need for immigrants to agricultural and industrial activities. Most of the arrivals in 1948 and 1955-1957 remained in Caracas. Those who settled across the country did it basically in Miranda, Lara, Zulia, Aragua and Carabobo state. The first generation mostly learned the Spanish language by talking to people on the street because they had to work for a living. They established \\"meeting points\\" to practice their language and exchange with the peasants. So the Greek Association of Venezuela emerged on Avenida Libertador in 1954, Fanis Karaindros' Greek Caf√© in the Plaza de San Jacinto from 1956 to 1961, and the Greek Orthodox Community in North Florida district in 1961. Other ways to preserve their language and culture were the creation of the Greek School (1967-1968) and the publication of newspapers, this last is carried out almost entirely by Nicholas Palamidis. The newspapers were: News Greek (Noticias Griegas) (1961-1964), Press Greek (Prensa Griega) (1964-1966), Greek Voice (Voz Griega) (1966-1968), Free Satire (S√°tira Libre) (1967-?), Greek Light (Luz Griega) (published jointly by the Greek Orthodox Community, 1968-1979) and the newspaper Democracy (co-published by the Venezuelan Antidictatorial Committee of Greeks, 1968-?). To practice their religion asked the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America to assign them a representative, which achieved in 1956 and built a small chapel in 1961, which runs until the start of construction of the current Byzantine Cathedral (opened in February 1992 ). Most of this generation had only primary education, few knew a skilled job, so they set out to be street vendors, artisans or skilled workers. A few, after some years, collected some capital and established small industries. Currently, most of them are traders which own businesses or small industries. =Second generation= Few members of the second generation of Greek Venezuelans dominate perfectly Greek language. They learned Spanish language in Venezuelan schools and in daily contact with friends, neighbors and business of their parents. The Greek language is only practiced it at home, meeting places to which they were with their parents, in the Church and in the Greek school where many of them came on Saturdays. They are still Orthodox. Religion is passed through oral tradition and family daily contact through the calendar of festivals in the community -which is largely religious- and classes taught at the Greek school. Both generations helped build chapels and churches in several cities: Maracaibo, Barquisimeto, Valencia, Valles del Tuy conurbation. In Caracas for three decades, they dedicated to raise money for the construction of the first Latin American Byzantine Cathedral opened on 23 February 1992. In 1957 for the first time, a melkite pope of the Society of the Missionaries of St. Paul, Gabriel Dick, took pastoral care of the Greek community in the country. The Apostolic Exarchate of Venezuela was erected on 19 February 1990 with the Papal Bull Quo longius of Pope John Paul II Population In the 1950 Census for the first time are recorded as living in the country 496 Greeks, this number increased to 1566 in 1961, then 1684 in 1971 and decrease to 1453 in 81. Nowadays the number of Greece-born residents are around 3000. Festivities List of the typical Greek holidays the Greek community tend to celebrate in Venezuela: * 1 January: Saint Basil or New Year * 6 January: Theofania or Baptism of Jesus Christ * 7 January: St. John the Baptist - Carnival * 25 March: Independence Day and The Annunciation * Easter: (Responds to the lunar calendar): The most important dates are Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday or \\"Anastasis\\", which are the most important religious celebrations all year and is celebrated with great joy.

He was placed on the injured reserve list in October after tearing knee ligaments in a game against the Miami Dolphins. Simons played in 6 games for the Chiefs during the regular season in 1976, starting all 6. In 1977, he played in all 16 games for the Chiefs, again starting 6. The Chiefs traded him to the New Orleans Saints before the 1978 season but the Saints cut him before the season started.

Therefore, it is essential for the formation of tri- and tetra-antennary sugar chains. Furthermore, it is involved in glucose transport by mediating SLC2A2/GLUT2 glycosylation with controlling cell-surface expression of SLC2A2 in pancreatic beta cells and, as it is suggested, in regulating the availability of serum glycoproteins, oncogenesis, and differentiation.  Cloning and expression  In humans the enzyme is encoded by the MGAT4A gene. The related cDNA was first isolated by Yoshida and others. Equipped with three potential N-glycosylation sites and a length of 535 amino acids the structure of the MGAT4A gene product is similar to other known Golgi glycosyltransferases. The amino acid sequence of humans and of bovines are identical to 95%. Up to now MGAT4A was found in all human tissues and cell lines tested, whether they are normal tissues or cancer cell lines. The expression levels of MGAT4A relative to one another are similar among all tissues, but the expression levels of the correlating mRNA are quite different: Of the normal tissues, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocyte, lymph node, prostate, pancreas, and small intestine showed the highest mRNA level; of the cancer cell lines the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and the lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-4 exhibited the highest expression.  Animal studies  It has been proposed that the MGAT4A isoenzyme acts as a toggle for developing of type 2 diabetes. Mice that lack MGAT4A are hyperglycemic and hypoinsulinemic and have impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, MGAT4A normally protects mice from developing diabetes but is suppressed by high-fat diet.

This technology has been created in Japan. Dr. Tsushida and his collaborators at the former MAFF National Research Institute of Tea (currently the National Institute of Vegetables and Tea Science) began developing GABA-rich tea in 1984 and successfully produced a new type tea in which almost all glutamic acid has been converted to GABA without changing the content of catechin or caffeine. They discovered a new method of tea fermentation, and found that a large amount of GABA accumulated in green tea through six to ten hours in anaerobic (oxygen-free) condition of fermentation. Oxygen in the atmosphere fermentation chamber was replaced with nitrogen. They examined further the GABA content of green, oolong and black tea made under anaerobic condition and found that GABA accumulated in all teas. Japanese scientists have shown great interest and attention to this new technology and in the late 1980s in Japan, this GABA tea was actively distributed as a commercial product for people with hypertension.

He works predominantly in the pharmaceutical industry as the founder of Fuisz Pharma LLC. As of October 2015, he is named on 32 medical patents. He has been involved in the development of drug delivery and the approval of new drugs and low emission tobacco products. Joseph Fuisz is a named inventor of the formulation of the drug, Suboxone. The sales of Suboxone in 2013 were reported to be $1.2 billion in the United States. Early life and education Joseph Fuisz is the son of Richard Fuisz and Patricia Fuisz. He graduated from Yale University and Columbia Law School. Career Joseph Fuisz began his career in law, after graduating from Columbia University Law School. He passed the New York Bar exam and began practising law at Sullivan & Cromwell. He subsequently moved into medical patents, a field his father Richard Fuisz had worked in for a number of years. In 2000, Joseph Fuisz and Richard Fuisz founded International Fluidics, which was rebranded as Kosmos Pharma Limited two years later. Richard began as the more senior figure in the company, before the sale of the company in 2004. The rebranding came at a time when the company filed a number of patents that successfully allow highly sensitive proteins to be taken orally. One example of this came in 2002, the company successfully developed stamp-size medicine strips that could dissolve quickly in a patient's mouth. Kosmos Pharma Limited was acquired by MonoSol LLC in 2004, with Joseph Fuisz becoming MonoSol's Senior Vice President. Joseph Fuisz eventually moved back to Fuisz LLC, concentrating on drug delivery patents. Joseph Fuisz is also a named inventor in the Orange Book for the drug, Suboxone. It is a formulation of the Buprenorphine and is used for the treatment of opioid addiction in higher dosages, and to control pain lower doses, with dosage depending on the severity. The drug is also used for the treatment of heroin addiction, and since 2014 has been valued at over $1 billion in sales annually by its provider, Indivior. MonoSol Rx announced they had acquired a patent from Joseph Fuisz in 2012. The patent was related to drug delivery and the use of film single layer multifunctional films. The medical patent provides for a non-uniform distribution of components. The thickness direction of a layer of biocompatible film, which allows for a multifunctional film to be used in a traditional single layer. While working in the medical drug delivery market, Joseph Fuisz founded Fuisz Tobacco, which was a subsidiary of Fuisz Inc. He became the Managing Director of the company in 2008. Fuisz Tobacco developed a dissolving tobacco film strip. Joseph Fuisz claimed improved nicotine absorption from tobacco in this format. The patent for this system is assigned to Philip Morris International. Joseph Fuisz's next major advancement in tobacco came in September 2013, when he patented a delivery mechanism that used a coating. The coating, allowed for an increase in the local pH within the body, which led to maximised nicotine absorption. Joseph Fuisz has developed new tablet shapes that allow for improved esophageal transit. The US Patent Office issued a patent for this work in 2015. In 2014, Joseph Fuisz and a blood-testing patent he filed were involved in a dispute with another medical research company. Theranos accused Joseph Fuisz and his father Richard Fuisz of stealing documents of a patent they were to file. A parallel case against McDermott, Will & Emery was dismissed by a judge in late 2014, stating there was no evidence of theft. Joseph Fuisz represented himself pro se in the Theranos case. The litigation story between Fuisz and Theranos and David Boies is discussed at length in the book Bad Blood by John Carreyrou. In Bad Blood, author John Carreyrou concludes there was no evidence of theft by the Fuiszes. Fuisz discussed this litigation with various media outlets, including ABC‚Äôs podcast series, The Drop Out. Fuisz also provided an interview with TRT World in which he describes his role together with Richard Fuisz in exposing the Theranos fraud. In recent years, Fuisz has obtained new drug delivery patents related to new methods of manufacturing thin films for Thin-film drug delivery. In 2020, Joseph Fuisz announced a new venture, Nova thin Films, based on patents obtained by Richard Fuisz and Joseph Fuisz to make pharmaceutical films by deposit. Joseph Fuisz recently announced the issuance of patents related to heat not burn tobacco compositions. As of 2020, Mr. Fuisz is a named inventor on approximately forty US patents.

According to √Üthelweard's Chronicon he was a co-king of Northumbria along with his brothers Eowils and Halfdan, though the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention him. By √Üthelweard's account he died at the Battle of Tettenhall alongside his brothers in 910. Biography Following the Viking victory at the Battle of the Holme in 902 and the defeat of √Üthelwold's Revolt the three brothers Eowils, Halfdan, and Ingwaer were among the claimants to Viking Northumbria, and were able to successfully establish their rule. The population of the Danelaw was boosted in 902 by the arrival of the Vikings of Dublin who were ejected from the city that year. Throughout the first decade of the tenth century the Viking kings of Northumbria, and the Viking king of East Anglia, carried out raids on Anglo-Saxon lands to test the resolve of Edward the Elder, the new king of Wessex. In 910 the three co-kings marched an army south and attacked Wessex. They were driven back by the Anglo- Saxons, and were pursued until Edward's forces caught up with them at Tettenhall on the fifth of August. In the ensuing battle Eowils, Halfdan and Ingw√¶r were killed.Logan, pp. 42‚Äì44 ; Higham & Hill, p. 190 Identity The identity of Ingw√¶r and his brothers, and the nature of their rule, is subject to some debate. No coins bearing their names are known and it is possible they each ruled different parts of Northumbria, or even that they were simply commanders in the Viking army rather than kings, and their identification as such by contemporary sources is erroneous.Rollason, p. 217; Higham & Hill, p. 190 Ingw√¶r is known to history through √Üthelweard's Latin version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; in the extant Old English manuscripts he does not appear, only his brothers Eowils and Halfdan. The names of the three brothers are equivalent to the names of √çmar, Auisle, and Halfdan Ragnarsson, three Vikings active in the British Isles in the ninth century who may have been brothers. David Dumville has suggested this similarity could indicate Ingw√¶r, Eowils and Halfdan are from the same family as the earlier trio, the U√≠ √çmair.Dumville, pp. 88‚Äì89 According to Clare Downham, \\"the coincidence is perhaps too striking to be ignored\\".

Born in the city of Aarau, she spent her childhood in Rapperswil and as an adult made Rapperswil again her home.  Early life and education  Kinderhochzeit am Ganges (child marriage on the Ganges River), pastel Martha Burkhardt's family moved to Rapperswil in 1880, where her grandparents operated a business at Fischmarktstrasse 6 and where she spent her childhood. A year later, Martha and her younger brother Max lost her father and her grandfather and grew up in her mother's and grandmother household. The siblings were artistically gifted, and Max became a decorative painter and later a photographer in Arbon. The rebellious young woman ignored repeatedly the social limits which were imposed to women at the beginning of the 20th century, among others \\"she was the first woman in Rapperswil who boarded a bike, to the horror of frightened minds\\". Like her brother, Martha was interested in painting. Aged about 15, she worked as a domestic helper in Lausanne to spend the so-called Welschlandjahr which at that time usually teenage women absolved in western Switzerland (Welschland) to improve the knowledge of the French language. There, a teacher noticed Martha's artistic talent, but the federal art academy only allowed boys to study. Her first experiences as a painter were in Paris, France, from 1898. She then studied from 1901 to 1906 in M√ºnchen, Germany, as student of the professors Jankk and Feldbusch. At the school of artists in M√ºnchen she met her future girlfriend Meta Kirchner.Information boards on occasion of the 2015 exhibition Der Zeit voraus ‚Äì Drei Frauen auf eigenen Wegen, Stadtmuseum Rapperswil-Jona.  Voyages and work  Back in Switzerland, Martha Burkhardt established in Rapperswil her own atelier to work independently as a painter and to participate exhibitions. She succeeded, and the proceeds from the sale of her paintings allowed her, every year for a few weeks, to go on the road, among others to Italy, Scandinavia and Morocco, and also extensive trips to France, Spain, Russia and even to Constantinople. She also undertook landscape studies in the Netherlands and in Sweden. From Meta Kirchner, she received an invitation to the coronation of King George V on occasion of the Delhi Durbar of 1911, from where she traveled extensively through Asia from 1911 to 1914, although few tourists were in those years without male accompaniment. Deeply impressed by the Asian spirituality, she processed her impressions of India, China and Japan in her pictures and wrote newspaper articles and books which she illustrated herself. Back in Rapperswil, the artist took part in public life. During World War I she was engaged in the food commission of the city, and founded an emergency hospital during the 1918 flu pandemic. Then she was for many years president of the family welfare in the public women's association. Martha Burkhardt established the free child care of the charitable women's association and founded the first exchange for adopted children in Rapperswil. In 1927 she retired to her self-built house on the Meienberg hill between Rapperswil and Jona.

Gameplay Screenshot from Memory of a Broken Dimension's world Memory of a Broken Dimension begins with a command prompt interface called RELICS through which the player must navigate to reach the game world. Once inside the first- person perspective 3D game, the player will find themselves in black and white, distorted and static-filled areas. The player must move around shattered objects until their perspective shows them as a single object, at which point they can lock them in place as that object. Development Ezra Hanson-White began development on the game in 2011, spending the first couple of years experimenting and learning and primarily working on the game at night. In 2014 he quit his job and began work on the game full-time. The game originally started with the player as a person in their apartment who would sit down at their computer to start the game, but this was removed in favour of the player themselves feeling like they're discovering something. Hanson- White considers the mystery and difficulty of playing old, particularly DOS, games as inspiration for Memory of a Broken Dimension and the artistic style is partly inspired by video artifacts when streaming videos on a poor internet connection as well as space exploration and archaeology. He says that while working as a level designer on games made at large companies he grew frustrated at the simple linear areas he was creating, and wanted to experiment with game worlds with no objectives or guidance. Hanson-White continues to stream some of the game's development online. Reception In 2015 Memory of a Broken Dimension was a finalist at the Independent Games Festival in the Excellence in the Visual Arts category.
