Samoa debuted internationally at the Arafura Games in 1999, where the team won the Bronze medal. Between 1999 and 2002, Samoa played the occasional test match against other countries, most of them with loose eligibility rules, allowing Melbourne based Samoan players to participate. Samoa competed against Nauru in 2001 during Nauru's tour of Australia. Among the Samoan representatives was a young Aaron Edwards. Samoa sent a team to the inaugural 2002 Australian Football International Cup. The International Cup nation team was nicknamed the \\"Bulldogs\\" and wore the colours of the Western Bulldogs (who had donated the jumpers) which happen to be the same colours as the Flag of Samoa. Samoa finished 7th overall in the cup. In 2004, Samoa fielded a side in the Australian Football Multicultural Cup and made it all the way through to the Grand Final, but were solidly defeated by Israel. A much improved Samoa attended the 2005 International Cup, finishing in 5th position overall. Samoan players Fia Tootoo and Mateta Kirisome were selected in the International Cup All-Star team. Among the Samoan squad were future rugby internationals Mikaele Pesamino and Rambo Tavana. The team appeared at the 2008 International Cup, but their nickname was changed to the \\"Kangaroos\\" and they now wear a similar strip to the North Melbourne Football Club. The affiliation with the Kangaroos came through the rise of Aaron Edwards in AFL's ranks, becoming a power forward and taking one of the best marks of the year for the Kangaroos in the 2007 AFL Finals Series. The Samoan-born North Melbourne star attended most of the games involving Samoa in person during the 2008 cup, although he was not allowed to represent Samoa under the AFL International Cup criteria. While Samoa began the cup with a strong win over India, Samoa's 2008 cup hopes were dashed after a drubbing at the hands of the Japan Samurai before being solidly defeated by the New Zealand Falcons.

The Executive Committee of the National Security Council (commonly referred to as simply the Executive Committee or ExComm) was a body of United States government officials that convened to advise President John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. It was composed of the regular members of the National Security Council, along with other men whose advice the President deemed useful during the crisis. EXCOMM was formally established by National Security Action Memorandum 196 on October 22, 1962. It was made up of twelve full members in addition to the president. Advisers frequently sat in on the meetings, which were held in the Cabinet Room of the White House's West Wing and secretly recorded by tape machines activated by Kennedy. None of the other committee members knew the meetings were being recorded, save probably the president's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.Welch, David A., and James Blight. ‚ÄúThe Eleventh Hour of the Cuban Missile Crisis: An Introduction to the ExComm Transcripts.‚Äù International Security 12.3 (1987-1988): 5-29. Declassifying the tapes The original tape recordings of EXCOMM's meetings are currently held at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Dorchester, Boston. Great strides have been made in declassifying and publishing the tapes.McKeown, Timothy J. \\"The Cuban Missile Crisis and Politics as Usual\\". The Journal of Politics 62.1 (2000): 70-87. Excerpts from the first meeting, which took place on October 16, 1962, document the reactions of the committee members upon initially hearing the news that medium and long-range ballistic missiles might be stationed in Cuba. In the summer of 1985, McGeorge Bundy, who served as EXCOMM's Special Assistant for National Security, transcribed the tapes from the October 27, 1962 meeting. James G. Blight, while Executive Director of the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, edited and annotated Bundy's transcriptions. Authorities in Washington and at the library granted Bundy access to the tape recordings given his role with EXCOMM.Welch, David A., and James Blight. 5-29. Bundy considered the October 27 meeting especially important, as it was the meeting which immediately preceded EXCOMM's resolution of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Bundy believed the tape recordings included important historical information that should be shared with the public; notably, how political decisions are carried out when involving matters pertaining to nuclear weaponry. In the mid-1990s, the audio tapes were systematically declassified (with a modest number of excisions) and released, first as published transcriptsMay, Ernest R., and Philip D. Zelikow, Eds. (1997).

Irving Janis argued that they were relatively free of the \\"groupthink\\" that plagued discussions leading up to the Bay of Pigs. Allison and Zelikow make frequent reference to them in the second edition of Essence of Decision, in connection with the \\"bureaucratic politics\\" perspective.Allison, Graham and Philip Zelikow (1999). Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis. New York: Addison Wesley Longman. . One political theorist, James Blight, has analyzed the behavior of EXCOMM's members in the midst of the impending crisis with the Soviet Union. He suggests that the thought of war with the Soviet Union instilled a sense of fear in the committee members so that their deliberations became more productive as they reacted to this emotion.Blight, James. The Shattered Crystal Ball: Fear and Learning in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Savage, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 1990. Blight argues that EXCOMM's focus of attention shifted: as the possibility of war with the Soviet Union became more probable, the committee members became less concerned with removing the missiles from Cuba and instead focused their energy on avoiding a nuclear war. Sociologist David Gibson has explored the EXCOMM's deliberations from a discourse- analytic, or conversation-analytic, perspective. He argues that inasmuch as Kennedy's decisions were shaped by the ExComm's deliberations, they hinged on the group not talking about the dangers that awaited around every corner‚Äîsuch as the danger that the U.S. would have to bomb operational nuclear missiles were the blockade to fail to force Khrushchev to remove the missiles.Gibson, David R.

Paramount radically reduced the production budget during its third season.Herbert Solow and Robert H.

It first aired on December 11, 1997.\\"The Apology\\" - TV.com It is well known for the appearance of James Spader as Jason 'Stanky' Hanky. Plot =Jerry= Jerry begins dating Melissa (Kathleen McClellan), a woman who is comfortable being naked in his apartment in nonsexual contexts. She walks naked into the kitchen to eat waffles and is also naked while playing board games. While George is envious, Jerry soon grows uncomfortable with Melissa's quirk. He finds her unattractive when she does anything naked that involves her muscles contracting. Eventually, Jerry tries casual nudity himself, but Melissa does not support male nudity (\\"bad naked\\"). Elaine later explains that the female body is art while the male body is just utility. Ultimately Jerry convinces Melissa to wear clothes more often, but regrets his decision when he cannot stop thinking about how good she looks naked. Unfortunately Melissa cannot stop thinking of how bad Jerry looks naked, and the relationship is ruined. =George= George learns that Jason Hanky (James Spader), a childhood friend of his nicknamed \\"Stanky Hanky\\", is a recovering alcoholic and, as part of Step 9 of the Alcoholics Anonymous's Twelve Steps, is apologizing for all his old misdeeds. George gets angry when he does not receive an apology from Jason for having insulted him at a party a few years earlier by refusing to give George a sweater for fear it would be stretched out by George's \\"large\\" head. But Jason refuses to apologize, saying that the largeness of George's large head is a fact, and that the sweater was expensive. : Hanky: No way, you would've completely stretched it out. George: You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine. Hanky: All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater. Jerry points out that George now wants \\"an apology for the apology, plus the original apology\\", which George confirms (\\"I'm two in the hole!\\"). This enrages him so much that he is brought by one of Jason's sponsors to an anger management class, only to enrage him even more. Later, Jason goes to the anger management class after snapping at George and some teenagers at his job at an ice cream shop. George arrives and claims that he's a \\"step-skipper\\"; Jason counters by explaining that George's neck \\"and the melon sitting on top\\" would've stretched his sweater and that he wouldn't trust him with a V-neck. Infuriated and humiliated, George shouts, \\"He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'M LOSIN' IT!!\\" =Kramer and Elaine= Kramer decides he enjoys showers so much that he is going to spend most of his time in his shower, even going as far as to buy a waterproof phone, prepare a dinner there and install a garbage disposal in his bathtub drain. Elaine's co-worker Peggy (Megan Cole; also seen in the episode \\"The Susie\\") is a germophobe who dislikes Elaine because she thinks she is promiscuous and therefore full of germs. Insulted, Elaine takes revenge on Peggy by going to her office and rubbing the keyboard on her rear end, her stapler under her armpit, and finally coughing on Peggy's doorknob. David Puddy reveals to Elaine that he, too, is a recovering germophobe. Later, Elaine makes up with Peggy by inviting her over for a dinner cooked by Kramer. But when Kramer reveals that he prepared the dinner in the shower, they are all horrified. Peggy and Puddy have to go back to Germophobes Anonymous, with Elaine now joining them.  Critical reception  David Sims of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"Kramer decides to live in his shower because it's Kramer and he does silly things like live in the shower. I do like the setup he creates for himself‚Äîit reminded me of George's under-desk paradise when he worked for the Yankees,\\" referring to the episode \\"The Nap\\". Sims added, \\"The only real misfire in The Apology is Jerry's naked girlfriend of the week who is naked so much that Jerry becomes desensitized to it. This is just a concept that never gets going, as right as Elaine may be about how male nudity is always 'bad naked'.\\" Sims chiefly discusses the guest actors: \\"If nothing else, this is a great Puddy episode... Puddy is the hero of The Apology‚Äîand that's in an episode where James Spader guest stars. Spader is a funny actor for Seinfeld to feature in its ninth season, but his turn here comes at the start of his fallow period, after he was in Crash and then basically never appeared in a commercial movie again, but well before his career revival in The Practice and Boston Legal. He's actually perfect casting for the role of sarcastic recovering alcoholic Jason Hanky‚Äîit's never hard to buy Spader as a jerk, and his recovery clearly hasn't quite cured him of his jerkdom. So we're sort of on George's side, even though his problem with Hanky is pretty dumb, and (surprisingly for season nine) very Larry David...\\" Siyumhaseinfeld writes, \\"This great Top 50 ep has such classic scenes and oft quoted lines as \\"Hanky, others.\\", germaphobe, man you're currently sleeping with, Rum Raisin, Metlife windbreaker, good naked - bad naked, and the whole stapler butt [sic] thing is just great. A welcome addition to the Top 50.\\" For clarity, these are the lines Siumhaseinfeld refers to: * [In the cafe] George: Oh, hello, Hanky, others. * Elaine: She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick. Puddy: Oh, germophobe. I know what that's about. * Peggy: Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs. Puddy: Don't you? ... I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex. Peggy: Really? Puddy: I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in. Elaine: Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies. Puddy: They're bacteria traps. Peggy: So you just learned to live with it? Puddy: For the most part. Elaine: OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day. * Hanky: I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. * George: I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap MetLife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time. * Jerry: But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. * Elaine: Yeah, let me tell you something: this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.

Southeastern European bagpipes known as gaida include: the , , (), () or (), ('), , , also . Construction On this Serbian gajde, the chanter is the short gray pipe at the top, while the drone is the long three-section pipe. Bulgarian gaida player, a pre- 1945 photo. Central State Archive, Sofia Macedonian gaida player =Bag= Gaida bags are generally of sheep or goat hide. Different regions have different ways of treating the hide. The simplest methods involve just the use of salt, while more complex treatments involve milk, flour, and the removal of fur. The hide is normally turned inside out so that the fur is on the inside of the bag, as this helps with moisture buildup within the bag. The stocks into which the chanters and blowpipe and drone fit are called \\"glavini\\" (–≥–ª–∞–≤–∏–Ω–∏) in Bulgarian. These can be made out of cornel wood or animal horn. =Blow pipe= The blow pipe is a short, conical wooden or bone tube in which the player blows to refill the bag. At the end of the blow pipe that is within the bag, there is a small return valve of leather or felt which allows air into the bag via the blow pipe but not back out. In some more primitive gaida there is no flap, but the player blocks returning air with his tongue during breaths. =Reeds = Each chanter is fitted with a reed made from reed (arundo donax), bamboo, or elder. In regional languages these are variously termed lemellas, Piska, or pisak. A more modern variant for the reed is a combination of a cotton phenolic (Hgw2082) material from which the body of the reed is made and a clarinet reed cut to size in order to fit the body. These type of reeds produce a louder sound and are not so sensitive to humidity and temperature changes. =Chanter= The chanter (gaidunitza, gaidanitsa, gajdenica, gajdica, zurle) is the pipe on which the melody is played. Different gaida may have a conical bore (Bulgaria), or cylindrical bore (Macedonia and other regions). Popular woods include boxwood (shimshir) cornel wood, plum wood or other fruit wood. A distinctive feature of the gaida's chanter (which it shares with a number of other Eastern European bagpipes) is the \\"flea-hole\\" (also known as a mumbler or voicer, marmorka) which is covered by the index finger of the left hand. The flea-hole is smaller than the rest and usually consists of a small tube that is made out of metal or a chicken or duck feather. Uncovering the flea-hole raises any note played by a half step, and it is used in creating the musical ornamentation that gives Balkan music its unique character. Some types of gaida can have a double bored chanter, such as the Serbian three-voiced gajde. It has eight fingerholes: the top four are covered by the thumb and the first three fingers of the left hand, then the four fingers of the right hand cover the remaining four holes. =Drone= The drone (ruchilo, ison, prdaljka, prdak, brƒçalo) is a long pipe which provides a constant harmony note, and thus has no finger- holes. It is generally a long, three-piece tube with a note much lower than that of the chanter. History In the old notes of Suetonius, it is described that Emperor Nero played bagpipe called tibiae u tricu larice. In Ancient Rome, it was brought from Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks, however, had taken this instrument from the Hittites, ca. 1000 years BC.For history of the bagpipe, SpiriTell.com Types Gaidas in the Balkans include, but are not limited to:–ó–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –≥–∞–π–¥–∞, http://gaidari.com/gaida * Kaba gaida ‚Äì a large Bulgarian bagpipe of the Rhodope mountains which has a hexagonal and rounded drone.

He created the band wanting to propose a style of modern metal combined with the genres he loved the most: pop, electronic and symphonic music. He wrote the lyrics, composed and arranged all the music. For the first time he only presented himself as keyboard player of the band while the guitar parts were handled by Rhapsody of Fire session member Dominique Leurquin The music of the band combines powerful metal instrumentation with angelic, operatic, female vocals, modern synths and orchestral elements to create a sound that might best be described as 'symphonic electro pop/metal'. The lyrics are about spirituality and deep inner research, linked in someway to the mystic world of dreams. The identity of the vocalist, credited only as \\"Myst\\", is still in question. Fans have speculated Mystique's identity to be Bridget Fogle, who contributed to Turilli's 3rd album The Infinite Wonders of Creation, but as of 2020, this has not been confirmed. Shortly after the release of Lost Horizons, Turilli began work on a second Dreamquest album. In December 2006, it was reported that only the mixing was left to be completed. In 2011, however, Turilli ended work on all his various projects to concentrate on the newly formed Luca Turilli's Rhapsody.

It aired on Saturday mornings on the USA Network between 1993 and 1996 and summarized the weekly events in WWF programming. In its earlier years, Mania usually featured a show exclusive wrestling match. For roughly the first year of its run, Mania also took viewer calls live and only viewers in the Eastern and Central time zones could participate in that portion of the show. History Mania was originally hosted by Todd Pettengill, who was later joined by \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage from 1993 to 1994. From December 1994 to July 1995 Pettengill was joined by Stephanie Wiand. For feature matches (matches exclusive to Mania), Sean Mooney and Lord Alfred Hayes were the broadcasters, until Mooney left in the Spring of 1993, which led to Hayes being phased out from the broadcast booth. From then on Mania used various other broadcasters for the weekly exclusive match, including Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon. The 1994 Slammy Awards took place on an episode of WWF Mania. In September 1996, Mania was rebranded as WWF Blast- Off for the Superstation WGN, while Mania was then discontinued and later replaced with WWF LiveWire. In the United Kingdom, Mania aired on Friday nights and Saturdays at noon on Sky One. During this airing, Mania served as a summary show exclusively for Monday Night Raw until Raw premiered in the United Kingdom in 1995 on Sky Sports.

In 1924, Uiberreither joined the Schill Youth (Schilljugend). He studied law and worked as a construction aid worker. In 1930 he became a secretary for the Workers' Sickness Fund (Arbeiterkrankenkasse) in Graz. In 1931, he joined the SA, and in 1933 he graduated from his studies as a Doctor of Law. In 1937 Uiberreither was leader of the illegal SA Brigade Steiermark. Following Austria's Anschluss with Nazi Germany on 12 March 1938, Uiberreither became an SA-Brigadef√ºhrer and was named Acting Police President for Graz. On 10 April he was elected to the Reichstag. On 25 May 1938, Adolf Hitler appointed him Gauleiter of Styria. On 9 June he was named Landeshauptmann of Styria, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jurisdiction. On 9 November of the same year, he was advanced to the rank of SA-Gruppenf√ºhrer.Karl H√∂ffkes: Hitlers Politische Generale. Die Gauleiter des Dritten Reiches: ein biographisches Nachschlagewerk. Grabert-Verlag, T√ºbingen, 1986, pp. 351-352, . In 1939 Uiberreither married K√§te Wegener (b. 1918), the daughter of Alfred and Else Wegener. They had four sons. The years 1939 and 1940 were ones of military service for Uiberreither, who became a mountain trooper (Gebirgsj√§ger) and participated in the German landing in Norway. In April 1940, he was discharged from the Wehrmacht with the rank of leutnant. On 1 April 1940, Uiberreither became Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) of Styria. On 14 April 1941 after the invasion of Yugoslavia, he was named the Chief of Civil Administration in the occupied area of Lower Styria (now part of Slovenia). On 16 November 1942, he was appointed the Reich Defense Commissioner for his Reichsgau. On 9 November 1943, he was promoted to SA- Obergruppenf√ºhrer. In 1944 he was the leader of the Volkssturm in Styria, a last-ditch home guard set up on Martin Bormann's order's towards the end of the Second World War, and associated with the Nazi \\"Werwolf\\" organization. In May 1945, after the Allies had overrun the Reich and Hitler was dead, Uiberreither was arrested and later compelled to testify as a witness at the Nuremberg Trials.. In 1947, Uiberreither fled when it became clear that there was the threat of being handed over to Yugoslavia.

He is currently the pitching coach at TCU. High school and college Saarloos graduated from Valley Christian High School in Cerritos, California, where he was a three- sport (baseball, football and soccer) athlete. He attended California State University, Fullerton, where he established himself as one of the best closers in college baseball during his sophomore and junior seasons. In 1999, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In , his senior year, he became a starter (the new closer was former Washington Nationals closer Chad Cordero) and established himself as the ace of the staff, winning 15 games with a 2.18 ERA. He was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft in the third round as the 86th overall pick. Professional career Saarloos quickly rose in the Astros organization, making brief stops at Double-A Round Rock and Triple-A New Orleans before being called up to the major leagues in his second year as a professional. In , he went 6-7 with a 6.01 ERA with Houston and was sent down to New Orleans for the next season. In , he again pitched very well in the minors but posted a 4.93 ERA in 36 games for the big club. He also contributed to the Astros' six-pitcher no-hitter of the New York Yankees on June 11, throwing the last out of the third inning and all of the fourth. It was around this time he caught the eye of Oakland Athletics assistant general manager Paul DePodesta. A few weeks into the season, after appearing in only two games for New Orleans, he was traded to the Athletics for Chad Harville. They sent him to Triple-A Sacramento, where he pitched well enough to receive a call-up and start five games for Oakland. In , with Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson traded away, the Athletics had openings in their rotation. Saarloos beat out Keiichi Yabu and Juan Cruz to win the last starter spot in the rotation. Saarloos succeeded, going 10-9 with a 4.17 ERA in 27 starts. He was widely considered to be among the best #5 starters in the American League, sporting one of the lowest home run rates.\\"The Curious Case of Captain Kirk\\", Hardball Times With the signing of veteran starter Esteban Loaiza before the season, the A's bumped Saarloos to the bullpen. Soon after, Rich Harden got injured, and Saarloos was put in as a fifth starter for a few games. He was also used in many varying relief roles, much like Justin Duchscherer was in 2005, but also as a spot starter. Shifting between the bullpen and the rotation, Saarloos finished with a record of 7-7 in 35 games for the A's. He allowed more home runs (19) than the previous season (11). On January 19, , Saarloos signed a one-year $1.2 million deal with the Athletics. On January 23, 2007, Saarloos was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for minor league reliever David Shafer. Both teams also received a player to be named later. On May 28, 2007, Saarloos was sent to the minors after failing to retire any of the seven batters he faced in a 14-10 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates the night before. In his lone season with the Reds, Saarloos had a 7.17 ERA in 42.2 innings. On October 12, 2007, Saarloos was outrighted to the minor leagues. He refused the assignment and became a free agent. On January 15, , Saarloos signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Oakland Athletics. On April 14, he was added to the major league roster but was designated for assignment on April 23. He was sent outright to Triple-A on April 25. On August 18, Saarloos was recalled. He became a free agent at the end of the season. Saarloos signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Cleveland Indians in January ; after training camp, he was sent to Minor League camp on March 24, 2009.Indians Send Sowers, 6 Others to Minors NY Times, March 24, 2009 He went 3-10 in 16 games at the AAA level. He retired after the 2009 season. Scouting Saarloos has a variety of pitches, including a four-seam fastball, a curveball, a slider, and a changeup. However, his best pitch by far is his mid-to-high 80's sinker. For this reason, Saarloos is known predominately as a sinkerball specialist and as such, gets few strikeouts (batters tend to hit groundballs when faced with a sinker). In fact, his 2.99 strikeouts per nine innings in 2005 ranked third to last in Major League Baseball and was the lowest mark in Oakland Athletics history for a starting pitcher.  Coaching career  Saarloos was on the 2011 Cal State Fullerton coaching staff as an undergraduate assistant coach. His primary duties were as pitching coach. Opposing teams batted .250 against his pitchers, and he coached Big West Pitcher of the Year Dylan Floro and four Freshmen All-American pitchers. In 2012, Saarloos returned to Cal State Fullerton as their full-time pitching coach and assisted in recruiting. He became the pitching coach at Texas Christian University in the summer of 2012. He led the team to the lowest ERA in school history since 1968.

Its range extends from Nova Scotia to parts of Georgia. Like other field ants, the Allegheny mound ant builds large mounds, however this species tends to build some of the largest. Aside from the mounds, the ants also act as pests by killing vegetation within of their mounds. The ants inject formic acid into surrounding plants, killing small trees and shrubs. Members of the formic acid producing genus Formica are known for their citrus taste. The Allegheny mound ant's appearance is very striking: both its head and thorax are red-orange; its gaster is black-brown. The ant's colonies are complex. Several different mounds may be interconnected. The tunnels may extend into the ground and upwards in the mound. The mound serves as a solar incubator for the eggs and larvae. Unlike most other ants, Allegheny mound ants have multiple queens. Maturation from egg to adult takes 2.5‚Äì3 months. They hunt a wide assortment of arthropods as a protein source and collect aphid honeydew as a source of sugars. The ants are very aggressive and will bite if a mound is disturbed. In the Northeastern United States, Allegheny mound ants (Formica exsectoides) are credited with causing lesions typically in the form of a deep constriction about 10 cm long on the main stem of small individuals of a variety of species, both hardwoods and conifers, including white pine and Scots pine (Peirson 1922).Peirson, H.B. 1922. Mound-building ants in forest plantations. J. For. 20(4):325‚Äì336. Spruces were not mentioned, but Peirson did not state whether spruces had been examined. The mounds vary in size with age, many reaching 1 m in height and 2 m in diameter. No live trees or shrubs of any height occur in close proximity to the mounds.

For part of its run it is the boundary between Colombia and Venezuela. The major city on its banks is Arauca, Colombia and El Amparo, Venezuela. Course The Arauca is typical of the rivers that flow east across the Llanos Orientales starting as a swift mountain stream and becoming wider and slower as it crosses the plains. It starts high in the Andes, in the P√°ramo del Almorzadero at over above sea level. Initially, it is called the Chitag√°, and it receives inflows from the Carabo and the Cacota, and then twists its course towards the east joining with the Culaga and the Bochaga. Its name then changes to the Margua. The Negro, the Colorado, and the San Lorenzo then flow into it. From the right bank come the Cubug√≥n and the Cobar from the Sierra Nevada de Chita. The Tunebo Indians call this stretch the Sarare. Now flowing across a flat zone, it divides to form the Charo Island. Serving as the demarcation line between Colombia and Venezuela for of border, on the right side, the Royata, Bojab√° and Banad√≠a flow in, and on the left the Cutuf√≠ enters.

Early life Eaton was born in 1860 in Hartford, Connecticut, and at the age of eight, he moved with his family to Twin Mound, Kansas. When Eaton was eight years old, his father, an abolitionist, was shot in cold blood by six former Confederates, who during the war had served with the Quantrill Raiders. The six men, from the Campsey and the Ferber clans, rode with the southerners who after the war called themselves \\"Regulators\\". In 1868, Mose Beaman, his father's friend, said to Frank, \\"My boy, may an old man's curse rest upon you, if you do not try to avenge your father\\". That same year, Mose taught him to handle a gun. Adult life At the age of fifteen, before setting off to avenge his father's death, Eaton said he visited Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, a cavalry fort, to learn more about how to handle a gun. Although too young to join the army, he outshot everyone at the fort and competed with the cavalry's best marksmen, beating them every time. Eaton claimed that after many competitions, the fort's commanding officer, Colonel John Joseph Coppinger, gave Frank a marksmanship badge and a new nickname, \\"Pistol Pete.\\" Like many of his tales, this may not be completely factual. During his teen years, Eaton wrote that he was faster on the draw than Buffalo Bill. From his first days as a lawman, he was said to \\"pack the fastest guns in the Indian Territory.\\" By the end of his career, Eaton would allegedly have eleven notches on his gun. Eaton was said to have been given a cross by a girlfriend, which he wore around his neck and which saved his life when it deflected a bullet during a gunfight. He would write later that, \\"I‚Äôd rather have the prayers of a good woman in a fight than half a dozen hot guns: she‚Äôs talking to Headquarters\\". Eaton claimed to serve as a U.S. Deputy Marshall under ‚Äúhanging judge‚Äù Isaac Parker until late in life https://go.okstate.edu/about-osu/traditions/pistol-pete.html, but no documentation of this could be found by the Curator of the US Marshals Museum in Fort Smith, Arkansas. See comment by User:Montanakennedy, 9 March 2017 at article Talk page. At twenty-nine, he joined the land rush to Oklahoma Territory. He settled southwest of Perkins, Oklahoma where he served as sheriff and later became a blacksmith. He was married twice, had nine children, 31 grandchildren, and lived to see three great-great-grandchildren. He died on April 8, 1958 at the age of 97. Eaton usually carried a loaded .45 Colt and often said \\"I'd rather have a pocket full of rocks than an empty gun.\\" He was also known to throw a coin in the air, draw and shoot it before it hit the ground. The common saying in the mid-western United States, \\"hotter than Pete's pistol,\\" traces back to Eaton's shooting skills, along with his legendary pursuit of his father's killers. Author Frank Eaton wrote two books that exemplify the life of a veteran of the Old West. His first, was an autobiography titled Veteran of the Old West: Pistol Pete, which tells a tale of his life as a Deputy United States Marshal and cowboy. Much of the story of his deputization appears to be fictional, however, as there are no corroborating sources for his claims and there is no record of the Deputy US Marshal and US Judge mentioned.Personal communication and research by Dave Kennedy, Curator, US Marshals Museum Fort Smith, Arkansas, 9 March 2017. See article Talk page. His second book, which was published thirty years after his death, is entitled Campfire Stories: Remembrances of a Cowboy Legend. Campfire Stories is a collection of yarns and recollections that Frank Eaton would tell to the many visitors that came to sit on his front porch in Perkins, Oklahoma. He is buried in the Perkins Cemetery in Perkins, Oklahoma.Francis Boardman \\"Pistol Pete\\" Eaton at Find A Grave OSUIT campus in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. From Cowboy to mascot After seeing Eaton ride a horse in the 1923 Armistice Day parade in Stillwater, Oklahoma with Cowgirl \\"SPO\\" Phillips and Cowpoke \\"Real Deal\\" Rieger, a group of Oklahoma A&M; College (now Oklahoma State University) students decided that Eaton's \\"Pistol Pete\\" would be a suitable mascot for the school. Previously the college had been known as the \\"Princeton of the Prairie\\" with a tiger mascot and colors of orange and black. Many at the school were unhappy with the \\"Tigers\\" mascot and felt \\"Pistol Pete,\\" symbolic of the American Old West and Oklahoma's land run roots, better represented the college. Soon afterward, The Oklahoma Times began calling A&M;'s teams the \\"Cowboys\\" rather than the Aggies. \\"Cowboys\\" and \\"Aggies\\" were used interchangeably until the school became Oklahoma State in 1957, and \\"Cowboys\\" became the sole nickname. However, it was not until 1958 that \\"Pistol Pete\\" was adopted as the school's mascot. The familiar caricature of \\"Pistol Pete\\" was officially sanctioned in 1984 by the university as a licensed symbol. In more recent years, the University of Wyoming and New Mexico State University began using variations of OSU's artwork as logos for their schools. To this day, his likeness is a visible reminder of the Old West to literally millions of people yearly as a symbol of colleges whose mascots pay homage to the cowboy. NMSU recently updated their logo design which is distinct from the OSU logo of Pistol Pete. Director's Award On March 15, 1997, the National Cowboy Hall of Fame posthumously honored Frank Eaton with the Director's Award.

Relatives of the founder of the chain founded Loveman's of Alabama and Loveman's located in Nashville, Tennessee. History  In 1875, David Bernard Loveman and his brother Herman Herschel Loveman arrived in Chattanooga from Atlanta, Georgia and formed D. B. Loveman and Bro., a dry goods concern. In 1877, Ismar Noa joined the company and it became D. B. Loveman & Company. In 1884 they purchased property at the southeast corner of Eighth and Market Streets, in what was described as \\"the most important single real estate transaction that had taken place\\" in Chattanooga up until that time. Building commenced in 1885, and the city's first department store was constructed. It would become Chattanooga's largest department store, and remain so for just over a hundred years. December 26, 1891, the building was destroyed by fire and the business suffered accordingly. David even declared bankruptcy, but business did not cease. Eventually the company regained its footing and prospered, employing 300 people by 1917. In addition to the downtown Chattanooga flagship store, Loveman's expanded to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, along with several suburban stores in Chattanooga with locations such as East Ridge, Tennessee. Loveman's established a store at Eastgate Mall in 1965. In the early 1970s, Loveman's located in the former JCPenney store in Highland Plaza. (In 1972, JCPenney opened at the then new Northgate Mall in nearby Hixson.) In 1980, Loveman's was an original anchor at Walnut Square Mall in Dalton, Georgia. Loveman's final expansion came as an anchor at Hamilton Place Mall in 1987. In 1988, however, the chain, which had acquired considerable debt, was bought by Proffitt's, which in turn was acquired in 2005 by Belk. Starting in 2001, the flagship downtown building had been converted to mixed use, with luxury condominiums on the upper floors developed by RiverCity Company. \\"Revival for Lovemans, at last,\\" Chattanooga Times Free Press, Jun 21, 2001.River City Company website, Loveman's on Market development (retrieved Aug 30, 2008) .

He was the namesake of Dundy County, Nebraska.  Biography  Born on March 5, 1830, in Trumbull County, Ohio, Dundy read law in 1853. He entered private practice in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, and Falls City, Nebraska Territory (unorganized territory until May 30, 1854) from 1853 to 1858. He was a member of the Council of the Territory of Nebraska from 1858 to 1862. In June, 1861 Elmer Dundy married Ohio native Mary H. Robison and they had a son a year later, Elmer Scipio Dundy Jr., followed by 3 daughters: Mary Mae, Luna, and Enid Alva (died at one year of age).David H. Price, The public life of Elmer S. Dundy, 1857-1896, University of Nebraska at Omaha - 1971, pages 143 - 144 He resumed private practice in Falls City from 1862 to 1863. He was a Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Territory from 1863 to 1868. = Federal judicial service = Following the admission of the State of Nebraska to the Union on March 1, 1867, Dundy was nominated by President Andrew Johnson on April 4, 1868, to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, to a new seat authorized by 15 Stat. 5. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 9, 1868, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on October 28, 1896, due to his death in Omaha, Nebraska.  Notable cases  On May 12, 1879, Dundy ruled in the case Standing Bear v. Crook that Standing Bear and other Ponca were \\"people\\" who able to bring petitions for habeas corpus, and that Indians who had severed their relationships with their tribes could not be ordered to a reservation against their will. The next year, Dundy was part of the lower court panel that heard Elk v. Wilkins, which asserted that Indians who had left their tribes and submitted to the jurisdiction of the United States were American citizens. In 1884, the United States Supreme Court rejected Elk's petition, holding that Indians born in tribal relations in the United States could only become citizens under specific federal laws.Elk v. Wilkins, 112 U.S. 94, 99 (1884). It was not until 1924 that all Indians born in the United States were declared citizens with the passing of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.  Dundy County  Dundy was the namesake of Dundy County, Nebraska.  \\"Skip\\" Dundy  Judge Dundy's son, Elmer \\"Skip\\" Dundy, c. 1900. Dundy's son, Elmer Scipio Dundy Jr., better known as \\"Skip\\" Dundy, was born in Falls City, Nebraska in 1862. Skip Dundy grew up to become a promoter on Coney Island, due to in part the stories told by Buffalo Bill Cody who was a familiar visitor in the Dundy home.

They often only approximate a gravitational singularity in the scientific sense in that they are massive, localized distortions of space and time. The name invokes one of the most fundamental problems remaining in modern physics: the difficulty in uniting Einstein's theory of relativity, which includes singularities within its models of black holes, and quantum mechanics. In fact, since according to relativity, singularities, by definition, are infinitely small, and expected to be quantum mechanical by nature, a theory of quantum gravity would be required to describe their behaviour. No such theory has yet been formulated. Star Trek A Star Trek quantum singularity is a phenomenon of multiple varieties. One such variety appears in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Parallax\\" which creates a mirror image along with a temporal distortion. Voyager flies into the singularity after seeing an image of itself inside, and becomes trapped. To escape, the crew uses a shuttle to fire a tachyon beam at the entry. In the Voyager episode \\"Hunters\\", the crew discover a Hirogen relay station almost 100,000 years old, powered by a quantum singularity, also referred to by Tom Paris as a black hole. The word \\"tiny\\" being used to describe a quantum singularity, about \\"a centimeter\\" in diameter, making it relatively large, although it is more likely that the stated diameter instead refers to the singularity's event horizon. In the episode \\"Scorpion\\", Species 8472 and the Borg, make use of quantum singularities to travel to and from fluidic space. Artificial quantum singularities are also used to power Romulan Warbirds as first described in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Face of the Enemy\\". Additionally, in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Visionary\\", the side effects from quantum singularities cause Miles O'Brien to shift through time. Futurama In the Futurama episode \\"Love and Rocket\\", after Bender breaks up with the Planet Express ship, whom he only dated during this episode, the ship, which took the break-up pretty hard, threatens to fly into a giant quasar. Thus \\"the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity.\\" Bender gets the crew out of the situation by professing his love for the ship, albeit sarcastically, which distracts it long enough for Fry and Leela to disable the ship's logical processes and restore life support systems. Megas XLR In the Megas XLR episode \\"Battle Royale\\", the villain Magnanimous threatens to drop Kiva and Jamie into a quantum singularity, which he says is \\"like a black hole, only portable, and with a cooler name.\\" Farscape In the Farscape episode \\"Back and Back and Back to the Future\\", a scientist belonging to the Ilanic race develops a quantum singularity ultimate weapon, described essentially as a portable black hole, to be used against their enemies. Stargate SG-1 The Supergate, a gigantic Stargate designed by the Ori to allow the intergalactic transport of starships, is made up of 90 smaller pieces assembled using a regular Stargate. Once interconnected, a nearby planet is collapsed into a quantum singularity using a special force field to provide the massive power needed to open a wormhole to the Ori galaxy. Samantha Carter theorizes that the singularity allows a connection to be maintained indefinitely. The first Ori attempt to create a Supergate in the Milky Way fails, when Vala Mal Doran inserts her Tel'tak into the incomplete ring and prevents the segments from connecting completely. The shockwave from the forming singularity blasts the gate into oblivion. A second Supergate is later successfully built allowing a fleet of Ori motherships passage into the Milky Way. The SGC eventually blocks Ori access to the Supergate by opening a connection from a Pegasus gate powered by a \\"natural\\" black hole. City of Heroes In the MMORPG City of Heroes, the quantum singularity is the \\"pet\\" power a gravity controller attains at level 32. The singularity takes the form of a portable human sized ball of light surrounded by waves of coloured energy that follows its summoner. The singularity has a variety of gravity based attacks.

The disease may be present at birth or occur shortly thereafter. The cause is unknown. Both familial and sporadic forms occur. It is also known as Caffey disease or Caffey's disease. Presentation An affected infant typically has the following triad of signs and symptoms: soft-tissue swelling, bone lesions, and irritability. The swelling occurs suddenly, is deep, firm, and may be tender. Lesions are often asymmetric and may affect several parts of the body. Affected bones have included the mandible, tibia, ulna, clavicle, scapula, ribs, humerus, femur, fibula, skull, ilium, and metatarsals. When the mandible (lower jaw bone) is affected, infants may refuse to eat, leading to failure to thrive. Genetics It has been associated with COL1A1. Pathophysiology In the early stages of infantile cortical hyperostosis, biopsy shows inflammation of the periosteum and adjacent soft tissues. After this resolves, the periosteum remains thickened, and subperiosteal immature lamellar bone can be seen on biopsy, while the bone marrow spaces contain vascular fibrous tissue. Eventually the inflammation and subperiosteal changes resolve, and hyperplasia of lamellar cortical bone can be seen. Radiographs initially show layers of periosteal new bone formation with cortical thickening. Periosteal new bone may cover the diaphysis of the bone, causing an increase in diameter of the bone. Over time, the periosteal new bone density increases, becoming homogenous with the underlying cortex. Eventually the bone remodels and resumes a normal appearance. Diagnosis Anteroposterior radiograph of the skull showed massive sclerosis of the skull bone associated with significant cortical hyperostosis and enlargement of the mandible secondary to cortical new bone formation. Most infants with infantile cortical hyperostosis are diagnosed by physical examination. X-rays can confirm the presence of bone changes and soft tissue swelling. Biopsy of the affected areas can confirm the presence of typical histopathological changes. No specific blood tests exist, but tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and alkaline phosphatase levels are often elevated. A complete blood count may show anemia (low red blood cell count) and leukocytosis (high white blood cell count). Other tests may be done to help exclude other diagnoses. Ultrasound imaging can help diagnose prenatal cases. =Differential diagnosis= Osteomyelitis (bone infection), which is much more common than infantile cortical hyperostosis, must be excluded, since it requires urgent treatment. Other diagnoses that can mimic this disorder and need to be excluded include physical trauma, child abuse, Vitamin A excess, hyperphosphatemia, prostaglandin E1 and E2 administration, scurvy, infections (including syphilis), Ewing sarcoma, and metastatic neuroblastoma. Prognosis Infantile cortical hyperostosis is a self-limited condition, meaning that the disease resolves on its own without treatment, usually within 6‚Äì9 months. Long-term deformities of the involved bones, including bony fusions and limb- length inequalities, are possible but rare. Epidemiology The disease has been reported to affect 3 per 1000 infants younger than 6 months in the United States. No predilection by race or sex has been established. Almost all cases occur by the age of 5 months. The familial form is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance. The familial form tends to have an earlier onset and is present at birth in 24% of cases, with an average age at onset of 6.8 weeks. The average age at onset for the sporadic form is 9‚Äì11 weeks. Cortical hyperostosis is a potential side effect of long-term use of prostaglandins in neonates. History Dr. John Caffey (1895‚Äì1978) first described infantile cortical hyperostosis in 1945. He described a group of infants with tender swelling in the soft tissues and cortical thickenings in the skeleton, with onset of these findings during the first 3 months of life. Dr. Caffey was regarded throughout the world as the father of pediatric radiology. His classic textbook, Pediatric X-Ray Diagnosis, which was first published in 1945, has become the recognized bible and authority in its field.

It is the stand-alone sequel to the 2000 film Hollow Man, released direct-to- video on May 23, 2006. Plot At a cocktail party at the Reisner Institute, a Washington think tank, an invisible force drags a scientist named Devin into a nearby bathroom, where the force (implied to be a person) brutally throws Devin around for information. Devin mentions another scientist, Maggie Dalton, who knows the \\"formula\\" the invisible person is looking for. Apparently accepting this, the man releases him, warning him not to tell anyone he was there. As soon as the invisible man leaves (or rather, pretends to leave), Devin attempts to call someone on his cell phone, but the invisible man smashes the phone and slashes Devin's throat. The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct a murder investigation, but the laboratory's military supervisor, Colonel Gavin Bishop, insists it is an internal military situation and the police have no jurisdiction. Fearing attacks on the remaining scientists, the lab's owner, Dr. William Reisner, employs Frank Turner and his partner, Detective Lisa Martinez, to protect Maggie, but refuses to divulge any information on the nature of his work. The two detectives stand guard outside Maggie's house. When Lisa opens the door to let the cat in, the invisible man sneaks past her into the house. Just as he reaches the study where Maggie is, Lisa tracks him down, and he strangles her with a lamp's power cord. Suddenly, armed military commandos appear and storm the house, using thermal goggles to target and corner the invisible man. Outside, Turner confronts Bishop, realizing that they used him and Lisa to lure the invisible man to the house. Several stun grenades go off around the house, incapacitating the soldiers and allowing the invisible man to escape in pursuit of Turner and Maggie. He almost catches up to them, but is struck and badly injured by a car, and flees. Maggie is taken into protective custody by the police, where Turner's superior and friend, Captain Tom Harrison, has received orders to have her transferred to military custody. Frank helps Maggie escape from the police station and they flee in a stolen car. Bishop and Reisner, knowing their careers would end if Maggie talks, declare them fugitives. Maggie later tells Turner that five years prior, a team of scientists figured out how to make humans invisible, but something went wrong, leaving only two survivors. A year after the original project was scrapped, the Reisner Institute restarted the experiments as a covertly Department of Defense-funded operation to create the perfect soldier, codenamed \\"Silent Knight\\", which attempts to render humans invisible. The resulting serum does turn human tissue invisible, but with adverse effects: as it allows light to pass directly through the subject, the radiation damages the cells and causes physical and mental degradation, slowly killing the person. Maggie developed a compound called the \\"Buffer\\" to counteract the effects of that particular radiation. A soldier named Michael Griffin volunteered, and the serum succeeded, but the Buffer failed and Griffin seemingly died, which in turn got Maggie fired. Maggie believes that Griffin faked his death so he could use his powers without restraint, but now needs the antidote to the radiation before he dies. Maggie receives a message from a man named Ludlow, who has been in contact with her for weeks. Turner uses his contacts to find Ludlow, a soldier enlisted into the program after Sebastian Caine (the original guinea pig), but before Griffin. He had gone into hiding, but is now slowly dying from radiation. Ludlow has also been tracking Griffin, and reveals the true story to his supposed \\"death\\" and the program itself: Operation Silent Knight was never about national security, and neither was Griffin given the Buffer, since the Department used him to assassinate their political enemies. Meanwhile, Griffin infiltrates Bishop's office and both get into a fight. The latter attempts to reason with him and then, getting desperate, stabs him, but not kills him, with a pen. Griffin impales Bishop with the same pen, and uses his computer to locate Ludlow. Arriving at the hideout, Griffin attacks Turner, but Ludlow intervenes, sacrificing himself to allow Turner and Maggie to escape. Griffin decides to make them return by capturing Maggie's sister. When they meet at the train station where he is hiding, Griffin silently catches Maggie and tries to turn her invisible so he can take her unnoticed, but Turner intervenes. After a short fight, Griffin escapes with Maggie, leaving Turner with the arriving Reisner and his guards. A short time later, Reisner pursues an invisible man, but is soon captured and held by him. Believing him to be Griffin, he offers to send for the Buffer. The figure, however, is Turner, who used Griffin's discarded syringe to become invisible as well. Reisner, backing away, is hit and killed by a speeding car. Griffin takes Maggie to her old college laboratory to create the Buffer for him. Griffin forces her to inject herself with it first, then injects himself with another dose. With his survival seemingly assured, Griffin tries to kill Maggie, but Turner intervenes and knocks him out of the laboratory window. Turner runs outside, where Griffin renders him unconscious. As Griffin slowly turns visible, Maggie reveals that he has been poisoned, as the vial contained rat poison; she loses consciousness. Enraged, Griffin takes a shovel and attempts to kill her, but Turner, having recovered, stops him and impales him with the shovel. He then carries Maggie away for medical attention, leaving Griffin's body outside in the rain. A few days later, Maggie is recovering in hospital and is poised to be released. Heather tells her that Turner has not been found. Maggie insists that he will come back to her, as she knows that he needs her. Outside, they are being watched by a hooded invisible man, presumably Turner, who then walks away.

It was named to recognize the occurrence of similar fossil teeth in Central Asia and North America. These regions once formed a connected land mass, during the Cretaceous period and were referred to as Asiamerica. The teeth were discovered by L. A. Nesov in 1995. The findings were based on three teeth found in the central Kyzylkum desert, Uzbekistan, in deposits of the Bissekty Formation, dated to the mid-late Turonian age of the Late Cretaceous, about 90 million years ago. They are comparable to other teeth found in Kazakhstan and North America, which have been illustrated but not formally described. The type species is A. asiaticus. The teeth themselves are straight, lack a constriction at the base, and lack serrations.Nessov, 1995.

[in Russian with short English, German, and French abstracts]. Classification In his initial description of the unusual teeth, Nesov speculated that they may belong to either saurodont fish or to spinosaurid dinosaurs. He later changed his opinion, deciding that they definitely represented fish remains,Nessov, L.A. (1997). Cretaceous nonmarine vertebrates of northern Eurasia. Saint Petersburg: University of Saint Petersburg Institute of Earth Crust, 218 pp. [in Russian]. and this opinion was followed by most later researchers who excluded them from reviews of spinosaurid teeth for this reason.Buffetaut, Suteethorn, Tong and Amiot (2008). \\"An Early Cretaceous spinosaurid theropod from southern China.\\" Geological Magazine, 145(5): 745‚Äì748.

(meaning \\"eye of the rose\\" in Syriac) ‚Äì is a village that lies very high, east of the city Midyat, in the Mardin Province of Turkey, and can be reached from Midyat on foot in 2 hours. The village was founded some time around the 10th century. History =First World War= Prior to the start of the First World War, the village had about 200 families, all of whom belonged to the Syriac Orthodox Church. During the Assyrian Genocide, tens of thousands of refugees from throughout Tur Abdin arrived here for safety. At one point, the number of people in the village was up to 21,980 people. Refugees arrived from villages including Habasnos, Midyat, Bote, Keferze, Kafro Eloyto, Mzizah and Urnas. Even refugees from outside Tur Abdin arrived, coming from villages such as Deqlath, Bscheriye, Gozarto, Hesno d Kifo and Mifarqin. Being aware of the Turks and Kurds were coming to G√ºlg√∂ze, the villagers and refugees created a militia to defend themselves, which was led by Gallo Shabo. Their resistance lasted 60 days, and ended in success. https://www.atour.com/history/1900/20110520a.html At the same time, the Kurdish authority of Midyat was given orders to attack G√ºlg√∂ze and Arnas. However, Aziz Agha, the leader of the Midyat area, told them that they didn't have enough soldiers to attack both areas, and therefore they would attack Gulgoze only, and then go to Arnas later on. Therefore, The Kurds of Tur Abdin and Ramman, under the generalship of Ahmed Agha and Salem Agha, collected themselves in Mardin, and created a unit of 13,000 men. The government authorized the distribution of arms, and they headed towards G√ºlg√∂ze, arriving late at night to begin the siege. After hours of gun-battle, the villagers defeated the Kurds and drove them out, but there were many casualties on both sides regardless. After 10 days, The Kurds attacked again only to be beaten yet again, as they lost well over 300 men. Before the beginning of a third attempt, Kurdish leaders called for aid from the mayors of Diyarbakƒ±r (Raschid) and Mardin (Badri). However, after a third attempt also failed and after 30 days of battle, Aziz Agha suggested a peace treaty between the two sides. 3 villagers met with Aziz to discuss a peace treaty, But the villagers refused to lay down their weapons, thus the battle continued. The siege continued for another 30 days leading to many deaths on both sides. In the end, the Kurdish soldiers surrendered and left the Syriac Orthodox population of Tur Abdin alone, hence why the Tur Abdin region is the only Christian populated area left in Turkey outside of Istanbul. The total death toll of this 60-day siege is unknown, but there were at least 1,000 deaths with both sides losses combined.

It was notable for being one of the stronger football simulations of its time, with statistical models to not only the NFL season, but also the outcome of a single football game. Being one of the first football games for the PC it is still considered one of the best requiring 10 man-years to make and over 30,000 lines of code. Game play Unlike most football games, this one was more abstract. The players acted as coaches, picking the offensive or defensive plays from a series of nested menus. The computer then ran the plays against each other, using the pre-configured abilities of the teams and players picked. There was no interaction once the play was called, other than making a decision to accept or deny a penalty if called. This made for an abstract game, unlike others where the player actually participated in the offense or defense. One of the user changeable features of the game was the fact that you could create or edit your own dream team, or enhance the performance of a particular current player who was having a good season, via a simple text edit of the roster files. The rosters were all named by team with player numbers as opposed to names being stored, but you easily determine which player was which and arrange trades, enhancements, or create an All-Pro team to play against regular teams. Reception Computer Gaming World called NFL Challenge \\"the finest computer sports game I've ever seen. It is a high- tech, state-of-the-art simulation that is truly remarkable in recreating the 'feel' of a professional football game\\". It cited the documentation, detailed and accurate playbook, and team statistics as strengths, while lack of player names or statistics was a weakness, and concluded \\"Visicalc is the program that sold Apple computers, NFLC may be the one that sells IBM PC's to sports gamers\\". Cultural references ESPN used the simulation in 1988 for a program called NFL Dream Season. Historic NFL teams were computer-simulated against one another in an 8-week season, then playoffs, then the \\"Dream Bowl\\". ESPN used the computer simulation results to play back the game using NFL Films footage, to make it appear that one was watching an actual game. The 1978 Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the 1972 Miami Dolphins 21-20, The following year, ESPN broadcast Dream Bowl II, with the defending champion Steelers pitted against the then-Super Bowl Champion San Francisco 49ers. Even with John Stallworth out early in the game due to an injury, the Steelers defeated the 49ers in overtime, when Joe Montana was intercepted around mid field by Mel Blount, who returned the interception for a touchdown. Steve Sabol, NFL Films president, said he disagreed with the simulation result, feeling that San Francisco had a better team. XOR made available the Dream Season disk after the show's run, with the actual teams used by ESPN's program. Company Demise The company went out of business in the early 1990s, after advertising NFL Challenge Premium Edition, which never made it to market. There were several customers who had prepaid for the product, only to never receive the game.

It is a branch of the Maratha Seva Sangh. The Brigade is named after the Maratha king Sambhaji son of the first Maratha king Shivaji and gained exposure after they attacked and vandalised the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune in protest against American scholar James Laine‚Äôs book on Shivaji titled Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India. Currently the head of this organisation is Pravin Gaikwad. Sambhaji Brigade demands reservation for the Maratha community and wants inclusion of Marathas in Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. They also demand free education for Maratha children and registered marriages instead of religious ceremonies. The organization has been described as having an anti-Brahmin caste stand and has been repeatedly criticized for its extremist views. Controversies Sambhaji Brigade is known for aggressive and violent agitations. Their first violent protest was an attack on Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. Several historical records were destroyed in this attack including handwritten copies by Adya Shankaracharya. This was followed by uprooting of Dadoji Kondev's Statue from Lal Mahal, then by attacks on Waghya dog's statue on Raigad fort and then by attacks on R. R. Patil. =2004 James Laine incident= Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune A group of brigade members attacked and vandalised the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute(BORI) in January 2004. The attack was prompted by the controversy over James Laine's controversial book Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India (OUP, 2003); scholars from the institute had collaborated with Laine on information for his book about the founder of the Maratha Empire, Shivaji, which the group had viewed as blasphemy claiming that book features \\"derogatory remarks on Shivaji and his mother\\". Angry mob of Sambhaji Brigade stormed the BORI and destroyed priceless manuscripts and artifacts. Then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee condemned this violence though he upheld the importance of disagreement and debate in a democracy. After the incident 72 members of the group were arrested. In 2004 the director-general of police announced that a legal ban on the organization was being investigated, but as of 2015, organization has never been banned. =Statue of Dadoji Konddev= In 2010, NCP-controlled Pune Municipal Corporation's (PMC) decision to remove the statue of Dadoji Kondadev was claimed to be consistent with the party's policy to encourage demands of hardline Maratha groups. It is claimed that such a stance had helped the NCP maintain its dominance among the Maratha youth in Pune and rural Maharashtra. Sambhaji Brigade was also involved in a protest to remove the statue of Dadoji Kondadev from Lal Mahal in Pune claiming that he was just introduced as teacher of Shivaji by Brahmin historians. About 30 to 40 people entered Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and attacked Mayor's office. This led to a statewide protest by Political parties such as BJP, Shiv Sena and MNS.Dadoji‚Äôs statue in Pune sparks statewide protests , Mumbai Mirror Following to this Government of Maharashtra (which included NCP) removed name of Dadoji Konddev from school history books stating that Government's committee of historians found no evidence that Dadoji Konddev was teacher of Shivaji. The move was heavily criticized by historians and scholars. Some members of the government-appointed committee also resigned in protest citing that the committee head Jaysing Pawar only had caste considerations in mind when submitting the report, without regard to actual historical evidence. = Attack on Waghya's Statue on Raigad Fort = Statue of Waghya at Raigad Fort The group was also responsible for a protest and attack against a dog's (Waghya) statue located on Raigad Fort next to Shivaji's memorial. According to legend the dog (named Waghya) was Shivaji's dog. The group claimed that the dog was not real and there should not be a memorial for it. This act was strongly opposed by local Dhangar community for they believe that the dog was real.Maratha outfit declares war on Shivaji's dog , IBN Live In fact many people say that Waghya was Shivaji's dog and the reason for why the memorial was constructed over there. =Ram Ganesh Gadkari bust vandalism= In January 2017, four Sambhaji Brigade followers pulled down a bust of celebrated Marathi playwright Ram Ganesh Gadkari which was located in Sambhaji Park in central Pune and threw it in the nearby Mutha river. The Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu (CKP), the community to which Gadkari belonged later organized a meeting to protest this incident at the Ram Ganesh Gadkari Rangayatan (a theater named after Gadkari) in Thane. Sambhaji Brigade claimed that Gadkari had portrayed Sambhaji in bad light in an unfinished play Rajsanyas, written a century ago by referring to some out-of-context content. Indian National Congress leader Nitesh Rane later rewarded the vandals and made inflammatory remarks claiming that he had announced a reward earlier in 2016 for removing the bust, and was proud of the act carried out by the accused. He also tweeted that Sambhaji Brigade was not involved in the act, even when the outfit had claimed responsibility for the action. The vandalism was largely seen as an attempt to garner votes by playing the community card in the city's civic elections which were due to be held in a few weeks.  Leadership  Purushottam Khedekar is one of the founders of this organisation. He is also a prominent leader in the Maratha Seva Sangh, a related organisation and co-founder of Shiva Dharma. Khedekar has written several anti-Brahmin books like Bhatta Cha Kardhankal (a book with virulently anti-Brahmin propaganda) and Maharaj Mala Maaf Kara (Translates as \\"Your Majesty, I ask for your forgiveness\\". This book abused 17th century Marathi Hindu saint Samarth Ramdas. Pune Police issued an arrest warrant against Khedekar for inciting anti-Brahmin feelings and causing caste discrimination. In 2015 he submitted an affidavit in the court and apologized unconditionally for his remarks on Brahmin women. Shiva Dharma The Maratha Seva Sangh, founded by Khedekar, has been demanding reservations for the Maratha community and is also supporting creation of a new religion of its own called 'Shiva Dharma' with Bahujan icons as Gods.

It was found in the Farmington Member of the Kirtland Formation, in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, United States. Only a partial skull has been found to date. It was first described as a specimen of Kritosaurus by Jack Horner, and has been intertwined with Kritosaurus since its description. It is known for its short nasal crest, which stuck out above and between its eyes for a short distance. Description The anatomy of Anasazisaurus is poorly known. The skull is somewhat poorly preserved, lacks the lower jaw, beak, and quadrate, and was only recently fully prepared. It has a sort of tab or flange of bone, from the nasals, that rises between and above the eyes and folds back under itself. This unique crest allows it to be distinguished from similar hadrosaurs, like Gryposaurus. The top of the crest is roughened, and the maximum preserved length of the skull is ~90 centimeters (~35 in). According to Gregory S. Paul, it was about 7.5 meters long and weigh up to 2500 kg.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 306 Classification Anasazisaurus is a saurolophine hadrosaurid, meaning it lacked a hollow crest. The most recent review recognized it as distinct, but did not try to place it beyond Hadrosaurinae. History Adrian Hunt and Spencer G. Lucas, American paleontologists, named this dinosaur in 1993. Its name is derived from the Anasazi, an ancient Native American people, and the Greek word sauros (\\"lizard\\"). The Anasazi were famous for their cliff-dwellings, such as those in Chaco Canyon, near the location of fossil Anasazisaurus remains. The term \\"Anasazi\\" itself is actually a Navajo language word, anaas√°z√≠ (\\"enemy ancestors\\"). There is one known species (A. horneri), which is named in honor of Jack Horner, an influential paleontologist who first described the skull in 1992. The holotype skull (and only known specimen) was collected in the late 1970s by a Brigham Young University field party working in San Juan County, and is housed at BYU as BYU 12950. Horner originally assigned the skull to Kritosaurus navajovius. Later, Hunt and Lucas claimed that the Kritosaurus holotype was undiagnostic and judged the genus to be a nomen dubium. They decided to give BYU 12950 new name Anasazisaurus horneri. Some later authors, including those of the most recent review, followed this decision. However, others disagreed, including Thomas Williamson, who made the most detailed published case. In a paper published in 2014, Alberto Prieto-Marquez agreed that Anasazisaurus horneri is similar to Kritosaurus navajovius, but found it distinct enough to be considered a valid species of Kritosaurus, as K. horneri.Prieto-M√°rquez, A. 2014. \\"Skeletal morphology of Kritosaurus navajovius (Dinosauria:Hadrosauridae) from the Late Cretaceous of the North American south-west, with an evaluation of the phylogenetic systematics and biogeography of Kritosaurini\\". Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 12(2): 133-175 Paleoecology and paleobiology Anasazisaurus was discovered in the Farmington Member of the Kirtland Formation, which is one of the lower members. This formation dates from the late Campanian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period (73-74 million years ago), and is also the source of several other dinosaurs, like Bistahieversor, Kritosaurus, Naashoibitosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Pentaceratops, Nodocephalosaurus, Saurornitholestes, and Ziapelta.Weishampel, David B.; Barrett, Paul M.; Coria, Rodolfo A.; Le Loeuff, Jean; Xu Xing; Zhao Xijin; Sahni, Ashok; Gomani, Elizabeth, M.P.; and Noto, Christopher R. (2004). \\"Dinosaur Distribution\\". The Dinosauria (2nd). 517‚Äì606. As a hadrosaurid, Anasazisaurus would have been a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Its teeth were continually replacing and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material would have been cropped by its beak, and held in the jaws by a muscular cheek. Feeding would have been from the ground up to ~4 meters (13 ft) above.

He is a decorated Canadian military officer and the country‚Äôs first general to command American troops in combat since the Second World War. His most noteworthy role was as Brigadier- General in the battle of Operation Medusa, which took place in Afghanistan from September 1‚Äì17, 2006 as part of NATO‚Äôs coalition efforts in the region. Since retiring from the Canadian Armed Forces in 2011 after 32 years of service, Fraser has worked in the private sector, currently serving as president of AEGIS Six Corporation. In May 2018, he released Operation Medusa: The Furious Battle That Saved Afghanistan from the Taliban, which he co- authored with Brian Hanington. The book recounts his experience as commander of NATO forces in this battle, detailing the preparation, execution and aftermath of the conflict. Education Fraser studied political science and psychology at Carleton University in Ottawa, graduating in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts. He graduated from the Canadian Armed Forces Command and Staff College in Toronto in 1990 and earned a Master of Management and Policy from the Royal Military College and Queen's University in 2001. He completed the American Capstone program and trained at the Ivey Business School, where he currently acts as a mentor. Military career Fraser joined the Canadian Armed Forces after graduating from Carleton University in 1980. His responsibilities and positions over the next 19 years were varied, including acting as chief of staff for the Alberta District, working as a Canadian officer responsible for domestic and international planning, and commanding Infantry Battalion in Canada and Bosnia. Fraser then worked as director of the Canadian Army Reserve Restructure in Ottawa from 2001 to 2003 and as co- director of the Bi-National Planning Group in Colorado Springs from 2003 to 2005. He deployed to Afghanistan in January 2006, where, as a Brigadier- General, he commanded thousands of NATO troops. One of his main responsibilities there was to lead Operation Medusa in southern Afghanistan that September. Fraser subsequently acted as commandant of the Canadian Forces College in Toronto from 2007 to 2009 and led the Joint Headquarters Renewal Project in 2009 and 2010. He directed the Land Force Doctrine and Training System, and the 1st Canadian Division until 2011, retiring from military service that year. Civilian career Fraser‚Äôs first appointment in the private sector was as chief operating officer of Blue Goose Pure Foods, a retailer of organic meats headquartered in Toronto. He took up the same position at INKAS, a national manufacturing company specializing in armoured vehicles, until June 2016. Fraser has since worked professionally as a public speaker. In 2016, he delivered the keynote address at the FABTECH Canada conference, focusing his remarks on the nature of effective teamwork and leadership. Operation Medusa Operation Medusa, which took place from September 1 to 17, 2006 during the second Battle of Panjwaii, was a seminal moment in Canada‚Äôs involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan. Intended to secure the authority of the democratic government of Afghanistan in the south of the country, the Canada-led offensive was the largest battle fought by Canadian troops since the country‚Äôs involvement in the Korean War. Fraser was sent to the southern Afghan province of Kandahar, where, as Commander of Regional Command South, he controlled thousands of NATO troops in the southern Afghan provinces of Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul, Uruzgan, Daikundi and Nimroz. The battle spanned a stretch of the Arghandab River valley west of the city of Kandahar. The Taliban amassed on the north side as NATO forces pushed forward from the southern bank. The operation was generally considered successful as it maintained NATO‚Äôs credibility within the region and overwhelmed the Taliban forces, which suffered heavy losses. These successes of Operation Medusa came at the cost of six Canadian and twelve British lives. Then General and Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier commented afterward on the toll of the first two days of the operation, underscoring the loss of life. Charles Company of the Royal Canadian Regiment was hit particularly hard. On September 4, an American A10 warthog aircraft mistakenly strafed the company as it was preparing to attack a Taliban position, resulting in one death and thirty injuries. Despite this and other unforeseen difficulties such as running out of ammunition, the Canadians prevented further advance of the Taliban within Afghanistan. In his book Operation Medusa: The Furious Battle That Saved Afghanistan from the Taliban, Fraser assessed the effect of the operation, calling it a costly yet necessary fight that enabled Afghanistan to continue as a democracy. The efforts of the Canadians and their allies were instrumental in enabling Afghan leaders to develop a new constitution, to ensure free and democratic elections, to make it possible for more girls to go to school, and to initiate reform in defence, justice and finance structures within the country. =Controversy= Despite its success, the operation and its aftermath were not without controversy. In 2007 and 2008, newspaper reports revealed that the Leopard tanks sent to Afghanistan had been taken from Canadian monuments. Fraser had requested tanks for the operation to make advances into Taliban- occupied settlements while minimizing collateral damage. According to the Canadian Army, however, such reports were exaggerated since it retained sufficient numbers of functioning tanks in its inventory at the time. In 2017, Canada‚Äôs defence minister Harjit Sajjan, who had served as the primary liaison between Canadian commanders and local Afghan leaders during the conflict, claimed that he had been the architect of the operation. Later that year, Sajjan issued a formal apology for embellishing his role in the battle after he was criticized by fellow military personnel. His apology included reference to David Fraser, hailing Fraser‚Äôs leadership as elemental to Operation Medusa‚Äôs success. In 2016, Operation Medusa was once again brought into public discussion after Fraser admitted that he believed one of the results of the battle had been counterproductive. He commented that the coalition‚Äôs attempts to remove the Taliban while attacking al-Qaeda complicated the international community‚Äôs ability to complete its mission. According to Fraser, this change in strategy left a vacuum of leadership in its wake. The Taliban consequently took root and flourished at a local level. Afghan leaders have since resumed negotiations with the Taliban in Pakistan, attesting to Fraser‚Äôs analysis. According to Fraser, Canada made a similar mistake in Libya, which has since suffered two civil wars. He urged in 2018 that the whole-of-government, multicultural approach used by Canada during Operation Medusa be applied in the upcoming peacekeeping efforts in Mali. =Operation Medusa: The Furious Battle That Saved Afghanistan from the Taliban= In collaboration with Brian Hanington, David Fraser wrote Operation Medusa: The Furious Battle That Saved Afghanistan from the Taliban, a book about his experience as the commander of this operation. It was published in 2018 and sat on The Globe and Mail Canadian Non-Fiction Bestsellers List for a number of weeks. The book offers the senior commander‚Äôs view of the political, strategic and tactical complexities of the bloodiest battle in NATO‚Äôs history. It has been described by Murray Brewster as a cautionary tale of political hubris that offered lessons for Canada‚Äôs current peacekeeping missions. Reception Reception of the book was generally positive. Brett Boudreau extolled its clear and accessible account of the battle, while Murray Brewster commented that it spoke volumes with its dignified omission of Harjit Sajjan and the ensuing controversy. The greatest acclaim was from J. Paul de B. Taillon. His article in The Dorchester Review stated that Operation Medusa should be \\"compulsory reading for junior and senior officers, politicians, bureaucrats, and academics.\\" Taillon also deemed the book a \\"corrective for those who believe that fighting or reading about the ‚Äòlast war‚Äô is of little value.\\" Awards Fraser received numerous awards during his tenure in the Canadian Armed Forces. The United States government presented him with the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star. He was also awarded several Canadian honours, such as the Commander of Military Merit award, the Meritorious Service Cross, the Vimy Award, the Atlantic Council of Canada Award and the Meritorious Service Medal.

Born in Madras (now Chennai), Chandrasekhar played for Tamil Nadu and Goa at the domestic level. Making his first-class debut in 1986 for Tamil Nadu, he went on to play for the side till 1994‚Äì95. During his period, Chandrasekhar established himself as a key player for Tamil Nadu. He was highly successful in the 1987‚Äì88 season accumulating over 551 runs. Chandrasekhar also scored heavily in the 1991‚Äì92 season and captained Tamil Nadu for a short period before playing for Goa. All in all, he scored 4,999 runs from 81 matches when he retired from first class cricket. Termed as an \\"aggressive\\" player he set the record for the fastest hundred by an Indian in first class cricket. In 2012, he was appointed as the coach of Tamil Nadu. Chandrasekhar was also a commentator and ran a cricket academy in Chennai. Playing career Chandrasekhar made his first-class debut for Tamil Nadu during the 1986/87 season. He had two equally successful domestic seasons‚Äî1987‚Äì88 and 1994‚Äì95‚Äîaggregating 551 and 572 runs respectively. He had been one of the prominent players in Tamil Nadu's Ranji Trophy victory in the former season. In the next season he scored a century off 56 balls in a match in the Irani Trophy, an Indian record in first class cricket at the time. His good performances with the bat at the domestic level earned him a place in the national side when he was chosen for the ODI team against New Zealand in December 1988. Opening the batting with Krishnamachari Srikkanth, his Tamil Nadu partner, Chandrasekhar scored 10 runs in the match which India won by four wickets. He scored his only fifty in the third match of the series; he scored 53 runs from 77 balls in the Indian victory. He was again selected for the Rothmans Cup Triangular Series in 1990 where he scored poorly. After the tournament, he was never selected for the Indian team. However, his impressive form in domestic cricket led to his being named the captain of Tamil Nadu. He continued to represent the team until 1995/96 when he started playing for Goa. His highest score of 237 not out was achieved against Kerala while playing for Goa in 1995‚Äì96; he carried his bat in a team total of 384.

Organizational history, History  Prior to 1969, police and civilian firearm and tool mark examiners regularly met during annual meetings of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) to discuss concerns specific to their field. In 1969, 35 examiners from the United States and Canada met at the Chicago Police Department Crime Laboratory and formed the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners. The first official Association publication was AFTE Newsletter Number 1, published on May 15, 1969. In 1972, the title of the publication was changed to AFTE Journal. Each year since 1969, an Annual AFTE training seminar has been held at locations throughout the United States and Canada. The primary purpose of the annual seminars is to provide for the interchange of information as it relates to all aspects of the science of firearm and tool mark identification. The fifth anniversary training seminar in Washington, D.C. in 1974 was attended by 87 individuals, representing three countries. Five years later, the seminar in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was attended by 149 examiners from seven countries. In 1980, AFTE published the AFTE Glossary. It consisted of definitions and illustrations related to the field of firearm and tool mark identification, commonly used abbreviations, various formulas for determining bullet energy and rate of spin and useful chemical formulas. A second, more comprehensive edition was published in 1982 and a third edition of the glossary was published in 1994. This edition featured material from the first two editions with additional definitions and illustrations as well as new appendices which included definitions for computer terminology, fingernail examinations (a tool mark in a biological matrix), knives, machining terms, gunshot wound terminology and shooting scene reconstruction terminology. In 1982, AFTE published an official training manual to be used as a modular guide for the training of firearm and tool mark examiners. In 1989, AFTE hosted its 20th Anniversary Annual training seminar in Virginia Beach, VA. Some 210 individuals from twelve countries attended the seminar and in 1994 the training seminar in Indianapolis, Indiana was attended by over 300 individuals from 21 countries. The current membership of AFTE includes approximately 850 members, technical advisors and subscribers that represent over 40 countries from around the world.

It defends the Catholic Church's tradition of clerical celibacy in the West. The encyclical was dated 24 June 1967. Summary of the encyclical This encyclical was written in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long-held practices. Priestly celibacy is a practice rather than required dogma, and many at the time had expected that it might be relaxed together with other practices. In response to these questions, the pope reaffirms the teaching as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church. =Discussion of arguments against priestly celibacy= Paul VI begins the encyclical by considering arguments against celibacy for the priesthood. Among these, he lists: * Those who feel called to both the priesthood and married life. * The perceived shortage of priests, and whether lifting the celibacy requirement might alleviate that. * The argument that celibacy is contrary to healthy psychological development. * Whether an acceptance of celibacy by a young priest might become much more difficult with greater maturity. =Confirmation of the law of celibacy= In response to these, Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations. Paul goes on to reaffirm the law of celibacy as something that should be continued: \\"Hence We consider that the present law of celibacy should today continue to be linked to the ecclesiastical ministry.\\" Paul VI agrees that the priestly life and the celibate life are distinguishable, but he affirms the authority of the Church's magisterium to determine the conditions under which the priesthood may be granted to its members: =Reasons for celibacy= Much of the encyclical is spent discussing reasons why Paul VI believes that celibacy in the priesthood is of value for the Church. Among these, he lists: * The model of Christ's own celibacy. As the exemplar priest, Christ's example is quite significant, and suggests a model that ought to be followed by later priests who act in his stead, and who wish to imitate his condition of life. * While marriage is to be respected as a means to holiness, Scripture testifies that celibacy is a superior means. * Celibacy as a means to love God's people without being tied down. A priest's life ought to be free so that he may better devote himself to bringing forth children of God in other ways. * Christ's own description of Heaven as a place without marriage implies that practicing celibacy now is a means to prepare for the celibate life that all share in Heaven. =Survey of celibacy in Christian tradition= History of celibacy The Pope then very briefly outlines the history of celibacy in the Church, tracing its support in the West to the 4th century. He also recalls its confirmation in later Church councils. Comparison with the Eastern Orthodox Paul VI notes that although non-celibates may be ordained as priests in the Orthodox Church, they only ordain as bishops priests who are celibates. He also mentions that in the East, once ordained as priests, men are no longer allowed to marry. =Special exceptions= While affirming the importance of celibacy as a general law in the Catholic Church, the Pope nevertheless allows that married persons who enter the Church from other traditions may in some cases be ordained as priests. He emphasizes, however, that this must not be understood as a relaxation of the law, nor as a first step to its abolition. Paul VI also expresses doubt that relaxing the law of celibacy would help increase vocations to the Catholic priesthood, by noting that it has not done so in other Christian traditions. =Defense of celibacy= The Pope john devotes much text to defending the practice of celibacy against the argument that it is contrary to human nature. The aid of grace Above all, Paul states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The Pope also cautions that a priest's celibacy should never attempt to be based on a complete ignorance or avoidance of human sexuality, an ignorance that he agrees would indeed be counter to true human nature. Rather, it should be based on a free choice based on true knowledge and understanding. Celibacy as a viable alternative to marriage Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God: Celibacy as a means to greater union with God By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life. =Considerations for priestly formation= Paul VI understands that celibacy is a difficult requirement for many, and encourages increased care to help those discerning priestly vocation to make sure that they are truly called to it: \\"Let educators appreciate that this is one of their very grave duties.\\" Paul also points out that support by others for a priest's celibate life must continue even after ordination. Paul VI emphasizes that celibacy is a serious choice, and that it must not be entered into without accompanying ascetic practices for the rest of the priest's life. Paul VI also says that before being undertaken with a solemn vow, a candidate for the priesthood ought to undergo temporary vows of celibacy before solemnly taking a permanent vow. =Dispensations from the priesthood= The Pope then turns to consider those who have decided to leave the life of priestly celibacy. He allows that inquiry may be taken concerning those who claim that their vows were taken under freedom and responsibility to see if they may be relieved of their vow. However, Paul sternly warns, =Appeal to the laity= Paul VI concludes the encyclical by appealing to the laity to pray for vocations to the priesthood and encourages their friendship with priests as a means of supporting them in their life.

It became extinct in 2015; it was the only horse breed of the Bahamas.  History  The origin of the Abaco horses is not known. It is possible that horses came ashore on Great Abaco from Spanish ships wrecked on its coasts, and also possible that horses were brought to the island by Loyalists who came there following the American Revolution. The most probable explanation is that they derived from horses used by Cuban forestry workers in the early nineteenth century. There were at one time more than two hundred of them, but the population declined rapidly in the later twentieth century as a result of human intervention and destruction of their habitat. Various conservation attempts were made, but the last horse, a mare, died in 2015. Some tissue has been preserved, which could be used for cloning.

Monbaron, D. A. Russell, and P. Taquet. (1999). Atlasaurus imelakei n.g., n.sp., a brachiosaurid-like sauropod from the Middle Jurassic of Morocco. Comptes Rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences √† Paris, Sciences de la Terre et des Plan√®tes 329:519-526. Description Restoration Atlasaurus differs from Brachiosaurus relative to the estimated length of the dorsal vertebral column (assuming 12 vertebrae, ), in having a proportionately larger skull, a shorter neck (with at least 13 cervical vertebrae, shorter and more uniform in length than Brachiosaurus), a longer tail and more elongated limbs (humerus to femur ratio: 0.99; ulna to tibia ratio: 1.15). The teeth are spoon-shaped and have denticles. The lower jaw of Atlasaurus is about long, the neck was about long, the humerus long, and the femur about long. It has been estimated at in length, and in weight. Discovery and naming Atlasaurus was described by Monbaron, Russell & Taquet in 1999. It was named after the location of discovery in the High Atlas range of the Atlas Mountains of Morocco (where the Titan Atlas was said to hold up the heavens), and for the animal's size (about long). It is known from a nearly complete skeleton with a skull found at Wawmda, in the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian-Callovian) Guettioua Formation in Morocco's Azilal Province. The type species is Atlasaurus imelakei, the specific name coming from Arabic Imelake, the name of a giant. Classification A relatively primitive sauropod identified as a \\"cetiosaur\\" when first discovered in 1981, Atlasaurus appears to be closer to Brachiosaurus than to any other known sauropod based on detailed similarities between the vertebral column and limbs. However, more recent analyses have considered it to be a putative member of the Turiasauria.

Cummins tours full-time with Umphrey's McGee, playing a range of shows each year, including sold-out performances at New York's Beacon Theatre, Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Wiltern in Los Angeles. The group also regularly performs American festivals such as Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits Festival, Electric Forest & Summer Camp Music Festival. International appearances have included Jam in the Dam in Amsterdam, Byron Bay Blues Fest in Australia and Fuji Rock Fest in Japan. Cummins, along with Brendan Bayliss, Mike Mirro and Ryan Stasik, formed the band in December 1997. Cummins and Mirro were members of University of Notre Dame band Stomper Bob, which split up around the same time as another local band, Tashi Station (which included Bayliss and Stasik). Cummins began studying classical piano more than 25 years ago and, along with several keyboards, performs with a grand piano at Umphrey's McGee concerts. In 1995, he released a solo piano album, Suspended in Time: An Epic, featuring originals such as the future Umphrey's McGee classic Orfeo and covers such as Phish's Magilla. In 2001, Cummins released an electronic keyboard-based album, Common Sense, which featured Umphrey's McGee guitarist Jake Cinninger on drums for most tracks. The band would later use two of the tracks, The Triple Wide and In Violation of Yes, in their concert repertoire. In addition to playing in Umphrey's McGee, Cummins writes and plays with a number of other bands. He is a member of progressive-rock tinged OHMphrey along with Chris Poland (Megadeth) and two members of Umphrey's McGee. Joel is a member of Digital Tape Machine, a more electronic Chicago-based group.

The highway begins at an intersection with NY 86 in the village of Lake Placid and ends at a junction with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) north of the hamlet of Underwood in the extreme southwestern corner of the town of Elizabethtown. NY 73 meanders through a mountainous region of Adirondack Park and passes by several named peaks, including Porter Mountain and Lower Wolfjaw Mountain. Along the way, the route has a short concurrency with NY 9N in the town of Keene. In the early 19th century, Lake Placid and Keene were connected by the North West Bay Road, an east‚Äìwest highway linking Hopkinton to Westport. The highway was initially a crude, impassable road; however, it was significantly improved by the state of New York in the mid-1810s. A highway linking Keene to Underwood was constructed by 1846; at Underwood, the road connected to a stagecoach road that went from Albany to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The latter road became the basis for most of modern US 9. NY 73 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York from NY 28N in Tahawus to NY 22 in Ticonderoga. The portion of the route from Tahawus to North Hudson followed the Blue Ridge Road; from North Hudson to Schroon, NY 73 overlapped US 9. At the time, modern NY 73 was designated as New York State Route 86A from Lake Placid to Keene. By the following year, the remainder of current NY 73 had become New York State Route 427. NY 73 was cut back to Schroon while NY 427 was replaced by an extended NY 86A . In 1952, NY 73 was extended northward to Lake Placid, supplanting NY 86A. The eastern terminus of NY 73 was moved to the vicinity of Underwood , and the former routing of NY 73 from Schroon to Ticonderoga became NY 74. Route description NY 73 begins at a traffic light along NY 86 near the eastern end of the village of Lake Placid in the town of North Elba. The highway heads towards the southwest, passing homes as Sentinel Road. At the intersection with Mill Pond Road, NY 73 passes a small pond, crossing over an associated creek. For that short time, the highway takes on a more southerly direction, mainly to the southeast. The surroundings of the highway remain the same as NY 73 leaves Lake Placid via Cascade Road. alt=A two-lane highway in a wooded, mountainous rural area. To the right of the highway is a sign assembly instructing drivers to turn left for NY 9N and continue straight for NY 73. NY 73 exits Lake Placid, where it passes Lake Placid Airport. There, County Route 35 (CR 35) merges from the northwest, providing a bypass around the village of Lake Placid to NY 86. Just south of North Elba, NY 73 passes the Lake Placid Olympic Ski Jumping Complex, accessible via John Brown Road (unsigned NY 910M) to nearby John Brown's Farm at the intersection with CR 35. The highway crosses the West Branch of the Ausable River, intersecting with CR 21 at an elevation of . Cascade Road makes several turns, passing south of the Craig Wood Golf Course. After the golf course, NY 73 climbs in elevation, up to . The highway turns from the southeast to the east, and to the southeast once more as it rounds Round Lake, where it intersects Bobsled Run Lane (unsigned New York State Route 913Q). The road passes Mud Pond, where it turns to the northeast along the side of a high ridge. Pitchoff Mountain is directly to the northwest as NY 73 passes Upper Cascade and Lower Cascade Lakes. alt=A two-lane highway passes through the center of a commercial and residential district. Both sides of the street are lined with business and parked cars. NY 73 begins to descend in elevation, while CR 51 splits off and NY 73 heads into Keene. After crossing the East Branch of the Ausable River, NY 73 merges in with NY 9N. The two roads continue to drop in elevation, passing and circling mountains as they head along. After Norton Cemetery, NY 9N splits off to the east and NY 73 continues southward. NY 73 now runs along the East Branch, intersecting with county and local roads as it heads southward. The highway heads along the base of Porter Mountain and into Keene Valley, crosses Johns Brook and heads through downtown. Lower Wolfjaw Mountain, which averages the same height as Porter, is nearby. NY 73 continues, eventually crossing the Ausable River branch, later coming in the towns of Elizabethtown and North Hudson. There are a few more ponds and mountains before NY 73 ends at an intersection with US 9. According to estimates made by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2009, NY 73 serves an average of 1,950 vehicles per day from US 9 to the east end of the NY 9N overlap in Keene. The overlap with NY 9N accumulated an average of 4,360 vehicles, with the stretch up to the control station at having a less amount of traffic. After NY 913Q, the average increases, peaking at 4,810 vehicles at NY 86 in Lake Placid. History =Early highways= North West Bay Road The area that is now known as the hamlet of Keene‚Äîthe modern junction of NY 9N and NY 73‚Äîwas first settled at the beginning of the 19th century. Many of the early settlers arrived in the region by traveling along a rough and nearly unusable highway connecting what became Keene to Jay in the north and Lewis in the east. By 1810, part of the crude roadway had been supplanted by a privately funded highway leading westward from Westport to at least North Elba and possibly to Saranac Lake by way of Keene. On April 5, 1810, the New York State Legislature passed an act establishing a new state highway linking Westport to Hopkinton by way of Keene and Saranac Lake. The highway incorporated the entirety of the pre-existing roadway between Westport and Saranac Lake. alt=A narrow two-lane highway runs along the base of a valley bounded on each side by many large, tree-covered mountains. Initially, the state highway was poorly constructed and largely impassable, mirroring the condition of the roadways that preceded it. An act passed by the state legislature on June 19, 1812, indicated that the funds that had been allocated to the highway were \\"entirely inadequate to open and improve\\" the road. On April 17, 1816, the state attempted to correct the issue by approving a measure that appointed two sets of commissioners to oversee the reconstruction of the highway. Each set was to work on opposite ends of the route and eventually converge at a point midway along the route. Work on the highway was completed by 1818. The road was officially named the \\"North West Bay Road\\"; however, it eventually became known as the \\"Old Military Road\\". The route did not enter the village of Lake Placid; instead, it bypassed it to the southwest. This portion of the highway is still known today by the latter name. Other highways The highway through Keene Valley from Underwood to Keene was built by 1846. At its southern end, it connected to a major stagecoach road that connected Albany to the Canadian border. The route fostered the rise of local lumber and tanning industries; up to 40 wagon loads of timber used the stagecoach route daily. Various hotels and taverns opened in the nearby town of North Hudson to serve travelers along the route. =State ownership and designations= In 1909, the state of New York began to take control of many private highways across the state under the terms of the new highway law developed in 1908. One of these highways was the old north‚Äìsouth stagecoach road from Albany to Canada. Most of the highway north of modern NY 8 in Chester became the northern half of Route 22, an unsigned legislative route, under the text of the highway law. In 1913, the New York State Legislature created Route 22-b, a spur route connecting Route 22 in Schroon to the then-village of Ticonderoga. On March 1, 1921, Route 22-b became part of Route 48, a new route created as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. The path of the former Albany‚ÄìCanada stagecoach route was largely designated as US 9 in 1927. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. alt=An intersection of a pair of highways in a wooded rural area. In the foreground is a sign assembly reading \\"End NY 74\\"; in the foreground is a second assembly indicating that Interstate 87 is straight ahead and US 9 is accessed by turning either left or right. NY 73 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern routing. It began at an intersection with NY 28N in Tahawus and followed the Blue Ridge Road east to US 9 in North Hudson. From there, it overlapped US 9 south to Schroon, where it proceeded eastward on the former legislative Route 48 to Ticonderoga, where it ended at a junction with NY 22. At the time, modern NY 73 from Lake Placid to Keene‚Äîidentical to the old North West Bay Road east of the Lake Placid area‚Äîwas assigned NY 86A. The remainder of what is now NY 73 from Keene south to Underwood was designated as NY 427 within a year's time.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering The portion of NY 73 between Tahawus and North Hudson was removed from the state highway system . As a result, NY 73 was truncated to a new western terminus at US 9 in Schroon, eliminating the concurrency with US 9. To the north, NY 427 was supplanted by an extended NY 86A . In November 1952, NY 73 was extended eastward through Ticonderoga to the ferry dock on Lake Champlain, where it connected to the Fort Ticonderoga‚ÄìLarrabees Point Ferry. The change supplanted NY 347, a short spur route off NY 22 that had been in place since . A month earlier, NY 73 was extended northward to Lake Placid via Underwood and Keene, replacing NY 86A and overlapping US 9 from Severance to Underwood. NY 73 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Underwood , eliminating the overlap with US 9. Its former routing from Schroon to Lake Champlain was renumbered to NY 74. alt=A two-lane highway in a forested area. To the right of the highway is a sign indicating that a hill is ahead. In the distance is a large mountain completely covered with trees. On September 14, 1994, the state of New York signed a proposal to turn NY 73 into a scenic byway into law. The byway, known as the \\"High Peaks Scenic Byway\\", begins at the western terminus of NY 73 in Lake Placid and follows NY 73 and US 9 to Interstate 87 exit 30. In December 1994, the group Scenic America designated the highway as one of the ten most scenic areas in the nation. Future In 2009, NYSDOT has made plans to repair seven bridges along NY 73. The seven projects will cost the state an estimated $11.1 million (equivalent to $ in ) and are tentatively scheduled to begin at various times between 2013 and 2016. The $11 million cost includes $4.3 million for two bridges over the West Branch of the Ausable River that were built in 1932, $1.3 million for a bridge over the Southern Fork of the Bouquet River in Keene, $2.6 million for two bridges over Beede Brook that were built in 1935 and 1936, $1.3 million for a bridge over the outlet of Lower Cascade Lake, and $1.6 million for a bridge over Johns Brook.

The angle of incidence, Œ±, is close to the critical angle for the sample. The beam is diffracted in the plane of the surface of the sample by the angle 2Œ∏. Grazing incidence X-ray and neutron diffraction (GID, GIXD, GIND), typically from a crystalline structure uses small incident angles for the incoming X-ray or neutron beam, so that diffraction can be made surface sensitive. It is used to study surfaces and layers because wave penetration is limited. Distances are in the order of nanometres. Below (typically 80%) the critical angle of the surface material studied an evanescent wave is established for a short distance and is exponentially damped. Therefore, Bragg reflections are only coming from the surface structure. An advantage of GIXD is that the electric field at the critical angle is amplified locally by a factor of four, making the signal stronger. A disadvantage is the limited in-plane spatial resolution (beam footprint). When very small scattering angles are being studied, the technique is called grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS, GISAXS, GISANS), and requires special methodology.

Zemlya) is a 1930 Soviet film by Ukrainian director Alexander Dovzhenko, concerning the process of collectivization and the hostility of Kulak landowners. It is Part 3 of Dovzhenko's \\"Ukraine Trilogy\\" (along with Zvenigora and Arsenal). Earth is regarded as Dovzhenko's masterpiece. Plot The film begins with the final moments of grandfather Semyon (Simon) Opanas beneath a pear tree.Philosophy, Iconology, Collectivization: Earth (1930) Next local kulaks, including Arkhyp Bilokin, contemplate the process of collectivization and declare their resistance to it, while elsewhere Semyon's grandson Vasyl (Basil) and his Komsomol friends also meet to discuss collectivization, although his father is skeptical. Later, Vasyl arrives with the community's first tractor to much excitement. After the men urinate in the overheated radiator, the peasants plow the land with the tractor and harvest the grain. A montage sequence presents the production of bread from beginning to end. That night Vasyl dances a hopak along a path on his way home, but a dark figure attacks and kills him. Vasyl's father turns away the Russian Orthodox priest who expects to lead the funeral, declaring his atheism. He asks Vasyl's friends to bury his son in a new way without priests and \\"sing new songs for a new life.\\" The villagers do so, while Vasyl's fianc√©e, Natalya, mourns him painfully and the local priest curses them as impious and paganist. At the cemetery, Bilokin's son Khoma (Thomas) arrives in a frenzy to declare that he will resist collectivization and that he was the one who killed Vasyl, but the villagers pay him no attention. One declares that Vasyl's glory will fly around the world like a new communist airplane. The film ends with a downpour of rain over fruit and vegetables.

Umanets *Ye. Bondina *Luka Lyashenko as Young Kulak Production =Background= The political and historic events of Earth and the agricultural developments of Dovzhenko's home country of Soviet Ukraine was a hot topic during the film's production and laid the foundation of the controversy that the film's release caused. In 1906, Tsar Nicholas II had allowed peasants to own private land, which they then passed down through the generations. After the October Revolution in 1917, these peasants in Ukraine wanted to keep their family land and farms and the Soviet government tolerated them under Vladimir Lenin's New Economic Policy. After the grain shortages in the late 1920s, Joseph Stalin decided that it was necessary to eliminate \\"rural capitalism\\" in these regions and take control of the farming industry in 1929. Stalin stated \\"We must smash the Kulaks, eliminate them as a class.\\" Some of the land-owning peasants fought back and began to sabotage agricultural machines. The local Kulaks were more militant and committed violent acts against Soviet officials. Most Ukrainians wanted to keep their private land, especially since compared to many other parts of Russia their land was agriculturally rich and fertile. In the middle of the political conflict surrounding this topic, Dovzhenko made a lyrical and poetic film depicting the lives of Ukrainian farmers that many Soviet officials considered completely inappropriate.Kepley, p. 78. =Writing and production= Dovzhenko wrote the original scenario for Earth in 1929 in response to the newfound collectivisation of small villages in Ukraine, which he described as \\"a period not only of economic transformation but also of mental transformation of the whole people.\\" He based the character of Semyon on his own grandfatherKepley, p. 4. and the murder of Vasyl on the assassination of a Soviet agent by Kulaks in his own home district.Kepley, p. 76. Dovzhenko also included the generational differences between older and younger Soviet citizens and the \\"changing-of-consciousness\\" necessary to accept the new regime as a theme in the film. This is demonstrated in the juxtapositon between Vasyl, who wholeheartedly accepts the new collectivization initiatives and the motorized tractor as a way to harvest crops more quickly and efficiently; and his father, who is skeptical about Communism and stubbornly continues to use a ox- driven plow. The changing of consciousness occurs when Vasyl is murdered and his father turns away the priest in favor of an areligious funeral. Communism is also linked with progress and modernity in this film, such as with the depiction of the arrival of the tractor and the invocation of a Communist- built airplane at the funeral. This was Dovzhenko's first film with Kiev Studios after having impressed both critics and the Soviet government with his first two films. He once again used cinematographer and collaborator Danylo Demutsky on this film.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company, 1987. p. 262. The film was mostly shot in the Poltava Oblast of Ukraine. When shooting Vasyl's dance celebrating the success of the harvest, the scene was originally scripted as a Cossack-style hopak but Semen Svashenko altered it based on advice from local Ukrainian farmers. Dovzhenko later adapted the film into a novelization and published the completed scenario in 1952.Dovzhenko, p. 58. In Ukrainian and Russian, the title \\"Zemlia\\" translates to \\"earth\\" in the sense of soil, land or ground.Kepley, p. 79.  Reception  =Initial= Earth received very positive reviews. Earth was simultaneously lauded and derided by Soviet authorities due to its fairly ambiguous political message on such a controversial political subject. It first premiered in Kharkiv, Ukraine in the spring of 1930 during an event held to honor the local Dovzhenko. The film was an immense success and received a standing ovation.Kepley, p. 75. This was the only occasion during its initial release that Earth was praised and afterwards it was criticized by Soviet journalists. One critic called it \\"ideologically vicious\\" and some Communist Party officials accused Dovzhenko of wasting public funds on the film. Pravda praised the film's visual style but claimed it had a false political message. The official spokesman for the Red Army officially endorsed the film. Soviet communist artist Demyan Bedny called the film \\"counterrevolutionary\\" and \\"defeatist\\".Wakeman, p. 263. Bedny was known as \\"The Kremlin Poet\\" and was also a personal friend of Joseph Stalin. He publicly criticized the film in the form of a satirical poem that appeared in Izvestia in which he stated that the film naively took a philosophical attitude towards political reality. The film was severely cut by the Soviet government. Dovzhenko was so upset by the negative reaction to the film that, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he left Ukraine and traveled throughout Europe screening his films and experimenting with newly developed sound equipment available in western Europe.Kepley, p. 85. Film critic C. A. Lejeune praised the film's main section, saying that it \\"contains perhaps more understanding of pure beauty in cinema, more validity of relation in moving image, than any ten minutes of production yet known to the screen.\\"Wakeman, p. 262. Lewis Jacobs compared Dovzhenko's work to Eisenstein and Pudovkin, stating that Dovzhenko \\"had added a deep personal and poetic insight...[his films] are laconic in style, with a strange, wonderfully imaginative quality difficult to describe.\\" Film director Grigori Roshal praised the film, he wrote \\"Neither Eisenstein nor Pudovkin have achieved the tenderness and warmth in speaking about men and the world that Alexander Dovzhenko has revealed. Dovzhenko is always experimental. He is always an innovator and always a poet.\\" The film was voted one of the twelve greatest films of all time by a group of 117 film historians at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair and named one of the top ten greatest films of all time by the International Film Critics Symposium. =Legacy= Earth is usually considered Dovzhenko's best film, and is often cited alongside Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin (1925) as one of the most important films of the Soviet era. Dovzhenko's biographer Marco Carynnyk lauded the film's \\"passionate simplicity...which has made it a masterpiece of world cinema\\" and praised its \\"powerful lyric affirmation of life.\\"Wakeman, p. 626. It was ranked #88 in the 1995 Centenary Poll of the 100 Best Films of the Century in Time Out magazine. The work also received 10 critics' votes in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the world's greatest films. In the British Film Institute page for Earth, it is noted that the plot \\"is secondary to the extraordinarily potent images of wheatfields, ripe fruit and weatherbeaten faces [‚Ä¶] Terrence Malick‚Äôs Days of Heaven (1978) is in a similar rhapsodic tradition.\\" The original negative for the film was destroyed by a Nazi German air raid in the First Battle of Kiev during Operation Barbarossa in 1941. The incident is considered to be a great loss of cultural heritage among film scholars.

Those who organized the congregation in 1885 were part of a substantial wave of Romanian-Jewish immigrants, most of whom settled in the Lower East Side. The Rivington Street building, built around 1860, had previously been a church, then a synagogue, then a church again, and had been extensively remodeled in 1889. It was transformed into a synagogue for a second time when the First Roumanian-American congregation purchased it in 1902 and again remodeled it. The synagogue became famous as the \\"Cantor's Carnegie Hall\\", because of its high ceiling, good acoustics, and seating for up to 1,800 people. Yossele Rosenblatt, Moshe Koussevitzky, Zavel Kwartin, Moishe Oysher, Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker were all cantors there. Red Buttons sang in the choir, George Burns was a member, and Edward G. Robinson had his Bar Mitzvah there. The congregation's membership was in the thousands in the 1940s, but by the early 2000s had declined to around 40, as Jews moved out of the Lower East Side. Though its building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, the congregation was reluctant to accept outside assistance in maintaining it. In December 2005, water damage was found in the structural beams, and services were moved to the living room of the rabbi's mother. In January 2006, the synagogue's roof collapsed, and the building was demolished two months later. Origins =First Roumanian- American/Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim= From 1881 through 1914, approximately 2 million Jews immigrated to the United States from Europe. An estimated three-quarters of them settled in New York City, primarily in the Lower East Side.Dolkart (1997), Section 8, p. 3, citing Binder & Reimers (1995), p. 114. Over 75,000 of these immigrants were from Romania, where Jews faced antisemitic laws, violence and expulsion. These hardships, combined with low crop yields and economic depression, resulted in 30 percent of the Jews in Romania emigrating to the United States.Dolkart (1997), Section 8, pp. 3‚Äì4. Romanian Jewish immigrants in New York City gravitated to a fifteen-block area bounded by Allen, Ludlow, Houston and Grand streets. This \\"Romanian quarter\\" became the most densely populated part of the Lower East Side, with 1,500 to 1,800 people per block.Jones (2005), p. 3. These immigrants founded the First Roumanian-American congregation, also known as Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim.Epstein (2007), p. 182. The origins of the congregation are disputed;Diner, Shandler, Wenger (2000), p. 125. \\"The synagogue is the First Roumanian-American Congregation, whose congregational origins remain in dispute, but whose physical presence is undeniable.\\" its establishment in 1885 may have been a re-organization of a congregation founded in 1860. Located initially close to the Romanian quarter at 70 Hester Street, and later situated at the heart of it with the move to Rivington Street, the synagogue was the preferred house of worship for the quarter's inhabitants. =Rivington Street building= The Rivington Street building was constructed as a Protestant church around 1860 by the Second Reformed Presbyterian Church,Dolkart (1997), Section 8, p. 1. which served the area's large German immigrant community. In November 1864 the building was sold to the Orthodox German-Jewish Congregation Shaaray Hashomayim (\\"Gates of the Heavens\\"), which had been founded in 1841. Though its Hebrew name was essentially the same as that used by the First Roumanian-American congregation‚ÄîCongregation Shaarey Shamoyim‚Äîwhich later purchased the building in 1902, the two congregations were unrelated.Dolkart (1997), Section 8, p. 7. By the late 1880s, the German- Jewish community had mostly moved from the Lower East Side. In 1889, Congregation Shaaray Hashomayim moved to 216 East 15th Street, near Second Avenue, selling the Rivington Street building to the New York City Church Extension and Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which built or purchased churches, missions, and Sunday schools in New York City.Dolkart (1997), Section 8, pp. 1‚Äì2. The Church Extension and Missionary Society engaged J. Cleaveland Cady to design major alterations to the structure. Cady was, at the time, New York's most famous church architect, and had designed many other public institutional buildings, including university buildings, hospitals and museums. His work included the original Metropolitan Opera building (since demolished), the Richardsonian Romanesque West 78th Street wing of the American Museum of Natural History, and several other buildings for the Church Extension and Missionary Society. The renovations cost approximately $36,000 (today $), and included an entirely new Romanesque Revival facade in the reddish-orange brick that Cady also used on several other churches.Dolkart (1997), Section 8, pp. 2‚Äì3. Renamed the Allen Street Methodist Episcopal Church (or Allen Street Memorial Church), the Rivington Street building's new purpose was to \\"attract Jewish immigrants seeking conversion\\". It was, however, unsuccessful in this endeavor. In 1895, the church's pastor stated, \\"The existence of the church here attracts few. Our audiences are small, and contain almost no Jews.\\"Dolkart (1997), Section 8, p. 3, citing the Report of the New York City Church Extension and Missionary Society (1895), p. 29. Purchase and renovation by First Roumanian-American In 1902, the First Roumanian-American congregation/Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim purchased the Rivington Street building from the Church Extension and Missionary Society to satisfy a need for a larger building to serve the Lower East Side's rapidly growing Romanian-Jewish population.Dolkart (1997), Section 8, p. 4. At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $).The New York Times, April 26, 1902, p. 14. The funds for the purchase were raised from the members of the congregation, and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary. The most generous gift was $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay.Bastable (2004). The congregation also took out two mortgages; one for $50,000 (today $) with the Title Insurance Company, and a second for $30,000 (today $) with the Church Extension and Missionary Society. The congregation commissioned Charles E. Reid for extensive renovations, at a cost of $6,000 (today $).The New York Times, June 22, 1902, p. 19. The \\"eclectic Byzantine\\"Dolkart (1997), Section 8, p. 5. remodeling involved converting it for Jewish use by removing Christian symbols and adding a Torah ark and bimah (central platform from which the Torah is read) at the sanctuary's north end. The renovations retained the original \\"horseshoe-shaped gallery supported by twelve Ionic columns\\" and wooden pews with reading shelves (likely from the 1889 Cady renovation),Dolkart (1997), Section 7, p. 3. but a number of structural changes were made. Steel beams were added to support the weight of the ark and bimah, the rear wall was re-built and the gallery extended to meet it, two skylights were added (a concave stained glass one and a clear glass one over the ark), and at the front of the building, on top of the shallow (14 feet deep) fourth-story attic, an equally shallow fifth-story attic was added. The completed structure filled almost the entire width of its approximately by lot,Mark (March 10, 2006).Dolkart (1997), Section 7, p. 1. and seated 1,600 to 1,800. Dedicated in late December 1902, it was the Lower East Side's largest synagogueEpstein (2007), p. 183 and only Romanesque one,Gelfand (1992). and it became an \\"architectural and public showpiece\\".Weissman Joselit (1990), p. 5. Early activities By 1903 the synagogue was well established on Rivington Street, and, due to its capacity and prominence, was often the site of significant or mass meetings. In April 1903 a service to honor the memory of Reform rabbi and Zionist leader Gustav Gottheil was held there,The New York Times, April 29, 1903, p. 9. and a similar service was held for Theodore Herzl the following year. At the latter service, which was boycotted by Orthodox rabbis, Herzl was not eulogized, nor was his name mentioned.The New York Times, July 8, 1904, p. 9. The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (UOJCA) held its third annual convention at the synagogue in June 1903, attended by around 100 delegates, and presided over by the organization's president, Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes. The most important resolutions adopted at that meeting were one that deprecated the granting of a get (religious divorce document) to‚Äîor allowing subsequent re-marriage by‚Äîpeople who had not first obtained a civil divorce, and the request that congregations with mostly foreign-born members \\"secure an English-speaking rabbi for the benefit of their American-born English-speaking children\\". Pereira Mendes spoke in favor of the creation of a committee to bring victims of the Kishinev pogrom to the United States, and against a proposal by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) that the Jewish Sabbath be moved to Sunday. Pereira Mendes also announced that the UOJCA would \\"unite\\" with the UAHC and other national \\"religious, philanthropic, or educational\\" Jewish organizations in Washington \\"to discuss the subjects of vital concern to Judaism and Jews\\", while rejecting the proposition that \\"the main topic of the discussion at the first congress shall be the immigration problem.\\"The New York Times, June 22, 1903, p. 12. At the meeting Albert Lucas also spoke out strongly against attempts by Christian groups to proselytize Jewish children in nurseries and kindergartens. Ostensibly to combat this proselytization, in 1903 the congregation was one of several New York City synagogues that allowed Lucas the use of its premises for free religious classes, \\"open to all children of the neighborhood\\".See Kaufman (1999), p. 142, and the American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 7, p. 85. In December 1905 a mass meeting was held at the synagogue to protest massacres of Jews in Russia and mourn their deaths,The New York Times, December 11, 1905, p. 2. and the congregation donated $500 to a fund for the sufferers.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 8, p. 194. In March 1909 Orthodox groups held meetings there to organize opposition to the constitution and make-up of Judah Leon Magnes's Kehilla, an overarching organization intended to represent all of New York's Jews, which lasted until 1922.The New York Times, March 28, 1909, p. 11. A mass meeting of local residents and businessmen to combat Lower East Side gangsters was held at the synagogue in 1913.The New York Times, September 1, 1913, p. 14. The Rivington Street synagogue was also a preferred venue for airing issues relevant specifically to Romanian-American Jews. In 1905 it was the site of New York City's only memorial service honoring United States Secretary of State John Hay, who had worked on behalf of oppressed Jews in Romania.The New York Times, July 10, 1905, p. 7. In 1908, the synagogue hosted a meeting of over 30 religious organizations representing Romanian-American Jews, at which the formation of a federation of those organizations was proposed,The New York Times, March 30, 1908, p. 6. and again in 1916 hosted a similar meeting of \\"two hundred delegates representing thirty-five organizations ... to plan incorporation of the American League of Rumanian Jews\\".The New York Times, September 18, 1916, p. 8. At the latter meeting steps were taken to raise $1,000,000 (today $) for oppressed Jews in Romania, and to campaign for their \\"equal rights and their emancipation from thralldom\\". The congregation carried out extensive charity campaigns during the Passover season; by 1905 the congregation was distributing wagon-loads of matzos to poor Jews so they could celebrate the holiday.The New York Times, April 16, 1905, p. 9. By 1907‚Äì1908 membership had risen to 500American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 9, p. 302. (up from 160 in 1900),American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 2, p. 364. the Talmud Torah had 250 students, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $25,000 (today $). The congregation ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908, and in October of that year raised funds by selling a number of its Torah scrolls in a public auction.The Forward, October 10, 2008. Members who would become famous included George BurnsSee Jacobs (1996), Bastable (2004), Zakrzewski (2006) and Epstein (2007), p. 183. and Bucharest-born Edward G. Robinson, who had his Bar Mitzvah there in 1906.Epstein (2007), p. 249.Gansberg (1983), p. 11. Robinson would later laugh that his propensity for taking the stage was demonstrated when he gave the longest Bar Mitzvah speech in the history of the congregation‚Äî\\"but the men sat still and listened\\". In 1911 First Roumanian- American celebrated its ten-year jubilee at the synagogue. Guest speakers included United Synagogue of America president Solomon Schechter, Congressman Henry M. Goldfogle, and the principal speaker was William Jay Gaynor, then Mayor of New York City.The New York Times, December 18, 1911, p. 20. Membership had grown to 350 families by 1919. The congregational school held classes daily, and had 4 teachers and 300 students. The American Jewish Year Book listed the synagogue's rabbi as Abraham Frachtenberg, a well-known cantor.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 21, p. 477. \\"Cantor's Carnegie Hall\\" The synagogue's sanctuary had a high ceiling and \\"opera house\\" characteristics,Lueck (January 24, 2006). and was renowned for its \\"exquisite\\"Barry (2006). or \\"magnificent\\" acoustics. Known as \\"the Cantor's Carnegie Hall\\", First Roumanian-American became a center for cantorial music, and many of the greatest cantors of the 20th century led services there. Yossele Rosenblatt, Moshe Koussevitzky, Zavel Kwartin and Moishe Oysher all sang there, as did Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker before they became famous opera singers. Having a reputation for good cantorial singing had a positive impact on a synagogue's finances; congregations depended on the funds from the sale of tickets for seats on the High Holy Days, and the better the cantor, the greater the attendance.Dunlap (2004), p. 78. Red Buttons sang at the synagogue with Rosenblatt in 1927, and when visiting the synagogue almost 70 years later could still remember the songs. Though his family actually went to a \\"small storefront synagogue\\", Buttons was discovered, at age eight, by a talent scout for Rosenblatt's Coopermans Choir, who heard him singing near the intersection of Fifth Street and Avenue C, at a \\"pickle stand\\". Buttons would sing in the choir for three years.Green (1995), p. B.04. Eddie Cantor has also been claimed as a choir member,Jacobs (1996).Lueck and Moynihan (2006). though this is less likely. Oysher‚Äî\\"the greatest of all popularizers of cantorial singing\\"Sanders (1980), p. 36.‚Äîbecame the synagogue's cantor in 1935,Shandler (2009), p. 36. and the congregation's membership peaked in the 1940s, when it numbered in the thousands.Vitullo-Martin (2006), In a 1956 interview by Brendan Gill in The New Yorker magazine, Oysher described First Roumanian- American as \\"the most orthodox Orthodox synagogue in town\\".Gill (1956), p. 18. Oysher died of a heart attack two years later \\"at the young age of 51\\".The Forward, November 2008. The week of his death, he had said, \\"half-jokingly\\", that he wanted only one person to deliver his eulogy: Chaim Porille, rabbi of the First Roumanian-American Congregation. Porille had been born in U≈õcieczko (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1898, and moved to the United States in 1927, to serve as rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of Providence, Rhode Island. He became rabbi of First Roumanian-American in 1932, a post he filled until 1962, and was a member of the executive board of the Agudath Harabonim. He died in September 1968. Subsequent building renovations and appearance in the 1990s alt=A five-story square building directly abuts a sidewalk. The facade is reddish brick, with two square windows on the second and three arched windows on the third floor. The main entrance juts forward from the facade, and is topped by an arch. In the years following First Roumanian- American's initial purchase and renovation of the Rivington Street building, the congregation made a number of other structural alterations. These included: *1916‚Äì1917: Adding fire escapes on the east and west sides of the building. *1920s or later: Installing individual theatre-style seats in the gallery.Dolkart (1997), Section 7, p. 4. *1938‚Äì1943: Removing the staircase to the fourth floor, leaving access only from the fire escapes. *1948‚Äì1950: Reconstructing the portico with some of the existing stone and brick, and adding new \\"fireproof steel stairs with terrazzo treads\\" and light-yellow and blue tinted glass windows on the east and west walls of the sanctuary, and other improvements.Including new toilets. *1964: Adding a kitchen to the basement \\"for social purposes\\". In the 1990s, the north-facing orange-red brick facade presented a large, compound arched brick and stone portico, with deeply recessed doors. This arch was \\"supported by three carved columns, two twisted columns, and a central column with a chevron pattern, each with a Byzantine-style capital\\", and had a stone coping on top.Dolkart (1997), Section 7, p. 2. Carved into the portico arch in capital letters were the words \\"First Roumanian-American Congregation\\". Originally there were large rectangular window openings on the ground floor on each side of the portico, each divided into two windows, but these had been bricked in by the 1990s. The second- and third-floor windows above them were originally stained glass but later clear glass, each second-floor window having eight square panes, and each third-floor window six panes topped with an arch. \\"Ornamental red terra cotta panels\\" separated the second- and third-floor openings. On the third floor, centered above the portico, was a similar window, this one flanked by two short recessed twisted columns, each \\"supporting a stone lintel incised with a cupid's-bow ornament\\". Similar lintels capped three-story pilasters at each corner of the facade, and these pilasters and lintels extended around the northeast and northwest corners. The six-paned windows were each capped with a roundel and three spandrels, \\"two large and one small\\", and these retained their original stained glass. The shallow fourth floor was demarcated on the bottom by \\"a heavy frieze and corbelled brick cornice\\", which supported \\"eight round-arched windows with molded brick voussoirs ... massed in a 3-2-3 pattern\\". By the 1990s these had also been bricked in. The attic on top of the fourth floor, added during the 1902‚Äì1903 renovations, was \\"capped by a band of small red terra-cotta blocks\\". The sides of the building were faced with plain brick, and flanked by narrow alleys with iron gates at each entrance. The walls generally had plain windows, though there was a round arched one on each side of the fourth floor. One fire escape remained, in the east alley. Inside, the building held a two-story balconied main sanctuary and dining room, in addition to the basement kitchen and bathrooms. The heating system was in a sub-basement. The front ark and wood bimah in the sanctuary were ornate; the red velvet draped ark was elaborately decorated, and the bimah was also decorated, and supported a large bronze candelabra.Dolkart (1997), Section 7, pp. 3‚Äì4. The sanctuary floor was wood, with wood wainscoting and plaster walls. =Appearances in popular culture= The synagogue building can be seen in the 1956 film Singing in the Dark, starring Oysher, and also starring (and produced by) Joey Adams.Singing in the Dark, National Center for Jewish Film website. Retrieved September 15, 2009. The entrance can be seen in the panoramic photograph of the corner of Ludlow and Rivington streets found on the Beastie Boys' 1989 Paul's Boutique album cover foldout,See The New York Observer, January 23, 2006, Carlson (2006). and the building (and Jacob Spiegel) can also be seen in Raphael Nadjari's 2001 film I Am Josh Polonski's Brother. Decline Over time the synagogue appealed to a broader constituency than just Roumanian-American Jews.Wolfe (2003), pp. 171‚Äì172. Nevertheless, membership declined during the latter half of the 20th century as the upwardly mobile Jewish population of the Lower East Side moved to north Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. First Roumanian-American was particularly affected: as it was an Orthodox congregation, in order to attend Sabbath services its members had to live within walking distance. In 1980 First Roumanian-American was one of the few congregations on the Lower East Side to still have its own Talmud Torah. This school had been housed in a small building on the east side of the synagogue that had formerly served as the church rectory. The congregation was eventually forced to sell the building, but the new owners retained the school's carved sign. Rabbi Mordecai Mayer, who had led the congregation for 20 years, died in 1981, two days before his 66th birthday.The New York Times, January 31, 1981.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 83, p. 359. Born in Chortkov (then in Poland), he had graduated from the Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva, and had emigrated to the United States in 1936.Lieblich, Part 1. He had, for 40 years, conducted programs on Jewish topics on radio station WEVD, then owned by The Forward. In the 1970s he was a columnist for the Yiddish weekly Algemeiner Journal, and was the author of the English-language books Israel's Wisdom in Modern Life (1949) and Seeing Through Believing (1973). He was succeeded by Jacob Spiegel.Anderson (January 27 ‚Äì February 2, 2006). In the early 1990s the congregation could still be assured of the required quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the morning and evening prayers before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary had become too expensive to maintain. With the decline in membership, the building deteriorated. In 1997 the congregation received a grant for preservation and repair of the structure from the New York Landmarks Conservancy,Chen (1997). and the following year received $4,000 from the Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program for roof truss repairs.Daily News (New York), June 29, 1998.Jewish Heritage Report, Spring‚ÄìSummer 1998. That same year the synagogue building was listed in the National Register of Historic PlacesNRHP Weekly List: 3/09/98 through 3/13/98. at the local level.Dolkart (1997), p. 1. In the fall of that year Shimon Attie's laser visual work Between Dreams and History was projected onto the synagogue and neighboring buildings for three weeks.Apel (2002), pp. 69‚Äì70. Spiegel had a heart attack and died in 2001, leaving charge of the synagogue to the youngest of his three sons, Rabbi Shmuel Spiegel. The other sons, Rabbi Gershon and Rabbi Ari, were, respectively, synagogue president and assistant rabbi. In June 2003 the name \\"Rabbi Yaakov Spiegel Way\\" was given collectively to the corner of Rivington Street and Ludlow Street near the synagogue location and the stretch of Rivington in front of the synagogue.The Villager, June 11‚Äì17, 2003. The roof had long been in bad shape by the time of Jacob Spiegel's death in 2001 and it was threatening to collapse. In December of that year, Shmuel Spiegel managed to raise $25,000 for emergency repairs. However, despite offering cholent (the traditional Sabbath lunch stew) at the Sabbath morning kiddush, Spiegel had to search local streets to make the ten men for the minyan.See Sheraton (2002) and Salkin (2002), p. 2. In 2004 the regular membership hovered around 40. Spiegel kept the synagogue running at an annual cost of around $75,000. Collapse alt=A building is surrounded on the first floor by plywood hoarding. The second and third floors are partially open to the street, and the interior can be seen. Part of the roof has also been torn away, and the joists and trusses are exposed. On January 22, 2006, the roof of the synagogue caved in, severely damaging the main sanctuary. Joshua Cohen, writing in The Forward in 2008, described the roof as \\"falling in respectfully, careful not to disturb the local nightclubs, or the wine and cheesery newly opened across the street\\".Cohen (2008). No one was injured,Mark (January 27, 2006). and a party to celebrate that fact was later held at the Chasam Sopher Synagogue on Clinton Street.Levin (2006). The National Trust for Historic Preservation issued a press release about the collapse, in which it described \\"older religious properties, like the First Roumanian-American Synagogue\\" as \\"national treasures\\", and stated: > The roof collapse at First Roumanian‚ÄìAmerican Synagogue this week > demonstrates that houses of worship must have access to necessary technical > assistance, staff and board training, and the development of new funding > sources in order to save these landmarks of spirituality, cultural > tradition, and community service.National Trust for Historic Preservation, > January 27, 2006. Amy Waterman, executive director of a project to repair and renovate the Eldridge Street Synagogue, noted in The Forward: > Synagogues like the First Roumanian-American Congregation, more familiarly > known as the Rumanische shul, were the first spiritual homes for successive > waves of European immigrants. They were built more than 100 years ago, and > just like the bridges and tunnels of New York City, they're bound to fail if > not attended to.Waterman (2006). Though First Roumanian-American had hosted a wedding as recently as October 30, 2005, the sanctuary had not been in regular use for over 10 years as a result of the difficulty maintaining it. Services had been held instead on a lower floor, and by autumn 2005 the roof was so porous that on Yom Kippur‚Äîeven in the basement‚Äîthey prayed \\"with buckets\\". After a contractor found water damage in the ceiling beams in early December, the three Spiegel brothers had been holding services in their mother Chana's apartment at 383 Grand Street,Spitz (2006). where they placed the congregation's 15 Torah scrolls following the roof cave-in.Mark (February 10, 2006). The synagogue's historic ark was also retrieved from the ruins.Anderson (March 29 ‚Äì April 4, 2006). According to Shmuel Spiegel, \\"the insurance company [was] playing hardball.\\" Because the building had never been registered as a National Historic Landmark, after the collapse it was demolished on March 3, 2006.Lueck (March 7, 2006). The New York City Department of Buildings said that the decision to demolish was the congregation's, but congregational vice president Joshua Shainberg said the Department of Buildings had left them no choice: \\"The Department of Buildings told us, 'You are to demolish it or we are to demolish it.' There were figures of up to $1.5 million for demolition.\\" At the time of the building's collapse, the Spiegel brothers vowed that it would be re-built, but not nearly as large: \\"perhaps 20 feet high by 60 feet deep by 75 feet wide, which would cost about $2 million to $3 million\\". Richard Price described the collapsed building in his novel Lush Life, writing that, after the demolition, only the rear wall with a Star of David in stained glass remained:McGrath (2008). \\"The candlesticks were standing up in the rubble, and the whole place looked like an experimental stage set‚Äîlike Shakespeare in the Park.\\" By October 2007 all that was left was \\"an empty lot dotted with weeds and crushed bricks\\".Austerlitz (2007). In a 2008 addendum to his book Dough: A Memoir, Mort Zachter described the remains as \\"a multimillion dollar real estate opportunity masquerading as a vacant, weed-strewn lot\\". Controversy The collapse of the roof, and subsequent destruction of the synagogue, generated widespread concern and criticism among preservationists, who blamed Jacob and Shmuel Spiegel‚Äîa charge the family rejected.Goldman (2006). alt=Stones over a doorway arch with the incomplete name \\"Roumanian-American Cong\\" in carved capital letters. Beneath, carved into the lintel, are the words \\"Talmud Torah\\", also in capital letters. The two surround a carving of two tablets with Hebrew writing, representing the Ten Commandments. Julia Vitullo-Martin, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and director of its Center for Rethinking Development, stated that First Roumanian-American's roof collapse and subsequent destruction dramatized an \\"ongoing though undocumented synagogue crisis‚Äîparticularly in poor neighborhoods\\" and revealed a broader problem peculiar to Jewish houses of worship: In the years preceding the building's collapse, the congregation had received offers of assistance from the New York Landmarks Conservancy, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Lower East Side Conservancy, and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, though reports on the amounts and types of assistance offered varied. The congregation, then under the leadership of Jacob Spiegel, rejected them. Joel Kaplan of the Lower East Side Conservancy stated that the congregation \\"didn't want the several hundred thousand dollars in landmarking grants that went to other Lower East shuls, money that could have kept the shul in repair\\". The reasons given for this rejection also varied. According to Vitullo-Martin, writing in The Wall Street Journal, Shmuel Spiegel was not sure why the offers were rejected, as the records were \\"buried in the rubble\\". Vitullo-Martin speculated that congregants might have hesitated to agree to a condition that they would need permission from the state for any sale or alteration of the building during the following 20 years. According to The New York Times, Spiegel stated that the repairs required were so extensive that the congregation could not have made them even with this financial assistance. According to The Jewish Week, Spiegel stated that the congregation \\"didn't want outside interference\\", was \\"uncomfortable with the idea of being landmarked and having to answer to landmark guidelines\\", and was also uncomfortable with making part of the building into a \\"museum of past glory\\", as others nearby had done.

Also in the cast are Dabney Coleman, Fred Willard, Richard Benjamin, Eddie Albert, Scott Elliott, Cathryn Damon, and a cameo by Jane Curtin's fellow Saturday Night Live co-star Garrett Morris. The film was released in summer of 1980, grossing approximately US$7.5 million. This was the final American International Pictures production before its merger with Filmways and relaunch in October 2020 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Jane (Susan Saint James), Elaine (Jane Curtin), and Louise (Jessica Lange) are suburbanites in Eugene, Oregon. These three women, friends since high school, are currently all struggling with money. Jane is divorced, trying to cope with the man she is dating, Robert (Fred Willard), her newly single father (Eddie Albert), who moves in with Jane after his wife leaves him for another woman, and her young children, who need dental work. Jane learns she is pregnant, which makes Robert unhappy since both he and Jane are nearly broke. Elaine's husband, an architect, has left her for a younger woman. He has also left her with no money, no credit cards, and many overdue bills, leading to a scene with a man at the power company (Garrett Morris). Depressed, she gets drunk and her car is pulled over by police officer Jack (Dabney Coleman). Elaine makes a pass at him, trying to get out of the ticket. When he accepts, then reveals he is married, Elaine smacks him with her purse. She makes it clear that if she is arrested by Jack, her one phone call will be to his wife. Louise owns an antiques store. Unfortunately, it is not a very successful operation, so she is always accepting funds from her veterinarian husband (Richard Benjamin) to keep the store open. While they are in bed one evening, in the early process of making love, the doorbell rings. Louise is served a court order and learns her husband plans on suing her to force her into bankruptcy to wipe away the enormous debt she has incurred. The women become desperate. Elaine even tries a yard sale to raise money, selling her husband's possessions, including his deodorant. At the peak of their woes, Elaine visits the local mall, where an acquaintance (Cathryn Damon) has coaxed her into helping out with staging a community pageant. Elaine stares at a large, clear ball soon due to hold thousands of dollars in a giant cash \\"give away\\" and formulates the idea of stealing the money. She calls Jane and Louise to the mall, where they scheme to steal the money by drilling a hole beneath the ball and sucking out as much cash as possible with a high-powered vacuum, then escaping via the river behind the mall. Despite getting caught by officer Jack in the act of stealing items needed for the heist, Elaine again manages to sweet-talk her way out of being taken to jail. On the evening of the heist, each woman has an unexpected distraction, but finally find their way to the mall. Jane and Louise go to work beneath the cash ball while Elaine readies herself to throw the switch to the mall's lighting controls, aiding their escape. Unfortunately, a minor occurrence nearly causes mall security to notice the noise caused by Jane and Louise stealing the money. With no other way to distract the guards and shoppers, Elaine begins to rant about the high cost of living and how so many things cost \\"the shirt off your back -- and even THAT'S not enough!\\" She begins an impromptu striptease, exposing her bosom to the crowd. An indoor light pole falls directly into the ball, sending cash flowing out into the mall, driving people into a frenzy to collect it. During the uproar above, Jane and Louise make their escape to the river with two large trash bags filled with cash, only to have their canoe tip over when Louise stands up. They both fall in, and Louise can't swim, leaving Jane to decide to save the cash or her friend. She saves Louise and the two bags float away. Hours later, the sun is rising and both Jane and Louise are still on the bank of the river, crestfallen over the loss of the money, joined by Elaine, wrapped in a blanket. The three begin to argue, but Louise notices a bag floating by and all three of them dive in after it. At the film's end, Jane has married Robert and gotten her father a condo in a senior's complex; Louise reopens her store and takes back her husband, whom she had left; and Elaine begins dating the officer, with enough secret money to bring her back to the lifestyle she had been accustomed to. Cast Production Robert Kaufman had written the script for How to Beat the High Co$t of Living in 1971‚Äì1972, and Kaufman (and then later with Jere Henshaw) had 20th Century-Fox, Warner Bros., and Universal Pictures, all interested in the project if he could land major, bankable stars. Kaufman and Henshaw could not get the film made until Henshaw was hired by American International Pictures as executive senior vice president in charge of production. The pair first made the financially successful Love at First Bite, which gave them the green light to make How to Beat the High Co$t of Living with younger, lesser-known names. Most of the film was shot in and around Eugene, Oregon. Eugene was chosen because an indoor shopping mall was needed which was next to a river; the Valley River Center was situated next to the Willamette River. The production was budgeted at $4.75 million with a 42-day shooting schedule. Filming began on September 5, 1979 and wrapped in late October. While filming an outdoor scene in Eugene, a middle-aged man drove by in a car and yelled \\"Jane, you ignorant slut!,\\" referring to the Curtin and Dan Aykroyd Weekend Update Point/Counterpoint segment on Saturday Night Live. From 1984 to 1989, Curtin and Saint James would star in the popular CBS sitcom Kate & Allie.

Typically these tags begin with a phrase such as This tag may not be removed under penalty of law except by the consumer. Some states require tags on used bedding as well. The purpose of the law label is to inform the consumer of the hidden contents, or \\"filling materials\\" inside bedding and furniture products. The law label was born in the early 1900s to prevent these articles from being further manufactured with contents such as horse hair, corn husks and whatever else a manufacturer could find to use that the consumer would never see, similar to food labeling. Laws requiring these tags were passed in the United States to inform consumers as to whether the stuffed article they were buying contained new or recycled materials. Such stuffed article labelling laws exist in other jurisdictions, for example, the tag required on duvets sold in the United Kingdom, that describe the materials used and the tog insulation rating. Many mattress manufacturers such as Sealy, Simmons and Serta require these tags to be produced in the event of a warranty claim.  Popular culture  The wording of the warnings printed on some law labels has caused a common misconception in the USA that removing such a label under any circumstance is a crime, prohibiting consumers from removing labels from items they have purchased. Especially contributing to this confusion was that originally the wording on such labels did not contain the phrase \\"except by consumer\\".

He is the co-founder and keyboardist of Australian electro-rock group, the Rogue Traders, where he plays the keyboard and guitar. Ash was born in Windsor, Berkshire, England and his early schooling was at Wessex Gardens, Golders Green in North London and then Ashfold School in Buckinghamshire. He and his brother Gary then moved to Langwarrin, Victoria, Australia in 1982. The move only lasted 18 months, however, and the boys returned to the United Kingdom. Education continued at Paignton College, Devon ‚Äì then Cheam High, Surrey. Ash moved back to Australia in 1988 for one year and undertook Year 11 at Sandringham Secondary College in Melbourne. Ash began writing music in 1989 on a Commodore Amiga. Soon after returning to the United Kingdom in 1989, James met long-term collaborator Steve Davis who introduced him to Dance Music and DJing. Meanwhile, James completed his education at Carshalton College, Carshalton in 1992 and finally emigrated back once again to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Ash joined Melbourne community based radio station Hitz FM in 1993 as an on-air announcer. He began DJing in clubs in late 1993. Ash's first proper DJ gig was at Melbourne venue 'Lazar's' and was acquired after he lied about his skills as a nightclub DJ. He had actually never DJ'ed in a nightclub before. Ash got dragged off after just ten minutes by the manager who told him he was rubbish. He convinced the manager to give him another try next week and came into the venue during the daytimes to practise. Ash has been an active member of Australia's DJ fraternity since 1994, and has held residencies at most of Melbourne's leading clubs over the years. Ash's first record released was \\"Be With Me\\" under the name Faith in Technology through Colossal Records. He quickly followed this up with 'Thunderchild' under the moniker Thunderchild, released through leading Australian Dance label, Vicious Vinyl. Since 1994 Ash has released over forty remixes and original productions under names including: Faith In Technology, Thunderchild, Elan, Union State and Rogue Traders. In 1998 Ash turned 25 and moved to Melbourne dance radio station Kiss FM where he remained for the next few years. In 2000 Ash and long-term collaborator Steve Davis changed the name of their production partnership from Union State to Rogue Traders. In November 2008 after having enjoyed the success of two hit Rogue Traders albums and while working on the fourth Rogue Traders album, Ash released a dance song \\"Son of 91\\" on TV Rock's record label, making this track the first Ash had released under his own name. The track is a throwback to late eighties to early nineties dance music. Personal life James is married to singer Melinda Appleby (n√©e Richards) who appeared on the first Rogue Traders album We Know What You're Up To and continued to contribute to the writing of the following Rogue Traders albums. They are parents to twin boys Jack and Ben who were born in 2005.

He authored several works, including a collection of poems on the Flemish wars, (Cinque primi canti della guerra di Fiandra, 1551), one detailing military fortifications (Della fortificatione delle citt√†, by his friend Giacomo Fusto Castriotto, but edited, annotated, and published posthumously by Maggi in 1564), and several on the subject of philosophy. Early life and education Girolamo Maggi, De tintinnabulis liber postumus. Amsterdam: Henricus Wetstein, 1664. Maggi was born in Anghiari, Tuscany. Little is known about his youth. His year of birth is unknown; several authors have speculated, based on varying access to information. Maggi specifically mentioned how, in infancy, he was attacked by the same pestilence which, in 1563, he states was the most recent one to occur. This was most likely the black death of 1527 spread by Charles V's Protestant mercenaries (Landsknechts) when they defeated the French and pillaged the Vatican, but may have been one of the following year or of three years later. His parents were Paolo and Luisa, who quickly left him an orphan. As a young man, Maggi studied oratory with Pierantonio Ghezzi from Laterina, a master of Latin. Afterwards, to proceed with the then popular studies, he went at first to the nearby University of Perugia, then to that of Pisa, and finally to that of Bologna. In Pisa, he attended the lectures of the famous professor of Latin and Greek oratory, Francis Robortello, who was a faculty member from 1543 to 1549. Professional life Maggi, who beyond his native Tuscan, had mastered Latin and was erudite in Greek, Hebrew, and Spanish. Availing himself of such endowments, he went into jurisprudence, more to examine its spirit than its profession. Initially, he studied the method of Andrea Alciato, then that of Bartolo da Sassoferrato and the 14th and 15th century schools of thought. He became interested in ancient history, and quickly began studying epigraphy and architectonics. As part of this interest, Maggi accumulated a large collection of ancient tombstones, including ones from Como, Ravenna, Rieti, Foligno, Perugia and Rome. In Pisa, where he was still engaged in formal studies, and in other Italian cities, he visited and examined sepulchres and sarcophagi, and used his growing knowledge to dispute a universally accepted belief of the time: the idea of the existence of giants in ancient days. All of this work formed the bases for his tractatus on sepulchres. He worked diligently to provide correct interpretations of ancient works of Roman law and, for his successful explanation of a section of the Pandects of Justinian, as he himself tells the story, he was embraced and kissed by Robertello. In Pisa, he probably obtained his doctoral degree in 1546, and returned to his native land two years later. In 1548, he was requested by his fellow citizens to visit Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. He began this endeavor in Venice, the city where in those times, the greatest Italian minds lived quietly and profited greatly from their studies, due to the vast commerce of books fueled by the carefulness and tolerance of the government; there he again saw Robortello, and started a friendship with the famous writer Pietro Aretino. Maggi, who had nothing to offer, may have sought protection from Aretino, or hoped to avoid harsh criticism from him, when he sang the following hendecasyllabic verses, published in his 1551 Guerro di Fiandro (Canto II, verse 56): {  :L'uom tre volte chiarissimo e divino :Il famoso immortal Pietro Aretino.  :The man three times celebrated and divine :The famous immortal Pietro Aretino. } Pleased by the words, Aretino sent this poem on the Flemish wars to Chiapino Vitelli, the famous Spanish mercenary general, in February 1551, along with a letter praising Maggi's talents. Vitelli's family owned much land around Anghiari, in an area only a few miles from the Maggi estate. So, Maggi endeavored to please Vitelli, a soldier of Cosimo, to obtain good entrance at the royal court in Florence. He also praised Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, father of Cosimo I, whose daring son's rise to the throne of Florence well represented Maggi's goal. In five canti, Maggi often complained about his sad fate, showing himself unhappy with the legal profession exercised by him out of necessity. {  :Se il giovin quale Ulpian, Bartolo e Baldo :Disturban spesso e l'aspra inopia e dura :Non viene afforza al poetar men saldo, :E a l'avvocar rivolti ogni sua cura; :Io per certo infiammato esser e caldo :A fare il veggio un'immortal scrittura, :Gli dia la vita il Ciel, sostegno e 'l nido, :E 'l gran Cosmo udir√†, d'altr'opra il grido.  :Although this young man by Ulpian, Bartolo and Baldo :Is often distracted, and severe hardship :Does not assist him with writing verse, :And he turns his attention to legal practice; :Nonetheless I firmly believe that for his fiery temper :I will see him write immortal verse, :Aided by the might, support and protection of the Heavens :And the noble Cosimo will behold that great work. } Ottoman invasion He was a judge and military defense engineer in Famagusta on Cyprus when the island was invaded by Ottoman Turks in 1571. Besieged by the Turks, he invented machines to defend Famagusta against their attacks. When the island was conquered, Maggi was sent to the dungeons at Constantinople where, locked in chains, he wrote from memory two detailed treatises, De tintinnabulis, on bells and carillons, and the explicitly illustrated De equuleo, on torture devices. In attempts to be freed, he dedicated the first treatise to Carolus Rym (Charles Ramire), ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II, and the second treatise to Fran√ßois de Noailles, bishop of Aire and ambassador to the King of France. They were pleased with his works, and endeavoured to obtain his release. Their efforts, however, were brought to light as he was being released to the Italian ambassador. The prison captain ordered him to be detained and executed by strangulation. His two treatises were published posthumously in 1608 and 1609, respectively.

A sort of negative karma, it is generally seen as an evil effect on a person because of their wrongdoings or transgressions. The word has later been recycled for translating \\"divine retribution\\" or \\"divine fury\\" in the translations of the Bible to many local dialects in the Philippines. It is also translated as nemesis. The opposite of \\"Gaba\\" is Grasya, literally Grace in Spanish, which pertains to blessings from the Heavens.  Background  The gab√¢ can be characterized through various Cebuano proverbs: * It is not necessarily immediate in its effect. (Ang gab√¢ dili sama sa sili nga mohalang dayon.) * It may come unexpectedly. (Ang gab√¢ dili magsaba.) * It is not limited to transgressions against fellow human beings: objects considered holy can also cause gab√¢, such as dropping on the ground a sacred root crop of ubi. (The concept was later extended to religious icons such as bibles or rosaries). Even the least-valued object may cause it. (Bisan ang ube makagab√¢.) * It could happen to persons who are important to the transgressor. For example, people would say \\"gigab√¢an\\" of a womanizing father whose daughter has a child out of wedlock. = Sources = The source of gab√¢ is not a god or God or an absolute karmic principle, but in the spirits of nature. It must have arisen out of the animism of pre-Spanish Cebuanos. With the coming of Christianity into the Islands, gab√¢ became \\"absorbed\\" in the Roman Catholic Church. In-depth examination, however, would show that it is incompatible with Catholic dogma. = Applications =  Gab√¢ and panghimaraot  Gab√¢ is distinct from panghimaraot (curse) whereby a transgressed person pronounces a maldesyon against the transgressor. In panghimaraot, evil is asked to befall on the sinner; with gab√¢, evil is sure to befall on the sinner, even if it is not asked. Sometimes Cebuanos blurt out threats of gab√¢, \\"Gab√¢-an ka gyod!\\", but it is not taken to mean that gab√¢ is being asked; it is only a reminder to the transgressor that no one is excluded from it. Sometimes sinners also ask for exclusion in pidgin Spanish: Puyra gab√¢! (Fuera gab√¢)  Gab√¢ and karma  Gab√¢ is not synonymous with the Hindu-Buddhist law of karma: gab√¢ is only in the negative (a punishment), unlike karma which may be good or bad. Both concepts are known to the Visayan peoples, although gab√¢ is considered purely indigenous, while karma was historically imported. ; Gab√¢ and divine retribution Gab√¢ is not, strictly speaking, the same as punishment from a godhead, such as the monotheisms' God or the Greek goddess Nemesis: gab√¢ does not presuppose an Ultimate Being. Ill-doings to one's fellowmen does not alone cause Gaba but actions like wasting food, disrespecting elders, abusing animals, desacrating holy places or objects, cursing God, and destroying Nuno sa Punso cause Gaba as well. An expression is also common among the Bisaya and Hiligaynon, Purya Gaba which is said when one walks in an eerie place, this is believed to ward off evil. = Social effects = Some sociologists believe that Gab√¢ is one of the causes of the complacency of Cebuanos: because of their belief in it, they prefer to be silent on abuses. It gives hope to the oppressed that someday the abuses will be paid for.

Biography Born in Para√≠so, Tabasco, Palma starred in a dozen films before a dispute with Jorge Negrete, then-president of the National Association of Actors (ANDA), led to her being banned from the Mexican film industry. According to Palma, she and Negrete were nearly involved in a traffic accident on the Paseo de la Reforma in the summer of 1952. Negrete claimed that he was not involved, and that he just happened to be nearby at the time. When Palma talked to the press afterwards, not only did she comment on Negrete's driving, but she also took advantage of the opportunity to accuse Negrete of using his influence in the union to attempt to sabotage her career. Negrete argued that union sanctions were placed due to her stealing her own contract files from the offices of ANDA. Palma was married to a wealthy American and she became involved in the struggle between Mario Moreno \\"Cantinflas\\" and Negrete over leadership of the union, campaigning actively for Moreno. On January 10, 1953, ANDA held a special assembly to judge Palma. Moreno argued on her behalf, attempting to negotiate a settlement.

The 2016 American Community Survey estimates that 380,785 US residents report Nigerian ancestry, however it is believed to be higher than that as many fellow African-Americans are of Nigerian descent. The 2012-2016 ACS estimates that 277,027 American residents were born in Nigeria. Nigeria is both the most populous country in Africa‚Äî190.8 million as of 2018‚Äîand the African country of origin with the most migrants in the United States, as of 2013. History = Slavery (17th century ‚Äì 1865) = The first people of Nigerian ancestry in what is now the modern United States were brought to the Americas by force as slaves. Calabar and Badagry (Gberefu Island), Nigeria, became major points of export of enslaved people from Africa to the Americas during the 17th and 18th centuries. Most slave ships frequenting this port were English. Most of the slaves of Bight of Biafra ‚Äì many of whom hailed from the Igbo hinterland ‚Äì were trafficked to Virginia. After 400 years in the United States and the lack of documentation because of enslavement, African Americans have often been unable to track their ancestors to specific ethnic groups or regions of Africa. Like Americans of other origins, at this point most African Americans have ancestors of a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Most of the people who were kidnapped from Nigeria were likely to have been Igbo, and Yoruba. Other ethnic groups, such as the Fulani and Edo people were also captured and transported to the colonies in the New World. The Igbo were exported mainly to Maryland and Virginia. They comprised the majority of all enslaved Africans in Virginia during the 18th century: of the 37,000 Africans trafficked to Virginia from Calabar during the eighteenth century, 30,000 were Igbo. In the next century, people of Igbo descent were taken with settlers who moved to Kentucky. According to some historians, the Igbo also comprised most of the slaves in Maryland. This group was characterized by high rates of rebellion and suicide, as the people resisted and fought back against enslavement. Some Nigerian ethnic groups, such as the Yoruba, and some northern Nigerian ethnic groups, had traditional, cultural identification marks, such as tattoo and scarification designs. These could have assisted a kidnapped and enslaved person who escaped in locating other members of their ethnic group, but few enslaved people managed to escape the colonies. In the colonies, slavers tried to dissuade the practice of traditional tribal customs. They also mixed people of different ethnic groups together to make it more difficult for them to communicate and band together in rebellion.\\"Ethnicity and the Slave Trade: 'Lucumi' and 'Nago' as Ethnonyms in West Africa\\", =Modern immigration= According to the United Census Bureau, 4 percent of Nigerians hold the Ph.D. degree compared to 1% of the general US population. 17% of Nigerians hold a master's degree and 37% have a bachelor's degree. Since the mid-20th century particularly, after Nigeria gained independence, many modern Nigerian immigrants have come to the United States to pursue educational opportunities in undergraduate and post-graduate institutions. In the 1960s and 1970s after the Biafra War, Nigeria's government funded scholarships for Nigerian students, and many of them were admitted to American universities. While this was happening, there were several military coups, interspersed with brief periods of civilian rule. The instability resulted in many Nigerian professionals emigrating, especially doctors, lawyers and academics, who found it difficult to return to Nigeria.\\"Nigerians in Chicago\\". Posted by Charles Adams Cogan and Cyril Ibe, Encyclopedia of Chicago; Retrieved May 2, 2013 During the mid- to late-1980s, a larger wave of Nigerians immigrated to the United States. This migration was driven by political and economic problems exacerbated by the military regimes of self-styled generals Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha. Other √©migr√©s comprised a large number of refugees, fleeing on account of religious persecutions, endless political unrests and ethnic/tribal conflicts, the presumption of Nigeria as a failing state, or just to enhance the quality of lives for themselves and their families (Ogbuagu, 2013). The most noticeable exodus occurred among professional and middle-class Nigerians who, along with their children, took advantage of education and employment opportunities in the United States. This exodus contributed to a \\"brain-drain\\" of Nigeria's intellectual resources to the detriment of its future. Since the advent of multi-party democracy in March 1999, the former Nigerian head-of-state Olusegun Obasanjo has made numerous appeals, especially to young Nigerian professionals in the United States, to return to Nigeria to help in its rebuilding effort. Obasanjo's efforts have met with mixed results, as some potential migrants consider Nigeria's socio-economic situation still unstable (Ogbuagu, 2013b). Education According to data provided by Rice University in Texas, the people who make up the Nigerian-American group are among the most educated ethnic individuals in the United States.https://www.chron.com/news/article/Data-show-Nigerians-the-most- educated-in-the-U-S-1600808.php According to the Migrations Policy Institute, 29% of Nigerian-Americans have a master's degree, PhD, or an advanced professional degree (compared to 11% of the U.S population overall). Nigerian- Americans are also known for their contributions to medicine, science, technology, arts and literature.https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/the-most- successful-ethnic-group-in-the-u-s-may-surprise-you/86885/ Nigerian culture has long emphasized education, placing value on pursuing education as a means to financial success and personal fulfillment. Examples of Nigerian-Americans in education include Akintunde Akinwande, Kunle Olukotun and Jacob Olupona, professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and Harvard University respectively. Other popular examples include Dr. Bennet Omalu and ImeIme Umana, the first Black woman to be elected president of the Harvard Law Review. A large percentage of black students at highly selective top universities are immigrants or children of immigrants. Harvard University, for example, has estimated that more than one-third of its black student body consists of recent immigrants or their children, or were of mixed-race parentage. Other top universities, including Yale, Princeton, Penn, Columbia, Rice, Duke and Berkeley, report a similar pattern. As a result, there is a question as to whether affirmative action programs adequately reach their original targets: African Americans who are descendants of American slaves and their discriminatory history in the US. According to the 2016 Open Doors report, the top five U.S. institutions with the largest student population of Nigerian descent (in no particular order) are Texas Southern University, University of Houston, University of Texas at Arlington, University of North Texas, and Houston Community College. According to the 2017 report, 11,710 Nigerian immigrants studied in the U.S. in the 2016-17 academic year, the 12th highest country of origin and highest of any African country. Demography and areas of concentrated residence As of 2013, the World Bank estimated that 252,172 Nigerian migrants live in the US. This is 23% of all Nigerian migrants, the most of any destination country. Nigerian migrants represent 0.5% of all migrants in the US, the 32nd highest of all US source countries. Based on DNA studies, an estimated 80 percent of African Americans (about 35 million) could have some Igbo or Hausa ancestry. Therefore, 60 percent of them, according to historian Douglas B. Chambers, could have at least one Igbo ancestor. =US states with the largest Nigerian populations= The 2016 American Community Survey estimates that 380,785 US residents report Nigerian ancestry. The 2012-2016 ACS estimates that 277,027 American residents were born in Nigeria. It also estimates that these states have the highest Nigerian-born population: # Texas 60,173 # Maryland 31,263 # New York 29,619 # California 23,302 # Georgia 19,182 # Illinois 15,389 # New Jersey 14,780 # Florida 8,274 # Massachusetts 6,661 # Pennsylvania 6,371 Religious demographics Nigerian Muslim association in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York Igbo Roman Catholics in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Los Angeles, California In terms of religion the Nigerian community is split, Christianity (41%) and many others following Islam (47%) and other religions (2%) . Traditional attire Among Nigerian Americans, traditional Nigerian attire remains very popular. However, because the fabric is often hard to acquire outside of Nigeria, traditional attire is not worn on an everyday basis but rather, reserved for special occasions such as weddings, Independence Day celebrations and birthday ceremonies. For weddings, the fabric used to sew the outfit of the bride and groom is usually directly imported from Nigeria or bought from local Nigerian traders and then taken to a local tailor who then sews it into the preferred style. Due to the large number of Nigerians living in America and the cultural enrichment that these communities provide to non- Nigerians, the traditional attire has been adopted in many parts of the country as a symbol of African ethnicity, for example, clothes worn during Kwanzaa celebrations are known to be very influenced by Nigerian traditional attire. In recent years, the traditional fabric has attracted many admirers especially among celebrities such as Solange Knowles and most notably Erykah Badu. On the fashion runway, Nigerian American designers like Boston-born Kiki Kimanu are able to combine the rich distinct colours of traditional attire with Western styles to make clothes that are highly sought after by young Nigerian professionals and Americans alike. Nigerian American ethnic groups =Igbo American= Igbo Americans are people in the United States that maintain an identity of a varying level of Igbo ethnic group that now call the United States their chief place of residence (and may also have US citizenship). Many moved to the US following the effects of the Biafran War (1967‚Äì1970). The Igbos lived in small clans during the pre-colonial era. =Yoruba American= Yoruba Americans are Americans of Yoruba descent. The Yoruba people (') are an ethnic group originating in southwestern Nigeria and southern Benin in West Africa.The first Yoruba people who arrived to the United States were imported as slaves from Nigeria and Benin during the Atlantic slave trade. This ethnicity of the slaves was one of the main origins of present-day Nigerians who arrived to the United States, along with the Igbos. In addition, native slaves of current Benin hailed from peoples such as Nago (Yoruba subgroup, although exported mainly by Spanish, when Louisiana was Spanish), Ewe, Fon and Gen. Many slaves imported to the modern United States from Benin were sold by the King of Dahomey, in Whydah. The native tongue of the Yoruba people is spoken principally in Nigeria and Benin, with communities in other parts of Africa, Europe and the Americas.

History The school was founded in 1888 and was known as Independence High School. The first building was located at the intersection of Pleasant and Truman Road, the current location of the Palmer/Central Office Building. It is from this location that President Harry S. Truman, First Lady Bess Truman, and Truman White House Press Secretary and Pulitzer Prize winner Charles Griffith Ross graduated from in 1901. In 1917 the Independence School District passed a levy and bond to build a new high school building. Margaret Chrisman Swope offered to sell the district land for the new school at the southeast corner of Union and Maple for $1 in exchange for naming the school after her father, William Chrisman. Chrisman had served as a member of the first school board in 1866 and was also a prominent lawyer and banker in the community. The new building opened in 1918 as William Chrisman High School. The high school moved to its current site in 1956, at the northeast corner of Noland Road and U.S. Route 24 (Independence Avenue), when a major addition was added to Ott Elementary School and the building was converted into the high school. Since that time the building has undergone numerous additions. Demographics William Chrisman is home to 1491 students from Independence, Missouri and part of Sugar Creek, Missouri (as of the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year).

This was the second time that \\"The Peach\\" has aired at 96.5. With the simulcast, WZCH at 102.5 covered Warner-Robins clearly, while WPCH covered Macon and surrounding areas clearly.

The school colors of gray and red were chosen by the first student council and the name \\"falcons\\" was selected because it was the mascot of the newly established U.S. Air Force Academy. The school was dubbed \\"The Factory\\" because of its new age metallic look that covered the exterior of the building. Patrons suggested that until the renovations of 2011, many people struggled to identify it as a school when they drove by as it looked much like a factory that one would see in an industrial area. Van Horn was named the first \\"A+ designated school\\" of the Kansas City, Missouri School District.Van Horn High School website During the 1960s, continued to grow as many professionals and blue collar workers flocked to the area. The school ballooned to over 2000 students in the late 1960s and it became apparent that another high school was needed to ease overcrowding. A measure was put on the ballot for a new high school to be built at Cassell Park which was located in southwest Independence. The measure passed but the Kansas City School District decided to reallocate funds towards building a new middle school in another part of the city. Patrons suggested that this caused a great deal of frustration and planted the seeds for animosity between the community and the Kansas City School District. At an attempt to compete with urban sprawl, the KCSD began busing students to Van Horn from all parts of Kansas City. This program led to students attending Van Horn who were not from the community. As the building and school spirit deteriorated, the school began to drop off academically during the 1980s. Time magazine conducted a story in which they called it one of America's \\"Dropout Factories.\\" This was an instance in which the school's nickname was no longer flattering. The school continued to see a steady decline in attendance and academic progress throughout the 1990s.  2008 change of district  Van Horn prior to the renovation In November 2007, the voters of Independence, the city in which Van Horn and its feeder schools are located, and Kansas City, the district that housed the school, voted for Van Horn, its feeder middle school, and three elementary schools to be taken over by the Independence School District.

In addition to locker rooms and a new concession stand, this structure also provided a mezzanine suitable for the school's wrestling program. Van Horn also added a culinary kitchen and a metal shop which allowed the school to become the hub for these programs for the district's academy program. A new practice athletics field was also created just to the north of the Truman Road bridge. On the north side of Van Horn, the old \\"E\\" Building was destroyed and additional parking was added.

He was the chief legal counsel for President Richard Nixon during the Watergate Scandal. Early life James St. Clair was born on April 14, 1920, in Akron, Ohio. He was raised in a number of Midwest cities, including Erie, Pennsylvania, Buffalo, New York, and Albany, New York. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1941. From 1942 to 1945 was an officer in the United States Navy. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1947 and joined the firm of Hale & Dorr two years later. He became a senior partner in 1954. Legal career =Army‚ÄìMcCarthy hearings= St. Clair first gained notice while assisting Joseph Welch in the Army‚ÄìMcCarthy hearings of 1954. St. Clair selected Fred Fisher to assist with the case. Fisher was sent home before the hearings began after Welch confirmed his prior membership in the National Lawyers Guild, an organization accused of Communist sympathies. Joseph McCarthy attacked Fisher's membership in the group, which led to Welch's famous line \\"Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\\" In 1955, St. Clair assisted with the defense of Wendell H. Furry, a Harvard physics professor who was charged with Contempt of Congress for refusing to testify before McCarthy and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. =1960s and 70s= In 1961, he was hired by Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe to prepare removal proceedings against Boston police commissioner Leo J. Sullivan. The following year he handled the removal proceedings against state waterways director Rodolphe G. Bessette following Bessette's indictment for perjury and conspiracy. In 1967 he defended Frederick Wiseman when the Massachusetts government attempted to censor Titicut Follies, Wiseman's documentary about the conditions of Bridgewater State Hospital. In 1968 he defended William Sloane Coffin, a Yale chaplain who was found guilty of treason for advising students to avoid the draft (Coffin's counsel during the appeals process, Arthur Goldberg, got the conviction overturned). In 1972, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court appointed St. Clair and Raymond Young to investigate the complaints against Judge Jerome P. Troy. During the early 1970s, St. Clair served as the chief counsel for the Boston School Committee in a lawsuit that led to court ordered bussing. He left the case to become counsel for President Nixon and Hale & Dorr resigned from the case that following year when the school committee refused to approve a citywide busing plan. =Counsel for Richard Nixon= In December 1973, St. Clair was appointed as a special counsel to Richard Nixon. He had previously been offered the position of chief litigator for special prosecutor Archibald Cox, however he chose to work for Nixon instead, as he wanted to be in charge rather than report to another attorney. He assisted Republican counsel to the House Judiciary Committee Albert E. Jenner Jr. and defended Nixon before the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon. The court ruled unanimously against Nixon. Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 and St. Clair's assignment as his legal counsel ended on August 14 after completing Judge John Sirica's request to make a final search for a missing White House tape. =Later career= In 1976, St. Clair was assigned by the Roxbury District Court to defend Randolph Lewis, an African-American charged with severely beating a white man, who later died. During the trial, St. Clair was assigned bodyguards due to threats made against him. Lewis was found guilty, but St. Clair was able to get the conviction overturned on appeal. The indictments against Lewis were dropped in 1983. St. Clair served as legal counsel for the states of Maine, South Carolina, and the town of Mashpee, Massachusetts, who were being sued by Native Americans claiming lands once occupied by their tribes. In 1983, St. Clair led Buddy LeRoux's legal battle to take over ownership of the Boston Red Sox. In 1987 he defended Westfield State College president Francis J. Pilecki, who was accused of sexually molesting two students. Pilecki was found not guilty in one of the cases and the charges were dropped in the other after a civil settlement was reached. In 1992, Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn appointed St. Clair to lead a commission investigating the Police Department. The commission made 36 recommendations, including that Flynn not reappoint his lifelong friend, Francis Roache, as police commissioner. The police department elected to adopt 31 of the 36 recommendations, however the mayor elected to retain Roache. Personal life and death St. Clair resided in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He died on March 10, 2001 at a nursing home in Westwood, Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife of 56 years and three children, one of whom Margaret, served as Secretary of Energy under Governor Edward J. King.

The school was established in 1914. The enrollment of Raytown High School currently stands at 1503 students. The school, located in downtown Raytown, underwent two years of renovations from 1992‚Äì1994. The most recent renovations were completed just before the 2008‚Äì2009 term, and included the addition of 2 science classrooms. The school currently has Missouri A+ designation, and is MSIP Accredited. History \\"In 1903, Raytown's first high school, located on the corner of 63rd street and Raytown Road, was housed in a wood frame store, where parents paid four dollars a month for 25 children to attend the one- teacher school. In 1907 the first school graduated 12 students. In 1906 Consolidated District #2 (first created in 1903) was reorganized under the Buford Act, consolidating 8 independent rural schools districts: Bennington, Central, Chapel, Lane, Parkview, Raytown, Spring Valley, and Stormy Point. By 1948 these 8 schools were consolidated into 3: Blue Ridge, Chapel, and Raytown. In 1914 a combination high school and grade school was built at 63rd and Raytown Road, and in 1927 the construction of the original section of the present Raytown High School was completed. In 1939 the W.P.A. helped add the south wing, which was followed by the north wing addition in 1950. In November 1944 floodlights were added to the athletic field, and it was then dedicated as a Memorial field to honor the 21 graduated who died in World War II. Construction on the north wing and the band room followed in 1967. The last renovation took place in 1992‚Äì1994. In the fall of 2004 the Physical Education locker room renovations were completed. Raytown High School's outstanding reputation for excellence in academics and extra-curricular activities earned it admission to the North Central Association of Secondary Schools and colleges in 1946, and in 1951 the state awarded Raytown High School its AAA classification.\\" This is taken from the Raytown High School Handbook located at the Raytown Quality Schools Online Site. http://www.raytown.k12.mo.us/ Notable alumni *Bobbi Johnson Kauffman, 1963 graduate; Miss USA 1964. *Jason Belser, 1988 graduate; Selected by the Indianapolis Colts as the 197th overall pick of the 1992 NFL draft (first pick, 8th round).

Biography Swami Kalyandev was born as Kaluram on the claimed date of 26 June 1876, in the village of Kotana, Bagpat district, Uttar Pradesh and grew up in Mundbhar, Muzaffarnagar. In his youth, he traveled to Ayodhya and Haridwar. While in Haridwar he heard of Swami Vivekananda's visit to Khetri, and traveled there to meet him. On his return from Khetri, Kalyandev became the disciple of Swami Purnananda of Muni Ki Reti, Rishikesh. Purananda named him Swami Kalyandev. Kalyandev did tapasya in the Himalayas for a few years but then decided to help the poor people of his region. Kalyandev established almost three hundred schools and medical facilities for the people of western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and elsewhere. He was also noted for his advocacy against untouchability and the caste system. Kalyandev also supported rebuilding of neglected religious and historical sites. He renovated a monument in Shuktal, Muzaffarnagar associated with Shuka. There, he also established the Shukadeva Ashrama and Seva Samiti. He also renovated parts of Hastinapur, and several pilgrimage sites in Haryana. =Later life= In 1982 he received the Padma Sri award, and in 2000 he received the Padma Bhushan. He was also awarded an honorary D.Litt. by Meerut University. In the late 1980s future Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh came to Shukatal to pray along with his wife and Kalyandev told him to do his first rally near Bhayla. His advice has been credited with repopularizing Singh as a politician. During an interview, Kalyandev said his inspiration came in 1893, when he met Vivekananda in Khetri, who said to him, \\"If you want to see God, go to the huts of the poor. And if you want to attain God, then serve the poor, the helpless, the downtrodden and the miserable.\\" Kalyandev stated that to attain God through service of the poor is the mantra he received from Swamiji.

Several publishers rejected the manuscript before it was finally accepted by Random House and published in 1954. The popularity of the book resulted in a Broadway show and a film, which launched the career of Andy Griffith.  After No Time for Sergeants  Hyman, who was living in Cordele with his wife and three children, had published just three short stories and was struggling with his second novel when he died of a heart attack in 1963, just one month before his fortieth birthday.

He is a co-founder of the National Association of Science, Technology, and Society Studies, and has served as a national program consultant for the National Endowment for the Humanities. Goldman is the author/editor of eight books. Long Biography Steven Goldman has degrees in physics (B.Sc., Polytechnic University of New York) and philosophy (M.A., Ph.D., Boston University) and, since 1977, has been the Andrew W. Mellon Distinguished Professor in the Humanities at Lehigh University. He has a joint appointment in the departments of philosophy and history because his teaching and research focus on the history, philosophy, and social relations of modern science and technology. Professor Goldman came to Lehigh from the philosophy department at the State College campus of Pennsylvania State University, where he was a co-founder of one of the first U.S. academic programs in science, technology, and society (STS) studies. For 11 years (1977‚Äì1988), he served as director of Lehigh‚Äôs STS program and was a co-founder of the National Association of Science, Technology and Society Studies. Professor Goldman has received the Lindback Distinguished Teaching Award from Lehigh University and a Book-of-the-Year Award for a book he coauthored (another book was a finalist and translated into 10 languages). He has been a national lecturer for Sigma Xi‚Äîthe scientific research society‚Äîand a national program consultant for the National Endowment for the Humanities. He has served as a board member or as editor/advisory editor for a number of professional organizations and journals and was a co-founder of Lehigh University Press and, for many years, co-editor of its Research in Technology Studies series. Since the early 1960s, Professor Goldman has studied the historical development of the conceptual framework of modern science in relation to its Western cultural context, tracing its emergence from medieval and Renaissance approaches to the study of nature through its transformation in the 20th century. He has published numerous scholarly articles on his social-historical approach to medieval and Renaissance nature philosophy and to modern science from the 17th to the 20th centuries and has lectured on these subjects at conferences and universities across the United States, in Europe, and in Asia. In the late 1970s, the professor began a similar social- historical study of technology and technological innovation since the Industrial Revolution. In the 1980s, he published a series of articles on innovation as a socially driven process and on the role played in that process by the knowledge created by scientists and engineers. These articles led to participation in science and technology policy initiatives of the federal government, which in turn led to extensive research and numerous article and book publications through the 1990s on emerging synergies that were transforming relationships among knowledge, innovation, and global commerce.

Background The demographics of Burundi through the 1960s and 1970s were roughly 86 percent Hutu, 13 percent Tutsi, and 1 percent Twa. For most of this period, the Tutsi maintained a near monopoly on senior government and military positions. Burundi gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, and in May 1965 the first post-independence elections were held. The Hutu candidates scored a landslide victory, capturing 23 seats out of a total 33. But, instead of appointing a Hutu prime minister, the king Mwambutsa IV appointed a Tutsi prince, L√©opold Biha, as Prime Minister. On October 18, 1965, Hutus, angry with the king's decision, attempted a coup. The king fled the country, but the coup ultimately failed. In 1972 another Hutu coup attempt was crushed by the Tutsi-dominated government and armed forces, resulting in a genocide in which between 100,000 and 150,000, mostly Hutus, were killed.Israel Charny (2000) Encyclopedia of Genocide ABC-CLIO p.510 Prelude =Tensions between Burundi and Rwanda rise in the 1990s= In October 1990, Rwandan exiles, mostly Tutsi, who had served for years in the Ugandan Armed Forces, invaded Rwanda. The next three years consisted of war between the Hutu government and the invading forces known as the Rwanda Patriotic Front. In 1993 emissaries from the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) made a peace agreement. A ceasefire was in effect from then on until April 6. On April 6, 1994, the presidents of both Burundi and Rwanda were returning to the Rwandan capital of Kigali with other regional leaders from peace talks in Tanzania. The Rwandan president was under strong international pressure to implement the 1993 peace agreement. =Ethnic polarization escalates in Burundi during the 1990s= In June 1993 in Burundi, the Hutu Party, , FRODEBU, and its presidential candidate, Melchior Ndadaye, won the election and formed the first Hutu government in the country. Tensions began to escalate almost immediately. Small bands of Hutu and Tutsi 'gangs' consistently fought both in and around the then-capital, Bujumbura, often growing into larger groups armed with machetes and attacking each other.

The advantage of this technique is that it can theoretically produce images with the angular resolution of a huge telescope with an aperture equal to the separation between the component telescopes. The main drawback is that it does not collect as much light as the complete instrument's mirror. Thus it is mainly useful for fine resolution of more luminous astronomical objects, such as close binary stars. Another drawback is that the maximum angular size of a detectable emission source is limited by the minimum gap between detectors in the collector array. Interferometry is most widely used in radio astronomy, in which signals from separate radio telescopes are combined. A mathematical signal processing technique called aperture synthesis is used to combine the separate signals to create high-resolution images. In Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio telescopes separated by thousands of kilometers are combined to form a radio interferometer with a resolution which would be given by a hypothetical single dish with an aperture thousands of kilometers in diameter. At the shorter wavelengths used in infrared astronomy and optical astronomy it is more difficult to combine the light from separate telescopes, because the light must be kept coherent within a fraction of a wavelength over long optical paths, requiring very precise optics. Practical infrared and optical astronomical interferometers have only recently been developed, and are at the cutting edge of astronomical research. At optical wavelengths, aperture synthesis allows the atmospheric seeing resolution limit to be overcome, allowing the angular resolution to reach the diffraction limit of the optics. ESO‚Äôs VLT interferometer took the first detailed image of a disc around a young star. Astronomical interferometers can produce higher resolution astronomical images than any other type of telescope. At radio wavelengths, image resolutions of a few micro-arcseconds have been obtained, and image resolutions of a fractional milliarcsecond have been achieved at visible and infrared wavelengths. One simple layout of an astronomical interferometer is a parabolic arrangement of mirror pieces, giving a partially complete reflecting telescope but with a \\"sparse\\" or \\"dilute\\" aperture. In fact the parabolic arrangement of the mirrors is not important, as long as the optical path lengths from the astronomical object to the beam combiner (focus) are the same as would be given by the complete mirror case. Instead, most existing arrays use a planar geometry, and Labeyrie's hypertelescope will use a spherical geometry. History A 20-foot Michelson interferometer mounted on the frame of the 100-inch Hooker Telescope, 1920. One of the first uses of optical interferometry was applied by the Michelson stellar interferometer on the Mount Wilson Observatory's reflector telescope to measure the diameters of stars. The red giant star Betelgeuse was the first to have its diameter determined in this way on December 13, 1920. In the 1940s radio interferometry was used to perform the first high resolution radio astronomy observations. For the next three decades astronomical interferometry research was dominated by research at radio wavelengths, leading to the development of large instruments such as the Very Large Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Optical/infrared interferometry was extended to measurements using separated telescopes by Johnson, Betz and Townes (1974) in the infrared and by Labeyrie (1975) in the visible. In the late 1970s improvements in computer processing allowed for the first \\"fringe-tracking\\" interferometer, which operates fast enough to follow the blurring effects of astronomical seeing, leading to the Mk I, II and III series of interferometers. Similar techniques have now been applied at other astronomical telescope arrays, including the Keck Interferometer and the Palomar Testbed Interferometer. Aerial view of the ESO/NAOJ/NRAO ALMA construction site. In the 1980s the aperture synthesis interferometric imaging technique was extended to visible light and infrared astronomy by the Cavendish Astrophysics Group, providing the first very high resolution images of nearby stars. In 1995 this technique was demonstrated on an array of separate optical telescopes for the first time, allowing a further improvement in resolution, and allowing even higher resolution imaging of stellar surfaces. Software packages such as BSMEM or MIRA are used to convert the measured visibility amplitudes and closure phases into astronomical images. The same techniques have now been applied at a number of other astronomical telescope arrays, including the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer, the Infrared Spatial Interferometer and the IOTA array. A number of other interferometers have made closure phase measurements and are expected to produce their first images soon, including the VLTI, the CHARA array and Le Coroller and Dejonghe's Hypertelescope prototype. If completed, the MRO Interferometer with up to ten movable telescopes will produce among the first higher fidelity images from a long baseline interferometer. The Navy Optical Interferometer took the first step in this direction in 1996, achieving 3-way synthesis of an image of Mizar; then a first-ever six-way synthesis of Eta Virginis in 2002; and most recently \\"closure phase\\" as a step to the first synthesized images produced by geostationary satellites. Modern astronomical interferometry Astronomical interferometry is principally conducted using Michelson (and sometimes other type) interferometers. The principal operational interferometric observatories which use this type of instrumentation include VLTI, NPOI, and CHARA. Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI), a 437 ma baselined optical/near-infrared, 6-beam Michelson Interferometer at 2163 m elevation on Anderson Mesa in Northern Arizona, USA. Four additional 1.8-meter telescopes are being installed starting from 2013. Light collected by three ESO VLT auxiliary telescopes, and combined using the technique of interferometry. This image shows one of a series of sophisticated optical and mechanical systems called star separators for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). Current projects will use interferometers to search for extrasolar planets, either by astrometric measurements of the reciprocal motion of the star (as used by the Palomar Testbed Interferometer and the VLTI), through the use of nulling (as will be used by the Keck Interferometer and Darwin) or through direct imaging (as proposed for Labeyrie's Hypertelescope). Engineers at the European Southern Observatory ESO designed the Very Large Telescope VLT so that it can also be used as an interferometer. Along with the four unit telescopes, four mobile 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes (ATs) were included in the overall VLT concept to form the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The ATs can move between 30 different stations, and at present, the telescopes can form groups of two or three for interferometry. When using interferometry, a complex system of mirrors brings the light from the different telescopes to the astronomical instruments where it is combined and processed. This is technically demanding as the light paths must be kept equal to within 1/1000 mm over distances of a few hundred metres. For the Unit Telescopes, this gives an equivalent mirror diameter of up to , and when combining the auxiliary telescopes, equivalent mirror diameters of up to can be achieved. This is up to 25 times better than the resolution of a single VLT unit telescope. The VLTI gives astronomers the ability to study celestial objects in unprecedented detail. It is possible to see details on the surfaces of stars and even to study the environment close to a black hole. With a spatial resolution of 4 milliarcseconds, the VLTI has allowed astronomers to obtain one of the sharpest images ever of a star. This is equivalent to resolving the head of a screw at a distance of . Notable 1990s results included the Mark III measurement of diameters of 100 stars and many accurate stellar positions, COAST and NPOI producing many very high resolution images, and Infrared Stellar Interferometer measurements of stars in the mid-infrared for the first time. Additional results include direct measurements of the sizes of and distances to Cepheid variable stars, and young stellar objects. Two of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter array (ALMA) 12-metre antennas gaze at the sky at the observatory's Array Operations Site (AOS), high on the Chajnantor plateau at an altitude of 5000 metres in the Chilean Andes. High on the Chajnantor plateau in the Chilean Andes, the European Southern Observatory (ESO), together with its international partners, is building ALMA, which will gather radiation from some of the coldest objects in the Universe. ALMA will be a single telescope of a new design, composed initially of 66 high-precision antennas and operating at wavelengths of 0.3 to 9.6 mm. Its main 12-meter array will have fifty antennas, 12 metres in diameter, acting together as a single telescope ‚Äì an interferometer. An additional compact array of four 12-metre and twelve 7-meter antennas will complement this. The antennas can be spread across the desert plateau over distances from 150 metres to 16 kilometres, which will give ALMA a powerful variable \\"zoom\\". It will be able to probe the Universe at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, with a resolution up to ten times greater than the Hubble Space Telescope, and complementing images made with the VLT interferometer. Optical interferometers are mostly seen by astronomers as very specialized instruments, capable of a very limited range of observations. It is often said that an interferometer achieves the effect of a telescope the size of the distance between the apertures; this is only true in the limited sense of angular resolution. The amount of light gathered‚Äîand hence the dimmest object that can be seen‚Äîdepends on the real aperture size, so an interferometer would offer little improvement as the image is dim (the thinned-array curse). The combined effects of limited aperture area and atmospheric turbulence generally limits interferometers to observations of comparatively bright stars and active galactic nuclei. However, they have proven useful for making very high precision measurements of simple stellar parameters such as size and position (astrometry), for imaging the nearest giant stars and probing the cores of nearby active galaxies. For details of individual instruments, see the list of astronomical interferometers at visible and infrared wavelengths. { -----  align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\"  250px  align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\"  250px -----  valign=\\"top\\"  A simple two-element optical interferometer. Light from two small telescopes (shown as lenses) is combined using beam splitters at detectors 1, 2, 3 and 4. The elements creating a 1/4-wave delay in the light allow the phase and amplitude of the interference visibility to be measured, which give information about the shape of the light source.  valign=\\"top\\"  A single large telescope with an aperture mask over it (labelled Mask), only allowing light through two small holes. The optical paths to detectors 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the same as in the left-hand figure, so this setup will give identical results. By moving the holes in the aperture mask and taking repeated measurements, images can be created using aperture synthesis which would have the same quality as would have been given by the right-hand telescope without the aperture mask. In an analogous way, the same image quality can be achieved by moving the small telescopes around in the left-hand figure ‚Äî this is the basis of aperture synthesis, using widely separated small telescopes to simulate a giant telescope. } At radio wavelengths, interferometers such as the Very Large Array and MERLIN have been in operation for many years. The distances between telescopes are typically , although arrays with much longer baselines utilize the techniques of Very Long Baseline Interferometry. In the (sub)-millimetre, existing arrays include the Submillimeter Array and the IRAM Plateau de Bure facility. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array has been fully operational since March 2013. Max Tegmark and Matias Zaldarriaga have proposed the Fast Fourier Transform Telescope which would rely on extensive computer power rather than standard lenses and mirrors. If Moore's law continues, such designs may become practical and cheap in a few years.

Helen made her debut in the third- season episode \\"Andy Discovers America\\" (1963). Helen was a schoolteacher and became main character Sheriff Andy Taylor's girlfriend. Helen also appeared in TAGS spinoff, Mayberry R.F.D. (1968‚Äì1971), and in the TAGS reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry (1986). Helen was portrayed by Aneta Corsaut.  Character biography  Helen Crump hails from Kansas and attended college in Kansas City. She majored in journalism. Helen takes up residence in Mayberry and is employed as an elementary schoolteacher. Her uncle, Edward, and her young niece, Cynthia, visit her in Mayberry. Unlike other Mayberry women, Helen has no special skills in the kitchen. She enjoys picnicking, and, in one episode, directs the high school's senior play. An independent, self-sufficient, professional single woman, Helen is a wise and thoughtful character, but at times can be abrupt, displaying a quick temper and showing flashes of temperamentality as well as jumping to conclusions about issues involving her without thinking things through (see examples below), who serves on most occasions as the voice of reason on the show. In the third-season episode, \\"Andy Discovers America\\" (1963), Opie and his classmates take a dislike to their new teacher Helen Crump (whom they call \\"old lady Crump\\"). The boys complain about her history assignments. After Andy gives Opie some advice about his own experience with school (which Opie misconstrues into thinking he doesn't have to do his history schoolwork), Helen appears at the courthouse and, acting on her assumptions based on Opie's misinterpretation of his father's advice, proceeds to give Andy a piece of her mind on his interference in her domain. Andy is dumbfounded but finds a way to get the boys excited about their history assignments. Helen is astonished but pleased with the change in Opie and his pals. When she learns Andy played a part in the turnabout, she thanks him and the two become friends. At the end of the episode, Andy shows his attraction to Helen by offering to walk her home and attempting to rid himself of Barney Fife who wants to discuss history with Helen. = Relationship with Andy Taylor = Helen in \\"Helen, the Authoress\\". Andy and Helen have many pleasant social outings: they attend dances, picnic at Myers Lake, and double date with others (usually Barney Fife and Thelma Lou). Their relationship however, is not one of complete sweetness and light. The two have frequent disagreements, sudden jealousies (particularly on Helen's part, most often needlessly so), misunderstandings (also mainly on Helen's part) and lover's quarrels. For example, in \\"Guest in the House\\", Helen becomes needlessly jealous and starts an argument with Andy when a female friend of the Taylor family comes to stay at Andy's house after an argument with her fianc√©. In \\"Helen, the Authoress\\", Helen has written a book and uses her evenings to rewrite the manuscript before its publication by a Richmond firm. When she cancels a dinner date with Andy to work on her book, Andy becomes impatient and tells her that he doesn't have to sit home alone. Helen is indignant, of course, and brushes him off. Andy then calls Mavis Neff (a woman reputed to be \\"rather forward\\"), and arranges a date with her. When Mavis gets too close, Andy realizes his mistake and apologizes to Helen. In the episodes \\"Fun Girls\\" in Season Three and \\"The Arrest of the Fun Girls\\" in Season Four, Helen, along with Thelma Lou, both make assumptions and become unnecessarily jealous and break their dates with Andy and Barney when the \\"Fun Girls\\", Daphne and Skippy, both lavish unwelcome romantic attention on Andy and Barney, who both make clear that they have eyes only for their respective girlfriends Helen and Thelma Lou. In the first episode of The Andy Griffith Show spinoff, Mayberry R.F.D., Andy and Helen marry. Other characters from The Andy Griffith Show make guest appearances in the episode. The episode gave CBS the highest ratings for a new TV series debut for the decade. Andy and Helen in Return to Mayberry (1986). The couple move to Raleigh, North Carolina, but return to Mayberry at a later date on Mayberry R.F.D. to christen their newborn son, Andrew Samuel Taylor. In 1986, Andy and Helen made appearances in the reunion telemovie Return to Mayberry. In the telemovie, Andy has recently retired from the United States Postal Inspection Service in Cleveland and returns to Mayberry to see Opie and his wife become first-time parents.

The Quranic tradition is similar to the Judeo-Christian legend. The identification of Mount Judi as the landing site of the ark persisted in Syriac and Armenian tradition throughout Late Antiquity but was abandoned for the tradition equating the biblical location with the highest mountain of the region, Mount Ararat. Jewish Babylonian, Syriac, Islamic, and early Christian traditions identify Mount Judi or Qardu as a peak near the town of Jazirat ibn Umar (modern Cizre), at the headwaters of the Tigris, near the modern Syrian‚ÄìTurkish border. Arab historian Al-Masudi (d. 956), reported that the spot where the ark came to rest could be seen in his time. Al-Mas'udi locates Jabal Judi at 80 parasangs from the Tigris. Mount Judi was historically located in the province of Corduene, south of Lake Van. The mountains of this region, where Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran meet, are referred to as the 'Zagros'. Name The relation of some of the spellings is clear. The origin of Judi is less clear. It is usually interpreted as a corrupted version of the same name, via al-gurdi (Reynolds 2004). The proposal that the two names are ultimately the same was first advanced by the English Orientalist George Sale in his translation of the Qur'an published in 1734. Sale's footnote reads: Sale goes on to say that there was once a famous Christian monastery on the mountain, but that this was destroyed by lightning in the year 776 AD, following which Religious traditions Depiction of Noah's ark landing on the mountain top, from the North French Hebrew Miscellany (13th century) =Christianity= The Syrians of the east Tigris had a legend of the ark resting on the Dj√ªdi mountain in the land of Kard. This legend may in origin have been independent of the Genesis account of Noah's flood, rooted in the more general Near Eastern flood legends, but following Christianization of the Syrians, from about the 2nd century AD, it became associated with the Mountains of Ararat where Noah landed according to Genesis, and from Syria also this legend also spread to the Armenians. The Armenians did not traditionally associate Noah's landing site with Mount Ararat, known natively as Masis, but until the 11th century continued to associate Noah's ark with Mount Judi.Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare, review of Friedrich Murat, Ararat und Masis, Studien zur armenischen Altertumskunde und Litteratur, Heidelberg, 1900. Mount Judi is traditionally believed to be situated to the north-east of the Jazirat of Ibn 'Umar in south-east Turkey, close to the Iraqi and Syrian borders. The biblical Ararat is thought be a variation of Urartu, an ancient term for the region north of ancient Assyria which encompasses the Armenian plateau. According to Josephus, the Armenians in the 1st century showed the remains of Noah's ark at a place called Œ±œÄŒøŒ≤Œ±œÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ \\"Place of Descent\\" (, Nakhichevan, Ptolemy's ŒùŒ±ŒæŒøœÖŒ±ŒΩŒ±), about 60 miles southeast of the summit of Mount Ararat (ca. ).Conybeare (1901) The \\"mountains of Ararat\\" in Genesis have become identified in later (medieval) Christian tradition with the peak now known as Mount Ararat itself, a volcanic massif in Turkey and known in Turkish as \\"Agri Dagh\\" (Aƒürƒ± Daƒüƒ±). =Islam= The Quranic account of the Flood and Noah's Ark agrees with that given in Genesis, with a few variations. One of these concerns the final resting place of the Ark: according to Genesis, the Ark grounded on the \\"mountains of Ararat\\". According to the Qur'an (11:44), the final resting place of the vessel was called \\"Judi\\", without the word \\"mountain\\". The 9th century Arab geographer Ibn Khordadbeh identified the location of mount Judi as being in the land of Assyria (Al-Akrad), and the Abbasid historian Al-Mas'udi (c. 896-956) recorded that the spot where it came to rest could be seen in his time. Al-Mas'udi also said that the Ark began its voyage at Kufa in central Iraq, and sailed to Mecca, where it circled the Kaaba, before finally travelling to Judi. Yaqut al-Hamawi, also known as Al- Rumi, placed the mountain \\"above Jazirat ibn Umar, to the east of the Tigris,\\" and mentioned a mosque built by Noah that could be seen in his day, and the traveller Ibn Battuta passed by the mountain in the 14th century. Searches for the mountain The description of medieval geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi matches a peak north of Silopi, that is now called Jabal Judi or Judi Dagh by Muslims and Gardu by Christians and Jews.

Despite the name, the station is located in the neighborhood of Fort Hamilton (as its original name implied) at the intersection of 95th Street and Fourth Avenue in southwestern Brooklyn. It is served by the R train at all times. The station was first planned in 1922 as the first part of an extension to Staten Island through a tunnel under the Narrows. Construction began on December 17, 1923, after the construction contractor submitted, withdrew, and resubmitted its bid. The station opened on October 31, 1925, but the Staten Island extension was never built due to various funding disputes. The platform was lengthened in the 1960s. History A Forest Hills-bound R train leaving the station = Construction and opening = On August 25, 1922, the Transit Commission directed its chief engineer, Robert Ridgeway, to plan an extension of the Fourth Avenue Line from 87th Street to Fort Hamilton. Initially, multiple stations along the extension were considered. This extension was to be the first part of an extension to Staten Island through a tunnel under The Narrows. On September 12, 1922, a meeting was held by the Transit Commission to determine whether a stop at 91st Street should be included as part of the planned extension. Ultimately, no station was built at 91st Street. At the meeting it was decided that money for an additional station in between 86th Street and the new terminal at 95th Street would be better spent on an extensive terminal with entrances at 93rd, 94th, and 95th Streets. Other extensions were also planned in 1922: a branch of the line running via 86th Street to 18th Avenue to connect with the New Utrecht Line to Coney Island, Route 19, and the future subway under Tenth Avenue, as well as a branch of the line at 67th Street heading to Staten Island, Route 20. On December 28, 1922, the Transit Commission announced that it had awarded the contract for the construction of a half-mile extension of the Fourth Avenue Line, Contract 11B, to T. A. Gillespie Company for $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). However, as the Board of Estimate failed to take action upon it, the contractor withdrew its bid on March 7, 1923. The Transit Commission blamed the Board of Estimate for delays in the awarding of the contract; the Commission said that the city would suffer a substantial loss due to increased construction costs, and because the contract that was given was \\"highly advantageous to the city.\\" As part of Contract 11B, the extension was built with two tracks, with the exception of a short three-track stretch just north of the terminal at 95th Street. The extension was to be built with a provision to extend the line to Staten Island. As a result of a motion made by Commissioner LeRoy Harkness in front of the Transit Commission, the contract was set to be put back up for bid. On November 2, 1923, the Board of Estimate approved the contract for the line with T. A. Gillespie Company, the same contractor that had bid on the project earlier, but withdrew. The Transit Commission, due to the delay of the project, gave orders on November 3 to speed up the completion of the project. Construction began on December 17, 1923. The final extension to 95th Street, Route 18, opened on October 31, 1925, with the first train leaving at 2 p.m. =Platform extension= In the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn from to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including 95th Street, to W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions. The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between 45th Street and this station on May 3, 1968. However, work had already started on the platform extension project in February. The platform at 95th Street was extended by to the south. Station layout This underground station has two tracks and one island platform. The tracks end at bumper blocks at the south end of the platform. North of this station, a center layup track forms just north of the diamond crossover, before ending at a bumper block just south of 86th Street station. The R stops here at all times. The platform has yellow painted I-beam columns and alternate ones have \\"95 Street\\" signs on them. Both platform walls have their original mosaic trim line with name tablets reading \\"95TH STREET\\" along the entire station except for a small section at the north end, where the platform was extended in 1970. Here, the wall is bare black. The station was constructed with a signal tower and dispatcher's office. =Exits= alt=The station has two mezzanines above the platform and tracks. Mosaic directional signs indicate they were originally one full-length mezzanine. The closed-off sections are now used for employee- only spaces. The station's larger, full-time mezzanine is at the south end. It has two staircases from the platform, a turnstile bank, a token booth, and two restrooms. In addition, two staircases going up to either western corners of Fourth Avenue and 95th Street. A passageway leads to another staircase on the east side of the intersection, built inside an alcove of 9425 Fifth Avenue. The station's other mezzanine is unstaffed, containing one staircase from the platform, high entry/exit turnstiles, and two staircases going up to either southern corners of 93rd Street and Fourth Avenue. Additional exits were planned at 94th Street, but were never built. Provisions for proposed extensions Mosaic directional signs at the unstaffed mezzanine The station is built on the west side of Fourth Avenue due to plans for a possible extension of the express tracks south of 59th Street. This station had been built mainly to facilitate the Staten Island Tunnel or the \\"Narrows Tunnel\\", which would have necessitated express service, although the tunnel was never constructed. South of this station, there is a false wall at the end of the tracks for a planned extension to 100th or 101st Street and into the never- built Staten Island \\"Narrows Tunnel\\", connecting the BMT line with the Staten Island Railway (SIRT) Main Line near its Grasmere station. The station would have also connected with the now-defunct South Beach Branch by disconnecting it from the SIRT main line, with the BMT Fourth Avenue Subway taking over service from the SIRT's Fort Wadsworth station to the Wentworth Avenue terminal. At the time it would have been a very different line had this tunnel been built, with through BMT service from Queensboro Plaza to Wentworth Avenue in Staten Island stopping at this station before proceeding to Staten Island, since this station is also the closest point to Staten Island. There were also plans to construct an underground storage yard here. The SIRT had been electrified in preparation for the tunnel, and had purchased subway cars similar to the AB Standards of the BMT. The tunnel plan was amended in 1919, moving its location north to Shore Road in Bay Ridge. A groundbreaking ceremony was held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge and in Staten Island on July 19. In 1925, however‚Äîthe year bids from contractors were to be entertained by the city‚Äîthe project was halted and the project's engineering staff laid off. Officially, the plan was delayed due to lack of funding, but Hylan and New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) Chairman John Delaney also wanted to secure freight service for the tunnel. These disagreements caused deadlocks between the parties involved. Later proposals surfaced to connect the station to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, which follows the route of the planned tunnel. The bridge was completed in 1964 without provisions for rail traffic.

The term \\"brake horsepower\\" is one measurement of power derived from this method of measuring torque. (Power is calculated by multiplying torque by rotational speed.)The Design, Construction and Use of a Small Prony Brake Gas Engine Magazine Essentially the measurement is made by wrapping a cord or belt around the output shaft of the engine and measuring the force transferred to the belt through friction. The friction is increased by tightening the belt until the frequency of rotation of the shaft is reduced to a desired rotational speed. In practice more engine power can then be applied until the limit of the engine is reached. In its simplest form an engine is connected to a rotating drum by means of an output shaft. A friction band is wrapped around half the drum's circumference and each end attached to a separate spring balance. A substantial pre-load is then applied to the ends of the band, so that each spring balance has an initial and identical reading. When the engine is running, the frictional force between the drum and the band will increase the force reading on one balance and decrease it on the other. The difference between the two readings multiplied by the radius of the driven drum is equal to the torque. If the engine speed is measured with a tachometer, the brake horsepower is easily calculated. An alternate mechanism is to clamp a lever to the shaft and measure using a single balance. The torque is then related to the lever length, shaft diameter and measured force. The device is generally used over a range of engine speeds to obtain power and torque curves for the engine, since there is a non-linear relationship between torque and engine speed for most engine types. Power output in SI units may be calculated as follows: Rotary power (in newton-meters per second, N¬∑m/s) = 2œÄ √ó the distance from the center-line of the drum (the friction device) to the point of measurement (in meters, m) √ó rotational speed (in revolutions per second) √ó measured force (in newtons, N).Kemp‚Äôs Engineer‚Äôs Year BookReeds Applied Mechanics for Engineers Or in English units: Rotary power (in pound-feet per second, lbf¬∑ft/s) = 2œÄ √ó distance from center-line of the drum (the friction device) to the point of measurement (in feet, ft) √ó rotational speed (in revolutions per second) √ó measured force (in pounds, lbf).

The station serves the town of Muswellbrook and was designed by John Whitton, the Chief Engineer of NSW Railways. It is also known as Muswellbrook Railway Station and yard group and Musclebrook Railway Station. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History The single railway line from Singleton to, and station of \\"Musclebrook\\" was completed and opened on 19 May 1869, by the Earl of Belmore, Governor of NSW. Construction for the Muswellbrook section was awarded to George Blunt on 2 September 1864.CCG Architects, 2016, 9 The station was renamed on 1 September 1890. The line (formerly known as the Great Northern Railway) runs through the Central Coast, Hunter and New England regions. It was the original main line between Sydney and Brisbane, however this required a change of gauge at Wallangarra. The line is now closed north of Armidale, and the main Brisbane-Sydney route is now the North Coast line.CCG Architects, 2016, 9 The original 1869 John Whitton brick station building remains. The 1869 station building is one of several notable early stations attributed to Whitton during his long career with NSW Railways. It borrows heavily from his design experience in England and the influence of Georgian and Victorian architectural styles. Internally it comprised a Station Master's office, ticket office, waiting room, ladies room and lavatories.Cottee, 2004, quoted in CCG Architects, 2016, 9 Major changes and alterations included installation of a turntable in 1869 and its replacement by a larger one in 1890, lengthening of the platform and provision of an ash pit in 1891.CCG Architects, 2016, 9 It was not until 1890 that the Railways Department changed the station name to Muswellbrook. A gatehouse was built at the level crossing in 1892. In 1898 and 1911 the platform was extended and in 1909 a station master's residence was approved for 545 pounds.CCG Architects, 2016, 9 Muswellbrook railway precinct was expanded in the early 20th century with addition of the much larger two storey brick railway refreshment rooms immediately adjacent to the station building.CCG Architects, 2016, 9 The refreshment rooms were commissioned in 1922, opened the same year. At the time, the Singleton Argus reported:Singleton Argus, 19 October 1922, 2, via www.trove.nla.gov.au In 1927 the Refreshment Rooms were extended, altered to include five bedrooms for the public. This building replaced the rest houses, which had been transferred from Murrurundi and Singleton and re-erected at Muswellbrook in 1918. The subway underpass was constructed in 1928 as a replacement for the level crossing at the Sydney end of the station.CCG Architects, 2016, 10 An overbridge was built on Bridge Street, replacing the level crossing. Meanwhile, a locomotive depot had been built in 1943. In 1977 a coal mine at Ulan was opened and the railway was extended from Sandy Hollow to Ulan in 1982 to transport coal to Newcastle, via Muswellbrook.CCG Architects, 2016, 10 For a number of years in the 1980s, the passenger services were replaced by road coaches while the line was upgraded. Rail services were restored on 14 March 1988. In 2007 approval was given for 2-staged refurbishment of the railway refreshment room as a museum; provision of stair & entry ramp and install lift, then for construction of a stand-alone visitor information centre, storeroom, toilets, deck & landscaping. In 2011 approval was given to demolish the disused signal box. Muswellbrook formerly had an extensive freight yard including a locomotive roundhouse. The Merriwa section of the Ulan line branches off the Main Northern line at the northern end of the yard. In early 2007, the Australian Rail Track Corporation commenced work to rationalise the tracks within the yard and add a passing loop long enough to accommodate long trains. Upon completion, freight trains are to pass through the yard area at , improving travel times. In March 2009, duplication of the Main Northern line reached Muswellbrook station, the completion of a project to upgrade the line to double track between Antiene and Muswellbrook to improve coal haulage capacity.St Heliers to Muswellbrook Duplication Commissioning Australian Rail Track Corporation 17 March 2009\\"In Brief: Duplication reaches Muswellbrook after 59 years\\" Railway Digest June 2009 Platforms & services The station has one platform and a disused dock platform at the southern end. Muswelbrook is serviced by NSW TrainLink Hunter Line services travelling between Newcastle and Scone. It is also served by NSW TrainLink Xplorer services from Sydney to Armidale and Moree.  Description  The station complex comprises a type 3, second class brick station building, completed in 1869. The original station building was a small well proportioned brick structure with simple stone lintels and hipped roof. It is a rendered brick building with a hipped roof of corrugated, galvanised iron (originally slate). The building is elevated above street level. Its entrance is via steps leading to a stone flagged verandah with a hipped roof of corrugated galvanised iron, supported by timber posts. The verandah roof to the street is original. The doors are timber with moulded panels and window frames are timber, double-hung sash type. The platform awning is an extension of the awning built at the time of construction of the adjacent refreshment room building. It is a cast iron, cantilevered awning of corrugated, galvanised iron.CCG Architects, 2016 The internal layout has changed since originally constructed, consisting today of a store room, waiting room, female toilets and male toilets.CCG Architects, 2016 The refreshment rooms, were completed in 1921‚Äì2, with additions -8. This two storey building is located immediately adjacent to the station building. Two hipped roofs clad in diamond pattern slate tiles with terracotta ridge capping and ram's head finials. The ground floor projects outward from under the first floor, so that a portion has its own roof. The roofs are finished with timber barge boards and painted rough-cast infill. The chimneys are also rough-cast cement. Tuck-pointed brickwork, timber moulded panel doors, some with transom windows, timber double-hung sash windows bordered with stone lintels and ornate, rendered sills and pressed metal cornices. The layout consists of refreshment rooms and kitchens on the ground floor with passenger accommodation on the upper floor, with associated bathrooms and linen stores. Internally the building features pressed metal cornices and ceilings, hardwood floors, a pine staircase and balustrade.CCG Architects, 2016, 11 The type 4 elevated signal box with a hip roof was completed in 1923. It is an elevated, two storey signal box on a timber frame, with pre-cast concrete and asbestos cement cladding. Lower floor comprises a drop-in, pre-cast concrete panel between concrete uprights and conventional timber-framed construction on the upper floor. A hipped roof with broad overhanging eaves, clad in fibro asbestos laid in a diamond pattern and terracotta ridge capping. WIndow frames are timber, double-hung sash with between 6 and 9 panes. Access is va a steel ladder and there is a toilet on the upper landing.CCG Architects, 2016, 12 Other structures include a brick- faced platform, completed in 1869; a carriage dock, also completed in 1869, that was used for parcel and mail vans;CCG Architects, 2016, 11 and the remains of a locomotive depot, completed in 1943, including a turntable, a T145 jib crane, located within a shed, erected in 1869; and a timber loading bank. = Modifications and dates = Changes of level of the rear of both station and refreshment room buildings have occurred after construction, as follows:CCG, 2016 *1865station building, platform, carriage dock, crane. *Early 20th centuryextension of station building to Sydney end, adding Station Master's room (back-to-back fireplace with existing (formerly external) fireplace in what is now a store room, was a parcel room).

Heritage listing  The station group represents an excellent example of an early complex surviving in its basic form and adapted with the addition of other structures as passengers increased. The first station building can be clearly seen with its rare example of an early street verandah and most of its detailing intact. The refreshment room is a good example of a type of building that thrived and are no longer in use. They are significant community buildings in the townscape, dominating the skyline with the bulk of the refreshment rooms. The signal box adds significance to the group and is itself a good example of a later elevated signal box.

It was built by American Bridge Company and opened on October 21, 1981. Its center span is long and the side spans are each long. The bridge deck contains two vehicle lanes and a pedestrian sidewalk. It crosses above the river. The bridge is owned by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Builder's plaque from the original Sewickley Bridge, preserved in a park in Sewickley. The current bridge is the second bridge to occupy the site; the original Sewickley Bridge opened September 19, 1911, after 26 months of construction. The bridge was a lattice-beam cantilever truss design, built by the Fort Pitt Bridge Works and officially named the Ohio River Bridge No. 1. By the late 1970s, the bridge had deteriorated badly. The bridge was closed for emergency repairs from January 30 to May 20, 1977, and also from January 11 to March 2, 1979. A replacement bridge was ordered and the design was completed in late 1979. The old Sewickley Bridge closed for the last time on May 14, 1980. To reduce construction costs, the piers from the original bridge were reused for the new bridge. This meant that the old bridge had to be completely demolished before the new bridge could be built. The central suspended span was lowered onto barges and floated away, while the rest of the bridge was dismantled piece by piece to maintain balance of the cantilever arms. The crossing was closed for a total of 17 months before the new bridge opened. The new bridge mimicked the old bridge's shape and scale, although it used box members instead of lattice beams and was of a continuous truss design instead of a cantilever-and-suspended-span design. Finial of the original Sewickley Bridge, preserved in a park in Sewickley. Postcard photo of the original Sewickley Bridge in 1910. The original bridge was capped by four decorative finial spires; these were saved and put on public display. One sits in a park in downtown Sewickley, along with the keystone-shaped builder's plaque from the original bridge. Another is near the old Sewickley train station between Route 65 and the river, near the north end of the current bridge; the third spire is at Station Square in Pittsburgh. The fourth is on display across the river in Coraopolis. The location of the bridge is (40.5331234¬∞, -80.1878365¬∞), at an elevation of .

Early career Stokes majored in Cinema Production at the University of Southern California. After working as a puppeteer for several years, he was hired as the head puppeteer on the 1988 remake of The Blob. This led to many other film puppeteering jobs, including Species, RoboCop 2, and eventually head puppeteer on The Abyss. In 1989, he designed the computer animation assistants for Crash Bandicoot at Pixar Animation Studios. In 1990, he designed the motion simulation and supervised the ride film for The Funtastic World of Hanna- Barbera at Universal Studios Florida. In 1995, Stokes was hired as the animation department supervisor for Tippett Studio, and worked on the films Starship Troopers and My Favorite Martian (film). Stokes gained some notoriety for helping debunk Fox Network's Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction? as a hoax with his article \\"How to Build an Alien\\". Stokes published the opinions of 15 of his movie industry colleagues about the claimed alien autopsy footage, and all 15 felt the film was a fake. Many, according to Stokes, found the footage so laughable that they couldn't believe that anyone in the business would take it seriously enough to even do a survey about it. Star Wars fan films After meeting and teaming up with actress Amy Earhart in 2000 for the now- defunct Aliendog web series, Stokes began directing short films of his own, often in 48-hour film competitions. His 48-hour films, all featuring Earhart, include The Untitled Russian Film, Land of Many Uses, Fish Guys, and Double Shot. One of the many shorts Stokes and Earhart collaborated on was a 2002 Star Wars spoof entitled Pink Five. Originally intended as a bluescreen test project, the film became an internet hit beyond their expectations. The film was featured on CNN, and became one of the most popular downloads on Ifilm and TheForce.net. In 2003, Pink Five moved to AtomFilms as part of The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, where the film was picked by George Lucas as the grand prize winner of that year's competition. As part of the prize, Stokes travelled to Skywalker Ranch, where the film was remixed at Skywalker Sound. Recent work In 2003, Stokes programmed the motion simulators for Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast! at Universal Studios Orlando, and also served as an animation supervisor for the film that accompanied the ride. Later that year, Stokes directed Hooves of Destiny for the National Film Challenge, and the film won three awards, and was named one of the competition's ten best films of 2003. In 2004, Stokes worked as a lead motion capture integrator for The Polar Express and also worked as a puppeteer on Team America: World Police. Also that year, his short film Woody Burns: A Life won the Grand Prize in the National Film Challenge, and the Pink Five sequel (Pink Five Strikes Back) was picked as the Audience Choice winner in that year's official Star Wars fan film contest. In 2005, Stokes worked with filmmaker John E. Hudgens on his films Sith Apprentice and American Scary. He also appeared as a Tellarite in two of the final episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise because members of the Trek production crew were fans of the Pink Five films, and invited Stokes and Earhart to appear on the show. Stokes reteamed with Earhart to complete the Pink Five saga with the eagerly awaited Return of Pink Five, which is now in post-production. Most recently, Stokes was a consultant on Universal Studios' The Simpsons Ride and directed the webseries Ark, and the feature film 2010: Moby Dick, both starring Renee O'Connor. =Podcasting= Stokes is also a regular panelist on the podcast What Are You Doing, Movie? (formerly Down In Front), which produces alternative audio commentaries for films.  References  External links *Official website *Pink Five Official website * *What Are You Doing, Movie?

Biography =Early years= Benjamin Randall III was born February 7, 1749, at New Castle, New Hampshire to sea captain Benjamin Randall, Jr. (born 1712), and his wife, the former Margaret Mordantt.Frederick Levi Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall: Founder of the Free Baptist Denomination. Philadelphia: American Baptist Publication Society, 1915; pg. 5. He was the oldest of 9 children born to the pair, both of whom were of ethnic English heritage. Randall was provided with a \\"good commercial education\\" in the primitive public schools of the day, supplemented with extensive personal reading.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 7. A considerable part of Randall's youth was spent as a cabin boy aboard his father's ship, but he did not enjoy the experience, being a sensitive and pious youth who read the Bible daily.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 8. At the age of 17 Randall was apprenticed to a sailmaker in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with whom he remained until the age of 21.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 9. He parlayed the sewing skills he developed as a sailmaker to the profession of tailoring, becoming proficient at the craft, and occasionally venturing to the related craft of tent-making when such work was to be found.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 10. On September 23, 1770, Christian evangelist George Whitefield paid a visit to Portsmouth as part of his last speaking tour of the country, arriving barely a week before his death.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 12. Randall heard Whitefield's sermons several times and was shaken and moved by news of his death.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 14. A short period of religious meditation followed with the effect that Randall's piety was awakened and he was himself energized as an evangelist of Christianity.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 16. Despite his religious awakening, Randall continued to work in Marblehead and Salem, Massachusetts during 1771, returning to his native New Castle in the fall of that year to set up shop as a sailmaker in October of that year.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 23. In November 1771 he married Joanna Oram (born 1748) of Kittery, Maine, the daughter of another sea captain.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 24. In 1772 Randall and his wife became members of the Congregationalist church of New Castle, but he soon came to find it unfulfilling, finding himself possessed of a zealous religious passion and determination to save souls that was not reciprocated by his fellow congregants.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 26. In the spring of 1774 Randall pushed the idea of conducting open meetings which might be attended by a broader public, who could be drawn into the church through the reading of printed sermons, public prayer, and singing.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 27. The holding of public meetings by laymen soon drew the ire of the local church pastor, who quickly came to regard Randall as a rival.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 29. This drama would be interrupted by the coming of the American Revolutionary War. =Military interlude= Randall was an ardent American patriot during the revolutionary crisis of 1775 to 1776, and with the outbreak of armed hostilities he briefly enlisted in the Massachusetts militia in the company of Captain John Parsons at New Castle during the first half of 1775.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pp. 30-31. The immediate crisis subsided, however, and the company was soon dismissed.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 31. Following another brief scare in the fall of 1775 Randall again enlisted for a term of two months as an assistant commissary.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pp. 31-32. He would reenlist in September 1776 as a sergeant in a regiment headed by Colonel Pierce Lang, ultimately serving as a militia soldier for a year and a half.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 33. Randall remained devout in his Christianity during his military stint, later declaring that he \\"never lived nearer to God than during that campaign experience.\\" During his military tenure Randall made a point of regularly visiting the sick and performing the duties of a chaplain in offering religious consolation.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 34. Randall was mocked by some within the ranks for his religious exuberance but his actions were ultimately backed by the unit's commanding officer, who threatened severe punishment to any who continued to deride Randall's heartfelt efforts, thereby easing the situation.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 35. =Religious conversion= In 1776 Randall found himself in fundamental agreement with the evangelical teachings of the Calvinistic Baptists, and he joined this comparatively small, isolated, and unpopular sect, which believed in active evangelism and the doctrine of baptism by immersion.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 37. He soon was an active participant in the Baptist church, reading published sermons and becoming a layman preacher of original sermons in 1777.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 43. Randall was a zealous public speaker on behalf of his faith, holding public meetings day and night and preaching an average of four times a week.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 46. Some 30 people were converted at Randall's revival meetings, which were non-standard in form and perceived as a threat by many in the community.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 49. Randall later recalled that \\"persecution grew very hot, and such threatening language was used that I really felt my life in danger.\\" He was nearly struck in the head with a thrown piece of a brick when walking down the street one day, narrowly escaping death or serious injury when the shard grazed his hair.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pp. 49-50. Randall spent the summer of 1777 traveling farther and farther afield on preaching tours throughout the New England region.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 57. In March 1778 Randall and his family left New Castle for a new home in New Durham, New Hampshire, where they would settle for the rest of Randall's life.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pp. 59-60. Randall became the only resident preacher in the town, his predecessor having recently resigned over a salary dispute.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 60. The people of the community built a meeting house for their new religious leader, who maintained himself through the voluntary contributions of his congregation and various odd jobs in tailoring, also tending a small household farm.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 62. He would continue to travel and preach to outlying communities, making New Durham his base of operations.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 63. =Break with Calvinism= Benjamin Randall's grave Randall's theological orientation tended towards the idea of rapid salvation, freely available to all who repented of their sins and believed.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 65. This idea of free salvation proved to be in conflict with the fundamental doctrines of Calvinism, including predestination, which dominated the official Baptist church. Orthodox followers of the church's doctrine charged Randall with teaching anti- Calvinist doctrines, prompting his split from the church in 1780.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 75. On April 5, 1780 Randall was ordained in New Durham, which was at the time performed by two ordained ministers in good standing laying hands upon the candidate.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 79. Two such local ministers were found and Randall was thereby officially qualified for the ministry, given the honorific \\"Elder,\\" a title commonly given to gospel ministers in the day.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pg. 81. In June 1780, new Articles of Faith and Church Covenant were drawn up by Randall in New Durham and the first Free Baptist church was established ‚Äî although for the first two decades after this date no prefix to the Baptist name was used.Wiley, Life and Influence of the Rev. Benjamin Randall, pp. 82-83. By the end of the year the church numbered seven men and thirteen women. Randall's doctrine was based upon the notion that human beings had minds which provided them the free will to act and that God was ready to fully forgive behavioral errors resulting from that free volition.Rupp, An Original History of the Religious Denominations at Present Existing in the United States, Containing Authentic Accounts of their Rise, Progress, Statistics, and Doctrines... Philadelphia: J.Y. Humphreys, 1844; pg. 59. Complete atonement for sin was available to all based upon genuine repentance, which was a requirement of God.Rupp, An Original History of the Religious Denominations at Present Existing in the United States, pp. 59-60. The duty of religious exhortation to make known that free salvation was available for any to embrace were fundamental pillars of Randall's belief.Rupp, An Original History of the Religious Denominations at Present Existing in the United States, pg. 60. Randall and his followers were dismissed by many contemporaries as adherents of a fanatical sect and were pejoratively called a variety of names, including \\"Randallites,\\" \\"General Provisioners,\\" \\"New-Lights,\\" and \\"Freewillers.\\" =Death and legacy= From the time of his lay preaching until his death of tuberculosis on October 22, 1808, Randall was instrumental in planting many Freewill Baptist churches throughout New England.

Current bridges  A decision to replace the original bridge was made in 1939 just prior to the outbreak of World War II. Design work began in 1942 and construction by Hornibrook McKenzie Clarke Pty Ltd commenced in 1947. The bridge was officially opened by the Hon. J.J. Cahill, MLA, Premier and Colonial Treasurer of NSW on 30 July 1955. The Pratt truss bridge was built to carry four lanes of traffic, however a fifth lane was later added to the southwest side of the bridge. This extra lane runs outside of the main bridge supports, forcing traffic to remain in the lane for the length of the bridge. The default configuration was three westbound and two eastbound lanes, switching to two westbound and three eastbound lanes during the morning peak. Designed by Laurie Challis from the NSW Department of Main Roads, the Iron Cove Bridge is an impressive steel truss bridge. It consists of four plate girder approach spans and seven steel Pratt truss spans for a total length of . Four lanes of traffic are located within the truss spans and the overall width of the roadway is between kerbs. The roadway consists of a reinforced concrete deck slab with an inset for tram tracks in the centre portion. The bridge has aesthetically distinctive piers and abutments which reflect the Inter-War Art Deco style. Furthermore, it was the last steel truss bridge to be constructed in New South Wales in which rivets were used for field connections prior to the introduction of high strength bolts. =Bridge duplication= In April 2009, the NSW Government approved plans to construct a second bridge over Iron Cove as part of the Inner West Busway along Victoria Road. The new bridge was constructed on the western side of the existing bridge and holds three westbound traffic lanes with one lane designated as a morning peak bus lane. The existing bridge now carries three city bound traffic lanes and a 24-hour bus lane. The existing outrigger lane has been closed and is now only used for maintenance reasons. There is also a grade- separated shared pedestrian footpath and cycleway on the western side of the new bridge which connects to both The Bay Run and Victoria Road. Work on the duplicate bridge commenced in July 2009 and was opened to traffic late on 28 January 2011. During the proposal phase there were strong protests against the duplicate bridge being built from local residents as well as both local area councils of the City of Canada Bay (Drummoyne side) and Leichhardt (Rozelle side). Local residents within both Drummoyne and Rozelle formed the Victoria Road Community and organised public demonstrations, the last of which on 29 March 2009 attracted over 3000 protest marchers. Opposition to the new bridge was based on independent evaluations concluding that there would be only slight improvements to traffic congestion city bound on Victoria Road during peak hour while local congestion would worsen. Additionally, parkland on both sides of the new bridge would be reduced and independent environmental studies showed the local environment detrimentally impacted by the new bridge construction.  First bridge  The original bridge was constructed of wrought iron lattice girders and opened in 1882 after four years of construction. The area was sparsely populated in the 1880s and the opening of the new bridge not only helped accessibility but also provided a new western route to Sydney via Balmain. The old spans were re-used by means of purchase by Gordon Duff. Because of their good resistance to corrosion, all nine of the 1882 bridge's spans are in current use in three bridges on country roads in the area. All that remains in place of the original bridge are the sandstone abutments situated on both sides of the cove approximately south of the current bridge. The abutment on the Drummoyne side is listed on the local government heritage list.

He previously wrote for The New York Times and before that the Associated Press on baseball and sports legal and labor relations. In 2003 the Baseball Writers' Association of America honored him with the J. G. Taylor Spink Award where he is honored in Cooperstown, NY in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. He took a buyout from the Times, along with Supreme Court writer Linda Greenhouse and dozens of others, in April 2008. Chass graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1960 with a bachelor's degree in political science where he was a writer and editor for the Pitt News.Interview at fangraphs.com In 1956 he \\"audaciously\\" made an appointment with the editor of the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette to pursue his \\"future of a newspaperman\\". He joined the Baseball Writers' Association of America in 1962, when he worked for the Associated Press in Pittsburgh. He joined the New York Times in 1969, and started covering the New York Yankees the following year. In 1986, he was made the paper's national baseball writer. Chass was also inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Western Pennsylvania Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh in 2004. From 1979‚Äì1980 he served as chairman of the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Chass has authored numerous books on the business, labor and legal relations of sports, baseball in particular, among his works: The Yankees: The Four Fabulous Eras of Baseball's Most Famous Team, which was published by Random House in 1979; Power Football, published by Dutton in 1973, and Pittsburgh Steelers: The Long Climb, published by Prentice Hall in 1973. He has contributed to Great Pro Football Games and Greatest Basketball Games. He also authored several articles in Dutton's Best Sports Stories series. During his nearly 40 years writing for The New York Times, Chass covered the entirety of the George Steinbrenner regime, and he made it through the George and Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson years, ending his daily coverage of the Yankees at the end of the 1986 season. During that period he reported three of his four all-time favorite quotes. The fourth came more recently: * ‚ÄúThe two of them deserve each other; one's a born liar, the other's convicted‚Äù ‚Äî Billy Martin on Reggie Jackson and Steinbrenner in 1978. * ‚ÄúThere's nothing more limited than a limited partner in the Yankees‚Äù ‚Äî John McMullen, then the Houston Astros owner but once a limited partner of Steinbrenner, in 1979. * ‚ÄúWhere is Reggie Jackson? We need a Mr. October or a Mr. September. Winfield is Mr. May.‚Äù ‚Äî George Steinbrenner in September 1985. * ‚ÄúThe Evil Empire extends its tentacles even into Latin America‚Äù ‚Äî Larry Lucchino, Red Sox chief executive, in 2002. Chass made some other significant contributions to baseball writing. For one, he created the coverage of contracts. Salaries in sports had been largely guess work before he began reporting contracts of baseball's free agents once free agency began in 1976. For another, he pioneered the intensive coverage of baseball labor negotiations, later covering labor matters in the other three major sports as well. Chass was one of the early authors of a Sunday baseball notebook and was unique in writing the notebook throughout the year, not just during the baseball season. From August 1984, through March 2008 he wrote 1,155 Sunday notebooks, developing more than 4,000 items ranging in length from one paragraph to more than 1,000 words. In January 2004 he switched from reporting baseball news to writing baseball columns, writing from two to five columns a week. Chass is a noted baseball traditionalist who laments the shift in baseball news coverage from daily beat-report biographies to more statistics-driven analysis like sabermetrics. In 2007, Chass asserted that, among \\"certain topics that should be off-limits,\\" are \\"statistics mongers promoting VORP and other new-age baseball statistics.\\" Chass particularly believes that in \\"their attempt to introduce these new-age statistics into the game,\\" these \\"statistics mongers\\" threaten \\"to undermine most fans' enjoyment of baseball and the human factor therein.\\" Baseball Prospectus editor Nate Silver published an open letter responding to Chass' comments. In 2008, Chass started a website, \\"Murray Chass on Baseball\\" where he has written nearly 1,000 columns similar to what he has written for The New York Times. Chass is a voter for the Baseball Hall of Fame, and turned in a blank ballot for the 2017 HOF class.

Justin Cartwright Biography Cartwright was born in Cape Town, South Africa, but grew up in Johannesburg where his father was the editor of the Rand Daily Mail newspaper. He was educated in South Africa, the United States and at Trinity College, Oxford. Cartwright worked in advertising and directed documentaries, films and television commercials. He managed election broadcasts, first for the Liberal Party and then the SDP-Liberal Alliance during the 1979, 1983 and 1987 British general elections. For his work on election broadcasts, Cartwright was appointed an MBE. Australian Broadcasting Corporation presenter Ramona Koval described Cartwright's novels as being \\"based in contemporary settings but he‚Äôs able to suffuse them with the big questions that haunt us\\". Three of Cartwright's early novels feature a character named Timothy Curtiz, named partly for Kurtz from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and partly for Cartwright's own brother. In Interior, Curtiz is in Africa investigating the disappearance of his father in 1959 while on a trip for National Geographic. In Look At It This Way, Curtiz is a columnist for Manhattan magazine while he is living in London, has a daughter named Gemma, and by the end of the novel has a partner named Victoria. In Masai Dreaming, Curtiz is in Africa researching a film about Claudia Cohn-Casson, and his relationship with Victoria is having \\"complications.\\" Look At It This Way was made into a three- part, 180-minutes drama by the BBC in 1992, starring Kristin Scott Thomas; Cartwright wrote the screenplay. In Every Face I Meet was shortlisted for both the Booker Prize and the Whitbread Novel Award in 1995, and won a Commonwealth Writers Prize; Leading the Cheers won the Whitbread Novel Award in 1998; White Lightning was shortlisted for the Whitbread Novel Award in 2002. Masai Dreaming won the South African M-Net Literary Awards. The Promise of Happiness was chosen as one of Richard and Judy's Book Club's titles for 2005 and was the winner of the 2005 Hawthornden Prize and the Sunday Times Fiction Prize of South Africa. Cartwright lived in London with his wife, Penny, and two sons.

The conflict is also known as the US war in Afghanistan. Its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and deny it a safe base of operations in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power. and The United Kingdom was a key ally of the United States, offering support for military action from the start of preparations for the invasion. It followed the Afghan Civil War's 1996‚Äì2001 phase between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance groups, although the Taliban controlled 90% of the country by 2001. The US invasion of Afghanistan became the first phase of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent). US President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda; bin Laden had already been wanted by the FBI since 1998. The Taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks, and ignored demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects apart from bin Laden. The request was dismissed by the US as a meaningless delaying tactic, and it launched Operation Enduring Freedom on October 7, 2001 with the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance troops on the ground. The US and its allies rapidly drove the Taliban from power by December 17, 2001, and built military bases near major cities across the country. Most al-Qaeda and Taliban members were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions during the Battle of Tora Bora. In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to oversee military operations in the country and train Afghan National Security Forces. At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga (grand assembly) in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. In August 2003, NATO became involved as an alliance, taking the helm of ISAF. One portion of US forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct US command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement, and in 2002, it launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF that continues to this day. Origins of Afghanistan's civil war Afghanistan's political order began to break down with the overthrow of King Zahir Shah by his cousin Mohammed Daoud Khan in a bloodless 1973 coup. Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, emancipation of women, and Pashtun nationalism. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive Pashtun population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto began to encourage Afghan Islamic leaders, such as Burhanuddin Rabbani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in a coup by Afghan's Communist Party, his former partner in government, known as the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition from Islamic leaders across rural areas, but it was particularly the PDPA's crackdown that contributed to open rebellion, including Ismail Khan's Herat Uprising. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on September 11, 1979, when Hafizullah Amin ousted Nur Muhammad Taraki. The Soviet Union, sensing PDPA weakness, intervened militarily three months later, to depose Amin and install another PDPA faction led by Babrak Karmal. Soviet troops in 1986, during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War The entry of the Soviet Union into Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its Cold War rivals, the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China, to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated mujahideen held sway in much of the countryside. Beside Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included Jalaluddin Haqqani. The CIA worked closely with Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \\"Afghan Arabs\\", including Osama bin Laden. After the withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan in May 1989, the PDPA regime under Najibullah held on until 1992, when the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostum cleared the approach to Kabul. With the political stage cleared of Afghan socialists, the remaining Islamic warlords vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country. The United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished. =Warlord rule (1992‚Äì1996)= In 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul. In late 1994, Rabbani's defense minister, Ahmad Shah Massoud, defeated Hekmatyr in Kabul and ended ongoing bombardment of the capital. Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation. Other warlords, including Ismail Khan in the west and Dostum in the north, maintained their fiefdoms. In 1994, Mullah Omar, a Pashtun mujahideen who taught at a Pakistani madrassa, returned to Kandahar and founded the Taliban. His followers were religious students, known as the Talib, and they sought to end warlord-ism through strict adherence to Islamic law. By November 1994, the Taliban had captured all of Kandahar Province. They declined the government's offer to join in a coalition government and marched on Kabul in 1995. =Taliban Emirate vs. Northern Alliance= The Taliban's early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of costly defeats. Pakistan provided strong support to the Taliban. Analysts such as Amin Saikal described the group as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan's regional interests, which the Taliban denied. The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995, but were driven back by Massoud. On September 27, 1996, the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They imposed their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school, or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative. According to the Pakistani expert Ahmed Rashid, \\"between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan\\" on the side of the Taliban.Peter Tomsen said that up until 9/11, Pakistani military and ISI officers, along with thousands of regular Pakistani armed forces personnel, had been involved in the fighting in Afghanistan. Massoud and Dostum, former arch-enemies, created a United Front against the Taliban, commonly known as the Northern Alliance. In addition to Massoud's Tajik force and Dostum's Uzbeks, the United Front included Hazara factions and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq and Haji Abdul Qadir. Abdul Haq also gathered a limited number of defecting Pashtun Taliban. Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which the journalist Steve Coll referred to as the \\"grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance\\", said, \\"It's crazy that you have this today ‚Ä¶ Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ‚Ä¶ They were all ready to buy in to the process ‚Ä¶ to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan.\\" The Northern Alliance received varying degrees of support from Russia, Iran, Tajikistan and India. The Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998 and drove Dostum into exile. The conflict was brutal. According to the United Nations (UN), the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians. UN officials stated that there had been \\"15 massacres\\" between 1996 and 2001. The Taliban especially targeted the Shiite Hazaras. In retaliation for the killing of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by Uzbek general Abdul Malik Pahlawan in 1997, the Taliban killed about 4,000 civilians after taking Mazar- i-Sharif in 1998. Bin Laden's so-called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass- killings of Afghan civilians. The report by the United Nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing \\"Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people\\". By 2001, the Taliban controlled as much as 90% of the country, with the Northern Alliance confined to the country's northeast corner. Fighting alongside Taliban forces were some 28,000‚Äì30,000 Pakistanis and 2,000‚Äì3,000 Al Qaeda militants. Many of the Pakistanis were recruited from madrassas. A 1998 document by the US State Department confirmed that \\"20‚Äì40 percent of [regular] Taliban soldiers are Pakistani.\\" The document said that many of the parents of those Pakistani nationals \\"know nothing regarding their child's military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan\\". According to the US State Department report and reports by Human Rights Watch, other Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan were regular soldiers, especially from the Frontier Corps, but also from the army providing direct combat support. The 055 Brigade had at least 500 men during the time of the invasion, at least 1,000 more Arabs were believed to have arrived in Afghanistan following the September 11 Attacks, crossing over from Pakistan and Iran, many were based at Jalalabad, Khost, Kandahar and Mazar-i Sharif. There were rumors in the weeks before the September 11 attacks that Juma Namangani, had been appointed as one of the top commanders in the 055 brigade. Al-Qaeda In August 1996, Bin Laden was forced to leave Sudan and arrived in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. He had founded al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to support the mujahideen's war against the Soviets, but became disillusioned by infighting among warlords. He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan. The 9/11 Commission in the US reported found that under the Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists, and plot terrorist actions. While al-Qaeda maintained its own camps in Afghanistan, it also supported training camps of other organizations. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front. A smaller number were inducted into al-Qaeda. After the August 1998 US Embassy bombings were linked to bin Laden, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes on militant training camps in Afghanistan. US officials pressed the Taliban to surrender bin Laden. In 1999, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on the Taliban, calling for Bin Laden to be surrendered. The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed these demands, though there were reports about attempts to negotiate the delivery of Bin Laden by the Taliban.http://www.counterpunch.org/2004/11/01/how-bush-was-offered-bin- laden-and-blew-it/Kabir Mohabbat Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Special Activities Division paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden. These teams planned several operations, but did not receive the order to proceed from President Clinton. Their efforts built relationships with Afghan leaders that proved essential in the 2001 invasion. Change in US policy toward Afghanistan During the Clinton administration, the US tended to favor Pakistan and until 1998‚Äì1999 had no clear policy toward Afghanistan. In 1997, for example, the US State Department's Robin Raphel told Massoud to surrender to the Taliban. Massoud responded that, as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat, he would continue to defend it from the Taliban. Around the same time, top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to try to persuade the United Front not to take advantage of a chance to make crucial gains against the Taliban. They insisted it was the time for a cease-fire and an arms embargo. At the time, Pakistan began a \\"Berlin-like airlift to resupply and re-equip the Taliban\\", financed with Saudi money. US policy toward Afghanistan changed after the 1998 US embassy bombings. Subsequently, Osama bin Laden was indicted for his involvement in the embassy bombings. In 1999 both the US and the United Nations enacted sanctions against the Taliban via United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267, which demanded the Taliban surrender Osama bin Laden for trial in the US and close all terrorist bases in Afghanistan. The only collaboration between Massoud and the US at the time was an effort with the CIA to trace bin Laden following the 1998 bombings. The US and the European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban. By 2001 the change of policy sought by CIA officers who knew Massoud was underway. CIA lawyers, working with officers in the Near East Division and Counter-terrorist Center, began to draft a formal finding for President George W. Bush's signature, authorizing a covert action program in Afghanistan. It would be the first in a decade to seek to influence the course of the Afghan war in favor of Massoud. Richard A. Clarke, chair of the Counter-Terrorism Security Group under the Clinton administration, and later an official in the Bush administration, allegedly presented a plan to incoming Bush National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in January 2001. A change in US policy was effected in August 2001. The Bush administration agreed on a plan to start supporting Massoud. A meeting of top national security officials agreed that the Taliban would be presented with an ultimatum to hand over bin Laden and other al-Qaeda operatives. If the Taliban refused, the US would provide covert military aid to anti-Taliban groups. If both those options failed, \\"the deputies agreed that the United States would seek to overthrow the Taliban regime through more direct action.\\" Northern Alliance on the eve of 9/11 Ahmad Shah Massoud was the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan. In the areas under his control, Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Women's Rights Declaration. As a consequence, many civilians had fled to areas under his control. In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban. In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss \\"a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan\\". That part of the Pashtun-Tajik- Hazara-Uzbek peace plan did eventually develop. Among those in attendance was Hamid Karzai.Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert Peter Tomsen wrote: \\"The 'Lion of Kabul' [Abdul Haq] and the 'Lion of Panjshir' [Ahmad Shah Massoud] ‚Ä¶ Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan's three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun‚Äînon-Pashtun, north-south divide.\\" In early 2001, Massoud, with other ethnic leaders, addressed the European Parliament in Brussels, asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan. He said that the Taliban and al-Qaeda had introduced \\"a very wrong perception of Islam\\" and that without the support of Pakistan and Osama bin Laden, the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for another year. On this visit to Europe, he warned that his intelligence had gathered information about an imminent, large-scale attack on US soil. On September 9, 2001, Massoud was critically wounded in a suicide attack by two Arabs posing as journalists, who detonated a bomb hidden in their video camera during an interview in Khoja Bahauddin, in the Takhar Province of Afghanistan. Massoud died in the helicopter taking him to a hospital. The funeral, held in a rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning Afghans. =September 11, 2001 attacks= attacks of 11 September 2001 On the morning of September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda carried out four coordinated attacks on the United States, employing four commercial passenger jet airliners that were hijacked. The hijackers ‚Äì members of al- Qaeda's Hamburg cell\\"Chapter of the 9/11 Commission Report detailing the history of the Hamburg Cell\\". 9/11 Commission. ‚Äì intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C., to target the White House or the United States Capitol. No flights had survivors. In total, 2,996 people died, including the 19 hijackers, and more than 6,000 others were injured in the attacks.

On the same day, a grand council of over 1,000 Muslim clerics from across Afghanistan, which had convened to decide bin Laden's fate, issued a fatwa expressing sadness for the deaths in the 9/11 attacks, recommending that the Islamic Emirate \\"persuade\\" bin Laden to leave their country, and calling on the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to conduct an independent investigation of \\"recent events to clarify the reality and prevent harassment of innocent people\\".\\" The Taliban clerics' statement on Bin Laden\\", Guardian 20 September 2001 The fatwa went on to warn that should the United States not agree with its decision and invade Afghanistan, \\"jihad becomes an order for all Muslims.\\" However, on the same day the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan said: \\"We will neither surrender Osama bin Laden nor ask him to leave Afghanistan.\\" These maneuvers were dismissed by the US as insufficient.Tyler Marshall, \\"Afghan Clerics Urge Bin Laden to Go ‚Äì AFTER THE ATTACK Policy: Religious council's edict is applauded in the region.

It authorized the use of US Armed Forces against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks and those who harbored them. Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, to which all Coalition countries are signatories and for which its ratification by the US makes it the \\"law of the land\\", prohibits the 'threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state' except in circumstances where a competent organ of the UN (e.g. the Security Council) has authorized it, or where it is in self-defense under article 51 of the Charter. Although the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) did not authorize the US-led military campaign, some argued it was a legitimate form of self- defense under the UN Charter. Some proponents of the legality of the invasion argued that UNSC authorization was not required, since the invasion was an act of collective self-defense provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Specifically, it was argued that a series of UN Security Council Resolutions concerning Afghanistan provided for the possibility of establishing that the Taliban were indirectly responsibility for al-Qaeda's attacks, on the basis that Afghanistan was offering them safe harbour. Some critics claimed that the invasion was illegal under Article 51 because the 9/11 attacks were not \\"armed attacks\\" by another state, as required under article 51 of the Charter: they were not perpetrated by Afghanistan but by non-state actors. They argued that the actions taken by the terrorists in 9/11 were not attributable to Afghanistan. This position is consistent with the case law of the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, which has been slow to recognize attacks carried out by non-State actors as attributable to States, even in cases where States lend their support to the actions of non- State actors.Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). Merits, Judgment. I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 14. https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case- related/70/070-19860627-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf Others claimed that, even if the 9/11 attacks were attributable to Afghanistan, the response of the NATO coalition would not constitute self-defense as these acts do not meet the proportionality test under international law, as established in the Caroline Affair. On December 20, 2001, more than two months after the attack began, the UNSC authorized the creation of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to assist the Afghan Interim Authority in maintaining security. This resolution did not make any express declarations as to the legality of the war but determined that \\"the situation in Afghanistan still constituted a threat to international peace and security\\" while \\"reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan\\". 2001: Overthrow of the Taliban =Command Structure= US Army Special Forces and US Air Force Combat Controllers with Northern Alliance troops on horseback Under the overall leadership of General Tommy Franks, Commander-in-Chief, US Central Command, four major task forces were raised to support Operation Enduring Freedom: the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF), Combined Joint Task Force Mountain(CJTF-Mountain), the Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism (JIATF-CT), and the Coalition Joint Civil-Military Operations Task Force (CJCMOTF).Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.25 CJSOTF was a mixture of black and white SOF and comprised three subordinate task forces: Joint Special Operations Task Force-North (JSOTF-North - known as Task Force Dagger), Joint Special Operations Task Force-South (JSOTF-South - known as Task Force K-Bar) and Task Force Sword (later renamed Task Force 11). Task Force Dagger was established on October 10, 2001, led by Colonel James Mulholland and was formed around his 5th Special Forces Group with helicopter support from the 160th SOAR, Dagger was assigned to the north of Afghanistan. Task Force K-Bar, also established on October 10, was assigned to Southern Afghanistan, led by Navy SEAL Captain Robert Harward and formed around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group. The Task force principally conducted SR and SSE missions, although some 3rd SFG ODAs were given to the foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare role - advising anti- Taliban militias.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.27 Task Force Sword, established in early October 2001, was a black SOF unit under direct command of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). This was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was capturing or killing senior leadership and High-value target (HVT) within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Sword was initially structure around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force teams (Task Force Red) and ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). The British Special Boat Service was integrated directly into Swords structure.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.29 Alongside the SOF task forces operated the largely conventional CJTF-Mountain. Mountain initially comprised three subordinate commands, but only one was a special operations force - Task Force 64, a special forces task group built around a sabre squadron from the Australian SAS. The US Marines contributed Task Force 58, consisting of the 15th MEU, who were later replaced by Task Force Rakkasan. The JIATF-CT (better known as Task Force Bowie), led by Brigadier General Gary Harrell, was an intelligence integration and fusion activity manned by personnel from all Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Afghanistan (OEF-A) participating units, both US, coalition and a number of civilian intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Bowie numbered 36 military personnel and 57 from agencies such as FBI, NSA, and CIA, as well as liaison officers from coalition SOF. Administratively embedded within Bowie was Advanced Force Operations (AFO). AFO was a 45-man reconnaissance unit made up of Delta Force reconnaissance specialists augmented by selected SEALs from DEVGRU and supported by ISA's technical experts. AFO had been raised to support TF Sword and was tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to TF Sword. AFO conducted covert reconnaissance - sending small 2 or 3 man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or ATVs. The final task force supporting OEF-A was CJCMOTF, which had the responsibility of managing civil affairs and humanitarian efforts.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.30-31 =First move= On September 26, 2001, fifteen days after the 9/11 attack, the US covertly inserted (by a CIA-piloted Mi-17 helicopter) seven or eightNeville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.22 members of the CIA's Special Activities Division and Counter Terrorism Center (CTC), led by Gary Schroen, into the Panjshir Valley, north of Kabul. They formed the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team, known by the call-sign 'Jawbreaker', a team composed of former special operations, communication and linguistic experts.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.22-23Units Credited With Assault Landings They brought three cardboard boxes filled with $3 million in $100 bills to buy support. Jawbreaker linked up with General Mohammed Fahim, commander of the Northern Alliance forces in the Panjshir Valley, and prepared the way for the introduction of Army Special Forces into the region. The Jawbreaker team brought satellite communications enabling its intelligence reports to be instantly available to headquarters staff at Langley and Central Command (CENTCOM), who were responsible for Operation Crescent Wind and Operation Enduring Freedom. The Team also assessed potential targets for Operation Crescent Wind, provide an in-extremis CSAR and could provide BDA for the air campaign.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.22-24 On September 28, 2001, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw approved the deployment of MI6 officers to the Afghanistan and the region, utilising people involved with the mujahadeen in the 1980s, and who had language skills and regional expertise. At the end of the month, a handful of MI6 officers with a budget of $7 million landed in northeast Afghanistan, they met with General Mohammed Fahim of the Northern Alliance and began working with other contacts in the north and south to build alliances, to secure support and to bribe as many Taliban commanders as they could to change sides or leave the fight.Corera, Gordon, MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service, W&N; , 2012, , p.335 =Initial air strikes= USS Philippine Sea in a strike against al-Qaeda training camps and Taliban military installations in Afghanistan on 7 October 2001 On October 7, 2001, the US officially launched military operations in Afghanistan. Airstrikes were reported in Kabul, at the airport, at Kandahar (home of Mullah Omar), and in the city of Jalalabad. The day before the bombing commenced, Human Rights Watch issued a report urging that no military support be given to the Northern Alliance due to their human rights record. At 17:00 UTC, President Bush confirmed the strikes in his address to the nation, and Prime Minister Blair also addressed his nation. Bush stated that Taliban military sites and terrorist training grounds would be targeted. Food, medicine and supplies would be dropped to \\"the starving and suffering men, women and children of Afghanistan\\". Most of the Taliban's outdated SA-2 and SA-3 surface to air missiles, as well as its intended radar and command units, were destroyed on the first night along with the Taliban's small fleet of MIG-21s and Su-22s.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.24 Training camps and Taliban air defenses were bombarded by US aircraft, including Apache helicopter gunships from the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade. US Navy cruisers, destroyers and Royal Navy submarines launched several Tomahawk cruise missiles. The strikes initially focused on Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar. Within a few days, most Taliban training sites were severely damaged and air defenses were destroyed. The campaign focused on command, control, and communications targets. The front facing the Northern Alliance held, and no battlefield successes were achieved there. During these initial airstrikes a garrison of the 055 brigade near Mazar-i-Sharif was one of the first targets for US aircraft. Donald Rumsfeld described the troops as \\"the al-Qaeda-dominated ground force\\". Earlier Bin Laden had released a video in which he condemned all attacks in Afghanistan. On October 18, 2001, Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) teams 555 and 595, both 12-man Green Beret teams from the 5th Special Forces Group, plus Air Force Combat Controllers, were airlifted by helicopter from the Karshi- Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan more than across the Hindu Kush mountains in zero-visibility conditions by two MH-47E Chinook helicopters from 2nd Battalion 160th SOAR to the Dari-a-Souf Valley, just south of Mazar-e- Sharif.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.31, p.33 The Chinooks were refueled in-flight three times during the 11-hour mission, establishing a new world record for combat rotor-craft missions at the time. They linked up with the CIA and Northern Alliance. Within a few weeks the Northern Alliance, with assistance from the US ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban.Berntsen and Pezzulla (2005), Jawbreaker In mid-October 2001, A and G squadron of the British 22nd SAS Regiment, reinforced by members of the Territorial SAS regiments, deployed to north west Afghanistan in support of OEF-A. They conducted largely uneventful reconnaissance tasks under the code- name Operation Determine, none of these tasks resulted in enemy contact; they traveled in Land Rover Desert Patrol Vehicles (known as Pinkies) and modified ATVs. After a fortnight, with missions drying up, both squadrons returned to their barracks in the UK.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.69 =Objective Rhino and Gecko= On the night of October 19, 2001, 200 Rangers from the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, parachuted from 4 Lockheed MC-130 aircraft onto \\"Objective Rhino\\", a landing strip south of Kandahar, covered by AC-130 gunships. Before the Rangers dropped, the site was softened up by B-2 Spirit stealth bombers. The Rangers met almost no resistance, except for a solitary Taliban fighter who was quickly killed, securing the objective. A small Taliban force mounted in pick up trucks that attempted to investigate was spotted and destroyed by the AC-130s. The Rangers provided security while a FARP (Forward Arming and Refuelling Point) was established using fuel bladders from MC-130s; the mission paved the way for the later use of the airstrip by the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit as FOB Rhino, who would be among the first conventional forces to set foot in Afghanistan. No casualties were suffered in the operation itself (two Rangers received minor injuries in the jump itself), though two Rangers assigned to a CSAR element supporting the mission were killed when their MH-60L helicopter crashed at Objective Honda in Pakistan, a temporary staging site used by a company of Rangers from 3/75. The helicopter crashed due to a brownout.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.34-36 At the same time, a squadron of Delta Force operatives supported by Rangers from Task Force Sword conducted an operation outside of Kandahar at a location known as Objective Gecko ‚Äì its target was Mullah Omar, who was suspected to be at his summer retreat in the hills above Kandahar.Cawthorne, Nigel, The Mammoth Book of Inside the Elite Forces, Robinson, 2008 Four MH-47E helicopters took off from the USS Kitty Hawk (which was serving as an SOF base) in the Indian Ocean carrying 91 soldiers. The assault teams were drawn from Delta, while teams from the Rangers secured the perimeter and manned blocking positions. Before the soldiers were inserted, the target area was softened up by preparatory fire from AC-130s and MH-60L Direct Action Penetrators. The assaulters met no resistance on target and there was no sign of the Taliban leader, so they switched to exploiting the target location for any intelligence, while their helicopters landed at Rhino to refuel at the newly established FARP. As the teams prepared to extract, a sizable Taliban force approached the compound and engaged the US force with small arms fire and RPGs.Neville, Leigh Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan, London: Osprey, 2007 page 14. The Delta Force operators and Rangers engaged the insurgents and a heavy firefight developed. An attached Combat Controller directed fire from the orbiting AC-130s and DAPs, allowing the assault force to break contact and withdraw to an emergency Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ). One of the MH-47Es lost a wheel assembly after striking the compound wall in the scramble to extract the ground force. Some 30 Taliban fighters were killed in the firefight; there were no US soldiers killed, but 12 Delta operators were wounded. Delta's plans to leave a stay-behind reconnaissance team in the area were aborted by the Taliban response.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.36 =Continued air strikes= The Green Berets of ODA 595 split into two elements, Alpha and Bravo. Alpha rode on horseback with the Uzbek Warlord General Dostum to his headquarters to plan the impending assault on Mazar-e-Sharif. Bravo was tasked with clearing the Dari-a-Souf Valley of Taliban and to travel into the Alma Tak Mountains to get a good look at its area of operations.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.37 On October 20, 2001, the Alpha element of ODA 595 guided in the first JDAM bomb from a B-52, impressing Dostum, who soon taunted the Taliban over their radio frequencies. As part of its operations, the Americans beamed in radio broadcasts in both Pashto and Dari calling al-Qaeda and the Taliban criminals who were not proper Muslims and promising US$25 million to anyone who would provide information leading to the whereabouts of bin Laden.Neville, Leigh Special Forces Operations in Afghanistan, London: Osprey, 2007 page 15. Two weeks into the campaign, the Northern Alliance demanded the air campaign focus more on the front lines. A number of units from the US 5th Special Forces Group Operational Detachment Alpha teams were accompanied by USAF Tactical Air Control Party. They called in air strikes on targets, pounding Taliban vehicles, antiaircraft weapons, armored vehicles, their trenches, and ammunition supplies. On October 23, ODA 585 infiltrated an area near Kunduz to work alongside the warlord Burillah Khan.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.40 Examples of the US propaganda pamphlets dropped over Afghanistan The United States conducted its own psychological warfare operation with EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft beaming radio transmissions in both Dari and Pashtu to the Afghan civilian population. Radios were dropped with humanitarian packages that were fixed to only receive news and Afghan music from a Coalition radio station. Air Force Special Operations aircraft also dropped huge numbers of Psy Ops leaflets, decrying the Taliban and al-Qaeda as criminals who ruined Afghanistan and promoting the $25 million reward placed on Bin Laden's head.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.38 Carrier-based F/A-18 Hornet fighter-bombers hit Taliban vehicles in pinpoint strikes, while other aircraft cluster bombed Taliban defenses. At the beginning of November, US aircraft attacked front lines with daisy cutter bombs and AC-130 gunships. By November 2, Taliban frontal positions were devastated and a march on Kabul seemed possible. According to author Stephen Tanner, Also on November 2, the 10-man ODA 553 inserted into Bamain and linked up with General Kareem Kahlili's forces; ODA 534 was also inserted into the Dari-a-Balkh Valley after being delayed by weather for several nights, its role was to support General Mohammed Atta - the head of Jaamat-e-Islami militia. Alongside the Green Berets was a small element of CIA SAD operatives. Bravo team of ODA 595 conducted its own airstrikes in the Dari-a-Souf Valley, cutting off and destroying Taliban reinforcements and frustrating its attempts to relieve its embattled forces in the north. Cumulatively, the near constant airstrikes had begun to have a decisive effect and the Taliban began to withdraw toward Mazar-e-Sharif. Dostum's forces and Alpha team of ODA 595 followed, pausing only to drop further bombs on Taliban stragglers using their Special Operations Forces Laser Marker (SOFLAM), a device that emits laser-aiming point that can be followed by a smart bomb, such as a JDAM. On the Shomali Plains, ODA 555 and the CIA Jawbreaker team attached to Fahim Khan's forces began calling in airstrikes on entrenched Taliban positions at the southeastern end of the former Soviet air base at Bagram. The Green Berets set up an observation post in a disused air traffic control tower and with perfect lines of sight, guided in two BLU-82 Daisy Cutter bombs which devastated the Taliban lines, both physically and psychologically. By November 5, 2001, the advance of Dostum and his force was stalled at the Taliban-held village of Bai Beche in the strategically vital Dari-a-Souf Valley. Two earlier Northern Alliance attacks had been driven back by the entrenched Taliban; Dostum prepared his men to follow a bombing run from a B-52 with a cavalry charge, but one of Dostum's lieutenants misunderstood an order and sent around 250 Uzbek horseman charging toward the Taliban lines as the B-52 made its final approach, three or four bombs landed just in time on the Taliban positions and the cavalry charge succeeded in breaking the back of the Taliban defenders. On November 8, ODAs 586 and 594 were infiltrated into Afghanistan in MH-47s and picked up on the Afghan/Tajik border by CIA-flown MI-17s crewed by the SAD Air Branch contractors. ODA 586 deployed to Kunduz with the forces of General Daoud Khan and ODA 594 deployed into the Panjshir to assist the men of ODA 555.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.41 Bush went to New York City on November 10, 2001 to address the United Nations. He said that not only was the US in danger of further attacks, but so were all other countries in the world. Tanner observed, \\"His words had impact. Most of the world renewed its support for the American effort, including commitments of material help from Germany, France, Italy, Japan and other countries.\\" Al-Qaeda fighters took over security in Afghan cities. The Northern Alliance troops planned to seize Mazar-i-Sharif, cutting off Taliban supply lines and enabling equipment to arrive from the north and then attack Kabul. During the early months, the US military had a limited presence on the ground. Special Forces and intelligence officers with a military background liaised with Afghan militias and advanced after the Taliban was disrupted by air power. The Tora Bora Mountains lie roughly east of Kabul, on the Pakistan border. American analysts believed that the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had dug in behind fortified networks of caves and underground bunkers. The area was subjected to a heavy B-52 bombardment. US and Northern Alliance objectives began to diverge. While the US was continuing the search for Osama bin Laden, the Northern Alliance wanted to finish off the Taliban. =Battle of Mazar-i Sharif= US Army Special Forces on 10 November, upon arriving into the city with Northern Alliance fighters Mazari-i Sharif was important because it is the home of the Shrine of Ali or \\"Blue Mosque\\", a sacred Muslim site, and because it is a significant transportation hub with two major airports and a major supply route leading into Uzbekistan.New York Times, The Battle for Mazar-i-Sharif, 10 November 2001 Taking the city would enable humanitarian aid to alleviate a looming food crisis, which threatened more than six million people with starvation. Many of those in most urgent need lived in rural areas to the south and west of Mazar-i-Sharif.

The Northern Alliance foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah was \\"apoplectic\\" as he considered the uninvited arrival to be a violation of sovereignty, and complained bitterly to the head of the CIA field office, threatening to resign if the British did not withdraw. As it happened, the British government did alert the deputy head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan that they were deploying troops to Bagram, albeit at short notice. Arriving on the first flight, Brigadier Graeme Lamb, then the Director Special Forces, simply ignored Abdullah and drove to the Panjshir Valley, where he paid his respects to Ahmad Shah Massoud's grave and held talks with Northern Alliance leaders. The British Foreign Secretary tried to reassure the Northern Alliance that the deployment was not a vanguard of a British peacekeeping army, but Northern Alliance leaders did not believe them; with the threat of the Northern Alliance opening fire on incoming RAF troop transports, the deployment was put on hold.Farrell, Theo, Unwinnable: Britain‚Äôs War in Afghanistan, 2001‚Äì2014, Bodley Head, 2017 , P.81-82 On November 11, in the central north of Afghanistan, ODA 586 was advising General Daoud Khan outside the city of Taloqan and coordinating a batch of preparatory airstrikes when the General surprised everyone by launching an impromptu massed infantry assault on the Taliban holding the city. Before the first bomb could be dropped, the city fell. =Fall of Kabul= On the night of November 12, Taliban forces fled Kabul under cover of darkness. Northern Alliance forces (supported by ODA 555)Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.43 arrived the following afternoon, encountering a group of about twenty fighters hiding in the city's park. This group was killed in a 15-minute gun battle. After these forces were neutralized, Kabul was in the hands of coalition forces.Dobbins, James. \\"Our Man in Kabul\\" Foreign Affairs. 4 November 2009. The fall of Kabul started a cascading collapse of Taliban positions. Within 24 hours, all Afghan provinces along the Iranian border had fallen, including Herat. Local Pashtun commanders and warlords had taken over throughout northeastern Afghanistan, including Jalalabad. Taliban holdouts in the north fell back to the northern city of Kunduz. By November 16, the Taliban's last stronghold in northern Afghanistan was under siege. Nearly 10,000 Taliban fighters, led by foreign fighters, continued to resist. By then, the Taliban had been forced back to their heartland in southeastern Afghanistan around Kandahar.Poolos, Alexandra. \\"Afghanistan: Seizure of Kabul Catches World by Surprise\\" INS News. 13 November 2001 Elsewhere in Afghanistan UK and US special forces joined the Northern Alliance and other Afghan opposition groups to take Herat in November 2001. Canada and Australia also deployed forces. Other countries provided basing, access and overflight permission. As a result of all the losses, surviving members of the Taliban and al-Qaeda retreated toward Kandahar, the spiritual birthplace and home of the Taliban movement and Tora Bora. By November 13, al-Qaeda and Taliban forces, possibly including bin Laden, were concentrating in Tora Bora, southwest of Jalalabad. Nearly 2,000 al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters fortified themselves in positions within bunkers and caves. On November 16 the US began bombing the mountain redoubt. Around the same time, CIA and Special Forces operatives were at work in the area, enlisting local warlords and planning an attack.Tyrangiel, Josh. \\"Inside Tora Bora: The Final Hours?\\" Time, 16 December 2001 =Objective Wolverine, Raptor and Operation Relentless Strike= On November 13, the 75th Ranger Regiment carried out its second combat parachute drop into Afghanistan. A platoon-sized Ranger security element, including Team 3 of the Ranger Reconnaissance Detachment, accompanied by 8 Air Force Special Tactical operators, parachuted into a site southwest of Kandahar, codenamed Bastogne to secure a FARP for a follow on operation by the 160th SOAR. A pair of MC-130 cargo soon landed at the improvised airstrip and deposited four AH-6J Little Bird helicopters, the flight of little birds lifted off to hit a Taliban target compound near Kandahar code named Objective Wolverine. After destroying the target, the Little Birds returned to the FARP and proceeded to rearm and refuel and then they launched another strike against a second site called objective Raptor. With their mission completed, the Little Birds returned to the FARP, loaded onto the MC-130s and flew back to Pakistan. Several nights later, a similar mission codenamed Operation Relentless Strike took place ‚Äì this time with the Rangers driving their modified HMMWV and Land Rovers to secure a remote desert strip. These were the first missions in Afghanistan conducted by the Little Bird pilots of the 160th SOAR, as the helicopters could not operate at the high altitudes in the mountains. Meanwhile, the US was able to track and kill al-Qaeda's number three, Mohammed Atef, with a bomb at his Kabul home between November 14‚Äì16, 2001, along with his guard Abu Ali al-Yafi'i and six others.World News Connection, Al-Qa'ida member recalls US bombardment, accuses Taliban of betrayal , 29 October 2003Associated Press, \\"Taliban confirms death of Osama bin Laden's military chief in US strike\\", Houston Chronicle, 17 November 2001 =Battle of Tarinkot= US Army Special Forces with Hamid Karzai in Kandahar province On November 14, 2001, ODA 574 and Hamid Karzai inserted into Uruzgan Province via 4 MH-60K helicopters with a small force of guerrillas. In response to the approach of Karzai's force, the inhabitants of the town of Tarinkot revolted and expelled their Taliban administrators. Karzai traveled to Tarinkot to meet with the town elders. While he was there, the Taliban marshaled a force of 500 men to retake Tarinkot. Karzai's small force plus the American contingent, which consisted of US Army Special Forces from ODA 574 and their US Air Force Combat Controller, Tech Sergeant Alex Yoshimoto,http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/operation-enduring- freedom-the-first-49-days-5/ were deployed in front of the town to block their advance. Relying heavily on close air support directed by Yoshimoto, the American/Afghan force managed to halt the Taliban advance and drive them away from the town.The United States Army in Afghanistan - Operation ENDURING FREEDOM - October 2001-March 2003 The defeat of the Taliban at Tarinkot was an important victory for Karzai, who used the victory to recruit more men to his fledgling guerrilla band. His force would grow in size to a peak of around 800 men. On November 30, they left Tarinkot and began advancing on Kandahar. =Fall of Kunduz= Task Force Dagger attention focused on the last northern Taliban stronghold, Kunduz; as the bombardment at Tora Bora grew, the Siege of Kunduz was continuing. General Daoud and ODA 586 had initiated massive coalition airstrikes to demoralize the Taliban defenders. After 11 days of fighting and bombardment, Taliban fighters surrendered to Northern Alliance forces on November 23. Shortly before the surrender, Pakistani aircraft arrived to evacuate intelligence and military personnel who had been aiding the Taliban's fight against the Northern Alliance. The airlift is alleged to have evacuated up to five thousand people, including Taliban and al-Qaeda troops. =Operation Trent= After political intersession with Prime Minister Tony Blair, the SAS were given a direct-action task ‚Äì the destruction of an al-Qaeda-linked opium plant. The facility was located southwest of Kandahar, manned by between 80 and 100 foreign fighters, with defenses consisting of trench lines and several makeshift bunkers. The SAS were ordered to assault the facility in full daylight: the timelines had been mandated by CENTCOM and were based on the availability of air support assets ‚Äì only one hour of on- call close air support was provided. The timings meant that the squadrons could not carry out a detailed reconnaissance of the site prior to the assault being launched. Despite these factors, the commanding officer of 22 SAS accepted the mission. The Target was a low priority for the US and probably would have been destroyed from the air if the British hadn't argued for a larger role in Afghanistan; US SOF commanders guarded targets for their own units. The strategic significance of the facility has never fully been explained.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.70-71 The mission began in November 2001, with an 8-man patrol from G Squadron's Air Troop performing the regiments first wartime HALO parachute jump - onto a barren desert site in Registan to test its suitability as an improvised airstrip for the landing of the main assault force in C-130 Hecules. The Air Troop advance team confirmed it was suitable and later that day a fleet of C-130s began to land, each touching down just long enough for the SAS to disembark in their vehicles. Operators from A and G squadron drove directly off the ramps as the planes moved along the desert strip before the aircraft took off again; the squadrons were drove in 38 Land Rover \\"pinkies\\", 2 logistics vehicles and 8 Kawasaki dirt bikes, they formed up and proceeded towards their target. One Land Rover broke down due to an engine problem, the vehicle was left behind, its 3-man crew stayed to guard it (they were picked when the assault force exfilled). The assault force drove to a previously agreed forming-up point and split into two elements - the main assault force and the FSB (fire support base), A Squadron was given the task of assaulting the target facility, whilst G Squadron took the role of FSB, G Squadron would suppress the enemy with vehicle-mounted GPMGs, .50cal HMGs, MILAN antitank missiles along with 81mm mortars and M82A1 sniper rifle, allowing A squadron closed in on the target (the force was out of range of the Coalition artillery guns).Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.71 The Assault began with a preparatory airstrike, following this, A Squadron moved from its start line, firing its weapon; they pulled up meters from the outer perimeter to dismount from their vehicles and closed in on the target on foot. All the while, G Squadron provided covering fire with heavy weapons onto the facility. Air support flew sorties until they ran out of munitions; on a final pass, a US Navy F-18 Hornet strafed a bunker with its 20mm cannon, which narrowly missed several members of G Squadron.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.72 As A Squadron closed on the fortified positions several SAS troopers were wounded, the al-Qaeda fighters were not particularly well trained but they were fanatical fighters and most relished the fight. The SAS had to fight hard for every inch of progress. The RSM in command of the FSB joined in the action, he brought forward teams to reinforce A Squadron when he believed the assault was stalling, they were several hundred meters from the enemy positions when he was shot in the leg by an AK-47 round. Eventually, the A Squadron assault force reached the objective, they cleared the HQ building, gathering all intelligence materials they could find. The mission lasted 4 hours and a total of 4 SAS operators were wounded; the operation became the largest British SAS operation in history.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.69-72 =Battle of Qala-i-Jangi= On November 25, as Taliban and terrorist prisoners were moved into Qala-I-Janghi fortress near Mazar-I- Sharif, a few Taliban attacked their Northern Alliance guards. This incident triggered a revolt by 600 prisoners, who soon seized the southern half of the medieval fortress, including an armory stocked with an array of AK47s, RPGs and crew-served weapons. Johnny Micheal Spann, one of two CIA SAD operatives at the fortress who had been interrogating prisoners, was killed, marking America's first combat death.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 The other CIA operator, known as 'Dave,' managed to make contact with CENTCOM who relayed his request for assistance to SOF troops at TF Dagger safe house in Mazar-e-Sharif. The safe house housed members of Delta Force, some Green Berets and a small team from M squadron SBS. A QRF was immediately formed of whoever was in the safe house at the time: a headquarters element from 3rd Battalion, 5th SFG, a pair of USAF liaison officers, a handful of CIA SAD operators and the SBS team. The 8-man SBS team arrived in Land Rover 90s and the Green Berets and CIA operatives arrived in minivans and began engaging the prisoners, fighting a pitched battle to \\"stem the tide\\" of the uprising; as a result, CIA operative 'Dave' managed to escape, following this the operators turned their attention to recovering Spann's body. Over the course of 4 days the battle continued, Green Berets called in multiple airstrikes on the Taliban prisoners, during one CAS mission a JDAM was misdirected and hit the ground closed to the Coalition and Northern Alliance positions, wounding 5 Green Berets and four SBS operators to various degrees.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.72-74 AC-130 gunships kept up aerial bombardments throughout the night, the following day (November 27) the siege was finally broken as Northern Alliance T-55 tanks were brought into the central courtyard to fire shells from its main guns into several block houses containing Taliban. Fighting continued sporadically thought the week as the last remnants were mopped out by Dostrum's Northern Alliance forces, the combined Green Beret-SBS team recovered Spann's body.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.75 The revolt was crushed after seven days of fighting involving a Special Boat Service unit, Army Special Forces, and Northern Alliance forces and other aircraft provided strafing fire and launched bombs. 86 Taliban survived, and around 50 Northern Alliance soldiers were killed. The revolt was the final combat in northern Afghanistan. =Consolidation: the taking of Kandahar= ODA 574 and Hamid Karzai began moving on Kandahar, gathering fighters from friendly local Pashtun tribes. His militia force eventually numbered some 800 men. They fought for two days with the Taliban, who were dug into ridge-lines overlooking the strategic Sayd-Aum-Kalay Bridge, eventually seizing it, with the help of US air-power, and opening the road to Kandahar.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.44 By the end of November, Kandahar was the Taliban's last stronghold, and was coming under increasing pressure. Nearly 3,000 tribal fighters, led by Karzai and Gul Agha Sherzai, the governor of Kandahar before the Taliban seized power, pressured Taliban forces from the east and cut off northern supply lines to Kandahar. The Northern Alliance loomed in the north and northeast. ODA 583 had infiltrated the Shin-Narai Valley, southeast of Kandahar to support Gul Agha Sherzai, the former governor of Kandahar. By November 24, ODA 583 had established covert observations posts, which allowed them to call in devastating fire on Taliban positions.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.45 A US Marine with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit leads others to a security position after seizing a Taliban forward-operating base November 25, 2001 Meanwhile, nearly 1,000 US Marines, ferried in by CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters and C-130s, set up a Forward Operating Base known as Camp Rhino in the desert south of Kandahar on November 25. This was the coalition's first base, and enabled other operating bases to form. The first significant combat involving US ground forces occurred a day after Rhino was captured, when 15 Taliban armored vehicles approached the base and were attacked by helicopter gunships, destroying many of them. Meanwhile, airstrikes continued to pound Taliban positions inside the city, where Mullah Omar remained. Omar remained defiant although his movement controlled only four out of 30 Afghan provinces by the end of November. He called on his forces to fight to the death. On December 5, a 2,000 lb GPS-guided bomb landed among the Green Berets from ODA 574, killing 3 members and wounding the rest of the team. Over 20 of Karzai's militia were also killed and Karzai himself slightly wounded. A Delta Force unit nearby that had been operating nearby on a classified reconnaissance mission arrived in their Pinzgauers and secured the site, while Delta medics worked with wounded Green Berets. Along with a USMC CH-53 casualty evacuation helicopter onboard ODB 570 and ODA 524 were immediately dispatched by helicopter to assist with the wounded and to eventually replace the fallen operators of ODA 574. On December 6, Karzai was informed that he would be the next president of Afghanistan, he also negotiated the successful surrender of both the remaining Taliban forces around Sayd-Aum-Kalay and the entire city of Kandahar itself. ODA 524, ODB 570 and Karzai's militia began their final push to clear the city. The US government rejected amnesty for Omar or any Taliban leaders. On December 7, Sherzai's forces seized Kandahar airport and moved in the city of Kandahar. Omar slipped out of Kandahar with a group of loyalists and moved northwest into the mountains of Uruzgan Province, thus reneging on the Taliban's promise to surrender their fighters and their weapons. He was last reported seen leaving in a convoy of motorcycles. Other Taliban leaders fled to Pakistan through the remote passes of Paktia and Paktika Provinces. The border town of Spin Boldak surrendered on the same day, marking the end of Taliban control in Afghanistan. Afghan forces under Gul Agha seized Kandahar, while the US Marines took control of the airport and established a US base. Also in early December 2001, as the US invasion of Afghanistan was almost completed, it was reported that warlord Dostum's forces, who were fighting the Taliban alongside the US Special Forces, had intentionally suffocated as many as 3,000 Taliban prisoners in container trucks in an incident that has become known as the Dasht-i-Leili massacre. The Taliban prisoners were shot and/or suffocated while being transferred by US and Junbish-i Milli soldiers from Kunduz to Sheberghan prison in Afghanistan. The site of the graves is believed to be in the Dasht-i-Leili desert just west of Sheberghan, in the Jowzjan Province. =Battle of Tora Bora= Air strikes on Tora Bora After the fall of Kabul and Kandahar, al-Qaeda elements including Bin Laden and other key leaders withdrew to Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province, from there they moved into the Tora Bora region of the White Mountains, 20 km away from the Pakistan border - where there was a network of caves and prepared defenses used by the mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan War. Signal intercepts and interrogation of captured Taliban fighters and al-Qaeda terrorists pointed towards the presence of significant numbers of foreign fighters and possible HVTs in and moving to the area; instead of committing conventional forces, higher echelons of both the White House and the Pentagon took the decision to isolate and destroy the al- Qaeda elements in the area with the US SOF supporting locally recruited AMFs (Afghan Militia Forces) - due to misplaced fear of replicating the Soviets experience in the area.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.45-46 ODA 572 and a CIA Jawbreaker team (small group of CIA SAD ground branch operators) were dispatched to Tora Bora to advise eastern anti-Taliban forces under the command of two warlords: Hazrat Ali and Mohammed Zaman (both had a deep-seated distrust toward each other); using CIA hard currency, some 2,500 to 3,000 AMF were recruited for the coming battle; al-Qaeda were using Tora Bora as a final strongpoint. The leader of the CIA Jawbreaker team requested a battalion of Rangers - 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment - to be dropped into the mountains to establish blocking positions along potential escape routes out of Tora Bora into Pakistan. They would serve as the 'anvil' whilst Green Berets with the AMF would be the 'Hammer,' with attached Air Force Combat Controllers, the Rangers could direct airstrikes onto enemy concentrations or engage them in ambushes; troops from the 10th Mountain Division were also an option, but this was denied.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.46-47 From the outset of the battle, ODA 572 with its attached Combat Controller called in precision airstrikes (15,000lb Daisy Cutters were often used), whilst their AMFs launched what amounted to a number of poorly executed and coordinated attacks on established al-Qaeda positions with a predictable degree of success. The Green Berets discovered that the militias lacked both the motivation and skill for the battle: according to ODA members they would gain ground in the morning following US airstrikes and then relinquish control of those gains the same day, they would also retreat to their base areas for sleep each night. With the AMF offensive stalled and the CIA and ODA teams overstretched, the decision was made to deploy more troops into the battle.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.47 40 operators from A squadron Delta Force were forward deployed to Tora Bora and would assume tactical command of the battle from the CIA, with the Delta squadron were a dozen of so members of M squadron SBS, members of MI6 also deployed to the region alongside the SBS. The Delta operators were deployed in small teams embedded within the militias and sent their own Recce operators out to pick up Bin Laden's trail, eventually with the assistance of Green Berets and CIA operators cajoling the AMF, progress was made. The Delta squadron commander agreed with the Jawbreaker assessment of the situation and requested blocking forces or the scattering of aerial landmines to deny mountain passes to the enemy and since the deployment of the Ranger battalion had been denied, he requested that his operators carryout their proposed role but all his requests were denied by General Franks. On December 12, two weeks into the battle, AMF commander Zaman opened negotiations with the trapped al- Qaeda and Taliban in Tora Bora, despite the frustrations of the Americans and British, a temporary truce was called until 0800hr the following morning to allow al-Qaeda to supposedly agree to surrender terms by Shura (group meeting). This was a ruse played to allow as many as several hundred al-Qaeda and members of the 055 Brigade to escape over night toward Pakistan.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.48-49 69-70Corera, Gordon, MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service, W&N; , 2012, , p.338 The following day, a handheld ICOM radio recovered from the body of a dead al-Qaeda fighter allowed members of the Delta squadron, SBS, CIA, and MI6 to hear Bin laden's voice - apparently apologizing to his followers for leading them to Tora Bora and giving his blessing for their surrender - thought to be addressed to the terrorists that stayed to fight a rearguard action to allow Bin Laden to escape. Credible rumors of cash payments by Bin Laden to at least one of the warlords abound - the reluctance of the AMF to press the attack may have been influenced by similar bribes. The leader of the CIA Jawbreaker team at Tora Bora believed that two large al-Qaeda groups escaped: the smaller group of 130 jihadis escaped east into Pakistan, while the second group including Bin Laden and 200 Saudi and Yemeni jihadis took the route across the mountains to the town of Parachinar, Pakistan; the Delta squadron commander believed that Bin Laden crossed the border into Pakistan sometime around 16 December. A Delta Recce team, call-sign 'Jackal', spotted a tall man wearing a camouflage jacket with a large number of fighters entering a cave, the Recce team called in multiple airstrikes on the obvious presumption that it was Bin Laden, but later DNA analysis from the remains did not match Bin Laden's. With the majority of the terrorists gone the battle came to an end, official tallies of claiming hundreds of al-Qaeda killed at Tora Bora are difficult to confirm since many of the bodies were buried in caves or vaporized by bombs, just under 60 prisoners were taken.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.48-49Corera, Gordon, MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service, W&N; , 2012, , p.338p.20 Around December 17, across the border, Pakistani Border Scouts, allegedly assisted by members of JSOC and the CIA in capturing an upward of another 300 foreign fighters. On December 20, ODA 561 were inserted into the White Mountains to support ODA 572 in conducting SSE of the caves and to assist with recovering DNA samples from terrorist bodies.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.49 US and UK forces continued searching into January, but no sign of al-Qaeda leadership emerged. An estimated 200 al-Qaeda fighters were killed during the battle, along with an unknown number of tribal fighters. No American or British deaths were reported. =Diplomatic and humanitarian efforts= In December 2001 the United Nations hosted the Bonn Conference. The Taliban were excluded. Four Afghan opposition groups participated. Observers included representatives of neighboring and other involved major countries. The resulting Bonn Agreement created the Afghan Interim Authority that would serve as the \\"repository of Afghan sovereignty\\" and outlined the so-called Petersberg Process that would lead towards a new constitution and a new Afghan government. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1378 of November 14, 2001, included \\"Condemning the Taliban for allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism by the al-Qaeda network and other terrorist groups and for providing safe haven to Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda and others associated with them, and in this context supporting the efforts of the Afghan people to replace the Taliban regime\\". The United Nations World Food Programme temporarily suspended activities within Afghanistan at the beginning of the bombing attacks but resumed them after the fall of the Taliban. =Security force for Kabul= ISAF insignia On December 20, 2001, the United Nations authorized an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), with a mandate to help the Afghans maintain security in Kabul and surrounding areas. It was initially established from the headquarters of the British 3rd Mechanised Division under Major General John McColl, and for its first years numbered no more that 5,000.ISAF in Afghanistan CDI, Terrorism Project ‚Äì 14 February 2002. The force had the invitation of the new interim Afghan government;Farrell, Theo, Unwinnable: Britain‚Äôs War in Afghanistan, 2001‚Äì2014, Bodley Head, 2017 , P.82 Its mandate did not extend beyond the Kabul area for the first few years. Eighteen countries were contributing to the force in February 2002. 2002: Operation Anaconda In January 2002, another series of caves was discovered in Zawar Kili, just south of Tora Bora, airstrikes hit the sites before SOF teams were inserted into the area. A SEAL platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German KSK element, a Norwegian SOF team and JTF2 reconnaissance teams spent some nine days conducting extensive searches/site exploitation, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they didn't encounter any al-Qaeda fighters.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.49-50, p.77 Following the Loya jirga, tribal leaders and former exiles established an interim government in Kabul under Hamid Karzai. US forces established their main base at Bagram airbase just north of Kabul. Kandahar airport also became an important US base. Outposts were established in eastern provinces to hunt for Taliban and al- Qaeda fugitives. Canadian soldiers from 3PPCLI move into the hills to search for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters after an air assault onto an objective north of Qualat, Afghanistan. An anti-Taliban fighter wraps a bandolier of ammunition for his 7.62 mm PK machine gun around his body while he helps to secure a compound in Helmand Province in Afghanistan, January 2002. Al-Qaeda forces regrouped in the Shah-i-Kot Valley area, Paktia province, in January and February 2002. A Taliban fugitive in Paktia province, Mullah Saifur Rehman began reconstituting some of his militia forces. They totaled over 1,000 by the beginning of March 2002. The insurgents wanted to launch guerrilla attacks and possibly a major offensive, copying 1980s anti-Soviet fighters. The US detected the buildup, and on March 2, 2002, US, Canadian, and Afghan forces began \\"Operation Anaconda\\" against them. The trucks of Task Force Hammer become stuck in the mud while owing to a communications mistake, the massive aerial bombardment did not take place.Neville, Peter Special Forces Operations in Afghanistan, London: Osprey, 2007 page 21. The poorly trained Afghan government troops proved incapable of fighting al-Qaeda without air support. Mujahideen forces, using small arms, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars, were entrenched into caves and bunkers in the hillsides largely above . They used \\"hit and run\\" tactics, opening fire and then retreating to their caves and bunkers to weather the return fire and bombing. US commanders initially estimated their opponents as an isolated pocket numbering fewer than 200. Instead the guerrillas numbered between 1,000‚Äì5,000, according to some estimates. By March 6, eight American, seven Afghan allied, and up to 400 Al Qaida opposing fighters had been killed. At one point, while coming under heavy al-Qaeda force, the Afghan government forces fled in panic and refused to fight, leading to the men of Task Force Hammer to take on al-Qaeda alone.Neville, Peter Special Forces Operations in Afghanistan, London: Osprey, 2007 page 22. \\"Friendly fire\\" incidents where American troops were bombed by their air force several times added to further difficulties. Sub-engagements included the Battle of Takur Ghar on 'Roberts Ridge,' and follow-up Operations Glock and Polar Harpoon.Donald P. Wright & al., A Different Kind of War : The United States Army in Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) October 2001-September 2005, Fort Leavenworth, Kan. : Combat Studies Institute Press, 2009 http://documents.nytimes.com/a-different-kind-of-war#p=1 p.171, 173, 177 Several hundred guerrillas escaped to the tribal areas in Waziristan. During Operation Anaconda and other missions during 2002 and 2003, the New Zealand Special Air Service and other special forces from Australia, Germany, and Norway were also involved in operations. In February 2002, the National Security Council met to decide whether to expand ISAF beyond Kabul. In a dispute between Powell and Rumsfeld (a pattern repeated often through the Bush Administration) Rumsfeld's view that the force should not be expanded prevailed.Seth Jones, 'In the Graveyard of Empires,' Norton & Company, 2009, 114-115. See also Maley in Maley & Schmeidl, 'Reconstructing Afghanistan,' 2015, 104, and reference in B. Greener, 'The New International Policing' Historians later wrote that the failure of ISAF to be deployed beyond Kabul drove Karzai to offer positions within the state to potential spoilers whose activities did great harm to the state's reputation.Maley in Hynek and Martin, 'Statebuilding in Afghanistan,' 2012, 130. Because the rise of the insurgency was linked to grievances over governance,Seth G. Jones, The Rise of Afghanistan's Insurgency, International Security, 2008. this became a serious problem. US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's aimed to carry out operations in Afghanistan as quickly as possible, and leave as fast as possible. He thus wished to focus on kinetic counter-terrorism operations and building up a new Afghan Army. Operation Harpoon started in the early hours of March 13, aiming to eliminate pockets of Taliban and Al-Qaeda resistance in the Arma Mountains in eastern Afghanistan. The land component was under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Pat Stogran, the commanding officer of 3rd Battalion, the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (3 PPCLI). It consisted of a battalion-sized Canadian and an American force from the 187th Infantry Regiment, of the 101st Airborne Division. =Post-Anaconda operations= Following the battle at Shahi-Kot, al-Qaeda fighters established sanctuaries on the Pakistani border, where they launched cross-border raids beginning in the summer of 2002. Guerrilla units, numbering between 5 and 25 men, regularly crossed the border to fire rockets at coalition bases, ambush convoys and patrols and assault non-governmental organizations. The area around the Shkin base in Paktika province saw some of the heaviest activity. Taliban fighters remained in hiding in the rural regions of four southern provinces: Kandahar, Zabul, Helmand and Uruzgan. After Anaconda the Department of Defense requested British Royal Marines, highly trained in mountain warfare, to be deployed. In response, 45 Commando deployed under the operational code-name Operation Jacana in April 2002. They conducted missions (including Operation Snipe, Operation Condor, and Operation Buzzard) over several weeks with varying results. The Taliban avoided combat. In May 2002 Combined Joint Task Force 180 became the senior US military headquarters in the country, under Lieutenant General Dan K. McNeill. Later in 2002, CJSOFT became a single integrated command under the broader CJTF-180 that commanded all US forces assigned to OEF-A, it was built around an Army Special Forces Group (often manned by National Guard units) and SEAL teams. A small JSOC element (formerly Task Force Sword/11) not under direct CTJF command - embedded within CJSOFT, it was manned by a joint SEAL and Ranger element that rotated command, it was not under direct ISAF command, although it operated in support of NATO operations.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.83 Aftermath Several events, taken together, in early 2002 can be seen as the ending of the first phase of the US led war in the country. The first was the dispersal of the major groups of the Taliban and Al Qaeda after the end of Anaconda. In the United States, in February 2002 the decision was taken not to expand international security forces beyond Kabul. Finally President Bush made his speech at the Virginia Military Institute on April 17, 2002, invoking the memory of General George Marshall whilst talking of Afghan reconstruction, which resulted in discussion of a ‚ÄòMarshall Plan‚Äô for Afghanistan.Jones, Graveyard of Empires, 116-117. The decision against a significant expansion of international presence and development assistance was later seen by historians as a major error.Jones, Graveyard of Empires, 132-33. Avoiding large forces which might rouse the Afghans against the United States was later seen as a fallacy. However, the growing commitment to Iraq was absorbing more and more resources, which in hindsight would have made committing such resources to Afghanistan impossible.Jones, Graveyard of Empires, 124-129.

He currently works as the Brisbane Lions women's team coach and AFL Queensland Female Football High Performance Manager. He was recruited from East Perth whom he played 37 games for after he won the 1986 F. D. Book Medal for being judged their best and fairest player. On the back of this, he was recruited to Collingwood in the VFL. Starcevich made his VFL debut in 1987 with the Collingwood Football Club. The key position player came off the bench in Collingwood's 1990 premiership side and was a solid contributor during the 1990 AFL Grand Final. He played 124 games, kicking 162 goals for Collingwood before moving to the Brisbane Bears in 1994. He went on to play 20 games for 16 goals for the Bears before retiring at the end of 1995. Following his retirement from AFL football, Starcevich has become one of the most prominent fitness trainers in the AFL, providing his services to the Brisbane Lions and being part of premiership success with his conditioning work. In 2006 he was recruited as part of the St Kilda Football Club's head of training services in an attempt to turn around the club's large injury list in the 2005 season. During the 2006 pre-season Starcevich adopted a controversial policy whereby players were banned from wearing thongs, citing the fact that they could increase the risk of injuries to feet. He left the Saints before the 2007 season citing \\"family reasons\\". In March 2007, Starcevich joined A-league team Queensland Roar as strength and conditioning coach. In June 2016, Starcevich was appointed head coach of the Brisbane Lions women's team.Michael Whiting, \\"Coup for Lions as inaugural women's coach named\\" , AFL.com.au, 22 June 2016. Retrieved 10 September 2016. Starcevich guided the Lions to the minor premiership in the inaugural season of AFL Women's in 2017. By finishing first, the Lions qualified for the 2017 AFL Women's Grand Final. The team lost to the Adelaide Crows in the decider. In the league's second season, the Lions once again lost the Grand Final by six points under Starcevich, in a game which ended 27‚Äì21 in favour of the Western Bulldogs.

From 1887, he worked in Paris in the press bureau of the French foreign office and was active in the campaign on behalf of Alfred Dreyfus. In 1893 he founded a short-lived biweekly called La Vraie Parole as a foil to the anti-Jewish La Libre Parole.Schwartz 1991, p. 20.: \\"It folded in less than a year, however, partly because of the mood and priorities of the French Jewish community at that time, a majority of whom did not support a direct, vocal response to antisemitism. Yet, part of the failure can be attributed to Singer himself: the historian Michael Marrus has called him a 'latter-day Amos'; he castigated the wealthy Jews of France for their lack of support for Jewish causes in general and his journal in particular. Such personal attacks coupled with Singer's general assaults on the French social system, coming as they did from a foreigner, served to alienate him from the very Jews he wished to represent. It is not surprising that he left for New York the following year.\\" = New York = Singer moved to New York City in 1895 where he learned English and taught French, raising the money for the Jewish Encyclopedia he had envisioned.Schwartz 1991, p. 20. Over the course of his career, Singer also proposed many projects which never won backing, including a multi-million- dollar loan to aid the Jews of Eastern Europe, a Jewish university open to students of any background, various encyclopedias about secular topics, and a 25-volume publication series of Hebrew classics. By 1911, the date of this latter proposal, \\"neither the [Jewish] Publication Society nor any body of respectable scholars would work with him,\\" according to encyclopedist Cyrus Adler.Schwartz 1991, pp. 21‚Äì22.  Religious views  Singer held extremely liberal views which at times proved unpopular. He endorsed Jesus and the Christian New Testament and proposed a Hebrew translation. He founded the Amos Society to promote understanding among followers of monotheistic religions. His 1897 prospectus for the encyclopedia project called for harmony between religions; called the Sabbath and holidays \\"heavy burdens, or, at best, mere ceremonies\\" for most Jews; and made the radical suggestion that Jewish parents, if honest with their children, would tell them: Due to the controversy of Singer's outlooks, his publisher, Funk & Wagnalls, agreed to the encyclopedia project only after divesting Singer of editorial control and appointing a board of prestigious Jewish scholars, including rabbis.

He is especially known for his drawings for the Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe collection of Norske Folkeeventyr, and his illustrations for the Norwegian edition of the Snorri Sturlason Heimskringla.Erik Werenskiold(Store norske leksikon) Background Erik Theodor Werenskiold was born in Eidskog, at Granli gaard, southeast of Kongsvinger in Hedmark county, Norway. He lived his first four years there with his family, until they moved to Kongsvinger. Werenskiold grew up in Kongsvinger Fortress as the fourth son of the commander. He attended the Kongsvinger national school and then in the three years 1869-72 was at the privately owned Latin school operated by Harald Aars and Peter Voss (Aars og Voss' skole) in Christiania. Based on advice from the painter Adolph Tidemand, he attended a college for painters. During 1873, he was a pupil of Norwegian sculptor, Julius Middelthun (1820‚Äì1886), at the Drawing School in Christiania (Tegneskolen i Kristiania). He studied for a short time at the studio of artist, Axel Ender in the autumn of 1875.Julius Middelthun (Store norske leksikon)Axel Ender (Store norske leksikon) Career On the Plain (1883) He went to Munich where he stayed for four years. His meeting with the French air painting, particularly Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, at a French art show in Munich in 1879, convinced Werenskiold of its superiority over the German studio painting. In the spring of 1880, Werenskiold was paralyzed in the right arm. After half a year of hospitalization and recreation in Switzerland at Oberbayern and Tyrol, he finally regained his health. From 1881-83 he lived in Paris. In 1883, Werenskiold returned to Norway where he spent the summers in Telemark. He returned to France in 1884‚Äì1885 and studied with L√©on Bonnat (1888‚Äì89). In the spring of 1895 he made a study trip to Rome and Florence. He made several paintings of peasants in landscapes. Illustrations for Norwegian fairy tales had interested him since his time in Munich, and he now got the opportunity to illustrate Norwegian fairy tales together with Theodor Kittelsen. He illustrated Norwegian folktales (Norske Folkeeventyr) in 1879 and continued with Adventure Tales for Children (Eventyrbog for B√∏rn. Norske Folkeeventyr) by Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe in three volumes during the period 1882‚Äì1887. Werenskiold illustrated a new edition of King's Sagas (kongesagae) from Snorre Sturlason and The Family at Gilje (Familjen paa Gilje) (1903) by Jonas Lie.Erik Werenskiold/utdypning (Store norske leksikon) His wide range of characterized portraits make up an entire pantheon of famous Norwegians from his lifetime. Werenskiold received the Norwegian national artist's salary from 1908. He was appointed Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1890, Commander 1905, Commander of the 1st class of 1930 and the Grand Cross 1935. He was also Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog. He died at B√¶rum, in Akershus county, Norway. He was buried at V√•r Frelsers gravlund in Oslo. Personal life He was married to the painter Sophie Marie Stoltenberg Thomesen (1849‚Äì1926).

The eldest of four children, Farmer was recognised as child prodigy, playing violin, piano and harp. His uncle Henry Farmer (1819‚Äì1891) was also a conductor, composer, violinist and organist in Nottingham. He owned a successful music- warehouse and nurtured his nephew's musical talent. Between 1849 and 1852, Farmer studied piano at the Leipzig Conservatory with Ignaz Moscheles , after which he studied for a year in Coburg under Andreas Spaeth, a composer, organist and clarinetist.Grove Music Online entry, accessed 3 May 2014 Farmer returned to England to briefly work in his parents' millinery business, then travelled to Switzerland in 1853, marrying Mary Elizabeth Stahel (1840‚Äì1914) in 1859, the daughter of a Zurich schoolteacher, with whom he eventually had 7 children. His daughter Mary was married to the Scottish classicist John Burnet. Farmer suffered a stroke at Oxford in 1900 and died in July, 1901. He was buried at St Sepulchre's Cemetery, Oxford. Teacher at Harrow School, 1862-1885. After teaching in Zurich for some years, John became music master and violin teacher at Harrow in 1862, reportedly appointed as a result of being noticed while giving piano demonstrations at the London International Exhibition. During his time at Harrow, he introduced 'house-singing' (still part of a new boy's 'initiation' into the school community) and composed many school songs and other larger vocal works for the education and enjoyment of students and staff. He encouraged the participation of the boys in massed singing for school events and the serious study of instrumental music. This was during a period when the inclusion of music within public school education in England was in its infancy and its acceptance was often resisted by school boards and principals. Affectionately known as \\"Sweaty John\\",Ivimey, in Rainbow (1990) pg 277 Farmer also introduced the smoking concert, or \\"Tobacco Parliament\\", that was held on Founder's Day, where school songs and musical contributions were welcomed from staff, boys and friends, with Farmer's items particularly memorable - he was remembered as a \\"capital entertainer\\" according to John Ivimey.Rainbow (1990), p. 284. His songs continue to be published in modern editions of the \\"Harrow School Songs\\" book. The school song, ‚ÄúForty Years On‚Äù, was written in 1872 with fellow teacher Edward Ernest Bowen as lyricist. He also composed cricketing ditties like \\"Willow the King,\\" one of the most famous of all cricketing songs. His opera, \\"Cinderella\\" was performed at Harrow in 1883. His pupils included Elsie Hall and Mary Louisa White. Organist at Balliol College, Oxford Farmer left Harrow in 1885 to take up the post of Organist at Balliol College, Oxford. During his tenure, he founded the Balliol College Musical Society. His proposed Sunday evening concerts in the College Hall were initially controversial when the performances on the Sabbath were strongly disapproved of by strict Sabbatarians. However, the Sunday evening concerts are still presented by the College Music Society today. While at Balliol he composed Warwick School's first school song, Here's a Song For All, in 1892. He championed the music of Bach, editing two volumes for school students, and his own oratorio \\"Christ and His Soldiers\\" was popular with smaller choirs.

He was preceded by King Jijeung (r. 500‚Äì514) and succeeded by King Jinheung. By the time of his reign, Buddhism had become fairly common in Silla, as it had been introduced much earlier by Goguryeo monks during King Nulji's reign. One of King Beopheung's ministers, a man named Ichadon, was a Buddhist convert who had even shaved his head and took the tonsure. He constantly implored the king to adopt Buddhism as the state religion, and in fact King Beopheung himself had become fond of Buddha's teachings. However, the other ministers of Silla were greatly opposed to this, and expressed such defiance to the king. Beopheung, having been persuaded by his ministers, was at a crossroads, and encountered great reluctance to change. At this time, Ichadon suggested his own martyrdom and pleaded with the king to execute him in public for the cause of Buddhism. This the king refused to do, and so Ichadon deliberately insulted the ministers of the kingdom, thus provoking the anger of the king. In the end, Ichadon was executed in public, but before his head was cut off, he stated that the blood spilled from his body would not be red but milky white. According to the Samguk Yusa, his predictions proved correct, and Ichadon's milky blood horrified the ministers of the kingdom. As a result of Ichadon's martyrdom, King Beopheung finally chose Buddhism as the state religion. However, true Buddhist freedom in Silla would not begin until the reign of King Jinheung.

Sir Kenneth and Sir James Douglas rode out on Crusade with Sir Simon Locard of Lee, Sir William Keith of Galston, Sir William de St. Clair and his younger brother John of Rosslyn, Sir Symon Glendonwyn, Sir Alan Cathcart and the brothers Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig and Sir Walter Logan.Sir Herbert Maxwell, History of the House of Douglas II Vols., London 1902 Locard would as a result of this Crusade became known as Lockhart. There was also a young William Borthwick. Having been granted a promise of safe conduct from Edward III of England, the party sailed from North Berwick and made for Luys in Flanders in the spring of 1330 remaining there for 12 days and attracting more followers from all over Europe. The Knights Templar had been outlawed and ordered killed by this time. There are no written records of who joined the party of Scottish knights. There is circumstantial evidence that at least one knight from Germany joined in Flanders.Matthew Battles, 2008, Papal signifiers, How to read the coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI, http://cache.boston.com/bonzai- fba/Original_PDF/2008/04/12/1208010928_4005.pdf Their intention was to then sail to Cape Finisterre in the north west of Spain to visit Santiago de Compostela which had been ordained as a holy town by Pope Alexander III following the discovery of the remains of the Apostle James. A pilgrimage to Santiago captured the imagination of Christian Europe on an unprecedented scale as it was the third holiest site in Christendom and, at the height of its popularity in the 11th and 12th century, attracted over half a million pilgrims each year. However, before they could set off for Santiago word reached them that the King of Castile and Le√≥n, Alphonso XI, in his efforts to drive the Nasrid dynasty (Moors) out of Granada had laid siege to the Castillo de las Estrellas (Castle of the Stars) at Teba which was occupied by the Saracen army of Muhammed IV, Sultan of Granada. The knights travelled to Seville and offered their support to Alfonso for his Crusade to rid the Iberian Peninsula of non-Christians. They marched the short distance to Teba.BRAVHEART The Battle of Teba, http://www.spain-info.co.uk/History/Battle- of-Teba/Braveheart-Sir-James-Douglas.htm, January, 2012 On 25 August 1330, south east of Seville in a saddle high above the river the knights came to Teba in al-Andalus. There, three thousand of Muhammed IV's cavalry made a feigned attack on the Christians. The great body of his army took a circuitous route to fall, unexpectedly, upon the rear of Alfonso's camp. With the Christian troops otherwise engaged, the Templar Knights faced overwhelming odds. Templar Knights did not retreat and Sir James gave the order to charge. Sir James Douglas, Sir William St. Clair, Sir John de St. Clair, Sir Robert Logan and Sir Walter Logan died in battle. To be a Templar Knight requires giving up family name in devotion to Christ. These Scottish knights followed the practice of Sir Kenneth. Instead, of going into battle with the family coat of arms, the knights, like Sir Kenneth were marked by crosses and stars. After the battle families would buy back the captured knights. Unfortunately for the fallen knights, the Moors would have preferred to gain wealth by returning captured knights. Lochard did take a Moorish knight captive and was given a jewel that would become known as the Lockhardt penny for the knights release back to his family. In Teba's Plaza de Espana stands a block of Scottish granite to commemorate this town's illustrious connection with Robert the Bruce where the Scottish knights gave their lives to recover the plain below the castle for Christian Spain.Garvey, Geoff and Mark Ellingham, The Rough Guide to Andalucia 6, Rough Guides; 6 edition (20 April 2009) Sir Kenneth survived to oversee preparations for transport home of the fallen Templar Knights. This included the scrubbing clean of bones. He returned the Scottish knights to their family homes. For his extraordinary bravery and for might when faced with overwhelming odds, Sir Kenneth's surname was forever changed from de la More to Moir, from the Scottish Gaelic for brave and mighty one. The earliest Moir armorial bearing, the family crest of the Moirs, depicts a shield beset with laurels under a knight's helmet. Larger than the helmet above is a skull scrubbed clean with two leg bones saltire proper in a cross to represent the fallen knight. The two bones form the cross of Saint Andrew's, a saint martyred on a tipped cross, \\"a mort head upon two leg bones saltyre ways proper.\\"Amorial Bearings from the \\"Lyon Register\\" quoted in Alexander L. Moir,1913, Moir Genealogy and Collateral Lines, Lowell, MA Below the knight's helmet are three Moor heads in their gore cut proper with blood dripping arranged in a perfect triangle. To draw away attention from the triangular symmetry and to the answer the question why three over the centuries arose the saying: \\"One Christian Moir slew three pagan Moors.\\"Moir, Alexander L.,. Moir Genealogy and collateral lines : with historical notes. unknown: The author, Lowell, MA, 1913. The Moor's head is one of the most mysterious symbols in Christian heraldry. Pope Benedict XVI has placed the Moor's head in identical profile on his own coat of arms. Pope Benedict is from Germany and may have gained the heraldic symbol from a Friesland or Bavaria family descended from a Knight of the Battle of Teba. The Moir crest is not that of a triumphant victor. Instead the crest is grim memorial to fallen warriors both comrade-in-arms and enemy. The family motto in the scroll on the crest is Non sibi sed cunctis‚ÄîNot for self, but for all.\\" When setting forth the family motto, Kenneth Moir remembered the Knights Templar motto: \\"Not for self, but for God.\\" References Scottish knights ","title":"Kenneth Moir"},{"id":"4293712","text":"Graham Neil Kenneth Mourie (born 8 September 1952) is a former New Zealand All Black flanker and coach of the Hurricanes.

Here the predomination form is prosimetric, and there is a predilection, for love and adventure romance. The main hero of their adventure romances is Koroghlu. \\"The O·∏°uz Turkic versions of the K√∂ro«ßlu story are known among the Azerbaijanis, the Turks of Anatolia, and the Turkmen, and they are most similar to each other regarding language and plot.\\" The legend typically describes a hero who seeks to avenge a wrong. It was often put to music and played at sporting events as an inspiration to the competing athletes. Koroghlu is the main hero of epic with the same name in Azerbaijani, Turkmen and Turkish as well as some other Turkic languages. The epic tells about the life and heroic deeds of Koroghlu as a hero of the people who struggled against unjust rulers. The epic combines the occasional romance with Robin Hood-like chivalry. Due to the migration in the Middle Ages of large groups of Oghuz Turks within Central Asia, South Caucasus and Asia Minor, and their subsequent assimilation with other ethnic groups, Epic of Koroghlu spread widely in these geographical regions leading to emergence of its Turkmen, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tajik, Azerbaijani, Turkish, Crimean Tatar, Georgian and Kurdish versions. The story has been told for many generations by the \\"bagshy\\" narrators of Turkmenistan, fighter Ashik bards of Azerbaijan and Turkey, and has been written down mostly in the 18th century. Turkmen tradition In Turkmenistan, the epic is called G√∂rogly which translates as \\"the son of a grave\\" and holds an especially important position among Turkmen epics. The Turkmen people refer to performers specialized in G√∂rogly as dessanchy bagshy. Within Turkmenistan, dessanchy bagshy are mainly found in two regions of the country: Da≈üoguz and Lebap. Outside of Turkmenistan, the tradition is found in neighbouring countries ‚Äî including Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Iran ‚Äî and anywhere Turkmen ethnic groups have historically lived. The epic of G√∂rogly tells the story of the hero, G√∂rogly, and his forty jigits (or warriors), and includes descriptions of all major traditional Turkmen life events. Sections in prose that describe the events alternate with sections in poetry that express the characters‚Äô feelings. The first ‚Äúchapter‚Äù of the epic is the plot of the miraculous birth and heroic education of G√∂rogly (he grows up with grandfather Jygalybek and aunt G√ºlendam), raising the winged horse of Gyrat, building the Chandybil fortress and collecting squads. The following are stories about the marriage of Gorogly to a fairy-tale girl - peri Aghayunus (the hero falls in love with a girl in a dream, goes in search of her, overcomes obstacles, takes her to Chandybil), about revenge on Arab-Re√Ωhan for kidnapping the G√ºlendam, about the adoption of Ovez, about saving him from captivity and about his marriage. The ‚Äúchapters‚Äù of the G√∂rogly‚Äôs struggle with the Arab-Reyhan, the penetration of the hero into the camp of the enemy, the attack of the Sultan‚Äôs troops on the country of G√∂rogly and the abduction of Ovez, the adoption of G√∂rogly Hassan, the son of a blacksmith, are of a heroic nature. The cycle ends with the story of the death of G√∂rogly, who retired to a cave in old age. Various art forms are employed in the oral performance of G√∂rogly, including narration, singing, vocal improvisation, and acting. Dessanchy bagshy are known for their prodigious memory, outstanding musical skills, and intelligence, which are all necessary qualities for performing the epic. Performers must master traditional musical instruments‚Äîsuch as the dutar (a two-stringed plucked instrument) and the gyjak (a fiddle-like instrument)‚Äîand be able to sing various melodies of the epic and improvise on them. Under the supervision of his master, in addition to learning the repertoire and perfecting his skills, the apprentice learns moral and ethical norms of epic performance. For the transmission of knowledge, teachers use a variety of media, including printed, audio, and video materials. When the student is ready, he takes an exam. The master then gives his blessing to the new performer, who is thus granted the right to perform the epic independently and teach students of his own. This system of transmission ensures a constant flow of knowledge from one generation to the next and maintains skill levels and standards. In addition, the Turkmen National Conservatory, the State School of Culture and Arts, and various specialized school facilitate the acquisition of dutar skills by learners before they enter training with a dessanchy bagshy master. G√∂rogly plays an important role in a wide range of social functions within Turkmen communities. Values and emotions described in the epic form a basis for social interactions among Turkmen people and are reflected in social networks and relations among individuals. The epic enables Turkmen people to learn and transmit their common history and social values to younger generations. Indeed, it is used as a tool for educating the young and strengthening national identity, pride, and unity. Through G√∂rogly, youngsters are taught diligence and precise thinking skills. They are also taught to love the history and culture of their homeland. Yet respect towards other nations and cultures is encouraged. In the epic, the Turkmen people are portrayed as compassionate, wise, generous, hospitable, and tolerant. They demonstrate leadership, fearlessness, and loyalty to friends, family, and country. They respect their elders and never break promises. Because of the emphasis of these values in G√∂rogly, knowledge and skills related to the epic, including talent for music, poetry, narration, and language as well as traditional skills described in the epic‚Äîsuch as the breeding Akhal-Teke horses‚Äîare highly valued. All of these elements constitute the cultural identity of Turkmen people. The element is safeguarded thanks to gatherings and social events such as wedding ceremonies. Dessanchy bagshy competitions, regular national and religious holidays, celebrations, commemorations, and international cultural festivals also contribute greatly to the safeguarding of the G√∂rogly tradition. Dessanchy bagshy are the main promoters of traditional G√∂rogly performance as they teach and transmit the element to prospective performers in the same way they learned from their masters. In addition, each province has a bagshylar oyi (‚Äúhouse of bagshy‚Äù), where masters gather monthly to exchange ideas, record themselves, and broadcast their performances on TV and radio. This allows for the dissemination of the element among the public and attract potential new performers. Azerbaijani and Turkish tradition A theme common to nearly all versions is that of the hero‚ÄîK√∂roƒülu, literally \\"son of the blind man\\", or more directly translated as 'Blindson' (analogous with the English surname Richardson, sons of Richard), defending his clan or tribe against threats from outside. In many of the versions, K√∂roƒülu earns his name from the wrongful blinding of his father, an act for which the son takes his revenge and which initiates his series of adventures. He is portrayed as a bandit and an ozan. A number of songs and melodies attributed to K√∂roƒülu survives in the folk tradition. These songs and melodies differ from most other Turkic folk music in two aspects: they follow a rhythm of 5/8 (ONE-two ONE-two-three) and they depict heroic acts and persons. The most common version of the tale describes K√∂roƒülu as Rusen Ali, the son of the stableman Koca Yusuf lives in D√∂rtdivan under the service of the Bey of Bolu. One day, Yusuf comes across a filly which, to his trained eye, is an animal that will turn into a fine beast if well-fed. Bey wants to give good fillies to the Sultan as a present to repair their worsening relationship. However the Bey does not know enough about horses to appreciate the thin, famished animal that is presented to him. Being a man of foul and easily provoked temper, he suspects that he is being mocked and orders the poor worker to be blinded. His son, therefore, gains his nickname and harbors an ever-increasing hatred towards the Bey of Bolu in his heart as he grows up. The mare, which he names Kƒ±rat (kƒ±r at means literally \\"gray horse\\"; the word kƒ±rat can also mean \\"carat\\", \\"quality\\"), grows up with him and indeed turns into an animal of legendary stature and strength. One day, Hƒ±zƒ±r shows himself to Yusuf in a dream and tells him that soon, the waters of the river Aras will flow briefly as a kind of thick foam and whoever drinks that foam will be cured of whatever physical problems that may be ailing him, including blindness and aging. Yusuf goes to the shore of the river with his son, but his son drinks the foam before he does. As this miracle can give everlasting health and youth to only one man, Yusuf loses his chance to see again; and dies a few days later, ordering his son to avenge him. In some versions of the story, neither Yusuf nor his son can drink from the foam. Yusuf is warned by Hƒ±zƒ±r just before the phenomenon occurs, but being an old and blind man, he cannot reach the river in time. K√∂roƒülu is by the river when the foam starts flowing, but, as he is ignorant of the significance of the event, he does not drink from the river. Instead, his horse Kƒ±rat does and becomes immortal. After his father's death, K√∂roƒülu takes up arms against the Bey. As he has only a few followers, he does not engage the army of Bolu directly and uses guerrilla tactics instead. He raids and plunders his former master's property, and eludes his would-be captors by staying on the move and fleeing to distant lands whenever his enemy organises a large-scale campaign to capture him. Before he succeeds, however, the knowledge of firearms is carried by merchants to Anatolia. Even the simple guns of the time are sufficient to change the ways of the warriors forever: The balance of power is upset by the \\"holed iron\\", as K√∂roƒülu calls the tool when he first sees one, and the Beys of Northern Anatolia engage in brutal warfare with each other. The fighting goes on and on, with no end in sight. K√∂roƒülu realizes that even if he succeeds in bringing down the Bey of Bolu, he won't be able to bring back the old, chivalric world that he was born into. The warrior-poet disbands his followers and fades into obscurity, leaving only these lines behind:K√ñROƒûLU - Ozanlarƒ±mƒ±z A typical occasion where one might hear K√∂roƒülu melodies is at a traditional wrestling competition such as Kirkpinar. A team of zurna and davul players play continually as the wrestlers struggle with each other. In 1967, Ya≈üar Kemal successfully collected this legend in his epic novel √ú√ß Anadolu Efsanesi, which stands as the most outstanding K√∂roƒülu reference in contemporary literature.  Uzbek tradition  In Uzbek bakhshi tradition (\\"bakhshi\\" is a narrator of dastans or epic, usually, playing his dumbira, two-string musical instrument), the history and interpretation of K√∂roƒülu's name are different from Turkish one. \\"Go‚Äòro‚Äòg‚Äòli\\" in Uzbek just like in Turkmen means \\"the son of grave\\". As it is told, Gorogli's mother dies while being in the last months of pregnancy. However, people bury her with Gorogli inside. After some time a local shepherd notices the number of sheep is decreasing. He spies after his sheep and finds a small boy, at the age of 3-4 eating one of sheep. When he tries catch the boy, he escapes and hides in a grave. As the story narrates later he will fight against giants and kill them. It is said Gorogli had a horse called \\"G\`irot\\". The capital of Gorogli's state was in legendary Chambil.

It breeds from Costa Rica south to southern Ecuador, central Bolivia and the highlands of northwestern Venezuela. The yellow-bellied siskin breeds in mountain oak forests at altitudes between 800‚Äì3000 m. The nest is a shallow cup of rootlets, bark, and lichen 2.4‚Äì3.7 m high in the dense foliage of a small tree in a clearing. The two or three green-tinged white eggs are laid in April or May and incubated by the female. Although not migratory, this species wanders within its range when not breeding. The yellow-bellied siskin is a small bird, 10.5 cm in length and weighing 12 g. The male is entirely black except for a bright yellow belly, tail sides and wing patches. The female is dark olive green above, and has pale yellow underparts which become brighter on the belly. She has a blackish tail and wings and also has bright yellow primary wing patches and tail sides. Young birds resemble the female, but have dusky fringes to the upperpart feathers and smaller yellow wing and tail patches. The song of this bird is a pleasant chattering twitter, and the call is a sharp '. The subspecies S. x. stejnegeri which occurs from extreme southeastern Peru to central Bolivia is larger and longer-billed than nominate S. x. xanthogastrus. Males have larger yellow wing patches and more extensive black on the flanks. Females of this subspecies are darker olive above than the northern birds. The yellow-bellied siskin is more of a woodland bird than the superficially similar lesser goldfinch, Spinus psaltria, and the latter species is paler, has a white wing patch, and more musical song. The yellow-bellied siskin has been relentless persecuted for the cage-bird trade in some areas such as central Costa Rica. Where it remains common, in remote or protected areas, flocks of up to 30 birds forage in the canopy for small insects and oak flowers, or descend to clearings for seeds. The males may sing socially.

Although planned to operate separately, the two schools are adjacently-located off Jolly Pond Road near the present county school bus garage. The new schools were formally dedicated on October 2, 2010. An audience of close to 100 people joined the school board, members of the James City County Board of Supervisors and Williamsburg City Council and the families of the namesakes for the ceremony. The new schools are: * J. Blaine Blayton Elementary School, named in honor of Dr. J. Blaine Blayton, an African American physician and civic leader who lived in the Grove community in James City County. Dr. Blayton was a supporter of public education and the first African American to serve on the James City County school board. His son, Oscar, was the first African American to attend the College of William and Mary.http://www.wydaily.com/local-news/2183-its- official-j-blaine-blayton-elementary-lois-hornsby- middle.htmlhttp://www.wydaily.com/local-news/5148-blayton-hornsby-families- celebrate-dedication-of-schools.html * Lois S Hornsby Middle School, named for Mrs. Lois Hornsby, a philanthropist who has lived in Williamsburg for more than five decades.

The Blair complex was originally built as a high school, and is one of the school division's older structures. For the 2010‚Äì11 school year and the immediate future, the division plans to operate only 3 middle schools, although a newer portion of the Blair complex is scheduled to be modified to accommodate the Academy for Life & Learning, an alternative education program for older students. The school system's central administration will utilize the larger, remaining portion of Blair for its offices. While current facilities will be adequate to meet most of the system's needs, a future renovation of the Blair complex for reuse as a middle school is anticipated, possibly by 2017.http://www.vagazette.com/articles/2010/04/17/news/doc4bc90f6e920c4653880625.txt =New school for 2017‚Äì2018 school year= In 2017 a new middle school will be built on the James Blair site, with plans to be opened in fall 2018. The WJCC School Board accepted a proposal by the Superintendent on October 21, 2014. The proposal includes two phases. In the first phase, a new building will be constructed beside the current James Blair school building. In the second phase, the old building will be demolished and a new building will be constructed in its place. The final project will cost around $40 million and house around 900 students.

This domain can bind phosphatidylinositol lipids within biological membranes (such as phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate), and proteins such as the Œ≤Œ≥-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, and protein kinase C. Through these interactions, PH domains play a role in recruiting proteins to different membranes, thus targeting them to appropriate cellular compartments or enabling them to interact with other components of the signal transduction pathways. Lipid binding specificity Individual PH domains possess specificities for phosphoinositides phosphorylated at different sites within the inositol ring, e.g., some bind phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate but not phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate, while others may possess the requisite affinity. This is important because it makes the recruitment of different PH domain containing proteins sensitive to the activities of enzymes that either phosphorylate or dephosphorylate these sites on the inositol ring, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase or PTEN, respectively. Thus, such enzymes exert a part of their effect on cell function by modulating the localization of downstream signaling proteins that possess PH domains that are capable of binding their phospholipid products.  Structure  The 3D structure of several PH domains has been determined. All known cases have a common structure consisting of two perpendicular anti-parallel beta sheets, followed by a C-terminal amphipathic helix. The loops connecting the beta- strands differ greatly in length, making the PH domain relatively difficult to detect while providing the source of the domain's specificity. The only conserved residue among PH domains is a single tryptophan located within the alpha helix that serves to nucleate the core of the domain. Proteins containing PH domain PH domains can be found in many different proteins, such as OSBP or ARF. Recruitment to the Golgi in this case is dependent on both PtdIns and ARF. A large number of PH domains have poor affinity for phosphoinositides and are hypothesized to function as protein binding domains. A Genome-wide look in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that most of the 33 yeast PH domains are indeed promiscuous in binding to phosphoinositides, while only one (Num1-PH) behaved highly specific . Proteins reported to contain PH domains belong to the following families: *Pleckstrin, the protein where this domain was first detected, is the major substrate of protein kinase C in platelets. Pleckstrin contains two PH domains. ARAP proteins contain five PH domains. * Ser/Thr protein kinases such as the Akt/Rac family, the beta- adrenergic receptor kinases, the mu isoform of PKC and the trypanosomal NrkA family. * Tyrosine protein kinases belonging to the Btk/Itk/Tec subfamily. * Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). * Regulators of small G-proteins: 64 RhoGEFs of the Dbl-like family. , and several GTPase activating proteins like ABR, BCR or ARAP proteins. * Cytoskeletal proteins such as dynamin (see ), Caenorhabditis elegans kinesin-like protein unc-104 (see ), spectrin beta- chain, syntrophin (2 PH domains), and S. cerevisiae nuclear migration protein NUM1. * Oxysterol-binding proteins OSBP, S. cerevisiae OSH1 and YHR073w. * Ceramide kinase, a lipid kinase that phosphorylates ceramides to ceramide-1-phosphate. *G protein receptor kinases 2 (GRK2) subfamily 2: GRK2 and GRK3 Subfamilies *Spectrin/pleckstrin-like Examples Human genes encoding proteins containing this domain include: * ABR, ADRBK1, ADRBK2, AFAP, AFAP1, AFAP1L1, AFAP1L2, AKAP13, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, ANLN, APBB1IP, APPL1, APPL2, ARHGAP10, ARHGAP12, ARHGAP15, ARHGAP21, ARHGAP22, ARHGAP23, ARHGAP24, ARHGAP25, ARHGAP26, ARHGAP27, ARHGAP9, ARHGEF16, ARHGEF18, ARHGEF19, ARHGEF2, ARHGEF3, ARHGEF4, ARHGEF5, ARHGEF6, ARHGEF7, ARHGEF9, ASEF2, * BMX, BTK, * C20orf42, C9orf100, CADPS, CADPS2, CDC42BPA, CDC42BPB, CDC42BPG, CENTA1, CENTA2, CENTB1, CENTB2, CENTB5, CENTD1, CENTD2, CENTD3, CENTG1, CENTG2, CENTG3, CIT, CNKSR1, CNKSR2, COL4A3BP, CTGLF1, CTGLF2, CTGLF3, * CTGLF4, CTGLF5, CTGLF6, * DAB2IP, DAPP1, DDEF1, DDEF2, DDEFL1, DEF6, DEPDC2, DGKD, DGKH, DGKK, DNM1, DNM2, DNM3, DOCK10, DOCK11, DOCK9, DOK1, DOK2, DOK3, DOK4, DOK5, DOK6, DTGCU2, * EXOC8, * FAM109A, FAM109B, FARP1, FARP2, FGD1, FGD2, FGD3, FGD4, FGD5, FGD6, * GAB1, GAB2, GAB3, GAB4, GRB10, GRB14, GRB7, * IRS1, IRS2, IRS4, ITK, ITSN1, ITSN2, * KALRN, KIF1A, KIF1B, KIF1Bbeta, * MCF2, MCF2L, MCF2L2, MRIP, MYO10, * NET1, NGEF, * OBPH1, OBSCN, OPHN1, OSBP, OSBP2, OSBPL10, OSBPL11, OSBPL3, OSBPL5, OSBPL6, OSBPL7, OSBPL8, OSBPL9, * PHLDA2, PHLDA3, PHLDB1, PHLDB2, PHLPP, PIP3-E, PLCD1, PLCD4, PLCG1, PLCG2, PLCH1, PLCH2, PLCL1, PLCL2, PLD1, PLD2, PLEK, PLEK2, PLEKHA1, PLEKHA2, PLEKHA3, PLEKHA4, PLEKHA5, PLEKHA6, PLEKHA7, PLEKHA8, PLEKHB1, PLEKHB2, PLEKHC1, PLEKHF1, PLEKHF2, PLEKHG1, PLEKHG2, PLEKHG3, PLEKHG4, PLEKHG5, PLEKHG6, PLEKHH1, PLEKHH2, PLEKHH3, PLEKHJ1, PLEKHK1, PLEKHM1, PLEKHM2, PLEKHO1, PLEKHQ1, PREX1, PRKCN, PRKD1, PRKD2, PRKD3, PSCD1, PSCD2, PSCD3, PSCD4, PSD, PSD2, PSD3, PSD4, RALGPS1, RALGPS2, RAPH1, * RASA1, RASA2, RASA3, RASA4, RASAL1, RASGRF1, RGNEF, ROCK1, ROCK2, RTKN, * SBF1, SBF2, SCAP2, SGEF, SH2B, SH2B1, SH2B2, SH2B3, SH3BP2, SKAP1, SKAP2, SNTA1, SNTB1, SNTB2, SOS1, SOS2, SPATA13, SPNB4, SPTBN1, SPTBN2, SPTBN4, SPTBN5, STAP1, SWAP70, SYNGAP1, * TBC1D2, TEC, TIAM1, TRIO, TRIOBP, TYL, * URP1, URP2, * VAV1, VAV2, VAV3, VEPH1  See also  * Pleckstrin * The unrelated FYVE domain binds Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and has been found in over 60 proteins. * The GRAM domain is a structurally related protein domain.

The school was founded in 1978 by philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti. The student population of the school is around 325 from classes 1 to 12 (ages 6 to 17).  Culture  Interactions between teacher and student are informal and based on Jiddu Krishnamurti‚Äôs philosophy that \\"Learning cannot happen when there is fear\\". Freedom with responsibility is emphasized from an early age, and rewards and punishments are kept to a minimum. Students are encouraged to direct their own learning.  Intent of the School  The ethos and culture of the school is based on the teachings of J. Krishnamurti and the attempt is to: Discover a way of living that is whole, sane and intelligent and not merely concerned with intellect, memory / skills Look beyond academic excellence ‚Äì teacher and taught explore not only the outer world but also the inner ‚Äì conditioning, ways of thinking and behaviour Understand the importance and limitations of knowledge To help one to think for oneself, and out of that feel immense confidence, to be a creative human being and not a slavish machine Nurture sensitivity and compassion Jiddu Krishnamurti, long acknowledged as one of the world's foremost teachers, dedicated his life to awakening people to their own conditioning and to the possibility of freedom. He maintained, \\"A school is a place where one learns both the importance of knowledge and its limitation. It is a place where one learns to observe the world without a particular point of view or conclusion. One learns to look at the whole of man's endeavor, his search for beauty, his search for truth and a way of living that is not a contradiction between conclusion and action.It is a place where both teacher and the taught learn a way of life in which conflict ends. It is the concern of these schools to bring about a new generation of human beings who are free from self-centered action, to bring about a mind that has no conflict within itself and so end the struggle and conflict in the world about us.\\" - J. Krishnamurti A Krishnamurti School concerns itself with education of the total human being. Knowledge and intellectual capability alone are not sufficient to meet life‚Äôs challenges. Learning to enquire, to observe oneself, to relate with other people and the earth, is the core intention of the school. A Krishnamurti School is a constantly questioning, evolving institution, with the intention of creating an environment, a climate where one can bring about, if at all possible, a new human being. It is imperative therefore that parents and students understand and appreciate the intention of the school and actively participate in this movement. \\"The purpose, the aim and drive of these schools is to equip the child with the most excellent technological proficiency so that he may function with clarity and efficiency in the modern world, and far more important to create the right climate so that the child may develop fully as a complete human being.This means giving him the opportunity to flower in goodness so that he is rightly related to people, things and ideas, to the whole of life. To live is to be related. There is no relationship to anything if there is not the right feeling for beauty, a response to nature, to music and art, a highly developed aesthetic sense.\\" ‚Äì J. Krishnamurti The school sincerely attempts to translate this intent by adopting the following : Relationship between the student and the teacher- is human to human rather than position to position. Emphasis is on learning and facilitation and not teaching and absorbing. Recognize the fact that each child is unique and one size does not fit all ! Methodology and pedagogical techniques that ensure that there is no hierarchy of knowledge and suitable for differential learning capacities and learning speed Art, music, dance and sports form an integral part of the learning process Learning from nature is facilitated by the bounty all around.http://valleyschool.herokuapp.com/intent  Education and curriculum  The lower school is run based on Jiddu Krishnamurti's philosophies, where teachers and students are given freedom and flexibility. At the lower schools, the students are encouraged to think and derive at answers through guidance and correction. Along with a standard curriculum of science and humanities, extra-curricular activities are encouraged. Tests and examinations are kept to a minimum where there are no official \\"annual exam\\" till Grade 9. When a student reaches Grade 9 it will be the first time the students writes an exam conducted by the school. Higher classes follow a standard ICSE curriculum, where they appear for a nationwide public board examination at the end of class 10. Class 12 students appear for the ISC examinations conducted by the same board. The School has had a 100% Pass percentage in both 10th and 12th since the batch of 1999.  Campus  The school is set on a campus with a lake and two artificial ponds, dams, three ancient Banyan trees (over 100 years old), and lightly wooded rolling hills. However, of land was taken by the forest department of the government with clear notice and now the school campus is . Academic buildings are concentrated around the main school in the eastern section of the campus; the student dormitories, residential quarters, guesthouses and the old \\"Art Village\\" was located on the western side. The old Art Village was destroyed and taken by the Forest Department in the year 2008. The New \\"Art Village\\" is located and built around the school Amphitheater. The school had three entrances initially, the first gate being the main entrance to the school building, the second gate gave access to the football field while the third gate gave access to the Study Centre and the residential houses, as well as the Art Village. A stylized Neem Tree - which rests the highest point on the land, is the logo of the school. The school is divided into three divisions- Junior School- classes 1-4, Middle school- classes 5-7, and senior school- classes 8-12.  Transportation and Housing  Most students commute to school by bus. The buses are both privately owned and public BMTC contract buses. The school buses operate on routes in the city, picking up and dropping students off. Car pooling is encouraged. Boarding is optional and is available for classes 11 and higher. Student hostels are located on campus.  Events  * School birthday on 17 July. * J.Krishnamurti's birthday on 11 May. * Sports day on 15 and 16 August. * School Mela - first Saturday after reopening of school after Christmas vacation.  Flora and fauna  The school is a spot for regular outings of the Birdwatchers' Field Club of Bangalore. About 215 species of birds have been recorded on campus. Other creatures seen are fifteen species of mammals including deer, wild boar and elephants, a resident panthers, and twenty species of snakes, of which five are venomous. The students learn about the importance of nature and are taught to coexist with it.

He was one of the most important politicians in Louisiana during and immediately after Reconstruction and was notable for being elected after most other Republican officials had been defeated when white Democrats regained control of state politics. He is also notable as one of few incumbent Senators to be elected to the House of Representatives, where he served from 1883 to 1885. He was the last elected Republican Governor of Louisiana until Dave Treen in 1980 and the last Republican to serve as a Senator from Louisiana until David Vitter was elected in 2004. Early life and education Kellogg was born in Orwell, Vermont, near the New York border, where he spent his childhood.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jkellogg51/ATT/WPK.html After completing his education in the common schools, he moved to Peoria, Illinois, at the age of eighteen and was a school teacher for several years. His fifth cousin William Kellogg lived in the area and served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1857 to 1863. Career Kellogg became a lawyer, likely \\"reading law\\" and studying with practicing lawyers, as was typical for many then. He moved to Canton, Illinois, and started a law practice. There he joined the U.S. Republican Party and eventually came to know Abraham Lincoln, a fellow lawyer. When Lincoln became president in 1861, he appointed Kellogg as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Nebraska Territory. Kellogg moved to Nebraska. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Kellogg was granted a leave of absence and he returned to Illinois and joined the 7th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry. By 1862, he had risen to the rank of Colonel and played an important role at a small battle near Sikeston, Missouri. Kellogg resigned because of ill health on June 1, 1862. He then returned to Nebraska and resumed his work as Chief Justice. After the Civil War, Kellogg was elected as a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. In 1865, at the end of the Civil War, days before his assassination, Lincoln appointed Kellogg as the federal collector of customs of the port of New Orleans. This launched Kellogg's 20-year political career in Louisiana, notable as he was one of the first carpetbaggers. He remained Collector of New Orleans, despite complaints, until 1868, and was then elected to the United States Senate. That year, \\"reconstructed\\" Louisiana was readmitted to the federal Union. In 1872, Kellogg ran on the Republican ticket and was elected governor. He resigned from the Senate to take office. In the election, John McEnery, a Democrat, ran against Kellogg. The sitting Governor Henry Clay Warmoth, although a Republican, opposed the Republican Party faction that was loyal to President Ulysses S. Grant, who was supporting Kellogg. Warmoth supported McEnery. Former Confederate Assistant Secretary of War John Archibald Campbell was involved in the controversy surrounding Kellogg. He was a member of the \\"Committee of One Hundred\\" that went to Washington to persuade President Grant to end his support of what they called the \\"Kellogg usurpation\\". Grant initially refused to meet them but later relented. Campbell stated the case before Grant but was refused.The Ouachita Telegraph. \\"Death of a Great Jurist.\\" March 12, 1889: 1. The results of the election were disputed by the Democrats. The politics of the state was in turmoil for months, as both candidates held inauguration celebrations, certified their local candidate slates and tried to gather political power. Political tensions broke out in violence, including the Colfax Massacre in April 1873. As Governor, Warmoth controlled the State Returning Board, the institution which administered elections. With the election challenged, Warmoth's board named McEnery the winner. A rival board claimed Kellogg to be the victor, although the board had no ballots or returns to count. It was not only disputed by Democrats. Even the Republican-controlled U. S. Congress doubted the legitimacy of Kellogg's Carpetbag state government. The House of Representatives declared that the Kellogg regime was \\"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\\" The Senate threw out both returns of Louisiana's 1872 presidential electoral results. A Senate committee reported that the entire Louisiana 1872 election had been unfair and that both state governments were illegal. It recommended that a new election be held under federal supervision.William B. Hesseltine, Ulysses S. Grant Politician, (New York: Dodd-Mead & Co. 1935), 344-46 President Grant ignored the Senate committee recommendation and chose to put the force of the U. S. Army behind Kellogg's machine, perhaps because Grant's own brother-in- law, James Casey, was part of the machine. Casey also held the lucrative post of New Orleans Customs Collector, to which Grant reappointed him in March 1873. In January 1875 even President Grant admitted that Louisiana's 1872 election \\"was a gigantic fraud, and there are no reliable returns of its result.\\"William B. Hesseltine, Ulysses S. Grant Politician, (New York: Dodd- Mead & Co. 1935), 344-46, 354 According to historian William Gillette, \\"By having invoked federal authority in civil law and having employed federal force in state politics, he [Grant] had mounted a successful coups d'√©tat.\\"William Gillette, Retreat From Reconstruction,(Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1979),112 Warmoth was impeached for allegedly stealing the election. A black Republican, P. B. S. Pinchback, became governor for 35 days until Grant seated Kellogg as Governor with Federal protection. McEnery's faction established a \\"rump legislature\\" in New Orleans to oppose Kellogg's actions. McEnery urged his supporters to take up arms against Kellogg's fraudulent government. In 1874 the anti-Republican White League sent 5,000 paramilitary men into New Orleans, wherein the Battle of Liberty Place, they defeated the 3500-man Metropolitan Police and state militia. They took over the state government offices for a few days but retreated before the arrival of federal troops sent as reinforcements. President Grant had finally sent U.S. troops in response to Kellogg's request for help. Kellogg's lieutenant governor was Caesar Antoine, an African-American native of New Orleans. He had been a State Senator from Shreveport before running as lieutenant governor. Despite the intense backlash against the Republican Party among white Democrats in the South, Kellogg was elected to the United States Senate in 1876. He served in the Senate until 1883. He did not seek re-election, for his party was too weak in the South to be competitive. He was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Railroads from 1881 to 1883. Kellogg was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1882, defeating the incumbent Democrat Chester Bidwell Darrall and served one term from 1883 to 1885. He was defeated for re-election in 1884 by Edward James Gay. He continued to live in Washington, D.C., but retired from political life. He died in Washington and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. Kellogg was one of the most important politicians in Louisiana during and immediately after Reconstruction. He was able to maintain power for much longer than most Republican elected officials who had come to the area from the North. He is also notable as one of few Senators to be elected to the House of Representatives immediately after leaving the Senate.

The Museum has collected numerous steam locomotives. One of the oldest is the German one made by Orenstein & Koppel in Berlin in 1900. The Tx-1116 locomotive made by Henschel & Son (Kassel, 1918) and the Tx4-564 locomotive made by Hanomag (Hannover, 1923) are also very interesting. A real rarity is the Belgian locomotive No.2179 made by Les Ateliers Metallurgiques Nivelles with the unique wheel arrangement 4-6-2 (\\"Pacific\\"), and the only one which has steam brakes. There are also steam locomotives made in the First Polish Locomotive Plant in Chrzan√≥w, including active Px38.

He is chiefly remembered for leading a brigade of Portuguese troops under The Duke of Wellington in the Iberian Peninsular War. He is also remembered for jointly causing the removal of Sir George Prevost, governor-in-chief of British North America, for Prevost's refusal to press the attack on Plattsburgh, New York, in 1814, during the War of 1812. After his active military service Sir Manley Power was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Malta. Early life His grandfather, Sir Henry Power, was a captain of the Battle-Axe Guards.Hadden's Journal and Orderly Books: A Journal Kept in Canada and Upon Burgoyne's Campaign in 1776 and 1777, By James Murray Hadden, Horatio Rogers, Guy Carleton Dorchester, John Burgoyne, William Phillips, Published by J. Munsell's Sons, 1884 His father, Captain Lieutenant Bolton Power, served in the 20th Regiment of Foot and fought in several battles of the Seven Years' War, and later in the American Revolutionary War under Guy Carleton and John Burgoyne.History of the XX Regiment, Benjamin Smyth, Published by Simkin, Marshall, & Co., 1889 Manley Power followed in his forefather's footsteps and was a career soldier, starting as an ensign in his father's old regiment, the 20th Regiment of Foot, on 27 August 1783, when he was either 9 or 10 years old. He served in Halifax, Nova Scotia (1795‚Äì97), Holland (1799), and Menorca (1800).Herefordshire Record Office, Reference E60/IV/14, The Old Barracks, Harold Street, Hereford, HR1 2QX He was part of the force under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby at the Battle of Alexandria (1801), and later served with the Royal Horse Guards (1803‚Äì05). After rising to Lieutenant Colonel of the 32nd Regiment of Foot, he entered the Peninsular War and was attached to the Portuguese army under the command of Sir William Beresford and was promoted to lieutenant general in 1813. Peninsular war British infantry attempt to scale the walls of Badajoz One of Portugal's strategies during the Peninsular War was to place troops under British command.Wellington in the Peninsula, Jac Weller, 1992, Greenhill Books, Portuguese troops were poorly trained, but under Manley Power's leadership, Power's Portuguese were eventually regarded as equivalent to hardened British units, and saw much action, including the Battle of Salamanca, the Battle of Vitoria, the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro, the Battle near Torres Vedras, and the Battle of Nivelle. Power's Portuguese formed part of the 3rd Division when it was led by Pakenham at Torres Vedras and Salamanca, and when it was led by Sir Thomas Picton at Fuentes de Onoro and Badajoz. Brigadier-general Manley Power was specifically mentioned by ParliamentVOTE OF THANKS TO THE EARL OF WELLINGTON, &C.; FOR THE CAPTURE OF BADAJOZ, Motion by Spencer Perceval, Chancellor of the Exchequer (shortly before he was assassinated), 27 April 1812, for distinguished exertions during the bloody siege of Badajoz where the 3rd was ordered to distract the enemy through a diversionary attack with ladders against the high walls of the fortress away from the main gates, but pressed the action to the point where it became the breakthrough into the fortress (Picton was wounded scaling the ladders but continued on). Picton also led the 3rd when it broke through at Vitoria. According to Picton, the fighting by the 3rd was so intense at the Battle of Vitoria, that the division lost 1,800 men (over one third of all British losses at the battle) having taken a key bridge and village, where they were subjected to fire by 40 to 50 cannons, and a counter-attack on the right flank (which was open because the rest of the army had not kept pace).Historical Record of the Seventy-fourth Regiment (Highlanders), Richard Cannon, Published by Parker, Furnivall & Parker, 1847 Finally the 3rd was under the command of Charles Colville at the Battle of Nivelle where it took part in the main attack and then captured the bridge at Amotz under heavy resistance. War of 1812 Manley Power and two other successful Peninsular War veteran brigade leaders, Thomas Brisbane and Frederick Philipse Robinson, were sent to bolster British forces in the War of 1812 in North America (and therefore did not participate in the Battle of Waterloo). The veteran brigade leaders were deeply disappointed by Sir George Prevost's caution at the Battle of Plattsburgh. Prevost had placed Francis de Rottenburg in charge of infantry, with the brigades under his command (Power with 3500, Brisbane with 3500, and Robinson with 2500 troops). The brigade leaders were dismayed with the decision to withdraw from battle because they felt they could have easily captured Plattsburgh despite the unsuccessful British naval action.People & Stories, War of 1812 , URL accessed 18 October 2006 Their opinions carried significant weight in Britain, which led to the removal of Prevost as Commander-in-Chief, North America. The Duke of Wellington wrote on 30 October 1814, > It is very obvious to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he > has gone to war about trifles with the general officers I sent him, which > are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure > and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably > with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.Hitsman, p.267 In December, Wellington's former Quartermaster General, Sir George Murray, was sent to Canada with the local rank of lieutenant general, specifically to order Pr√©vost to return to London to explain his conduct of the Plattsburg campaign. Another Peninsular War veteran and Manley Power's previous commanding officer, Sir Edward Pakenham, became the commander of the British North American army. Manley Power took part in the Battle of New Orleans,Harry Smith Autobiography, Harry Smith, Chapter XXII, URL accessed 18 October 2006 where Pakenham was killed, which unbeknown to its participants occurred after the war had already been settled in Belgium. Occupation of France He was then reassigned to Europe in 1815 to rejoin the 3rd Division, which was still under the command of Charles Colville, to lead the 2nd Brigade, as part of the British army force occupying Flanders and France.Anglo-Allied Army in Flanders and France - 1815, The Napoleon Series, URL accessed 18 October 2006 On 25 October 1818, General Murray appointed him to be the commanding officer at Calais to oversee the evacuation of British troops from France. When it was completed, the mayor of Calais wrote a letter to express thanks for his \\"considerate treatment of the French and of the town of Calais during the embarkation.\\" Later life Sir Manley Power later served as the Lieutenant Governor of MaltaBurke's Landed Gentry (1972) for six years. Manley Power would have been familiar with the island, having been previously stationed there in 1802 with the 20th Regiment of Foot. In addition to his battle honours, for his role in Peninsular War, Portugal conferred on him Knight Commander of the Order of the Tower and Sword. The honour Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath was conferred on him on 2 January 1815. When in England, Manley Power and his family lived in Hill Court Manor, Walford, near Ross-on- Wye, Herefordshire. Based on Burke's records, he was likely Lord of the Manor of Walford, Ross, Ross Foreign, Aston Ingham, and Wilton. Sir Manley Power died on 7 July 1826, in Bern, Switzerland, after a few hours illness while returning from Malta to England. He is buried at Bath Abbey in England.Manley Power Memorial, Find A Grave, URL accessed 18 October 2006 A march named Sir Manley Power was the official quick march used by the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot (\\"the Die Hards\\"‚Äîa nickname earned at the Battle of Albuera); presumably adopting the march sometime after serving in the 2nd Division during the Peninsular war, continuing to use it as the Middlesex Regiment formed in 1881,The Handbook of British Regiments, Christopher Chant, 1988 and later as part of the 4th Battalion (Middlesex) of the Queen's Regiment.Bands, Drums and Music of The Queen‚Äôs Royal Surrey Regiment Footnotes External links William Broadfoot, ‚ÄòPower, Sir Manley (1773‚Äì1826)‚Äô, rev.

However, the stomach is a very common extranodal site for lymphomas (lymphomas originate elsewhere and metastasise to the stomach). It is also the most common source of lymphomas in the gastrointestinal tract. Signs and symptoms Symptoms include epigastric pain, early satiety, fatigue and weight loss. Most people affected by primary gastric lymphoma are over 60 years old. Risk factors Risk factors for gastric lymphoma include the following: *Helicobacter pylori *Long-term immunosuppressant drug therapy *HIV infection Diagnosis These lymphomas are difficult to differentiate from gastric adenocarcinoma. The lesions are usually ulcers with a ragged, thickened mucosal pattern on contrast radiographs. The diagnosis is typically made by biopsy at the time of endoscopy. Several endoscopic findings have been reported, including solitary ulcers, thickened gastric folds, mass lesions and nodules. As there may be infiltration of the submucosa, larger biopsy forceps, endoscopic ultrasound guided biopsy, endoscopic submucosal resection, or laparotomy may be required to obtain tissue. Imaging investigations including CT scans or endoscopic ultrasound are useful to stage disease. Hematological parameters are usually checked to assist with staging and to exclude concomitant leukemia. An elevated LDH level may be suggestive of lymphoma. Pathophysiology The majority of gastric lymphomas are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell origin. These tumors may range from well-differentiated, superficial involvements (MALT) to high-grade, large-cell lymphomas. Sometimes, it's hard to differentiate poorly differentiated high grade B-cell gastric lymphoma from gastric adenocarcinoma clinically or radiologically, yet histopathology with immunohistochemistry is recommended to stain specific markers on the malignant cell that favor the diagnosis of lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry stains specific clusters of differentiation that are present on B-cells like CD20. Cytokeratin is also a surface marker that is presented on epithelial cells, is stained histochemically and favors the diagnosis of epithelial tumors like adenocarcinoma. Differentiating poor gastric lymphoma from adenocarcinoma is essential because the prognosis and modalities of treatment differ significantly. Other lymphomas involving the stomach include mantle cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphomas which may be associated with enteropathy; the latter usually occur in the small bowel but have been reported in the stomach. Treatment Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the stomach are primarily treated with chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide+doxorubicine+vincristine+prednisone) with or without rituximab being a usual first choice. Antibiotic treatment to eradicate H. pylori is indicated as first line therapy for MALT lymphomas. About 80% of MALT lymphomas completely regress with eradication therapy. Radiation treatment for H. pylori negative gastric malt lymphoma, has a high success rate, 90% or better after 5 years. Second line therapy for MALT lymphomas is usually chemotherapy with a single agent, and complete response rates of greater than 70% have been reported. Subtotal gastrectomy, with post-operative chemotherapy is undertaken in refractory cases, or in the setting of complications, including gastric outlet obstruction.

This image was captured using confocal laser scanning microscopy Successful infection of a plant by a plant virus depends on its ability to move from the cell initially infected to neighbouring cells in order to spread infection. Unlike animal cells, plant cells have robust cell walls, which viruses cannot easily penetrate. A movement protein is a non- structural protein which is encoded by some plant viruses to allow their movement from one infected cell to neighbouring cells. Many, if not all, plant viruses encode a movement protein, and some express more than one. The movement protein of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has been most extensively studied. Plant viruses can also be transported over longer distances through the host plant in the vascular system via the phloem.  Plant virus movement between cells  Most plant viruses move between plant cells via plasmodesmata, pores between plant cell walls that allow the plant cells to communicate with each other. Plasmodesmata usually only allow the passage of small diffusible molecules, such as various metabolites. Neither virus particles nor viral genomic nucleic acid can pass through plasmodesmata unaided.  Function of movement proteins  Movement proteins modify the plasmodesmata by one of two well-understood molecular mechanisms. The movement proteins of many plant viruses form a transport tubule within the pore of the plasmodesmata that allows the transport of mature virus particles. Examples of viruses that use this mechanism are cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). The second mechanism by which movement proteins work is by associating with and coating the genome of the virus, causing the ribonucleoprotein complexes to be transported through plasmodesmata into neighbouring cells. TMV's 30 KDa movement protein acts via this mechanism, although it may also have other roles in infection.

He is best known for producing major reference works, including a 5-volume Dictionary of the Bible and a 13-volume Encyclop√¶dia of Religion and Ethics, and establishing The Expository Times.  Life  He was born in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, the second son and fifth child of local miller James Hastings. His initial education was undertaken at Huntly School and Aberdeen Grammar School. He studied classics at the University of Aberdeen, graduating with a Master's degree in 1876. He then attended the Free Church Divinity College in Aberdeen in preparation for ordination as a Free Church minister. While studying at the college, he also worked as a teacher at Chanonry House School, a private school for boys in Old Aberdeen. Following a period as assistant minister in Broughty Ferry, Dundee, Hastings was ordained in 1884, becoming minister at Kineff Free Church in Kincardineshire. After 13 years, he was called to Willison Church in Dundee, but returned to Kincardineshire in 1901, having struggled with his city placement. From 1901 until his retirement in 1911, he was the minister at the United Free Church in St Cyrus. During his period in office, he oversaw the erection of a new church building for the congregation. In one obituary, his preaching was described as \\"evangelical in sentiment, thoughtful and expository in style, fluent in delivery, and fervent in application.\\" Hastings married Ann Wilson Forsyth in 1884, the year of his ordination. They had two children: Edward (21 March 1890 ‚Äì 1 August 1980) and Ann Wilson (21 April 1885 ‚Äì 23 March 1975). Edward later also became a minister of the United Free Church. He received honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from the University of Aberdeen (1897) and Queen's University in Nova Scotia (1920). After his retirement, Hastings returned to Aberdeen, where he became a member of Beechgrove United Free Church. He died unexpectedly on 15 October 1922. His funeral was held on 18 October, and he was buried at Springbank Cemetery in Aberdeen.  Works  Hastings edited many reference works, which are still in use today. In 1913, he was awarded the biennial Dyke-Acland Medal for his services to biblical research. During his time at Willison church, Hastings founded the Expository Times, which he edited until his death. After his death, his children took over joint editorship of the journal until 1942, when C. Leslie Mitton became editor. The Expository Times continues to be issued monthly. He also established and edited a weekly periodical for Sunday School teachers, entitled The Sunday School. This ran for 104 editions between December 1892 and December 1894.

Her solo exhibitions include shows at the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies, Banff (1985); the Dunlop Gallery, Regina (1986); and Gallery 1.1.1., Winnipeg (1987). She was a co-founder in 1985 of the Stride Gallery in Calgary. Scott is quoted as saying \\"I have no interest in a monologue with respect to my work. I'm very interested in dialogue, in discourse and the polyvocal. The monologue which is plunked on the wall or plunked on the floor is very unsatisfactory to me.\\" Scott's work embraces text as a central player in its performance. One half of her installation, \\"Hearing Voices\\", drapes words constructed from oil paint over her personal book collection. The text for this piece comes from Scott's first novel, which was inspired by the writings of Gertrude Stein. This text is a product of \\"smashing\\", according to Scott. \\"I did this a lot in the late ‚Äô70s, where I would go in and take from one or two writers and 'smash' [their work] together.\\" Scott cites Stein as a continuous influence on her practice, and says Stein's writing is also responsible for her foray into aural territory. \\"My practice is painting, but a lot (of my work) has never had a dot of paint on it. People will say, ‚ÄòOh my god, how can you call this painting?

He was preceded by King Teritnide and succeeded by King Tamelerdeamani. The reasons for believing that he was a separate individual from Teqerideamani II is unclear: only one inscription and one tomb (Beg.N.28) have been found for both rulers. Derek A. Welsby in the table of rulers in his The Kingdom of Kush lists two Teqerideamanis‚Äîassigning the tomb to the earlier one, and the inscription to the later‚Äîbut in one of the chapters he states both the tomb and the inscription belong to the later one. Because the dating of the kings of Nubia in this period are based on the a seriation of their pyramidal tombs (first proposed by George A.

Hosted by Wayne Cox (who previously hosted Second Honeymoon and Talk About), announced by Terry Reid and produced by Blair Murdoch, the show was shot at the CKVU-TV studios in Vancouver and originally aired on the Global Television Network in 1991. It was brought back in 1994, but it was later put into repeat syndication on Global and its sister specialty channel, Prime Television (now known as DTour), both having shown every episode. GameTV aired 40 episodes of the show until it was removed from the channel's schedule in October 2012. The show no longer airs. Rules Each episode of Acting Crazy featured two teams of four, each having one contestant, one celebrity and two \\"house players\\" (recurring players hired by the show), playing several rounds. In each round, one member of each team was brought out onto the centre stage and given a charade to act out to his or her team. Those charades are movie titles, song titles, TV shows, famous people, phrases, places, quotes, and often, wildflowers, etc. That person had one minute to successfully communicate to his/her team whatever (s)he was given. The clock counted up from 0 seconds to 1 minute. The time it took to complete each charade was added to a score for each team, and at the end of the show, the team which had acted out all of its charades in the fastest aggregated time won a prize for its contestant, and the champion would return the next day to defend against a new player. Should the reigning champion win 5 straight games, he/she would receive a chance to select prizes from the \\"Acting Crazy Galleria\\" (also referred to by Wayne as \\"Blair's Prize Emporium\\" during the 1994 tapings); in addition to winning a regular prize in 1994. Midway through each episode, the contestants switched teams, taking their times with them, and the last round included a side prize which went to the team who had completed its charade the fastest in that round only. In the first few episodes, the time limit in the final round would be 30 or 45 seconds. The five house players (of which four would appear on any given show) were Sue Burge, Melody Davies, Gary Jones, Billy Mitchell and Denis Simpson. (Burge and Davies, who are sisters, later competed as one of thirteen teams in the 2001 Travel TV series, The Great Race.) Burge, Davies and Simpson also appeared as contestants on Talk About in 1988/89 which was also hosted by Cox.

It is based on the 1982 novel The Religion by Nicholas Conde. Plot After his wife Lisa dies from an accidental electrocution, psychologist Cal Jamison relocates with his young son, Chris, from Minneapolis to New York City, where Cal begins working as a police psychologist for the New York City Police Department. The city has been plagued by a series of brutal, ritualistic child murders. The first victim is a young boy found murdered in an abandoned movie theater. A policeman named Tom Lopez frantically phones in the discovery of the body, and claims the crimes are being committed by members of an Hispanic cult practicing a malevolent version of brujer√≠a. Cal is appointed to examine Tom, who raves about the cult's powerful leader. A second victim is found eviscerated on a makeshift altar beneath a dock in Staten Island. Cal begins to inquire about brujer√≠a to Carmen, his housekeeper and nanny, who practices a benevolent form of it, leaving protection charms in the apartment for Cal and Chris. The following day, Tom, paranoid and being followed by mysterious men, stabs himself to death in a diner. Later, Cal and his new girlfriend, Jessica, attend a party where a mysterious Caribbean man, Palo, attempts to steal a necklace from Jessica; shortly before, Jessica had left her compact in the bathroom, and unbeknownst to Jessica, Palo rubs the pad with his fingers. When Cal returns home, he finds Carmen performing a ritual on Chris, and angrily throws her out of the house, despite the fact that she assures him she is attempting to protect him. Chris accompanies his affluent Aunt Kate and Uncle Dennis on a trip to stay at their country home. Meanwhile, Cal and Jessica consult Oscar Sezine, a friend of Tom's, who believes the cult is planning a ritualized murder for the summer solstice in four days time. Oscar performs a purification ritual in an attempt to ensure the safety of Chris, whom he worries may be targeted as a sacrifice for the solstice. The next morning, Jessica finds a boil on her face and falls ill. Before departing to reunite with Kate, Dennis, and Chris in the country, Cal receives a frantic phone call from police lieutenant Sean McTaggert. Cal arrives at McTaggert's apartment, finding it in disarray, and McTaggert seated with a gun, rambling in a paranoid manner. He shows Cal a photo and secret file he uncovered documenting elite businessman Robert Calder's ritual murder of his own son. Cal leaves with the file at McTaggert's insistence. After he leaves, McTaggert commits suicide. Meanwhile, Jessica has a panic attack after the boil on her face bursts baby spiders break free from the wound. While Cal tends to Jessica in the hospital, Kate leaves him a voice message that she has changed her plans and is going to return Chris to him, but the message is cut short. Unaware Kate has called, Cal departs the hospital with his friend Marty, who drives him to Kate and Dennis's country house. Upon arriving, Dennis tells Cal that Kate has gone to a 24-hour grocery store. In the living room, Dennis recounts he and Kate's travels to the Caribbean when Kate was a graduate student, and how they witnessed the power of a human sacrifice. Palo and Calder then enter the room, along with a number of other cultists, urging Cal to join, and stating that Chris has been predestined to become a sacrifice. Cal flees the house through an upstairs window after finding Chris no longer in his room. In the boathouse, Cal finds Kate's dead body before he is knocked unconscious by Palo. Cal is driven to an abandoned factory, where Chris's ritual murder is to be carried out among the cult. Cal thwarts the sacrifice by stabbing Dennis to death, and Marty, who followed them to the warehouse, comes to Cal's aid, shooting various cultists from an upper landing. Calder abducts Chris and the two ascend to the top of the warehouse in a freight elevator. Marty is incapacitated with a blowpipe dart by Palo, but not before he severely burns Palo's face, blinding him. Cal manages to chase Calder into a storage room, stabbing him to death before retrieving Chris. Cal puts Chris down and a blinded Palo attacks Cal, but falls off the scaffolding when Chris coaxes him toward him and is impaled on rebar below. Cal carries Chris and they escape from the warehouse. Some time later, Cal, Jessica (who is fully recovered from her attack), and Chris go to Move to a farm. In the barn loft, Cal finds a shrine adorned with various sacrificed animals. He is approached by Jessica from below, who admits responsibility, telling him they \\"will be safe now\\" as Cal looks on in shock. Cast Analysis Barna William Donovan notes that there were several Satanic-themed Hollywood films in the 1970s. Citing as examples The Exorcist (1973) and The Omen film series (1976-1991). But he also noted that Hollywood seemed to have lost interest in the subject by the 1980s. He cites The Believers as one of only two noteworthy films about Devil worship created in the 1980s, the other one being Angel Heart (1987). Though he notes that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) also touched on the similar subject of a demon-worshiping cult, which abducts children and offers human sacrifices.Donovan (2011), p. 129-130 He points out that Angel Heart was a period piece set in the 1940s, and so fantastic that it limited its connections to the contemporary world of the 1980s \\"and its fundamentalist paranoias\\", while The Believers was set in that contemporary world. The villains were not, however, worshipers of the Judeo-Christian Satan. Instead they were practitioners of Santer√≠a, the legitimate Afro-Caribbean religion depicted in the film as \\"a cult of evil that condones human sacrifice\\". Neither film approached the subject of the 1980s hysteria over Satanic ritual abuse, a conspiracy theory which generated sensationalist headlines in this decade. Donovan concludes that Hollywood distanced itself from the subject matter, probably because child sexual abuse was deemed an unfit subject for popcorn entertainment. According to John Kenneth Muir, the message of the film is that yuppies would do anything for success, including calling upon dark gods.Muir (2007), p. 558-559 Muir points similarities to The Possession of Joel Delaney (1972), as both films fear ethnicity. For example, in The Believers, a cleaning woman working for the Jamisons tries to protect Chris by using a benevolent version of Santeria. Cal fails to distinguish between good and evil magic and treats her as a threat.Muir (2007), p. 558-559 The film depicts Manhattan as a place where alien cultures merge and the Christian white man has reasons to fear the pagans, who may come for his children. As such, it plays on a fear for the ethnic, racial, and religious Other.Muir (2007), p. 558-559 Roger Ebert complained that most films about Caribbean religions tend to involve \\"guys with blank eyes\\" and animal sacrifice, bloodthirsty cults, sadistic killers, and a quest for innocent blood; they never depict any positive aspect to these religions. He found this to be a prejudiced treatment.Ebert (2000), p. 36-38 He also complained that the film makes use of multiple ritualistic details (such as circles of ashes, blood, and charms), without ever bothering to explain their meaning.Ebert (2000), p. 36-38 According to Mercedes Cros Sandoval, the film brought both public attention and negative publicity for Santer√≠a.Sandoval (2008), p. 366 The film is more typical of its decade in the negative depiction of the upper class of New York City. The cultists turn out to be members of this social class which literally sacrifice their children in exchange for \\"fame, wealth, and power\\". Their success and upward mobility is based not on business acumen, but their practice of Santeria. Muir sees this as a literal interpretation of a familiar phrase, voodoo economics.Muir (2007), p. 558-559 Muir notes a few similarities with Rosemary's Baby (1968). An evil cult is depicted as active in a modern city, hiding in plain sight. And a couple of limousine liberal friends of the Jamisons are revealed to be cultists in their own right.Muir (2007), p. 558-559 For Muir, the highlight of the film involves the depiction of a voodoo-like curse. Jessica Halliday (Helen Shaver) accidentally leaves her compact in a bathroom while snooping around in Calder's office. By the time she retrieves it, it has become a cursed item. While using it, something \\"gets under her beautiful skin\\". It manifests as a boil, which gets progressively redder and more inflamed. Finally it swells to capacity, and spiders start emerging from the boil's interior.Muir (2007), p. 558-559 Release =Controversy= The Believers was shown to have influenced the Santer√≠a- based cult established by Adolfo Constanzo and supported by Sara Aldrete in Matamoros, Mexico.Rolling Stone (1989), p. 35-36 =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Believers holds an approval rating of 35%, based on 17 reviews, and an average rating of 4.85/10. Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of 4, denouncing the film as \\"an awesomely silly, tasteless, and half-witted movie.\\" Dennis Schwartz' from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade C+, calling the film \\"muddled\\", and criticized the film's cheap scares, writing, and lack of a believable storyline. However, not all reviews of the film were negative. Hal Hinson from The Washington Post gave the film a mostly positive review, writing, \\"The Believers is a bizarre, occult thriller about the implications of religious faith. And, though it doesn't expand upon its shock tactics as much as it would like to or make its theological points, the movie's dread atmosphere begins to seep into your head.\\" Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"Gripping\\", and \\"genuinely frightening\\". Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror praised the film, writing, \\"While The Believers feels familiar on a surface level, its use of Santeria mythology and Schlesinger's deft blend of suspense and graphic shocks provide enough flavor to separate it from the flock.\\" References Sources  External links  1987 films 1987 horror films 1980s thriller films American films American horror thriller films American supernatural horror films English-language films Films directed by John Schlesinger Films set in Minnesota Films set in New York City American neo-noir films Films about cults Films based on American horror novels Nannies in films Orion Pictures films Religious horror films Santer√≠a Films with screenplays by Mark Frost American supernatural thriller films Films scored by J.

It can be discovered as part of the diagnostic workup of pituitary disorders, or as an incidental finding when imaging the brain. Signs and symptoms Patent ductus arteriosus If there are symptoms, people with empty sella syndrome can have headaches and vision loss. Additional symptoms would be associated with hypopituitarism. Additional symptoms are as follows: * Abnormality (middle ear ossicles) * Cryptorchidism * Dolichocephaly * Arnold-Chiari type I malformation * Meningocele * Patent ductus arteriosus * Muscular hypotonia * Platybasia Cause Pituitary gland The cause of this condition is divided into primary and secondary, as follows: * The cause of this condition in terms of secondary empty sella syndrome happens when a tumor or surgery damages the gland, this is an acquired manner of the condition. * ~70% of patients with Idiopathic intracranial hypertension will have empty sella on MRI * The cause of primary empty sella syndrome is a congenital defect (diaphragma sellae) Mechanism The normal mechanism of the pituitary gland sees that it controls the hormonal system, which therefore has an effect on growth, sexual development, and adrenocortical function. The gland is divided into anterior and posterior. Its pathophysiology is such that individuals affected with the condition can have cerebrospinal fluid build-up, which in turn causes intracranial pressure leading to headaches for the individual. Diagnosis MRI The diagnosis of empty sella syndrome, done via examination (and test), may be linked to early onset of puberty, growth hormone deficiency, or pituitary gland dysfunction (at an early age). Additionally there is: ::::::::*CT scan ::::::::*MRI scans =Classification= There are two types of empty sella syndrome: primary and secondary. * Primary empty sella syndrome occurs when a small anatomical defect above the pituitary gland increases pressure in the sella turcica and causes the gland to flatten out along the interior walls of the sella turcica cavity. Primary empty sella syndrome is associated with obesity and increase in intracranial pressure in women. In most cases, especially in people with primary empty sella syndrome, there are no symptoms and it does not affect life expectancy or health. Some researchers have estimated that less than 1% of affected people ever develop symptoms of the condition. * Secondary empty sella syndrome is the result of the pituitary gland regressing within the cavity after an injury, surgery, or radiation therapy. Individuals with secondary empty sella syndrome due to destruction of the pituitary gland have symptoms that reflect the loss of pituitary functions, such as intolerance to stress and infection. =Differential diagnosis= The major differential to consider in empty sella syndrome is intracranial hypertension, of both unknown and secondary causes, and an epidermoid cyst, which can mimic cerebrospinal fluid due to its low density on CT scans, although MRI can usually distinguish the latter diagnosis.  Treatment  In terms of management, unless the syndrome results in other medical problems, treatment for endocrine dysfunction associated with pituitary malfunction is symptomatic and thus supportive; however, surgery may be needed in some cases.

Life Raeburn was born in 1865 at 12 Grange Loan, Edinburgh. His father William Raeburn, a brewer, married Jessie Ramsay in 1849. Harold Raeburn was their fourth son, and he grew up to enter his father's occupation as a brewer. He died in Edinburgh, on 21 December 1926, and was buried in Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh. Mountaineering Everest Expedition 1921: Raeburn is standing on the right. =Scotland= It is not documented how or why Raeburn began climbing as a sport, but his early enthusiasm in ornithology led him to climb or descend many steep faces, in search of nests and eggs. A collection of eggs by him is kept in National Museums Scotland, Edinburgh. Living under Edinburgh's Salisbury Crags and possessing a wiry, athletic build he soon adapted to the vertical world of rock and ice. As to his character, he very obviously possessed the necessary determination and drive of any ambitious and hard mountaineer; Lord Mackay provided a good description of Raeburn, writing that he was \\"... physically and mentally hard as nails, trained by solitary sea-cliff climbing after birds' haunts, he was certain, unyielding and concise in every movement, both mental and physical.\\" Mackay went on to remark that Raeburn had a capacity of grip that was astonishing: \\"He was possessed of strong muscular fingers that could press firmly and in a straight downward contact upon the very smallest hold.\\" Raeburn remained a bachelor all his life but he climbed with both men and women, including his sister Ruth, herself an expert climber, and Jane Inglis Clark, a founder of the Scottish Ladies Mountaineering Club. The (all-male) Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC) was founded in 1889 and Raeburn joined in 1896. Within a few years he became its leading climber serving as Vice-President from 1909 to 1911 and later turning down the Presidency. He recorded many classic routes throughout Scotland: there are several \\"Raeburn's Gullies\\" scattered across the land. Carn Mor Dearg Arete is on the skyline. First ascents On Ben Nevis in particular, he left a tremendous legacy of high- quality routes; indeed, \\"of the 30 new routes on Nevis from 1896 to 1921, his name appears on exactly half.\\" These include a solo first ascent of Observatory Ridge (V.Diff.) in June 1901, Observatory Buttress (V.Diff.) solo in June 1902, his outstanding eponymous Arete (Severe) two days later on North-East Buttress with William and Jane Inglis Clark, and the first winter ascent of Green Gully (IV,4) in 1906. The latter ascent, with a Swiss alpinist called Eberhard Phildius, was barely recognised in a later guidebook, as he had not climbed the rocks of the Comb on the left, but had instead followed snow and ice in the gully. Indeed, Raeburn's ascent was completely forgotten by 1937, when J. H. B. Bell made the second winter ascent, thinking it was the first. Of Phildius himself little is known; he was almost certainly present in Fort William to meet up with another SMC member, the Rev. A. E. Robertson, as Phildius was involved in the Youth Christian Movement. On Buachaille Etive M√≤r in Glen Coe, Raeburn made the first three ascents of Crowberry Gully, including a wintry 1909 ascent, and the second ascent and first Scottish ascent of Crowberry Ridge Direct (1902), then the hardest rock climb in Scotland. His style of rock climbing was very muscular; he held himself close to the rock, while his particular attention to the exact times of ascents could frequently drive his companions to exasperation. There is a humorous reference to this: when one fellow SMC member climbed a new route left of Raeburn's Arete on Ben Nevis he called it \\"Newbigging‚Äôs 80-Minute Route\\", this being an echo of \\"Raeburn‚Äôs 18-Minute Route\\" climbed the previous year on the same buttress. In Easter 1920, during the SMC Meet at Fort William, Raeburn made what perhaps his finest winter ascent in Scotland ‚Äì the first of Observatory Ridge on Ben Nevis. With fellow members Mounsey and Goggs, and using a 100 ft rope, the three finished the route in just under six hours, with one long ice axe each and no crampons. =Europe= From 1902 Raeburn climbed without guides, and he joined the Alpine Club in 1904. In the Alps he recorded fine climbs, including the first British guideless ascent of the Zmutt ridge of the Matterhorn in 1906, the ascent of the north face of Monte Disgrazia in 1910 with his friend Willie Ling, the first solo traverse of the Meije, as well as first ascents in Norway and the Caucasus. He made two expeditions to the Caucasus, in 1913 and 1914. During the first his party made first ascents of five mountains, and attempted Ushba, being turned back by poor conditions. In 1914 four mountains were climbed, with Raeburn descending to learn that war had broken out. =World War I and after= Raeburn's book, Mountaineering Art was in manuscript when World War I began, and long, hard hours in an aeroplane factory for the next six years stopped all climbing. At 49, he was too old for the Royal Flying Corps. Following the end of the war, in 1919 Raeburn celebrated by returning to the Alps and made a solo traverse of the Meije ridges. His book was finally published in 1920, having been postponed due to the war. Also in 1920, Raeburn joined an expedition to Kanchenjunga, and he was mountaineering leader on the initial 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition under the leadership of Colonel Charles Howard-Bury. He worked hard at organising and preparing the party while suffering from influenza. By the time the expedition reached Tibet dysentery had broken out. One member of the party died, and Raeburn himself had to be carried down, spending two months in hospital. Against common sense, he returned to the expedition, but he was by then exhausted and never recovered his former fitness. Declining health lead to his eventual death five years later. Sailing His other sport was sailing, and he raced yachts in the Firth of Forth. With his brother John, he raced as a member of the Royal Forth Yachting Club, based in Granton. They were successful enough to win the club's Corinthian Cup three times. Being presented with the Cup, they in turn presented it back to the RFYC, who renamed it the Raeburn Trophy. This is the name under which it is still raced. Ornithology Raeburn was a keen ornithologist. His diaries on the sea birds of the Shetland Islands and other species are lodged in the archives of the Department of Natural Sciences, National Museums Scotland. For some years these diaries could not be found, but a recent search unearthed them. He was the first to describe the birds on Lyra Skerry Raeburn, H. 1891. The birds of Papa Stour, with an account of the Lyra Skerry. Zoologist (3rd series) 15: 126-135 Commemoration The SMC Raeburn Hut, between Dalwhinnie and Newtonmore, was opened in 1988 and is named after him. There is a faint geographical connection here, as Raeburn was the first to explore the steep cliffs on nearby Creag Dubh, Newtonmore. Raeburn's ice axe is one of two seals of office held by the president of the SMC. References Some climbs on the Salisbury Crags by W.

Much of the range is bordered on the east by Flathead Lake. With peaks ranging from just under 7,000 feet tall to named hills that are a little short of 3,600 feet in elevation the Salish Mountain range is a lesser known mountain range in northwestern Montana. Many of the peaks in the range are rounded tree-covered summits but occasionally the mountain summits are found on open grassy slopes that afford great views into the surrounding valleys and neighboring mountain ranges. The Salish Mountains cover a triangle-shaped land mass of about 4,125 square miles of lush forests and peaks. The Salish Mountains are named for the Native Americans who called this area their home for centuries before white man settled here. The Salish originated in the Pacific Northwest and were called the Flathead Indians by the first white men who came to the Columbia River. The Flatheads call themselves Salish meaning \\"the people\\". Although never a large tribe, the Salish had a reputation for bravery, honesty, and general high character and for their friendly disposition towards the whites.

Until 1990 it was a separate municipality, which boasted the title 'reddest (most socialist) municipality in the Netherlands', with a council of 11 containing 7 PvdA (Labour Party) members and 2 CPN (Communist Party) members. (However, nearby Reiderland had had a vast CPN majority since WWII, so the claim is rather too strong). When a new mayor had to be appointed in 1980 (at the time a municipality had no say in the matter), it was assumed that it would become a PvdA mayor as it had always been. However, the then minister of the interior, Hans Wiegel of the right-wing VVD, decided that this very left-wing part of the Netherlands needed a change and appointed a D66 (left of centre) mayor. This led to a cold reception and the first time a Dutch mayor was not officially inaugurated. Over time, however, people started to like him and when he moved to a bigger municipality there was even an action to keep him (to no avail). Not much later, the method of appointing a mayor in the Netherlands was changed, with the municipality putting up a request which is usually followed.

It is noted for its high production values, directorial technique and psychological depth of acting, especially by Ivan Mosjoukine. It is considered to be one of the best pre-revolutionary Russian films. The film was the second production of the story, the first being the silent short film adaptation of the Pyotr Tchaikovsky opera by Pyotr Chardynin in 1910. Yakov Protazanov uses a wide combination of narrative, staging and camera techniques, many of which were unusual for that time, including retrospection, visions (prototypes of the stream of consciousness), split screen combination shots, flashbacks, jump cuts, deep focus and deep staging, and dissolves. Plot As described in a film magazine, Hermann, a Russian military officer with a limited fortune, is fascinated when he hears the story of Countess Fedotovna, who won her fortune by playing three particular cards, the identity of which she refuses to reveal. Hermann gains entrance to the countess's house through a flirtation with Lizaveta, ward of the countess. He confronts the countess with a revolver and demands to know the cards she played. The countess collapses, dead of fright. Remorseful, Hermann goes home. The next morning he seems to see the phantom of the countess, who tells him that the three cards are the three, the seven, and the ace. The first two nights he plays the three and the seven and is successful. The third night he bets all of his money, feeling sure that the card will be the ace. However, he finds his own card has become the queen of spades and he has lost everything. With the loss of his fortune he also loses his mind.

Early life Wakelin was born in Whyalla, South Australia on 12 August 1974, a few minutes after his identical twin brother Darryl, who was born just before midnight on 11 August. When Wakelin was six months old his family moved to Kimba, South Australia where his father farmed sheep. Wakelin was 13 when he moved to Port Lincoln, South Australia. At 16 he and his brother were recruited by South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Port Adelaide and they made the move to Adelaide. AFL career Recruited from Port Adelaide by St Kilda in the 1992 AFL Draft, Wakelin debuted in the Australian Football League (AFL) in 1994. He became noted as a hard-working defender at St Kilda and, during the mid to late 1990s, was part of a defensive combination with his twin brother Darryl which was considered very effective. Wakelin played in five of 22 matches in the 1997 AFL season home and away rounds in which St Kilda qualified in first position for the 1997 AFL Finals Series, winning the club‚Äôs 2nd Minor Premiership and 1st McClelland Trophy. After playing only four games in 2000 he became disgruntled with St Kilda and was later picked up by Collingwood Football Club, where he reignited his career and continued his trademark consistency as a defender. Wakelin signed on for the 2007 AFL season knowing he would probably spend much time in the reserves. Due to injuries to other Collingwood backmen, however, he was often selected and was crucial in defence for Collingwood during that year. For the 2008 AFL season, due to the sudden retirement of fellow Collingwood backman James Clement, Wakelin agreed to another season for the Magpies. At the end of the 2008 season he retired after Collingwood's loss in the semi final against St Kilda ended the team's season. In 2003 Wakelin appeared on a shampoo commercial for Sunsilk Base Elements, which also featured fellow Collingwood players Brodie Holland and Richard Cole. This wooden performance earned him the \\"Tool of the Year\\" on AFL variety show Before the Game. Environmental activism Wakelin is a strong supporter of sustainable transport, and famously sold his car in 2007 for environmental reasons, using public transport and bicycles as an alternative, even to travel to football matches he was playing in. On 5 June 2012, he took part in a stunt for Melbourne radio station Gold FM's breakfast program which involved a competition to see which mode of transport would get someone from Nunawading railway station to the Gold FM studio in Richmond in the shortest time. Wakelin took the train and won the competition, completing the journey in 41 minutes. The motorist took 49 minutes, with the bike rider taking 53 minutes. Personal life Wakelin married Ligita in 2003 and they now have two children ‚Äì daughter Charley Elizabeth, and son Tom Leo. Wakelin was one of the four St Kilda players featured at the start of the 1995 music video Greg! The Stop Sign!! by Australian band TISM.

For the small mountain range in British Columbia, Canada, also known as Mission Mountain, see Mission Ridge (British Columbia). For the summit in California see Mission Peak. The Mission Mountains or Mission Range are a range of the Rocky Mountains located in northwestern Montana in the United States. They lie chiefly in Lake County and Missoula County and are south and east of Flathead Lake and west of the Swan Range. On the east side of the range is the Swan River Valley and on the west side the Mission Valley. The highest point in the Mission Mountains is McDonald Peak at . The range is named for its proximity to the Jesuit St. Ignatius Mission, established in the mid-19th century in what is today St. Ignatius, Montana.  Geology  The Mission Mountains are composed largely of what is called \\"Belt Rock\\" from the Belt Supergroup. The sedimentary rocks in this group formed between 1.47 and 1.4 billion years ago in the Belt Basin. The roughly circular basin collected sediments from surrounding areas for millions of years. The basin was eventually buried and later re-exposed through the collision of several tectonic plates around 80 million years ago. Much of the Belt Rock found in the Mission Mountains is a crumbly sedimentary rock known as mudstone. The mudstone in the Belt supergroup is often characterized by mudcracks, which points to it being formed while wet, drying, cracking, and then being repeatedly flooded with new wet material that also dried and cracked. Most of the rock in the Mission Mountains hails from the end of the Proterozoic Eon, towards the end of what is called Precambrian time. Because they are so old, the only evidence of life in the rocks are algae blooms and very basic plant fossils. These organisms played, however, the important role of converting carbon dioxide in the water into oxygen that was pumped into the acidic and poorly oxygenated atmosphere. The color of the mudstone in the Missions has much to do with the presence of the mineral hematite during its formation. Hematite is formed by iron particles' reaction to oxygen in the atmosphere. Green and gray stones found in the Missions were most likely formed in deep water, the red in more shallow water. Ripple marks can be found in much of the rock; they would have formed mostly in shallow water with gentle waves. = Uplift = Mission Mountains viewed from the National Bison Range The features of the Mission Mountains strongly reflect work of the last few ice ages, the latest of those being just over 10,000 years ago. But the range is also the product of a much longer story, one that can be started with the breakup of the Pangaea super-continent. As the continents began to spread out, the North American Plate inched westward, grinding over and against the Pacific Plate as it went. This subduction of the Pacific Plate caused the rise of the Rocky Mountains and thereby the Missions. About 66 million years ago, this process of uplift began to slow. This time, called the Cenozoic Era, is when the area began to look much like it does today. Looking at the globe at that time, the continents would have been about where they are today and plant and animal life would be recognizable. At that time, however, the deep valleys of western Montana would not yet have formed. This development is believed to have come about 40 million years ago as the extensional forces that caused the uplift of the Rockies began to cause the crust to thin and crack. Near-vertical faults formed almost uniformly throughout the region, most trending northwest to southeast. The blocks then broke up, some dropping and creating valleys like the Flathead and the Swan. In all, the whole process took around 100 million years. = Pleistocene glaciation = Three million years ago, at the end of the Cenozoic Era, western Montana would have been full of tall mountains, but it was the next geologic process that made them what they are today. Large glaciers began to form in the area 2‚Äì3 million years ago; this was the beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch. Since then, ending just 10,000 years ago, the Mission Mountains and their surroundings have been shaped by water. The formation of the Flathead Lobe of the Alberta Cordilleran ice sheet is what set this history into motion. At its thickest points, the Flathead Lobe glacier may have extended 4,000 feet above the valley floor. The glacier reached hundreds of miles down the Rocky Mountain Trench, ending as far south as St. Ignatius, Montana. At the northern end of the range, the glacier flow split, in part flowing slowly into the Swan Valley. A view of the area at that time would have been majestic, with large glaciers flowing around both sides and partially over the range. Smaller glaciers would have also flowed out of the mountains and joined the larger one in the valley. This explains the southward pointed, hook-shaped ridges at the end of each canyon in the range. These processes also gave the Mission Mountains their distinct shapes. The many three-sided peaks, called horns or pyramidal peaks, and the knife-like ridges of the southern half of the range are results of the heavy mountain glaciation. The northern half of the range was largely rolled over by the Flathead Lobe, which was much like a huge moving ice sheet. This led to the shorter, more rounded features of the northern half of the range. The Pleistocene was a time of dramatic and quick sculpting in the Mission Mountains. And though that epoch has ended, the erosion continues. Rain, snow, ice, wind, and other forces continue to work at the alpine landscape of the Missions.  Human History  Recorded human contact with the Mission Mountains began with the native peoples thousands of years ago and runs up to the present. The Salish and Kootenai people have traditionally used the mountains as a place for fishing, hunting, berry-picking, and for performing sacred ceremonies. The first major outside attention to the Mission Mountains came in the 1920s. Forest service employee Theodore Shoemaker led several parties of visitors thorough the range between 1922 and 1924, one of which included members of the Great Pacific Railway Company, which owned a great deal of land in the range. On a 1923 trip Shoemaker triangulated the locations of several peaks, which led to the first map of the high country. The first major protective action for the Mission Range came on October 21, 1931 when 67,000 acres of land along the east side of the Mission Divide were classified as the Mission Mountains Primitive Area. The Great Pacific Railway Company owned 30 percent of this land at the time of the classification, which was exchanged over the course of years for other land in the Flathead National Forest. Further stories about the Mission Mountains and the surrounding area can be found in the local books, In the Shadows of the Missions and Indian Trails and Grizzly Tales.  Hiking and Recreation  As most of the Mission Mountains fall under special protection, land use is limited largely to recreation. The best time to hike in the Mission Mountains is between the beginning of July and October. Winter ends late in the high country and even in the beginning of July hikers will often find high passes and lakes snow- covered and wet. Snow starts to fly as early as October and hiking season is over by the end of the month. Winter recreation is best in the spring months. June is wet, but between February and May one can do some great winter camping, snowshoeing and skiing. Hikers unfamiliar with the range should know that only a few of its hikes are \\"easy\\". The terrain, especially in the south is very steep and trails are not always kept clear. If you leave the trail and start scaling the rocks you will find out quickly that 1.5-billion-year-old mudstone is very brittle and not a very reliable handhold. Climb around with caution. In the daytime it can be very hot, but nights are very cold, so pack accordingly. Though the Missions aren't huge, it is always a good idea to bring a map. The USGS topographic maps of the area are available at local sporting goods stores and not a bad thing to have in your pack. Because the range is a protected wilderness area, motorized trail bikes, motorcycles, three- and four-wheelers, snowmobiles, hang-gliders and mountain bikes are not permitted. Getting caught with one will result in a ticket. The range has about 45 miles of official trails. Experienced hikers can, however, break off onto the plethora of game and Indian trails that often cut through the rougher terrain. Horses can be taken used on most official and some other trails, but Missions are a rough and before riding in the Missions riders should consult local experts. People wishing to take horses into the range need to consult the Flathead National Forest requirements, which include hay restrictions and other rules. Several spectacular waterfalls grace the western slope of the Missions, in the Tribal Wilderness Non-tribal members passing through land belonging to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes are required to carry a valid tribal lands-usage permit, which can easily be obtained at local sporting goods stores. The pass is good for one year and allows access to the Mission Mountains, stretches of the Flathead River, among others.  Protected Areas  The Mission Mountains have several overlapping protection areas. Much of the Mission Mountain Range is falls under the management of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation. Most of the range is also part of the Flathead National Forest, under which the Mission Mountains Wilderness is designated as a wilderness area. The wilderness area is in the Swan Lake Ranger District. The 73,877 acre wilderness was designation on Jan. 4, 1975 and is managed under the Wilderness Act of 1964. The southern end of the Mission Mountains includes a large grizzly bear protection area which is usually closed to hikers from July thru September. This allows the bears to feed on lady bugs and cut worms, and attempts to keep bear-human contact to a minimum.  Ecology  A trailside view, Mission Mountains, north of Rainbow Lake The Mission Mountains have a wide range of flora and fauna. Mule deer, elk, white-tailed deer, mountain goats, moose, black bears, grizzly bears, coyote, wolverine, lynxes, bobcats and mountain lions have all been spotted in the range. Smaller animals found in the Missions include hoary marmots, yellow-bellied marmots, snowshoe rabbit, pika, chipmunk, squirrel, porcupine, muskrat, badger, skunk, beaver, marten, weasel, and mink. Western Montana's famous huckleberry is also found all over the slopes of the Mission Mountains in the mid-to-late summer. They are a favorite for hikers and grizzly bears alike. The most common trees found in the range are the ponderosa pine, western red cedar, douglas fir, western larch, western white pine, lodgepole pine, limber pine, whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, alpine fir, grand fir, western larch, quaking aspen, alder, and Rocky Mountain maple. Cedars most often grow in the creek bottoms while others are spread throughout the landscape. Up in the higher reaches of the Missions one finds the alpine larch. Found between the elevations of about 6,500 feet-7,000 feet this tough little tree can be found all over the range, twisted and tangled along high ridges and surrounding its peaks.  Notable features  A view of Mullman Lakes in the Mission Mountains in western Montana. Out of the frame, to the right is Mount Calowahcan.

Developed in 1902 by radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi from a method invented in 1895 by New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford it was used in Marconi wireless stations until around 1912, when it was superseded by vacuum tubes. It was widely used on ships because of its reliability and insensitivity to vibration. A magnetic detector was part of the wireless apparatus in the radio room of the RMS Titanic which was used to summon help during its famous 15 April 1912 sinking. copied on Stephenson's marconigraph.com personal website  History  One of the first prototype magnetic detectors built by Marconi in 1902, in Milan museum. The sensing coils on this instrument are removed. Recreation of a Marconi ship radio room at the Aalborg Maritime Museum, Aalborg, Denmark. A magnetic detector is on the desk to right of the Marconi tuner receiver, which provided the signal for the magnetic detector. The primitive spark gap radio transmitters used during the first three decades of radio (1886-1916) could not transmit audio (sound) and instead transmitted information by wireless telegraphy; the operator switched the transmitter on and off with a telegraph key, creating pulses of radio waves to spell out text messages in Morse code. So the radio receiving equipment of the time did not have to convert the radio waves into sound like modern receivers, but merely detect the presence or absence of the radio signal. The device that did this was called a detector. The first widely used detector was the coherer, invented in 1890. The coherer was a very poor detector, insensitive and prone to false triggering due to impulsive noise, which motivated much research to find better radio wave detectors. Ernest Rutherford had first used the hysteresis of iron to detect Hertzian waves in 1896 by the demagnetization of an iron needle when a radio signal passed through a coil around the needle, however the needle had to be remagnetized so this was not suitable for a continuous detector. Many other wireless researchers such as E. Wilson, C. Tissot, Reginald Fessenden, John Ambrose Fleming, Lee De Forest, J.C. Balsillie, and L. Tieri had subsequently devised detectors based on hysteresis, but none had become widely used due to various drawbacks. Many earlier versions had a rotating magnet above a stationary iron band with coils on it. Phillips (1980) Early radio wave detectors, p. 103-105 This type was only periodically sensitive, when the magnetic field was changing, which occurred as the magnetic poles passed the iron. During his transatlantic radio communication experiments in December 1902 Marconi found the coherer to be too unreliable and insensitive for detecting the very weak radio signals from long distance transmissions. It was this need that drove him to develop his magnetic detector. Marconi devised a more effective configuration with a moving iron band driven by a clockwork motor passing by stationary magnets and coils, resulting in a continuous supply of iron that was changing magnetization, and thus continuous sensitivity (Rutherford claimed he had also invented this configuration). The Marconi magnetic detector was the \\"official\\" detector used by the Marconi Company from 1902 through 1912, when the company began converting to the Fleming valve and Audion-type vacuum tubes. It was used through 1918.  Description  (A) Antenna wire, (B,B) Iron band around pulleys, (C, C) RF excitation winding on glass tube through which the iron band travels, (D) Audio pickup winding, (E) Ground-plate, (S, N) Permanent magnets, (T) Telephone receiver. See drawing at right. The Marconi version consisted of an endless iron band (B) built up of 70 strands of number 40 gage silk-covered iron wire. In operation, the band passes over two grooved pulleys rotated by a wind-up clockwork motor. The iron band passes through the center of a glass tube which is close wound with a single layer along several millimeters with number 36 gage silk-covered copper wire. This coil (C) functions as the radio frequency excitation coil. Over this winding is a small bobbin wound with wire of the same gauge to a resistance of about 140 ohms. This coil (D) functions as the audio pickup coil. Around these coils two permanent horseshoe magnets are arranged to magnetize the iron band as it passes through the glass tube.  How it works  The device works by hysteresis of the magnetization in the iron wires. The permanent magnets are arranged to create two opposite magnetic fields each directed toward (or away) from the center of the coils in opposite directions along the wire. This functions to magnetize the iron band along its axis, first in one direction as it approaches the center of the coils, then reverse its magnetism to the opposite direction as it leaves from the other side of the coil. Due to the hysteresis (coercivity) of the iron, a certain threshold magnetic field (the coercive field, Hc) is required to reverse the magnetization. So the magnetization in the moving wires does not reverse in the center of the device where the field reverses, but some way toward the departing side of the wires, when the field of the second magnet reaches Hc. Although the wire itself is moving through the coil, in the absence of a radio signal the location where the magnetization \\"flips\\" is stationary with respect to the pickup coil, so there is no flux change and no voltage is induced in the pickup coil. The radio signal from the antenna (A) is received by a tuner (not shown) and passed through the excitation coil C, the other end of which is connected to ground (E). The rapidly reversing magnetic field from the coil exceeds the coercivity Hc and cancels the hysteresis of the iron, causing the magnetization change to suddenly move up the wire to the center, between the magnets, where the field reverses. This had an effect similar to thrusting a magnet into the coil, causing the magnetic flux through the pickup coil D to change, inducing a current pulse in the pickup coil. The audio pickup coil is connected to a telephone receiver (earphone) (T) which converts the current pulse to sound. The radio signal from a spark gap transmitter consisted of pulses of radio waves (damped waves) which repeated at an audio rate, around several hundred per second. Each pulse of radio waves produced a pulse of current in the earphone, so the signal sounded like a musical tone or buzz in the earphone.  Technical details  Magnetic detector in use The iron band was turned by a mainspring and clockwork mechanism inside the case. Differing values have been given for the speed of the band, from 1.6 to 7.5 cm per second; the device could probably function over a wide range of band speeds. The operator had to keep the mainspring wound up, using a crank on the side. Operators would sometimes forget to wind it, so the band would stop turning and the detector stop working, sometimes in the middle of a radio message. The detector produced electronic noise that was heard in the earphone as a \\"hissing\\" or \\"roaring\\" sound in the background, somewhat fatiguing to listen to. Phillips (1980) Early radio wave detectors, p. 98, 102, 106 This was Barkhausen noise due to the Barkhausen effect in the iron. As the magnetic field in a given area of the iron wire changed as it moved through the detector, the microscopic domain walls between magnetic domains in the iron moved in a series of jerks, as they got hung up on defects in the iron crystal lattice, then pulled free. Each jerk produced a tiny change in the magnetic field through the coil, and induced a pulse of noise. Because the output was an audio alternating current and not a direct current, the detector could only be used with earphones and not with the common recording instrument used in coherer radiotelegraphy receivers, the siphon paper tape recorder. From a technical standpoint, several subtle prerequisites are necessary for operation. The strength of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets at the iron band must be of the same order of magnitude as the strength of the field generated by the radio frequency excitation coil, allowing the radio frequency signal to exceed the threshold hysteresis (coercivity) of the iron. Also, the impedance of the tuner that supplies the radio signal must be low to match the low impedance of the excitation coil, requiring special tuner design considerations. The impedance of the telephone earphone must roughly match the impedance of the audio pickup coil, which is a few hundred ohms. The iron band moves a few millimeters per second. The magnetic detector was much more sensitive than the coherers commonly in use at the time, although not as sensitive as the Fleming valve, which began to replace it around 1912. In the Handbook Of Technical Instruction For Wireless Telegraphists by: J. C. Hawkhead (Second Edition Revised by H. M. Dowsett) on pp 175 are detailed instructions and specifications for operation and maintenance of Marconi's magnetic detector.

From a very early age, Ironside showed a strong interest in evangelical Christianity and was active in the Salvation Army as a teenager before later joining the \\"Grant\\" section of the Plymouth Brethren. The family then moved to Los Angeles, California, on December 12, 1886, and finding no Sunday school there for him to attend, Harry started his own at age 11. Gathering old burlap bags, Harry and his childhood friends sewed them together, producing a burlap tent that could accommodate up to 100 people. Unable to find an adult teacher, Ironside himself did the teaching, with attendance averaging 60 children‚Äîand a few adults‚Äîeach week. In 1888, well-known evangelist Dwight L. Moody preached at a campaign in Los Angeles, with meetings held at Hazard's Pavilion,Cinema Treasures  Clune's Auditorium (later known as \\"Temple Pavilion\\") which could seat up to 4,000. This inspired Ironside, who hoped to also be able to preach to such crowds one day. In 1889, after a visit from evangelist Donald Munro, Ironside became convinced that he was not \\"born again\\", and so gave up preaching at his Sunday school, spending the next six months wrestling with this spiritual problem. After an evening of prayer, in February 1890, Ironside, at age 13, accepted Christ. As he is quoted as saying years later, \\"I rested on the Word of God and confessed Christ as my Savior.\\" Ironside then returned to preaching, winning his first convert. Though he was taunted at school, he was undeterred from his mission to win souls. Later that year, his mother remarried, to William D. Watson. Ironside graduated from the eighth grade, began working as a part-time cobbler, and decided he had enough education (he never attended school again, which he later regretted). During the days, young Ironside worked full-time at a photography studio, and at night he preached at Salvation Army meetings, becoming known as the \\"boy preacher\\". At age 16, he left the photography business and became a preacher full-time with the Salvation Army. Commissioned a Lieutenant in the Salvation Army, Ironside was soon preaching over 500 sermons a year around Southern California. At 18, the grueling schedule had taken its toll on his health, and Ironside resigned from the Salvation Army, entering the Beulah Rest Home to recuperate. In 1896, at 20, he moved to San Francisco, becoming associated again with the Plymouth Brethren. While there, he began helping at British evangelist Henry Varley's meetings and there met pianist Helen Schofield, daughter of a Presbyterian pastor in Oakland, California. The two soon married. In 1898, Ironside's mother died, and less than a year later, Harry and Helen's first son, Edmund Henry was born. In 1900, the family moved across the bay to Oakland, where Harry resumed a nightly preaching schedule. They resided there until 1929. In 1903, Ironside accepted his first East Coast preaching invitation, but on returning, the family only had enough funds to make it as far as Salt Lake City, Utah, where he spent the next ten days doing street preaching. Just as the last of their money for a hotel ran out, they received an anonymous envelope with $15, enough to return to Oakland. In 1905, a second son, John Schofield Ironside, was born. During this time, Ironside also began his career as a writer, publishing several Bible commentary pamphlets. In 1914, he rented a storefront and established the Western Book and Tract Company, which operated successfully until the depression in the late 1920s. From 1916 to 1929, Ironside preached almost 7,000 sermons to over 1.25 million listeners. In 1918, he was associated with evangelist George McPherson; and in 1924, Ironside began preaching under the direction of the Moody Bible Institute. In 1926, he was invited to a full-time faculty position at the Dallas Theological Seminary, which he turned down, although he was frequently a visiting lecturer there from 1925 to 1943. After preaching a series of sermons at the Moody Church in Chicago, he was invited in 1929 to serve a trial year as pastor. The following year he became the official pastor, and he served there until 1948. Almost every Sunday he preached at Moody Church, with the 4,000-seat auditorium filled to capacity. Nevertheless, he continued to preach in other US cities as well; and in 1932, he began traveling abroad. In 1938, Ironside toured England, Scotland and Ireland, preaching 142 times to crowds of upwards of 2,000. In 1942, he also became president of the missionary organization, Africa Inland Mission. In 1935, Ironside preached the funeral of Billy Sunday at Moody Church. In 1930, Wheaton College presented Ironside with an honorary Doctorate of Letters degree, and in 1942 Bob Jones University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree.Faith Hall of Fame - Henry Allan Ironside In 2011, Bob Jones University renamed a residence hall that formerly honored Bibb Graves after Ironside.<.ref>http://www.bju.edu/welcome/visit/map/residence-halls/ BJU website] , accessed June 4, 2011. Bob Jones, Jr., wrote that although Ironside was considered a dignified man, when one got to know him, \\"he had a terrific sense of humor. Nothing was more fun than to have a good meal in a home somewhere when Dr. Ironside was present. After he was full‚Äîhe could eat a lot, and he ate faster than any man I ever saw, and his plate would be empty before everyone else got served‚Äîhe would sit back, push his chair back from the table, and begin to tell funny stories and personal experiences.\\"Bob Jones, Cornbread and Caviar (Greenville: Bob Jones University Press, 1985), 65. Never one to ask money for himself, Ironside was skilled at raising money for other evangelical causes and was often asked to take the offering at Bible conferences. He joked that his tombstone would read, \\"And the beggar died also.\\"English, 205. A few months after he and his wife Helen celebrated their golden wedding anniversary, Helen died on May 1, 1948. Ironside resigned as pastor of Moody Church on May 30 and retired to Winona Lake, Indiana. On October 9, 1949, he married Annie Turner Hightower, of Thomaston, Georgia. He suffered from failing vision, and after surgery to restore it, he set out on November 2, 1950, for a preaching tour of New Zealand, once more among Brethren assemblies, but died in Cambridge, New Zealand, on January 15, 1951 and was buried in Purewa Cemetery, Auckland. Theological influence Along with others such as Cyrus Scofield, he was influential in popularizing dispensationalism among Protestants in North America. Despite his lack of formal education, his tremendous mental capacity, photographic memory and zeal for his beliefs caused him to be called, \\"the Archbishop of Fundamentalism\\".Harry A. Ironside bio Ironside was one of the most prolific Christian writers of the 20th Century and published more than 100 books, booklets and pamphlets, a number of which are still in print. He also wrote a number of hymns including \\"Overshadowed\\".Overshadowed One editorial reviewer wrote of a 2005 republication that, \\"Ironside's commentaries are a standard and have stood the test of time.\\"Michael Catt, amazon.com Works =Commentaries= In Canonical Order *Lectures on the Levitical Offerings (1929) *Addresses on the Book of Joshua (1950) *Notes on the books of Ezra (1920) *Notes on the books of Nehemiah (1913) *Notes on the books of Esther (1905) *Notes on the books of Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther (Compilation 1951) *Studies on Book One of the Psalms (1st edition 1952.

It is based on the character Winnie the Pooh. Plot The Hundred Acre Wood was populated with characters from A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh series of short stories. Each character had lost an item of value to them and wanted the item returned. The player moves through the Hundred Acre Wood and collects the missing items then returns them to their rightful owners. Only one item can be carried at a time, so picking up one item means leaving behind of whatever item is currently being carried. Some screens have interactive sub-elements. For example: you could \\"climb\\" Pooh's tree and see the limb where he kept his honey pots safely out of the reach of flood waters (a reference to a scene in the Disney animated movie The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and Chapter 9 of A.A. Milne's book Winnie-the-Pooh). The game has no animation in the mode of a traditional Quest game such as King's Quest. Rather, the Hundred Acre Wood existed as a grid of connected static screens. Players move between the screen using the arrow keys and can only move North, South, East or West. The missing items are randomly assigned at the start of each new game to screens within this grid, although the various characters can always be found on the same screens. When an item is \\"dropped\\" on a screen in order to \\"pick up\\" another item, the dropped item stays on that screen until the user returns to retrieve it later, but not all items belong to one of the characters - for example, a board belongs to the bridge. Reuniting a character with their item results in a celebration screen. At random points, the items can be lost if the player runs into Tigger (who bounces them), or when the wind starts again.

The latter was supported by the Teutonic Knights, by this point vassals of Poland, who were seeking a revision of the recently signed Second Peace of Toru≈Ñ.  Political background  The Bishopric of Warmia was, in the 14th century, part of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights, but enjoyed autonomy and was administrated as a prince-bishopric. The bishops, often members of the Teutonic Order, were loyal to the order even in early 15th century, when the Teutonic Knights raised the taxes to pay for the resulting costs of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìTeutonic War. Eventually, the order's policies and tax increases led to opposition within Prussia and to the foundation of the Prussian Confederation in 1440 by Prussian cities who wanted to defend their rights against the order. The Prussian Confederation eventually asked for external aid and allied with the Polish king Casimir IV, asking to be incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland. This led to the Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì1466). The bishop of Warmia, Paul von Legendorf (1458‚Äì1467), joined the Prussian Confederation in the last year of the conflict (1466). The Second Peace of Thorn (1466) put Royal Prussia under the suzerainty of the Polish king. As part of the treaty, the king of Poland had the right to approve the bishop of Warmia, as chosen by the Warmian chapter.  Election dispute  In 1467, the chapter chose as bishop Nicolaus von T√ºngen, while the Polish king promoted Wincenty Kie≈Çbasa (at the time Bishop of Che≈Çm) for the position. It was T√ºngen who was approved by the pope, but he was unable to take the seat de facto and instead resided in Riga. Unable to get the pope's approval for Kie≈Çbasa, Casimir changed tack and nominated Andrzej Oporowski, his chancellor, as bishop (T√ºngen was to receive the Bishopric of Kamie≈Ñ). Oporowski however, unlike Kie≈Çbasa, did not have the support of the Prussian estates as he was not from the region. This resulted in a dispute in which T√ºngen was supported by the Teutonic Order and Matthias Corvinus, the king of Hungary. With help from the Order T√ºngen was able to come to Warmia in 1472. In 1476 Corvinus invaded southern Poland and a year later Heinrich Reffle von Richtenberg, the grand master of the order, refused to provide military support to Casimir, his sovereign. Casimir responded by courting the support of the Prussian Estates and cities. He granted Che≈Çmno Law to several cities, affirmed existing privileges and withdrew the candidature of Oporowski. As a result, the Prussians re-swore their fealty to the king of Poland and refused to support the order. Likewise, Gda≈Ñsk, the largest city in Polish Royal Prussia declined to support to the Order and Corvinus.  Military action  In 1477 Martin von Wetzhausen, the new grand master of the order refused to make his oath of fealty to the Polish king and invaded Warmia, taking Che≈Çm and Starogard Che≈Çminski. In response, in 1478, Polish forces of King Casimir IV intervened militarily, besieging Braniewo. Under the command of Jan Bia≈Çy and Piotr Dunin, the Polish forces occupied several cities in Warmia and Pomesania. The Teutonic Knights' military operations were hampered by the refusal of the Prussian Estates to support them. T√ºngen was forced to flee to K√∂nigsberg (Kr√≥lewiec). At the same time, in April 1479, the Polish and Hungarian kings came to an agreement and Corvinus withdrew from the anti- Polish alliance. As a consequence by July 1479, both T√ºngen and the grand master were forced to pay homage to the Polish king.  Settlement  The first Treaty of Piotrk√≥w (in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski) ended the feud in 1479. The Polish king accepted Nicolaus von T√ºngen, who had been elected in 1467, as bishop, and granted or confirmed several prerogatives of the bishopric. The bishop acknowledged the sovereignty of the Polish king over Warmia, obliged the chapter to elect only candidates \\"liked by the Polish king\\" and the Warmians had to pledge allegiance to him. Politically Warmia remained under lordship of the Polish crown. 15th-century conflicts Priests Wars involving the Teutonic Order 15th century in Poland Warfare of the Middle Ages Diocesan feuds ","title":"War of the Priests (Poland)"},{"id":"4294236","text":"Western Norway University of Applied Sciences () or HVL is a Norwegian public institution of higher education, established in January 2017 through the merging of formerly independent colleges across five campuses: Bergen, F√∏rde, Haugesund, Sogndal and Stord.

The source code of HelenOS is written in C and published under a BSD License.  Technical overview  The microkernel handles multitasking, memory management and inter-process communication. It also provides kernel-based threads and supports symmetric multiprocessing. Typical to microkernel design, file systems, networking, device drivers and graphical user interface are isolated from each other into a collection of user space components that communicate via a message bus. Each process (called task) can contain several threads (preemptively scheduled by the kernel) which, in turn, can contain several fibers scheduled cooperatively in user space. Device and file-system drivers, as well as other system services, are implemented by a collection of user-space tasks (servers), creating thus the multiserver nature of HelenOS. Tasks communicate via HelenOS IPC, which is connection-oriented and asynchronous. It can be used to send small fixed-size messages, blocks of bytes or to negotiate sharing of memory. Messages can be forwarded without copying bulk data or mapping memory to the address space of middle-men tasks.  Development  HelenOS development is community-driven. The developer community consists of a small core team, mainly staff and former and contemporary students of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University in Prague, and a number of contributors around the world.HelenOS Contributors measured by Ohloh In 2011, 2012 and 2014, HelenOS participated in the Google Summer of Code as a mentoring organization.List of projects accepted into Google Summer of Code 2011List of projects accepted into Google Summer of Code 2012List of projects accepted into Google Summer of Code 2014 In 2013, the project was a mentoring organization in the ESA Summer of Code in Space 2013 program.

A number of ohu (see intentional community) were set up in rural areas of New Zealand under a government scheme established in the mid-1970s. Background In the 1970s, the third Labour Government of New Zealand (1972‚Äì75) under Prime Minister Norman Kirk was reportedly known for its strong social conscience in both international and domestic affairs (Govt Whips Office 1974, Bassett 1978, Hayward 1981). The government confronted the global nuclear arms race by strong opposition to French testing in the Pacific. As a nation, New Zealand sponsored non-proliferation measures such as the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone (later embodied in the Rarotonga Treaty of 1986) and South Pacific Environmental programme. The Labour Government ended national conscription and New Zealand‚Äôs contribution to the Vietnam War upon coming to power in 1972. Notably also, they cancelled the visas of a visiting Springboks in early 1974 to show its opposition to the regime of apartheid in that country. On the domestic front, it demonstrated its commitment to environmental protection by setting up a Royal Commission on Nuclear Power in 1974, and the establishment of the Guardians of the Rotorua Lakes and Lake Manapouri (both 1973). In October 1974, the Labour Government announced the establishment of the ohu scheme for groups of New Zealand citizens willing to set up alternative communities in rural areas. The purposes of the scheme Forster and Metcalf suggest the Ohu movement was intended to remove radicals from urban settings. However statements from the then Prime Minister, Norman Kirk, and the Minister for Lands, Matiu Rata, suggest the purposes were: * To assist people in becoming self-sufficient from the land. * To enhance people's spiritual and social wellbeing. * To reconnect people to the land. * To give people a chance to develop alternative social models. * To provide a communal environment as a potential antidote \\"to the ills of modern society[...]\\" (Hayward 1981 p. 173.) * The promotion of the virtues of a simpler life (Hayward 1981, p. 173). * To be a place of healing for participants as well as for society as a whole. The 1975 brochure about the scheme suggested it may be of interest to people keen on organic farming, alternative energy and recycling and referred to the Kibbutz as an inspiration but that communities were not expected to be a copy of this. Matiu Rata also emphasised the social implications of this alternative land settlement scheme. For Rata, the scheme had a strong MƒÅori spiritual dimension: \\"For some time now I have been concerned with the needs of that section of society that has worked so hard to gain social, economic and cultural integrity while trying to maintain spiritual and cultural strength and self-respect. I refer of course, to the MƒÅori section of our society\\". (Matiu Rata to the Ohu Working Party, August 1974). Additional points * Over 30 sites were approved by the government for the establishment of ohu. * Many of these sites were reportedly of poor quality and very remote. * About eight communities were originally established, Sunburst Ohu, near Whitianga, Coromandel, was the first in to be approved in August 1974. * The longest lasting of the Ohu communities was Ahu ahu ohu, which ceased in about 2000. When the Ahu ahu ohu was first founded access required crossing the river and a walk in of nearly an hour. The former community is now a point of interest for tramping. * Although the National government had voiced support for the scheme prior to the election, when it came into power in 1975 it wound up the Ohu advisory committee and eventually did away with the scheme altogether.

Players start out in Seattle and must make decisions concerning supplies, a partner, and travel plans as they head to Alaska before boating down a river to Dawson City and staking a claim. The game features the famous author Jack London and old 19th century photographs that show what life was like back then. Gameplay Screenshot of conversation with Jack London. =Start= The game starts in Seattle in August 1897 (right before the actual Gold Rush). The player must first choose one out of four partners. Each partner has unique advantages over the others. Next the player purchases two tickets for a ship to Skagway or Dyea. Tickets are more expensive for ships that depart immediately, and less expensive for those departing later. The player can buy equipment, food and other items, or they can wait until they get to Alaska. The player's partner can offer their advice on making purchases, but their advice is sometimes unwise. Upon reaching Skagway or Dyea, the player can purchase any supplies, gamble or gather information. Gambling takes the form of a War card game or a Shell game, but can be unfair and lead to losses for the most part. Gambling can be disabled in the settings. When starting the journey the player can choose the long and easy White Pass Trail or the short and difficult Chilkoot Trail. The player can also hire packers in the two cities that would haul their supplies to the respective routes. =The Trail= The Yukon Trail gives players plenty of opportunities to think about the situation, giving many options and many possible consequences for each event, thus building problem solving skills. The initial choice players make on the trail, which can be subsequently changed, is the load personally carried. A smaller load results in the ground moved each day to become shorter (as some of the supplies have to be left behind and then returned for). Moreover, the trail becomes much more difficult to travel when encroaching upon the winter months. However, a larger load will result in a higher probability of the player or partner being injured. Midway down the trail, the player and partner stop at a camp. They can then buy or sell goods before climbing the mountain pass leading to the Canada‚ÄìUS border where they pay a toll to pass into the Yukon Territory. The North-West Mounted Police will not let them pass unless they have 1000 pounds of food per person. They are also required to pay a tax to bring goods into Canada. After the price for the tax is given, if the player does not have enough, the Mountie will simply take whatever money they have. Along the trail, numerous random events can occur. Random events include: someone being injured (the player decides to continue at a slower pace or to rest), theft of food, rockslides, crowds of people or abandoned animals, and sudden inclement weather. Periodically, the player stops at landmarks along the journey, where players can learn historical facts about each location. Some include the Dead Horse Trail, the totem poles, and the three rapids: Miles Canyon, White Horse Rapids and Five Finger Rapids. =The River= Five Finger Rapids is among the landmarks featured in The Yukon Trail. This 2005 photo shows the Five Finger Rapids as viewed from the Klondike Highway The player and partner arrive at Bennett Lake after hiking into Canada. While there, they meet the legendary Mountie Sam Steele. During the winter they need to acquire a whipsaw if they do not already have one and then build one of three boats. Once the spring arrives and the ice has melted, the player and partner can embark with their boat. Depending on the date of their arrival at Lake Bennett, Sam Steele will let them depart right away, or have them wait two or four days before departure. On the river, the speed is determined by the type of boat chosen, and how much damage it has sustained. The choices for boats include a dinghy, a raft, or a canoe. The dinghy is balanced, the raft handles well but is slow, and the canoe is fast but handles poorly. There are a few minigames, which involve guiding the boat away from rocks and whirlpools. After the minigame, if the boat has been damaged, the player can choose to repair the boat or build an entirely different one. The player and partner will eventually reach Dawson City, where they are presented with a map of claims they can stake. There, they meet Nellie Cashman and author Jack London. Once they have staked a claim, they can begin searching for gold. With the arrival of winter, the game ends. The player's score is determined by the amount of money they have (from the entire journey, including gold). Most claims will yield small amounts of gold, but at least one claim can get you the high score. One notable claim is Cheechako Hill, which is always available. Staking Cheechako Hill will always result in the player becoming rich. Historically, the initial wave of prospectors ignored Cheechako Hill because only a cheechako (newcomer) would think there was gold so high up the hillside, but it turned out to contain rich deposits.

The reserve was opened by celebrity bird-watcher Bill Oddie in May 2000. Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory Trust proposed the design and a management plan which included modifications to ditches and control of water levels to create ecological conditions that attract wetland species of plants, animals and birds. Historically the land was reclaimed from the river and sea by the monks of Sandwich and the northern boundary is still the old Monks' wall of the 13th century. In the 1953 floods the sea covered the whole area around Sandwich and after these fields were drained a new river bank was created and the land ploughed for arable farming with heavy use of fertiliser. The site covers and attracts many rare and migratory birds such as long-billed waders and the red-rumped swallow. The nature reserve recreates wet grazing meadows which were common before land was drained for agriculture. Returning the site to its natural state has also allowed the establishment of many other indigenous plants and animals. The current warden is Ken Chapman.

The gameplay resembles that of MECC's other \\"Trail\\" games, in which players must prepare for a long journey, choose their traveling companions, and make it safely to their destination. In Africa Trail, players must travel across Africa via bicycle. The game includes a Multimedia Resource Tool to allow players to make their own journal and presentation of the journey.  Start  The object of the game is to make it to Cape Agulhas, South Africa in a limited number of days. First the player must pick a route, going for the longer route from Bizerte, Tunisia or two shorter routes from Lagos, Nigeria or Nairobi, Kenya. Next the player must pick three out of six possible teammates for the team. Teammates differ by profession, skills, biking experience, travel experience, and trek preferences. Certain teammates will make the journey easier and more likely to reach the final destination in good time. The player's team will start with a bike each, basic supplies and money to buy food, additional supplies and lodging. Then the player needs to buy spare parts for the bikes. The player can carry up to 300 pounds worth of items.  The Trail  Before the player can enter a new country, visas stamps are required on the passports, which can be obtained in large or capital cities, otherwise the player will be forced to backtrack. Visas cost money and take a number of days to be registered. Communication with the locals varies depending on the language qualifications of your teammates. The bike team will need to eat and rest from time to time. Food can be purchased in the form of groceries (which are cheaper and last longer, but do not nourish much) or meals (which adequately nourish, but spoil after a short time and are more expensive) to feed the bike team. Additional bike parts can also be purchased to make bike repairs. Accommodations are provided in lodgings to allow the bike team to rest. Prices will vary depending on locality and on the currency the player uses. Purchases can be directly bought, bargained for, or purchased using a credit card. Everything bought adds to the weight packed. The player cannot exceed the maximum weight the bike team can carry. The bike team's travel depends on their health and morale levels (the player does not have a morale level). Health decreases should a teammate sustain injuries, catch some health problem along the journey, or go hungry. If health runs out, the player or teammate will die. Morale decreases when a teammate finds the player's decisions unreliable and loses hope of completing the journey. If morale runs out, the teammate will leave the team. Design =Development= The game makes use of over 1,000 photos and two dozen video clips obtained from a 12,000 mile trek across Africa by world-famous cyclists, including Dan Buettner, who made his \\"Africatrek\\" in 1992. MECC offered Washington Apple Pi members a special 5-pack CD-ROM collection of their adventure games, including this title. =Educational goals= The game shows players the different cultures and travel routes in Africa. The topics covered in the game include Geography, History, People and Cultural Diversity. In addition the game teaches the importance of careful decision making and managing available resources as well the hardships of Third-World countries. Reception =Critical reception= World Village wrote that the game was \\"best suited as a tool to supplement African social studies\\", as many school children within the target age group would not have sufficiently learned about Africa at that point in their lives. AllGameGuide said the game \\"simulates the feel of a bike trip well,\\" but added \\"it is less adept at showing players the people of Africa. You may get a feel for the people and culture, but the information is really no more than a superficial glimpse.\\" Children's software reviewer Warren Buckleitner praised the game for its detail but felt it did not meet the quality of Oregon Trail II. H-Net felt it was far superior to The Oregon Trail. The Orlando Sentinel felt the game allowed players to test their critical thinking skills. The Boston Globe noted the game lets players explore the life of Africa.

Plot  The day he graduates high school, Bobby takes ownership of a tricked-out van that's like a bachelor pad on wheels. He's disappointed, however, to see that his best friend‚Äîwho has better luck with the ladies‚Äîmakes more use out of it than he does. He soon meets a shy girl and falls for her, but before he can win her heart, he has to win a drag race against a local bully. Production Production on The Van began on November 8, 1976, with locations in Moorpark, Whittier, Stanton, and Malibu, California. Legendary car customizer George Barris was commissioned to build two Dodge B300 extended-length Tradesman vans, with one being the primary picture car, and a backup that was used for all stunt driving scenes. An additional van, the antagonist's \\"Van Killer\\", was built by Barris as well, while the vans in the \\"van show\\" sequence were all various local Southern California customs. Soundtrack The music heard on the film's soundtrack is mainly material originally recorded for the small GRC Records label in Atlanta several years previously by Sammy Johns, most prominently his 1975 hit single \\"Chevy Van\\". The hit serves as the opening theme song, despite the glaring discrepancy of Bobby's van being a Dodge rather than a Chevrolet. Five of the Johns' recordings that appear (\\"Chevy Van\\", \\"Early Morning Love\\", \\"Jenny\\", \\"Rag Doll\\" and \\"Hang My Head and Moan\\") were originally recorded in 1973, for the GRC album Sammy Johns and appear in their 1975 remix versions from the second edition of that album. Five more songs (\\"Country Lady\\", \\"You're So Sweet\\", \\"Peas in a Pod\\", \\"Bless My Soul\\" and \\"Hey, Mr. Dreamer\\"), apparently dating from recording sessions for a follow-up GRC album, were used for both the film and soundtrack album. This follows a pattern Crown International had established in 1976, when the studio used Cotton, Lloyd & Christian, a 1975 album issued by 20th Century Records, as the source for all of the music in The Pom Pom Girls. In fact, the soundtrack album for The Van credits group member Michael Lloyd with \\"Musical Supervision\\" and the LP was released by Warner/Curb Records, in which Lloyd was an executive and producing chart hits by Shaun Cassidy and Debby Boone that same year. Critique The film shows stereotypical teenagers whose social lives revolve around getting high, drag racing and girls. The film features music from Sammy Johns (most notably the song Chevy Van), and is representative of its time. It exemplifies the free sex of an era before herpes and AIDS awareness, and celebrates the cultural tropes of the time, such as the heavily accessorized van that provides the film's title and the van's 8-track player. The film is an early example of a relatively new type of teen comedy, which featured sexual situations, nudity and substance abuse, very different from the Beach Party films of the early 1960s, with their no-nudity, drug-free plots. The Van was one of a set of four Crown International Pictures releases (the others being The Pom Pom Girls, Malibu Beach and Van Nuys Blvd.) that helped herald a form that would be exemplified by 1980 with The Hollywood Knights and later with the Porky's series. The film is referenced in every single episode of the Grindbin Podcast, a podcast dedicated to the discussion of exploitation films.http://www.grindhousefilm.com/ The Van was the subject of the very first episode. This led to a running gag where at the end of every subsequent episode, the hosts would imagine absurd scenarios wherein Bobby and Andy (DeVito's character) would cross over to the universe of whatever film they were discussing.

The game is an interactive movie spanning four CD-ROMs. The plot follows an American journalist in Paris who has been framed for murder during the course of an investigation. Urban Runner was not very popular at the time of its release, due to high graphics and monitor resolution requirements. The minimum requirement was 640√ó480, with 256 colors. For the best quality, 640√ó480, 32-bit color was needed. Few reviews have been published concerning the game. The lead is played by Brandon Massey, who also played the lead in the Sierra title Police Quest IV: Open Season (1993), making this his second and final appearance in a Sierra game. Plot You are Max Gardner (Brandon Massey), an American journalist in Paris, investigating a story about a big drug dealer who is covered by some influential politician. To get the dealer talking, you offer him incriminating photographs in exchange for some information. When Max arrives at the meeting point, the drug lord is dead and Max is mistaken for the killer. While evading the authorities, Max continues his investigation and finds an ally in Adda - the murdered drug dealer's lover - and the two of them work to uncover the conspiracy behind the murders. Gameplay The game itself is an interactive movie controlled with a mouse. As with many games of this type the player progresses by collecting items, talking to characters and solving puzzles. The player will also accumulate Clues - pieces of information which are essential to solving the mystery - which are separate from the inventory and cannot be given away or lost. Should the player be having difficulty in progressing, they begin the game with three Jokers to use, which act as a hint system. The player's viewpoint switches from Max to Adda at certain points in the game and sometimes gives the player a choice of which character to control. However, both characters must have the puzzles in their respective areas solved to progress. Gameplay can be divided into Clue and Action sections. Clue sections are puzzle-based with no time limit; players may have to explore an environment, talk to characters or interact with objects to progress. Action sections give the player a short amount of time to make a decision - making the wrong choice usually results in your character's death.  Compatibility  Urban Runner was developed to run under DOS and Windows 3.1, making it incompatible with modern Windows computers. However, it is fully playable using the game engine recreation software ScummVM, as part of its support for the Gob engine (which is used for games developed by Coktel Vision). Development According to the French newspaper Les √âchos, Urban Runner was created by a team of 50 people. By December 1995, it had been in development for one-and-a-half years and its budget had risen to 15 F million. Three months were spent on the game's live-action film shoots. Les √âchos reported that Urban Runners budget had climbed high enough that it would need to sell 500,000 units to break even.

He is best known for developing and championing the philosophy of radical probabilism and the associated heuristic of probability kinematics, also known as Jeffrey conditioning. Life and career Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Jeffrey served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. As a graduate student he studied under Rudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel. He received his M.A. from the University of Chicago in 1952 and his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1957. After holding academic positions at MIT, City College of New York, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania, he joined the faculty of Princeton in 1974 and became a professor emeritus there in 1999. He was also a visiting professor at the University of California, Irvine. Jeffrey, who died of lung cancer at the age of 76, was known for his sense of humor, which often came through in his breezy writing style. In the preface of his posthumously published Subjective Probability, he refers to himself as \\"a fond foolish old fart dying of a surfeit of Pall Malls\\".pxii Philosophical work As a philosopher, Jeffrey specialized in epistemology and decision theory. He is perhaps best known for defending and developing the Bayesian approach to probability. Jeffrey also wrote, or co-wrote, two widely used and influential logic textbooks: Formal Logic: Its Scope and Limits, a basic introduction to logic, and Computability and Logic, a more advanced text dealing with, among other things, the famous negative results of twentieth century logic such as G√∂del's incompleteness theorems and Tarski's indefinability theorem. =Radical probabilism= In frequentist statistics, Bayes' theorem provides a useful rule for updating a probability when new frequency data becomes available. In Bayesian statistics, the theorem itself plays a more limited role. Bayes' theorem connects probabilities that are held simultaneously. It does not tell the learner how to update probabilities when new evidence becomes available over time. This subtlety was first pointed out in terms by Ian Hacking in 1967. However, adapting Bayes' theorem, and adopting it as a rule of updating, is a temptation. Suppose that a learner forms probabilities Pold(A&B;)=p and Pold(B)=q. If the learner subsequently learns that B is true, nothing in the axioms of probability or the results derived therefrom tells him how to behave. He might be tempted to adopt Bayes' theorem by analogy and set his Pnew(A) = Pold(A  B) = p/q. In fact, that step, Bayes' rule of updating, can be justified, as necessary and sufficient, through a dynamic Dutch book argument that is additional to the arguments used to justify the axioms. This argument was first put forward by David Lewis in the 1970s though he never published it. That works when the new data is certain. C. I. Lewis had argued that \\"If anything is to be probable then something must be certain\\". There must, on Lewis' account, be some certain facts on which probabilities were conditioned. However, the principle known as Cromwell's rule declares that nothing, apart from a logical law, can ever be certain, if that. Jeffrey famously rejected Lewis' dictum and quipped, \\"It's probabilities all the way down.\\" He called this position radical probabilism. In this case Bayes' rule isn't able to capture a mere subjective change in the probability of some critical fact. The new evidence may not have been anticipated or even be capable of being articulated after the event. It seems reasonable, as a starting position, to adopt the law of total probability and extend it to updating in much the same way as was Bayes' theorem. : Pnew(A) = Pold(A  B)Pnew(B) + Pold(A  not-B)Pnew(not-B) Adopting such a rule is sufficient to avoid a Dutch book but not necessary.Skyrms (1987) Jeffrey advocated this as a rule of updating under radical probabilism and called it probability kinematics. Others have named it Jeffrey conditioning. It is not the only sufficient updating rule for radical probabilism. Others have been advocated including E. T. Jaynes' maximum entropy principle and Brian Skyrms' principle of reflection. Jeffrey conditioning can be generalized from partitions to arbitrary condition events by giving it a frequentist semantics.  Selected bibliography  * Formal Logic: Its Scope and Limits. 1st ed.

Iran, which was called Persia by the West before 1935, has had political relations with England since the late Ilkhanate period (13th century) when King Edward I of England sent Geoffrey of Langley to the Ilkhanid court to seek an alliance.Patrick Clawson. Eternal Iran. Palgrave 2005 , p.25 History of Anglo‚ÄìIranian relations =Safavid era= In the year 1553, King Edward VI of England hired the wealthy merchant and explorer, Sebastian Cabot to develop a semi-profitable trading company. He was given two ships that sailed towards the port city of Arkhangelsk. The captain of one of those ships was Cpt. Richard Chancellor, who successfully reached the northern city. From there, Sebastian Cabot and his envoy traveled towards the Russian city of Moscow with a business proposition for the Grand Duke Ivan IV the Terrible. When it was accepted, the Moscow Trading Company came into existence. South of the Moscow Trading Company Headquarters was the wealthy realm of the Safavid Empire. The company started sending envoys during the reign of Shah Tahmasp I during the first years in business. Anthony Jenkinson was one of the first leaders of these envoys. In total, there were six visits and the last one was in June 1579 during the reign of Shah Mohammad Khodabandeh led by Arthur Edwards. But at the time the company's envoys reached the royal court in Qazvin, the Shah was busy protecting his borders from his arch rival, the Ottoman Empire. In order to attain the wealth of the country, the company penetrated successfully into the bazaars and dispatched more envoys.Reader Bullard, Britain and the Middle East: From Earliest Times to 1963 (1964) pp 17-28. In 1597, as Abbas I of Safavid sought to establish an alliance against his arch rival, the Ottomans, he received Robert Shirley, Anthony Shirley, and a group of 26 English envoys in Qazvin. The English delegation, also well aware of the Ottoman threat, were more than glad to have Persia as an ally against the Ottoman threat. Shah Abbas warmly received the delegation and took them as his guests with him to Isfahan, his new capital. Soon, the Shirley brothers were appointed by the Shah to organize and modernize the royal cavalry and train the army (most notably the elite \\"Ghulam\\" slave soldiers, consisting of en masse deported and imported Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians and other Caucasians by the Shahs). The effects of these modernizations proved to be highly successful, as from then on the Safavids proved to be an equal force against their arch rival, immediately crushing them in the first war to come (Ottoman-Safavid War (1603-1618)) and all other Safavid wars to come. Many more events followed, including the debut of the British East India Company into Persia, and the establishment of trade routes for silk though Jask in the Strait of Hormuz in 1616. It was from here where the likes of Sir John Malcolm later gained influence into the Qajarid throne. =Qajar era= Nasereddin Shah of Persia is received by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in July 1859. Anglo-Persian relations picked up momentum as a weakened Safavid empire, after the short- lived revival by the military genius Nader Shah (r. 1736-1747), eventually gave way to the Qajarid dynasty, which was quickly absorbed into domestic turmoil and rivalry, while competing colonial powers rapidly sought a stable foothold in the region. While the Portuguese, British, and Dutch, competed for the south and southeast of Persia in the Persian Gulf, Imperial Russia was largely left unchallenged in the north as it plunged southward to establish dominance in Persia's northern territories.Bullard, Britain and the Middle East: From Earliest Times to 1963 (1964) pp 17-28. Plagued with internal politics and incompetence, the Qajarid government found itself fast after their ascendancy incapable of rising to the numerous complex foreign political challenges at the doorsteps of Persia. Caption from a 1911 English satirical magazine reads: \\"If we hadn't a thorough understanding, I (British lion) might almost be tempted to ask what you (Russian bear) are doing there with our little playfellow (Persian cat).\\" During the monarchy of Fath Ali Shah, Sir John Malcolm, Sir Harford Jones-Brydges, 1st Baronet, Allen Lindsay, Henry Pottinger, Charles Christie, Sir Henry Rawlinson, Harold Nicolson, Sir John McNeill, Edmund Ironside, and James Morier were some of the British elite closely involved with Persian politics. Allen Lindsay was even appointed as a general in Abbas Mirza's army. A weakened and bankrupted royal court under Fath Ali Shah was forced to sign the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, followed by the Treaty of Turkmenchay after efforts by Abbas Mirza failed to secure Persia's northern front against Imperial Russia. The treaties were prepared by the Sir Gore Ouseley with the aid of the British Foreign Office in London. Sir Gore Ouseley was the younger brother of the British orientalist William Ouseley, who served as secretary to the British ambassador in Persia. In fact, Iran's current southern and eastern boundaries were determined by none other than the British during the Anglo-Persian War (1856 to 1857). After repelling Nasereddin Shah's attack in Herat in 1857, the British government assigned Frederic John Goldsmid of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to determine the borders between Persia and India during the 1860s.Frederic John Goldsmid's Eastern Persia: An account of the journeys of the Persian Boundary Commission. 1870‚Äì1871‚Äì1872. London. Macmillan and Co. 1876. In 1872, the Shah signed an agreement with Baron Julius de Reuter, which George Nathaniel Curzon (who was one of the greatest statesmen of his day) called \\"The most complete and extraordinary surrender of the entire industrial resources of a kingdom into foreign hands that has ever been dreamed of\\".Persia and the Persian Question, Vol.I London. Frank Cass and Co. Ltd. 1966. p.480 The Reuter Concession was immediately denounced by all ranks of businessmen, clergy, and nationalists of Persia, and the concession was quickly forced into cancellation.Galbraith, John S. \\"British policy on railways in Persia, 1870‚Äì1900.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 25.4 (1989): 480-505. Similarly, the \\"Tobacco fatwa\\", decreed by Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi was an incident which raised popular resentment against the British presence in Persia in lieu of a diplomatically decapitated and apathetic Qajar throne. Concessions such as this and the 70-year contract of Persian railways to be operated by British businessmen such as Baron de Reuter became increasingly visible. The visibility became particularly pronounced after the discovery of oil in Masjed Soleiman in 1909 and the establishment of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the \\"D'Arcy Concession\\". By the end of the 19th century, Britain's dominance became so pronounced that Khuzestan, Bushehr, and a host of other cities in southern Persia were occupied by Great Britain, and the central government in Tehran was left with no power to even select its own ministers without the approval of the Anglo- Russian consulates. Morgan Shuster, for example, had to resign under tremendous British and Russian pressure on the royal court. Shuster's book The Strangling of Persia is a recount of the details of these events, a harsh criticism of Britain and Imperial Russia. =Pahlavi era= Of the public outcry against the inability of the Persian throne to maintain its political and economic independence from Great Britain and Imperial Russia in the face of events such as the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 and \\"the 1919 treaty\\", one result was the Persian Constitutional Revolution, which eventually resulted in the fall of the Qajar dynasty. The great tremor of the Persian political landscape occurred when the involvement of General Edmund Ironside eventually led to the rise of Reza Shah Pahlavi in the 1920s. The popular view that the British were involved in the 1921 coup was noted as early as March 1921 by the American embassy and relayed to the Iran desk at the Foreign Office.Zirinsky M.P. \\"Imperial Power and Dictatorship: Britain and the Rise of Reza Shah 1921‚Äì1926\\". International Journal of Middle East Studies. 24, 1992. p. 646. A British Embassy report from 1932 concedes that the British put Reza Shah \\"on the throne\\".Sources: * FO 371 16077 E2844 dated 8 June 1932. * The Memoirs of Anthony Eden are also explicit about Britain's role in putting RezƒÅ Khan in power. * Ansari, Ali M. Modern Iran since 1921. Longman. 2003 pp. 26‚Äì31. After his establishing of power and strengthening of the central government, RezƒÅ Khan quickly put an end to the autonomous activities of the British-backed Sheikh Khazal in the south. London withdrew its support of Khaz'al in favor of RezƒÅ ShƒÅh. However, RezƒÅ ShƒÅh was removed from power just as quickly during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran during World War II. A novel chapter in Anglo-Iranian relations had begun when Iran canceled its capitulation agreements with foreign powers in 1928. Iran's success in revoking the capitulation treaties, and the failure of the Anglo-Iranian Agreement of 1919 earlier, led to intense diplomatic efforts by the British government to regularize relations between the two countries on a treaty basis. On the Iranian side negotiations on the widest range of issues were conducted by Abdolhossein Teymourtash, the Minister of Court from 1925 to 1932, and Iran's nominal Minister of Foreign Affairs during the period. The ire of the British Government was raised, however, by Persian diplomatic claims to the oil-rich regions of the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands, Abu Musa and Bahrain in the Persian Gulf region. On the economic front, on the other hand, Iran's pressures to rescind the monopoly rights of the British- owned Imperial Bank of Persia to issue banknotes in Iran, the Iranian Trade Monopoly Law of 1928, and prohibitions whereby the British Government and Anglo-Persian Oil Company (\\"APOC\\") were no longer permitted to enter into direct agreements with their client tribes, as had been the case in the past, did little to satisfy British expectations. The cumulative impact of these demands on the British Government was well expressed by Sir Robert Clive, Britain's Minister to Tehran, who in 1931 noted in a report to the Foreign Office \\"There are indications, indeed that their present policy is to see how far they can push us in the way of concessions, and I feel we shall never re- establish our waning prestige or even be able to treat the Persian government on equal terms, until we are in a position to call a halt\\". Despite the enormous volume of correspondence and protracted negotiations that took place between the two countries on the widest array of issues, on the Iranian side, Teymourtash conducted these negotiations single-handedly ‚Äúwithout so much as a secretary to keep his papers in order‚Äù, according to one scholar. Resolution of all outstanding differences eluded a speedy resolution, however, given the reality that on the British side progress proved tedious due to the need to consult many government departments with differing interests and jurisdictions. The most intractable challenge, however, proved to be Iran's assiduous efforts to revise the terms whereby the APOC retained near monopoly control over the oil industry in Iran as a result of the concession granted to William Knox D'Arcy in 1901 by the Qajar King of the period. \\"What Persians felt\\", Teymourtash would explain to his British counterparts in 1928, \\"was that an industry had been developed on their own soil in which they had no real share\\". Complicating matters further, and ensuring that such demands would in due course set Iran on a collision course with the British Government was the reality that pursuant to a 1914 Act of the British Parliament, an initiative championed by Winston Churchill in his capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty, led the British Government to be granted a majority fifty-three percent ownership of the shares of APOC. The decision was adopted during World War I to ensure the British Government would gain a critical foothold in Iranian affairs so as to protect the flow of oil from Iran due to its critical importance to the operation of the Royal Navy during the war effort. By the 1920s APOC's extensive installations and pipelines in Khuzestan and its refinery in Abadan meant that the company's operations in Iran had led to the creation of the greatest industrial complex in the Middle East. The attempt to revise the terms of the oil concession on a more favorable basis for Iran led to protracted negotiations that took place in Tehran, Lausanne, London and Paris between Teymourtash and the Chairman of APOC, Sir John Cadman, spanning the years from 1928 to 1932. The overarching argument for revisiting the terms of the D'Arcy Agreement on the Iranian side was that its national wealth was being squandered by a concession that was granted in 1901 by a previous non- constitutional government forced to agree to inequitable terms under duress. However, despite much progress, RezƒÅ ShƒÅh Pahlavi was soon to assert his authority by dramatically inserting himself into the negotiations. The Monarch attended a meeting of the Council of Ministers in November 1932, and after publicly rebuking Teymourtash for his failure to secure an agreement, dictated a letter to cabinet canceling the D'Arcy Agreement. The Iranian Government notified APOC that it would cease further negotiations and demanded cancellation of the D'Arcy concession. Rejecting the cancellation, the British government espoused the claim on behalf of APOC and brought the dispute before the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, asserting that it regarded itself \\"as entitled to take all such measures as the situation may demand for the Company's protection.\\" At this point, Hassan Taqizadeh, the new Iranian minister to have been entrusted the task of assuming responsibility for the oil dossier, was to intimate to the British that the cancellation was simply meant to expedite negotiations and that it would constitute political suicide for Iran to withdraw from negotiations. In 1951, the Iranians nationalized the oil under the leadership of democratically elected prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. This caused a lot of tension between Iran and the UK. According to the book All the Shah's Men, the British tried to convince Harry S. Truman to join their campaign against Iran. However, it was only when Dwight Eisenhower became the president that British succeeded in convincing U.S. to join their plot. In order to convince the Eisenhower administration Woodhouse shaped his appeal around the rhetoric of anti-communism. They pointed out the Tudeh party could take control of Iran. Eventually British and CIA created a plan code-named Operation Ajax to overthrow the democratically elected Mosaddegh. The coup was performed by Central Intelligence Agency field commander Kermit Roosevelt, Jr. (grandson of Theodore Roosevelt). The Shah of Iran saluting Winston Churchill on the occasion of Churchill's 69th birthday at the close of the Tripartite Conference of Tehran November 1943. On the far left is Ali Soheili, serving his second term as Prime Minister of Iran. After the coup, scores of Iranian political activists from the National and Communist parties were jailed or killed. This coup only added to the deep mistrust towards the British in Iran. It has since been very common in Iranian culture to mistrust British government; a good example is the character of Uncle in the television show My Uncle Napoleon. The end of World War II brought the start of American dominance in Iran's political arena, and with an anti-Soviet Cold War brewing, the United States quickly moved to convert Iran into an anti-communist bloc, thus considerably diminishing Britain's influence on Iran for years to come. Operation Ajax and the fall of Prime Minister Mosaddegh was perhaps the last of the large British involvements in Iranian politics in the Pahlavi era. HIM the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi paid a state visit to the United Kingdom in May 1959. HM Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom paid a state visit to Iran in March 1961. The British forces began to withdraw from the Gulf in 1968. This was done, quite literally, out of pure economic considerations. The British simply could not afford the costs of administration. (See also East of Suez). As part of this policy, in 1971, the then British government decided not to support the Shah and eventually, the patronage of the United Kingdom ended, and consequently, this role was filled by the US. =The Islamic Republic= The Iranian embassy in London seen here damaged by fire in May 1980 as a result of the Iranian Embassy siege. On 30 April 1980, the Iranian Embassy in London was taken over by a six-man terrorist team holding the building for six days until the hostages were rescued by a raid by the SAS. After the Revolution of Iran in 1979, Britain suspended all diplomatic relations with Iran. Britain did not have an embassy until it was reopened in 1988. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Saddam Hussein acquired metal tubes from firms in the United Kingdom, intended for the Project Babylon supergun. All were intercepted by customs and excise and none ever reached Iraq. The suppliers were under the impression that their tubes would have been used in a pipeline project. A year after the re- establishment of the British embassy in Tehran, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa ordering Muslims across the world to kill British author Salman Rushdie. Diplomatic ties with London were broken off only to be resumed at a charg√© d'affaires level in 1990. Relations normalized in 1997 during President Mohammad Khatami's reformist administration, and Jack Straw became the first high-ranking British politician to visit Tehran in 2001 since the revolution. Relations suffered a setback in 2002 when David Reddaway was rejected by Tehran as London's ambassador, on charges of being a spy, and further deteriorated two years later when Iran seized eight British sailors in Arvand River near the border with Iraq. The sailors were pardoned and attended a goodbye ceremony with President Ahmadinejad shortly after they were released. In February 2004, following the earthquake in Bam, Prince Charles and then President Mohammad Khatami visited the city. On 28 November 2011 Iran downgraded its relations with Britain due to new sanctions put in place by the UK. The next day a band of students and Basiji attacked the UK embassy compound in Tehran, damaging property and driving the embassy staff away. On 30 November 2011, in response to the attack, the UK closed its embassy in Tehran and ordered the Iranian embassy in London closed. According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, only 5% of British people view Iran's influence positively, with 84% expressing a negative view.2013 World Service Poll BBC News According to a 2012 Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 16% of British people viewed Iran favorably, compared to 68% which viewed it unfavorably; 91% of British people oppose Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons and 79% approve of \\"tougher sanctions\\" on Iran, while 51% of British people support use of military force to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.A Global ‚ÄúNo‚Äù To a Nuclear-Armed Iran Pew Research Center From July 2012 until October 2013, British interests in Iran were maintained by the Swedish embassy in Tehran while Iranian interests in the United Kingdom were maintained by the Omani embassy in London. On July 2013, it was announced that the UK would consider opening better relations with Iran \\"step-by-step\\" following the election of President Hassan Rouhani. On October 8, 2013, Britain and Iran announced that they would each appoint a charg√© d'affaires to work toward resuming full diplomatic relations. On February 20, 2014, the Iranian Embassy in London was restored and the two countries agreed to restart diplomatic relations. On August 23, 2015, the British Embassy in Tehran officially reopened. Current relations =Trade= The first Persian Ambassador to The United Kingdom was Mirza Albohassan Khan Ilchi Kabir. The Iranian Embassy in London The British Embassy in Tehran The Herald Tribune on 22 January 2006 reported a rise in British exports to Iran from ¬£296 million in 2000 to ¬£443.8 million in 2004. A spokesperson for UK Trade and Investment was quoted saying that \\"Iran has become more attractive because it now pursues a more liberal economic policy\\". As of 2009, the total assets frozen in Britain under the EU (European Union) and UN sanctions against Iran are approximately ¬£976m ($1.64 billion).\\"Over $1.6 bn of Iranian assets frozen in Britain\\", PressTV.com, June 18, 2009 In November 2011, Britain severed all ties with Iranian banks as part of a package of sanctions from the US, UK and Canada aimed at confronting Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme.http://www.turquoisepartners.com/iraninvestment/IIM- Dec11.pdf =Political tension= The confrontation between the United States‚ÄìEuropean Union pact on one side and Iran on the other over Iran's nuclear program also continues to develop, remaining a serious obstacle in the improvement of Tehran‚ÄìLondon ties. A confidential letter by UK diplomat John Sawers to French, German and US diplomats, dated 16 March 2006, twice referred to the intention to have the United Nations Security Council refer to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in order to put pressure on Iran. Chapter VII describes the Security Council's power to authorize economic, diplomatic, and military sanctions, as well as the use of military force, to resolve disputes. The Sunday Telegraph reported that a secret, high-level meeting would take place on 3 April 2006 between the UK government and military chiefs regarding plans to attack Iran.Government in secret talks about strike against Iran, Sean Rayment, Sunday Telegraph, 2 April 2006 The Telegraph cited \\"a senior Foreign Office source\\" saying that \\"The belief in some areas of Whitehall is that an attack is now all but inevitable. There will be no invasion of Iran but the nuclear sites will be destroyed.\\" The BBC reported a denial that the meeting would take place, but no denial of the alleged themes of the meeting, by the UK Ministry of Defence, and that \\"there is well sourced and persistent speculation that American covert activities aimed at Iran are already underway\\".MoD denies Iran military meeting, BBC, 2 April 2006 2004 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel On 21 June 2004, eight sailors and Royal Marines were seized by forces of the Revolutionary Guards' Navy while training Iraqi river patrol personnel in the Persian Gulf. 2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel On 23 March 2007 fifteen Royal Navy personnel were seized by the naval forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard for allegedly having strayed into Iranian waters. Eight sailors and seven Royal Marines on two boats from HMS Cornwall were detained at 10:30 local time by six Guard boats of the IRGC Navy. They were subsequently taken to Tehran. Iran reported that the sailors are well. About 200 students targeted the British Embassy on 1 April 2007 calling for the expulsion of the country's ambassador because of the standoff over Iran's capture of 15 British sailors and marines. The protesters chanted \\"Death to Britain\\" and \\"Death to America\\".Protest in Iran targets British Embassy, China Daily, 1 April 2007 Speculation on the Iranians' motivations for this action ran rampant; with the Iranians under tremendous pressure on a number of fronts from the United States, the Revolutionary Guard Corps could have been responding to any one of a number of perceived threats. On 3 April 2007, Prime Minister Tony Blair advised that \\"the next 48 hours will be critical\\" in defusing the crisis. At approximately 1:20 PM GMT, Iran's president announced that the 8 sailors would be 'pardoned'. The following day, he announced all 15 British personnel would be released immediately \\"in celebration of the Prophet's birthday and Easter.\\" Arms sales Despite the political pressure and sanctions, a probe by customs officers suggests that at least seven British arms dealers have been supplying the Iranian air force, its elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the country's controversial nuclear ambitions. A UK businessman was caught smuggling components for use in guided missiles through a front company that proved to be the Iranian Ministry of Defence. Another case involves a group that included several Britons which, investigators alleged, attempted to export components intended to enhance the performance of Iranian aircraft. Other examples involve a British millionaire arms dealer caught trading machine-guns used by the SAS and capable of firing 800 rounds a minute with a Tehran-based weapons supplier. Gholhak Garden In 2006 a dispute about the ownership of Gholhak Garden, a large British diplomatic compound in northern Tehran was raised in the Iranian Parliament when 162 MPs wrote to the speaker. The British Embassy have occupied the site since at least 1934 and assert that they have legal ownership but the issue was raised again in 2007 when a group of MPs claimed that the ownership papers for the site were unlawful under the laws extant in 1934.ÿßŸÅÿ≤ÿß€åÿ¥ ÿ™ŸÑÿßÿ¥ Ÿáÿß ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ÿ®ÿßÿ≤Ÿæÿ≥ ⁄Ø€åÿ±€å ÿ®ÿßÿ∫ ŸÇŸÑŸá⁄©. BBC Persian. January 21, 2007 In July 2007 a conference was held to discuss the ownership of the compound but was not attended by the British side. =Asylum= On 14 March 2008, Britain said it would reconsider the asylum application of a gay Iranian teenager who claims he will be persecuted if he is returned home. He had fled to the Netherlands and sought asylum there; however, the Dutch government turned him down, saying the case should be dealt with in Britain, where he first applied. =Escalating war talk= As talk of strikes and counter-strikes in relation to war talk between the United States-Israel-Iran trio heated up in 2008, a senior Iranian official suggested his regime should target London to deter such an attack. The head of the Europe and US Department in the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Wahid Karimi, said an attack on London could deter the US from attacking Tehran. He said: \\"The most appropriate means of deterrence that Iran has, in addition to a retaliatory operation in the [Persian Gulf] region, is to take action against London.\\" He also suggested a propensity to attack could arise from a \\"usually adventuresome\\" second term presidency. He said: \\"US presidents are usually adventuresome in their second terms... [Richard] Nixon, disgraced by the Watergate scandal; [Ronald] Reagan, with the 'Irangate' adventure; [and Bill] Clinton, with Monica Lewinsky‚Äîand perhaps George Bush, the sitting president, will create a scandal connected to Iran's legitimate nuclear activity so as not to be left behind.\\" His speculation led him to suggest a clash could occur between the 2008 U.S. presidential elections and by the time the new president enters office in January 2009. \\"In the worst-case scenario, George Bush may perhaps persuade the president-elect to carry out an ill-conceived operation against Iran, prior to January 20, 2009‚Äîthat is, before the regime is handed over and he ends his presence in the White House. The next president of the US will have to deal with the consequences.\\" =2009 Iranian election controversy= In the aftermath of the disputed 2009 Iranian presidential election and the protests that followed, UK-Iran relations were further tested. On 19 June 2009, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei described the British Government as the \\"most evil\\" of those in the Western nations, accusing the British government of sending spies into Iran to stir emotions at the time of the elections, although it has been suggested by British diplomats that the statement was using the UK as a \\"proxy\\" for the United States, in order to prevent damaging US‚ÄìIranian relations. Nonetheless, the British Government, unhappy at the statement, summoned the Iranian ambassador Rasul Movaheddian to the Foreign Office to lodge a protest. Iran then proceeded to expel two British diplomats from the country, accusing them of \\"activities inconsistent with their diplomatic status\\". On 23 June 2009, the British Government responded, expelling two Iranian diplomats from the United Kingdom. Prime Minister Gordon Brown stated that he was unhappy at having to take the action, but suggested there was no option after what he described as 'unjustified' actions by Iran. On 24 June 2009, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki announced that the country was considering 'downgrading' its ties with the UK. Four days later it was reported that Iranian authorities had arrested a number of British embassy staff in Tehran citing their \\"considerable role\\" in the recent unrest. After this event, the UK Government responded strongly demanding that the Iranian authorities release the British staff immediately as it stated that Iran's accusations are baseless without evidence. After the arrest of UK staff, the European Union (EU) has also demanded that UK staff be released in Iran under international law and if the UK staff are not released then the EU threatens a 'strong response'. On December 29, 2009, Britain was warned by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki to state \\"Britain will get slapped in the mouth if it does not stop its nonsense.\\" The Queen's College, Oxford established the Neda Agha-Soltan Graduate Scholarship in 2009, named after Neda Agha-Soltan, who died in the protests that followed the election. This led to a letter of protest to the college from the Iranian embassy in London, signed by the deputy ambassador, Safarali Eslamian. The letter disputed the circumstances of her death, and said that there was \\"supporting evidence indicating a pre-made scenario\\". Eslamain wrote, \\"It seems that the University of Oxford has stepped up involvement in a politically motivated campaign which is not only in sharp contract with its academic objectives, but also is linked with a chain of events in post-Iranian presidential elections blamed for British interference both at home and abroad\\". The letter also said that the \\"decision to abuse Neda's case to establish a graduate scholarship will highly politicise your academic institution, undermining your scientific credibility‚Äîalong with British press which made exceptionally a lot of hue and cry on Neda's death‚Äîwill make Oxford at odd with the rest of the world's academic institutions.\\" Eslamain asked for the university's governing board to be informed of \\"the Iranian views\\", and finished by saying, \\"Surely, your steps to achieve your attractions through non-politically supported programs can better heal the wounds of her family and her nation.\\" Following publication of the Iranian letter, The Times was told by UK diplomatic sources, speaking anonymously, that the scholarship had put \\"another nail into the coffin\\" of relations between Britain and Iran. If the government had been asked, the sources were reported as saying, it would have advised against the move, because it was felt that Iran would see it as an act of provocation, and because it would interfere with efforts to free Iranians working for the British Embassy in Tehran who had been detained for alleging participating in the post-election protests. A college spokesman said that the scholarship had not been set up as part of a political decision, and if the initial donations had been refused, this would have been interpreted as a political decision too. =2009 international arbitration court ruling= In April 2009 the British government lost its final appeal in the arbitration court of the International Chamber of Commerce at The Hague against a payment of $650 million to Iran. The money is compensation for an arms deal dating from the 1970s which then did not come about due to the occurrence of the Iranian Revolution. The Shah's government had ordered 1,500 Chieftain tanks and 250 Chieftain armoured recovery vehicles (ARVs) in a contract worth ¬£650 million, but only 185 vehicles had been delivered before the revolution occurred. The contract also covered the provision of training to the Iranian army and the construction of a factory near Isfahan to build tank parts and ammunition. In order to recover some of the costs 279 of the Chieftains were sold to Jordan and 29 of the ARVs to Iraq, who used them against Iran in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The UK continued to deliver tank parts to Iran after the revolution but finally stopped following the outbreak of the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979. The British government has itself confirmed it has to pay the money and the ruling, which originated in The Hague, received coverage in The Independent. Britain had already placed ¬£486 million with the court in 2002 to pay for any ruling against it. The settlement is worth ¬£390 million that will come out of this fund. Iran has yet to officially apply to receive the money but when it does so will not receive it, instead it will join ¬£976 million of Iranian assets frozen by the UK due to EU sanctions. =2011 attack on the British Embassy= On 29 November 2011, despite heavy police resistance, two compounds of the British embassy in Tehran were stormed by Iranian protesters. The protesters smashed windows, ransacked offices, set fire to government documents, and burned a British flag. Six British diplomats were initially reported by the Iranian semi-official news agency Mehr as being taken hostage, while later reports indicated that in fact they were escorted to safety by the police. The storming of the British embassy followed from the 2011 joint American-British-Canadian sanctions and the Iranian government's Guardian Council approving a parliamentary bill expelling the British ambassador as a result of those sanctions. A British flag was taken down and replaced by the Iranian flag by the protesters. The British Foreign Office responded by saying \\"We are outraged by this. It is utterly unacceptable and we condemn it.\\" According to Iranian state news agencies, the protesters were largely composed of young adults. On 30 November William Hague announced that all Iranian diplomats had been expelled and given 48 hours to leave the United Kingdom. =Since 2011= The UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned that Britain might take military action against Iran if it carries out its threat to block the Strait of Hormuz. He said any attempt by Iran to block the strategically important waterway in retaliation for sanctions against its oil exports would be ‚Äúillegal and unsuccessful‚Äù and the Royal Navy would join any action to keep it open. British defence officials met US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta on 6 January to criticize other members of the NATO for not being willing to commit resources to joint operations, including in Libya and Afghanistan.U.K. Warns Iran Over ‚ÄòIllegal‚Äô Threat to Close Strait of Hormuz Business Week, 5 January 2012Imperial Overdrive: Red alert over Iran RT NewsBritain and US to scale down military capability due to debt crisis The Guardian, 5 January 2012 The following day, UK officials reported its intention to send its most powerful naval forces to the Persian Gulf to counter any Iranian attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz.

This was done on 20 February 2014, and the British government announced in June 2014 that it would soon re-open its Tehran embassy. Embassies in each other's countries were simultaneously reopened in 2015. The ceremony in Tehran was attended by UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, the first British Foreign Secretary to visit Iran since Jack Straw in 2003, who attended the reopening of the Iranian embassy in London, along with Iran's deputy foreign minister Mehdi Danesh Yazdi. Diplomat Ajay Sharma was named as the UK's charge d'affaires but a full ambassador was expected to be appointed in the coming months. In September 2016, both countries restored diplomatic relations to their pre-2011 level, with Nicholas Hopton being appointed British Ambassador in Tehran.UK appoints first ambassador to Iran in five years, BBC News (5 September 2016). Retrieved 6 September 2016. British Prime Minister David Cameron and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani met on the sidelines of a United Nations in September 2014, marking the highest-level direct contact between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

The British intelligence officials concluded that Iran was responsible for a cyberattack on the British Parliament lasting 12 hours that compromised around 90 email accounts of MPs in June 2017. =Tanker detention and Strait of Hormuz tensions= According to the British Royal Navy, , seen here in 2005, foiled an attempted Iranian seizure of a British oil tanker while transiting through the Strait of Hormuz in July 2019. On 4 July 2019, Royal Marines boarded the Iranian-owned tanker Grace 1 by helicopter off Gibraltar where it was detained. The reason given was to enforce European Union sanctions against Syrian entities, as the tanker was suspected of heading to Baniyas Refinery named in the sanctions that concern Syrian oil exports. Gibraltar had passed regulations permitting the detention the day before. Spain's Foreign Minister Josep Borrell stated that the detention was carried out at the request of the United States. An Iranian Foreign Ministry official calling the seizure \\"piracy,\\" stating that the UK does not have the right to implement sanctions against other nations \\"in an extraterritorial manner\\". On 10 July 2019, tensions were raised further when boats belonging to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached a British Petroleum tanker, British Heritage, impeding it while it was transiting the Strait of Hormuz. The Royal Navy frigate positioned themselves between the boats and ship so that it could continue its journey. On 14 July 2019, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Grace 1 could be released if the UK received guarantees the oil ‚Äî 2.1 million barrels worth ‚Äî would not go to Syria. NEDSA soldiers On 19 July 2019, Iran media reported that the Swedish owned but British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero had been seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Strait of Hormuz. A first tanker, MV Mesdar, which was a Liberian-flagged vessel managed in the UK, jointly Algerian and Japanese owned, was boarded but later released. Iran stated that the British-flagged ship had collided with and damaged an Iranian vessel, and had ignored warnings by Iranian authorities. During the incident HMS Montrose was stationed too far away to offer timely assistance; when the Type 23 frigate arrived it was ten minutes too late. HMS Montrose was slated to be replaced by , however in light of events it was decided that both ships would subsequently be deployed together. On 15 August 2019 Gibraltar released Grace 1 after stating that it had received assurances she would not go to Syria. The Iranian government later stated that it had issued no assurances that the oil would not be delivered to Syria and reasserted its intention to continue supplying oil to the Arab nation. On 26 August, Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei announced that the 2.1 million barrels of crude had been sold to an unnamed buyer, in either Kalamata, Greece or Mersin, Turkey. A US court issued a warrant of seizure against the tanker because it was convinced that the tanker was owned by the IRGC, which is deemed by Washington a foreign terrorist organization. On 15 August 2019 the UK's new Boris Johnson-led government agreed to join the U.S. in its Persian Gulf maritime security Operation Sentinel, abandoning the idea of a European-led naval protection force. On 4 September 2019 Iran released seven of the 23 crew members of the British- flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, which the Iranian forces had detained in August. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi stated that they have been released on humanitarian grounds. He said that their problem was the violation committed by the ship. On 23 September, the Iranian authorities announced that the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero, which they had captured on July 19 in the Strait of Hormuz, was free to leave. According to the government spokesperson Ali Rabiei informed that the legal process concluded and all the conditions to let the oil tanker go were also fulfilled. However, on September 24, it was reported that despite raising a green signal for the British tanker to leave the port, it remained in Iran waters. Swedish owner of Stena Impero, Erik Hanell said that they had no idea why the tanker was still there. On 27 September, the Stena Impero departed from Iranian waters and made its way to Port Rashid in Dubai. All of the remaining crew members who were still detained by Iran were released as well.

Iran threatened the United States with severe revenge. As the United Kingdom is usually seen as a major ally of the United States, the Foreign Office and Foreign Minister (UK) put out a statement urging deescalation and stating that a war is in no-one's interests.

It is found in the blood serum of more complex animals. Structure Properdin is a gamma globulin protein composed of multiple identical protein subunits with a separate ligand-binding site. Native properdin occurs in head-to-tail dimers, trimers and tetramers in the fixed ratio 22:52:28. Function It is known that it participates in some specific immune responses. It plays a part in tissue inflammation as well as the engulfing of pathogens by phagocytes. In addition it is known to help to neutralize some viruses. The properdin promotes the association of C3b with Factor B and provides a focal point for the assembly of C3bBb on a surface. It binds to preformed alternative pathway C3-convertases. Properdin also inhibits the Factor H ‚Äì mediated cleavage of C3b by Factor I. Alternative pathway. Properdin is the \\"P\\" in the blue circles. (Some labels are in Polish.) The alternative pathway is not dependent on antibodies. This branch of the complement system is activated by IgA immune complexes and bacterial endotoxins, polysaccharides, and cell walls, and results in producing anaphylatoxins, opsonins, chemotactic factors, and the membrane attack complex, all of which help fight pathogens. History Properdin was discovered in 1954 by Dr. Louis Pillemer of the Institute of Pathology (now the Department of Pathology at Case Western Reserve University).

These lower motor neurons innervate the muscles of facial expression and the stapedius. Structure The nucleus is situated in the caudal portion of the ventrolateral pontine tegmentum. Its axons take an unusual course, traveling dorsally and looping around the abducens nucleus, then traveling ventrally to exit the ventral pons medial to the spinal trigeminal nucleus. These axons form the motor component of the facial nerve, with parasympathetic and sensory components forming the intermediate nerve. The nucleus has a dorsal and ventral region, with neurons in the dorsal region innervating muscles of the upper face and neurons in the ventral region innervating muscles of the lower face. Function Because it innervates muscles derived from pharyngeal arches, the facial motor nucleus is considered part of the special visceral efferent (SVE) cell column, which also includes the trigeminal motor nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, and (arguably) the spinal accessory nucleus. =Cortical input= Like all lower motor neurons, cells of the facial motor nucleus receive cortical input from the primary motor cortex in the frontal lobe of the brain. Upper motor neurons of the cortex send axons that descend through the internal capsule and synapse on neurons in the facial motor nucleus. This pathway from the cortex to the brainstem is called the corticobulbar tract. The neurons in the dorsal aspect of the facial motor nucleus receive inputs from both sides of the cortex, while those in the ventral aspect mainly receive contralateral inputs (i.e. from the opposite side of the cortex). The result is that both sides of the brain control the muscles of the upper face, while the right side of the brain controls the lower left side of the face, and the left side of the brain controls the lower right side of the face. Clinical significance As a result of the corticobulbar input to the facial motor nucleus, an upper motor neuron lesion to fibers innervating the facial motor nucleus results in central seven. The syndrome is characterized by spastic paralysis of the contralateral lower face. For example, a left corticobulbar lesion results in paralysis of the muscles that control the lower right quadrant of the face. By contrast, a lower motor neuron lesion to the facial motor nucleus results in paralysis of facial muscles on the same side of the injury. If a cause, such as trauma or infection, cannot be identified (this situation is called idiopathic palsy) this condition is known as Bell's palsy. Otherwise it is described by its cause. =Mechanism of Facial Nerve Upper vs Lower Motor Neuron Lesions= Any lesion occurring within or affecting the corticobulbar tract is known as an upper motor neuron lesion. Any lesion affecting the individual branches (temporal, zygomatic, buccal, mandibular and cervical) is known as a lower motor neuron lesion. Branches of the facial nerve leaving the facial motor nucleus (FMN) for the muscles do so via both left and right posterior (dorsal) and anterior (ventral) routes. In other words, this means lower motor neurons of the facial nerve can leave either from the left anterior, left posterior, right anterior or right posterior facial motor nucleus. The temporal branch travels out from the left and right posterior components. The inferior four branches do so via the left and right anterior components. The left and right branches supply their respective sides of the face (ipsilateral innervation). Accordingly, the posterior components receive motor input from both hemispheres of the cerebral cortex (bilaterally), whereas the anterior components receive strictly contralateral input. This means that the temporal branch of the facial nerve receives motor input from both hemispheres of the cerebral cortex whereas the zygomatic, buccal, mandibular and cervical branches receive information from only contralateral hemispheres. Now, because the anterior FMN receives only contralateral cortical input whereas the posterior receives that which is bilateral, a corticobulbar lesion (UMN lesion) occurring in the left hemisphere would eliminate motor input to the right anterior FMN component, thus removing signaling to the inferior four facial nerve branches, thereby paralyzing the right mid- and lower-face. The posterior component, however, although now only receiving input from the right hemisphere, is still able to allow the temporal branch to sufficiently innervate the entire forehead. This means that the forehead will not be paralyzed. The same mechanism applies for an upper motor neuron lesion in the right hemisphere. The left anterior FMN component no longer receives cortical motor input due to its strict contralateral innervation, whereas the posterior component is still sufficiently supplied by the left hemisphere. The result is paralysis of the left mid- and lower-face with an unaffected forehead. On the other hand, a lower motor neuron lesion is a bit different. A lesion on either the left or right side would affect both the anterior and posterior routes on that side because of their close physical proximity to one another. So, a lesion on the left side would inhibit muscle innervation from both the left posterior and anterior routes, thus paralyzing the whole left side of the face (Bell‚Äôs palsy). With this type of lesion, the bilateral and contralateral inputs of the posterior and anterior routes, respectively, become irrelevant because the lesion is below the level of the medulla and the facial motor nucleus. Whereas at a level above the medulla a lesion occurring in one hemisphere would mean that the other hemisphere could still sufficiently innervate the posterior facial motor nucleus, a lesion affecting a lower motor neuron would eliminate innervation altogether because the nerves no longer have a means to receive compensatory contralateral input at a downstream decussation. Thus, the main distinction between an UMN and LMN lesion is that in the former, there is hemiplegia of the contralateral mid- and lower-face, whereas in the latter, there is complete hemiplegia of the ipsilateral face.

Greenside borders on the suburbs Emmarentia, Parkview, Parkhurst and Victory Park. History Greenside lies on land that once made up the Braamfontein Farm, one of many large farms that makes what is Johannesburg and its suburbs. The farm land was bought in 1886 by Lourens Geldenhuys for its mining rights as it was hoped that the Confidence Reef would extend into his farm but it did not. Land remained as a farm and by 1891 it was divided, along what is now Orange Road, between his son's Frans and Louw where the brothers had already built two farm houses. Louw Geldenhuys died in 1929 and his wife Emmarentia would begin to sell parts of the farm that became the surrounding suburbs, one of which became Greenside on 4 February 1931 and was surveyed by the Rand Mines Group. Greenside's name is considered to be Scottish in origin, and refers to the adjacent Parkview Golf Club. The golf course has its origins much earlier than the suburb, established in 1916 and modified again in 1930. Most of the roads in Greenside were named after golf courses or professional golfers. Leitch Road was named after the Scottish golfer Charlotte Cecilia Pitcairn Leitch. Quimet Street is named after the America golfer Francis Ouimet - how the confusion arose between the O and the Q is not known - suffice to say that it causes never-ending confusion as to the pronunciation of the street name (should it be pronounced in the French or American style), and for people seeking to locate the street. By 1940, Greenside Primary School had been established and Greenside High School would follow in January 1961. Pirates Sports & Rugby Club was based in the suburb from 1952 on land donated to the City of Johannesburg by the Sir Lionel Phillips Trust based inside the Sir Lionel Phillips Park, though the club originated elsewhere in 1888.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town west of Albury, and is situated on the Murray River which separates the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria. The town is located on the Riverina Highway. There is a bridge across the Murray into Victoria. Howlong is in the Federation Council local government area. At the , Howlong had a population of 2,551. History Prior to the founding of the township the Surveyor-General of New South Wales at that time Major Thomas Mitchell crossed the Murray River during his exploration of the area. There is a monument to Mitchell on the Victorian side of the river which states that Mitchell and his party camped at the location on 17 October 1836 and then crossed the river slightly downstream of their camping point on the following day. Three years later two men with a property in the area set off on the second longest cattle drive of its kind attempted in Australia at that time driving 300 head to South Australia. Also in 1838 the site of the Mitchell river crossing became the location of the first postage mail delivery by a mail carrier, John Conway Bourke when he undertook to deliver the overland mail from Sydney to what would later be called Melbourne. The township appears to have taken its title from a property named Hoolong in the area which was owned by Isaac Rudd and was named after an Aboriginal place name meaning 'beginning of the plains'. Howlong as a township was laid out in 1854. The Post Office opened on 1 January 1861. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. Today Howlong is now an important inland township which services the smaller villages of the area with a range of stores that meet most of the everyday needs of the people of the area. Nearby villages in the area include Brocklesby, Walbundrie & Chiltern Local sporting clubs include the Howlong Football Club, an Australian rules football team, who compete in the Hume Football League and the Howlong Golf Resort which is the biggest membership Club in Australia. The Howlong Golf Resort is The Jack Newton Junior Golf Club Of The Year 2011, the 2012 Golf Australia Centre Of The Year, the 2014 Highly Commended Winners from Clubs NSW, the 2015 Community Awards Finalist from Clubs NSW and hosts the renowned Top of the Murray and Murray Masters Tournaments.

Madrazo was born on the rancher√≠a of Parrilla, in the state of Tabasco, to P√≠oquinto Madrazo L√≥pez, a businessman, and Concepci√≥n Becerra, a schoolteacher. His childhood was marked by poverty, but his mother taught him the will to overcome adversity. He was an avid learner, studying at the Jos√© N. Rovirosa Institute, where his oratory skills led to his being selected to give a speech on Benito Ju√°rez on the hero's birthday. Tabasco governor Ausencio Conrado Cruz and Tom√°s Garrido Canabal, president of the pro-Calles Central Resistance League, both present as the event, were impressed with his eloquence. Following the event, Garrido Canabal invited Madrazo on his statewide speaking tours, where he became known as \\"the young tribune\\". Madrazo received a scholarship from the state government of Tabasco and studied at Ju√°rez University where he organized the Confederation of Southeastern Socialist Students (Confederaci√≥n de Estudiantes Socialistas del Sureste), which also drew support from peasants and labor. He also wrote for the newspaper Rendici√≥n. He moved to Mexico City to continue his studies at the National Preparatory School, and in 1937 represented the Society of National Preparatory School Students as their president at the Second Congress of Mexican Socialist Students in Uruapan, Michoac√°n. In the same year, he earned his law degree from the National Autonomous University and joined the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM, later renamed PRI), becoming its president from 1938 to 1939. He also presided over the Confederation of Mexican Youth. In 1942 he was appointed General Director of Social Action of the Mexican Federal District (DF) and in 1944 became Director of the National School of Archivists and Librarians. In 1943, he became a federal deputy of the second electoral district of the DF, but as a supporter of Javier Rojo G√≥mez, who aspired to succeed President Manuel √Åvila Camacho, he was targeted by Rojo G√≥mez's rivals, who implicated him in a scheme to disperse fraudulent Bracero Program cards to would-be migrants. As a result, he was imprisoned. In 1952, Madrazo was named Chief of the Legal Departament of the Sugarcane Commission. The same year his son Roberto Madrazo, who would later go on to represent the PRI in the 2006 Mexican presidential election, was born. In 1954 he wrote An√©cdotas de Personajes Famosos (\\"Anecdotes of Famous People\\"). He represented the Tabasco state government in Mexico City, and supported Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos's successful bid for the presidency, campaigning on his behalf. When L√≥pez Mateos arrived in Tabasco, he proposed the development of the Southeast of Mexico as a possibility for the country's prime source of income. On April 20, 1958, Madrazo took the oath of candidacy for the office of Governor of Tabasco, and was elected in 1959. His governorship saw public improvements such as 100 kilometers of roadway and the opening of hundreds of schools and hospitals in addition to private developments such as milk rehydration and pasteurization plants and the industrialization of the cacao industry at C√°rdenas. Following his governorship, President Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz appointed Madrazo to the presidency of the PRI, hoping that his energetic but loyal leadership would placate the youthful faction of the party without disrupting the old guard's control of the party. But Madrazo took his appointment as a mandate to democratize the party. He replaced old and corrupt party officials with dynamic members of the new generation, and tried to institute such reforms as open primaries for local offices, and a \\"Commission of Honor\\" to investigate and punish political corruption. These proposals lay bare the empty nature of Mexican \\"democracy\\" and earned him enemies within the PRI, and in 1965 he was forced to resign his leadership of the party. After being relieved of his duties, he returned to his position as the head of the national librarian school. He continued to be active in the PRI, beginning \\"an unprecedented campaign of sniping at the government from the sidelines\\", whence he \\"gathered a considerable body of opinion behind him\\". In 1969 he died in the Mexicana Flight 704 plane crash on Pico del Fraile Hill in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, with his wife Graciela Pintado.

He performed with the World Wrestling Federation under the ring names Brady Boone and Battle Kat. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1984-1986)= Peters started his career in 1984, working for Don Owen's NWA Pacific Northwest Wrestling promotion. He wrestled under the ring name Brady Boone, and was billed as the cousin of Billy Jack Haynes. After teaming with Haynes, Boone won the Tag Team Championship twice in 1986; first with Coco Samoa on March 29, then with Ricky Santana on October 4. =World Wrestling Federation (1986‚Äì1988)= While wrestling for PNW, Peters (as Brady Boone) and Haynes also worked as a jobber tag team for the World Wrestling Federation from late 1986 to early 1988. Boone began wrestling full-time for the WWF on July 2, 1987, used primarily as an upper-level opening match wrestler. Despite his role on television as a jobber, Boone won many matches on the house show circuit including defeats of Barry Horowitz, The Gladiator, Jos√© Estrada Sr. and ultimately compiled an overall singles record that included 19 wins that year.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm Meanwhile, on television Boone lost almost all of his encounters, but challenged The Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental Championship on the December 8, 1987 and May 10, 1988 episodes of Superstars. Boone was involved in one major angle on October 31, 1987, when he tagged with Scott Casey in a losing effort against Demolition. Following the match Demolition continued to attack Boone, leading first Billy Jack Haynes and then Ken Patera (Haynes' ally in a recent feud with Bobby Heenan) to make the save but also be beaten down. Boone was stretchered out as a part of angle that led to Demolition feuding with the team of Haynes and Ken Patera plus various other allies. The following year Boone won an additional 24 matches,http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm and finished his run with a victory over Steve Lombardi on Sep 12, 1988 in South Bend, Indiana. =World Wrestling Federation - Battle Kat (1990)= Brady Boone returned to the WWF on May 4, 1990 on a house show in a loss to Paul Diamond. He wrestled in numerous house show and television matches between May and August. At a house show on September 13, 1990, Peters debuted as Battle Kat, a character who donned a cat mask and utilized his gymnastics background to emphasize his \\"cat-like\\" agility. He pinned The Brooklyn Brawler. Six days later, Battle Kat won his televised debut match over Bob Bradley, on the September 19 episode of Wrestling Challenge. Battle Kat remained undefeated on house shows and defeated Paul Diamond on the October 30 episode of Wrestling Challenge before he was released from the WWF. Bob Bradley replaced Brady Boone in the Battle Kat character. =Independent circuit (1991, 1992)= After leaving the WWF, Peters took a brief hiatus from wrestling. He reappeared at the Universal Wrestling Federation's only pay-per-view, Beach Brawl on June 9, 1991, where he and Jim Cooper lost to The Blackhearts (Apocalypse and Destruction). As Fire Cat, he wrestled in the Florida-based Suncoast Pro Wrestling and won its Tag Team Championship with Jerry Lynn. After losing the title, Peters took another hiatus before debuting in All Japan Pro Wrestling under his Fire Cat name on March 4, 1992. He and Richard Slinger lost a tag team match to Lt. James Earl Wright and Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker. =World Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1994)= Peters signed with World Championship Wrestling in 1993, and debuted (as Brady Boone) on the December 7 episode of Saturday Night, losing a tag team match (with partner Scott Studd) to Pretty Wonderful (Paul Orndorff and Paul Roma). On the January 10, 1994 episode of Saturday Night, Boone lost to Steve Austin. After not appearing on television for several months, Boone wrestled his final match on the July 23 episode of Saturday Night, defeating Rip Rogers. After retiring as a wrestler, Boone remained with the company as a referee. Death and legacy On December 15, 1998, while driving home to Tampa, Florida from a WCW television taping in Orlando, Peters died in an automobile accident. Despite being smaller than most wrestlers, Peters inspired several up-and-coming wrestlers with his athleticism, including Rob Van Dam. The two met while Peters was wrestling in Florida for Suncoast Pro Wrestling. Peters helped Van Dam during his early years in wrestling, and persuaded Giant Baba to allow Van Dam to tour with All Japan Pro Wrestling. The last time Van Dam saw Peters was also the only time he wrestled him. In tribute, Van Dam uses moves that Peters himself used. Personal life Peters attended Robbinsdale High School in 1976 alongside fellow future wrestlers Curt Hennig, Tom Zenk and Rick Rude. John Nord and Nikita Koloff (class of 1977), and Barry Darsow (class of 1978). He is the uncle of former wrestler and WCW referee Johnny Boone.

It is a lively resort, attracting tourists from many European countries. It has a long, sandy beach and a variety of shops, bars and tavernas. From Stalis, the Bulgarian trail leads to Mochos village, built by the captive Bulgarians during WWII. In the village's main square, one finds the Byzantine church of St. Ioannis (St. John) dating back to 1600. Popular with families, it is 30 km from Nikos Kazantsakis airport in Heraklion.

It is now part of the East Dunbartonshire council area but prior to 1975 was in the historic county of Stirlingshire. It had a population of 4,094 at the 2011 UK Census. History Thomas Muir Lennoxtown Friendly Victualling Society Lennoxtown church, built in the 1820s The focus of the Lennoxtown area used to be the busy Lennox Mill, where tenants of the Woodhead estate brought their corn to be ground. There were several corn mills in Campsie Parish, but this was arguably the most important. Lennox Mill was located in the vicinity of the recently demolished Kali Nail Works. A significant event in the history of the locality was the establishment of the calico printing works at Lennoxmill during the late 1780s, on a site adjacent to the old corn mill. Calico is a type of cotton cloth, and the printing of cotton cloth was soon established as a major industry in the area, also at Milton of Campsie. It was to provide accommodation for the block makers and other cotton printing workers that the village of Lennoxtown was established, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Streets of houses were planned and built according to a formal plan. Lennoxtown was at first known as 'Newtown of Campsie', to distinguish it from the 'Kirktoun' or 'Clachan' of Campsie, at the foot of Campsie Glen. During the 19th century Lennoxtown grew to be the largest centre of population in Campsie Parish. Another important industry was soon established - a chemical works, founded by Charles Macintosh (of waterproof clothing fame) and his associates. At first their principal product was alum, a chemical employed in the textile industry. Alumschist, the basic ingredient in the process, was mined in the area. The works came to be known as the Secret Works, presumably because of the need to keep the industrial processes secret. During the 1790s many of the Lennoxmill workers supported the political reformer Thomas Muir of Huntershill in his campaigns to establish democracy in Scotland, and a Reform Society was set up in Campsie in 1792. However, the parish minister, the Rev. James Lapslie, saw to it that there was also some opposition to Muir's ideas in the area. An important milestone in the drive towards democracy was the establishment in 1812 of a local co- operative society, the Lennoxtown Friendly Victualling Society, one of the earliest of its kind in Scotland. The growing importance of Lennoxtown was underlined by the removal of the parish church from the Clachan to the New Town during the 1820s. Plans for the new church were prepared by the architect David Hamilton, who was also responsible for the nearby Lennox Castle. A Roman Catholic church was erected in 1846 (originally St Paul's, later renamed St Machan's), one of the earliest post-Reformation Catholic churches in Scotland, apart from those in cities and large towns. The decline of the industries that flourished during the nineteenth century, and also the later nail-making industry (and indeed the famous Victualling Society) has left Lennoxtown in a kind of post-industrial limbo, from which it has been difficult to escape. Slow progress continues to be made. The town was well known in Scottish football circles as the home of Campsie Black Watch FC, an under-21 club founded in 1943 which launched the careers of many professional playersCampsie heroes facing a black future 61 years of history threatened, The Herald, 30 October 2004 (Willie Garner, Eddie Gallagher, Johnny Walker, Frank Haffey, Mike Larnach, Jim Thomson), also winning the Scottish Juvenile Cup 11 times between 1955 and 2014 before eventually folding in 2017,Campsie Black Watch fold after 74 years at the top, Youth Football Scotland, 27 June 2017 a short time before the death of long-serving president Gerry Marley.Campsie Black Watch boss Gerry Marley passes away, Kirkintilloch Herald, 20 December 2018 Primary schools = St Machan's = St Machan's Primary School was opened in 1964, replacing a smaller school on Bencloich Road. The old building was then used as the Campsie Recreation Centre, until demolition in 2009. In 2009, St Machan's had 200 pupils. It is a feeder school for St Ninian's High School in Kirkintilloch. In 2009, St Machan's had 200 pupils enrolled in the school and would later move on to St Ninian's High School which enrolled 757 pupils in 2009. In 2013, there was a petition in order to get a skate park to replace the old recreation centre and was handed out in the local businesses to get members of the local community to sign. = Lennoxtown Primary School = In 1839 the Lennoxtown New Subscription School was given a grant of ¬£280,000 from the government in order to rebuild. The school was made up of two large buildings and opened in 1840. It had a room for over one hundred primary age pupils and a second room for infant pupils. A new school was built in 1896 and expanded to seven classrooms for 458 pupils. The Lennoxtown Public School was reduced to the status of Lennoxtown Primary School in 1963, with secondary pupils instead attending Kilsyth Academy. Lennoxtown Primary enrolled 128 pupils in 2009. The Community Hub In 2016, a Community Hub was opened on Main Street to focus on the delivery of public services. It brought together the existing East Dunbartonshire Library, the NHS Clinic, containing a dental practice and GP consulting rooms. and the Housing office in one building. One of the oldest surviving branches of the Co-operative was demolished as part of the development after an attempt to have the building listed was unsuccessful. Lennoxtown Railway The railway to Lennoxtown was an extension of the Glasgow to Edinburgh line. The first of this line, from Lenzie to Lennoxtown, were built by the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway, under powers obtained in 1845 and it was officially opened on 5 July 1848. The railway was initially intended to serve the print fields at Lennoxtown but it eventually allowed passengers and provided this service as far as Aberfoyle. The passenger service was discontinued in October 1951, the transportation of goods continuing but only as far as Lennoxtown from 1959. The line closed completely in 1966. Lennoxtown Station won first prize for being the best kept railway station in Scotland in 1897 and then for 7 years in succession from 1922 to 1928 and again in 1930 and 1931. Lennoxtown Training Centre The training centre in 2007 It was announced that Celtic training ground was going to be built in Lennoxtown' in 2005 by the then manager Gordon Strachan. The training ground was built on the grounds of Lennox castle and was officially opened in October 2007. The facility has three natural grass, UEFA match-size pitches and one full-size, all weather, artificial pitch which is floodlit. There is undersoil heating, a state-of-the-art gym, a sauna and steam room and changing facilities. Local football teams, such as the Campsie Boys' Club, train there once a week. Celtic liaise with the local schools (St. Machan's and Lennoxtown Primary School) to allow occasional use of their training facilities. There are educational facilities for the young Celtic Academy footballers at the ground and arrangements for them to attend St.Ninian's High School in Kirkintilloch. The school football team use the training ground facilities. Stuart Findlay was part of the initial intake of this scheme in 2009 before leaving Celtic and establishing himself as a professional with Kilmarnock. Town hall In the 1860s a town hall at Lennoxtown was built, now called the Campsie Memorial Hall; construction began in 1866 and was funded by subscription. Two years later, the hall was opened. Altogether, it cost ¬£1,340. In the 1950s the District Council took over the hall in order for the building to be renovated. The threat of the Campsie Memorial Hall being shut down in 2010 due to lack of funding, made the residents of Lennoxtown come together to offer up their own solutions. More than 150 people attended a public meeting to talk over plans for the hall and around 35 residents signed up to be on the committee for managing the town hall The hall itself was taken over by volunteers from Lennoxtown in late 2012 and has been thriving since. In 2013, they were given a grant from the EDC Civic Pride Fund and received funding from the Big Lottery, which were both used to improve the hall.

Biography Edward Payson Weston was born on March 15, 1839 in Providence, Rhode Island to Silas Weston, a teacher and publisher, and Maria Gaines, a writer. As a teenager, Weston published books about his father's trips to the California Gold Rush and to the Azores, and he also published a novel written by his mother in 1859. During childhood Weston moved frequently, and by his own account, spent some time travelling with the popular Hutchinson Family Singers.Weston. 1861; p.47. He first received attention as a notable pedestrian in 1861, when he walked 478 miles (769 km) from Boston, Massachusetts to Washington, D.C. in 10 days and 10 hours, from February 22 to March 4. During the walk, he faced snow, rain, and mud, and he fell several times. His longest period of uninterrupted sleep was 6 hours, and he usually ate while walking. He arrived in Washington at 5:00 pm, and was strong enough to attend Abraham Lincoln's inaugural ball that evening. Title page of Weston's account of his Boston-DC walk in 1861 The walk was part of the terms of a bet on the 1860 presidential election. The bettor whose candidate lost was to walk to Washington to see the inauguration of the new president. Weston lost when he bet against Lincoln, and received only a bag of peanuts for his trouble. However, he also received newspaper coverage and a congratulatory handshake from the new president, which inspired him to further pedestrian feats. In 1867, Weston walked from Portland, Maine to Chicago, Illinois, covering over 1200 miles (1900 km) in 26 days, winning a prize of $10,000. He received several death threats from gamblers who had bet against him, and was attacked once. He gave lectures to crowds of spectators on the health benefits of walking, both during the walk and afterwards. Over the next few decades, Weston continued his professional walking career. While he was sometimes beaten in indoor multiday races, he held numerous records for long-distance endurance events. In 1869 he walked 1058 miles (1703 km) through snow-covered New England in 30 days. In 1871, he walked backwards for 200 miles around St. Louis, Missouri in 41 hours. Weston spent 8 years touring Europe, starting in 1876 in England where he challenged England's racewalking champion to a 24-hour, 115 mile ultramarathon. The Englishman quit 14 hours and 65.6 miles into the race, but Weston walked the full 24 hours and covered 109.5 miles. His performance caused a bit of a controversy when he later admitted to having been chewing coca leaf throughout much of the race.Steven B. Karch. A Brief History of Cocaine, 2nd Edition. This story can be found online in a preview of the book. In 1879 he defeated the British champion \\"Blower\\" Brown, in a 550-mile (890 km) match which he walked in 141 hours 44 minutes, winning him the prestigious Astley Belt. In April 1906, Weston walked from Philadelphia to New York, a distance of over 100 miles, in less than 24 hours. In 1907, at the age of 68, Weston repeated his Maine-to-Chicago walk of 1867, beating his own time by over 24 hours. In 1909, he walked 4,000 miles, from New York to San Francisco, in 100 days. His last great journey was in 1913, when he walked 1546 miles (2488 km) from New York to Minneapolis in 51 days. Weston spent most of the remainder of his life urging others to take up walking for exercise and competition. He warned that automobiles were making people lazy and sedentary. Death Weston was severely injured when he was struck by a New York City taxicab in 1927, and never walked again. He died in his sleep two years later. Legacy His life story has been told in the 2012 biography, A Man in a Hurry, described by U.S. sports writer Brian Phillips as \\"a spectacularly entertaining book.\\" His career biography, \\"Weston, Weston, Rah-Rah-Rah!\\", was also published in 2012.

On November 13, 1577, Lerma was named Governor of Tucum√°n, (in present Argentina) by Spanish King Philip II. Described by historians as a man of violence, de Lerma had problems with several people from the area, including fellow countrymen. Among those he persecuted were the spokesman of a Catholic bishop. He also disliked Francisco Salcedo, another Catholic man who built a church in Santiago del Estero. Many of de Lerma's opponents ended up in jail or being killed. Salcedo retired to another city and became convalescent, but he was returned to Tucum√°n by de Lerma's men after he found him. In Tucum√°n, Salcedo was tried and jailed. A large number of Salcedo's supporters were killed. In April 1582, de Lerma founded the city of Salta, next to the Arenales River. He foresaw Salta as an economic center, since the Spanish government had opened seaports in Santiago de Chile, Callao and Buenos Aires. Salta's situation between the Viceroyalty of Peru and the port at the R√≠o de la Plata river, according to de Lerma, would be an advantage for the city, as it connected the city directly with the aforementioned places, and de Lerma believed that Madrid's government would re-route their shipments through Salta. He had the city named \\"Lerma City on Salta Valley\\". Hernando de Lerma befriended Indians who populated the area, believing their hands could be of help to him. He also attracted other Spaniards to the area. After he established the city, however, de Lerma had to face many new rivals and problems. More conquerors arrived in Salta and tried to seize the city, causing multiple feuds. The city went through many periods of disease, and it had been erected in an area with frequent tremors. In 1584, de Lerma was arrested and sentenced to jail in Salta. He appealed, and returned to Spain to take his case to the supreme court, but his appeal was rejected and he was sent to a Spanish jail. While it is known he died in jail, the year in which he died is not known. Historian Paul Goussac said that \\"de Lerma's administration was nothing but a series of criminal attempts.\\" Salta-born historian Armando Bazan describes de Lerma \\"as malign as a disease\\" in one of his books.

The town lies within the Shire of Mount Marshall and is home to approximately 294 people as of 2011. Surveyor General John Septimus Roe first surveyed the region in 1836 and he was followed by sandalwood cutters and stockmen, but it was not until 1908 that the first permanent settlers arrived. The name \\"Bencubbin\\" comes from the Aboriginal word for \\"place of the snakes\\" and is now applied to the rock to the north of the town. The aboriginal word is generally spelt \\"Gnylbencubbing\\" and is not the rock known as Mount Marshall. Mount Marshall is south-east of Bencubbin, whereas the rock known as Gnylbencubbing is at the northern edge of the township. Mount Marshall is named after Captain Marshall MacDermott, who was the first manager of the Western Australian branch of the Bank of Australasia. These two rocks and Wiacubbing Hill are three of the largest outcrops around Bencubbin. The name was suggested for the railway station at terminus of the Wyalkatchem to Mount Marshall railway line, by J Hope, the Chief Draftsman, in 1913. The townsite was gazetted later in 1917. The first Bencubbin police station was founded in 1923. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. The town supermarket was destroyed by a fire in 2006 which started early in the morning. The fire was brought under control in two hours causing no injuries and causing over 100,000. The Police Station manned by two officers saw them mobilise and assist to keep the town running. A makeshift store was set up to provide valuable supplies to the community The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. Governance Bencubbin, along with the town Beacon make up the shire of Mt. Marshall which falls under the electorate of Durack. The Shire of Mt Marshall has 7 elected Councillors who are elected by the residents of the Shire on the third Saturday in October every second year. The Council meets to address the issues of the shire on the last Tuesday of every month. Demographics According to the conducted in Western Australia in 2011, 90.1% of the population of bencubbin were born in Australia. The predominant ethnicity of Bencubbin consists mainly from immigrants of British and Irish heritage who settled in the region from the 1890s on wards. Due to such a large influx of immigrants from western Europe, the main religion today in Bencubbin are denominations of Christianity, specifically Anglican (35.1%), Catholic (18.9%), Uniting Church (9.1%) and 21.3% state no religious affiliation. English is the most commonly spoken language with 96.2% of the township speaking only English. Sport The Bencubbin township participates in numerous sporting leagues including golf, cricket, hockey, netball and the most popular being Australian football, a code of football indigenous to Australia http://www.bencubbin.com/pages/sporting-clubs.php. The Bencubbin football club, known colloquially as the demons, participates in the central Wheatbelt football league. An amateur sporting league that consists of six clubs from surrounding townships who have competed against each other since 1968, where Bencubbin was a founding member of the league. Bencubbin have won five premiership titles in their history which is third highest overall in the league. Notable events Image of a fragment from the Bencubbin Meteor, housed at the Smithsonian Institution Making Bencubbin infamous in the field of geology was the discovery in 1930 of 58 kg, rare and previously unknown type of meteorite which was aptly named \\"the Bencubbin\\".

The song's producer was Gene Martynec, who won the Juno Award for Producer of the Year for his work on \\"High School Confidential\\" and Bruce Cockburn's \\"Tokyo\\". It was written by the band's main songwriting team, Carole Pope and Kevan Staples. Some references incorrectly credit Jerry Lee Lewis and Ron Hargrave as the songwriters,\\"Rough Trade: Avoid Freud\\". AllMusic. but the Rough Trade song is not a cover of the Jerry Lee Lewis song of the same name. Although the song uses the title of the 1958 film High School Confidential, as well as references which suggest that the song is set in a similar time frame, the lyrics do not strongly resemble the film's drug-related plot. Instead, the song's narrator is a student observing a sexy female classmate, a \\"cool blonde scheming bitch\\" whose activities suggest that she may be having sexual relations with adult men, including the high school principal. The narrator compares the classmate to 1950s sex symbols Mamie Van Doren, Anita Ekberg and Dagmar, and reveals her own unrequited lust for her: in one of the most famous lyrics from the song, Pope sings \\"She makes me cream my jeans when she comes my way\\". The lyrics never explicitly state the narrator's own sex, so they may be read either as Pope speaking from a male perspective, or as a reference to lesbianism. In a 2000 interview with Eye Weekly, Pope confirmed that while she intended the lyric from her own perspective as a lesbian, the ambiguity was intentional: \\"The general public didn't get that I was gay ‚Äì if you were gay you did ‚Äì and when I wrote love songs, I wanted them to be interpreted however. The thing is, I really, really love men ‚Äì straight men are very sexy as long as, you know, they don't try ‚Äì and I think that comes across in my songs. Rock 'n' roll is about desire and passion, and I'm singing to both sexes.\\" Popular impact At the time of its release, it was one of the most sexually explicit songs ever to reach the Canadian pop charts, and despite the sexual ambiguity, the first with such strong lesbian overtones. Although controversial, the song was a Top 20 hit, peaking at No. 12 nationwide on the RPM singles chart (#1 on their CANCON Chart) on June 20, 1981 and at No. 8 on the CHUM Chart in Toronto on May 30 of the same year.CHUM Chart, May 30, 1981. However, some radio stations refused to play the song, and others played a censored version with some of the most controversial lyrics removed; CHUM-FM paid for the band to record a cleaned-up version that avoided the line, \\"She makes me cream my jeans when she comes my way.\\"Pope, Carole. Anti Diva. Vintage Canada, 2001, p.143. par. 1 (The band's subsequent hit \\"Crimes of Passion\\", which included an explicit verse about a gay male couple, also faced similar controversy.) k.d. lang was apparently inspired by seeing the band perform the number on the televised Juno Awards presentation that year, \\"seeing [Carole] set a tone for me that I could be out, no question\\".Pope, Carole. Anti Diva. Vintage Canada, 2001, p.144. par. 1 Merrill Nisker (now known by her stage name \\"Peaches\\") covered the song on her 1995 album Fancypants Hoodlum. The song appeared in the 1991 Canadian film The Adjuster, directed by Atom Egoyan. In 1999, the German band Alphaville covered \\"High School Confidential\\" on their album Dreamscapes. In 2004, the band Lesbians on Ecstasy released \\"The Pleasure Principal\\", a response song in which the high school's principal calls Pope to the office to discuss Pope's obsession with her classmate. In 2005, \\"High School Confidential\\" was named the 38th greatest Canadian song of all time on the CBC Radio One series 50 Tracks: The Canadian Version. Queer as Folk In 2000, Pope recorded a new version of \\"High School Confidential\\" for the television series Queer as Folk, with the lyrics altered to reflect a gay male perspective: \\"He's a cool blond scheming trick...He's a combination Tom Cruise-Zack O'Toole\\". (Zack O'Toole was a fictional porn star in QAF, played by Matthew G. Taylor.) This version appears on the show's first season soundtrack album.

Wodehouse that first appeared in the United States in two parts, in the October 10 and October 17, 1936 editions of the Saturday Evening Post, and in the United Kingdom in the January 1937 issue of the Strand (as \\"Crime Wave at Blandings\\"). It was included in the collection Lord Emsworth and Others (1937), and provided the title to the U.S. equivalent of that collection.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 72‚Äì73, A57‚Äì58. The story was a rewritten version of an older piece, entitled \\"Creatures of Impulse\\", which had appeared in the Strand in October 1914, and in the U.S. in McClure's that same month. \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\" is set at Blandings Castle, home of Lord Emsworth, and features several other recurring characters. Plot Lord Emsworth's sister, Lady Constance, has decided that Emsworth's grandson George needs a tutor to keep him in line over the summer holidays and chooses Rupert Baxter, Emsworth's former secretary. Emsworth is worried that Constance is trying to get the controlling and unpleasant Baxter reinstated as his secretary. George, who does not want to be tutored during the summer holidays, dislikes Baxter, and Emsworth sympathizes with George. Meanwhile, Lord Emsworth's niece Jane is engaged to George Abercrombie. Constance disapproves since Abercrombie does not have money or a job, and wants Jane to marry someone else. Lord Emsworth previously agreed to give Abercrombie the position of land agent at Blandings, but Constance pushes Emsworth, who just wants to be left alone so he can read Whiffle on The Care Of The Pig, to rescind the job offer. This dismays Jane. The butler Beach brings an airgun and a box of ammunition to Emsworth. The gun was confiscated from young George on Lady Constance's instructions. George shot Baxter in the seat of the trousers while Baxter was tying his shoes. Emsworth again sympathizes with George. He reminisces about a time in his youth when his sister Julia borrowed his airgun to shoot her governess, and Beach mentions that he also had an airgun when he was young. Later, Emsworth sees Baxter outside bending over to pick up a cigarette. Acting on an impulse inspired by his childhood memories, Emsworth shoots Baxter with the airgun through a window. Baxter angrily comes into the room, thinking that George shot him again. Constance, however, suspects that Emsworth shot Baxter. Jane saw Emsworth shoot Baxter and threatens to tell Constance unless he writes a letter to Abercrombie giving him the land agent job. Emsworth writes the letter for her. Baxter eavesdropped on their conversation and knows Emsworth shot him. To keep Baxter from telling Constance, Emsworth reluctantly offers him his old job as secretary, which Baxter gladly accepts. However, Beach later delivers a note from Baxter in which he declines the job and says he will leave Blandings. Emsworth fears Baxter has decided to tell Constance after all, and Jane advises him to deny everything Baxter says. Furthermore, Beach announces he is resigning. Constance admits she shot Beach with George's airgun on an impulse. Though Emsworth had thought he remembered Julia shooting the governess, it had actually been Constance. Emsworth is alarmed about their indispensable butler resigning but relieved that Constance can hardly reproach him now. In front of Constance, Baxter accuses Emsworth of shooting him, which Emsworth denies, and says he was willing to return as secretary until Emsworth shot him a second time, though Emsworth only shot him once. Constance wants Baxter to stay, but Emsworth insists that Baxter will go, and that Jane will marry Abercrombie as she wants to. Beach tells Emsworth that he is resigning because he acted on an impulse and shot Baxter (though Baxter mistakenly thought Emsworth shot him again). He is not resigning because of Constance and says her shot actually missed. Emsworth convinces Beach to stay by telling him that Baxter is leaving, and decides to test his aim by again shooting Baxter through a window. Baxter shouts and immediately leaves on his motorcycle. Beach raises a glass of port in a toast to Emsworth's success. Publication history \\"Creatures of Impulse\\", the original story which \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\" was rewritten from, was published in October 1914 in the Strand with illustrations by T. Victor Hall.McIlvaine (1990), p. 183, D133.36. It was published in the same month in McClure's with illustrations by Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock.McIlvaine (1990), p. 152, D38.3. \\"Creatures of Impulse\\" was not published in book form until it was included in the 1993 collection Plum Stones, with commentary by Tony Ring. In \\"Creatures of Impulse\\", the main character, Sir Godfrey Tanner, has a valet named Jevons, who is very competent and usually performs his duties flawlessly. According to David A. Jasen's biography of P. G. Wodehouse, Jevons was a predecessor to Wodehouse's well- known character Jeeves, who is also a very competent valet. \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\" was rewritten from \\"Creatures of Impulse\\" and was published more than twenty years after the original story. \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\" was published in October 1936 in two parts in the Saturday Evening Post, with illustrations by Charles LaSalle.McIlvaine (1990), p. 157, D59.94‚Äì95. It was published in The Strand Magazine in January 1937, with illustrations by Gilbert Wilkinson.McIlvaine (1990), p. 186, D133.209. The story was collected in The Best of Wodehouse, a 1949 collection of Wodehouse stories selected by Scott Meredith, published in the US by Pocket Books.McIlvaine (1990), p. 118, B8. It was included in the 1981 collection Wodehouse on Crime, published by Ticknor & Fields in the US and edited by D. R. Bensen with a foreword by Isaac Asimov.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 125‚Äì126, B23. The UK anthology In Praise of Humour, published by Muller in 1949 and edited by Neville Hilditch, included an excerpt from \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\".McIlvaine (1990), p. 195, E57. Adaptations A radio dramatisation of \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\" aired in 1939, with C. V. France as Lord Emsworth, Thea Holme as Jane, J. B. Rowe as Beach, Gladys Young as Lady Constance, Carleton Hobbs as Rupert Baxter, and Robert Holland as George. It was produced by John Cheatle. \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\" was adapted for television as an episode of The World of Wodehouse in 1967, under the title \\"Lord Emsworth and the Crime Wave at Blandings\\". In 1985, the story was adapted into two episodes of the Blandings radio series. \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\" was adapted for television again in 2013, as the fourth episode in the series Blandings.

He is referred to as the \\"eternal prophet\\" and creates the visionary city of Golgonooza. Los is regularly described as a smith, beating with his hammer on a forge, which is metaphorically connected to the beating of the human heart. The bellows of his forge are the human lungs. Los's emanation, Enitharmon, represents spiritual beauty and embodies pity, but at the same time creates the spatial aspect of the fallen world, weaving bodies for men and creating sexual strife through her insistence upon chastity.Damon 1988 pp. 124‚Äì125 In the Book of Urizen (1794), Los and Enitharmon have a child, Orc, who is the embodiment of the spirit of revolution. The name Los is, by common critical acceptance, an anagram of Sol, the Latin word for \\"sun\\". Such innovations are common in many of Blake's prophetic poems. Background Blake attributed the origin of Los and many of his prophetic works to his home in Lambeth:Bentley 2003 pp. 124‚Äì125 \\"Los descended to me... trembling I stood... in the Vale of Lambeth; but he kissed me and wished me health\\".Bentley 2003 qtd p. 125 Character Jerusalem. This image comes from Copy E. of the work, printed in 1821 and in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art Los is the divine aspect of the imagination. After he becomes more mechanical and regular in his actions, he falls and becomes part of the material world. In the fallen state, he becomes the creator of life and of organic systems. He also creates reproduction and the sexes, with his own partner Enitharmon soon after being created. He then creates consciousness through evolution, which leads to the creation of humans. Los is particularly focused on humans and he uses them to breed art and use their imaginations. Eventually, it is through the evolutions of the world that Orc is formed. Like Orc and Orc's cycles, Los is part of cycles as he tries to create the Golgonooza at the beginning of time and the image appears constantly in art. Los's imagination is also connected to the natural cycle, and art within the individual is developed through natural cycles. Art is mimetic of nature but order within nature. Los represents the progression through life to the conscious state.Frye 1990 pp. 254‚Äì258 Appearances Two forms of Los with Enitharmon, Plate 100 of Jerusalem Los appears in The Book of Urizen (1794) as an eternal prophet that binds Urizen after Urizen, the creator of the world suffers from a spiritual fall.Bentley 2003 pp. 152‚Äì153 He appears in the connected works The Song of Los, America a Prophecy and Europe a Prophecy at the same time. In these works, he begins as a prophet in Africa that describes how Urizen gave laws to the people that bound the minds of mankind. This was accomplished through Los's children with Enitharmon: \\"Thus the terrible race of Los & Enitharmon gave / Laws & Religions to the sons of Har binding them more / And more to Earth: closing and restraining\\" (lines 44‚Äì46).Bentley 2003 pp. 154‚Äì155 The Book of Los, completed at the same time, continues from the story of The Book of Urizen and describes how Los fell and was bound in a human form. It also describes how Los, in turn, bound Urizen in a human form.Bentley 2003 pp. 156‚Äì157 In The Book of Urizen, Los is constantly at struggle with Urizen to control the world and the two represent opposites. However, this was to later change when Blake added two other beings in his later work.Bentley 2003 pp. 198‚Äì199 In the early works, however, the binary system is possibly similar to the imaginative and reason sides that Blake divided his own mind and a struggle between the two. He also felt that Los was closely connected to Christ, and that is why Los dominated within his myth.Bentley 2003 pp. 271‚Äì272 Los with the child Orc and Enitharmon, in Blake's A Large Book of Designs. Produced c. 1796, this print is copy A of object 2 in the copy currently held by the British Museum. In Jerusalem (1804‚Äì1820), it is said that Los was the progenitor of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and the other Biblical spiritual leaders.Bentley 2003 p. 11 The work also describes the Four Zoas that are four parts that were united in Eternity but exist in a state similar to a giant after their fall. These four parts include Los and Urizen along with Tharmas and Luvah. The Four Zoas appear also in 2nd edition of Vala, or the Four Zoas (1807) and Milton: a Poem.Bentley 2003 p. 199 In Milton: a Poem (1804‚Äì1810), Los appears as a flaming sun.Bentley 2003 p. 217 This view of Los and the sun is similar to a description in a poem that Blake included in a letter (22 November 1802) that he wrote to Thomas Butts, and he believed that in the vision he was able to unite with Los.Bentley 2003 p. 269 In Vala, or the Four Zoas, Los witnesses a vision of the Lamb of God being sacrificed to reveal his spiritual side while Urizen and the Synagogue of Satan work against Christ and are the ones who condemn him to death. After the Synagogue of Satan promotes Deism, Los seizes the sun and the moon and breaks apart the heavens. The destruction of the world leads to eternity and the second judgment unfolds. The poem ends with Urthona, Los's unfallen state rising up and shepherding in science and removing the dark religions.Bentley 2003 pp. 310‚Äì311 The final version of Jerusalem, completed by 1820, was a Gospel about the imagination as God's presence within humanity, and the messiah figure of the work is Los. Los's purpose was to create his own system in order to be free of any other system, and this system would be based on creation instead of reason. The purpose of the work is to describe Los's triumph and the new apocalypse in which the Lamb of God comes to England to rule.Bentley 2003 pp. 314‚Äì315 In later literature In Ray Nelson's Science Fiction novel \\"Blake's Progress\\", based on the assumption that the poet William Blake and his wife Kate were time travelers, it is assumed that in fact Los was the poet Milton, a fellow time traveler.

Aim is the extension of the knowledge on and/or the improvement of medical treatment of human stroke. Classification by cause The term stroke subsumes cerebrovascular disorders of different etiologies, featuring diverse pathophysiological processes. Thus, for each stroke etiology one or more animal models have been developed: *Animal models of ischemic stroke *Animal models of intracerebral hemorrhage *Animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm *Animal models of sinus vein thrombosis Transferability of animal results to human stroke Although multiple therapies have proven to be effective in animals, only very few have done so in human patients. Reasons for this are (Dirnagl 1999): *Side effects: Many highly potent neuroprotective drugs display side effects which inhibit the application of effective doses in patients (e.g. MK-801) *Delay: Whereas in animal studies the time of incidence onset is known and therapy can be started early, patients often present with delay and unclear time of symptom onset *‚ÄúAge and associated illnesses: Most experimental studies are conducted on healthy, young animals under rigorously controlled laboratory conditions. However, the typical stroke patient is elderly with numerous risk factors and complicating diseases (for example, diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases)‚Äù (Dirnagl 1999) *Morphological and functional differences between the brain of humans and animals: Although the basic mechanisms of stroke are identical between humans and other mammals, there are differences. *Evaluation of efficacy: In animals, treatment effects are mostly measured as a reduction of lesion volume, whereas in human studies functional evaluation (which reflects the severity of disabilities) is commonly used. Thus, therapies might reduce the size of the cerebral lesion (found in animals), but not the functional impairment when tested in patients. Ethical considerations Stroke models are carried out on animals which inevitably suffer during the procedure. These encumbrances are e.g. social stress during single or multiple animal caging (depending on the species), transport, animal handling, food deprivation, pain after surgical procedures, neurological disabilities etc. Thus, according to general consensus, these experiments require ethical justification. The following arguments can be produced to give reason for the conduction of animal experiments in stroke research: *Stroke is very frequent in humans. *Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the developed countries. *Stroke is the leading cause of permanent disability in the developed countries. *Yet there is no effective treatment available for the majority of stroke patients. *Currently there are no in vitro methods that could satisfactorily simulate the complex interplay of vasculature, brain tissue, and blood during stroke, and thus could replace the greater part of animal experiments. During animal experimentation the following prerequisites have to be fulfilled to maintain the ethical justification (‚Äúthe three Rs‚Äù): *Reduction: Animal numbers have to be kept as little as possible (but as high as necessary - to avoid underpowered studies -) to draw scientific conclusions. *Refinement: Experiments have to be best planned and to be conducted by trained personnel to minimize the suffering of animals on the one hand and to gain as much knowledge as possible out of the utilized animals. *Replacement: Whenever possible animal experiments have to be replaced by other methods (e.g. cell culture, computed simulations etc.).

Early life and career Sergey Afanasyev was born in the city of Klin in the Moscow region. He graduated from the Bauman Moscow State Technical University in 1941, and was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (since 1943). During World War II, he worked as an engineer at an artillery factory in Perm, learning armor design. He became the prot√©g√© of Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov and from 1946 worked in the Ministry of Defence Industries. In the late 1950s, Sergey Afanasyev worked in top management positions in Leningrad, and in the early 1960s in Moscow as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Service as Minister After his appointment in March 1965 as head of the newly created Ministry of General Machine Building, a post he occupied until 1983, Sergey Afanasyev had to build up the new Ministry from zero, uniting numerous defence plants, scientific labs, engineering facilities and famous constructors of space and military rockets under one roof. The new industry under Afanasyev‚Äôs control was a secret formation, and was never publicly acknowledged until the late 1980s. In private circles he was referred to as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first Space Minister‚Äù. Sergey Afanasyev‚Äôs Ministry not only took part in developing his country‚Äôs pioneering space programme but was a key player in the nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States. In the mid-1960s the nuclear arsenal of the USA was larger than the USSR had . But as the Cold War dragged on, Afanasyev‚Äôs Ministry managed to sufficiently increase and almost match the number of nuclear missiles and warheads its main rival had and thus reach a fragile balance of military might. Over 1400 intercontinental ballistic missiles and some 1000 submarine-launched ballistic missiles were manufactured and later modernised by the Ministry, which was also responsible for the day- to-day maintenance of the nuclear arsenal and its control functions. That is why Sergey Afanasyev once admitted that his worst nightmare for many years was that one of the nuclear missiles might self-explode or even be launched by mistake. Sergey Afanasyev was also involved in creating spacecraft for Soviet cosmonauts, orbital space stations, including the Mir station, the first Soviet space shuttle Buran, the Energia rocket, and was a frequent visitor of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, attending the many launches. He worked together with the chief Soviet rocket engineer Sergey Korolyov. Oddly enough, just like many elements of the Soviet economy, the Ministry of General Machine Building at its numerous plants spread from the western part of the USSR to the far east coast also produced TV sets, refrigerators and other home appliances. A skilled manager, Sergey Afanasyev often balanced the \\"warring factions\\" - the different opinions and approaches voiced by academics and rocket engineers such as Vladimir Chelomei and Mikhail Yangel, who competed in designing rocket engines, as well as the interests of different Ministries, including the Ministry of Defence, headed by Dmitriy Ustinov, and also the Communist Party‚Äôs Central Committee. Afanasyev also worked closely with Valentin Glushko, one of the principal Soviet designers of spacecraft and rockets during the Soviet/American Space Race. During his long career, Sergey Afanasyev dealt directly with top Soviet leaders, including Leonid Brezhnev, Konstantin Chernenko, Yuri Andropov and Mikhail Gorbachev, discussing with them and getting funding for both space and defence programmes and projects. He was also a close friend of Boris Yeltsin, who he knew since Yeltsin was the head of the Yekaterinburg regional Communist Party Committee. Afanasyev was elected as deputy of the Congress of Peoples Deputies from the Yekaterinburg region. Sergey Afanasyev was one of the few people who refused to take orders from the feared Soviet police chief Lavrenty Beria. In the 1950s, Beria was pushing for a swift production of missiles and indicated his orders were to be carried out within several months. At a meeting in the Kremlin, Sergey Afanasyev was the only engineer who voiced opposition to the plan, calling it unrealistic. Beria‚Äôs first reaction was to arrest the young engineer, but he was later told that in that case the production would be delayed for over a year because Afanasyev was the only person on the ground knowledgeable enough to take charge. After a reshuffle in the early 1980, Sergey Afanasyev was appointed as the head of the Ministry of Heavy and Transport Machinery, where he worked from 1983 to 1987. Death From 1988 until his death he was the Senior Science Consultant of the S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia. Sergey Afanasyev is buried in Moscow‚Äôs Novodevichy Convent.

Herlindis and Relindis were the daughters of the Frankish nobleman Adelard, who had his daughters brought up at the Benedictine monastery in Valenciennes. In 730 Herlindis's parents set up a Benedictine monastery at Aldeneik for his daughters. Herlindis was consecrated as its first abbess by Willibrord, and held the role until her death, after which Relindis was named to succeed her by Saint Boniface. The two sisters are usually portrayed together, sometimes also with a few nuns, holding either an abbess's staff or a model of the monastery.

It dates from the late 8th or 9th century and was found in Aldeneik Abbey, in Belgium. It is richly decorated in elaborate embroideries of silk and metal thread on a linen base. The casula was not made by the saints themselves, though for centuries it was thought that Harlindis and Relindis made it. Embroidery was seen as an important way to show high social status, and people who could produce it were highly regarded. This is likely why the embroideries came to be associated with the saints, rather than just with the church. Based on analysis of the embroidery style and garment, it most likely dates from after these saints lived so would have had to have been embroidered by someone else. The embroideries were, however, all made at the same time and in the same workshop, though the casula itself has undergone many changes and alterations since it was first made. In the 8th and 9th centuries, cassocks were shaped garments. While this one is rectangular, it looks like it was altered at some point. It was likely altered to be a more modern shape, and may not have been a cassock when it was first created. Originally it was also richly embellished with pearls, and some of the stitching and stitch holes remain. There is a reference to the pearls still being attached in 1647, so they were on the cassock until at least that point in time. =Embroidery and Decorations= The metal embroidery thread in the cassock was made by wrapping gold filament around a horse or cow hair core. This would have been extremely costly and time consuming to create, but this sort of labor was typical for creating vestments. The embroidery completely covers the linen it is embroidered on, as was usual for embroideries at this time. While this is the earliest embroidery found on this scale, it is typical of the art style representative at the time. This is known as the Trewhiddle style of art, which can be seen in the manuscripts and metalwork contemporary to the embroidery. It is known for its dense patterns, swirls, roundels, and intertwined animal motifs. It is also seen famously in the Book of Kells, but was popular in metalwork as well as in other manuscripts. It is likely that this style of artwork is replicating embroidery, as it is based heavily on interlocking motifs. The tablet woven bands edging the casula are similar to Norse ones found in Birka. The bands are made of silk and linen threads like the Birka ones, however they are believed to have been made in England. They are the first tablet-woven bands found to use the gold-wrapped embroidery threads rather than just silk, linen, or wool.

The event was broadcast live on pay-per-view and later released on home video. Although the event was the lowest profile by the contemporary standards (the venue was less than half-packed, the grand prix of the tournament was as big as a regular sparring partner biannual salary, major martial arts observers and columnists didn't bother to show up, the press in general neglected the event, big-name fighters turned down the offers to participate in,) it pioneered the interstylistic match-ups between the practitioners of different martial arts, and set the pattern for the future sporting events of the kind. Background UFC 1 was co-created by Rorion Gracie and the Torrance-based UFC promoter Art Davie, who decided to take locally famous Gracie Garage Challenge fights versus California's martial artists to a new level, televised nationally, with the opponents picked internationally. They didn't come up with a 16-man tournament, as the big-name martial artists, mainly kickboxers, namely Dennis Alexio, Benny Urquidez, Stan Longinidis, Jean-Yves Th√©riault, Rick Roufus, Stan Longinidis, Maurice Smith, Bart Vale, Hee Il Cho, George Dillman, Gene LeBell, Rob Kaman, Peter Aerts, Ernesto Hoost, Masaaki Satake, were among the others \\"publicly invited\\" by Art Davie, but had shown no interest in participating. Davie placed ads in martial arts magazines to recruit fighters. He found less than a dozen who answered the call. The promoters came up with an eight-man tournament format, with the winner receiving $50,000. They wanted it to look brutal on television, so John Milius, one of Rorion Gracie's students and a Hollywood veteran who had directed Conan the Barbarian, decided the fights should take place in an octagonal cage fenced with chain link. Campbell McLaren, a SEG executive, wanted people to consider the championship a live, televised version of Mortal Kombat, a popular video game, in which victorious fighters got to \\"finish\\" their opponents through moves such as ripping their spines out of their bodies. That one and the Davie's idea to top the cage with razor wire were rejected. General regulations agreed upon were: *No doping probes. *No holds barred. *No rules. *No mandatory gloves and combative uniform (bare-knuckle contest). *No judges' scores. *No time limits. *Knockout, tapout, or corner stoppage (indicated by towel) are the only determination methods. Referee could only halt a match pending the corner decision. McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, a place which elevation above sea level is one-mile high, has been chosen because Colorado had no athletic commission and thus no governing body from which they would need to get approval for bare-knuckle fighting. The arena hosted only two fight cards in its history, both of minor significance, occurring earlier in 1993.McNichols Sports Arena information at the Boxing's Official Record Keeper, BoxRec.com. The major accomplishment though for the promoters was to gather a celebrity commentary team for the event. The commentary team for the pay-per-view was Bill Wallace, Jim Brown, and Kathy Long, with additional analysis from Rod Machado and post-fight interviews by Brian Kilmeade. The ring announcer was Rich Goins. Jason DeLucia was an alternate for the event, having defeated Trent Jenkins in the alternate bout. However, as no fighter pulled out during the tournament, he was not called upon. History The tournament featured fights with no weight classes, rounds, or judges. The three rules, no biting, no eye gouging, and no groin shots were to be enforced only by a $1,500 fine. The match only ended by submission, knockout, or the fighter's corner throwing in the towel. Gloves were allowed, as Art Jimmerson showed in his quarterfinal bout against Royce Gracie, which he fought with one boxing glove. Royce Gracie won the tournament by defeating Gerard Gordeau via submission due to a rear naked choke. The referees for UFC 1 were Jo√£o Alberto Barreto and H√©lio Vigio, two veteran vale tudo referees from Brazil. Results UFC 1 bracket  Cultural significance  The event and its outcome catapulted Gracie Jiu-Jitsu to new heights in the United States and worldwide.

Although referred to as a framework, it works in a manner of a library. The collections framework provides both interfaces that define various collections and classes that implement them.  Differences to Arrays Collections and arrays are similar in that they both hold references to objects and they can be managed as a group. However, unlike arrays, collections do not need to be assigned a certain capacity when instantiated. Collections can also grow and shrink in size automatically when objects are added or removed. Collections cannot hold basic data type elements (primitive types) such as int, long, or double; instead, they hold Wrapper Classes such as Integer, Long, or Double. History Collection implementations in pre-JDK 1.2 versions of the Java platform included few data structure classes, but did not contain a collections framework. The standard methods for grouping Java objects were via the array, the Vector, and the Hashtable classes, which unfortunately were not easy to extend, and did not implement a standard member interface. To address the need for reusable collection data structures, several independent frameworks were developed, the most used being Doug Lea's Collections package, and ObjectSpace Generic Collection Library (JGL), whose main goal was consistency with the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). The collections framework was designed and developed primarily by Joshua Bloch, and was introduced in JDK 1.2. It reused many ideas and classes from Doug Lea's Collections package, which was deprecated as a result. Sun Microsystems chose not to use the ideas of JGL, because they wanted a compact framework, and consistency with C++ was not one of their goals. Doug Lea later developed a concurrency package, comprising new Collection-related classes. An updated version of these concurrency utilities was included in JDK 5.0 as of JSR 166. Architecture Almost all collections in Java are derived from the java.util.Collection interface. Collection defines the basic parts of all collections. The interface states the add() and remove() methods for adding to and removing from a collection respectively. Also required is the toArray() method, which converts the collection into a simple array of all the elements in the collection. Finally, the contains() method checks if a specified element is in the collection. The Collection interface is a subinterface of java.lang.Iterable, so any Collection may be the target of a for-each statement. (The Iterable interface provides the iterator() method used by for- each statements.) All collections have an iterator that goes through all of the elements in the collection. Additionally, Collection is a generic. Any collection can be written to store any class. For example, Collection can hold strings, and the elements from the collection can be used as strings without any casting required. Note that the angled brackets < > can hold a type argument that specifies which type the collection holds. = Three Types of Collection = There are three generic types of collection: ordered lists, dictionaries/maps, and sets. Ordered lists allows the programmer to insert items in a certain order and retrieve those items in the same order. An example is a waiting list. The base interfaces for ordered lists are called List and Queue. Dictionaries/Maps store references to objects with a lookup key to access the object's values. One example of a key is an identification card. The base interface for dictionaries/maps is called Map. Sets are unordered collections that can be iterated and contain each element at most once. The base interface for sets is called Set. =List interface= Lists are implemented in the collections framework via the java.util.List interface. It defines a list as essentially a more flexible version of an array. Elements have a specific order, and duplicate elements are allowed. Elements can be placed in a specific position. They can also be searched for within the list. Two examples for concrete classes that implement List are: *java.util.ArrayList, which implements the list as an array. Whenever functions specific to a list are required, the class moves the elements around within the array in order to do it. *java.util.LinkedList. This class stores the elements in nodes that each have a pointer to the previous and next nodes in the list. The list can be traversed by following the pointers, and elements can be added or removed simply by changing the pointers around to place the node in its proper place. =Stack class= Stacks are created using java.util.Stack. The stack offers methods to put a new object on the stack (method push()) and to get objects from the stack (method pop()). A stack returns the object according to last-in-first-out (LIFO), e.g. the object which was placed latest on the stack is returned first. java.util.Stack is a standard implementation of a stack provided by Java. The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class java.util.Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top. When a stack is first created, it contains no items. =Queue interfaces= The java.util.Queue interface defines the queue data structure, which stores elements in the order in which they are inserted. New additions go to the end of the line, and elements are removed from the front. It creates a first-in first-out system. This interface is implemented by java.util.LinkedList, java.util.ArrayDeque, and java.util.PriorityQueue. LinkedList, of course, also implements the List interface and can also be used as one. But it also has the Queue methods. ArrayDeque implements the queue as an array. Both LinkedList and ArrayDeque also implement the java.util.Deque interface, giving it more flexibility. java.util.Queue can be used more flexibly with its subinterface, java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue. The BlockingQueue interface works like a regular queue, but additions to and removals from the queue are blocking. If remove is called on an empty queue, it can be set to wait either a specified time or indefinitely for an item to appear in the queue. Similarly, adding an item is subject to an optional capacity restriction on the queue, and the method can wait for space to become available in the queue before returning. java.util.PriorityQueue implements java.util.Queue, but also alters it. Instead of elements being ordered in the order in which they are inserted, they are ordered by priority. The method used to determine priority is either the compareTo() method in the elements or a method given in the constructor. The class creates this by using a heap to keep the items sorted. =Double-ended queue (deque) interfaces= The java.util.Queue interface is expanded by the java.util.Deque subinterface. Deque creates a double-ended queue. While a regular queue only allows insertions at the rear and removals at the front, the deque allows insertions or removals to take place both at the front and the back. A deque is like a queue that can be used forwards or backwards, or both at once. Additionally, both a forwards and a backwards iterator can be generated. The Deque interface is implemented by java.util.ArrayDeque and java.util.LinkedList. The java.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque interface works similarly to java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue. The same methods for insertion and removal with time limits for waiting for the insertion or removal to become possible are provided. However, the interface also provides the flexibility of a deque. Insertions and removals can take place at both ends. The blocking function is combined with the deque function. =Set interfaces= Java's java.util.Set interface defines the set. A set can't have any duplicate elements in it. Additionally, the set has no set order. As such, elements can't be found by index. Set is implemented by java.util.HashSet, java.util.LinkedHashSet, and java.util.TreeSet. HashSet uses a hash table. More specifically, it uses a java.util.HashMap to store the hashes and elements and to prevent duplicates. java.util.LinkedHashSet extends this by creating a doubly linked list that links all of the elements by their insertion order. This ensures that the iteration order over the set is predictable. java.util.TreeSet uses a red- black tree implemented by a java.util.TreeMap. The red-black tree makes sure that there are no duplicates. Additionally, it allows TreeSet to implement java.util.SortedSet. The java.util.Set interface is extended by the java.util.SortedSet interface. Unlike a regular set, the elements in a sorted set are sorted, either by the element's compareTo() method, or a method provided to the constructor of the sorted set. The first and last elements of the sorted set can be retrieved, and subsets can be created via minimum and maximum values, as well as beginning or ending at the beginning or ending of the sorted set. The SortedSet interface is implemented by java.util.TreeSet. java.util.SortedSet is extended further via the java.util.NavigableSet interface. It's similar to SortedSet, but there are a few additional methods. The floor(), ceiling(), lower(), and higher() methods find an element in the set that's close to the parameter. Additionally, a descending iterator over the items in the set is provided. As with SortedSet, java.util.TreeSet implements NavigableSet. =Map interfaces= Maps are defined by the java.util.Map interface in Java. Maps are simple data structures that associate a key with an element. This lets the map be very flexible. If the key is the hash code of the element, the map is essentially a set. If it's just an increasing number, it becomes a list. Maps are implemented by java.util.HashMap, java.util.LinkedHashMap, and java.util.TreeMap. HashMap uses a hash table. The hashes of the keys are used to find the elements in various buckets. LinkedHashMap extends this by creating a doubly linked list between the elements, allowing them to be accessed in the order in which they were inserted into the map. TreeMap, in contrast to HashMap and LinkedHashMap, uses a red-black tree. The keys are used as the values for the nodes in the tree, and the nodes point to the elements in the map. The java.util.Map interface is extended by its subinterface, java.util.SortedMap. This interface defines a map that's sorted by the keys provided. Using, once again, the compareTo() method or a method provided in the constructor to the sorted map, the key-element pairs are sorted by the keys. The first and last keys in the map can be called. Additionally, submaps can be created from minimum and maximum keys. SortedMap is implemented by java.util.TreeMap. The java.util.NavigableMap interface extends java.util.SortedMap in various ways. Methods can be called that find the key or map entry that's closest to the given key in either direction. The map can also be reversed, and an iterator in reverse order can be generated from it. It's implemented by java.util.TreeMap. Extensions to the Java collections framework Java collections framework is extended by the Apache Commons Collections library, which adds collection types such as a bag and bidirectional map, as well as utilities for creating unions and intersections. Google has released its own collections libraries as part of the guava libraries.

Founded in Toronto, Ontario as a music school in 1981, the band has become one of the most successful Canadian reggae ensembles. They signed with the Canadian record label Solid Gold Records early in their career and have been with them ever since. Their style has been described as a radio-friendly combination of lover's rock and dancehall. History Jo Jo Bennett and Fergus Hambleton, the first members of the Sattalites, met while touring with reggae singer Afreen and the pair began performing together, mixing Bennett's instrumentals with Hambleton's smooth alto voice to create the Sattalites' sound. The band started as a teaching group who opened the Sattalites Music School on a pay-what-you-can basis to spread their influence in 1981. The Sattalites consisted of various types of students from the school who wanted a sense of live performing. By 1982, the Sattalites had melded into a collaboration of musicians from talented beginners to experienced pros, some of whom still perform. They became very well known for their enthusiastic live performances which initiated their extensive touring across Canada and the United States. It was the only Canadian band ever invited to play at Jamaica's \\"Sunsplash\\", playing before 25,000 people, and they also performed at the 1993/94 World Skiing Championship in Whistler, British Columbia. As two-time Juno winners, the Sattalites are one of Canada's longest standing reggae groups. Members Fergus Hambleton has been the lead vocalist of the Sattalites since the band's beginning. He also plays the guitar, alto saxophone and the keyboard and has played in other bands including A Passing Fancy and the Ginger Group. Vocalist Jo Jo Bennett, a founding member of the group, also plays the flugelhorn and percussion. The other five members are David Fowler (keyboards), Bruce McGillivray (bass), Junior McPherson (drums and percussion), Rick Morrison (saxophone) and Bruce Robinson (piano and vocals). During the 1980s and 1990s, Felix Taylor played trombone and sang background vocals. Neil Chapman also played lead guitar on many of their recordings as well live on stage.

One of the last of the so-called \\"Treaty Cruisers,\\" she was considered one of the best designs commissioned by any of the naval powers. Design and description Alg√©rie was built in response to the Italian heavy cruisers that were more heavily armoured than the preceding and was designed to take advantage of lighter propulsion machinery to improve her armour protection. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced at standard load and at deep load. The hull was divided by 16 bulkheads into 17 watertight compartments. The ship's crew consisted of 746 men as a flagship.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 110, 113 Service history Alg√©rie started World War II as flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron which also included the cruisers , , , , and destroyers from the 5th, 7th and 9th contre- torpilleur divisions. Alg√©rie, Dupleix, the battleship and the British aircraft carrier were based in Dakar in French West Africa, while searching for the German heavy cruiser . In March 1940, after refitting at Toulon, she accompanied the battleship to Canada, with 3,000 cases of French gold. In April, Alg√©rie returned to the Mediterranean and when Italy declared war on France, she helped shell Genoa in June. Her last mission before the French surrender was as a convoy escort. After the French defeat in 1940, Alg√©rie remained with the Vichy fleet based at Toulon. Her only mission for the Vichy navy was to escort the battleship back to Toulon, as the battleship had been summarily repaired after the damages received during the British attack on Mers-el-K√©bir in 1940. In 1941, her secondary and anti-aircraft weaponry was strengthened and in 1942, she was fitted with the early French-built radar. She was still there when the Germans invaded the so-called \\"Free Zone\\" on 27 November 1942. She was among the ships scuttled in the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon. Demolition charges were set on the ship. The Germans tried to persuade her crew that scuttling was not permitted by Armistice provisions; her captain requested the Germans to wait until his superior could advise, as the fuses were lit. When Admiral Lacroix finally arrived, he ordered the ship evacuated; as the Germans were preparing to board, he told them that the cruiser was about to explode. She was blown up and burned for 20 days. The Italians raised her in sections on 18 March 1943. The remains were bombed and sunk again on 7 March 1944, and were finally raised and broken up for scrap in 1949.Warship International, No. 3, 1997, p. 310.

These capitals are typically dated to the first centuries of the Common Era, and constitute an important aspect of Greco-Buddhist art. Corinthian design Indo-Corinthian capitals display a design and foliage structure which is derived from the academic Corinthian capital developed in Greece. Its importation to India followed the road of Hellenistic expansion in the East in the centuries after the conquests of Alexander the Great. In particular the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, centered on Bactria (today's northern Afghanistan), upheld the type at the doorstep of India, in such places as Ai-Khanoum until the end of the 2nd century BCE. In India, the design was often adapted, usually taking a more elongated form and sometimes being combined with scrolls, generally within the context of Buddhist stupas and temples. Figurines Figure of the Buddha, within a Corinthian capital, Gandhara, Jamal Garhi. Indo-Corinthian capitals also incorporated figures of the Buddha or Bodhisattvas, usually as central figures surrounded by, and often under the shade of, the luxurious foliage of Corinthian designs. This practice was not limited to India, and also found favor in various areas of Central Asia. The depiction of figurines within the foliage of Corinthian capitals is not in itself an eastern development. In the ancient Greek world in the Mediterranean, figurines were often represented this way: Combinations with Buddhist architecture Indo-Corinthian capital were also used in combination with architectural elements, such as Buddhist stupas. One of the best example was excavated and reconstituted at Sirkap. > Perhaps the most notable divergence from the western concept of function > occurs at Kalawan, Taxila, where a large acanthus capital set on a lotus > base was inserted between the conventional square basement and cylindrical > dome of a votive stupa. Further, in the art of Gandhara, Indo-Corinthian capitals on top of separating pilasters are used extensively in narrative friezes of the life of the Buddha. This usage continued as late as the 5th century.

It became technically feasible in the mid 1970s, but was rapidly superseded by cellular networks in the early 1980s, so it is rarely found today. It was invented by engineer J. T. Murasko of UK radiotelephone manufacturer Dymar Electronics. The principle of operation is to precisely control the transmission frequency so accurately that interference between adjacent transmitters is kept under control, with a beat frequency of about 10-15 hertz only. While this creates some audible affects in the receiver in the overlap region, it is usually tolerable and doesn't affect the intelligibility of the signal. Narrowband Frequency modulation is used exclusively, so that the capture effect will select the stronger of two transmitters wherever one predominates. While frequency control down to 1-2 hertz accuracy is achievable, this is undesirable, since the cancellation of signals would wipe out the signal at the receiver for up to a second. The deliberate offset prevents this at the expense of a \\"motorboating\\" effect. Transmitters use highly stable crystal ovens as their primary oscillator and frequency synthesisers to generate multiple channels from this.

During summer, all over the alpine regions cattle herds feed on alpine pastures (Almen in Austria or Germany, Alpen in Switzerland) high up in the mountains, a practice known as transhumance. In numbers, these amount to about 500,000 in Austria, 380,000 in Switzerland, and 50,000 in Germany. While there is often some movement of cattle between the Almen (sing.: Alm), or Alpen (sing.: Alp) respectively, during the summer, there is usually one concerted cattle drive in the autumn to bring the cattle to their barns down in the valley. If there were no accidents on the Alm during the summer, in many areas the cattle are decorated elaborately, and the cattle drive is celebrated with music, feasts and dance events in the towns and villages. Upon arrival in the valley, joint herds from multiple farmers are sorted in the Viehscheid, and each animal is returned to its owner. In many places this Alpine custom of Almabtrieb has today evolved into a major tourist attraction, with a public festival, and booths set up along the course for selling agricultural, as well as artisans', products along with alcoholic beverages. In the spring, the reverse cattle drive moves from the valley barns to the Alp (in Switzerland: Alpaufzug, Alpfahrt, Alpauffahrt; in Germany/Austria: Almauftrieb).

He served as Speaker of the House from 1962 to 1965 for the Tom Playford LCL government and 1968 to 1970 for the Steele Hall LCL government, both times in exchange for his confidence and supply vote to form minority governments. Early life Born in Norwood, South Australia, Stott completed primary school and began working for his father on their 2225 hectare wheat farm near Mindarie, in the Murray Mallee region of South Australia, while continuing his education through Workers Educational Association of South Australia (WEA) classes and extensive reading. Political career Stott showed great interest in the problems facing his fellow wheat farmers and joined the newly formed Country Party in 1920. As President of his local branch, Stott began to raise his profile around the electorate and in farming circles, helping to found the Farmers Protection Association in 1929, the South Australian Wheatgrowers Protection Association (SAWPA) in 1930 and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation (AWF) in 1931. He was also appointed General Secretary of each of these organisations. Stott was considering seeking Country Party preselection for his local Electoral district of Albert at the 1933 election when it was announced that the Country Party would merge with the urban based Liberal Federation to form the Liberal and Country League (LCL). He opposed the move, fearing both that the rural prerogative of the Country Party would be diminished and that his preselection may become more difficult. His fears were partly realised when he lost LCL pre-selection; Stott promptly resigned from the party to run as an independent. Stott was given little chance of winning. However, his standing within the influential wheat farming community in Albert, his Masonic connections, and his vocal opposition to the Country Party/Liberal Federation merger led to his election. He soon proved to be a thorn in the side of the newly elected LCL government of Richard Layton Butler, being dubbed the \\"Farmer's Champion\\" due to his vocal support of Great Depression affected farmers. Given that the state's ALP remained ineffective and torn by internecine feuding after Lionel Hill's unpopular premiership, Stott was considered by the LCL to be \\"a greater nuisance than the whole of the Opposition put together\\". Upon his election in 1933, Stott was forced to resign from his Secretariat position with SAWPA; but he retained his role with the AWF. He also helped found the Primary Producers Council of Australia (the antecedent of the National Farmers' Federation) in 1934 and continued to play a leading role within that organisation. This influence within these important primary industry bodies allowed Stott to build a power base for himself that assisted with his continued re-election over the next three decades. In addition to his parliamentary work on rural issues, such as successfully introducing legislation to secure a (high) stable price for wheat and to enable bulk handling of grain, Stott also proved himself to be adept at championing prickly social issues, including introducing a successful Private Member's Bill to reduce the period a divorce could be granted in the case of desertion from five to three years. This success led the government to approach Stott to introduce other controversial social issue legislation that the LCL supported but did not want to introduce. The public recognised this, and many people who approached Stott for assistance were not in his electorate. Stott was comfortably re-elected at the 1938 South Australian election in the newly formed Electoral district of Ridley (following the division of Albert into two single electoral districts). He was one of 14 independents in the chamber. The independents as a grouping won 40 percent of the primary vote, more than either of the major parties. Stott was the de facto leader of the independent caucus within parliament. The incumbent LCL government only held 15 of 39 seats, which led to uncertainty over which party, if any, could form government. This confusion led Stott, as the most experienced and famous of the Independent MPs, to believe that he could become Premier of South Australia himself. He failed to gain the support of sufficient independents and LCL members to achieve this; but the LCL government was forced to rely on his support far more than its members would have liked. The commencement of World War II led Stott to argue that the forthcoming 1941 election should be cancelled and an LCL/ALP/Independent coalition government instigated (perhaps with himself in a prominent position) to concentrate on fighting the war. He failed to gain support for this plan, and the election went ahead, with Stott easily retaining his seat. So great a reputation did he have as the friend of primary industry, that he was sometimes called the \\"Christ of the Mallee\\" where, it was written, \\"few would have glanced if he had walked on water\\". Following the 1941 election, Premier Tom Playford approached Stott and recommended that the latter join the LCL. While Stott refused to do so, he remained a fervent admirer of Playford, and publicly praised the Premier wherever possible. In return, Playford sought to persuade the local LCL branch to refrain from running a candidate of its own against Stott in his constituency for successive elections. When the local LCL branch finally refused Playford's request, he apologised profusely to Stott and did little to support the candidate of his own party. Stott's continued electoral success cannot purely be credited to his influence within bodies like the AWF. For years he was also heavily involved with the wine and citrus industries and helped get producers in both industries significant government concessions. He was renowned for his in-depth knowledge of any issue he debated, which he achieved through prodigious research. His wife Linda, whom he married in 1926, was also a shrewd political campaigner who was heavily involved in issues around the electorate and proved a great asset for Stott. Perhaps however, his greatest asset was his reputation as a tireless campaigner who never gave up on a constituent issue; in one case Stott spent over twenty years arguing with government departments on behalf of constituents seeking to be connected to the water supply before his eventual success. Taking into account his public persona as a man with a square jaw, resonant voice and great presence who drank, smoked and owned and wagered on horses (Stott would serve as President of the South Australian Racehorse Owners' Association), and who was not afraid of condemnation by the churches for this lifestyle, Stott retained statewide popularity throughout his tenure in parliament. The 1962 election resulted in a hung parliament whereby the LCL and Labor each held 19 seats. By this time, Stott was the only independent in the chamber, and he was now in a position where he could effectively choose the next Premier. The leading ALP figures were initially hopeful of convincing Stott to support them in government (which would have made Frank Walsh the new Premier), but Playford praised Stott for his long service to South Australia. Stott threw his support to Playford, referring to him as the greatest Premier in history. Labor resigned itself to another three years in opposition. In return for his support, Playford named Stott the Speaker of the House, ensuring that Stott had the casting vote on any contentious legislation ‚Äî a vote that he used almost without fail to support the LCL. Stott lost the speakership following the 1965 election, which the ALP won. Nevertheless he regained it (and the balance of power) in 1968 when the LCL, under Steele Hall, returned to power. The government, being reliant on Stott's support, always welcomed his suggestions and when Stott recommended the construction of a dam at Chowilla (within his electorate), the LCL initially readily agreed. However, Hall believed the proposed dam would be an expensive white elephant and refused to fund the dam. Protests in Ridley forced Stott to vote with the Opposition to defeat Hall's government, leading to the return of Don Dunstan as Premier, something that Stott had fervently worked against for the previous decade. Later life Following his retirement at the 1970 election Stott lent his expertise to the Country Party as an organiser and campaign director and died in 1976, still angry with Steele Hall over Chowilla Dam. The Stott Highway was named in 2008 in his honour as it passes through his former electoral districts and near his farm.  References  * *Barnacles and Parasites, R.

He was a member for the Division of Franklin in the Tasmanian House of Assembly from the 2002 state election until his resignation in January 2020. He became premier following the 2014 state election, having been Leader of the Opposition since 2006. He was re- elected to a second term in government following victory in the 2018 state election. In March 2018, he succeeded Angus Bethune as the longest-serving leader in the history of the Tasmanian Liberals. He resigned as the Premier of Tasmania, the Leader of the Tasmanian Liberals and Member of the Parliament of Tasmania on 20 January 2020. In April 2020, Hodgman was appointed as the chair of Australian Business Growth Fund by federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. Hodgman is from Hobart and was educated at the University of Tasmania. Hodgman's father, uncle, and grandfather also served in the Parliament of Tasmania. Early life and education Hodgman was born in April 1969, the son of former Liberal parliamentarian Michael Hodgman. His uncle, Peter, was also a Member of the Tasmanian Parliament, and his paternal grandfather, Bill Hodgman, was a member of both Houses of the Tasmanian Parliament, ending his career as President of the Legislative Council. He was educated at The Hutchins School and the University of Tasmania, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws in 1993, and a Graduate Certificate in Legal Practice in 1994. He is married to Nicola, and the couple have two sons, William and James, and a daughter, Lily. Legal career Hodgman was admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor in 1994. He was an associate of the Hobart law firm Wallace Wilkinson & Webster, before practising as a solicitor for the Wiltshire County Council in the United Kingdom for 15 months. In the United Kingdom he acted as prosecutor and advocate for the Council in the County Courts and the High Court of Justice. He then returned to Wallace Wilkinson & Webster in 1998, and practised in criminal law and personal injuries until his election to Parliament. Political career Hodgman entered Parliament at the 2002 election in the electorate of Franklin and was elected to the role of deputy leader immediately afterwards. He was elected alongside his father, who was elected in the neighbouring seat of Denison. Hodgman was re-elected in the 2006 election receiving 21.98 per cent of first preferences, an increase compared to his previous vote of 12.37 per cent in the 2002 election. This is the third highest individual vote ever recorded in the seat of Franklin. On 30 March 2006 he was unanimously elected as the leader of Tasmania's Liberal Party, replacing Rene Hidding following disappointing results at the 2006 election. Jeremy Rockliff is his deputy. At the 2018 election Hodgman personally received 27,184 first preference votes, the highest number ever for any candidate in a state election in Tasmania. Hodgman is Tasmania's seventh longest serving Premier. As well as serving as Premier, Hodgman has been Tasmania's Attorney General, Minister for Justice, Minister for Tourism, Hospitality and Events, Minister for Trade, Minister for Parks, Minister for Heritage, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sport and Recreation, Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence and Minister for Advanced Manufacturing and Defence Industries. Hodgman has held a number of shadow portfolios in his parliamentary career, including Treasury and Finance, Energy, Major Projects and Community Development, Tourism, Economic Development and the Arts. = 2010 election = Hodgman contested the 2010 Tasmanian state election and the result was a hung parliament, with the Liberals and Labor on 10 seats each. The balance of power rested with the Tasmanian Greens, who won five seats. Before the election, the incumbent Premier David Bartlett stated that the party who won the most votes should form government. Since the Liberals won the popular vote by just over 6,700 votes, Bartlett and his caucus voted to give up power, and Bartlett advised the Governor of Tasmania, Peter Underwood, to invite Hodgman to form a government. However, Hodgman never approached the Greens before the writs were returned, and Bartlett did not promise a Hodgman minority government would have a minimum period of support. Faced with the prospect of a government being defeated at its first sitting, Underwood recommissioned Bartlett as premier and left it to the Assembly to determine whether Labor had enough support to govern.Green, Antony. 2014 Tasmanian election preview. ABC News, 2014-01-17. Hodgman accused Bartlett of going back on a promise not to topple a Liberal minority government. See also = 2014 election = Before the 2014 Tasmanian state election, with polls suggesting the Liberals were positioned to win government, Hodgman had promised that he would only govern in majority. ABC News election analyst Antony Green suggested Hodgman's promise could have come back to haunt him if the Palmer United Party, which made a significant effort in the election, were to siphon off enough votes to deny the Liberals a majority. On election night, Hodgman led the Liberal Party to victory with a swing of over 9% against the incumbent Labor Party. The Liberals picked up an additional seat in every electorate except Denison, assuring that Hodgman would have a secure majority. They ultimately went on to win 15 seats‚Äìa comprehensive victory under current Tasmanian electoral practice. Hodgman himself topped the poll in Franklin, tallying 23,589 first preference votes on 35 percent of the first preference vote; the total number of electors in Franklin is 74,189. This result was achieved despite competing against both Giddings and Greens leader Nick McKim in this multi-member electorate. Hodgman was sworn in as the 45th Premier of Tasmania, alongside the members of his cabinet, on 31 March 2014, becoming only the fifth non- Labor premier in 80 years and only the third to govern in majority. = 2018 election = Hodgman dissolved the parliament and called the election for March 3. Repeating his vow of four years earlier, Hodgman categorically ruled out governing in coalition or minority, saying, \\"We will govern alone or not at all.\\" However it was thought unlikely at the time that the Liberals would keep their majority due to the strong polling of the Greens and the Jacqui Lambie Network. During the campaign, Hodgman and the Liberals promised to keep poker machines in pubs and clubs. He claimed 5000 jobs were at risk if machines were banned, although fact checkers called this claim overblown. It was later disclosed that the gambling industry funded his campaign with over $400,000, although the true amount was speculated to be far higher.http://andrewwilkie.org/dirty-money/ The day before the election it was revealed that the Liberals had privately indicated to farming stakeholders they might relax the state's gun laws. The move was criticised by some opponents. Ultimately, the Liberals suffered a swing of two seats, leaving them at 13 seats, just enough for a majority. It was only the second time in 87 years that the non-Labor forces in Tasmania had been reelected with an outright majority. Hodgman personally received 27,184 first preference votes, which is the highest number ever in a Tasmanian state election. Hodgman is one of the few Australian state politicians to have never spent a day on the backbench. He has spent his entire tenure in the House of Assembly in a leadership position as deputy opposition leader (2002‚Äì2006), opposition leader (2006‚Äì2014) and premier (2014‚Äìpresent). On 14 January 2020, Hodgman announced his resignation as premier, and confirmed he would also resign from state parliament. In his resignation speech, he cited the toll on his family; his 17 years in the legislature had been concurrent with the \\"entire lives\\" of his three children.> On 20 January, Treasurer Peter Gutwein was elected unopposed as Liberal leader, and was sworn in as premier later that day. Prior to his resignation there was speculation that Hodgman would stay on as premier to surpass Robin Gray as the state's longest serving Liberal Premier.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-14/will-hodgman-resigns-as- tasmanian-premier/11867736 = Career after politics = On 15 April 2020 Hodgman was announced as the inaugural chair of the new Australian Business Growth Fund.

Life  Br√ºll received his rabbinic-Talmudic education from his father, Jakob Br√ºll (de), who combined wide Talmudic knowledge with acute historical perception. He then studied classical and Oriental languages and history at the University of Vienna, having at the same time a good opportunity to continue his Talmudic studies at the Vienna bet ha-Midrash, then under the direction of men like I. H. Weiss, M. Friedmann, and Adolf Jellinek. Here, too, Br√ºll, the son of a conservative rabbi, and the grandson of the arch- Orthodox chief rabbi of Moravia, Nahum Trebitsch, developed into a decided Reformer and a disciple of Abraham Geiger. Br√ºll was called as rabbi to Bzenec, one of the Reform communities of Moravia, an office that be resigned in 1870 in order to take charge of the rabbinate of Frankfurt am Main. He owed this appointment to Geiger, who drew the attention of his native community to the young Moravian rabbi. Br√ºll remained with this ancient community until his death, although his position was fraught with disappointment. As a result of the movement inaugurated by Samson Raphael Hirsch at Frankfurt, even the circles that were not Orthodox tended gradually toward the conservative party. Br√ºll cared as little for compromise as did his opponent Hirsch. An enthusiastic representative of the Reform movement, for religious as well as scientific reasons, he was decidedly opposed to any attempts at reconciliation between Reform and Orthodoxy. Yet he was not the man to influence the masses: his sermons, less effective from the pulpit, had to be read in order to be appreciated. Not until he saw that all his efforts were in vain, and he had been personally attacked, did he retire to devote himself to his studies, greatly to the honor and advantage of Jewish learning.  Br√ºll's scholarly importance  Br√ºll's researches ranged over almost all the branches of Jewish science, including Bible exegesis and grammar, Jewish history and literature, the Apocrypha, Biblical Halakah, casuistics, responsa, general history, philology, poetry, Jewish-German literature; and he contributed to all these by original investigation. Adolf Jellinek says of Br√ºll: His range of reading in Jewish literature was hardly paralleled, and he evinced a peculiar acumen found in no other scholar of modern times (in Adolf Br√ºll's Monatsbl√§tter, xi. 50).  Books  Br√ºll collected the results of his scholarship in the ten volumes of his Jahrb√ºcher (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1874‚Äì90). He contributed almost the entire material to these Jahrb√ºcher‚Äîthe longer and shorter essays as well as the numerous criticisms on new books. Many of these essays have also been printed separately. = Bible = * Beitr√§ge zur Erkl√§rung des Buches Hosea (Jahrb. v.-vi. 1-62) * Historische Basis des Buches Ruth (v.-vi. 63-70) * Das Apokryphische Susannabuch (iii. 1-69) * Die Epistolischen Apokryphen und die Apokryphischen Zus√§tze zum Buche Daniel. = Talmud = * Die Talmudischen Tractate √ºber Trauer um Verstorbene (i. 1-57) * Fremdsprachliche W√∂rter in den Talmuden und Midraschim (i. 123-210) * Die Entstehungsgeschichte des Babylonischen Talmuds als Schriftwerkes (ii. 1-123) * Verschollene Baraitas und Midraschim (ii. 124-133) * Entstehung und Urspr√ºnglicher Inhalt des Tractates Abot (vii. 1-17) * Eingeschaltete Partien im Babylonischen Talmud (viii. 59-60). = History = * Adiabene (i. 58-86) * Das Geschlecht der Treves (i. 87-122) * Die Polemik f√ºr und gegen Maimuni im Dreizehnten Jahrhundert (iv. 1-33) * Zur Gesch. der J√ºdisch-Ethischen Literatur des Mittelalters (v.-vi. 71-93) * Spr√ºchw√∂rter in der Nachtalmudischen Literatur des Judenthums (vii. 18-30).  Bibliographical works  Br√ºll's range of reading and critical insight constituted him an important reviewer of new books in the field of Jewish science. His Jahrb√ºcher contain 183 reviews, all of which illuminate more or less the subjects with which they deal. In 1890 Br√ºll undertook a continuation of the Hebr√§ische Bibliographie, edited by Moritz Steinschneider, under the title Central- Anzeiger f√ºr J√ºdische Literatur; but only one volume appeared (Frankfurt am Main, 1891), as the undertaking was cut short by Br√ºll's death. At the instance of Steinschneider, the Zunz-Stiftung had commissioned Br√ºll to add a supplement to Leopold Zunz's Gottesdienstliche Vortr√§ge, the basic work of modern Jewish science. Steinschneider remarked in his preface to the second edition of the work in question (xvi.): \\"Dr. Br√ºll appeared to me to possess the rare combination of ability and leisure, zeal and perseverance, requisite for editing such a supplement.'\\" Br√ºll had intended to devote his whole scholarship to this undertaking. The scattered notes that were found in his papers after his death were in part incorporated in the second edition of the Gottesdienstliche Vortr√§ge (ib. 1892). Br√ºll was among the few German scholars who also wrote in Hebrew, as may be seen by his many contributions to the Hebrew periodicals Bet-Talmud, Bet ha-Midrash, Ha-Karmel, and O·∫ìar ha-Sifrut. Of these, Toledot Shabbethai ·∫íebi (Wilna, 1879) and Ner la-Maor, a biography of Aaron Worms, in Ozar ha-Sifrut, ii. 20-31, deserve special mention. Br√ºll also printed his sermons (1869) and addresses (1878). Grabreden (Frankfort-on- the-Main, 1895) and Trauungsreden (ib. 1891) were published posthumously.

The software life cycle is typically divided up into stages going from abstract descriptions of the problem to designs then to code and testing and finally to deployment. Modeling is done at the beginning of the process. The reasons to model a system before writing the code are: *Communication. Users typically cannot understand programming language or code. Model diagrams can be more understandable and can allow users to give developers feedback on the appropriate structure of the system. A key goal of the Object-Oriented approach is to decrease the \\"semantic gap\\" between the system and the real world by using terminology that is the same as the functions that users perform. Modeling is an essential tool to facilitate achieving this goal . *Abstraction. A goal of most software methodologies is to first address \\"what\\" questions and then address \\"how\\" questions. I.e., first determine the functionality the system is to provide without consideration of implementation constraints and then consider how to take this abstract description and refine it into an implementable design and code given constraints such as technology and budget. Modeling enables this by allowing abstract descriptions of processes and objects that define their essential structure and behavior.

He was born in Smiths Clove, Orange County, New York in 1774. He was the son of Philip Roblin, a United Empire Loyalist, and Elizabeth Miller. After the American Revolution, his family settled in Adolphustown Township. He was elected to the 5th Parliament of Upper Canada for Lennox and Addington. He was unseated in 1810 because he was felt to be unfit to serve because he was a Methodist lay preacher. This may have been only an excuse, since he was a Reformer and so not acceptable to the Family Compact. His constituency re-electing him, his seat was again declared vacant by the same party and for the same reason. Returning home, he was elected for the third time; but he died before the next session commenced, and thus evaded that which threatened to become a serious cause of dissatisfaction, if not of disturbance. He died in Adolphustown in 1813. His son David and his nephew, John Philip Roblin later became members of the Legislative Assembly.

The Super-consciousness includes the whole of the consciousness above the waking-consciousness, like dreams, visions, inspirations, etc. To bring the super-consciousness into manifestation on the physical plane, Besant proposes (in the early stages) to render the brain and sense-organs unresponsive to physical impacts and to induce Trance. This can be done by using the methods of Yogis. But she also says that there is a difference between the super-physical conditions of consciousness in the hypnotised subject and in the Yogi.

Niva illustration The Courri√®res mine disaster, Europe's worst mining accident, caused the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906. This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on 26 April 1942, which killed 1,549 miners. A coaldust explosion, the cause of which is not known with certainty, devastated a coal mine operated by the Compagnie des mines de houille de Courri√®res. Victims lived nearby in the villages of M√©ricourt (404 people killed), Sallaumines (304 killed), Billy-Montigny (114 people killed), and Noyelles-sous-Lens (102 people killed). The mine was 2 km (1 mi) to the east of Lens, in the Pas-de- Calais d√©partement (about 220 km, or 140 miles, north of Paris). A large explosion was heard shortly after 06:30 on the morning of Saturday 10 March 1906. An elevator cage at Shaft 3 was thrown to the surface, damaging the pit- head; windows and roofs were blown out on the surface at Shaft 4; an elevator cage raised at Shaft 2 contained only dead or unconscious miners.  Initial cause  It is generally agreed that the majority of the deaths and destruction were caused by an explosion of coal dust which swept through the mine. However it has never been ascertained what caused the initial ignition of the coal dust. Two main causes have been hypothesized: * An accident during the handling of mining explosives. * Ignition of methane by the naked flame of a miner's lamp. There is evidence favoring both these hypotheses. Blasting was being done in the area believed to be the source of the explosion, after initial attempts to widen a gallery had been abandoned the previous day for lack of success. Many workers in the mine used lamps with naked flames (as opposed to the more expensive Davy lamps), despite the risk of gas explosions. As Monsieur Delafond, General Inspector of Mines, put it in his report:  Rescue attempts  Guglielminetti-Drager breathing apparatus (front) Rescue attempts began quickly on the morning of the disaster, but were hampered by the lack of trained mine rescuers in France at that time, and by the scale of the disaster: some two-thirds of the miners in the mine at the time of the explosion perished, while many survivors suffered from the effects of gas inhalation. Expert teams from Paris and from Germany arrived at the scene on 12 March. The first funerals occurred on 13 March, during an unseasonal snowstorm; 15,000 people attended. The funerals were a focus for the anger of the mining communities against the companies which owned the concessions, and the first strikes started the next day in the Courri√®res area, extending quickly to other areas in the d√©partements of the Pas-de-Calais and the Nord. The slow progress of the rescue exacerbated the tensions between the mining communities and the companies. By 1 April only 194 bodies had been brought to the surface. There were many accusations that the Compagnie des mines de Courri√®res was deliberately delaying the reopening of blocked shafts to prevent coalface fires (and hence to save the coal seams): more recent studies tend to consider such claims as exaggerated. The mine was unusually complex for its time, with the different pitheads being interconnected by underground galleries on multiple levels. Such complexity was intended to facilitate access for rescuers in the case of an accident‚Äîit also helped the coal to be brought to the surface‚Äîbut it contributed to the large loss of life by allowing the dust explosion to travel further and then by increasing the debris which had to be cleared by the rescuers. About 110 km (70 mi) of tunnel are believed to have been affected by the explosion. G√©rard Dumont of the Centre historique minier de Lewarde has shown that the plans of the mine existing at the time of the accident were difficult to interpret: some measured the depth of galleries by reference to the minehead, others by reference to sea level.  Survivors  About 500 miners were able to reach the surface during the hours immediately after the explosion. Many were severely burned and suffering from the effects of mine gases. A group of thirteen survivors, known later as the rescap√©s, was found by rescuers on 30 March, twenty days after the explosion. They had survived at first by eating bark from the crossbeams, later by eating a rotting mine horse. They avoided dehydration by drinking the water dripping from the walls. The two eldest (39 and 40 years old) were awarded the L√©gion d'honneur, the other eleven (including three younger than 18 years of age) received the M√©daille d'or du courage. A final survivor was found on 4 April.  Public response  The disaster at the Courri√®res mine was one of the first in France to be reported on a large scale by the media of the day. The Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881 had specified the basis for a (relative) freedom of the press, and Lille, the regional capital less than 40 km (25 mi) away, had at least five daily newspapers whose reporters engaged in a fierce competition for news from the mine. Photographs could not then be published in newspapers for technical reasons, but were widely distributed as postcards; on average, each French resident sent fifteen postcards during 1906. A postcard of the thirteen rescap√©s was available nine days after their discovery.The postcard, postmarked 1906-04-08, is in the archives of the Centre historique minier de Lewarde. The first public appeal for funds to help the victims and their families was established the day after the explosion by Le R√©veil du Nord, a Lille daily newspaper. In the newspaper L'Humanit√© of the next day, socialist and pacifist politician Jean Jaur√®s wrote: > It is a call for social justice that comes to the nation's representants > from the depths of the burning mines. It is the harsh and suffering destiny > of work that, once more, manifests itself to all. And would political action > be something else than the sad game of ambitions and vanities if it didn't > propose to itself the liberation of the workers' people, the organisation of > a better life for those who work? Such appeals became widespread, and were supplemented by the sale of special collections of postcards depicting the disaster. The different appeals were eventually subsumed by an official fund‚Äîitself established by a law enacted only four days after the explosion‚Äîand a total of 750,000 francs was raised. This at a time when the daily wage for a miner (a well-paid job compared to other manual work) was less than six francs. Over half the total was contributed by the Compagnie des mines de houille de Courri√®res and by the Comit√© central des houilli√®res de France (Central Committee of French Coal Mines, an employers' association). On 18 March, a strike was publicized and quickly extended itself to the entire region. Minister of Interior Georges Clemenceau visited the region twice, but \\"no promises were kept\\", according to L'Humanit√©. Clemenceau's first visit was filled with optimism and ex-president Jean Casimir-Perier stated that \\"I have the strongest hope that our discussion... will lead to an understanding which is desirable for all.\\" However, the following day the strikers rejected the concessions offered by the mining companies and the number of strikers reached 46,000.

It follows the repercussions of a drunken one-night stand between a slacker and a just-promoted media personality that results in an unintended pregnancy. The film was released on June 1, 2007 to box office success, grossing $219 million worldwide, and acclaim from critics. A spin-off sequel, This Is 40, was released in 2012. Plot Alison Scott is a career- minded woman, who has just been given an on-air role with E! and is living in the pool house with her sister Debbie's family. Ben Stone is laid-back and sardonic. He lives off funds received in compensation for an injury and sporadically works on a celebrity porn website with his roommates, in between smoking marijuana or going to theme parks such as Knott's Berry Farm. While celebrating her promotion, Alison meets Ben at a local nightclub. After a night of drinking, they end up having sex. Due to a misunderstanding, they don't use protection: Alison uses the phrase \\"Just do it already\\" to encourage Ben to put the condom on, but he misinterprets this to mean to dispense without using one. The following morning, they quickly learn over breakfast that they have little in common and go their separate ways, which leaves Ben visibly upset. Eight weeks later, Alison experiences morning sickness during an interview with James Franco and realizes she could be pregnant. She contacts Ben for the first time since their one-night stand to tell him. Although insensitive at first, Ben says he will be there to support Alison. While he is still unsure about being a parent, his father is excited. Alison's mother tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give the relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday. Alison thinks it's too early to think about marriage, because she is more concerned with hiding the pregnancy from her bosses, believing that they will fire her if they ever found out. After a somewhat promising beginning, tensions surface in the relationship. Alison is increasingly worried about Ben's lack of responsibility and commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship. These thoughts are due to her sister's unhappy marriage. Debbie's husband, Pete, works as a talent scout for rock bands, but he leaves at odd hours in the night, which makes her suspect he is having an affair. Upon investigating, she learns that he is actually part of a fantasy baseball draft, and that he has been doing other activities such as going to the movies on his own, which he explains he participates in to be free from Debbie's controlling manner. This results in their separation, and when Ben expresses amusement at Pete's deception, it leads to a heated argument with Alison as they drive to her doctor. Angered, she ejects him from her car and abandons him in the middle of a busy street. He tracks her down to her appointment and they both start another argument, leading to their own breakup. Ben and Pete decide to go on a road trip to Las Vegas. Under the heavy influence of psychedelic mushrooms, they realize their loss and decide to take responsibility for their relationships. Simultaneously, Debbie drags a timid Alison out partying with her, but they are refused admission to a nightclub by its apologetic bouncer on account of Debbie's age and Alison's pregnancy, leading to Debbie's tearful laments about her life and her desire to have Pete back. They reconcile at their daughter's birthday party, but when Ben tries to work things out with Alison, she doesn't want to get back together. Alison's boss finds out about her pregnancy, and sees an opportunity to boost ratings with female viewers by having Alison interview pregnant celebrities. After a talk with his father, Ben decides to take responsibility and goes to great effort to change his ways, including moving out of his friends' house, getting an office job as a web designer, and creating a baby's room in his new apartment. He also starts reading the pregnancy books that he had purchased early on. When Alison goes into labor and is unable to contact her doctor, she calls Ben, as Debbie and Pete are at Legoland. Ben discovers that the gynecologist they had been seeing is out of town, at a Bar Mitzvah, despite having assured them that he never took vacations. Ben calls him and leaves a furious voicemail, threatening murder. During labor, Alison apologizes for doubting Ben's commitment and admits that she never thought the man who got her pregnant would be the right one for her. When Debbie and Pete arrive at the hospital, Ben adamantly refuses to allow her to be at Alison's side, insisting that it's his place. Debbie is both furious and impressed that Ben took charge of the situation and begins to change her formerly negative opinion about him. The couple welcomes a baby girl (a boy in the alternate ending) and settle down happily together in a new apartment in Los Angeles.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90%, based on 252 reviews, with an average rating of 7.69/10.

Rogen pointed to Heigl's work in the film The Ugly Truth to illustrate his point. Rogen said: \\"I hear there's a scene where she's wearing underwear with a vibrator in it, so I'd have to see if that is uplifting for women.\\" Apatow remarked on Heigl's criticisms, stating that he had expected an apology from Heigl. \\"You would think at some point I'd get a call saying she was sorry, that she was tired, and then the call never comes.\\" In August 2016, Rogen again spoke to Howard Stern about how he had felt hurt and somewhat betrayed back then by Heigl's comments. He went on to talk about what a great rapport they'd had on set while working together, and that at the time he had even envisioned making many more movies with her. Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still really liked her, and that he never would have wanted the incident to hurt her career. Heigl responded by saying that Rogen had \\"handled that so beautifully,\\" and that she felt nothing but \\"love and respect\\" for him. \\"It was so long ago at this point, I just wish him so much goodness, and I felt that from him, too,\\" she said. =Top ten lists= The film made the top-ten list of the jury for the 2007 AFI Awards as well as the top-ten lists of several well-known critics, with the AFI jury calling it the \\"funniest, freshest comedy of this generation\\" and a film that \\"stretches the boundaries of romantic comedies.\\" John Newman, respected film critic for the Boston Bubble, called the film \\"a better, raunchy, modern version of Some Like it Hot.\\"AFI AWARDS 2007 , from the American Film Institute website Early on the film was deemed the best reviewed wide release of 2007 by the Rotten Tomatoes' website.

July 16, 1962) and Steve McDonagh (b. June 14, 1964). Smith and McDonagh launched the show after winning the network's reality contest, The Next Food Network Star, which granted them a six-show Food Network series. The original series was entitled Party Line with Dan and Steve, but eventually the hosts were allowed to change the title in order to reflect and give credit to their independent Chicago catering business, The Hearty Boys, Co. Overview Party Line deconstructs food that is fit for entertaining, yet retains a simple and comforting heartiness. With recipes such as three-cheese spaghetti pie and truffle brownies, the focus is largely on attractive and flavorful dishes that require a minimum of fuss and are appropriate for mid- to large-sized gatherings. Like many of Food Network's cooking shows, Party Line with the Hearty Boys was taped on the Food Network sets without a studio audience. Also, again following in the footsteps of their fellow Food Network stars, Smith and McDonagh have authored a cookbook titled Talk With Your Mouth Full, The Hearty Boys Cookbook (Stewart, Tabori and Chang), which was slated for release in September 2007. Dan and Steve both got their start as New York actors and can both sing and dance. Steve was known professionally as Steve Dunne and continued his career in the Chicago area. In July 2005, they adopted a son through The Cradle in Evanston. He was seen in the 2006 Thanksgiving episode. The series was not renewed by Food Network in 2006.

The 12-mile Belfast-Bangor railway line had a well used passenger service and, being devoid of goods traffic, was chosen as the testing ground for the diesel railcar era. Before deciding to build its own railcars the UTA conducted an experiment by borrowing from the GNR(I). This was considered such a success that the UTA constructed its own experimental three-coach diesel railcar set at its Duncrue Street works, this being outshopped in late Spring 1951, ready for testing and driver training. History The prototype train was converted from conventional locomotive-hauled stock and consisted of two power cars with an intermediate, but non-powered trailer car. Each of the power cars was fitted with two under-floor AEC engines, and all the vehicles were substantially internally rebuilt, and fitted with power-operated sliding doors. The prototype Multi-engined Diesel (MED) trains went into revenue-earning service in March 1952. To continue its plans for dieselisation the UTA, over the following two years, built another 14 three-car trains in three batches, and by the following Spring (1954) it was able to operate all its Bangor line services with railcars. One of the changes made from the prototype was in the power unit; the new batch, instead of A.E.C., were fitted with Leyland-Walker under-floor engines of 125 h.p. Passenger numbers increased and by 1956 with capacity found wanting, an additional trailer car was included in each set, the engine capacity being uprated to 165 h.p. to cope. The UTA numbering sequence continued from earlier building, the powered cars being numbered from 8 to 35 inclusive (28 units). They were withdrawn from service between 1973 and 1978 The initial batch of trailers was 201 to 214 renumbered to 501 to 514 in 1958. The additional 1956 trailers initially retained their steam stock numbers before becoming 516 to 527 in 1958 515 was originally 215 built in 1953 for Ganz railcar 5. It became 515 in 1958 and was converted to MED operation in 1963 In a works visit in mid-1962, intermediate cars 526 and 527 were fitted so that they could run with either Multi-engined (MED) or Multi- purpose (MPD) railcar trains and were not just restricted to their own type. After withdrawal they were sent to Mageramorne to be scrapped but as the scrapping commenced it was discovered that they contained blue asbestos so they were sent to Antrim and Ballymena till 1980 from 1980 onward they were dumped in Crosshill Quarry crumlin along with dozens of other railcars. Livery Under the UTA, from 1951, a Brunswick Green livery was applied to passenger carrying stock and the MED's were outshopped as new in this colour, which lasted until the early 1960s. This was followed by a \\"regionalised colour scheme\\" for the system, the livery reflecting the operating area of the MED's. Trains operating on the Bangor line were painted in an \\"Olive Green\\" colour, considerably lighter that used for the steam locomotives of the former BCDR; those on the former NCC lines had lower panels in \\"LMS red\\", with the upper panels officially described as white, but in fact a very pale shade of grey. The trains operating on the former GNR section were painted with blue lower panels, somewhat lighter than that used by the GNR, and cream; with silver-grey roofs.

It can be combined with a folding table. Uses Folding chairs are generally used for seating in areas where permanent seating is not possible or practical. This includes outdoor and indoor events such as funerals, college graduations, religious services, and sporting events and competitions. Folding chairs are also used in the home for any situation requiring extra seating. This includes parties, card games, and temporary seating at the dinner table. Some folding chairs are rocking chairs as well. History Frame of the folding chair of Guldh√∏j, Denmark (Nordic Bronze Age, 2nd half of 14th century B.C.)A folding chair from the Bronze Age National Museum of Denmark Japanese traditional folding chair Folding chairs or stools were used as seating in the Mediterranean area in the 15th-13th century BC. The chairs were also used as grave goods in the richest graves. A folding chair of ebony and ivory with gold fittings was found in Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt. Folding chairs were already used in the Nordic Bronze Age, Ancient Egypt, Minoan Greece and Ancient Rome. The frame was mostly made of wood, and seldom made of metal. The wood was inlaid with artistic carvings, gilded, and decorated with ivory. In Northern Europe, the remains of more than 18 folding chairs are known dating back to the Nordic Bronze Age such as the Daensen folding chair and the Guldh√∏j chair, found near Vamdrup, Denmark. The folding chair became especially widespread during the Middle Ages. It was treasured as a liturgical furniture piece. Since the 15th and 16th centuries the folding chair has mostly had arm and head rests. Of course, newer chairs which are often found at functions and events are also called folding chairs. They are portable and easy to use. In the United States, an early patent for a folding chair was by John Cram in 1855.Patent 13479, Folding Chair In 1947, Fredric Arnold created the first aluminum folding chair with fabric strapping for the seat and back. By 1957, the Fredric Arnold Company of Brooklyn, New York, was manufacturing more than 14,000 chairs per day. Today, the folding chair is mostly made of hard plastic or metal or wood. Folding chairs can be divided into different categories. Beginning in the mid-1980s, folding chairs were used in professional wrestling as weapons, mainly by the promotion now known as WWE. It should be well noted that only chairs that are specifically modified to be lighter and easier to handle are used and special permission must be granted beforehand for their use. The investigation into Chris Benoit's death cited chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is often caused by chair shots to the head and other related concussions as a leading cause of his symptoms. Chair shots to the head are now banned in the WWE, and the use of chairs was toned down to prevent related injuries. Design Folding chairs typically weigh from and are produced in a variety of styles, folding mechanisms, and materials. =Leg pivoting= Folding chair legs can pivot to fold either under the seat, or at the seat. Most folding chairs pivot at the seat level. The seat aligns between the back supports. The back support and the front legs are the same part. There are, however, several designs that fold under the seat. Side-X stools consist of two X-shaped pieces with a sheet of cloth between them that becomes the seat. Front-X chairs are similar to side-X stools, but have the addition of a backrest. Side-X chairs are unique because the support for the backrest and front foot is the same part. The seat is collapsed to align between the sidebars, either down between the front legs, or up to align between back-sidebars. Mechanisms vary, but the supports for the back and the front feet are invariably the same part. Pricing Folding chairs of the side-X variety set up for an outdoor eventPrices and quality can be roughly divided into four categories, and are largely the same as for stacking chairs: =Low range = This light and inexpensive furniture is usually made from steel tubing, with a plastic seat and backrest. This style is very common in homes, churches, schools, and community events. = Mid-range = These are sturdy and a greater variety in styles and materials. They are typically not upholstered. They cost from approximately $25 apiece (2008). Their primary use is seating for large arenas, outdoor or places of worship, but also cafes and brasseries. = Upper range = These folding chairs are often multiple reinforced, and come with padded seats and backrest. These are mainly sold for sporting events. The seat is sometimes made to fall backward so that it stands upright, making rainwater run off the upholstered seat. = High end = Folding chairs in this category are rare and sold in a very small volume. They cost from $150 to $300 apiece. They may be upholstered, and are often priced higher because they are associated with a renowned manufacturer.

On 30 October 1753 he married Dorothy Willing, the daughter of Charles Willing, a Philadelphia merchant. According to family stories, he persuaded the family of Horatio Nelson to let Horatio join the navy, and he lost the opportunity to be appointed Governor of Halifax as he was visiting his wife in Scotland when the offer came in. In 1780 he was captain of the Gibraltar, and was present when Admiral George Rodney captured the island of Sint Eustatius from the Dutch during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Selected to take home dispatches, he was knighted on arrival. In 1783 he appointed Commander-in- Chief, The Nore. When King George III inspected Stirling's ships, he was so impressed that he offered to make Stirling a baronet. Stirling declined, but his eldest son, also named Walter, later claimed the title, becoming Sir Walter Stirling, 1st Baronet of Faskine. He died in London in November 1786. His second surviving son, Charles, also became an admiral. A grandson by his daughter Anne was James Stirling, first Governor of Western Australia, and himself an admiral in later life.

In some cases it can be the actual antigen- binding site, and in some cases it may comprise variable region sequences outside of the antigen-binding site on the antibody itself. Thus each antibody would have multiple idiotopes; and the set of these individual idiotopes is termed the idiotype of the antibody. Idiotopes contrast with allotopes, which are non-varying structures on the Fc receptor. If a separate antibody is produced that has specific binding capabilities to an idiotope of the previously described antibody, it is said to be an \\"anti-idiotypic antibody\\". If such is the case, the anti-idiotypic antibodies will be able to bind to the B lymphocyte receptor for the original antigen and inhibit the immune response to that antigen. This type of regulation was proposed by Niels Jerne in 1974. He termed it the \\"Network Hypothesis\\". This type of B lymphocyte regulation may be partially responsible for preventing an immune response from getting out of control, which would elicit damage to host tissue or even cause an autoimmune diseased state. Because of the resemblance of anti-idiotypic antibodies to the original antigen, vaccine studies have been performed. These types of vaccines are called \\"idiotypic vaccines\\". An anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (desginated K2-3f) was generated to possess an \\"internal image of cocaine\\". The anti-idiotypic antibody bound to the human dopamine transporter with mimicry of the cocaine molecule and completely inhibited cocaine binding. None are produced commercially to date.

While they are both called stylesheet languages, they have very different purposes and ways of going about their tasks.  Cascading Style Sheets  CSS is designed around styling a document, structured in a markup language, HTML and XML (including XHTML and SVG) documents. It was created for that purpose. The code CSS is non-XML syntax to define the style information for the various elements of the document that it styles. The language to structure a document (markup language) is a prelimit to CSS. A markup language, like HTML and less XUL, may define some primitive elements to style a document, for example to bold. CSS post styles a document to \\"screen media\\" or \\"paged media\\". Screen media, displayed as a single page (possibly with hyperlinks), that has a fixed horizontal width but a virtually unlimited vertical height. Scrolling is often the method of choice for viewing parts of screen media. This is in contrast to \\"paged media\\", which has multiple pages, each with specific fixed horizontal and vertical dimensions. To style paged media involves a variety of complexities that screen media does not. Since CSS was designed originally for screen media, its paged facilities lacked. CSS version 3.0 provides new features that allow CSS to more adequately style documents for paged display.  Extensible Stylesheet Language  XSL has evolved drastically from its initial design into something very different from its original purpose. The original idea for XSL was to create an XML-based styling language directed toward paged display media. The mechanism they used to accomplish this task was to divide the process into two distinct steps. First, the XML document would be transformed into an intermediate form. The process for performing this transformation would be governed by the XSL stylesheet, as defined by the XSL specification. The result of this transformation would be an XML document in an intermediate language, known as XSL-FO (also defined by the XSL specification). However, in the process of designing the transformation step, it was realized that a generic XML transformation language would be useful for more than merely creating a presentation of an XML document. As such, a new working group was split off from the XSL working group, and the XSL Transformations (XSLT) language became something that was considered separate from the styling information of the XSL-FO document. Even that split was expanded when XPath became its own separate specification, though still strongly tied to XSLT. The combination of XSLT and XSL-FO creates a powerful styling language, though much more complex than CSS. XSLT is a Turing complete language, while CSS is not; this demonstrates a degree of power and flexibility not found in CSS. Additionally, XSLT is capable of creating content, such as automatically creating a table of contents just from chapters in a book, or removing/selecting content, such as only generating a glossary from a book. XSLT version 1.0 with the EXSLT extensions, or XSLT version 2.0 is capable of generating multiple documents as well, such as dividing the chapters in a book into their own individual pages. By contrast, a CSS can only selectively remove content by not displaying it. XSL-FO is unlike CSS in that the XSL-FO document stands alone. CSS modifies a document that is attached to it, while the XSL-FO document (usually the result of the transformation by XSLT of the original document) contains all of the content to be presented in a purely presentational format. It has a wide range of specification options with regard to paged formatting and higher-quality typesetting. But it does not specify the pages themselves. The XSL-FO document must be passed through an XSL-FO processor utility that generates the final paged media, much like HTML+CSS must pass through a web browser to be displayed in its formatted state. The complexity of XSL-FO is a problem, largely because implementing an FO processor is very difficult. CSS implementations in web browsers are still not entirely compatible with one another, and it is much simpler to write a CSS processor than an FO processor. However, for richly specified paged media, such complexity is ultimately required in order to be able to solve various typesetting problems.

Dover Museum is a museum in Dover, Kent, in south-east England. History Founded in February 1836 by the town's mayor Edward Pett Thompson, it was initially housed in the old Guildhall and run by the Dover Philosophical Institute. The Town Council (predecessor of Dover District Council) formally took it over 12 years later, constructing a new building to house it and the town's market, in Market Square.Press Releases Shelled from France in 1942 during the Second World War, the Museum lost much of its collections, including nearly all of its natural history collections. Much of the surviving material was left neglected in caves and other stores until 1946, and it is estimated only 30% of the pre-war collection survived to that date. In 1948 a 'temporary' museum was opened in the Town Hall's undercroft, but this in fact lasted until 1991, when a new museum building on three stories (behind the Museum's original Victorian facade) was opened in Market Square. On 20 July 1999 the Queen opened a new gallery on the Museum's second floor centred on the Dover Bronze Age Boat.Press Releases In December 2000, this gallery was awarded the British Archaeological Awards ICI Award 2000, for its contribution to archaeological knowledge. Collections Its collections, displayed on three floors include: * Ground floor ‚Äî Archaeology gallery ‚Äî Dover and the Dover District Council area (including Deal and Walmer, which do not yet have their own town museum, only the Deal Maritime Museum) from prehistoric times to 1066, including Roman and Saxon Dover (including the Saxon cemetery from Buckland). It reuses a diorama of Claudius's arrival on elephant at Richborough in 43 AD and full size reconstructed figures of a Celt and a Roman, all three of which are from the now defunct White Cliffs Experience next door. * First floor ‚Äì Temporary exhibition gallery. * Second floor: ** History of Dover town, Cinque Ports and Dover Castle from 1066 to the modern era. This includes the Victoriana Museum collection, bequeathed in 1990 by William Williamson of Deal and including works by artists such as Dame Laura Knight, Lady Alma Tadema, Fantin Latour, J.F. Herring, Henry Bernard Chalon, David Cox, E.W. Cooke and Benjamin Robert Haydon. ** The 2003 Dover Bronze Age Boat gallery, where the Langdon Bay hoard is also displayed. White Cliffs Experience The White Cliffs Experience was a visitor attraction in Dover, attached to Dover Museum. It opened in 1991 and, though it underwent a refit halfway through its life, it still did not prove a success and closed in 1999.Dover Discovery Centre It included a Blitz Experience (an audio-visual street scene of World War II). Only a small portion of the actual archaeology was on display, the attraction instead being reliant on dioramas and audio-visual displays. Even after one redesign, it did not prove a success and has now been closed and its building converted into the Dover Library and Discovery Centre. That portion of the archaeology can still be viewed, but only by request from the library staff. Many of the dioramas and reconstruction figures have been reused in Dover Museum. The White Cliffs Experience was closed in 1999 for a combination of reasons; the Labour opposition group on Dover District Council had always been against the WCE, labelling it 'The White Elephant' and opposing the amount of money it took to run as well as complaining that it fell short of achieving the predicted 300,000 visitors a year. When they came to power in 1997, the new Labour council's policies for regenerating Dover relied on attracting industry and acting as an 'enabler' rather than a provider of heritage and tourism facilities. They withdrew much of the money previously paid to tourism initiatives. At the same time, the technology used to run the animatronics and shows (laser discs, carousel slide projectors and 35mm film projectors, etc.) had quickly dated and become obsolete and by 1998 needed replacing. Various quotes were received to update the WCE but were beyond what the Council were prepared to pay so they decided to cut their losses and close the Experience.

Without being registered to the camp system, most were killed in gas chambers hours after arriving. Carpathian Ruthenia was a region in the easternmost part of Czechoslovakia (Subcarpathian Ruthenia, or Transcarpathia) that became autonomous within that country in September 1938, declared its independence as the \\"Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine‚Äù in March 1939, was immediately occupied and annexed by Hungary, invaded by the Soviet Red Army in 1944 and incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1946. In total between 1939 and 1944 80,000 Carpathian Ukrainians perished.  Independence and annexation by Hungary In November 1938, under the First Vienna Award which resulted from the Munich Agreement, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy prevailed on the Second Czechoslovak Republic to cede the southern third of Slovakia and southern Carpathian Ruthenia to the Kingdom of Hungary. Between 14 March and 15 March 1939, the Slovak Republic declared its independence and Nazi Germany occupied Bohemia and Moravia creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. On 15 March, Carpatho-Ukraine declared its independence as the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine, with the Reverend Avhustyn Voloshyn as head of state. Hungary immediately occupied and annexed the new republic. The remnants of the Czechoslovak Army abandoned the newly formed republic and Carpatho-Ukraine tried to defend itself by local self- defense groups organized by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists as Carpathian Sich. On 18 March, resistance to the invasion ended. On 23 March Hungary annexed further parts of eastern Slovakia west of Carpatho-Rus. The Hungarian invasion was followed by a few weeks of terror in which more than 27,000 people were shot dead without trial and investigation. Over 75,000 Ukrainians decided to seek asylum in the USSR; of those almost 60,000 of them died in Gulag prison-camps. Today is the 80th anniversary of the proclamation of the Carpathian Ukraine, Ukrinform (15 March 2019) The territory covered by the Governorate of Subcarpathia was divided into three, the administrative branch offices of Ung (), Bereg () and M√°ramaros (), having Hungarian and the Rusyn language as official languages. Beginning in 1939, the Jewish laws passed in Hungary were extended to the newly annexed territories, including the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia. Then in the summer of 1941, Hungarian authorities deported about 18,000 Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia to the Galician area of the occupied Ukraine. This was done under the guise of expelling alien refugees, but in practice most of those expelled were from families that had lived in the region for the previous 50‚Äì100 years, but their legal identification was problematic due to the numerous change of status quo and the contemporary laws and regulations also did not support them to confirm their former Hungarian citizenship. Later, most of the deportees were handed over to Nazi German Einsatzgruppen units at Kaminets Podolsk and machine- gunned over a three-day period in August 1941.In Defense of Christian Hungary: Religion, Nationalism, and Antisemitism 1890-1944, Cornell University Press, Paul A. Hanebrink, pages 192-3 Hungarian authorities conscripted Jewish men of working age into slave labor gangs in which a high proportion perished.Historical Dictionary of the Holocaust, Scarecrow Press, Jack R. Fischel, page 119 In the March 1944 Operation Margarethe, German forces overthrew the Hungarian government and installed D√∂me Szt√≥jay as Prime minister. In April 1944, 17 main ghettos were set up in cities in Ruthenia. 144,000 Jews were rounded up and held there. Starting on May 15, 1944 Jews were taken out of these sites to Auschwitz every day until the last deportation on June 7, 1944. By June 1944, nearly all the Jews from ghettos of Carpathian Ruthenia had been exterminated, together with other Hungarian Jews.The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary, Wayne State University Press, Randolph L. Braham pages, 117-120, 137 Of more than 100,000 Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia, around 90,000 were murdered. Soviet occupation In October 1944, Carpathian Ruthenia was taken by the Soviets. A Czechoslovak delegation under Franti≈°ek Nƒõmec was dispatched to the area. The delegation was to mobilize the liberated local population to form a Czechoslovak army and to prepare for elections in cooperation with recently established national committees. Loyalty to a Czechoslovak state was tenuous in Carpathian Ruthenia. The Czechoslovak government-in-exile led by President Edvard Bene≈° issued a proclamation in April 1944 excluding from political participation former collaborationist Hungarians, Germans, and the Russophile Ruthenian followers of Andrej Brody and the Fencik Party (who had collaborated with the Hungarians). This amounted to approximately one-third of the population. Another one-third was communist, leaving one-third of the population presumably sympathetic to the Czechoslovak Republic. Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Upon arrival in the territory, the Czechoslovak delegation set up headquarters in Khust and on 30 October issued a mobilization proclamation. Soviet military forces prevented both the printing and the posting of the Czechoslovak proclamation and proceeded instead to organize the local population. Protests from Bene≈°'s government-in-exile went unheeded. Soviet activities led much of the local population to believe that Soviet annexation was imminent. The Czechoslovak delegation was also prevented from establishing a cooperative relationship with the local national committees promoted by the Soviets. On 19 November, the communists, meeting in Mukachevo, issued a resolution requesting separation of the territory and the incorporation into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. On November 26, the Congress of National Committees unanimously accepted the resolution of the communists. The Congress elected the National Council and instructed that a delegation be sent to Moscow to discuss union. The Czechoslovak delegation was asked to leave the area. Negotiations between the Czechoslovak government and Moscow ensued. Both Czech and Slovak communists encouraged Bene≈° to resign on the territory. The Soviet Union agreed to postpone annexation until the postwar period to avoid compromising Bene≈°'s policy based on the pre-Munich frontiers. After World War II, in June 1945, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union signed a treaty ceding Carpathian-Ruthenia to the Soviets. The inhabitants - Czechs, Slovaks and Rusyns - were given the choice of Czechoslovak or Soviet citizenship. In 1946 the area became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, as the Zakarpattia Oblast ('Transcarpathian Oblast'). Impact on Hungarian population The end of the war was a cataclysm for the ethnic Hungarian population of the area: 10,000 fled before the arrival of Soviet forces. Many of the remaining adult men (25,000) were deported to the Soviet Union; about 30% of them died in Soviet gulags. As a result of war losses, emigration and extermination of Hungarian Jews, the Hungarian-speaking population of Carpathian Ruthenia decreased from 161,000 in 1941 (Hungarian census) to 66,000 in 1947 (Soviet census); the low 1947 number is doubtless in part a result of Hungarians' fear to declare their true nationality.

According to Feynman: Overview The idea is based on the world lines traced out across spacetime by every electron. Rather than have myriad such lines, Wheeler suggested that they could all be parts of one single line like a huge tangled knot, traced out by the one electron. Any given moment in time is represented by a slice across spacetime, and would meet the knotted line a great many times. Each such meeting point represents a real electron at that moment. At those points, half the lines will be directed forward in time and half will have looped round and be directed backwards. Wheeler suggested that these backwards sections appeared as the antiparticle to the electron, the positron. Many more electrons have been observed than positrons, and electrons are thought to comfortably outnumber them. According to Feynman he raised this issue with Wheeler, who speculated that the missing positrons might be hidden within protons. Feynman was struck by Wheeler's insight that antiparticles could be represented by reversed world lines, and credits this to Wheeler, saying in his Nobel speech: Feynman later proposed this interpretation of the positron as an electron moving backward in time in his 1949 paper \\"The Theory of Positrons\\". Yoichiro Nambu later applied it to all production and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that \\"the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past.\\"  See also  * Identical particles * Eddington number * T-symmetry References External links * Concepts in physics Quantum mechanics Quantum field theory Quantum electrodynamics 1940 in science Physical cosmology Conceptual models Richard Feynman ","title":"One-electron universe"},{"id":"4295489","text":"Ben Jones (born 14 March 1972) is a British actor and presenter.

The Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 is a statutory instrument of the United Kingdom government, defining the boundaries of internal waters, territorial sea, and British Fishing Limits adjacent to Scotland. It was introduced in accordance with the Scotland Act 1998, which established the devolved Scottish Parliament. Defining jurisdictions The territorial waters defined come under the jurisdiction of Scots law, and are also used for defining the area of operation of the Scottish Government (including Marine Scotland), SEPA, and other Scottish Government agencies and public bodies. The territorial waters defined as not being Scottish waters come under the jurisdiction of either English law or Northern Ireland law. Because the order defines the territorial limits of the three separate jurisdictions, it comprises a piece of constitutional law in the constitution of the United Kingdom. Scottish waters Scottish waters is a colloquial term which can refer to different sea areas, including: * Internal waters and territorial sea adjacent to Scotland. (\\"Scotland\\" as defined in the Scotland Act 1998) * British Fishing Limits adjacent to Scotland. (\\"The Scottish Zone\\" as defined in the Scotland Act 1998) * The UK continental shelf limits adjacent to Scotland. (Part of the \\"Scottish offshore marine region\\" as defined in the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009) Differences with existing boundaries The maritime boundary adopted by the order is an equidistant boundary. This differed from the boundary established by the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Act 1987 which defined a straight line border between Scotland and England in the North Sea along the latitude of 55¬∞ 50' 00\\"N. As a result, some oil fields previously subject to Scots civil law were transferred to English jurisdiction. Professor Alex Kemp of the University of Aberdeen argued that the movement of the line did not make much difference from an economic perspective, \\"because [these] are just a handful of fields, and [no longer] very important ones\\". Potential implications for Scottish independence The European Journal of International Law published a detailed article in 2001http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/12/1/505.pdf entitled \\"Prospective Anglo-Scottish maritime boundary revisited\\". This concludes that, in the event of Scottish independence, the maritime border between Scotland and England as set out in the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 would not comply with international law.

It was developed by the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) as a progression of the earlier Multi-engined Diesel (MED). The MED concept, while suitable for short commuter links, was not considered so for the Northern Counties Committee section, with its main line from Belfast to Derry where speeds of up to 110 km/h (70 mph) were required. A new railcar development was needed, and the MED was superseded by the MPD. History The new railcars were to operate on the former ‚Äòbroad gauge‚Äô lines of the NCC which not only covered suburban services in and around Belfast, but also the long main line from that city to Derry. The \\"new\\" trains, just as with the earlier MEDs, were converted from existing locomotive-hauled stock. These became known as Multi-purpose Diesel (MPD) railcars and were built between 1957 and 1962. The first 10 power cars being intended for the Derry line trains, with the others being for the Belfast local services. The power cars were originally fitted with a 275 h.p. Leyland engine, mounted beneath the chassis and driving both axles on the rear bogie through a torque converter. However problems were encountered with these engines and, in the mid-1960s, it was decided to re-engine 12 cars with 260 hp AEC engines and a further 17 with 275 hp engines from Rolls Royce. The Belfast - Derry express services, for which the first 10 MPDs were built, called for a high power / weight ratio and, on occasion, saw the five-coach train formation made up of four power cars with a restaurant car. On local services the power cars operated with trailers. The loss of one of the power cars came about when No. 58 suffered a collision with a motor vehicle on a level crossing in July 1958, the MPD was written off, after just six weeks in service. Numbering The numbering sequence followed on from the MEDs, the single-cab power cars being numbered from 36 to 62 inclusive (27 cars), those with a cab at both ends from 63 to 65 inclusive (3 cars). The power cars numbered 46 to 53 inclusive, were originally non-gangwayed but were rebuilt on their works visits between 1968 and 1970. The last of the single-cab power cars was withdrawn in 1981, the double-cab vehicles lasting a little longer. Nos. 63 and 65 withdrawn in 1981, No.64 in 1983. There were 18 trailer cars numbered between 529 and 550: *529-534, 540, 541, 542 gangwayed driving trailers with cab at one end. *535-539 and 543 non gangwayed driving trailers with cab at one end rebuilt as gangwayed non driving trailers 1968-1970 *548 549 550 buffet cars *548 could also work with 70 class sets *550 was converted to a 70 class car in 1966 Preservation Car number 728 at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway station in October 2015 Buffet Car 550 entered preservation in 1978 with the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland, whereupon it regained its original UTA number, 87, and was painted in LMS NCC livery.

It is related to the capital or profit share, the part of income going to capital, which is also known as the K‚ÄìY ratio. The labor share is a key indicator for the distribution of income. The wage share is countercyclical; that is, it tends to fall when output increases and rise when output decreases. Despite fluctuating over the business cycle, the wage share was once thought to be stable, which Keynes described as \\"one of the most surprising, yet best- established facts in the whole range of economic statistics.\\" However, the wage share has declined in most developed countries since the 1980s. Definition The wage share can be defined in various ways, but empirically it is usually defined as total labor compensation or labor costs over nominal GDP or gross value added. Often the capital share and labor share are assumed to sum to 100%, so that each can be deduced from the other. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines the labor share in a given sector (LS) as the ratio of labor compensation paid in that sector (C) to current dollar output (CU), ie. LS = C / CU. The non-labor or capital share (NLS) is defined as 1 ‚àí LS. In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Piketty described the accounting identity Œ± = r √ó Œ≤ as the 'first fundamental law of capitalism', where Œ± represents the capital share, r is the rate of return on capital, and Œ≤ is the capital to income ratio. Piketty defined the wage share as 1 ‚àí Œ±. Because the self-employed perform labor which is not rewarded with wages, the labor share may be underestimated in sectors with a high rate of self- employment. One approach is to assume the labor share of proprietors' income to be fixed. The OECD and the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjust labor compensation by assuming that the self-employed have the same average wage as employees in the same sector. History The importance of the distribution of income between the factors of production ‚Äì capital, land and labor ‚Äì has long been recognized. Ricardo (1817) said that to determine the laws which regulate this distribution is the \\"principal problem in political economy\\". Cobb and Douglas's Theory of Production (1928) introduced empirically- determined constants Œ± and Œ≤ which corresponded to the capital and labor share respectively. Cobb and Douglas found that the wage share was about 75%. For most of the 20th century, constant labor share was a stylized fact known as Bowley's law. Historical measurements of the wage share can be charted using the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's FRED tool, which includes time series published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis. Labor share in the United States from 1948‚Äì2016, comparing time series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis.

It sits above mean sea level, at a distance of from Salta City and from Buenos Aires. It has about 12,000 inhabitants (). The town is an important tourist centre for exploring the Calchaqu√≠es valleys, and because of the quality and originality of the wines produced in the area. The largest golf course in South America, at , is currently being developed just outside the city center at La Estancia de Cafayate.La Estancia de Cafayate The town was founded in 1840 by Manuel Fernando de Aramburu, at the site of a mission. In 1863 the Cafayate Department was created, of which Cafayate is the capital. Etymology The Cafayates were a tribe of the Diaguita-Calchaqu√≠ group, which, together with the related Tolomb√≥n, inhabited the Valles Calchaqu√≠es prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadores. Their language was known as Cac√°n. Like other Diaguita tribes, they had recently fallen under the influence of the Incas, after a prolonged resistance. They later mounted a fierce resistance to the Spaniards. Even though most agree that the root of Cafayate is Quechua, the meaning of the term is disputed. Some claim it to mean \\"Box of Water\\", others to be a deformation of Capac-Yac (\\"Great Lake\\") or Capac-Yaco (\\"Great Chief\\" or \\"Wealthy People\\"). Another Cac√°n version understands it as \\"Grave of Sorrows\\". Wines The wine production is most important in the Valles Calchaqu√≠es. The wines produced in the region benefit from the low-humidity mild weather of the valleys that receive an average of less than 250 mm of precipitation per year. The most characteristic type of wine cultivated in the area is torront√©s. Most wine-cellars around the town host free guided tours.

The topography of Cornwall is such that the route, which is generally east-west, cuts across numerous deep river valleys that generally run north-south. At the time of construction of the line, money was in short supply due to the collapse in confidence following the railway mania, and the company sought ways of reducing expenditure. On the advice of the Victorian railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, they constructed the river crossings in the form of wooden viaducts, 42 in total, consisting of timber deck spans supported by fans of timber bracing built on masonry piers. This unusual method of construction substantially reduced the first cost of construction compared to an all-masonry structure, but at the cost of more expensive maintenance. Replacement of the timber viaducts by all-masonry structures began in the 1870s but a few remained in service until the 1930s. History The Cornwall Railway linked Plymouth with Falmouth. The section from Plymouth to was opened on 4 May 1859, and the remainder to Falmouth on 24 August 1863. Although the line had been designed by Brunel, this was after his death and the construction under the supervision of R P Brereton. It was built as a single-track broad gauge line. The of railway crossed 45 rivers and deep valleys. Of these 43 were spanned by viaducts of various types built partly or entirely from timber. Workshops were established at where timber could arrive on barges to be preserved and cut to size. The offcuts from the timbers used for the viaducts and track were then used for the construction of the railway's buildings. The choice of timber was made to keep initial costs down, but Brunel had warned that this meant more expensive maintenance‚Äîrunning to ¬£10,000 annually. Replacement of the viaducts started in 1875 but led to a dispute in 1884 between the Cornwall Railway and the Great Western Railway which was leasing the line. The lease precluded the conversion of the line to standard gauge, and the Cornwall Railway refused to pay for the widening of the viaducts during rebuilding sufficient to accommodate a double line of standard gauge tracks. Following the amalgamation of the two companies on 1 July 1889 all the remaining viaducts on the main line to Truro were replaced. Most were either rebuilt in situ or by a replacement viaduct built immediately alongside, and in the latter case many of the original piers still remain today. Between Saltash and St Germans, a deviation line was built in 1908, eliminating the wooden viaducts on by-passed section of line. Those on the Falmouth branch were all replaced between 1923 and 1934. Constructional features The distinctive timber viaducts were constructed using yellow pine which was preserved by Kyanising (using chloride of mercury), or sometimes by Burnettising (using chloride of zinc) in the workshops at Lostwithiel. The various timbers were seated in cast iron chairs, and wrought iron was used for parts of the bridge which would be in tension, such as tie rods between spans. Five distinct types of viaduct were built to suit local conditions at each site. Peter John Margary, the Cornwall Railway engineer from 1868 to 1891, classified them as classes A to E. * Class A: The majority of viaducts were constructed on stone piers that rose to about below track level. From the tops of these radiated three fans of timber struts to support the beams beneath the track; one fan on each side and the third beneath the centre of the track. The struts radiated at around 55, 75, 105 and 125 degrees from horizontal (resulting in a // form), although there were some slight variations. This gave piers spaced at about centres. * Class B: A stronger support was given to St Pinnock, Largin, and Ponsanooth viaducts by replacing the central set of fan struts with a pair. These joined the outer fans at the top of the pier and met each other at the top, giving a W form when viewed across the width of the piers. * Class C: The soft ground of the tidal valleys at Weston Mill, Forder, Wivelscombe, and Nottar required a lighter structure. This was achieved by dispensing with the stone piers and replacing them with vertical timber trestles built on top of timber piles driven into the mud. There were no fans supporting the track, instead timber trusses were built directly on top of the timber trestles. * Class D: Coombe (by Saltash) and Moorswater viaducts had only two fans on each pier - one on each side - but the bottoms of these were joined by laminated timber beams between each set of fans, which created a continuous beam along the length of the viaduct above the top of the masonry piers. * Class E: The shallowest valleys at Grove, Draw Wood, and Probus were crossed by simple trestles of three parallel fans with two struts each in a V shape. Brunel's designs allowed any defective timber to be withdrawn and replaced. The first decay usually occurred at the bottom of legs where they were seated in the cast iron chairs, and around bolt holes. The other area with significant decay was generally underneath the decking that carried the track and ballast. After World War I it became difficult to obtain the preferred yellow pine and other timber with shorter life was used instead, although by this time only the viaducts on the Falmouth branch remained in use. Special gangs of men worked together on the viaduct maintenance. To reach timbers below the deck they worked from manila ropes. It was possible to work on the viaduct without closing the viaduct to trains, but a temporary speed restriction was enforced until the replacement was properly in place. The actual movement of the larger timbers was carried out on a Sunday when there were few trains operating.

() The only double track viaduct on the line, it was a Class A viaduct but with five fans of struts on each of the dwarf piers. It was high and long on 5 dwarf piers. Rebuilt with iron girders on brick piers in 1908. The land below the viaduct was the head of a tidal creek but is now drained and forms a park. In 1876 a new Cornwall Loop between Plymouth North Road station and the Cornwall Railway was opened, built on a viaduct alongside the Stonehouse Pool Viaduct. Millbay station and its connecting lines (on which Stonehouse Pool Viaduct was located) were closed in 1964; the girders have since been removed and a steel work of art has been erected in its place. =Keyham= Milepost 248.75, north of Devonport.

It was replaced by a stone viaduct on 19 October 1894. Because it crossed a deep, muddy tidal inlet, Brunel constructed this viaduct on timber piles and used timber trestles instead of stone piers. These were made from four groups of four timber baulks, each group raking inwards towards the top of the trestle. =Forder= Milepost 252.25, west of Saltash. () A Class C viaduct high and long on 16 trestles. It was demolished after the line was diverted to a more inland alignment on 19 May 1908. =Wivelscombe= Milepost 253.5, west of Saltash.

The fans consisted of two raking struts on either side of the track, tied beneath the track by cross braces, and a central pair of struts which were joined at the top as an inverted V; from the side this gave a / fan. It was demolished after the line was diverted to a more inland alignment on 19 May 1908. A fatal accident occurred here just two days after the opening of the railway. On 6 May 1859 the engine of the 7.25 p.m. train from Plymouth was approaching St Germans when it left the rails, hit the parapet of the viaduct and fell into the mud below, landing upside down. Two of the coaches also ended up in the creek. The driver, fireman, and one guard were killed. A second guard, Richard Paddon, was given a reward of five pounds for his part in keeping the remainder of the train on the viaduct and helping to rescue the survivors. At the inquest held on 10 May 1859, the Permanent Way Inspector, the Traffic Superintendent, and Mr Brereton, Brunel's Chief Engineer, were all unable to account for the derailment, and the jury verdict was accidental death.The Times newspaper, London, 11 May 1859, The Cornwall Railway Accident =Nottar= Milepost 255.25, across the River Lynher east of .

() This timber viaduct was not included in Margary's classification system as it was not a fan viaduct. Instead it was a timber truss on 16 timber trestles, creating a viaduct high and long. Piles were driven into the mud and the trestles built on top from four groups of four timber baulks, each group raking inwards towards the top of the trestle. Where the piers were on the river bank the trestles rested on low masonry plinths. It was not possible to remove individual timbers from the trestles, unlike the fan viaducts which were designed with piecemeal maintenance in mind.

The piers were further strengthened in 1933 by encasing them in stone. The Times newspaper reported that it \\"is stated to be 134ft. high and is the highest of the whole series of bridges by which the [Cornwall] railway is carried\\".The Times Newspaper, London, 10 February 1897, Serious Viaduct Accident Note: the original typography is maintained in the above quotation and in the quotations below. An accident occurred on 9 February 1897 during the reconstruction while a gang of 17 workmen were working below the viaduct superstructure on a platform that collapsed, throwing 12 of the men to their deaths. They were working in the seventh span; cross-girders had been installed and they were positioning a longitudinal wrought iron rail-bearer, moving it by hand with one end supported on the viaduct pier. The rail-bearer was 20 feet long. The \\"platform\\" they were working on, spanning that gap, was supported by a second-hand timber beam formerly used as a main structural member in one of the other spans; it had several notches cut out (for its former use) and there was decay at the slenderest point. The supervising engineer said a chain should have been used to support the centre, to take part of the load of the men and the rail- bearer. The inquest statements throw an interesting light on the working methods of the day: > Samuel Stephens, railway labourer, Liskeard, said he had been employed on > Coldrenick-viaduct since the summer. The scaffolding which fell had been > erected some weeks. At the time of the accident there were 13 men actually > bearing on the platform which collapsed.

Viaducts from Liskeard to Bodmin Road =Moorswater= Moorswater Viaduct as built Milepost 265.5, west of Liskeard. () A Class D viaduct high and long on 14 buttressed piers. John Binding, in his study of Brunel's Cornish Viaducts, thought that Moorswater, by virtue of its size and location, was surely the most spectacular. In 1855 two of the piers then under construction collapsed. Brunel inspected them and rebuilt them the following year to his original design. In 1867 about of one pier was dismantled and rebuilt. Instead of the usual metal tie rods between the tops of the piers, this viaduct was fitted with timber ties; vertical timber baulks were fitted at the corners of some piers. Moorswater Viaduct after reconstruction It was replaced by a new eight-arch stone viaduct with cast iron parapets on 25 February 1881. During this work H.G. Cole, the resident engineer, was killed when a steam crane fell over. Six of the old piers still stand alongside the new viaduct, but the weakest piers were taken down before they collapsed. The new viaduct and the remaining piers of the original structure were listed Grade II* on 26 November 1985.

It is known locally as the 'Five Arches'. =St Austell= St Austell viaduct Milepost 286.75, across the Trenance valley west of . () A Class A viaduct high and long on 10 piers. It was built on a curve and crosses the road to Bodmin at an angle. The pier next to this road had to be built to an unusual triangular plan to fit this unusual configuration. The viaduct was replaced by a new stone viaduct in 1899. This sprung from the same point at the St Austell end before taking up an adjacent alignment. This meant that the northern half of the new viaduct was built first, the timber structure dismantled, and then the southern side completed.
