In 1873, William Hengerer was admitted as a partner and the company became known as Barnes, Bancroft & Co. Along with other department stores located in Buffalo including AM&A;'s, Flint and Kent, and the Sweeney Company, Hengerer was very successful in the 1880s and 1890s. The department stores offered cooking classes, beauty parlors, and restaurants and introduced washing and sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, and iceboxes to the public. In 1889, Hengerer's new department store was built at 268 Main Street and was designed by Cyrus K. Porter and built of brick with Medina sandstone trim. In 1903, a new store was constructed and by 1907, Hengerer's boasted of being the largest department store between New York City and Chicago.

Following the trail  = Upper section (interrupted)= The trail starts in Caroline Springs, on to Burnside continuing through to Albanvale and then Deer Park (approx 10 km). The trail starts as a concrete path in Caroline Springs, where Caroline Springs Boulevarde crosses the creek. Some 2 km later use the road section from Westwood Drive to Bilungah Place. This leads to a gravel section and a ford to access the east side of the creek. A 1 km concrete path leads to a small footbridge near the Deer Park Secondary College at Deer Park. If the ford is flooded, a nearby road route can be used to access this footbridge instead.

The one kilometre link from Grieve Parade to the Federation Trail is incomplete and is being delayed by the construction of the West Gate Tunnel. There is an existing rough track but is unsuitable for riders and becomes exceedingly muddy in winter. With relative easy, this track could be improved to at least make it passable, so that riders could use the trail, rather than waiting till the West Gate tunnel is completed in late 2023. = Lowest section = The Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail goes through Altona Coastal Park - site of the old Williamstown Racecourse. A lone palm stands guard over the remains of the old grandstand. North of the park, at the ford over Racecourse Road and also at the south end of the park, trails split off that lead to a single path, that heads westerly towards Millers Road. Nearby was the old Williamstown Racecourse railway station. At Millers Rd cross the road to the serenity of Cherry Lake. A 3.7 km path circumnavigates the lake. On the way bird life including pelicans can be seen. It makes for stark contrast in this heavily industrialised area.

It is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc but is located in a mountain range behind the main Cascade volcanic front. The best known members of this enigmatic arc are the massive shields of Newberry Volcano, about farther north in Oregon, and Medicine Lake Volcano, about south in Northern California. Yamsay is the highest volcano in the eastern arc, almost higher than Newberry and Medicine Lake. A central part of Klamath mythology, the mountain offers activities such as hiking and horseback riding. Historically, the area around it has been inhabited by Native American tribes and settlers. Until the 1970s, a fire lookout tower sat on the summit of the mountain, and its foundation remains to this day.  Geography and geology  Diagram; plate tectonics of the Cascade Range Like other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Yamsay was produced by subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate. Annual convergence between the two continues at a rate of per year. The Cascades make up the majority of the North American West Coast volcanoes; they have been volcanically active for about 36 million years. The rock making up the Cascades is slightly older, dated between 55 and 42 million years old. In an attempt to organize the volcanoes by age, scientists typically divide them into two provinces: the High Cascadesthe younger volcanoesand the Western Cascades, comprising the older volcanoes. Yamsay, along with the Simcoe volcanic complex, Medicine Lake Highlands, and Newberry Volcano, make up a wayward range of shield volcanoes between and east of the main Cascade Range. Volcanism at these centers is unlike other eruptions in the Cascades, and it does not stem from fissures as would Basin and Range volcanism. The volcanoes appear to be isolated from the major volcanic ranges in the Northwestern United States, although scientists group them as part of the Cascades. Recent volcanism in the Cascades, lasting from 7 to 2 mya, produced largely basaltic and basaltic andesite-based material (up to 50 percent). On the eastern side of the High Cascades, however, volcanoes erupted dacite, andesite, and rhyolite. These materials made up several types of eruptions: lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows. In the most recent volcanic activity, andesite, basalt, and rhyolite have been erupted from High Cascades volcanoes, particularly the Three Sisters, Broken Top, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and Crater Lake.  History  The name Yamsay is a corruption of the Klamath (a Native American tribe of Southern Oregon) name Yamsi, a form of Yamash, meaning \\"north wind.\\" This mountain was supposed to be the home of Kmukamtch, the supreme being of Klamath mythology. Historically, the area by the mountain was inhabited by Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin Bands, all of the Snake Paiute people. The Yahooskins lived east of Yamsay Mountain, near modern-day Lakeview. Their group inhabited of land in Oregon and California. Traders entered the area at some point between 1825 and 1827, where they worked as trappers for the Hudson's Bay Company. After routes opened up in 1846, Fort Klamath was built (in 1863).Zilverberg, p. 3. The city of Klamath Falls (southwest of Yamsay) sprang up in the 1920s and featured the fastest-growing population in Oregon. Contributors to this new growth and development included the creation of the Southern Pacific Railroad, completed in 1909. This opened the area for logging and timber business, which became the focus of the profit of the area.Zilverberg, p. 4. The mountain features a United States Forest Service fire lookout tower with an steel tower, built on the summit of Yamsay in 1929. It was removed after the 1970s, and only remnants of the foundation remain today. A dirt road was built to the summit to service the lookout, but this was abandoned after the tower was removed. The upper now form a hiking trail to the summit. Climate and ecology The Cascade Range is dramatically different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars.Wuerthner, p. 74. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral plants such as beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.Wuerthner, p. 76. Diverse life exists within the range, including endangered species like Larch Mountain Salamanders and spotted owls. Amphibians like salamanders and frogs are common, as are birds. Mammals in the area consist of elk, mountain lions, deer, and black bears. Eastern Cascades fish include Lost River suckers and short suckers, which are both endemic species.Wuerthner, p. 77.  Recreation  The Fremont National Recreation Trail passes through the area. It offers tourists excellent views of other Oregon Cascades landmarks, such as Mount Bachelor, the Three Sisters, Mount Thielsen, Mount Scott, and Mount Shasta, . Other activities along the trail include hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking. Yamsay Mountain is also part of a segment of the Oregon Timber Trail known as the Mazama Blowout.

In 2016-17, Manningham Council undertook enabling works at the Park Road end of the trail to allow construction to commence as soon as the sewerage works are completed, with three bridges across the creek being pre- fabricated offsite. This section of the path will be a 2.5 metre-wide concrete surface consisting of three bridges, a 40 metre ramp to span a valley, and several boardwalks. Prior to September 2018, trail users wishing to travel from Schwerkolt Cottage to the lower section and to the Main Yarra Trail at Templestowe were required to detour, either by continuing along the Koonung Creek Trail up to Park Road, then north down Park Road using the on-road bicycle lanes, to the lower section. Alternatively, trail users can continue on the Mullum Mullum Creek Trail from Beckett Road to the Heads Road terminus, climb Heads Road to the south-west, and then continue north down Park Road to the lower section. Due to the steep and narrow nature of Heads Road, in addition to lacking a footpath or bicycle lane, trail users may wish to take the former detour. =Lower section= The lower section starts at Park Road and continues 8.5 km to the Main Yarra Trail and crosses Heidelberg - Warrandyte Road. On the far side is a wooden bridge and boardwalk - continue to the left - the right leads to a tea house at Beasley's Nursery. After 1.1 km the path opens up into a more open area and meets the Greengully Trail that enters from the left (south). The intersection is badly signed. Continue past large open areas on the right (east) where Kangaroos/Wallabies can be seen on a regular basis, just 20 km from the Melbourne CBD. Deer have also been sighted. The trail ends at the confluence of the Mullum Mullum Creek and the Yarra River in Templestowe. A lookout surveys the spot. The Main Yarra Trail starts here. Connections The upper section of the trail at Larissa Ave, Ringwood connects to the Belgrave Rail Trail. The northeastern end of the upper section finishes at Highland Ave, Croydon and has an on-road connection to the Tarralla Creek Trail. The northern end of the lower section connects to the Main Yarra Trail. The path also connects to the Greengully Trail 1.2 km south of the Yarra. The southern end of the lower section terminates at Park Rd. Upper: West end at . East end at . Lower: North end at .

Cross Maroondah Hwy at Kent Ave. Cyclists may utilise the on-road semi- protected bicycle lanes on Kent Ave. Continue onto Main St, Croydon via the level crossing at the roundabout and Croydon War Memorial. Follow Main St to Hewish Rd, where the Tarralla Creek Trail begins at Croydon Park. =Belgrave Rail Trail Connection= Completed in 2013, the Maroondah Council project \\"Lake to Creek Link Project\\"Lake to Creek Link Project improves the link to Ringwood Lake and the Belgrave Rail Trail beyond. At Larissa Ave, follow the trail to the signalised pedestrian crossing of Maroondah Hwy where the trail enters Ringwood Lake. Continue 250m along the southern side of the lake to a narrow turnoff, taking you across the Lilydale railway line and into Bedford Park. Follow the driveway through Bedford Park to Bedford Rd, crossing Bedford Rd at the signalised intersection at the front of Ringwood Secondary College. The Belgrave Rail Trail begins at the southern end of Lena Grove.

The trail now runs all the way from the Yarra River to the Greensborough Bypass and points further north. The trail is badly signed but provides a pleasant environment. Following the path Although there is a sign near the most northerly bend of Punkerri Circuit which declares this as the end of the Trail, the actual track starts further north off an easement, at the most northerly bend of Plenty River Drive, 120 m from Acworth Court. When the path reaches the signed end point, it is well-defined but somewhat rough, narrow and overgrown. Not far down the path is a bus stop, which surprisingly can be found in this heavily-treed area. Further along, past a pipe bridge and 1.6 km later, the Greensborough Bypass bridge spans the valley. On the east side of the road a path goes up to a goat track, which can be used to access the Western Ring Road Trail. The Western Ring Road Trail passes across the bridge on the bridge's north side. Leaving the bridge behind, the path gradually improves and arrives 1 km later at a footbridge. Paths run off in all directions on both sides of the footbridge. Just continue across the footbridge and continue straight ahead across Kalparrin Ave and along the north side of the Whatmough Park oval. On the far side of the oval is a suspension footbridge. There are no signs here. The rule in this case, is always to do a very sharp right turn immediately after crossing the bridge, regardless of from what direction one arrives. Do not go straight ahead. The path goes under Main Street and 800 m later arrives at an apparent dead end at the end of a small street - Bicton Street. Turn right (west) and head along Bicton Street. The path resumes at its far end. Continuing leads to an athletics track, complete with the characteristic red brick colored track. Skirt round the east side of the track and cross a small footbridge on its south side. 2 km later another footbridge appears (near Allima Court). There are no signs here and its possible to lose the trail; maintain a NE - SW direction. Past a stand of large Monkey Puzzle trees and further on to the old Lower Plenty Road iron bridge, built on bluestone supports. Cross the bridge, turn right and go past the Heidelberg golf course and over the final and newest footbridge. The trail moves into a more open area above the Plenty river where horses are kept. The trail goes up and up, past the large transmitter antenna, past the old grain silos in the distance and affords excellent views of the immediate area. It overlooks the ancient floodplain surrounding the confluence of the Plenty and Yarra Rivers. Finally the trail drops about 30 m to the floor of the Yarra valley, to meet with the Yarra River Trail.

Biography =Early life= Wood was born John Royal Wood Nicholson\\"Royal Wood goes from ‚Äòpiecemeal‚Äô to The Beatles to record the right album\\". National Post, July 12, 2012. and raised in Lakefield, Ontario. Royal Wood, his performing name and his real middle names, were chosen in memory of his great-grandfather, Royal Rufus Wood, who died in 1962. Wood grew up in a household filled with music; his brother Luke Nicholson is also a singer-songwriter.\\"Luke Nicholson Releases New Product on April 14\\". Cashbox Canada, February 20, 2017. He began playing piano by ear at the age of four and started lessons at age eight. With the support of his school music program, he had access to a variety of different instruments, and by his teens, he became a multi-instrumentalist well-versed in many different styles, including the guitar, bass guitar, drums, clarinet, and trumpet. After high school, Wood studied business at McGill University. During this time, he performed piano in Montreal jazz clubs and focused on his guitar playing while trying to find his voice as a songwriter. =Career= Wood released his first EP, entitled The Milkweed EP, in 2002. This collection of songs were written, arranged, performed and produced by Wood himself. The release garnered much critical acclaim, and critics drew comparisons with Randy Newman, Jeff Buckley, and Tom Waits. Following the release of his debut EP, Wood set out to create an over-the-top pop record for his full-length debut. Drawing inspiration from The Beatles and The Beach Boys, Wood once again undertook production duties during the recording sessions. In 2004, he released his full-length debut record, Tall Tales on Maple Music. The record's ornate sound and layered arrangements garnered much critical attention, and Wood was praised for his vocal style and infectious lyricism. With the goal of creating a more mature and pristine sound, Wood entered Toronto's Reaction Studios in 2005 to begin recording the follow-up to his full-length debut. During the recording session, he used a Steinway grand piano, scored a full string quartet, and also enlisted the help of many well-known musicians, including Hawksley Workman and Kurt Swinghammer. The result was A Good Enough Day, which was released in 2007 on Dead Daisy Records in Canada, and in 2008 on Rounder Europe. The record spawned three singles and three music videos, \\"A Mirror Without\\", \\"Juliet\\" and \\"I‚Äôm So Glad\\". Music from the record has also been featured on several TV and movie soundtracks, including TMN/Movie Central's ReGenesis, the CBC series This is Wonderland, the CTV movie Playing House, the film The End of Silence, and the Food Network‚Äôs The Surreal Gourmet. Internationally, A Mirror Without was featured on an episode of Grey's Anatomy. His song Paradise was also featured on an episode of Private Practice. With the success of A Good Enough Day, Wood was invited to share the stage with numerous Canadian songstresses, including Emm Gryner, Sarah Harmer, Kathleen Edwards, Sarah Slean, Jill Barber and Serena Ryder. In support of the Rounder Europe release of the record, he also embarked on a European tour in 2008. Constantly evolving, Wood wanted to focus his next effort on the lyrics and string arrangements. The result was the 2009 release The Lost and Found EP. With a consistently growing fan base, Wood embarked on his first headlining tour in Western Canada in November 2009 in support of the new EP, joined by Atlantic Canadian singer-songwriter Rose Cousins. In 2010 he released The Waiting after which he was named iTunes Songwriter of the Year and nominated at the Junos for Songwriter of the Year. He also supported David Gray on a full national tour, and completed three headline tours of Canada, and others in Europe and the US. His 2012 album We Were Born to Glory debuted in the Top 25 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was nominated for Adult Alternative Album of the Year at the 2013 Juno Awards. The first single from the album was \\"Not Giving Up\\". On March 18, 2014, Wood released The Burning Bright. The lead single \\"Forever and Ever\\" was a Top 40 hit in Canada. In June 2014, Wood released the companion album I Wish You Well, which included five new songs and four original mixes from the previous album. The album was a collaboration with Dean Drouillard, while much of the material was inspired by Wood's stay in County Meath, Ireland. Wood released Ghost Light in 2016 to rave reviews. Including the Irish Times naming it one of the \\"Best Albums of the Year\\". The lead single \\"Long Way Out‚Äô found its way into the Radio 2 Top 20. It was released internationally on Outside Music in 2017. The momentum of \\"Ghost Light\\" and Royal's career successes, allowed Royal to be the \\"very special guest\\" on the legendary Bonnie Raitt's national Canadian tour in 2017 to capacity crowds. He released his latest album Ever After the Farewell in April 2018. The lead single \\"California Nights\\" made the Radio 2 Top 20. The world tour highlights included headlining Massey Hall in Toronto, Winspear Centre in Edmonton and the Rebecca Cohn Auditorium in Halifax. A companion EP called Love Will Linger was released on October 26, 2018. Wood is currently on tour in North America and Europe, writing and recording new material with Linda Perry and mixing the Royal Wood ‚Äì Live at Massey Hall album to be released in 2020.

It is part of the community of Mynachlog-ddu. There are prehistoric remains nearby and the parish has a history of slate and clay quarrying.  History  Llangolman lies in a historic landscape near the upper part of the valley of the Eastern Cleddau and its tributaries. The village place name derives from the church dedicated to St. Golman, or in Irish, St Colman. Colman is attributed to Colm√°n of Dromore, a 6th-century saint.  Anglican church  Saint Colman's Church Llangolman church stands on high ground just to the south of the main village. The current building is Victorian or early Victorian, with little to show for the original medieval building that once stood on the site. Of historical interest is the recording in the 19th centuryLapidarium walliae: the early inscribed and sculptured stones of Wales by John Obadiah Westwood of a stone gate post about from the churchyard. This stone, known as the Maen-ar-Golman (the stone upon Colman) is about tall with a number of cross markings carved on the stone. The stone appears to have no inscriptions. The local belief is that Colman is buried nearby.The lives of the British saints: the saints of Wales and Cornwall, Volume 2, Sabine Baring-Gould, John Fisher, Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (London, England) The earliest recorded tombstone in the graveyard is for Stephen Lewis from Llangolman with the date 1778.An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments of Wales and Monmouthshire. VII. (Volume 7) County of Pembroke, London His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1925, The Royal Commission On The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions In Wales and Monmouthshire  Local chapels  Rhydwilym Baptist Chapel There are two local chapels in the area, Llandeilo and Rhydwilym. Rhydwilym (English: William's Ford) is the oldest active Welsh Baptist chapel in the world and was founded in 1668. Funds to build the first chapel were provided by the gentleman farmer John Evans of Llwyndwr in 1701. There was a chapel on the site in 1763; a plaque on the front wall indicates that the 1763 chapel was rebuilt in 1841, and further enlarged in 1875. The current Llandeilo chapel was built in 1882, though earlier chapel structures are recorded in the immediate vicinity. The name Llandeilo comes from the local church dedicated to the 5th-century saint, Teilo.  Historical buildings  Two gentry houses from the 18th century include Plas-y-Meibion and Llangolman Farm. There is also the house called Temple Druid (c. 1795) which was designed by John Nash, architect to King George IV, and is located roughly halfway between Llangolman and Maenclochog. Llangolman Farm has some architectural interest. Although most of the current house probably dates from the 18th century, the rear wing of the house has an older structure that includes barrel vaulting. There are two vaults, one above the other. The lower vault covers the underlying cellar which has three rooms. The end room in the cellar, and deepest, includes a fresh water well. The first room, entered from an open arched doorway, includes square holes in the vaulted ceiling that allowed butter to be easily dropped into the cellar for storage. Above the cellar vault is a second vaulted ceiling that currently houses the bathroom. The farm was a centre of production, including clay, slate, salted bacon, butter and a large mill for grinding corn.  Location and terrain  The area surrounding the village is riddled with steep wooded valleys, presumably cut during one or more of the glacial episodes of the Pleistocene. The village itself sits on a plateau where two valleys meet, the Eastern Cleddau and a tributary that originates near the small village of Llandelio. The underlying geology consists of interbedded Ordovician shales and sandstones with extensive slate outcrops. Evidence of glaciation is also seen from banks of gravel and sand to the east of the village, which form deep drainage seeps from which discharges excellent spring water. The springs emerge in boggy land at the base of the gravel banks, where deposits of blue boulder clay, known by the natives as \\"indiarubber clay\\", can also be found. Clay pits close to the farmhouses of Llangolman Farm (still visible) and Llyn are evidence that the clay was once extracted on a significant scale. The study by Jehu mentions that the clay pit at Llyn was down to a depth of 15 to 20 feet, and ladders were required to get in and out. His report goes on to state that the clay is bluish in color and very tough (hence the nickname indiarubber clay). The clay covers the valley bottom from Llyn to Llangolman Farm at a level of over 400 ft. The valley sides have largely been saved from deforestation due to their steepness, and there is some evidence of old forest along the western side of the Llandelio tributary. Otters have been seen in the rivers. Of historical interest is a surviving and working hydraulic ram that pumps water to the local farm called Ffynnon Sampson (\\"Sampson's Well\\"). Industry The current landscape around the village is entirely rural; the local economy is mostly based on farming (dairy, cattle and sheep) and tourism (bed and breakfasts and rented cottages). Of more interest and of historical importance is the slate quarrying industry. There is a seam of green slate running roughly east‚Äìwest along the Taf Valley. This slate is of volcanic ash origin and of Ordovician date. The slate is generally of a greenish-grey or light blue colour. This slate was often used, in addition to roofing, for covering exposed walls to keep out moisture. Until the 1970s, the outer walls of Llangolman Farm were covered in hanging slates. The slate itself was exploited at least as early as 1860; the largest quarry was Dandderwen quarry (known as Whitland Abbey Slate quarry after the name of the company which exploited it). There is some suggestion that the Gilfach quarry may have been worked as early as the 16th century. It is also claimed that the slate used on the roof of the Houses of Parliament, when rebuilt in the 1830s, originated from the Gilfach quarry. Much of the slate industry went into decline after the 1890s, and by the 1930s most were closed due to competition from cheaper sources. Gilfach quarry on the eastern side of the Eastern Cleddau was still in operation until 1987. There are many smaller workings dotted amongst the landscape; some of the quarries are in the steep-sided valley that carries the western tributary from Llaneilo that joins the Eastern Cleddau; some are near Llangolman Farm, with one immediately north of the farmhouse. Schools There are no schools in Llangolman village. Children from Llangolman would either go to Maenclochog about 2.5 miles away or until 1964 they would walk to the slightly closer school at Nant y Cwm (1.7 miles away). Nant y Cwm closed in 1964 but reopened in 1979 as a Steiner School. Archaeological sites A number of sites at Llangolman are recorded in the 1925 Inventory of Ancient Monuments. One of the most obvious sites still visible today is the Iron Age enclosure located to the south of the village between the farms Bryn Golman and Pencraig Fawr. The site, locally called the Gear (in the field called Gear Meadow) is an enclosure that has a roughly level interior with measurements c.63m E-W and 66m N-S. The bank down-slope side stands up to 2 m high externally and 0.25 m internally. There appears to be a slight ditch on the northeast side. An entrance may be present that faces west. A second highly visible site is an enclosure called Castell Blaenllechog, located just to the west of the farm Pengawsai (itself located to the northwest of the village). It is not certain what the enclosure is, but suggestions include a medieval castle site, a medieval homestead or even an older Iron Age defensive site. What is particularly noticeable are the massive ramparts which stand 3.3 m high. Internally the height is less at about 1.5 m. Traces of a ditch 0.3 m to 0.6 m can be found to the west and south. This enclosure is particularly noticeable on the aerial views from Google Maps.

In addition to AP courses, Ballston Spa offers special college classes, in which students are presented with college level material and may gain credit from local colleges. Although enrollment into the college is not required to take a class, it is required to gain college credit for the class. Students are charged a reduced fee to enroll in the college course. Ballston Spa is also very open-minded in regards to independent studies, including online coursework. IB courses Ballston Spa offers students the International Baccalaureate curriculum as of the fall of 2012. =Requirements= Updated course requirements and more information is provided in the Guidance section of the high school website, available at www.bscsd.org .

Arts Ballston Spa's arts program is and has a large number of motivated student participants. In school students can choose from a wide range of art, music theory/history, and performance oriented classes, which take advantage of Ballston Spa's art facilities, including a dark room, several kilns, and a well-equipped auditorium/theatre. =Performing groups= A number of musical performing groups are offered through the music department, including a Symphonic Band along with an audition-only Wind Ensemble, and aJazz Band directed by Mr. Retersdorf. The Symphonic and Concert Orchestras are directed by Mrs. Reeves. Also, a Concert and Women's Choirs along with the audition- only Select Choir. These groups perform at least twice a year, with concerts in December and May, occasionally performing at a special concert in March. Members from the groups also use their musical talents in the community on a regular basis, organized mainly by Ballston Spa's chapter of the Tri-M Music Honor Society. Members of the band, for example, have performed on the street corners and Maplewood Manor, a local nursing home, around Christmas, while chorus members have gone caroling both in downtown Ballston Spa and at a local respite home. Some also consider the Intro to Theatre and Intro to Acting classes as performing groups, as students in these classes put on a \\"Scene Night\\" for both their midterm and final exams. For Scene Night, students prepare scenes that they either wrote themselves or found in plays that they read, and then perform them live for an audience in January and again in June. =Troupe= Ballston Spa's extracurricular theatre club is known as Troupe, and current director Matthew Lopez puts on two shows a year, the fall show typically being a smaller show or drama and the spring show being a large musical. 2007 marked the retirement of longtime director Pat Pacelli, with whom Larson would switch on and off with. Before Larson joined the district in 2000, Pacelli had been the sole director since the early 1990s. She had acted as first choreographer and then producer for Don Mitola, the previous director, taking over the directing position when he retired. Pacelli herself had attended Ballston Spa, and had been involved in theatre as a student. The Troupe was originally a separate group from the school-sponsored theatre club. Its origin, in 1977, was as a small traveling performance group with the goal of interesting elementary students in theatre. This group was spawned from the highly successful school theatre program, as was the Spa Theatre Company. All of these groups were under the direction of Don Mitola and Harry Smith. In the 1980s the school program adopted the Troupe name and logo as its own. Extracurricular Of note are several academic-related teams. Ballston Spa's Science Olympiad team, advised by physics teachers, placed fourth in regionals for the 2006 season, and has frequently gone to state competitions. Of more recent note, the team placed 3rd at regionals and a new school record of 23rd in states for the 2008 season. The team also finished 3rd in the 2010 season. The Mock Trial team, advised by a history teacher, also has a good record, placing well in the 2006-2007 season. A Biology teacher runs the Envirothon team, which placed very well at states in the 2007 season. Ballston Spa also has an Odyssey of the Mind team. =National Honor Society= The Ballston Spa Chapter of the National Honor Society contains over fifty members from the Junior and Senior classes and is very active in the Ballston Spa community. Student life Throughout the year, student groups sponsor a wide variety of fundraisers and activities, such as the Homecoming Chicken BBQ, Pizza and Wings Night (area pizza places are invited to send in samples, and students vote for their favorite), Amnesty International sponsored Coffeehouses, the Talent Show, the annual Foreign Language Lip-Sync night, a \\"Mr. Ballstonian\\" contest, and Ballstonian Idol (an American Idol parody). These events have been known to gather large audiences and are popular among the students. Dances are held yearly at Ballston Spa. The first two, Homecoming and Fire and Ice (held homecoming weekend and mid-February, respectively), are sponsored by the Congress of Student Legislators, while the Senior Prom is put on in mid- late May, typically at SPAC's Hall of Springs.

Retrieved 28 July 2007. First issued to Australian troops in July 1963, it replaced the Owen machine carbine. Like the Owen, the F1 had a distinctive top mounted magazine. It had a robust and simple design, but \\"never gained popularity with those using it\\" and in Vietnam it was later largely replaced by the American 5.56mm M16A1 rifle. The F1 was retired in the early 1990s and replaced by the F88C Austeyr, an Australian-built version of the Steyr AUG rifle. Some 25,000 were produced by Lithgow from 1962‚Äì73. While the F1 is no longer used by Australia, a shipment of F1s was also donated to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary by Australia. Design details The F1 is a simple blowback design firing from an open bolt with a fixed firing pin. It was designated the X3 while under development.\\"F1 Sub-machine Carbine\\", Lithgow Small Arms Factory Museum It shares many design features with the British Sterling submachine gun. Unlike both the Sterling and its predecessor, the Owen, the F1 has a removable wooden butt and pistol grip. A curved, detachable 34-round box magazine is inserted in a magazine housing on top of the barrel, similar to the earlier Owen gun. It used the same magazine as the Sterling. The top-mounted magazine is unobtrusive for carrying and when lying prone; it also benefits from being less likely to jam than a bottom mounted magazine. The ejection port is directly under the magazine and provides a trap for the unwary user; should the user's hand stray back to the port, the bolt moving forwards will 'bite' the web of the hand. The butt-plate and pistol- grip are identical to those on the L1A1 SLR as well as the capability of adapting SLR bayonets. However, it was mostly used with a detachable spike bayonet fitted on the right side of the barrel jacket. The trigger is a two- stage pull, half back semi auto, pull and hold back gives full auto requiring a safety catch only easily operated by the thumb. There is a small guard fitted forward of the ejection port to protect the forward hand. The left- mounted cocking handle has a tab that, when pressed, locks into the bolt, enabling it to be worked backwards and forwards to clear fouling. The pistol grip with internal parts came from the production line of the SLR L1A1 rifle, at the Lithgow factory. The wooden butt also was from the SLR production line, reducing the amount of tooling. Stripping is simple: Safety on, remove magazine, cock and hold bolt open, rotate to left, inspect bolt face and chamber, release bolt under control. Then grab butt, press catch on bottom of receiver with other hand, rotate butt to left 90-degree and pull off. Remove spring, release safety, tip barrel up and pull so that the trigger bolt slides out. Assemble in reverse. Suggested ranges for use were 25 meters from the hip snap shooting 100 meters using sights. Because of the vertical magazine the sights of the F1 were offset to the right of the weapon requiring a slight head tilt to the right, the rear sight being a roughly triangular asymmetrical metal flap with a round aperture, the front sight being a blade mounted on the right side of the weapon's magazine well.

Unlike pneumatic tires which use a separate inner tube, tubeless tires have continuous ribs molded integrally into the bead of the tire so that they are forced by the pressure of the air inside the tire to seal with the flanges of the metal rim of the wheel. History Many patents had been filed covering tubeless tires. Killen Tire applied for a patent in 1928 and was granted in the UK in 1930. The Wingfoot Corporation, a subsidiary of Goodyear Tire were granted a patent in South Africa in 1944. Due to technical problems, most of these designs saw only limited production or were abandoned. Frank Herzegh working for BF Goodrich applied for a patent in 1946 and eventually received in 1952 in the United States. By 1955 tubeless tires became standard equipment on new cars. BF Goodrich had to defend their patent in court several times, due to the similarities of previous designs. The primary difference between the BF Goodrich design and their predecessors was the usage of butyl rubber, which was more resistant to air leakage than the natural rubber used in the other designs. Safety Traditional designs of pneumatic tires required a separate inner tube which could fail for a number of reasons, such as incorrect tire fit, friction between the tire wall and inner tube generating excess heat, or a puncture. Tubeless tire technology does away with the need for an inner tube thereby increasing safety. In a tubeless tire, the tire and the rim of the wheel form an airtight seal, with the valve being directly mounted on the rim. If a tubeless tire gets a small puncture, air escapes only through the hole, leading to a gentle deflation. Conversely, a tubed tire, with an inner tube, could potentially burst like a balloon, leading to deflation of the tire which could result in sudden loss of control of the vehicle. However, the \\"bursting like a balloon\\" scenario is highly unlikely due to fact that the inner tube is inside of the tire and will deflate at a rate proportional to the puncture hole size. In antique automobiles, made before the mid 1950s, the rims are not designed for tubeless tires, and an inner tube is required to prevent slow leaks at the bead. Tire sealants Liquid tire sealant can be injected into tubeless tires to prevent deflation in case of small punctures, although there is controversy regarding its compatibility with direct tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) that employ sensors mounted inside the tire. Some manufacturers of sealants assert that their products are indeed compatible, but others warned that, e.g., the \\"sealant may come in contact with the sensor in a way that renders the sensor TEMPORARILY inoperable until it is properly cleaned, inspected and re-installed by a tire care professional\\". Such doubts are also reported by others. Use of such sealants may void the TPMS sensor warranty. Bicycle tires A tubeless bicycle tire system requires a compatible tire, an airtight rim‚Äîcapable of being sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they go all the way through the rim) and the tire bead seat. The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle. =UST= UST or Universal System Tubeless is a rim designed by Mavic with hooked edges designed to seal with specially designed tires. Several companies such as Michelin and Hutchinson make tires compatible with UST rims. UST was the first tubeless system for bicycles. Other companies such as Stan‚Äôs NoTubes, Bontrager, DT Swiss, and WTB have their own similar system called Tubeless Ready. =Road tubeless= In 2006, Shimano and Hutchinson introduced a tubeless system for road bicycles. Tubeless tires have not yet gained popular acceptance in road racing due to lack of sponsorship, the tradition of using tubular tires and the fact that, even without the innertube, the combined weight of tubeless rims and tires is more than top-of-the-line tubular tire wheelsets. Road tubeless is gaining popularity among riders for whom the benefits are worth the costs.

Hamlet is reflecting, at first admiringly, and then despairingly, on the human condition. The speech The monologue, spoken in the play by Prince Hamlet to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Act II, Scene 2, follows in its entirety. Rather than appearing in blank verse, the typical mode of composition of Shakespeare's plays, the speech appears in straight prose: Meaning Hamlet is saying that although humans may appear to think and act \\"nobly\\" they are essentially \\"dust\\". Hamlet is expressing his melancholy to his old friends over the difference between the best that men aspire to be, and how they actually behave; the great divide that depresses him. Differences between texts The speech was fully omitted from Nicholas Ling's 1603 First Quarto, which reads simply: This version has been argued to have been a bad quarto, a tourbook copy, or an initial draft. By the 1604 Second Quarto, the speech is essentially present but punctuated differently: Then, by the 1623 First Folio, it appeared as: J. Dover Wilson, in his notes in the New Shakespeare edition, observed that the Folio text \\"involves two grave difficulties\\", namely that according to Elizabethan thought angels could apprehend but not act, making \\"in action how like an angel\\" nonsensical, and that \\"express\\" (which as an adjective means \\"direct and purposive\\") makes sense applied to \\"action\\", but goes very awkwardly with \\"form and moving\\".The New Shakespeare: Hamlet. Cambridge University Press, 1968. These difficulties are remedied if we read it thus: Sources A source well known to Shakespeare is Psalm 8, especially verse 5: \\"You have made [humans] a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned them with glory and honor.\\" Scholars have pointed out this section's similarities to lines written by Montaigne: However, rather than being a direct influence on Shakespeare, Montaigne may have merely been reacting to the same general atmosphere of the time, making the source of these lines one of context rather than direct influence.Knowles, Ronald. \\"Hamlet and Counter-Humanism.\\" Renaissance Quarterly 52.4 (1999): 1046-69.

This was the fourth year in succession that the Polish entry featured multiple languages; however, only in 2003 had the entry (also performed by Ich Troje) featured more than two languages. Musically, the song is inspired by the Eurodance style of the 1990s, a style with which Real McCoy (the name only being applied to \\"O-Jay\\" Jeglitza following the dissolution of the band) is associated. In keeping with this style, Ich Troje's verses and choruses are sung, while Jeglitza performs a rap somewhat reminiscent of his band's earlier hit \\"Come And Get Your Love\\". Lyrically, Jeglitza begins with a bilingual (Spanish and English) rap in which he tells a girl that \\"you're the one for me/Your love made me a believer\\" and asks her to \\"take my gasolina\\". Micha≈Ç Wi≈õniewski then sings in Polish, begging his lover to \\"let me at least touch your hands\\", and tells her \\"I'll get to your heart, do you want it?\\" At this point, the lyrics switch to English, and feature all the members of Ich Troje singing that they will follow their hearts in order to be guided towards their lovers. After another Spanish rap from Jeglitza, Wi≈õniewski switches to German to sing that love can enable one to see the truth, before the band then sings in Russian that one must always listen to one's heart. The final chorus is then delivered in English again. At the Contest, the members of Ich Troje were dressed flamboyantly in costumes inspired by European aristocracy of the 18th century. A number of them also wore or carried masquerade masks, continuing with the lyrical theme of masking one's true feelings. Unusually, Jeglitza performed his parts from among the audience, rather than onstage with the rest of the group, only joining them at the end of the song. Wi≈õniewski ended the performance by bending down to draw attention to his wife Wi≈õniewska's pregnancy. As Poland had not ended the 2005 Contest in the top ten, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed twelfth (following Macedonia's Elena Risteska with \\"Ninanajna\\" and preceding Russia's Dima Bilan with \\"Never Let You Go\\"). At the close of voting, it had received 70 points, placing 11th in a field of 23 and missing out on qualification for the final by one place (and 6 points), thus requiring Poland to qualify through the semi-final at the next Contest. It was succeeded as Polish representative at the 2007 Contest by The Jet Set with \\"Time To Party\\".

During the training period, the participant is known as a trainee solicitor'What is a training contract?', Chambers Student or trainee lawyer (in Singapore). A training contract can apply to any profession. In some 21st-century contracts, a small number of contracts are secured by an Agency who represent many training professionals. Otherwise training contracts can be negotiated locally. United Kingdom In the UK a full-time training contract is normally for two years. While trainees in England and Wales will normally have first completed the Legal Practice Course, some are also completing the LPC as part-time students alongside their practical training. In Scotland, future solicitors will instead study the Diploma in Professional Legal Practice before commencing their traineeship. Trainee solicitors and training contracts were formerly known as articled clerks and articles of clerkship, respectively. In the UK, the barrister's equivalent is a twelve-month pupillage under a pupilmaster, in barristers' chambers. =Route= To obtain a training contract (since 1 July 2014 a training contract is now formally known as 'period of recognised training'https://www.sra.org.uk/trainees/period-recognised-training.page), a graduate must apply for an opening for such position at a law firm or in-house legal team. Law firms often recruit a year or two in advance of the start of planned employment, allowing non-law graduates to complete the academic prerequisites of the Graduate Diploma in Law and the Legal Practice Course before starting their training contract. Some in-house legal teams prefer recruiting trainees ad-hoc or promoting existing legal assistants and paralegals that have proven themselves.https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/blog/docs/default-source/in-house- documents/best-practice-guide-for-inhouse-contracts---2-august-2019.pdf Many law firms offer vacation schemes (one- or two-week internships) as a way of assessing candidates for training contracts. The vacation schemes usually involve real work in one of the firm's departments, various assessment exercises and an interview. Vacation scheme attendees are normally paid. A concern of the profession is that each year the number of applicants exceeds the number of contracts available. Graduates unable to obtain a training contract will have accrued sizeable debts with no guarantee of being able to qualify as a lawyer other than by way of the poorly documented, and relatively recent Equivalent Means route.https://www.sra.org.uk/students/resources/equivalent-means-information- pack/ In years past, it was common for aspiring lawyers to pay law firms to train them (a practice also common in other professions in the past, including officer positions in the Royal Navy as well as pilot training in civil aviation). = Structure = A training contract at larger commercial firms is usually divided into \\"seats\\" of four or six months each - rotations or placements within different departments of a law firm, ensuring that the trainee can build up experience in both contentious and advisory/transactional legal work. Some in-house legal teams and smaller firms employ a non- rotational training contract instead.https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/blog/docs/default-source/in-house- documents/best-practice-guide-for-inhouse-contracts---2-august-2019.pdf It may also involve a client secondment, where the trainee is placed with a client's in-house legal team, or an international secondment to an office of the law firm situated abroad. =Legal executives= For a legal executive, who normally does not hold a law degree, a training contract is not normally required to qualify as a solicitor. They typically advance toward qualification by passing exams administered by the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx), while working under the supervision of a solicitor.

Doty (born 1950) is an American composer and authority on just intonation. He is the author of The Just Intonation Primer (1993, 1994, 2002). Inspired in part by the work of Harry Partch, Doty began composing in 1970 and in 1975 co-founded the San Francisco-based ensemble Other Music with Henry S. Rosenthal and Dale S. Soules. After Doty studied intonation with Lou Harrison, members of Other Music built an American gamelan based on a 14-tone-per-octave just tuning designed by Doty and Soules (see Syst√™ma Ametabolon for comparison). Other Music performed extensively in Northern California using these instruments during the years 1977‚Äì1981. Three of Doty's compositions from this period were featured on Other Music's 1980 LP Prime Numbers. Other Music ceased performing publicly in 1981, but in 1983 recorded and released a studio album, Incidents Out of Context, featuring compositions combining gamelan with synthesizers and other acoustic and electro-acoustic instruments. After the dissolution of Other Music in 1983, Doty began composing for MIDI instruments and sequencers, which he has continued to do into the 21st century. Seven of these compositions in just intonation are included on his 1998 solo CD Uncommon Practice on Syntonic Records. In 1984, Doty cofounded the Just Intonation Network along with a number of other Northern California just intonation composers and theorists. He served as the editor of the network's journal 1/1 from its inception in 1985 until 2006. Doty has also been a technical writer and editor and author of computer books, and is an environmental activist. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

The seller was then a client of the broker.Brokerage relationship types However, no such agency relationship existed with the buyer, and the broker's agents helped the buyer (who was typically known as his or her \\"customer\\"). In this situation, during the entire period in which the buyer looked at properties, entered into a real estate contract, and finally closed on one, that broker/agent functioned solely as the sub-agent of the seller‚Äôs broker. Some clear disadvantages exist for the buyer under sub-agency. There is no obligation to obtain the best price or terms for the buyer, since the broker, as sub-agent, was obligated to obtain the best terms for the seller, generally someone who he/she had never met and with whom no direct business relationship existed. Many states, notably FloridaFlorida statute outlining types of representation available and Colorado, Colorado: Types of brokerage outlined have abolished sub-agency in favor of written Buyer Brokerage Agreements or the creation of Transaction Brokerage. It was only with the advent of Buyer brokerage in the 1990s - the legal representation of a buyer by a broker - that a buyer became a client of the broker and entered into the same fiduciary relationship enjoyed by the seller.Unit 2 - Law of Agency In the Philippines, a Sub-Agent is someone who is under the supervision and operational control of a Real Estate Broker. The Sub-Agent is not an agent of the Buyer or Seller. It is the Broker who is the Agent of the Buyer or Seller. The Sub-Agent is an agent of the Broker, works for the Broker, and represents the interest of the Broker. The formal position of a Sub-Agent in the hierarchy of real estate practitioners in the Philippines is equivalent to the rank of Salesperson.

Early years John Dolbeer was born in Epsom, Merrimack County, New Hampshire on March 12, 1827, the son of Nicholas Dolbeer and Esther Chase of New Rye. He left the family farm in 1850 at the age of 23 and set out to the California Gold Rush to make his fortune. Entrepreneurship Looking for opportunity beyond the mines, Dolbeer arrived at the Humboldt Bay area where in 1853 he purchased Martin White's Bay Mill in Eureka, California. Finding himself in need of capital after fire destroyed his mill twice, he became partners with William Carson (builder of the Carson Mansion) by the spring of 1863. The two formed what would become one of the first truly huge Redwood lumber operations, the Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company.The National Park Service, The Redwood Lumber Industry, 1850-1953 The Lumber Industry in Humboldt County, 1850-1860 Url retrieved September 30, 2008. The mill operated with his name on it on the Eureka waterfront until the 1970s. Patents \\"Logging Engine\\" Patent 256,553 His several patents showed his ingenuity in problem solving, and he had an impact in all facets of the industry, from the actual lumbering operation itself, to transporting and exporting ‚Äì even owning the barques and brigs to ship the lumber to worldwide markets. Among his most useful and successful patent was that for the Dolbeer Logging Engine in August 1881.Richard L. Williams, The Loggers, (New York: Time-Life Books, 1976), 112‚Äì113; This machine was a simple steam engine mounted on a wooden skid which enabled loggers to employ cables to move giant logs across long distances or steep terrain to adjacent railways or waterways. This invention improved log retrieval in difficult terrain and revolutionized the industry. It was so cost effective and useful that the technology continued to be used well into the 20th century. Examples of working Donkey engines can still be found operating during special occasions at Fort Humboldt State Historic Park in Eureka. The patent (Patent number: 256553) was issued April 18, 1882. Other patents include an apparatus for \\"steaming piles\\" (Patent number: 333204) and a device used for measuring footage of timber cut by a sawmill (Patent number: 45482). Family In 1872, late in life, he married Harriet Schander, and in 1873 his son, Chase Dolbeer was born. He established his home on Lombard Street in San Francisco. Four years later, in 1877, the Dolbeers had their daughter, Bertha. Business continued to thrive, despite early lumber mill fires. It was about the time of the second fire that the personal life of Jonathan Dolbeer turned tragic. In 1879, Harriet committed suicide and was called by the San Francisco Call \\"a suffering invalid\\", and in 1886 his son Chase was thrown from a wagon and died at the age of 13. His family endured yet a final tragedy after his death when on July 9, 1904, his daughter Bertha committed suicide at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City, putting the battle for the estate in the California Courts through 1908.San Francisco County CA Biography Project Estate John Dolbeer died in San Francisco from a heart ailment on August 17, 1902. He was laid to rest in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park, Colma, San Mateo County, California.Find A Grave - Cypress Lawn Memorial Park The bulk of his estate went to his lone surviving daughter Bertha, and was worth nearly one million dollars. Additional sums were given to several charities, and relatives in Epsom, including his niece Ellen Dolbeer Hall (daughter of his brother Calvin) and her husband, Charles Sumner Hall. There is now a prestigious scholarship awarded at the University of California, Berkeley in his name and honor.

The 450 production tanks saw service from 1934 to 1941, last seeing action in Finland.Alkett VsKfz 617/NK-101 Minenr√§umer in display at the Kubinka Military Museum ;Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B: After initial service the Ausf A was found to be underpowered and the engine prone to overheating. A more powerful engine was fitted and the superstructure transferred to the longer chassis of the kl Pz Bef Wg to produce the Ausf B, a.k.a. LaS Maybach, seeing service from 1935-1943, latterly as a command tank. ;Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf C: The Ausf C light tracked reconnaissance vehicle, a.k.a. PzKpfW I nA or VK601, was a comprehensive re-design of the Pz I, with little commonality with earlier Ausfuhrungen introducing the Schachtellaufwerk (inter-leaved track wheels) used in many later Panzers. One of the machine guns was replaced by a semi-automatic Einbauwaffe 141 anti-tank rifle chambered in 7.92√ó94mm Patronen, giving it limited anti-armor capability. Forty Ausf C were built, two being sent to the Eastern Front for evaluation, the remainder were in action during the Normandy invasion of 1944.http://worldoftanks.asia/en/tankopedia/PzI_ausf_C/ ;Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf F: The Ausf F heavily armoured infantry assault tank (MG armed), a.k.a. PzKpfW I nA verst√§rkt or VK1801, was an up-armoured Pz I with the Schachtellaufwerk (inter-leaved track wheels) of the Ausf C, and a turret mounting two machine-guns. Thirty Ausf F tanks were built between April and December 1942, eight of which were sent to the Eastern Front for evaluation. Specialised vehicles ;Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf A ohne Aufbau: The first Panzer I vehicles to be built, 15 of this variant were completed by various firms (Daimler-Benz, Henschel, Krupp, MAN, and Rheinmetall) in a program intended to develop industrial capacity and provide initial training vehicles to the Wehrmacht. The Ausf A ohne Aufbau was a Panzer I hull without any superstructure or turret. The interior was completely open. The vehicle was crewed by a student driver and instructor, with room for three student observers behind them. The suspension and hull were identical to the Ausf A, but total weight was reduced to 3.5 tons and height to 1.15 m. Performance was similar. Munitionsschlepper on Panzer I Ausf A chassis ;Munitionsschlepper auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf A: Given the designation Sd.Kfz. 111, the Munitionsschlepper (ammunition tractor) was built to provide Panzer units with an armored tracked vehicle for front-line re-supply of tanks. 51 examples were converted from older Ausf A tanks in September 1939. The conversion involved removing the turret and providing a two-piece armor plate cover over the resulting opening. This crude conversion served in Poland and France with Panzer units. Total weight was a little less than the Ausf A, at 5.0 tons, and the height was reduced to 1.4 m. Since some fuel capacity was removed, range was cut to 95 km. No armament was provided. A Br√ºckenleger I model ;Br√ºckenleger auf Fgst Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf A: An attempt to mount bridging equipment on the Ausf A chassis proved impractical due to the weak suspension of the vehicle, although this was later tried with greater success on the Panzer II chassis. ;Flammenwerfer auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf A: A simple field modification, the Flammenwerfer had a portable flamethrower with enough fuel for about 10 seconds of firing at a range of up to 25 m mounted in place of one of the machine guns. The idea came from an experiment during the Spanish Civil War, and was intended to give the Panzer I more firepower against close targets. The conversion was not permanent, and was only reported to be used in the Battle of Tobruk by the German 5th Light Division. Panzerbefehlswagen on Panzer I Ausf. B chassis ;Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen (kl Pz Bef Wg): Given the designation Sd.Kfz. 265, the kl Pz Bef Wg was a modification of the Ausf A designed to provide a command vehicle for Panzer units. This required lengthening the chassis (by adding a fifth road wheel) and upgrading the engine. Ultimately, this chassis would be the basis for the improved Ausf B version. The klPzBefWg had a built-up superstructure in place of the turret, affording more interior room for command equipment and a FuG6 radio in addition to the FuG2. A single MG13 or MG34 in a ball mount on the front of the superstructure was provided, although often removed. Slightly heavier (5.9 tons) and taller (1.99 m) than the Ausf B, the klPzBefWg served with all Panzer units into the early war years. It received an additional 15 mm of armor later, and was moved to auxiliary duties by 1942. 184 were built by Daimler-Benz at the same time as Ausf B production, and six examples were built from Ausf A tanks. ;Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B ohne Aufbau: The Ausf B ohne Aufbau used the same chassis as the Ausf B, but omitted the superstructure and turret. Designed to provide Panzer units with a tracked recovery and repair vehicle, 164 were produced alongside the standard Ausf B vehicles. However, the introduction of larger tanks meant it was unable to do recovery work, and by 1940 it was being transferred to training duties. Compared to the Ausf B, it was much lighter (4.0 tons) and shorter (1.35 m). Like the Ausf A ohne Aufbau, the compartment was open-topped; the hull was armored. ;4.7 cm PaK (t) (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B: Commonly known as the Panzerj√§ger I, this version marked Germany's first attempt at an armored tank destroyer. The turret was removed and a 4.7 cm PaK (t) antitank gun (captured from Czechoslovakia) with a tall wrap-around gun shield was installed. Made from 14.5 mm thick armor plate, the shield offered no protection to the rear or above. The gun was capable of 35¬∞ of traverse and elevation from ‚àí8¬∞ to +12¬∞. 86 rounds were carried for the main gun. While performance was similar to the Ausf B, it was heavier at 6.4 tons and taller, 2.25 m, than the B. Pz.Kpfw. I Ausf. B light tank ;15 cm sIG 33 (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B: This vehicle was sometimes known as the Bison. The larger Ausf B chassis made possible the mounting of heavier guns with removal of the turret. The largest was the 150 mm heavy infantry gun, the sIG 33. This mammoth piece was relatively short and barely fit inside a tall superstructure that was constructed up to the vehicle's 2.8 m height and over the tracks to their full 2.06 m width. The superstructure armor was light‚Äîonly 13 mm‚Äîand only protected the front and sides. The heavy resulting weight of 8.5 tons overstressed the chassis; the vehicle was not a great success. 38 were converted from Ausf B tanks in February 1940. They served with six heavy SP infantry gun companies, with survivors in service into 1943. The sIG mounting was capable of 25 ¬∞ of traverse and 75 ¬∞ of elevation, and could be depressed to ‚àí4 ¬∞. It used a Rblf36 sight. Ammunition was carried separately, there being no room for onboard shell storage. The sIG would be mounted more successfully on larger chassis as the war progressed. ;Flammenwerfer auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf A: A field modification, similar to that done to the Ausf B earlier in Spain, developed in preparation for the assault on Tobruk, by the 5th le division (5th Light Division) field engineers of the Deutsche Afrika Korps, and issued to the 5th Tank Regiment. the flamethrower was capable of 10 - 12 one second bursts up to . ;Flammenwerfer auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B: An experimental field modification similar to that done to the Ausf A later in North Africa, this conversion was made during the Spanish Civil War. There is no record of later use during World War II. ;Ladungsleger auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B / Abwurfvorrichtung auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B: A field modification kit, the Ladungsleger and Abwurfvorrichtung, explosives layer, were mounted on the rear deck of an Ausf B tank and used to lay explosives to defeat field fortifications. A number of vehicles were given these kits, with authorized use on the armoured engineers company of each Pioneer Battalion. ;Flakpanzer I: A rare modification that attempted to make the Panzer I into a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun was the Flakpanzer I that was not produced widely due to limited operational utility.

Located at 3700 Dutchman's Lane, the synagogue offers Shabbat and Yom Tov services. Prayer services are conducted in Nusach Ashkenaz. History The congregation was founded by a group of Russian Jewish immigrants in June 1893. In 1897 and 1898 it occupied a private home owned by Jacob Brownstein on Eighth Street, and for the next few years met in a three-story building at 716 W. Walnut Street (now called Muhammad Ali Boulevard). In 1903 it purchased the former B'rith Sholom synagogue at 511 South First Street. This building no longer exists, but it was located at a spot that would be across First Street from what is today The Brown School. The synagogue was forced to move due to the construction of the I-65 interstate highway. The synagogue purchased a lot adjacent to the Jewish Community Center and held its groundbreaking ceremony in April 1957. In 1971 Anshei Sfard absorbed another Orthodox congregation, Agudath Achim, bringing its membership up to 300 families. When another Orthodox congregation, Keneseth Israel, became Conservative in 1994, Anshei Sfard remained as the only Orthodox congregation in Louisville. In May 2019, the synagogue has been renting space from Shalom Towers which is located behind the synagogue's previous location which was sold to the Jewish Community of Louisville. Congregation Anshei Sfard continues to have daily services in its new location under the leadership of Rabbi Simcha Snaid. Rabbinic leadership In 1903 the Orthodox synagogues in Louisville, under the umbrella of a Vaad HaEr (community council), hired a chief rabbi to act as spiritual leader for all of the city's synagogues, in addition to supervising kashrut, a mikveh, and a Talmud Torah. In the 1910s Anshei Sfard went ahead and hired its own rabbi, Rabbi Z. Klavansky, which caused it to be snubbed by the chief rabbi and the other Orthodox congregations in the city. A second synagogue hired its own rabbi in 1927, causing further divisiveness in the city. The post of chief rabbi of Louisville was finally abolished in 1937. From 1930 to 1945 the congregation was led by Rabbi Charles Chavel, who went on to produce acclaimed critical editions of classical Jewish commentators on the Bible and Talmud. He was succeeded by Rabbi Solomon Roodman, who served from 1946 to 1989. Rabbi Avrohom Litvin took the helm in 1989. Rabbi Litvin resigned in 2013 after 25 years citing infighting and the need for growth and acceptance.Anshei Sfard Bulletin, August 2013 The next designated spiritual leader, was Dr. Joshua Golding, a Professor of Philosophy at Bellarmine University, specializing in philosophy of religion and Jewish philosophy. In 2016 the congregation chose Rabbi Simcha Snaid as its leader who received rabbinical ordination in 2017.

The plot follows a wealthy family who have stopped practicing their Muslim faith are tormented by the undead after their mother dies. It has achieved cult status among fans of Asian horror films; principally because it has been unavailable for many years except as an obscure Japanese VHS pressing with no English subtitles. In 2006, Brentwood Home Video, a specialist US label, released an uncut print on DVD for retail release as part of its Eastern Horror series.http://www.cnnindonesia.com/hiburan/20170421180243-220-209327/joko- anwar-bikin-hantu-seram-pengabdi-setan-tanpa-komputer/ Among Western fans It is notable for being one of the few classic horror films to substitute Christian or Buddhist themes for Muslim beliefs. The film bears a resemblance in plot to Don Coscarelli's 1979 film Phantasm. A remake, directed by Joko Anwar, was released on September 28, 2017 and it was a box office success and was met with critical acclaim. In May, 2020, Severin Films released Satan's Slave on Blu-ray with a new scan of the original negative and new interviews with Producer Gope T. Samtani, Screenwriter Imam Tantowi, and remake director Joko Anwar. Plot Mawarti, the mother, who dies from mysterious illness, leaves behind her work-obsessed businessman husband Munarto, quiet and introverted son Tomi, party girl and extroverted daughter Rita, and their sickly but religious servant Mr. Karto. On the first night after Mawarti's death, Tomi sees his dead mother, but he does not talk to her. The next day, Tomi takes the advice of his friend and visits a fortune teller, who warns that his whole family is in great danger and may die, and advises him to fortify himself with black magic. Tomi becomes strange and withdrawn. Rita's boyfriend, Herman, says that for 40 days after a person dies, that person's spirit will linger at the house. Shortly after Herman‚Äôs visit, a new housekeeper named Darminah arrives, allegedly sent by an acquaintance of their father to look after the house. That night, after a party, Rita is scared when she sees a kuntilanak. Herman warns that Darminah is not the kind of person to be trusted, and offers to consult a shaman about the situation the next day. Mr. Karto also begins to notice her strange and suspicious behavior. Tomi meets with a kyai at a bookstore, who advises him to begin performing his religious prayers, but when he tries to begin, a kuntilanak appears and commands him to stop. The next day, Tomi finds Mr. Karto's corpse, hung. Later that day, Herman is also killed when he is run over by a truck after nearly colliding with the mysterious Darminah. That night, Tomi and Rita agree that the ghosts in their home must be removed. When Rita leaves, she is chased by the now-undead Herman. The next morning, Rita and Tomi tell their father to call a shaman, who does so. Upon his arrival, the hired shaman is attacked by broken glass and flower petals. Rita, Tomi, and Munarto watch as the shaman's head is impaled and pelted by a spinning chandelier. When everything is over, Darminah sneaks out, but Tomi follows her to the cemetery, where the sinister housekeeper meets with the now-undead Herman and Mr. Karto and then raises Mawarti, ordering her to kill her family. When they notice Tomi spying on them, they give chase, but he escapes. At home, Tomi immediately warns his father and sister about Darminah. Rita believes him, but their father dismisses his warning. He takes them to check Darminah's room, but she is somehow already there. The next day, the siblings dig up their mother's grave to confirm that her body is still there. When they return, the entire family is assaulted by the undead: Herman pursues Rita, Mr. Karto haunts Tomi, and Mawarti harasses Munarto. They escape into the dining room, only to find Darminah there holding a skull and frizzy hair. It is revealed that Darminah is a demon who preys on those of weak Islamic faith. After being terrorized and dying without repentance, those people become slaves to the devil in hell. The family runs to the front door and opens it to flee, only to discover the kyai and his supporters there to help. Together, they confront Darminah and the three zombies with the letter of the Qur'an, which sets them all on fire. The film ends with Munarto, Tomi, and Rita, all newly re-converted to Islam, returning from the mosque to their car. The camera reveals that the woman in the car next to them is Darminah. Cast * W.D.

Merrill Jr. Found His Path as an Educator and Philanthropist ‚Äì November 29, 2017) was an American educator, author, and philanthropist, best known for supporting historically black colleges and founding the Commonwealth School in Boston. Early life Merrill was the son of Charles E. Merrill, one of the founders of Merrill Lynch, the stock brokerage and investment banking firm. Merrill was the second of two children born to Charles E. Merrill and his first wife, Elizabeth Church Merrill. He was the younger brother of Doris Merrill Magowan (1916‚Äì2001), and the half-sibling to the poet James Merrill (1926‚Äì1995). He spent his childhood and adolescence in New York City. He attended Deerfield Academy and graduated from Harvard College. Merrill was the recipient of a Fulbright grant which he used to teach in Austria. Military service Merrill was conscripted into the military during World War II. He served in the Fifth United States Army in North Africa, Italy, and Germany through the end of the war. One of the stories emanating from this experience was Merrill's involvement in rescuing a teenaged Jewish boy he encountered in Germany named Bernat Rosner. Rosner was orphaned by the Holocaust and was befriended by Merrill. Merrill assisted Rosner to emigrate to the United States. Merrill sponsored Rosner's education and eventually Rosner attended Harvard Law School and became General Counsel of Safeway Stores, Inc., the grocery story chain founded by the senior Charles E. Merrill and run by Merrill's brother-in-law Robert Anderson Magowan. Rosner's life was recounted in a book named Uncommon Friendship: From Opposite Sides of the Holocaust (University of California Press, 2001). Educator and philanthropist Merrill founded the Commonwealth School in Boston in 1958. Housed in two connected townhouses in Boston's Back Bay at the corner of Commonwealth Avenue and Dartmouth Street, the school was personally funded and staffed by Merrill from its beginnings. He retired as the headmaster of the school in 1981. The school was a reflection of Merrill's principles. His goal was to provide a rigorous classical education to minority students and the less fortunate, heavy on history, English, and writing; Merrill himself taught Bible class to the entire class of ninth graders, not from a religious perspective but from a humanistic one. He also maintained the principles of Yankee frugality, requiring students to participate in the upkeep of the school, from bussing tables and washing dishes at lunch to emptying trash baskets at the end of the day. His generosity was quiet but overflowing; it was not unusual for Merrill to foot the tuition bills, even college tuition, for students who were financially distressed. Commonwealth School was not Merrill's first foray into high school education. He also was one of the co-founders of the Thomas Jefferson School in St. Louis in 1946. Merrill's philanthropy extended to several other institutions of higher education. Merrill was the Chairman of the Charles E. Merrill Trust, the charitable foundation named after his father. The Merrill Trust donated the money used to endow Merrill College at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1968. Merrill also served for more than 15 years as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Morehouse College, the historically black college in Atlanta. Merrill Hall on the Morehouse campus was dedicated in his name to honor his many contributions to the school. He also served on Boards of Marlboro College in Vermont and Hampshire College in western Massachusetts. He has taught semesters at Guilford College, Moravian College, Spelman College, and Warren Wilson College. Personal life Despite great personal wealth derived from an unbreakable trust made early in his childhood, Merrill lived modestly.Merrill, James. A Different Person: A Memoir, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993, Chapter I. \\"As it happened, my father had taken a much earlier step to ensure his children's independence, by creating an unbreakable trust in each of our names. Thus at five years old I was rich, and would hold my own pursestrings when I came of age, whether I liked it or not. I wasn't sure I did like it. The best-intentioned people, knowing whose son I was and powerless against their own snobbery, could set me writhing under attentions I had done nothing to merit.\\" Reprinted in Collected Prose, Knopf, 2004, p. 461. Before his father's death, Merrill and his two siblings renounced any further inheritance from their father's estate in exchange for $100 \\"as full quittance\\";Merrill, James. A Different Person: A Memoir. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993, Chapter XVI; reprinted in Collected Prose, Knopf, 2004, pp. 619-620. as a result, much of Charles Merrill Sr.'s estate was donated to his namesake trust. James Merrill dedicated his 1985 collection of poems Late Settings \\"for my sister Doris and my brother Charles.\\" (His 1957 novel The Seraglio, widely read as a portrait of Charles E. Merrill's womanizing ways, was dedicated to the poet's ten nephews and nieces.) James Merrill shared with his brother a lifelong love of opera, an experience he wrote about in his 1993 memoir, A Different Person. Merrill married his high school sweetheart, Mary White Klohr, in 1942. It was a happy marriage which produced five children and lasted until her death in 1999. Unlike his father, Merrill Jr. was a modest, unassuming man who was faithful to his wife and dedicated to his family. Merrill then married Julie Boudreaux, who survived him. Later years Merrill wrote an account of his experiences of founding and leading Commonwealth School for 23 years in a book called The Walled Garden (Rowan Tree Press 1982). Merrill was an internationalist, and his travels have taken him to the former Soviet satellite states of Czechoslovakia and Poland, as well as the other countries of Central Europe, as well as Eastern Europe. He wrote about these travels in a book called The Journey. Other books written by Merrill are: The Trip to Paris, Emily's Year, The Great Ukrainian Partisan Movement, and The Checkbook. He helped start the Foundation for Educational Support (Fondacija za podrsku obrazovanju) in Lukavac, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He often spoke on democratic reforms and freedoms. In addition, Merrill was also an accomplished artist. Merrill was father of five adult children. He was married to Mary K. Merrill for more than 50 years until her death in 1999; late in life, he married Julie Boudreaux. At the time of his death, he resided in Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts, on a farm in Hancock, New Hampshire, and in Nowy SƒÖcz, Poland. He died on November 29, 2017, in Nowy SƒÖcz, Poland.

In the game, players assume the role of a recently promoted flight officer from the titular squadron taking control of one of the two Feather space fighter crafts in an attempt to defend Outpost 51 by overthrowing the invading alien fleet coming from outer space bounds across multiple sectors and destroying their Sun-powered laser cannon. Conceived by Koji Tsuchida, Shadow Squadron was created in conjunction with Japanese animation design studio Artmic, who provided mecha designs by Kimitoshi Yamane. Shadow Squadron has been met with a mostly mixed reception from critics since its release, some of which praised various aspects such as the 3D flat-shaded polygon visuals, gameplay and controls but others criticized its lackluster presentation and sound design, while most reviewers felt divided in regards to other areas like the lack of additional texture-mapped graphics and replay value. Critics also compared the game with other titles in the same genre such as Star Fox, Star Raiders and Star Wars Arcade, which received a conversion for the 32X months prior. A sequel, Stellar Assault SS, was created by SIMS Co., Ltd. and released exclusively for the Sega Saturn in Japan on 26 February 1998.  Gameplay  Shadow Squadron is a semi-open 3D space combat simulation game similar to Star Fox and Star Wars Arcade where players assume the role of a recently promoted flight officer from the titular squadron taking control of either one of the two Feather space fighter crafts through six missions set across various sectors in outer space, where the main objective is to obliterate the invading alien fleet and their Sun-powered laser cannon in order to protect Outpost 51.Shadow Squadron instruction manual (Sega 32X, US) Besides a single-player campaign, the game also offers a two- player cooperative mode where one player pilots the ship, while either the AI or other human players act as the gunner. In addition, players also have access to the options menu at the title screen where various settings can be adjusted such as controls, difficulty level, sound configurations, among other settings that alters the gameplay as well as an object viewer option that allows to get a closer look at enemies. The player can control the tilt of the ship and fly in any direction. There is a target locking system that helps the player find enemies quickly, as well as shows which enemies are closer by a number at the target's side. Besides lasers, both ships also have their own type of torpedo. An energy shield, capable of protecting the ship against enemy fire and hits, can be turned on and off when needed to save energy. A circular radar display appears at the bottom of the screen, which also tilts as the ship does. A next target arrow shows the player which direction the nearest enemy is. Each of the two available fighter crafts have their own advantages and disadvantages; Feather 1 is a highly maneuverable and fast light ship equipped with automatic laser cannons, whereas the Feather 2 is a more powerful and heavier ship that relies on manual fire. If the player chooses the second fighter they will have the option of choosing auto-pilot, which allows the computer to fly and the player to concentrate on fighting. The enemy ships are built with polygons and there are two main type of enemies, fighters and carrier ships. Both types must be destroyed before the current mission is complete on some levels; on others only the carrier ships must be eliminated. Before starting each mission, a tactical display shows the player's ship and all targets that must be eliminated. If the ship is destroyed, players have the choice to keep playing with a limited number of continues but once all of them are used, the game is over. After dying or completing the game, a \\"Trace\\" option is unlocked at the title screen, acting as an entire instant replay of the previous playthrough.  Development and release  Shadow Squadron for the 32X was a collaboration effort between Sega and Artmic. Shadow Squadron was developed by Sega in conjunction with Artmic, who assisted in the mechanical design work, becoming their only involvement with video games. Its creation was helmed by designer and director Koji Tsuchida, who was previously involved with projects such as the Sharp X68000 conversion of Fantasy Zone and Star Wars: Attack on the Death Star, alongside producers Hiroshi Aso and Mamoru Shigeta. Shigeru Yoshida and Toshiyuki Kuwabara served as its programmers while composers Masaru Setsumaru and Tatsuya Kozaki led the sound department with Teruhiko Nakagawa, who did the sound effects. Japanese mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane provided the mechanical designs that would later be modeled in-game by artist Tomohiro Maki, among other people collaborating in its development. Shadow Squadron was first released in Japan on 26 April 1995 under the title Stellar Assault, then in North America on 25 May of the same year, and later in Europe on June during the same time period under its original Japanese name. Some critics have noted similarities between the game and the science fiction metaseries Gall Force after release due to its mecha designs. Early previews before launch in video game magazines showcased a different HUD compared to the final version.  Reception  The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Shadow Squadron a unanimous score of 5 out of 10, assessing it as no more than a thinly veiled upgrade of Star Wars Arcade with primitive graphics and dull gameplay. They argued that the free-roaming movement and multiplayer mode, while fun additions, do not make a fundamental difference to the gameplay. GamePro also regarded the game as a Star Wars Arcade upgrade, but give it a more mixed review. They criticized the music but praised the graphics and controls as a considerable improvement over Star Wars Arcade. Next Generation commented that the game has poor presentation, citing sound effects similar to those found on 8-bit consoles and an overly monochrome color scheme, but good gameplay and controls, particularly the ability to fly in any direction. They gave it three out of five stars. In their respective retrospective review, IGN praised the game. John Linneman of Eurogamer also gave praise to the title's 3D visuals.  Sequel  A sequel to Shadow Squadron, titled Stellar Assault SS, was developed by SIMS Co., Ltd. and only released in Japan for the Sega Saturn on 26 February 1998.

The centre can house over 100 guests. It is one of five World Centres of WAGGGS; the others being Our Chalet in Switzerland, Sangam in India, Pax Lodge in England and Kusafiri in Africa. Each centre is staffed by people from around the world, giving them an international feeling, but each also draws from the local culture. Our Caba√±a has been visited by over 70,000 Girl Guides and Girl Scouts from around the world since it opened. History The concept of a Western Hemisphere Region world centre began in 1946 at a training session in Havana, Cuba, where participants discussed the idea of having a world centre in the Western Hemisphere as a counterpart to Our Chalet in Switzerland. The idea was later formalized and proposed to WAGGGS. Six years later, in 1952, the World Committee approved the idea of a new world centre in the Western Hemisphere region and a search for a location was conducted. A warm, sunny climate as well as accessibility by land, sea and air were considered a priority and locations such as Panama, Cuba, and Arizona, United States were considered before the current site in Mexico was chosen. WAGGGS formally announced the location in 1954 at a world conference held in the Netherlands. 5 acres of land were purchased at 25000 dollars with the help of Girl Scouts of the USA through their Juliette Low World Friendship Fund. The remaining funds needed to construct the centre's buildings were raised by Clementine Tangeman, who solicited donations from corporations and benefactors as well as encouraging Girl Guides and Scouts worldwide to collect and donate the remaining money needed. Our Caba√±a was dedicated on February 22, 1956 by Lady Olave Baden- Powell and later officially opened on July 24, 1957. The first event held was a Juliette Low Seminar, at which participants wrote the Our Caba√±a song to the tune of the traditional Mexican birthday song Las Ma√±anitas. The property was later expanded in 1969 to include the Geranios and Colorines dorms and the Mixcoacalli meeting and event space. A swimming pool, campfire circle, camping areas, volleyball and tennis courts and accessibility ramps were added in later additions. Symbols and mascots Our Cabana's mascot is a lizard named Iggy. He was born in 2015. Previously, the mascot was a donkey, named Amigo. The logo resembles that of the city of Cuernavaca, but has been given meaning specific to the Girl Guiding and Scouting movement. The central part of the logo is a three branch tree representing as a whole the worldwide movement of Guiding and Scouting, comprising more than 10 million members in WAGGGS member organizations. Each tree branch represents one part of the original three fold Guide promise. The red roots underneath the tree symbolize the solid foundation and continual life of WAGGGS and its members. The blue drop emerging from the side of the tree possess two meanings, communication between Our Caba√±a and the local community and between Girl Guides and Scouts Worldwide as well as being an Aztec symbol of life used to demonstrate that life is flowing in the Girl Guiding and Scouting movement.\\"Logo meaning\\", 11 April 2017, Retrieved on 4 August 2017 Facilities and accommodations The centre is made up of two main buildings: *Xochicalli-\\"house of flowers\\"-Dining Hall *Mixcoacalli-\\"meeting house\\"-Great Hall set amidst a tropical garden.

Roughly 50 students are part of this band, performing pieces by such jazz composers as Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, and Miles Davis at bi-annual school jazz concerts (which are separate from concert band) and the Brandon Jazz Festival. Throughout the year, students are not forced to play solos, or have tests. However, they are required to fill out eight listening assignments throughout the two semesters. Enrollment in Jazz Band is worth one credit. Jazz Orchestra The River East Collegiate Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Jeff Kula, meets for rehearsal four times a week after school. Unlike the school's Jazz Band, Jazz Orchestra is an auditioned group that is strictly one to a part. The acceptance of the students really only comes down to experience. While the band takes part in numerous festivals every year, the band is best known for its participation in the Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition and Festival, which takes place each year at Lincoln Center in New York City. The band has been invited to play at the festival five times since 2003 (2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2011). Furthermore, it is the only Canadian band to ever be invited to the festival. The Jazz Orchestra has been invited many times to play before the Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra. This course is worth 1 full credit. =Choir= REC has two audition vocal jazz groups, Vocaleas and Jazzmyn. Jazzmyn is a vocal group that rehearses twice a week. Vocalese also rehearses twice a week but is an program for elite singers only. In choral, from time to time, guests artists such as Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra have worked with the choral group. Students can audition to be solo. The style of music in choir uses modern and traditional. The choral group also has winter and spring concerts, and also participates in the Winnipeg Music festival. Grade 10, 11 and 12 choir is called choral. The course is aimed at vocal technique and style for performance. Performance music includes popular and traditional styles. Students must attend all the concerts. Performances include winter and spring concerts and Winnipeg Music festival. Extracurricular choir programs There are three choral performing ensembles at River East Collegiate: Vocal Jazz (Jazzmyn), Chamber Choir, and Vocalease. All courses are run by Ms. Ens. The Vocal Jazz 20G course is worth 1 credit. This course gives gifted and talented vocalists an opportunity to sing advanced four-part music together in a vocal jazz style. Enrollment is limited to 16 students (four students per vocal part). Performances include winter and spring concerts, Choral fest Jazz, and the Brandon Jazz Festival. Students are selected in September by audition only. Vocal Jazz 30S is worth 1 credit and is a continuation of Vocal Jazz 20. Vocal Jazz 40S is worth 1 credit and is a continuation of Vocal Jazz 20G and 30S. The other two courses are Chamber Choir and Vocalease is an audition only group. These courses meet outside of classes to practice for performances. These groups give performances at school concerts as well as the Brandon Jazz Festival. =Drama program= River East is also well known for putting on great annual performances. For the 2010-2011 school year, River east put on a remake of the 1998 musical Footloose, the first musical in fifteen years. Auditions were held in October, and the three performances started 12 April 2011. Other offered programs =CIP= CIP (Career Internship Program) is a high school to work transition program. Students involved with the program are offered on- the-job experience and classroom study to help them make the post grad transition. Although students are not paid for their work with cooperating employers, each student earns credit towards their high school diploma. =Peer Tutoring Program= The Peer Tutoring Program is a service \\"run by the students, for the students\\". Students with an average of 80% or higher in a course offer their talents by signing up for this program in hopes of helping other students meet their goals. This service is available to all grades for both tutoring and being tutored. Once a tutor and a tutee are matched up they simply choose a specific time to meet and then they are all ready to go. The program is monitored by the River East Collegiate resource teacher.Peer Tutoring Program. Schools.retsd.mb.ca. Retrieved on 2013-10-05. Students who volunteer to be a tutor are awarded by the school at the end of the year. Sports River East Collegiate has many teams at both the Junior Varsity and Varsity levels. They have male and female teams in Basketball, Volleyball, Soccer, Golf, Hockey and Indoor/Outdoor Track and Field and a male-only Football team. They compete in the Kildonan Peguis Athletic Conference (KPAC). The school football team won the first annual Peguis Bowl in 2007 when they defeated their rival Miles Macdonell Collegiate Buckeyes by a score of 28-0. The school has a tradition of athletic success and hundreds of KPAC championship banners hang in the gym (some dating back to the 1960s). =Varsity Football= River East had previously been in the first division (Potter Division) until 2009 when they moved down to the second division (Vidryk Division); where they made it to a semi-finals with only their second loss and a 7 - 2 final record with the coaching staff winning the Coaching Staff of the Year in their division. They moved back up to first division the next year later; but after only winning one game that year and losing in the first round of the play-offs they moved back down to the second Division and have remained there in the 2011 & 2012 seasons. In the 2012 season the Kodiaks finished 3rd, being eliminated in the semi-finals by the Kelvin Klippers. They played a good season with a final record of 6 and 3. In 2018 the Kodiaks had another great season finishing the regular season as the first ever Bramwell Conference Champions, and carrying their success into the playoffs to beat out the Kelvin Klippers 22-14 in the finals crowning them CTV Bowl Champions. First year Head Coach Sean Oleksewycz‚Äôs team finished the season with a record of 9-1, and rings in hand. =Varsity Girls' Volleyball= River East has always had a very strong varsity girls' volleyball team\\". The season is from September till mid November. They were provincial champions 4 times in a row from 1997-2001. Every year they have played very strong against one of the strongest teams which is Lord Selkirk. This year the 2010-11 team was KPAC champions and beat Lord Selkirk in provincial finals. =Junior Varsity Girls' Basketball= River East has a very successful reputation for sports, one of them being basketball. The JV teams participate in KPAC, with the season starting in December, and ending in March. As well with these games, they participate in many tournaments. Throughout the years they have won many KPAC banners and they sometimes participate in the provincials. In the past, the JV girls' basketball team have won the KPAC conference in these years (There were many back-to-back wins): :1970-71, 1973‚Äì74, 1974‚Äì75, 1975‚Äì76, 1977‚Äì78, 1978‚Äì79, :1979-80, 1984‚Äì85, 1998‚Äì99, 1999-00, 2001‚Äì02, 2002‚Äì03, :2003-04, 2007‚Äì08, 2008‚Äì09 =Girls' hockey= The River east Kodiaks girls‚Äô hockey team runs from October till about March. They have a team of 11 players and 1 goalie. They are led by the coaching staff of Mr. Akerstream, Mr. Valiquette, Pat and Karey. Last year the Kodiak girls were placed on the B side, and were in the finals, but lost with only a few seconds left. It was a close series. This year for season 2012- 2013 the girls were placed on the B side, and so far they are succeeding with wins, and no loses. They continue to succeed throughout the year and hope to win a championship. The girls work well as a team, never individual play. On the ice the girls all have great chemistry. The new rookies on board this year are doing very well and continue to succeed along with the grade 11's and 12's. In conclusion all the players and coaches get along very well. The grade 12 girls did a very good job of making the rookies feel comfortable around the team. They showed very good leadership. =Boys' hockey= This year the River East Kodiaks boys' hockey team is made up of 15- to 18-year-old boys. The team's record is 3-7 and the team is ranked 9th in the ‚ÄòA‚Äô division. The team will be participating in several tournaments in Winnipeg and late November the team will be visiting Ontario Canada. Also this year we are pleased to be hosting the High School Provincials in our territory. The head coach for the boys' hockey team is Mr.Zajac. The team is made up of several grades - 10, 11 and also 12. This year the boys and coaches are hoping for the best and aiming to win City Champs or Provincials. =Girls' soccer= River East girls' soccer team has been very successful the last 15 years. The outdoor soccer team has won 9 out of the last 15 KPAC championships. They won in the 1995- 1996 school year, as well as 1997-1998, 2002‚Äì2003, 2003‚Äì2004, 2005‚Äì2006, 2007‚Äì2008, 2008‚Äì2009 and 2009-2010.

To make the team you to attend the open tryouts before the soccer season, they usually carry a roster anywhere from 14 -18 girls depending on numbers. Besides just outdoor soccer River East is one of the few schools in the KPAC division to field an indoor team as well. =Junior varsity football= The junior varsity (JV) league was first introduced in 2009 and was made for grade 9 and grade 10 players only. River East joined this league in 2009 and went on to win the championship that same year. The Kodiaks did not have a JV team in the 2010 league due to lack of grade 10 players and loss of coaching staff. The few grade 10 players in 2010 played with the varsity Kodiak football team. In 2011, they once again had enough enrolment to form a team and went on to win the Junior Varsity Division with a school record of 11‚Äì0 perfect season with the coaching staff winning the Coaching Staff of the Year in their division.

Description The leaf scorpionfish is about long fully grown. Their color varies from green, red, pink, brown, ocher and yellowish to a ghostly white. The fish is almost as flat as a leaf and resembles a leaf in many other ways. The head and mouth are large. Through their eyes is a dark line. The large dorsal fin starts just behind the eyes and has 12 spines and eight to 11 soft rays. The anal fin has three spines and five or six soft rays. The venom of the leaf scorpionfish is considerably weaker than that of the lionfish and stonefish. The skin often has blotches that enhance a camouflage effect. This fish has appendages around the mouth, and sometimes real algae and hydroids grow on its skin. This fish molts every 10 to 14 days, and can change colors after the molt. Behavior The leaf scorpionfish resembles a dead leaf lying in the water. To enhance this camouflage, it even makes gentle sideways movements in its pelvic area which make it resemble a drifting inert object. It is an ambush predator, waiting until suitable prey, a small fish or shrimp, approaches. Then it slowly moves with its pectoral fins close to the victim. When the leaf scorpionfish is close enough, the prey is sucked in by a sudden opening of its mouth. It eats small crustaceans, fishes, and larvae. Distribution and habitat Taenianotus triacanthus is widespread from east African coast and the Red Sea to the tropical Indo-Pacific, north to the Galapagos Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, Hawaii, and the coast of New South Wales. This species can be found in tropical waters on coral reefs, from shallow water to a depth of 130 m. { T. triacanthus in Vietnam T. triacanthus in Bunaken, Sulawesi Leaf scorpionfish in Borneo Leaf scorpionfish on a sandy bottom } References External links * leaf scorpionfish Venomous fish Marine fish of Northern Australia leaf scorpionfish Taxa named by Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de ","title":"Taenianotus triacanthus"},{"id":"9762825","title":"1990 Alpine Skiing World Cup ‚Äì Men's Giant Slalom"},{"id":"9762832","text":"Cosmic Odyssey may refer to: * Cosmic Odyssey (comics) * Cosmic Odyssey (documentary) ","title":"Cosmic Odyssey"},{"id":"9762837","text":"Venture Transport was the largest independent bus operator in North East England.

In September 1893 he became 2nd Kapellmeister at the Hamburg Stadttheater (Director and 1st Kapellmeister was Gustav Mahler); while in Hamburg he married in March 1895 soprano Katharina Klafsky. During his two seasons (each 9 months) at the Hamburg Theater he conducted a total of 343 performances of 42 different operas . The couple traveled to the United States in the summer of 1896 (breaching their contract with the Hamburg Opera) to join the Damrosch Opera Company, returning to Germany a year later. From then on, Lohse held important conductorial posts at Strasbourg (1897-1904), Riga Stadttheater (1899-1900), Cologne (1903‚Äì11), the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie (1911‚Äì12), and the Stadttheater in Leipzig (1912‚Äì23).

Produced by magma with an intermediate andesite composition, it has steep slopes and thick glassy margins. Hogg Rock exhibits normal magnetic polarity and is probably about 80,000 years old. Hogg Rock lies south of Three Fingered Jack and north of Hayrick Butte, a somewhat larger tuya of similar age and composition. A tuya is a type of subglacial volcano, formed when lava erupts underneath an overlying glacier or ice sheet and then melts through to the surface and pools, producing the flat plateau on top with near-vertical walls along the ice-contact margin as the lava cools and hardens. It is a historic landmark, with the remnants of Colonel T. Egenton Hogg's Oregon Pacific Railroad, the Santiam Lodge, and a quarry. The mountain offers snowshoe and snowmobile trails, and its summit provides views of the surrounding area including volcanoes like the Black Butte stratovolcano, Mount Washington, Sand Mountain, and Potato Hill.  Geography  Hogg Rock is located in Linn County, in the U. S. state of Oregon. It is close to Santiam Pass, by the Hayrick Butte tuya, another feature produced from the interaction of volcanic eruptive materials with glaciers. It is close to the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, near where Oregon Route 22 and US Highway 20 intersect with the Cascade Range at Santiam Pass, and sits next to Oregon Route 126. Hogg Rock lies about north of Collier Cone, a cinder cone at the northern side of the base of the North Sister. The United States Geological Survey considers Hogg Rock part of the Three Fingered Jack quadrangle, while Siebert, Simkin, and Kimberly (2010) list it as a volcanic cone of Three Fingered Jack. Hogg Rock lies south of Three Fingered Jack and north of Hoodoo Butte and Hayrick Butte. According to the Geographic Names Information System, the volcano has an elevation of .  Ecology  The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife determined in the early 1990s that there was potential for peregrine falcon nests at Hogg Rock, though it was considered low-quality habitat because of its lack of suitable ledges and high amounts of human disturbance. Wildflowers and bracken ferns occur along roadways. The area has previously been affected by fires.  Geology  Hogg Rock, Three Fingered Jack, Mount Jefferson, and U.S. 20 near Santiam Pass North Sister and Mount Washington mark isolated volcanic centers among the highly mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) platform of the central High Cascades. About 4.5 million years ago, eruption of mafic lava filled a subsiding Pliocene depression, creating the modern mafic edifice of the High Cascades. Compared to the eruptive products at and near North Sister, lava deposits at Mount Washington have a greater abundance of incompatible elements (elements unsuitable in size and/or charge to the cation sites of the minerals of which it is included.) Hogg Rock shows more similarity to the basaltic andesite deposits at North Sister, which are poorly enriched in incompatible elements. The part of the High Cascades that extends south from Mount Jefferson to Santiam Pass includes shield volcanoes, lava domes, and cinder cones. The high elevation of Matuyama-aged rocks east of Santiam Pass, coupled with exposure of Brunhes- aged rocks to the west, imply the presence of a northward-trending normal fault. Part of a mostly mafic chain of volcanoes between the Three Sisters and Mount Jefferson, Hogg Rock has magma with an intermediate composition. A tuya, Hogg Rock is also considered a small lava dome with the flat top typically observed for tuya volcanoes. Unlike most lava domes in the Cascades, which are made of dacite or rhyodacite, Hogg Rock is comprised by andesitic lava. It is thick with steep sides that have glassy margins between in thickness, and the rock forming the dome is heavily jointed. Andesite forming Hogg Rock has an aphyric, only slightly porphyritic texture, with plagioclase, orthopyroxene, and olivine phenocrysts. Along with Hayrick Butte, the silica content for Hogg Rock measures about 59‚Äì60 percent. The volcano has been eroded by glaciers. It was formed during the Pleistocene, with an approximate age of roughly 80,000 years according to Deligne et al. (2017), corresponding to the Wisconsin glacial period; Hill and Priest (1992) assign it an age of 90,000 years ¬± 20,000 years, while Sherrod et al. argue that its age by K‚ÄìAr dating is 80,000 years ¬± 20,000 years. The volcano exhibits a normal magnetic polarity. Santiam Pass has been assessed for its geothermal energy potential, and there is a drill corehole extending to a depth of south of the highway area. In addition to the expected basaltic andesite lava and a number of dikes, the core also detected unusual basalt, andesite, and coarse sediment indicative of debris flows. The dating for these samples cannot be confirmed because of the close proximity of Brunhes-aged dikes, which likely heated nearby rock and caused the loss of radiogenic argon.  Human history  Hogg Rock served as a landmark for travelers searching for Hogg Pass, which was later renamed to Santiam Pass by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1929. This name drew from the Santiam River, its name referring to the Santiam people, who were forced to leave the area and move to the Grand Ronde reservation. Hogg Rock was named after Colonel T. Egenton Hogg, the head of the Oregon Pacific Railroad that was supposed to cross the Cascades in this location. Construction on the railroad began in the 1870s, costing Hogg about 5 million. The railway was intended by Hogg to travel from Yaquina Bay to the Snake River. Also known as the Corvallis and Eastern Railroad, it was built by Chinese and Italian workers to connect Newport and Boise, though in actuality it only extended to Idanha. Hogg ran out of money, but trying to meet the government contract stipulation that he finished crossing the Cascade Range before claiming land grants, he built of isolated railtracks around Hogg Rock before getting a 14-person crew to pull a boxcar on them. He then claimed the isolated tracks around the tuya were a train railway. Hogg eventually declared bankruptcy in 1890. After other businesspeople tried to pick up the railroad, it was absorbed by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company. Today, remnants of the railroad are still present at the volcano. Santiam Pass, located at an elevation of , marks a historic feature in the Cascade Range. West of Mount Washington and Three Fingered Jack, there are three major routes. One travels north and west down the North Santiam River, the same path followed by Hogg's railroad, while another moves southwest along the McKenzie River. The third route moves west over Tombstone Pass, reaching the South Santiam River, and was followed by the Santiam Wagon Road from 1865 to 1914 as well as the auto race of the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. In addition to the railroad, there is also a quarry at Hogg Rock and the rotting Santiam Pass Ski Lodge building. Santiam Pass Ski Lodge, constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1939‚Äì1940, and operated for 46 years as a ski lodge with overnight dorms and later as a youth camp. In 1986 it was boarded up. It has survived major forest fires in 1968 and 2003, withstanding flames in the latter fire after firefighters swathed it in kevlar sheets. Early 2018 Willamette National Forest issued a Special Use Permit to Dwight and Susan Sheets, Friends of Santiam Pass Ski Lodge to restore the lodge and operate it year round as a day lodge and rental venue. Funds for restoration project are from private grants and donations. Estimated timeline for the completion of the restoration is 4-5 years.  Recreation  The Hoodoo ski area is located on nearby Hoodoo Butte. Hogg Rock can be reached from a snowshoe trail that starts at the Santiam Pass Sno-Park, which has restrooms and a snow play area for children. Entrance to the Sno-Park requires a permit. There is also a snowmobile trail that moves west from Santiam Lodge and then north at Hogg Rock, traveling along the remnants of Hogg's railroad. It eventually reaches the Hogg Rock summit by passing a trail left of a rock quarry at the mountain. The peak offers views of the Black Butte stratovolcano, Mount Washington, Hoodoo Butte, Sand Mountain, Three Fingered Jack, and Potato Hill. There is a viewpoint on the western slope of Hogg Rock shows forests on Potato Hill and Hoodoo Butte as well as the Hoodoo Ski Area.

Early years  The Youngstown Playhouse traces its origins to February 16, 1927, when several local drama organizations formed a single organization called the Youngstown Players. With the support of local civic leaders, the group eventually secured its own building. The Youngstown Playhouse was initially housed in a renovated 19th- century barn. In 1940, supporters of the Playhouse raised $30,000 to build a new facility. Instead, the money was used to renovate a vacant movie house for live theater. Two years later, the Playhouse christened its new location with a production of \\"Camille of Roaring Camp\\".  Transformation  During World War II, the Youngstown Playhouse raised its artistic standards considerably. Under the artistic direction of Broadway director Arthur Sircom, the Playhouse became known as a training ground for professional actors. Local theatrical figures who gained experience at the Youngstown Playhouse included the late dramatic screen actress Elizabeth Hartman. In 1959, the Playhouse moved to a new two-theater building on Glenwood Avenue.

Early childhood education  Early childhood education includes the Basic, Infant and privately operated pre-schools. The age cohort is usually 1 ‚Äì 6 years. The Government of Jamaica began its support for the development of early childhood education, care and development in 1942. There are 2,595 early childhood institutions. Of these, 183 are not recognized by the government, 401 are day care centers, approximately 100 are infant schools and five are special education schools which offer early childhood care. The enrollment rate between 4 and 6 years is 62% - one of the highest rates in the region.  Primary education  Walk to celebrate the 105th anniversary of St. Hugh's High School for Girls, January 2004 Primary education in Jamaica addresses the basic educational needs of students and prepares them for secondary education. It includes children between the ages of 5 and 12 years. Under the Caribbean Examination Council's Revised Primary Curriculum, student assessment has changed significantly from the former Common Entrance Examination at the end of Grade 6. Since 1999, the National Assessment Program (NAP) has been utilizing a variety of teaching strategies to ensure that learning experiences are more broad based and student centered. NAP adopts an integrated approach from grades 1-3 and a discrete subject area for grades 4-6. For many years, Jamaica has achieved universal primary education. * Grade 1: Readiness Inventory * Grade 3: Assessment tests in Math and Language Arts * Grade 4: Literacy and Numeracy Tests * Grade 6: Achievement Test (GSAT): in Math, Language Arts, Social Studies (Civic Studies, Geography and History), Science and Communication Task The six years of primary school education in Jamaica is compulsory and free. Children receive their instruction in English, and remain there between the ages of 6 and 12. Schools may be state-owned, or private preparatory schools. Many students tend to enter primary schools already being able to read, as they would have been taught to do so in basic schools (kindergartens, daycare centers etc.) Students tend to do a variety of subjects at the primary school level including religious studies, art and craft, Spanish, physical education and computer studies, though Spanish and computer studies are not the norm in most schools. When students get to Grade 4, much emphasis and focus is placed on the five subjects they will do at the end of Grade 6 (GSAT). In most primary schools, one class teacher usually teaches students all the subjects. According to a UNESCO document entitled \\"Education for all 2015 National Review Report: Jamaica\\", \\"some 96 per cent of the teachers at this level are professionally trained with female [teachers] accounting for 88 per cent of the staff complement. Most students transition from primary to secondary level education.\\" http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002300/230020E.pdf Between grades 1 and 3 students do between six and ten subjects depending on the schools. Between grades 4 and 6, most students will focus on five subjects, though after their Grade Six Achievement Exams in March each year, schools sometimes use the remaining school year to do other subjects like Art and Music. While the lecture method is used in some classes at some schools, most primary school teachers think students are too young for them to be taught by this method and instead opt to use more interactive approaches. Students are taught from early to work in groups and teachers encourage students to commit a memorise much information. It is very common for primary school students in Jamaica to be required to recite on a daily basis, various poems, tables of multiplication (generally up to 12), tables of synonyms and even mnemonics. Visual aids are used a lot to help in the teaching and learning process and it is very common to see the walls of primary school classrooms decorated with charts made by teachers or those bought in stores, that contain information that students need to know. The primary school system in Jamaica is quite rigorous as students are assigned much homework daily from as early as Grade 1 (age 5 or 6). Most students have at least two hours of homework to do each day and up to eight hours of homework on weekends. It is not uncommon for students to be punished by their teachers when homework assignments are not completed. In many instances the parents are called when the assignments are not done. Students are tested regularly and generally ranked in their classes by the grades that they receive. Students are required to do three national exams in primary schools so much pressure is placed on parents, the students, the teachers and the schools. Grade 4 Literacy and Numeracy Tests All students aged 9 or 10 are required to sit the national Grade 4 Literacy and Numeracy tests between June and July each year. To prepare for these tests, students are usually given many assignments to complete and some schools are famous for giving students numerous mock examinations to get them adequately prepared. The aim of the examination is to test students' levels (Mastery, Almost- Mastery, Non-Mastery) and abilities in these two subject areas. When students do not perform satisfactorily on these exams, they are usually required to repeat the grade and as such cannot go on to the next grade. After students sit the exams, they usually get their results. The Minister of Education usually holds a press conference to talk about the test results and discuss strategies for the following year. The schools with a high percent of students mastering these exams are usually ranked as 'Sought After Primary Schools'. The Ministry of Education also publishes the results of these schools.http://www.moe.gov.jm/grade-four-numeracy-test-results-school. Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT) In the first term of their Grade 6 year, students make a prioritized list of five high schools they wish to attend, and based on the results from the GSAT, they are placed at a school from their list. Some schools have a higher cutoff score, generally schools with a history of high academic performance. To get into the top ranked high schools in Jamaica, students need to generally score As (over 80%) in their GSAT examinations. Almost all parents want their children to go these schools. As a result, much pressure is placed on the students to excel. They must do many hours of extra lessons each day after school. Some extra classes last up to five hours a day. Most students also have to go to classes on weekends. Many children in Grade 6 across the country do have little free time as they usually have many assignments to complete for their regular school classes as well as for the extra classes. Many parents spend thousands of dollars to get students enrolled in highly competitive extra classes with teachers who are known for getting students to excel and being placed at the top traditional high schools. It is not uncommon for many students to be stressed at this point of their academic lives, as the number of assignments they receive is often overwhelming. Students tend to have great support at school from their teachers, as some schools tend to have some of their best teachers with years of experience preparing students for these exams. At most schools students are usually given mock exams to test their readiness. Teachers tend to use past GSAT papers to test the students. Usually reports are given to the parents after these exams with teacher-parent consultations on how to get the students to improve if that is the case. GSAT takes place in March each year. Students are given five exams over a two-day period (two exams on one day and three exams on the other). Students are tested on: * Social Studies (including Civics, Geography and History) * Language Arts * Mathematics * Science * Communication Tasks Social Studies, Language Arts, Mathematics and Science usually take the form of multiple choice whereas Communication Tasks usually requires students to write stories, letters, fill out forms, or make recommendations. The GSAT examination is a national examination that is administered by the Ministry of Education (MOE). Students cannot move on to public high schools without having sat these exams. The MOE prepares these exams, sends trained persons into the schools to administer these exams and is in charge of marking the exams. School teachers do not get to see the exam until after the exam is completed, and do not get to mark their students' scripts. To ensure transparency, efficiency and fairness, the government uses computers to mark the multiple choice scripts and specially trained individuals from University (lecturers), high schools (teachers) and so on to mark the communication task exams. After the examinations are marked, the grades are registered in computers. Based on students' scores, the high schools they selected and where they reside, the computer places them. Each June, primary schools get the results of the examinations. The public is generally made aware of the release date of the exams and many parents would visit the schools to collect the results of the students. The paper with the results usually has the scores the students get for each subject, their overall average and the high school at which they have been placed. Usually the media descends on some schools to capture the reaction of the students as their results are being read by the teachers. The Minister of Education holds a press conference to discuss the results of the examinations, and often explains what subjects have recorded a better performance than the previous year and which ones have declined. A comparison is often made between the performance of boys and girls and the top performing students highlighted. Congratulatory notes and messages from schools and parents are usually placed in the local newspaper to identify individual students who have done well.http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20170830/run-your-own- race-former-gsat-top-boy-tells-incoming-first-formers. Issues with the GSAT When the GSAT came into effect in 1999, many people praised if for its inclusiveness. It ushered a new era in primary and secondary education in Jamaica. Unlike the previous Common Entrance Examination,Common Entrance Examination the GSAT places almost all primary school students who sit the exams into a secondary institution or a junior high school. No sooner had the students started to prepare for the exams than it started to receive criticisms and these criticisms have increased over the years. The main criticism of the exams is that the students are required to know much information and often, information that some believe they should be learning at the high school level. The exams have gained fame for being rigorous and requiring students to know an overwhelming wealth of information. Also, students are stressed to prepare for these exams and that it is difficult to determine students' true abilities on these one-shot exams because many suffer from anxiety over these exams. Some also say it is unfair to prepare students for the exams for two to three years and because they do not necessarily do well (for whatever reason such as illness or family issues), they cannot be placed at a school of choice. Therefore, these people have called for a more continuous assessment method to be used to determine students' success on these exams. Some critics have also argued that in many instances, students who get good grades (usually considered averages of 80% and over) are not placed at traditional high schools that they selected. In addition, many education specialists in the country have also said that many students suffer from emotional and physical exhaustion so much so that when they get into a high school they fail to maintain the grades they received in the GSAT exams. Some argue that many of these 12-year-old students simply want a break from the high demands of the education system in Jamaica. Another criticism of the exam is that it places top students at particular \\"Jamaican Ivy League\\" high schools,Jamaican Ivy League high schools and students who do not do well go to other high schools. Many have argued for a balance of students to be placed at all schools so as to remove the negative stigmas attached to certain schools. In 2018, the Primary Exit Profile (PEP) replaced both the Grade 4 Literacy and Numeracy Test and the Grade Six Achievement Test.  Secondary education  11th grade Ascot High School students with their teacher, Gamberdolan, 2010 *Lower School - Forms 1-3 (Generally ages 13 - 15) or grades 7-9 :Students are exposed to a wide range of subjects, including Spanish and French as 2nd languages. Generally, Integrated Science is generally taught until the 3rd form, where students begin taking Physics, Biology and Chemistry as separate subjects. Some schools group students based on their academic achievement in the year prior. This can impact what subjects some students might be able to take later on in school, and what teachers they might be assigned to. *Upper School - Forms 4 & 5 or grades 10-11 :In 4th form, students choose anywhere from 6-11 subjects (8 is the standard) that they will sit in the Caribbean Examination Council's (CXC) school leaving examinations (Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate). These exams are similar to the GCSE exams in the UK. Students are free to create their own curricula which must include but cannot be limited to: Mathematics and English Language. All others are optional, though some schools tend to make at least 1 other compulsory. Most students take at least one foreign language. The Council now offers 33 subjects including but not limited to: History, Geography, English Literature, Agricultural Science, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Additional Mathematics, Spanish, French, Principles of Accounts, Principles of Business, Information Technology, Religious Education, Technical Drawing, Music, Visual Arts and Theater Arts. Generally, students are informally classified, or classify themselves as Arts, Sciences, Industrial Arts and Business students, especially if they plan on going to 6th form. :Grading: Some exams can be taken at either the Technical (5) or General Proficiency (28) levels. Exams are graded from Grades I to VI (up to VII, if CAPE - see below). For CSEC, I represents an outstanding performance; II is a good standard of performance; III is a fairly good standard of performance. IV and below are generally considered as failure as only Grades I through III are recognized as a pass for matriculation into tertiary institutions or entry into the work force. *Sixth Form - divided into upper and lower sixth, or grades 12 (lower) and 13 (upper) :Sixth form is an optional, two years long, advanced post secondary program, at the end of which students write the CAPE (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Exams). These are the equivalent of the GCE A-Level examinations which were the standard up until 2003. Some students still choose to sit A-levels if they wish, but in doing so they must still meet CAPE's basic subject requirements/groupings. CAPE and A-level exams are significantly harder than exams sat at the end of high school, and are often thought to be harder than most exams students will ever sit in university.  Tertiary education  Generally, A-Levels or CAPE examinations are required to enter the nation's universities. One may also qualify after having earned a 3-year diploma from an accredited post-secondary college. The word college usually denotes institutions which do not grant at least a bachelor's degree. Universities are typically the only degree granting institutions; however, many colleges have been creating joint programs with universities, and thus are able to offer some students more than a college diploma. A few universities in the United States have extension programs in various parts of Jamaica. Most of the students who enroll in these part-time programs are working professionals who want to continue their education without having to relocate closer to the nation's universities. \\\\ Tertiary education is offered by the following institutions: * Caribbean Maritime University (CMU) * University of the West Indies at Mona (a regional institution) * University of Technology (U-Tech) * Excelsior Community College (EXED) * Northern Caribbean University (NCU) * International University of the Caribbean (IUC) * University of the Commonwealth Caribbean (UCC) * Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts (an artistic conservatory) * College of Agriculture, Science and Education (CASE) * G.

Kingston, Jamaica: Ian Randle, 2005. p. 124 This program, introduced for the 1999/2000 academic year, works in accordance with the set curriculum, which includes \\"Mathematics, Social Studies, Resource and Technology which will carry tourism related materials and concepts\\". The tourism education program has also lead the Ministry of Education to edit some of the textbooks to be used in schools, with other texts being developed. With the preparation of the new textbooks comes the training of tourism teachers, with an understanding of \\"Who is a Tourist, Why People Travel, the Importance of Tourism, Anti Harassment and Culture\\". Jamaica has also formed a summer school program, which is a five-day workshop for students to gain first hand experience working in the tourism environment. Field trips to \\"local\\" tourist attractions are also included, along with a \\"one month placement of the top students in hotels and tourism related organizations. Each of the schools selected to participate in this program was invited to send five students from the third and fourth form years\\". The group of students selected is accompanied by a teacher and covers the following material: Tourism is our Business; Attitudinal Development; In the Tourist‚Äôs shoes; Tourism and the Environment; and Trends in the Industry. =Special events= Schools compete scholastically in School's Challenge Quiz and debating competitions. In regard to sports, the main track and field event is the Boys and Girls School's Championships. For football there are the Manning Cup and DaCosta Cup competitions. For cricket there is the Grace Shield competition. Many swim meets are held throughout the year.

This secretion contains pardaxin, a lipophillic peptide that causes severe plasma membrane disruption resulting in cell leakage. The pardaxin containing secretion is used as a defensive mechanism against predators including sharks. Pardaxin is irritating to predator fish, particularly affecting the sensitive gills. Dr. Eugenie Clark conducted much of the early work on Pardachirus marmoratus. The adult finless soles are bilaterally symmetrical and as they mature their left eye migrates on to the right side of the head. The highly compressed body is convex on the eyed side and flat on the blind side. The rounded caudal fin is not attached to either the dorsal or cloacal fin. It is variable in colour frequently whitish, pale brown to pale grey with a scattering of irregular dark brown ring shape markings and many dark brown spots on the head, body, and fins. long the lateral line, there are normally two brown dots containing yellow flecks. There is much biotechnological interest in pardaxin, early interest focused on potential shark repellent applications while newer research focuses on antimicrobial and neurotoxic potential of pardaxin and its analogues. One toxin produced, pardaxin-1, does have unusual shark repellent and surfactant properties it created voltage- dependent, ion-permeable channels in membranes and at high concentration it causes lysis in cell membranes. This toxin has been demonstrated to be 5-10 times more toxic, cytolytic and active in the formation of pores in cell membranes than the other toxin exuded, pardaxin-2. This species is found in shallow, coastal waters where the seabed consists of sand or mud, often near coral reefs, and they feed mainly on benthic invertebrates. It is caught for consumption, despite the poison it exudes and is marketed fresh. They often spend the day buried in the sand with only its eyes and nostrils visible. It is found in the western Indian Ocean from the Red Sea to Sri Lanka and along the east coast of Africa to Durban.

It was Greene's first trip outside of Europe. He hoped to leave civilization and find the \\"heart of darkness\\" in Africa. The interior of Liberia was at the time unmapped (an American government map had the interior as a large white space marked \\"cannibals\\"), and so he relied on local guides and porters. Greene set off from the northernmost point of the country bordering Sierra Leone near the town of Kailahun (near Pendembu) and travelled in a south- easterly direction through the jungle highlands. He crossed through a section of French Guinea, going between the Liberian towns of Zorzor and Ganta, before turning south-west and arriving at the coast at Grand Bassa. He then traveled by sea to Monrovia. Greene's account provides many insights into what Liberia was like in 1935. The country has not modernised much since, in particular away from the coast, so much of it remains unchanged to this day. Greene did encounter a number of white people along the way including American and English missionaries, a German adventurer, gold seekers and beachcombers. Most of the villages he passed through had encountered whites before, but it had been years, and so for many of the younger people it was a new experience. Greene documents the deplorable public health; there were only a handful of doctors in the whole country. A long list of diseases visibly ravaged the typical Liberian (venereal disease and malaria in particular were almost universal, with various weeping sores and wounds from insects and occasionally leprosy). Greene drank whisky during the entire trip, going through cases of it. He became ill halfway through the journey, during their stay at Zigiter, and almost died while in Zigi's Town, near the end of the trip. During this experience he discovered that he had a \\"passionate interest in living\\" which \\"seemed that night an important discovery\\".Graham Greene (1936) Journey Without Maps (1957 Ed. P.216) The trip also shaped his future writing career. Greene travelled with his cousin, Barbara Greene, who in 1938 produced her own memoir of the trip, Land Benighted (republished in 1981 as Too Late to Turn BackBarbara Greene. Too Late to Turn Back. (1991 re-print PB).). How well the two accounts match up appears to be a matter of opinion. In Paul Theroux's introduction to the 1981 version of Barbara's book, he says \\"Few journeys have been so well recorded, and there are few discrepancies and no contradictions between the two accounts\\". However, in Michael Shapiro's 2004 book A Sense of Place: Great Travel Writers Talk about Their Craft, Lives, and Inspiration, he records Jonathan Raban saying Barbara's memoir \\"contradicts Greene's memoir on almost every point.. neither narrator agrees with the one other as to anything at all, where they were, who they saw, what they met, the condition of his illness, whatever. There is just no consonance between these two accounts\\".Michael Shapiro (2004). A Sense of Place: Great Travel Writers Talk about Their Craft, Lives, and Inspiration. (page 55). In 2009 the journey was retraced by the English writer and journalist Tim Butcher, former Africa correspondent for the Daily Telegraph and author of the bestselling book on the Democratic Republic of Congo, Blood River: A Journey to Africa's Broken Heart (2007). He was accompanied by fellow Englishman and Graham Greene aficionado David Poraj-Wilczynski. Butcher's account of their adventure was published as Chasing the Devil in 2010 by Random House.

In Puranic literature of a much later period the group of four VinƒÅyakas was merged into one definite god named VinƒÅyaka whom Rudra appointed as the \\"Leader of the Ganas\\" (Ganapati). This VinƒÅyaka-Ganapati is associated with another god called Dantin, \\"the one with the tusk,\\" who is said to possess a twisted trunk () and who holds a corn-sheaf, a sugar cane, and a club.Taittiriya Aranyaka, X, 1, 5. This description of Dantin is so characteristic of the Puranic Ganapati that Heras says \\"we cannot resist to accept his full identification with this Vedic Dantin.\\" The name VinƒÅyaka is a common name for Ganesha both in the and in Buddhist Tantras. In the Smrti of YƒÅj√±avalkya, written in the 6th century, VinƒÅyaka is definitely mentioned as a demon who had been exalted to the rank of a deva.Bhandarkar, op. cit., p. 148; citation by . He is clearly described as elephant-headed by the 8th century.  The MƒÅnava-G·πõhyas≈´tra  The VinƒÅyakas in their original demonic role are mentioned only in a limited number of Brahmanical texts that are essentially within only one school of the Vedas, the K·πõ·π£·πáa Yajur Veda. The VinƒÅyakas are first mentioned in the MƒÅnava-G·πõhyas≈´tras where they appear as four demonic creatures. Dating for the MƒÅnava-G·πõhyas≈´tra is only tentative, but P. V. Kane assigns it to a period prior to 600-300 BCE and considers that they had attained a position of authority in the 2nd century BCE. S. Bhattachrji dates them between 600-200 BCE. Macdonell dates them between 500-200 BCE.. Chapter III of Thapan's book on the development of Ganesha is based on the MƒÅnava- G·πõhyas≈´tra. Citations to P. V. Kane, Sukumari Bhattacharji, and Arthur A. Macdonell are given in Thapan. Thapan concludes that the period reflected in the VinƒÅyaka section of the MƒÅnava-G·πõhyas≈´tra must have been between the end of the 3rd and early 2nd century BCE. She based this conclusion in part on the fact that in the MƒÅnava-G·πõhyas≈´tra the VinƒÅyakas are associated with various other beings, including three of the four Buddhist lokpƒÅlas (guardians of the quarters), as well as the deities MahƒÅdeva and MahƒÅsena. MahƒÅdeva and MahƒÅsena were popular gods during the A≈õokan period, a time when the spread of Buddhism must have posed a challenge to adherents of the Vedic tradition. Thapan says that this association implies that \\"not only was Buddhism viewed inimically by the brƒÅma≈Üa authors of this text..., but so were MahƒÅdeva and MahƒÅsena.\\"  The MahƒÅbhƒÅrata  The VinƒÅyakas are also mentioned in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata where their role shows a distinct change in two different age strata of that epic. *In the ≈öƒÅnti Parva they are depicted as evil beings and are mentioned along with bh≈´tas and pi≈õƒÅcas. These passages may date shortly after the composition of the '. *In the Anu≈õƒÅsana Parva they lose their evil characterization and are worshipped as the , part of the contingent. These passages are certainly dated as belonging to the first one or two centuries CE. A passage in the SabhƒÅ Parva which mentions a being named Danti belongs to the same period. Danti appears to be synonymous with the MahƒÅkƒÅya (One having a huge body) who is named along with the as part of ≈öiva's entourage in the Anu≈õƒÅsana Parva. Thapan notes that almost all of the references to the VinƒÅyakas, Danti, and their related beings do not appear in the main body of the critical edition of the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, but are only mentioned in the Appendices. This means that the traditions associated with these figures were limited to only a few versions which must have been found in only specific regions.

The company was organized by Walter Damrosch, and was meant to present German opera; in this capacity it did much to advance the cause of Richard Wagner's music in the United States. Damrosch created the company to combat what he perceived to be the growing apathy, post-1890, of the general opera-going public to German opera. More specifically, his complaints were aimed against the management of the Metropolitan Opera. The immediate impetus of the company's founding came when, in 1894, Damrosch presented concert performances of G√∂tterd√§mmerung and Die Walk√ºre. Damrosch raised money for the company by selling his house in New York City, and he spent the summer of 1894 travelling Europe to recruit singers. Among those with whom he signed contracts were Johanna Gadski and Rosa Sucher, both of whom made their American debuts with the company; others included Max Alvary and Emil Fischer. The company opened its eight-week season in New York with a performance of Tristan und Isolde at the Metropolitan Opera, on February 25, 1895. Following this was an extensive tour; the season netted a profit of $53,000. The company remained in business for five more years. The second season saw the addition of Milka Ternina and David Bispham to its rosters; Katharina Klafsky and her husband Otto Lohse also joined the company, but returned to Europe after the season's end. 1896 saw the premiere of Damrosch's own opera after The Scarlet Letter. With the following season came a change of name and focus for the company; becoming the Damrosch-Ellis Company, it expanded its horizons to include both Italian and French opera in addition to German. Nellie Melba and Emma Calv√© both joined the company at this time. But deficits had begun to accumulate after the second season, and mounted rapidly; these forced the company to close for good in 1900.

Currently in the Gaza Strip, all film projects must be approved by Hamas' Culture Ministry before they can be screened in public. Independent filmmakers have claimed that the Culture Ministry cracks down on content not conforming to Hamas edicts. In a notable 2010 case, Hamas banned the short film Something Sweet, directed by Khalil al- Muzzayen, which was submitted at the Cannes Film Festival. Hamas banned it from being shown locally due to a four-second scene where a woman is shown with her hair uncovered. In 2011, a film festival hosted by the Gaza Women's Affairs Center which included documentaries and fictional pieces on women's issues, but the Culture Ministry censored numerous scenes. One film had to remove a scene where a woman lowered one shoulder of her dress, and another had to remove a scene of a man swearing.

More than half of the state park is a tallgrass prairie maintained as a natural area of Illinois. It is located in Grundy County near the town of Morris, approximately southwest of Chicago. Ecosystem The Goose Lake region formed in the post-Wisconsin glaciation period as a flat, wet area dominated by layers of sand and silt laid down by postglacial outwash. The Des Plaines River and Kankakee River converge near here to form the Illinois River. Until heavily exploited for its natural resources during the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Goose Lake area was a stable wetland, with swathes of prairie grass surrounding the shallow Goose Lake. The region is in the Central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion. The Goose Lake area has historically been a favorite place for hunting, fishing, and gathering, with geese, ducks, and other waterfowl; a wide variety of fish and shellfish; and wet-footed game such as beaver and muskrat. History While the flat, alluvial soil of this riparian bottomland was intensely fertile, the lack of adequate drainage made the land of the Goose Lake country unsuitable for subdivision for agriculture. A different fate awaited much of it. The poorly drained sediment under and adjacent to Goose Lake was rich in clay. Starting as early as the 1820s, the sticky clay was extensively dug by settlers. Some of them were trained potters; they fired the clay in kilns to create pieces of earthenware for frontier farm and household needs. The potters' settlement was called Jugtown, and the road to the park's visitor center is called Jugtown Road to this day. A few pieces of Jugtown earthenware have been saved by collectors, and some of the larger claypits can be seen today. Frontiersmen also dug ditches through the clay to partly drain the wet prairie for pastureland. Soil too damp for crops could be used for cattle. Local drainage activity peaked in 1890, when local farmers formed a drainage district and cooperated to drain Goose Lake. The area's defining geographical feature disappeared and was replaced by damp farmland and wet pastureland. The drainage was a partial failure; if it had been a success, the remaining patches of prairie would have disappeared under the plow. Today, the park's Marsh Loop Trail passes over part of the bed of the vanished lake. Underneath the clay were thin veins of coal, dug from the beginning by the farmers and potters for local use. In the second half of the 1800s, regional coal mining increased to supply fuel to the growing city of Chicago. The main line of the Santa Fe Railroad was built adjacent to the prairie land, and the mines built spur tracks into the coal field to haul the coal to customers. Industrial strip mining, with motorized shovels, began in 1928. The miners left piles of tailings in the southern section of the remaining prairie, further altering the landscape. The area was further altered after World War II with the construction of two great electrical generating plants, the coal-burning Collins Station and the nuclear-powered Dresden Nuclear Power Plant (1960). The Collins plant was constructed in conjunction with an adjacent artificial pond, Heidecke Lake, dug to serve as a cooling pond for the generating plant. Heidecke Lake today serves as much of the northern boundary of Goose Lake Prairie. Ironically, the hand of man had destroyed one lake in the Illinois River bottomland, Goose Lake, and then created another, Heidecke Lake. Today The first of Goose Lake was purchased by Illinois for nature preservation purposes in 1969. The addition of additional parcels created the present-day Goose Lake Prairie State Natural Area. The remaining patches of tallgrass prairie had been extensively altered by human activity during the preceding 150 years, but active management began to re-knit these patches into a unified swathe of natural grassland. In 1998, two sites in the park were added to the National Register of Historic Places, White and Company's Goose Lake Stoneware Manufactury and White and Company's Goose Lake Tile Works. Unlike many of Illinois's state parks, Goose Lake Prairie is not primarily managed for hunting; visitors are encouraged to enjoy a tallgrass prairie ecosystem, dominated by grasses such as big bluestem, Indian grass, and switchgrass, and by flowering forbs such as compass plants, coneflowers, goldenrod, shooting stars, and violets. The state park's workers and managers maintain a seven-mile network of trails throughout the park. Some of the park's patches of mature grassland sprout blades up to eight feet in height. The patches of old-growth tallgrass prairie that have survived to the present day serve as a biotic refuge for many species that can live nowhere else, especially prairie-endemic moths and butterflies. Some rare prairie plants are especially adapted to feed and be fertilized by equally rare prairie insects. Lepidopterists have found the papaipema moth, previously thought to be extinct, fluttering about Goose Lake Prairie's forbs and flowers. The Cragg Cabin, a c. 1838 log cabin originally built in nearby Mazon, Illinois, has been relocated to Goose Lake Prairie as a tribute to the frontier heritage of the Prairie State. Together with the nearby Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Goose Lake Prairie is a reminder of the tens of thousands of acres of tallgrass prairie that once lived in Illinois. Goose Lake Prairie has been listed as an Important Bird Area of Illinois. Goose Lake Prairie State Natural Area is accessible from Exit 240 on Interstate 55.

It is never possible to prove that all organisms have been destroyed, as the likelihood of survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. So SAL is used to express the probability of the survival. For example, medical device manufacturers design their sterilization processes for an extremely low SAL, such as 10‚àí6, which is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of a non- sterile unit. SAL also describes the killing efficacy of a sterilization process. A very effective sterilization process has a very low SAL.  Terminology  Mathematically, SALs are probabilities, often very small but (by definition) always lying between zero and one. So when they are expressed in scientific notation their exponents are negative, as for instance, \\"The SAL of this process is 10‚àí6\\". But the term SAL is sometimes also used to refer to a sterilization's efficacy. This usage (technically the multiplicative inverse) results in positive exponents, as in \\"The SAL of this process is 106\\". To avoid ambiguity from these inverse usages, some authors use the term log reduction (e.g., \\"This process gives a six-log reduction\\"). SALs can also be used to describe the microbial population that was destroyed by the sterilization process, though this is not the same as the probabilistic definition. What is often called a \\"log reduction\\" (technically a reduction by one order of magnitude) represents a 90% reduction in microbial population. Thus a process that achieves a \\"6-log reduction\\" (10‚àí6) will theoretically reduce an initial population of one million organisms to very close to zero. The difference in meaning between this and the probabilistic sense can be seen from an example: if careful assays before and after indicate that a procedure has inactivated 90% of the biological agents in some unit, then the procedure can be correctly reported to have achieved a 1-log reduction, even though the probability that the unit is sterile is not 90% but 0. Because of all these ambiguities, contexts in which it is critical to prevent any confusion‚Äîsuch as in the setting of standards‚Äîrequire that SAL terminology be defined carefully and explicitly. SALs describing the \\"Probability of a Non-Sterile Unit\\" are expressed more specifically in some literature.The following simplified summary may be used to explain these concepts in F0 an easily understood manner References Microbiology terms Sterilization (microbiology) ","title":"Sterility assurance level"},{"id":"9763325","text":"Fran√ßois Coulon de Villiers (1712 - 22 May 1794) was a French military officer from an influential military family in the French and Indian War and then an influential officer in the New Spain community of New Orleans.  Overview  He was born in Verch√®res, Quebec, the son of Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers and Angelique Jarret de Verch√®res. In 1744, he was the first commandant of Fort de Cavagnal on the bluffs above the Missouri River, in what was then known as the Illinois country of upper Louisiana, near modern-day Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It was the furthest west of the French forts in Louisiana (New France). A member of a military family, his brother Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was slaughtered while in custody of George Washington in what has been called the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754. The incident ignited the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War. Another of his brothers, Louis Coulon de Villiers, defeated Washington in the next battle of the campaign in the Battle of the Great Meadows. It marked the only time Washington had to sue for peace in battle. Villiers served in many of battles of the war, including the Battle of Fort Duquesne. He was captured in the Battle of Fort Niagara, and had to be exchanged. After its ultimate defeat in the war, France ceded Louisiana to Spain in the Treaty of Paris (1763). From that time on, Villiers served in various capacities for New Spain, including commandant at Fort St. Jean-Baptiste at Natchitoches in lower Louisiana, and Alcalde for New Orleans, Louisiana.

How old is the universe? How much matter and energy does the universe contain? 21st century Cosmos probes questions of cosmology with international astronomers to refine our understanding of how stars and galaxies are formed, if the universe is flat or curved, and how and why the universe will continue to expand. * \\"The Case for Mars\\" ‚Äì With its sandy deserts, snow-white polar caps and mysterious surface markings, Mars resembles our own world more than any other planet. For over 100 years, experts have debated whether or not there's life on Mars. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission produced an accurate map of the planet and detected evidence of an ancient ocean. How can a planet lose an entire ocean? Scientists are working to find out if remnants of this ocean are circulating beneath Mars' surface. The Case for Mars explores Mars' landscape and compares it to oceans on Earth, while asking the question: Where will Mars exploration go next? * \\"The Enigma of Venus\\" ‚Äì Venus, the Sun's second planet, is a dark, broiling oven. It is a high-pressure, volcanic world with temperatures soaring above 500 degrees Celsius and air choked with carbon dioxide. How can the planets Earth and Venus, so similar in size and composition, be so different? The Enigma of Venus explores this unique planet's features, including its abundant volcanoes, which have been mysteriously inactive for hundreds of millions of years. Planetary scientists theorize on the current state of Venus, and speculate about what it can teach us regarding global warming on our own planet. * \\"Extreme Astronomy\\" ‚Äì At the edge of the spectral frontier, strange things go bang! in the night.

The building was demolished in 2013. History Richard Neutra was awarded the design, and began work in 1958. Design requirements included a central park administration office, and space for the cyclorama painting previously held remotely at Baltimore Road. Orndorff Construction Company, Inc., won the construction contract with a bid of $687,349, in 1959. The site at Ziegler's Grove was intended to tie the painting closely to the battle location it depicted. However, by the end of the 20th-century attitudes towards battlefield presentation had changed, and the National Park Service sought to remove many modern structures from key sites. In 1998, the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places noted that the building possessed \\"exceptional historic and architectural significance.\\"\\"Cyclorama Richard Neutra's 1961 Lincoln Memorial at Gettysburg.\\" reCyclorama June 7, 2007.

In 2005, the Gettysburg Cyclorama was removed for restoration (reopened in the Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center in 2007), and the Cyclorama Building was closed to the public. After the building was not added to the National Register of Historic Places, in 2010, a U.S. District court judge ruled for the Recent Past Preservation Network (Plaintiff) that the NPS \\"had failed to comply with federal law requiring it to analyze the effect of the Cyclorama Center demolition and come up with alternatives to destroying it.\\" The Neutra Cyclorama in 2011 In August 2012, the court-ordered NPS study concluded that \\"the best course of action would be to demolish the Cyclorama Building that has stood in the park for 50 years.\\" In January 2013, the Park Service announced plans to demolish the building during the winter of 2013.

He was elected on September 10, 1982, when Viet Tan was founded. He was considered, among the expatriate Vietnamese, the leader of the anti-communist resistance against the Vietnamese government. Biography Ho√†ng C∆° Minh was born at V·∫Ω Alley, ƒê√¥ng Ng·∫°c Village, T·ª´ Li√™m District, H√† ƒê√¥ng Province (now T·ª´ Li√™m the North District of Hanoi) in 1935. His father was the Provincial Education Commissioner of H√† ƒê√¥ng and Hanoi in the long times. He graduated in mathematics from the University of Hanoi (Universit√© Indochinoise) in 1954. In 1954, he was among the tide of northerners who went south to avoid communism. The following year, he joined the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) where he was a decorated officer. He was known as an incorruptible leader and was the youngest Rear Admiral in the Republic of Vietnam Navy. He was known as an incorruptible leader and rose quickly in the Republic of Vietnam Navy, where he became commodore-admiral. After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Ho√†ng C∆° Minh established the foundations for a long-term democracy movement against the Vietnamese communist regime. In 1982 he founded Vietnam Reform Revolutionary Party (Viettan) along the Thai-Lao border and was elected as first chairman. In Thai base, Viettan ordered soldiers to call him as Master Ho√†ng-c∆°-MinhMaster (√îng th·∫ßy / Mister Master) was the nickname which ARVN soldiers called their officers. (Th·∫ßy Ho√†ng-c∆°-Minh) for the opposition of Uncle H·ªì-ch√≠-MinhA Son's Journey for Justice - Terror in Little Saigon 1 2. He died at the Laotian forest in August 1987 while attempting to enter VietnamË∂äÊñ∞‚ÄîÂü∑Ëø∑‰∏çÊÇüÂú∞Ë°åÈ®ô. =Military career= Hoang Co Minh graduated from the South Vietnamese Naval Academy at Nha Trang and studied at the U.S. Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, California. He quickly rose as a commander in the South Vietnamese riverine forces. From 1964-65, he served as defense attache in the Republic of Vietnam's embassy in Seoul, where he was instrumental in securing the diplomatic and military support of South Korea. Following his return to Vietnam, he held a series of naval commands. He was widely respected for his battlefield success and incorruptibility. In 1974, he was promoted to rear admiral, becoming one of the youngest flag officers in the ARVN. As North Vietnamese forces entered Saigon on April 30, 1975, Ho√†ng C∆° Minh's final act as a military officer was to lead a South Vietnamese naval flotilla out to sea to escort the first wave of ‚Äòboat people‚Äô to freedom and to prevent the warships from falling into communist hands. =From political refugee to movement leader= Hoang Co Minh and his family resettled in the Washington D.C. area. Like most Vietnamese refugees in 1975, he was sponsored by an American family. Hoang Co Minh‚Äôs family was taken in by James Kelly, a Vietnam veteran and later senior national security official in the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations. For the next several years, Hoang Co Minh worked as a house painter during the day and focused his energies on organizing among the diaspora. He cofounded several political organizations aiming to promote freedom in Vietnam. From this network of overseas Vietnamese, a political movement took shape. It coalesced into Viet Tan with the mission of undertaking a revolutionary struggle to end dictatorship and reform the country. Hoang Co Minh advocated a self-reliant struggle based on the power of the Vietnamese people with the ultimate goal of rebuilding and modernizing the country. This ran contrary to much of the sentiment in the diaspora then which believed that outside support was absolutely essential for changing Vietnam and narrowly defined the struggle as overthrowing communism. The name of Viet Tan is based on the fusion of \\"Viet Nam\\" and \\"Canh Tan\\", which means comprehensive reform. In 1981, Ho√†ng C∆° Minh met with Thai government officials and received their agreement to open offices along the Thai-Lao border. From these operating bases, Vietnamese from the diaspora linked up with compatriots inside the country to build a pro-democracy movement on the ground. At Viet Tan‚Äôs founding political conference in September 1982, Ho√†ng C∆° Minh was elected chairman. He spent most of his time in the malaria-infested jungle where he could be close to Vietnam and lead the movement. The period of the 1980s was a challenging time for Vietnamese activists. The country was sealed off from the world and Vietnamese communist troops occupied both Laos and Cambodia. To travel to and from Vietnam, people would have to travel through the killing fields of Indochina. It was in that environment that Viettan members from the diaspora tried to link up with activists on the ground. In summer 1987, Ho√†ng C∆° Minh led a group of 200 activists from Thailand to Vietnam. They were ambushed by communist troops along the way. Hoang Co Minh died on August 28, 1987, less than 20 kilometers from Vietnam. Inspired by the vision of Ho√†ng C∆° Minh and his sacrifice for the movement, Viet Tan continues to this day as the leading Vietnamese pro- democracy opposition party.

He was an instructor of physiology at the University of Michigan (1906‚Äì11), and assistant professor at Cornell University Medical School (1911‚Äì18). From 1918-53, he was professor and chairman of the Dept. of Physiology at Western Reserve University Medical School that became known as Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Wiggers achieved world recognition for developing a new method of registering heart and blood pressure, finding the effects of low oxygen pressure on circulation, discovering the effects of valve defects on the heart, studying the effects of shock, and his pioneering efforts along with Dr. Claude Beck and others in techniques of resuscitation from death in the operating room. He is perhaps most famous for his authoring of the Wiggers diagram, a diagram commonly used in teaching of cardiovascular research. After retiring as professor emeritus in 1953, Wiggers joined the Frank Bunts Institute of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, taking part in postgraduate training for student doctors and in medical and scientific seminars.

Headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, United States, it has a global presence in the fields of meteorology, analytics, and related services, and also provides Internet Access DSL and Web hosting services. The company strengths for natural gas and energy markets now creates forecasts spanning industries such as media and web content found in the United States and foreign countries. Company history Charlie Notis and Harvey Freese both were students at Iowa State University in 1973. The company originated on the Iowa State University campus in nearby Ames while they were post-grad students at Iowa State during the 1973 oil crisis. The partnership was formalized on May 1, 1973 with a typewriter as its first piece of office equipment and acted as collateral for shares of stock. A friend of Harvey and Charlie suggest to name the enterprise \\"Freese-Notis Weather.\\" During the first couple years of existence, some of the radio listeners during the summer months would get confused when the radio announcer would introduce the Freese- Notis forecast that some thought was a \\"freeze-notice\\" forecast.

An indoor water park has the ability to stay open year-round, as it is not affected by weather conditions. History Some of the first indoor water parks are at Duinrell (The Netherlands, 1984), Nautiland located at Haguenau (France, 1984), the Aqua Mundo at Center Parc De Eemhof located at Zeewolde (The Netherlands, 1980) and (Switerland, 1977). In 1986 an indoor water park was open in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada at the West Edmonton Mall. It is called the World Waterpark and is over . It was a success for the mall and remains as one of the largest indoor water parks in the world. In 1985 opened in France. Another indoor water park in Europe was built in Blackpool in 1986. It is called the Sandcastle Water Park. The first indoor water park in the United States known as Great Wolf Lodge was built in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin at the Polynesian Hotel. It was built in 1994 in an effort to make the Dells a year-round tourist destination, rather than just a summer one. Since then, the Great Wolf Lodge brand has expanded, with multiple locations in the U.S. and a single venue in Canada, at Niagara Falls. The DreamWorks Water Park, originally slated to open in late 2019, will be the United States' largest water park upon opening. The indoor water park craze Since the opening of the first park, the indoor water park business has become increasingly popular, especially for the Edmonton area in Canada, and in the Wisconsin Dells in the U.S., which proclaims itself as the \\"Water Park Capital of the World\\". The Dells has five Water park resorts that have at least one water park bigger than . This includes Great Wolf Lodge, Kalahari (Wisconsin's Largest Indoor Water Park), Chula Vista Resort (Lost Rios), Wilderness Territory (Wild West, Klondike Kavern, Wild WaterDome), and the Hotel Rome at Mt. Olympus. Wisconsin has the most indoor water parks in one state. Other states in the U.S., especially in the midwest, are building more indoor water parks separate or to existing hotels so they can become a year-round destination. More water parks are also being built in Canada, Europe and Asia.

Praised by audiences and music critics alike for the electrifying force of her acting and the excellence of her singing in both German and Italian works, her career was curtailed at its peak in 1906 by a medical condition which paralyzed a nerve in her face. Career Promotional photograph of Milka T(e)rnina as Tosca, taken for the Met premiere of the opera of the same name in 1901. A native of Vezi≈°ƒáe (part of Kri≈æ), the young Trnina (usually referred to as Milka Ternina in English-speaking countries) studied singing privately with Ida Winterberg in Zagreb and then with Joseph G√§nsbacher at the conservatory in Vienna, graduating from his class in 1883 with a gold medal. She had made her operatic debut while still a student in Zagreb, singing Amelia in an 1882 production of Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera. Ternina sang initially as a full-time professional performer in Leipzig and subsequently took up a position with the resident operatic company in Graz in 1884. She stayed there for two years, acquiring a useful knowledge of stagecraft and manifesting a burning devotion to opera as a serious art form. The conductor Anton Seidl was impressed by Ternina's potential and he recommended her to replace another acclaimed dramatic soprano, Katharina Klafsky, at the Bremen Opera. While in Bremen, she participated in a production of Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle (her first). In 1890, she was engaged by the Munich Royal Opera, where, over the next few years, she consolidated her reputation as a top-class singer and distinguished herself as an outstanding exponent of Wagnerian music dramas. She excelled, too, as Beethoven's Leonore. Ternina's North American debut took place in Boston in 1896, when she sang Br√ºnnhilde in Die Walk√ºre with the Damrosch Opera Company. In 1898, she appeared for the first time in opera in London, performing Isolde in Tristan und Isolde. She would continue to appear at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, until 1906, achieving a total of 98 appearances there in a variety of operas. Ternina appeared at the 1899 Bayreuth Festival in the role of Kundry in Parsifal. According to Oxford's concise operatic dictionary, this would prove to be her sole appearance at Bayreuth. On January 27, 1900, Ternina made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City as Elisabeth in Tannh√§user. During her fruitful association with the Met she sang Kundry in Parsifal's first American performance. Because this staging of the opera was not authorized by the Wagner family, she was never again invited to appear at Bayreuth, despite her stature as an artist. Ternina famously sang the title role in the 1901 American premiere of Giacomo Puccini's Tosca, performing the part at the Met to considerable acclaim on 18 further occasions. The previous year she had been London's first Floria Tosca, too, with the composer, who had been in the audience at Covent Garden that night, describing her interpretation as \\"ideal\\". She thus became the English-speaking world's most renowned interpreter of this particular Puccini heroine. =Retirement and later life= Milka Trnina memorial in Vezi≈°ƒáe In early May 1902, while on vacation in Switzerland, Ternina suffered an attack of facial paralysis which affected the left side of her mouth. The ailment did not yield to medical treatment and she decided to retire from the stage at the height of her powers, as she believed it was no longer possible for her to maintain the highest level of performance. Die Walk√ºre in Munich, on September 1, 1906, was her last stage appearance. For a year she taught singing at the Institute of Musical Art in New York City, after which she withdrew from the international music scene and returned to Zagreb. One of her pupils in New York was Lucia Dunham. Her best known pupil in Zagreb was the celebrated spinto soprano and Metropolitan Opera star Zinka Milanov. Ternina died in Zagreb in 1941, aged 77. She did not make any commercial recordings of her voice but fragments of her singing can be discerned on Mapleson Cylinders recorded live at the Met at the start of the 20th century. These are available on a CD re-issue by Symposium Records (catalogue number 1284). References External links * David Ewen, Encyclopedia of the Opera: New Enlarged Edition.

This act effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide, excluding a few states. The sports lotteries conducted in Oregon, Delaware, and Montana were exempt, as well as the licensed sports pools in Nevada. In addition, Congress provided a one-year window of opportunity from the effective date of PASPA (January 1, 1993) for states which operated licensed casino gaming for the previous ten- year period to pass laws permitting sports wagering. The latter exception was clearly crafted with New Jersey in mind. However, New Jersey failed to take advantage of this opportunity. Excluded from the reach of PASPA are jai alai, as well as parimutuel horse and dog racing. In a May 2018 decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that PASPA conflicts with the Tenth Amendment. History On June 26, 1991, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks held public hearings on sports gambling. It found \\"(s)ports gambling is a national problem. The harms it inflicts are felt beyond the borders of those States that sanction it.\\" David Stern, the then-commissioner for the National Basketball Association, testified that \\"The interstate ramifications of sports betting are a compelling reason for federal legislation.\\" In light of these findings, Congress exercised its authority under the Commerce Clause to enact Senate Bill 474 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 1992, codified at 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 3701. Legislative efforts against the act New Jersey has been a leader, both in legislation and in the legal process, in support of the legalization of sports betting in New Jersey despite its original failure to take advantage of the carve out in the PASPA of 1992. The law is also known as the \\"Bradley Act\\", named for New Jersey Senator and former NBA star Bill Bradley. New Jersey voters in 2011 voted for a state constitutional amendment that would permit sports gambling. The next year, the NJ State Legislature enacted the Sports Wagering Act (\\"2012 Act\\"), allowing sports wagering at New Jersey casinos and racetracks. Legal challenges Proponents of repeal typically assert that the law as written is inherently unconstitutional, as the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution reserves to the states all rights not explicitly granted to the federal government‚Äîsuch as gambling regulation. While the primarily legal challenge to the law came from New Jersey, other efforts to overturn it had been set in motion before the Supreme Court's decision in May 2018; this included a sports-betting bill being introduced in Kentucky, as well as the other states who are in the process of creating and or passing some form of sports betting legislation and the formation of the pro-repeal American Sports Betting Coalition, a lobby alliance which includes the American Gaming Association and the National Indian Gaming Association. PASPA was formally challenged in the state of New Jersey. In March 2009, New Jersey State Senator Raymond Lesniak filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey claiming, among other things, that the PASPA unconstitutionally discriminated among the states by allowing four states to offer sports betting while disallowing the other forty-six states from enjoying the privilege; however the case was dismissed as the court argued that only then-Governor Chris Christie could bring the suit, and at that time, Christie believed it would be difficult to challenge the law. A 2010 referendum showed overwhelming support by state voters to legalize sports gambling, and by 2012, the state passed a law that would allow for sports gambling at licensed locations. This law was challenged by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, the National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball in August 2012, arguing their new law violated PASPA. The state argued that they knew their law likely violated PASPA, but argued that PASPA itself violated the Tenth Amendment's protection against anti-commandeering federal laws that stripped the power of the state to repeal their own sports gambling ban. This case, heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, found for the sports leagues, dismissing the state's claims regarding PASPA. New Jersey appealed the decision. On September 17, 2013, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision by Judge Julio M. Fuentes, found for the sports leagues, again ruling that the state law violated PASPA and enjoined the state from enacting the law. However, the Appeals Court also ruled that PASPA did not prevent New Jersey from repealing any existing laws it had. Based on the Appeal Court's comment, New Jersey, now with Governor Christie's blessing, passed a new law in 2014 that repealed a former state law that banned sports gambling. The four leagues and the NCAA filed suite against this new law, again arguing that it violated PASPA. The leagues and the NCAA prevailed both at District Court and at an en banc decisions from the Third Circuit by August 2016, leading the state to petition the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the case. New Jersey appealed this case to the United States Supreme Court, requesting examination of PASPA under the anti-commandeering provisions of the Tenth Amendment. The Supreme Court accepted the case in June 2017 and heard oral arguments in December 2017; during this time, Governor Christie stepped down and was replaced by Phil Murphy; the case before the court became Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association. The case was combined with a separate petition NJ Thoroughbred Horsemen v. NCAA, representing commercial interests related to PASPA.

Players race through the game zone solving clues and performing tasks with the aid of a cell phone and digital camera in an effort to earn the most points. The Go Game advertises itself as ‚Äúthe future of corporate play,‚Äù and was voted ‚ÄúBest Way to Rediscover Your City‚Äù by the SF Weekly.  History  In 2001, Ian Fraser and Finnegan Kelly started running interactive street games for friends that used cellphones as part of the game, an original concept at the time, based in the Mission District. Fraser said that the idea and name had come to him in a dream about a journey. They then ran larger games and started charging players to participate in the game, which grew into The Go Game as a company. In 2009, they started a game office in the United Kingdom. In 2010, they had 11 employees and noted the company was self-funded. As of 2011, they had run more than 10,000 games, mostly team building games for companies, and they had $3 million in annual revenue, with games costing $50-100 per player to run. At the South by Southwest conference in 2011, they released an iPhone application for creating and participating in local scavenger hunts, which was compared to the SCVNGR app. GigaOM called the app \\"an interesting example of the gamification of work\\", since the target use was teambuilding exercises. They have also organized games that teach disaster preparedness as well as serving as entertainment, such as a \\"zombie survival\\" game run in coordination with the city of San Francisco. The Go Game also ran a \\"heroes\\" themed game with the city to encourage preparing for natural disasters; a city representative's blog connected this to themes of gamification and \\"Government 2.0\\".  Gameplay  Players receive customized cellphones that provide location-based clues about missions and puzzles to complete, and actors participate in the game as characters.

He played the peak of his career for Sunderland, in a period of time in the club's history where they were dubbed the 'team of all talents'. Noted for his exceptional performances in goal, he was also famously shy of his bald head, and always wore a cap. If during a football game the cap blew off at any point, he would chase after it rather than concentrate on the game. He set a 19th-century world record by not conceding any goals in 87 of his 290 top division appearances (30%).https://iffhs.de/history-curiosities-of-world-football-1891-1900/ Early career Born in Arbroath, Doig began his career as an outside right with local junior club St. Helena. He moved to Arbroath F.C. in 1884 after a member of the crowd shouted \\"let Doig play!\\" prior to a reserve team kick off; Arbroath were without a goalkeeper and the young Ned Doig was in the audience. He spent two seasons in the reserves before breaking through to the first team in 1886 at the age of 19. He achieved two full Scottish international caps whilst with Arbroath, and remains the club's highest capped player. Sunderland In November 1889 Doig was signed by Blackburn Rovers. After one game he had a disagreement with the Lancashire club and decided to return home. In 1890, Doig returned to England to play for Sunderland. However, because Doig had not been registered with the club for seven days, and therefore still effectively a Blackburn player, the Football League deemed him ineligible for his debut game. As Sunderland did play him, they were fined and deducted two points. Doig went on to be an ever-present in goal for the Wearsiders in the 14 seasons he spent at the club, winning four league championships in the process. When the Sunderland fanzine/website A Love Supreme made a list of the club's greatest ever players, chosen from seasonal statistics, Doig came out as number one. In 2017 a small group was founded to commemorate the life of Doig, the group known as the Ned Doig Ultras are a left-leaning supporters group. The group's founding member is Iain Hutchinson. He gained his further four Scottish international caps at Sunderland, the first in a 2‚Äì1 victory over England at Celtic Park, which was the first ever international game with a crowd of over 50,000, and also broke England's (still) record of twenty consecutive wins. Late career Doig signed for recently relegated Liverpool for a fee of ¬£150 in 1904. In his first season with the Merseysiders, he helped the club achieve immediate promotion back to the top division. However, the next season saw his place lost to future England star Sam Hardy. He played his last game in April 1908, at the age of 41 years and 165 days, which is still a Liverpool record. He finished his career with the amateur club St. Helens Recreationals in the Lancashire league, finally retiring in 1910. The grave of John Edward \\"Ned\\" Doig at Anfield Cemetery in Liverpool.

She was sister to Lucilla and Commodus. Her maternal grandparents were Antoninus Pius and Faustina the Elder, and her paternal grandparents were Domitia Lucilla and praetor Marcus Annius Verus. She was named in honor of her late paternal aunt Annia Cornificia Faustina.  Life  Cornificia Faustina was born and raised in Rome and later married the African Roman politician Marcus Petronius Sura Mamertinus, who served as consul in 182. Sometime after 173, she bore him a son called Petronius Antoninus. It is possible that she and her family were at the winter camp where Marcus Aurelius died in early 180. Her brother Commodus succeeded her father as emperor and, sometime between 190 and 192, he ordered the deaths of her husband, her son, her brother-in-law and her sister-in-law's family. Cornificia survived the political executions of Commodus and later married Lucius Didius Marinus, a powerful Roman noble of equestrian rank who served as Procurator in various provinces. He later became a tax collector and tribune of the first Praetorian cohort. During the brief reign of Pertinax (193), she was involved in an affair with the emperor. In 212, when she was in her fifties, Caracalla ordered her death, thus eliminating the last surviving child of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger. Historian Cassius Dio recorded the manner of her death: : Her last words were 'My poor, unhappy soul, trapped in an unworthy body, go forth, be free, show them that you are the daughter of Marcus Aurelius!' Then she took off her ornaments, composed herself, opened her veins, and died.

Biography Bispham was born on January 5, 1857 in Philadelphia, the only child of William Danforth Bispham and Jane Lippincott Scull.W. Bispham, 274 Both of Bispham's parents were members of the Society of Friends. In 1867, the family relocated to Moorestown Township, New Jersey. In 1872, Bispham entered Haverford College, from which he was graduated in 1876. After graduation, Bispham entered the wool business with his mother's brothers, all the while continuing to develop his musical talents as an amateur. Bispham appeared in numerous musical performances in his childhood despite having no formal musical training. In 1885, Bispham married Caroline Russell, the daughter of General Charles Sawyer Russell. They would go on to have four children: Jeanette, Vida, Leonie, and David. The Bisphams honeymooned in Europe, and when they returned to Philadelphia, Bispham found work with the Lehigh Valley Railroad.W. Bispham, 275 While employed with the railroad, Bispham spent his spare time singing with local clubs and an Episcopal church choir in Philadelphia. = Early music career = At twenty-eight he went to Europe, studying singing in Florence with Luigi Vannuccini and in Milan with Francesco Lamperti. He also studied in Bayreuth. In 1891 he was selected from among fifty applicants to perform the role of the Duc de Longueville in a London performance of Andr√© Messager's La Basoche; this marked his first professional appearance on any stage. = Covent Garden = He was engaged by the Royal Opera at Covent Garden to sing the part of Beckmesser in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg in June 1892. This production was also to feature Jean de Reszke, Emma Albani, and Jean Lassalle in the other leading roles. De Reszke fell ill during rehearsals, and the production had to be cancelled. On the day of the cancellation, however, Bispham was asked to substitute on the following day as Kurwenal in Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, under Gustav Mahler. This was Bispham's first Wagner role. According to his memoir, referred to below, Bispham had previously learned that role and several others following the advice of a medium at a seance. His success there brought him a contract for Covent Garden, where he appeared, primarily in Wagnerian roles, for all but two of the next ten seasons. = American career = Siegfried, circa 1902 Bispham made his American debut, once again in Wagner, at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on November 18, 1896; that night he sang the role of Sixtus Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. He remained with the company until 1903, singing mainly Wagnerian roles; he also appeared in the American premieres of Ignace Paderewski's Manru and Ethel Smyth's Der Wald. Bispham was influential in establishing the career of Carrie Jacobs-Bond as in 1901 he gave a recital exclusively featuring her songs in Chicago's Studebaker Theatre.Previously in 1901 Jacobs-Bond had published her Seven Songs as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose (which included \\"I Love You Truly\\" and \\"Just Awearyin' for You\\"). After 1903 Bispham's operatic appearances were few, and he devoted most of his time to recitals, with which he had much success. He made a point of singing English versions of songs by such composers as Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Robert Schumann. In 1916 he appeared in an English-language version of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Der Schauspieldirektor in New York. The performance was such a success that it led to the formation of the Society of American Singers; the company, with Bispham's inspiration, gave three seasons of light operas in English. Bispham's commitment to opera in English also led, after his death, to the creation of the Bispham Memorial Medal Award, to be awarded to operas in English by American composers. He was a 'strong' advocate for performing vocal music in the audience's language. He was a close personal friend of American soprano Lillian Nordica, with whom he travelled to Australia on her last tour before her death. He was also a frequent professional colleague of both De Reszke brothers (Jean and Edouard), Olive Fremstad, Ernestine Schumann-Heink and Dame Clara Butt, among singers, and Hans Richter, Arthur Nikisch, Felix Mottl, Anton Seidl and Walter Damrosch, among conductors. Damrosch's setting of Rudyard Kipling's \\"Danny Deever\\", as sung by Bispham, became a favorite of President Theodore Roosevelt. Bispham was the first singer to introduce Brahms's Four Serious Songs and Magelone Lieder to American audiences in the 1896-97 concert season. Bispham also sang Horatio Parker's oratorio, Hora Novissima, in 1897 (with Johanna Gadski, Gertrude May Stein, and Evan Williams as the other soloists). Upon his immediate return to Great Britain, he provided a copy of the score to Hans Richter, which led to the premiere of the piece in Worcester, England, and the Festival of the Three Choirs. In 1902, Bispham began teaching singing in Philadelphia. In 1908, he was awarded national honorary membership in Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. When Jacobs-Bond published \\"A Perfect Day\\" in 1910 she added the header \\"As sung by Mr. David Bispham\\" above the title (the header appears on p. 3 of the sheet music). Jacobs-Bond wrote \\"A Perfect Day\\" (q.v.) in 1909 and first published it in 1910.The facts of publication and the sheet music are available on the Johns Hopkins University site. In 1915, Nelson Eddy, future baritone and actor, began studying singing under Bispham in Philadelphia. =Death= David Bispham tombstone in Laurel Hill Cemetery Bispham died in Manhattan, New York City on October 2, 1921. He was buried in Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery.Laurel Hill Cemetery His widow and daughter challenged his will in probate court alleging that there was undue influence. Legacy  He wrote a memoir of his professional career called A Quaker Singer's Recollections, published by Macmillan in January 1920. Although it makes no mention whatsoever of his personal life, his marriage, or his children, the book is a valuable insight into the life and times of the international opera singer of his day and source of much first-hand information regarding the state of the vocal art and especially a singer's repertoire of the era. His legacy lives on in the form of gramophone recordings of songs and arias, some of which have been reissued on CD. He also paved the way for such outstanding American baritones of later generations as Clarence Whitehill, Richard Bonelli, Arthur Endreze, John Charles Thomas, Lawrence Tibbett, Leonard Warren and Robert Merrill. The David Bispham Medal is awarded by the American Opera Society of Chicago to promote the composition and performance of American opera.

History  The magazine was started by George J. Hecht in 1926. The magazine was originally titled Children, The Magazine for Parents. Hecht hired Clara Savage Littledale to be its first editor. The first issue was published in October 1926 and soon was selling 100,000 copies a month. Beginning with the August 1929 issue, the name was changed to Parents' Magazine (with an apostrophe). Littledale was followed as editor by Mary Buchanan. In 1937, the magazine was granted trademark registration for the mark Parents' Magazine.http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/FSupp/793/1222/1369335/ From 1941‚Äì1965, Parents' Magazine Press published a line of comic books and magazines heavily featuring comics, including such long-running titles as Calling All Girls, Children's Digest, Polly Pigtails, True Comics, and True Picture-Magazine.Parents Magazine Press, Grand Comics Database. Accessed Feb. 29, 2016. Parents Magazine Press also published Humpty Dumpty from the 1950s through the early 1980s, until it and Children's Digest were sold to the Saturday Evening Post company. Parents' Magazine was sold to Gruner + Jahr in 1978. At that time, the magazine was \\"relaunched\\" and its name was shortened, utilizing only the word \\"Parents\\", without an apostrophe.http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/FSupp/793/1222/1369335/ Elizabeth Crow became the magazine's editor for the next decade. In 1992, Gruner + Jahr filed suit against Meredith for trademark infringement of Parents when Meredith published Parent's Digest. With the court finding no actual confusion of the products (though there was testimony from managers and employees as to inquiries about a possible relationship between the publications), the case was dismissed.http://www.leagle.com/decision/19932063991F2d1072_11905/GRUNER%20+%20JAHR%20USA%20PUB.%20v.%20MEREDITH%20CORP.

Profile  Its editorial focus is on the daily needs and concerns of mothers with young children. The glossy monthly features information about child health, safety, behavior, discipline and education. There are also stories on women's health, nutrition, pregnancy, marriage, and beauty. It is aimed primarily at women ages 18‚Äì35 with young children. Columns include \\"As They Grow,\\" which cover age-specific child development issues, as well as the reader-generated \\"Baby Bloopers,\\" \\"It Worked for Me,\\" and \\"Goody Bag.\\" The magazine also produces a website, an iPhone app for kids, Parents Flash Cards, and GoodyBlog.com, the now-defunct blog.

It is located south of Pelican Butte and southeast of Mount McLoughlin. It rises over above the nearby shore of Upper Klamath Lake. Ice Age glaciers carved three large cirques into the north and northeast flanks of the mountain removing most of the original summit area including any evidence of a crater. The summit is now the high point along the curving ridge which bounds the southern edge of the cirques above steep cliffs. Aspen Butte is the highest of four overlapping shield volcanoes within the Mountain Lakes Wilderness all of which have been carved to varying degrees by glaciers. The other volcanoes are Mount Harriman, Crater Mountain and Greylock Mountain. Another peak, Mount Carmine, which lies just over to the north of Aspen Butte, is actually not a separate volcano but the highest remnant of the north flank of the Aspen Butte volcano separated from it by two glacial cirques.

The basic distinguishing characteristic of the pylon station is the manner of division of the central hall from the station tunnels The pylon station consists of three separate halls, separated from each other by a row of pylons with passages between them. The independence of the halls allows the architectural form of the central and side halls to be differentiated. This was especially characteristic for stations built in the 1960s, when as a result of the policy of \\"total economy,\\" the side halls and tunnel walls were significantly poorer than the central hall. Building stations of the pylon type is preferable in difficult geological situations, as such a station is better able to oppose earth pressure. However, the limited number of narrow passages limits the throughput between the halls. London-type station The pylon station was the earliest type of deep underground station. One variation is the so-called \\"London-style station.\\" In such stations the central hall is reduced to the size of an anteroom, leading to the inclined walkway or elevators. In some cases the anteroom is also the base of the escalators. In the countries of the former USSR there is currently only one such station: Arsenalna in Kiev.

The characters are usually members of an outlaw motorcycle club. History Outlaw biker clubs formed in the late 1940s on the West Coast after the end of World War II. Their culture was first popularized in the Marlon Brando film The Wild One (1953), which tells a story based very loosely on actual events. The film's success was followed by a string of low-budget exploitation films aimed at a teenage audience such as Motorcycle Gang (1957) and The Hot Angel (1958). But the genre really took off in the mid-1960s, after the Hells Angels motorcycle club became prominent in the media, in particular, after Hunter S. Thompson's book Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (1966) was published. =Films of the 1960s= In 1965, director Russ Meyer made Motorpsycho (aka Motor Psycho), an obscure film about an evil motorcycle gang led by a disturbed Vietnam War veteran. In 1966, American International Pictures (AIP) released The Wild Angels with Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, and Nancy Sinatra. This film, aimed at the teenage drive-in crowd, was a surprise hit and a new exploitation film subgenre was born. AIP dominated the market and quickly released a semi-sequel Devil's Angels starring actor-director John Cassavetes and The Glory Stompers with Dennis Hopper in 1967. In 1968, AIP produced The Mini-Skirt Mob, Angels from Hell, and The Savage Seven (the film debut of actress/director Penny Marshall). The company made five more biker gang films: Hell's Belles (1969), Hell's Angels '69 (1969), Angel Unchained (1970), The Hard Ride (1971), and Chrome and Hot Leather (1971). AIP and Fanfare Films also co-produced The Born Losers (1967). Fanfare made Hells Angels on Wheels (1967) with Jack Nicholson, Run, Angel, Run! (1969), Wild Wheels (1969), and Nam's Angels (1970). Other small independent filmmakers went on to produce dozens of low-budget biker films until the trend dissipated in the early '70s. Crown International produced and/or distributed Wild Rebels (1967), The Hellcats (1968), The Sidehackers (1969), Wild Riders (1971), and Pink Angels (1972). Independent-International Pictures Corp. produced three films in this genre directed by Al Adamson ‚Äì Satan's Sadists (1969), Hell's Bloody Devils (1970), and Angels' Wild Women (1972). The Rebel Rousers (filmed 1967, released 1970) featured Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, and Harry Dean Stanton. Dern also starred as a sadistic gang leader in The Cycle Savages (1970). In 1969, Peter Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson teamed up on the classic \\"hippie biker\\" movie, Easy Rider, the antithesis of the violent biker-gang genre. Sonny Barger, founder of the Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels, was a consultant on several films. He and other gang members appeared as extras in Hells Angels on Wheels and Hell's Angels '69. The Hells Angels appeared as extras playing a gang called the Las Vegas Hotdoggers in the Roger Corman film Naked Angels (1969) starring Michael Greene. =The Born Losers= The Born Losers (1967) introduced Tom Laughlin's character Billy Jack. Unable to get his Billy Jack script produced, Laughlin wrote and directed The Born Losers to capitalize on the current biker movie trend (which finally allowed him to make Billy Jack in 1971). The story was inspired by news reports of the Hells Angels terrorizing a California community. As a cost-saving measure, a stunt scene of a motorcycle crashing into a pond was taken from co-producer AIP's comedy The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini (1966). The Born Losers is also significant for its social criticism and portrayal of the biker gang as a force of pure, unredeemable evil. Here, for the first time, a lone hero stands up to, and ultimately defeats, the gang. Prior to this, the majority of the films in this genre imitated The Wild One with a sympathetic gang member (the reluctant leader or a new member) who ultimately rejects the outlaw biker lifestyle. Prime examples are the Fonda character in The Wild Angels, Jack Nicholson in Hells Angels on Wheels (1967), and Joe Namath in C.C. and Company (1970). Jack Starrett has the role of a tough-talking police officer. He played essentially the same character in Hells Angels on Wheels and Angels from Hell (1968). Starrett was also in Hell's Bloody Devils (1970), and directed Run, Angel, Run (1969) . In Nam's Angels (1970) the bikers are portrayed as patriotic heroes sent on a rescue mission to Vietnam. =Novelty biker films= A number of novelty films were made featuring all-female biker gangs such as The Hellcats aka Biker Babes (1967), She-Devils on Wheels (1968), The Mini-Skirt Mob (from AIP) with Sherry Jackson and Harry Dean Stanton (1968), Sisters in Leather (1969) with Pat Barrington, Angels' Wild Women (1972), Cycle Vixens (1978), and Chrome Angels (2009). The Pink Angels (1971) is a somewhat campy film about a gang of homosexual bikers who head down the coast to attend a drag ball. Bury Me an Angel (1972) is a revenge story featuring a female biker (and female director). Angels' Wild Women (1972) centers around a group of tough female bikers who dominate men and eventually go a revenge-driven rampage. The story (and original Screaming Angels title) was changed after the producers found theaters were no longer interested in traditional biker films. Inspired by the popularity of Roger Corman's The Big Doll House (1971), a violent women in prison film with Pam Grier, new scenes were added featuring aggressive female bikers and a Pam Grier lookalike was added to the cast. The reworked and retitled film was a box office success. In Japan, female biker films became popular starting with Alleycat Rock: Female Boss (a.k.a. Stray Cat Rock: Delinquent Girl Boss or Female Juvenile Delinquent Leader: Alleycat Rock or Wildcat Rock) (1970). This trend was part of the sukeban (delinquent girl) subgenre of Toei's \\"Pinky violence\\" style of Pink film. The series continued with Stray Cat Rock: Wild Jumbo, Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter, Stray Cat Rock: Machine Animal and Alleycat Rock: Crazy Riders '71. Another similar series of exploitation films with female bikers includes Delinquent Girl Boss: Ballad of the Yokohama Hoods (1971), Girl Boss: Queen Bee Strikes Again (a.k.a. Girl Boss Blues: Queen Bee‚Äôs Counterattack) (1971), and Girl Boss Guerilla (1972). =The 1970s to the present= In 1970, Roger Corman left AIP to form New World Pictures which released Angels Die Hard (1970), Angels Hard as They Come (1971), and Bury Me an Angel (1971). As the trend began to lose momentum, filmmakers started to create horror hybrids such as Werewolves on Wheels (1971) and Blood Freak (1972). The British horror film Psychomania (1971) involves a biker gang that makes a pact with the devil to obtain immortality. Black motorcycle gangs appeared in a few blaxploitation films such as The Black Angels (1970) and The Black Six (1974). The biker gang ethos also featured strongly in the famed low budget Australian production Mad Max (1979, dir. George Miller, starring Mel Gibson), with the film spawning the real-life subculture of survival bikes. By the late 1980s, the once shocking and controversial genre became an object of campy humor in horror-comedies such as Chopper Chicks in Zombietown (1989), I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle (1990), and Biker Zombies (2001). Beyond the Law (1992) is based on a true story and centers on Dan Saxon (Charlie Sheen), an undercover cop who infiltrates a group of criminal outlaw bikers. Larry Ferguson wrote the screenplay after reading the article \\"Undercover Angel\\" by Lawrence Linderman in the July, 1981 issue of Playboy on an undercover agent named Dan Black. 2000 film Hochelaga, a French-Canadian movie by Michel Jett√© that depicts biker gang culture and activity in Montr√©al, Qu√©bec during the Qu√©bec Biker War of the late 90s and early 2000s. 2003 film Biker Boyz, starring Laurence Fishburne and Djimon Hounsou, depicts illegal bike racing gangs, although neither are criminals. 2004 film Torque, which features Adam Scott, Martin Henderson and Ice Cube, is about a biker who is faced by a rival gang leader for taking his bikes (which carry drugs), and is then framed for the murder of a member of a third gang. Quentin Tarantino served as executive producer on Hell Ride (2008) starring Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen. This is an homage to the motorcycle gang films of the past. It was written and directed by Larry Bishop, who acted in a number of biker films such as The Savage Seven (1968). Tarantino is a noted fan of the Australian biker movie, Stone (1974).http://www.takethetripagain.com/release003.html Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014) is an American television drama series about a California motorcycle club. The series premiered on September 3, 2008, on cable network FX. The documentary Biker Mania (2009) includes a compilation of theater trailers and footage that tracks the history of the genre from the 1950s to the present. Edward Winterhalder is the subject of a feature-length documentary movie about the outlaw biker lifestyle that is being filmed in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Dubai. Cultural references and parodies After the release of The Wild One (1953), the image of the motorcycle gang, particularly the Marlon Brando character, inspired many imitators and satires in films and television shows. =Film= * From 1963 to 1966 American International Pictures produced a series of seven Beach party films.

The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 14 November 1631. Like the majority of Shirley's dramas, it was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 25 April 1639 by the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke, along with three other Shirley plays. (The three were The Opportunity, The Coronation, and The Night Walker.) The play was published the next year, in a quarto printed by Thomas Cotes -- though only Andrew Crooke's name is on the title page. Shirley based his plot on material from two sources: novel 36 of the Heptameron of Marguerite of Navarre, and novel 6, decade 3, of the Hecatomithi of Cinthio. Shirley may have accessed Marguerite's tale in English translation in The Palace of Pleasure by William Painter. Shirley's work also bears a significant resemblance to Thomas Heywood's A Woman Killed with Kindness.Robert Stanley Forsythe, The Relations of Shirley's Plays to the Elizabethan Drama, New York, Columbia University Press, 1914; pp. 164-5. Among its other features, Love's Cruelty contains a noteworthy indication of the influence of the masque on the mind of the contemporary audience. The masque -- which Inigo Jones, probably its greatest artistic innovator, termed \\"pictures with light and motion\\" -- was the seventeenth century's closest analogue to the modern cinema spectacular. In Shirley's play, the character Hippolito offers a contemporaneous response to the spectacles of the form: :A scene to take your eye with wonder, now to see a forest move, and the pride of summer brought into a walking wood; in the instant, as if the sea had swallowed up the earth, to see waves capering about tall ships...In the height of this rapture, a tempest so artificial and sudden in the clouds, with a general darkness and thunder, so seeming made to threaten, that you would cry out with the mariners in the work, you cannot escape drowning. Not long after, Shirley would himself write perhaps the most successful masque of his generation in The Triumph of Peace (1634). As a boy player, Nicholas Burt was noted for his performance as Clariana; Michael Mohun took the role of Bellamente both before and after the theatre closure of 1642-60.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Other Persons Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 79, 252. Love's Cruelty was revived early in the Restoration era; it was acted at the Red Bull Theatre on Thursday 15 November 1660. Samuel Pepys saw another performance of the play on 30 December 1667; he judged it \\"a very silly play.\\"Arthur Huntington Nason, James Shirley, Dramatist: A Biographical and Critical Study, New York, 1915; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1967; pp. 154, 157. Synopsis The play is set in the northern Italian city of Ferrara. Bellamente and Clariana are engaged to be married. She is interested to meet Bellamente's close and highly praised friend Hippolito. She visits him in disguise; he is called away to answer a summons from the city's Duke, and locks her in his room. Delayed longer than he expected, Hippolito sends his friend Bellamente to release the mysterious woman; Bellamente is astonished to find this fianc√©e, but accepts her explanation, and eventually married her. Clariana, however, commits adultery with Hippolito. They are caught by a servant, who informs Bellamente--who, after an internal debate, lets the pair off unpunished, largely to conceal his own dishonor. The Duke of Farrara is attempting to seduce a young woman named Eubella; he employs Hippolito as his advocate. Yet Hippolito feels guilty about his betrayal of Bellamente's trust, and is charmed by Eubella's innocence and virtue; he proposes marriage to the girl. The Duke learns of this, but his own guilt leads him to bless their intended marriage. Clariana doesn't feel the same way: desirous to break up the marriage, Clariana summons Hippolito to her chamber under a false pretext on the morning of his intended wedding. Hippolito has no interest in Clariana, and rejects her attempted interference; but they are caught together, once more. Clariana stabs Hippolito, who in turn wounds her with his sword. Clariana confesses her fault to her husband, then dies; and Hippolito also dies after seeing Eubella one last time. Bellamente dies of shock; the Duke marries Eubella himself.

North Australian Railway 1975 Bailey Island Bridge, Harpswell, ME. The only granite cribstone bridge in the world. A box crib or cribbing is a temporary wooden structure used to support heavy objects during construction, relocation, vehicle extrication and urban search and rescue. It is commonly used to secure overturned motor vehicles, and debris within collapsed buildings. Cribbing is often used in conjunction with other stabilization equipment, such as pneumatic or hydraulic shoring. Cribbing is also used in sub-surface mining as a roof support. Cribbing has largely been replaced by hydraulic shoring in modern mining applications. Some forms of cribbing can be used on movie sets and/or production sites for stabilizing dolly tracks, platforms, and various temporary structures when quick setup times are needed. Stability The stability of a crib is affected by a variety of factors: the material used (often a soft wood which gives audible warnings before failure), the number of contact points between the crib and the supported surface, the ratio of the footprint of the crib to its height, and the area of contact made between the crib and the ground and supported surface. Materials Cribbing is usually accomplished with blocks of wood, often 4\\"x4\\" or 6\\"x6\\" and 18\\"-24\\" long. Soft woods, like spruce and pine are often preferred because they crack slowly and make loud noises before completely failing, whereas stiffer woods may fail explosively and without warning. Cribbing may also be made out of plastic, which unlike wood is not susceptible to rot or corrosion from fluids the cribbing may come in contact with (e.g. oil, gasoline, hydraulic fluid). Cribbing equipment is normally of three varieties: rectangular blocks, wedges (also called shims), and \\"step chocks\\" (large wooden chocks constructed of wood of different lengths). Blocks are the bread and butter of cribbing and will be used in most cribbing evolutions. Shims are used to snug up contact between the crib and supported object or change the direction of the crib (tilt). Step chocks are often used as a quick solution for stabilizing vehicles on all fours or to quickly increase the height of a crib. Methods Cribbing structures are often categorized by shape. Different shapes of cribbing structures are chosen depending on the area available and the point being cribbed to. A box crib is the simplest, most stable and most common method of cribbing. It is constructed by arranging sets (2 or more) of matched blocks in a regular log-cabin style to form a rising square or rectangular frame. The more blocks on each level, the greater the number of support points and therefore the greater the strength of the crib tower. In trench rescue training materials three basic types of box cribbing are the 4-point, 9-point and full crib. The four point type has two timbers on each level thus four points of contact. Three timbers on each layer makes nine points of contact. The full crib type has each layer filled with timbers. Each point of contact carries a maximum load depending on the size and species of the timbers.Martinette, C. V.. Trench rescue : awareness, operations, technician. Sudbury, Mass.: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2008. 128-129. A triangle or A' crib is similar to the box crib, except it resembles a triangular prism instead of rectangular.

A 'tilted tower crib is a box crib in which pairs of shims are used to change the direction of the rising structure, resulting in a curve.Connell, John P.. Collapse operations for first responders. Tulsa, Okla.: Penn Well Corp., 2012. 94-95. Curving a crib must be done in moderation and is only advisable for structures at sharp angles to the ground. Uses A house is supported by box cribs while new foundation is being constructed as part of a house lifting process Cribbing is often performed as part of lifting/lowering operations. Expressions such as \\"lift an inch, crib an inch\\" and \\"pack as you jack\\" are used to remind operators of the importance of cribbing to secure and protect the load. The use of cribbing also allows for the use of a lifting device with a limited working range (such as a jack, lifting air bags or hydraulic rescue tools) as the load can be raised to the maximum range of the device, then lowered a short distance onto the cribbing, allowing another platform of cribbing to be built to raise the device and repeat the process. Cribbing can be used to secure a load following a building collapse, vehicular accident or other event where the regular stability of a structure or vehicle has been reduced. Cribbing is often used in the repair of heavy equipment or farm equipment. Subassemblies that have been disconnected are supported by cribbing until reassembly. In such work, cribbing is often safer than jack stands because it is less likely to tip over. And if the metal parts bite into the wood, this helps to keep sliding from happening. These factors are especially true in field repairs, because most ground is not perfectly level and hard, like a concrete garage floor would be. Even on concrete, cribbing is often preferred. In heavy industry, cribbing is a part of the rigger's trade. Cribbing is used when moving buildings in whole, or in part. Cribbing is used to raise the structure and allow the carrying vehicle to be positioned underneath, at which point the structure is then lowered onto the vehicle and the cribbing towers are removed. At the other end of the operation, the process is reversed, and the structure is lowered into its new position.

As President, Caama√±o Loquet develops, supervises and produces the financing/production company's feature film and television slate. In 2007, it was reported that the executive ranks had been expanded by the double hiring of Corrie Rothbart as Chief Financial Officer, and Rudy Scalese as Director of Development. Rothbart, whose previous roles included positions with ICM Partners, Gold Circle Films and Sony Pictures Entertainment, took on the role of overseer on \\"financial and strategic planning, corporate treasury, business development, production finance, accounting and operations.\\" Scalese's role new role was to \\"help identify and develop material to fulfill the company's production slate of four to five relatively big-budget films per year, as well as its lower-budget genre fare,\\" after he came to prominence producing the documentary: Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film. Scalese had also previously worked for Caama√±o-Loquet's D-No Entertainment.

Dan in Real Life (which Caama√±o-Loquet developed earlier with Noah Rosen and their D-No Entertainment) followed the same year, in association with Buena Vista. ThinkFilm released The Air I Breathe at various film festivals throughout late 2007, which then debuted in the United States on limited release in January 2008.

A winnowing barn consists of a large shed on tall posts with a hole in the floor. Raw, husked rice was carried up into the barn by slaves and then the grain was dropped through the hole. As the grain dropped to the ground, the lighter and undesirable chaff was carried away in the wind, leaving a mound of purified rice grains directly below the winnowing barn. The purified grain was then packed into barrels and carried down river to port cities for distribution. Prior to the development of the winnowing barn, winnowing was done by hand using winnowing baskets ‚Äî a long and labor-intensive process.

He would become the second representative of Albanian Orthodox population to become head of the Albanian government, after Pandeli Evangjeli. Kosturi was also among the contributors to the first Albanian teachers' school, the Shkolla Normale e Elbasanit, a teacher training institution that was founded on 1 December 1909 in Elbasan.  Life  Kosturi, son of Albanian patriot and activist Jovan Cico Kosturi was born in Kor√ß√´ in south-eastern Albania, back then Ottoman Empire, on 15 May 1873. Kosturi studied US and German history in Boston, MA, where he resided for several years. He became an American citizen. After his return home, being a polyglot and intellectual and having a patriotic family background, Kosturi joined the Albanian irredentist circles in the Manastir Vilayet. He was vice- chairman of the Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania based in Bitola. He was a member and bookkeeper of the \\"Dituria\\" (Knowledge) society founded in Kor√ß√´, and led by Orhan Pojani. After a visit (1902) to Bucharest, Kosturi told Albanians in Kor√ß√´ that the main concern of Dituria was to improve the Albanian boys school in the town through student attainment of higher grades, selecting better teachers and introducing new subjects. In 1909, he participated as representative of \\"Dituria\\" in the Congress of Elbasan, where it was decided the opening of Shkolla Normale e Elbasanit. In 1912, his name appears again as a member of the short-lived society \\"Shoq√´ria shkollore\\" (Scholastic society). He was a strong supporter of the Albanian Orthodox Church autocephaly, and the first Albanian church opened in Durr√´s in 1913. During the First World War he resided in Albania where he led his own cheta (guerrilla fighters) from 1914 to 1918. He continued the political involvement in the new Albanian state. In 1919, Kosturi was a delegate in the Congress of Durr√´s, following with hist participation in the Congress of Lushnje (1920). In 1920, he was elected Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. During the institutional crisis of 1921 in Albania, he served shortly as Prime Minister of Albania, replacing the short-lived government of Hasan Prishtina. Meanwhile, Kosturi had built reputation and financial stability as a successful merchant. In 1922, he signed the order for expulsion of Greek Bishop Iakovos (an opponent of Albanian Orthodox Autocephaly) from Kor√ß√´. He was a supporter of Fan Noli during the June Revolution of 1924. Kosturi was Deputy Prime Minister in Noli's government of 1924. After the suppression of June Revolution and rise in power of Ahmet Zogu, he went in exile and joined Noli's KONARE (Revolutionary National Committee). Kosturi returned into Albanian political life on 1 October 1943, as a representative of Kor√ß√´ region, and the same year was elected to lead the Commission for Mandate Verification, later Chairman of Constitutional Assembly of Albania on 25 October 1943. As a chairman, he declared as \\"void\\" all laws and legal act approved during 7 April 1939 and September 1943. Thus the \\"Personal unification\\" between Albania and Italy (established on 12 April 1939) came to an end. He declared the official Albanian neutrality in World War II. He was shot on 5 November 1943 in Durr√´s, right after leaving his home. The responsible party was the local Communist Guerrilla Unit. The action was carried out by a young communist, Kol√´ Laku. It is still unknown why Kosturi was pinpointed by the communists. When the future Albanian Prime Minister Rexhep Mitrovica was voted in the Parliament, he proposed the Assembly to declare National day of mourning. Kol√´ Laku became well known when he was arrested on 24 February 1944, and would be hanged. For his merits in Albanian political life and his state-forming and organizational contributions to Albania, Mihal Zallari (member of the Regency) directed that the square in front of the former Assembly of Albania building (area includes today's \\"Puppets' Theater\\", part of the Skanderbeg Square, and Socialist Party of Albania's premises) be renamed from \\"Costanzo Ciano\\" to \\"Idhomene Kosturi\\". With the rise of Communism in Albania, his patriotic, political, and financial contribution would get annihilated. He would be referred as \\"traitor\\" or even \\"Gestapo agent\\".

She lived in Toru≈Ñ, where she attended the Music School (\\"little conservatory\\"). There, she married Romuald Toczyski, a music teacher. She moved in 1968 with her family to Gda≈Ñsk in order to pursue her higher education. There she studied voice in the Higher Music School (the subsequent Academy of Music) in the class of Barbara Iglikowska, receiving her final diploma (with distinction) in 1973. But even before that, during studies, she was building her career by winning awards in international vocal competitions in Toulouse (1971), Paris (1972) and 's-Hertogenbosch (1973). Her debut occurred in 1973, on the stage of the Baltic State Opera House in Gda≈Ñsk, in the title role of Carmen, and her fame and prestige began accordingly. Initially, her activity was centered locally in Gda≈Ñsk, where she kept her position as the leading soloist in the Baltic State Opera, making also frequent guest visits to other opera houses. In 1975, the Baltic State Opera produced, especially for her, Samson et Dalila in 1975 (that same production seen also the next year in Warsaw), and La favorite by Donizetti in 1978 (also seen in Bremen the next year). Her first appearance outside of Poland took place in Basel, when she sang the role of Amneris in A√Øda, in 1977. Soon after, with her international career established, she gave a farewell performance in Gda≈Ñsk on 15 July 1979, as Dalila, no longer singing regularly for the Baltic State Opera, eventually moving out of Poland and establishing her permanent residency in Vienna, her career centered from now on at the Staatsoper. From there, she made frequent guest visits to sing on stages of various opera houses around the world, including her native country, particularly at the Teatr Wielki, Warsaw. On 16 September 1979 she made her American stage debut in the San Francisco Opera, as Laura in La GiocondaToczyska's San Francisco debut (with Renata Scotto and Luciano Pavarotti), which was telecast \\"live\\" around the world. She made her first appearance at Royal Opera House in 1983 (as Amneris in A√Øda), and also sang at the Teatro Col√≥n, in Buenos Aires. In 1988, Toczyska made her Metropolitan Opera debut, as Marfa in Mussourgsky's Khovanshchina.Khovanshchina in New YorkKhovanshchina in New York She went on to sing there in Aida, Il trovatore, La Gioconda, Boris Godunov (as Marina Mnichek), Un ballo in maschera (as Ulrica), Rusalka (as Jezibaba) and Adriana Lecouvreur (as the Principessa di Bouillon), with her last performance there, in 1997. Her discography includes recordings of Il trovatore (as Azucena, opposite Katia Ricciarelli, Jos√© Carreras and Yury Mazurok, conducted by Sir Colin Davis, 1980) and Prokofiev's War and Peace (with Galina Vishnevskaya, conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, 1986). She has also recorded the Polish songs by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, with Janusz Olejniczak. Toczyska's performance as Amneris in Aida at Los Angeles Opera was published on DVD. Her latest roles include King Roger (Warsaw, 2004), Salome (Herodias, Warsaw 2005), Haunted Manor (Czesnikova, Warsaw 2007), Prokofiev's The Gambler (as Babulenka, in Berlin, 2008)Berenboim in Berlin (note on Toczyska) and Mamma Lucia in Cavalleria rusticana (Paris 2012, Salzburg 2015).

He was of French-Canadian descent. Lorieau was born the youngest of 7 children on June 29, 1942Park Memorial Funeral Home, Edmonton, Alberta in Legal, Alberta to Henri and Alexandrine Lorieau. Both of his parents had musical backgrounds, his mother playing the violin, and his father a \\"natural tenor\\". Around 1981 Lorieau had sent in an audition tape in a search for a new anthem singer in Edmonton at the request of Oilers media relations director Bill Tuele. Although the anthem singer at the time had already been selected, the tape from Lorieau, which had been sent in late as he had been in New York City at the time, had been considered and he ultimately ended up being given the job. In response to the Canadian National Anthem being booed at the beginning of Game 5 of the 2006 NHL Western Conference Semifinals in San Jose, when playing the next game in Edmonton, the Canadian crowd responded in their own fashion. At the beginning of Game 3 between the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Oilers, he sang only a few lines of \\"O Canada\\" before letting the audience sing the rest of the song without him. This was done at all remaining Oilers home games throughout the rest of the 2006 playoffs, which included the Oilers appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, and even at the first few Oilers home games at the beginning of the 2006‚Äì07 NHL season. On March 23, 2011, Lorieau announced that he would retire at the end of the season. On April 8, 2011 when the Oilers played their final home game of the regular season, he performed in front of a sold-out Rexall Place one final time. A special pre-game ceremony was held to honour the Oilers longest-standing anthem singer and to give Oil Country a chance to salute Paul for 30 great years. Upon Lorieau's retirement, there was no official replacement for the Oilers' national anthem singer position until 2013, when Robert Clark was named as the singing voice of the Edmonton Oilers.Park singer performing for Oilers On July 2, 2013, Lorieau died in hospice of metastatic esophageal cancer, surrounded by his family.

It occurs in lowland moist forest and shrubland at elevation up to . It is sometimes treated as a distinct species, and sometimes as a subspecies of the red-legged tinamou. The SACC rejected a proposal to elevate it to species status, arguing that the presently available data fail to support the split. BirdLife International followed this treatment;Remsen, Jr. J. V. (2008) hence the Colombian tinamou has been dropped from the 2007 IUCN Red List.BirdLife International (2007) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Description The Colombian tinamou is approximately in length. It is a medium-sized brownish tinamou. It has a plain brown crown and white throat. Its upper parts are also plain brown with no barring, white notches in the secondaries and wing coverts. Its underparts are paler brown with dark barring near vent. The legs are pinkish-red in color. The Colombian tinamou looks very similar to the red-legged tinamou (Crypturellus erythropus), however the Colombian tinamou is darker and has stronger barring. Status and conservation It is threatened by deforestation of the lowlands forests in its range. In recent years, there has been a very rapid loss of habitat in the northern part of the Cordillera Central and the Serran√≠a de San Lucas, where the remaining populations are concentrated. It was uplisted to Endangered (EN A2c+3c) by the IUCN in 2004, after being assessed as Near Threatened since 1988, but as mentioned above it is no longer included in the Red List, where instead considered a subspecies of the red-legged tinamou. Currently no conservation measures are known. It has been proposed to survey to determine its precise distribution and ecological requirements, and find suitable habitat to protect these birds.

This profession of faith cannot have been presented to the Exarch of Ravenna at any time after the papacy revolted - soon after 727 (see Eutychius (exarch)) - against the Emperor. The Exarchate itself was finally extinguished in 752. The profession of faith in the Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum is addressed to Saint Peter in a form somewhat reminiscent of an oath. However, the book nowhere calls it an oath. Ambiguous expressions in some anti-Catholic writings could lead incautious readers to suppose that the text in the Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum was used by all newly elected Popes until the eleventh century and that it had been in use since the fifth century. An example is William Webster's An Ecumenical Council Officially Condemns a Pope for Heresy: :In the Liber Diurnus the Formulary of the Roman Chancery (from the fifth to the eleventh century), there is found the old formula for the papal oath...according to which every new Pope, on entering upon his office, had to swear that \\"he recognised the sixth Ecumenical Council, which smote with eternal anathema the originators of the heresy (Monotheletism), Sergius, Pyrrhus, etc., together with Honorius\\" (Charles Joseph Hefele, A History of the Councils of the Church (Edinburgh: Clark, 1896), Volume V, pp. 181-187). However, Webster does not expressly state that the formula in the Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum was used by Popes from the fifth to the eleventh century, which would obviously be impossible. The Liber Diurnus formula speaks of the Third Council of Constantinople as recently held and mentions by name the Pope and the Emperor involved in the Council. Popes outside the 682-727 period would not have spoken of the 680-681 Council as recent, and it would be particularly ridiculous to suppose that Popes from two centuries before the Council knew anything whatever about that Council.

Daken was created by writer Daniel Way and artist Steve Dillon and first appeared in Wolverine: Origins #10 (March 2007). Daken is the mutant son of Wolverine and the deceased Itsu. He possesses superhuman abilities similar to his father (e.g., healing factor, retractable claws), and was a member of the Dark Avengers under the name Wolverine and later becomes a member of X-Factor. Daken was ranked sixth in Comics Alliance's \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\" list and is often recognized for his sex appeal. Publication history =Creation and Wolverine: Origins= Daken first appeared in Wolverine: Origins #10 (March 2007), created by writer Daniel Way and artist Steve Dillon. Regarding Daken's role in Wolverine: Origins and his relationship with his father, Way stated that whereas Logan is attempting to \\"take control of his destiny\\", Daken is heading down the opposite direction, \\"hacking, slashing and going nuts\\". He also stated that what Daken needs in his life is guidance, something that Logan is struggling to offer him. But in order to achieve that they first must kill Romulus. Additionally, Way revealed that Daken's role would increase in 2009 and that by the end of Wolverine: Origins, his past would intentionally remain open to provide a \\"fertile ground for years ... worth of stories\\". =Dark Avengers= Following the conclusion of his story arc in Wolverine: Origins and the events of Dark Reign, Daken became a member of Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers and took up the mantle Wolverine in Dark Avengers #1 (March 2009). Regarding his use of Daken on the team and the character's motivation for joining the Dark Avengers, Brian Michael Bendis said: > Daken is one of the best things to come out of Origins, and what better way > to piss off his father? He's an iconic and legacy character attached to a > number of cool things in the Marvel Universe, but he really hasn't had a lot > of face time with it. So we can really roll up our sleeves and see what > we've got there and help create a character. I'm not taking anything away > from Daniel Way, his creator, but I am saying once a character gets rolling > it's interesting to see him interacting with different types of characters. > You take him out of the Wolverine book to see what he's made of. It's much > like with Wolverine, when you took him out of 'Hulk' [where he first > appeared], he became something else. During the Utopia crossover-event that lasted from June to September 2009, Osborn also assigned Daken as a member of the Dark X-Men. Matt Fraction, who wrote Daken in Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia described Daken as erudite, cultured and flamboyant and as \\"the metrosexual Wolverine\\". Similarly to Bendis, Fraction stated that Daken's reasons for joining the Dark X-Men is both because he loves the attention and because it makes \\"his dad's blood boil\\". Daken remained a member of Osborn's team until Dark Avengers #16 (July 2010), where he managed to avoid capture. =Dark Wolverine and characterization= Writer Marjorie Liu autographing a copy of the Daken/X-23: Collision trade paperback at a signing at Midtown Comics in Manhattan In conjunction to his role on Dark Avengers, Daken also took over the starring role in the fourth volume of Wolverine starting with issue 75 (August 2009), where it was retitled to Dark Wolverine. The series was co-written by Way and Marjorie Liu. Liu, who hadn't written Daken before, decided to work on the series after being asked by Way due to Daken being \\"slightly psychotic, highly intelligent, very manipulative and ha[ving] daddy issues\\", traits which she found interesting to work with as a writer. Way stated that while the Dark Avengers appear as supporting characters in the series, Dark Wolverine is about what Daken does while away from the team. He further described Dark Avengers as Daken's grand entry into the Marvel Universe and that while him joining the Avengers wasn't part of his original plan for the character, he feels that it fits with his initial plans of having Daken \\"get out into the world\\" and encounter other characters. Regarding the character's personal reasons for joining the team, Way stated that it allows Daken to pervert and destroy the legacy built by his father. Regarding Daken's characterization, Liu described him as someone who is confident in his own abilities and superiority, despite never having actually tested them \\"on the world stage\\". But since taking up the mantle of Wolverine means being in the public eye, he gets to \\"live a little and spread his wings [and] face the fact that there are people just a bit better at the game than him\\". Way stated that Daken's goal is to not simply kill Romulus for the role he played in his mother's death but also to become the new Romulus. On whether Daken joining the Dark Avengers means he's being redeemed or not, Liu stated that in order for someone to want to achieve redemption, they first need to believe they've committed an act that requires atonement, and Daken doesn't feel any guilt for his past actions. She also described him as elegant, preferring to use his brains over his brawn. She further stated that Daken is unable to form meaningful relationships, with the ones he does form being based on how he can use the people around him. His father is the one exception, who manages to \\"ruffle his emotions\\". =All-New Wolverine and Iceman= Following the events of \\"Secret Wars\\", Daken made his first appearance in All-New Wolverine #25. =Sexual orientation= Daken has been portrayed as bisexual, having engaged in sexual situations with both men and women. Daken kissed a man in Wolverine: Origins #11; however the encounter also served to further toy with a woman he had been romantically seeing and later, Daken killed the man in question. In Dark Wolverine #75 it is vaguely suggested Daken has had a sexual encounter with a male employee of Norman Osborn, but this was also shown as a means to access top-secret files. Later in the same issue, Daken makes a pass at Mac Gargan however the context is ambiguous, possibly facetious. In the same issue, Daken uses his pheromones to \\"engage\\" a female H.A.M.M.E.R. agent. In Dark Avengers #7, Daken humorously states how he \\"...always did like playing for both teams\\", a double entendre referencing bisexuality and his membership in both the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men.Dark X-Men #7. Marvel Comics. In Dark Wolverine #76, Daken uses his pheromones in order to manipulate the Thing, goading him with homoerotic remarks.Dark Wolverine #76. Marvel Comics. During the Siege of Asgard, Daken also made a flirtatious pass at Bullseye dressed as Hawkeye,Dark Wolverine #82. Marvel Comics. and kisses him on-panel.Dark Wolverine #84. Marvel Comics. In Dark Reign: Young Avengers #5, Daken attempts to uses his pheromones during a fight against Hulkling, a gay male superhero.Young Avengers #5. Marvel Comics. Daken has also been shown on numerous occasions engaging in heterosexual behavior and sleeping with female characters. At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, Marjorie Liu, commenting on Daken's sexuality, stated that \\"[Daken] will do anyone and anything [to achieve his goals] and he's past that kind of identification. He's beyond it\\". Daniel Way added that Daken's sexuality will be addressed later on, but it's more about his personality. \\"He's no more homosexual than he is heterosexual. It's about control\\". Liu later confirmed Daken's bisexuality in a 2011 video interview with Newsarama.

Daken: Dark Wolverine # 1 (September 2010). Marvel Comics. After Itsu's death, a mysterious man cuts baby Daken from his mother's womb, leaving her body lying on the floor. Daken survives this incident due to his mutant healing factor.Wolverine: Origins #6. Marvel Comics. Sometime in the year 1946, Daken is placed at the doorstep of Akihira and Natsumi, a wealthy young and traditional Japanese couple. They take his presence as an answer to their prayers and raise him as their own. Though he is named Akihiro by his father, the servants and other families of the province secretly refer to him as Daken (, \\"bastard dog\\" or \\"mongrel\\"), a slur on his obvious mixed heritage. As Akihiro grows, he is often teased by the other boys of the village. His harsh treatment over the years causes Akihiro to develop a very cold personality, directed at everyone except his father. One night, Natsumi confesses to Akihira that she does not love their adopted son and that, after long years of trying, she is pregnant. Akihiro overhears the talk and begins plotting. Within a year, after the birth of the baby, Akihiro confronts his mother and tells her that he has killed her son. Upon learning this, Akihira is furious and disowns Akihiro, who angrily responds that \\"Akihiro\\" is not his true name anyway. Natsumi suddenly appears and tries to run him through, triggering the unsheathing of his mutant claws. He waves his arm, accidentally slashing Natsumi. Akihira, unable to force himself to harm his son, commits suicide. Romulus then appears to the boy for the first time and tells him that he is what the boy will someday become.Wolverine: Origins #26 (Aug. 2008). Marvel Comics. Daken is trained harshly, including nannies who show motherlike love to him before trying to kill him, forcing Daken to kill them (\\"After the third one I stopped falling for it\\", he says). In the present, Daken disguises himself as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and infiltrates a facility where his father is imprisoned. He stabs Dum Dum Dugan and confronts his father for the first time. He slashes Logan across the stomach and leaves him to bleed on the floor, just as his mother was left many years before.Wolverine: Origins #10. Marvel Comics. Daken is revealed to have \\"aided\\" his father's escape, though not for benevolent reasons. He is next seen in Berlin at the home of a woman with whom he has been cruelly, and romantically, toying. He allowed her to witness him kissing another man on a date, although unbeknownst to her, he later murdered the man to acquire a passport. Knowing that she would drink an entire bottle of burgundy, he secretly poisons it, resulting in her death, so that no loose ends are left to tie him to his crimes. While still in Germany, Daken is contacted by an anonymous messenger who reminds him of his displeased master's \\"ultimate goal\\". Daken then dispatches the messenger to again make sure no trace of his presence is left. Later he appears on a train to Brussels, watching his father in a nearby stolen car. He then receives a phone call from an unknown \\"friend\\" (who is actually the resurrected Cyber), confirming his father's destination.Wolverine: Origins #12. Marvel Comics. Shadowing his father into a bank vault in Brussels that contains the carbonadium synthesizer, Daken engages Wolverine in a bloody battle with Daken demonstrating great fighting prowess and similar speed and agility to his father. As Wolverine is hampered by his lack of desire to kill his son and his fading belief that Daken can be redeemed, he quickly loses the upper hand despite his greater experience and training. Their fight is interrupted when Cyber breaks into the vault and challenges Daken.Wolverine: Origins #13. Marvel Comics. It is then revealed that Daken trained under Cyber in the past. Cyber mentions that Daken is a better and faster fighter than he is, and was his finest student. However, Cyber's imperviousness and greater strength make that a moot point, as he later explains to Wolverine. Daken refuses to lead Cyber to his master and flees the fight, leaving his father and his mentor to deal with each other.Wolverine: Origins #14. Marvel Comics. Daken is then seen in the presence of Wild Child, and a scarred, expressionless torturer who whips him with a gasoline soaked length of rope. He pleads for mercy, but receives only a warning from his \\"master\\" to stay away from his father.Wolverine: Origins #15. Marvel Comics. Daken returns and fights Deadpool and Wolverine, managing to knock Deadpool unconscious after a long fight. Daken had spent the last couple of months being tortured under observation by Wild Child, who is acting on orders from their mutual master, Romulus.Wolverine: Origins #21. Marvel Comics. Daken is then confronted by Wolverine, only to be shot in the back of the head by Winter Soldier. Wolverine explains that he set up the entire scenario and leaves with the unconscious Daken, later revealed to have amnesia due to the bullet. During the 2008 storyline \\"Manifest Destiny\\", Daken is tracked down by Sebastian Shaw and Mister Sinister to help Daken regain his memories.

Daken promised himself that he would not take the drug before the heist, but decides to take it anyway. Immediately after the drug is taken, he begins to hallucinate very heavily during the heist. Seven days earlier, Daken is at a party in Hollywood with actors, directors, musicians, agents, executives, and beautiful women. Despite the lavish ambiance, Daken is extremely bored with the Hollywood facade. Daken's true motive for being at the party is to find a lead to who secretly controls Hollywood so he can take over. He was under the impression that Los Angeles was wide open due to \\"The Pride\\" losing control of the city. Daken was told by his fixer that the owner of the house and host of the party Marcus Roston, who also happens to be on Hollywood's A-List, has information as to who is pulling the strings in Hollywood. As Daken attempts to enter Roston's section, he is blocked by two bodyguards. Daken attempts to talk with one of them saying that he has a big deal. He is immediately disparaged by one of the guards. This causes Daken to attack him and break his nose. Immediately Daken is feeling the effects of the drug \\"Heat\\" and is disoriented even though his healing factor should have stopped it. He is knocked unconscious by the other bodyguard. In an undisclosed part of Los Angeles, there is an up-and-coming actor who is being chased by some kind of serial killer. The actor is murdered during the night. The next day, the LAPD is investigating the crime scene. Two detectives are making jokes when one of them warns the other of \\"Narnia\\" approaching the scene. This happens to be F.B.I. agent Donna Kiel.

Daken regains consciousness in front of the two bodyguards and Marcus Roston himself. Daken is surprised about the pills. Marcus confirms that he knows about them. He also berates Daken, stating that he is not a big deal due to the fact that he does not know him. As he threatens him, Daken dispatches his guards. Marcus attempts to bargain with Daken. Daken tells him that he not only wants money, but he also wants power and validation. Marcus pleads with him, saying that he will do anything for his life to be spared.

F.B.I. agent Donna Kiel confirms the identity of the victim of the serial killer, making a snide remark about one less actor in Hollywood. The victim was killed by wounds caused by claws. She walks back to her office and it shows numerous pictures of Daken on her wall, indicating that Daken is considered a prime suspect for the serial killings. Six days earlier, Daken and Marcus are watching a final cut from an upcoming movie that Marcus is starring in. Daken tells him that he feels the movie is simplistic. Marcus explains to Daken that the audience loves things that are simple. He does wish to do an indie film which is more personal, but he has to strike while his fame is on the rise as a leading man in movies. Daken insults Marcus by suggesting that he should be a queen. Marcus replies that if he comes \\"out of the closet\\" his acting career will suffer, and he says that if Daken cannot understand that, he does not understand the movie business. Daken shows his claws and threatens Marcus to tell him his dealer of the \\"heat pills\\". Marcus asks Daken why he loves the pills so much. Daken goes into a narration to the reader about the pills. As Daken is narrating, there are scenes of him in a state of euphoria as he meets up with Marcus's dealer, and shoots him twice in the thighs. The dealer gives up his supplier as Daken cuts him with his claws. Daken also states the supplier psychically told him the location of where the Los Angeles crime bosses are holding a secret meeting. Daken then goes to the nightclub where the dealer's supplier is enjoying a night out, and the situation worsens, but Daken does not care, because he loves the euphoria of the \\"heat pills\\". During an investigation, Daken has a confrontation with the hero Moon Knight before he can discover the identity of the mysterious kingpin of Los Angeles. A beaten up and broken Daken discovers the properties of the heat pills are from non-human blood, confirming his suspicions that the blood belongs to a member of the Pride. An angry Daken wonders how to kill a member of the Pride but realizes he does not know, so he seeks out the people who do - their children, the Runaways. The Runaways, however, do not take lightly to his appearance and immediately attack him.Daken: Dark Wolverine #17. Marvel Comics. Daken manages to talk them down, and reveals that he believes Roston to be an exiled member of The Pride.

Daken, attempting to make a joke, is stopped by a distressed and perturbed Donna. Donna forces Daken to admit why they are meeting, but Daken does not. An impatient Donna states to him that they were meeting up to find out if they are going to fall in love. Donna then calls him a coward, and a scared little boy due to him not saying this. Those comments anger Daken to the point of grabbing Donna and popping out his claws. Donna states that she was not part of the super hero, mutant, and clone club, and offered Daken a chance to admit who he truly is. She tells him that she is smart and Daken cannot hide himself from her. She says she does not want to be a clich√© and wants to be real. Daken and Donna the share a long passionate kiss, before Donna stops the embrace. Daken questions why, and she tells him that he is a murderer, cop killer, and a monster. Daken laughs hysterically and then is smacked. Daken admits that this is who he is and has no compunctions regarding murder and sleeps well at night. Donna screams at him saying that he was not capable of feeling love, and just because they were both tortured by Roston and shared an addiction does not mean they should be together. She questions how she could ever fall in love with a man like that. Daken replies that she is the same as him. She denies this, saying that she has never killed anyone. Daken insists that Donna comes with him, so he can help her. He takes her to an underground basement. To Donna's surprise, she sees three men that are tied up and look like they have been tortured. Donna states that she is F.B.I. and that he is out of his mind. Daken says that she rationalizes her psychotic tendencies by catching other psychopaths. He gives her a gun and attempts to convince her to pull the trigger so she can release her repressed emotions and be free. Donna admits to Daken that this is true. Daken does achieve this goal, but not to the desired effect, as she points the gun towards Daken. She knows his healing factor is gone, and he can be killed. Before she can arrest him, Daken cuts off her hand in defense. Daken, in disbelief, asks her why she would do that. She replies that the world is better off without him. Daken covers her wound saying that she does not mean that, because she came back to save him and no one has ever done that for him. She says that she did not come back for him, but she was trying to stop a monster. Daken, in disbelief, turns and walks away after being rejected. As he enters the elevator, he makes a final attempt to gain her love by saying that he will change. She simply responds with \\"No you won't\\".

Powers and abilities Daken has inherited a potential of mutant abilities from his father, although he possesses certain powers Wolverine does not have. Daken's primary mutant power is a rapid healing factor that allows him to rapidly heal damaged or destroyed parts of his body faster and more extensively than a normal human. As an example of his effective healing factor, Daken once instantly healed from a serious beating from the Thing, recovered from a massive explosive inflicted by the Punisher, and regenerated a lost arm he suffered from Mister Sinister. His healing factor also is powerful enough to significantly enhance his natural physical abilities, augment his immunity to poisons or diseases, and increase his longevity. However, Daken's healing factor is different from his father. While Wolverine heals in an automated nature, Daken heals in cognitive fashion, through sentient thought and emotional control. It was revealed in All-New Wolverine 28#, Muramasa claimed that Daken's guilt of not preventing his father's death is what slowed down his healing factor. Inner meditation was required for Daken to become whole, such as regenerating a missing arm. Like his father, Daken possesses three retractable claws, contained within his forearms; two on the top of knuckles and one underneath his wrist. These claws are much tougher and thicker than normal human bone, sharp and strong enough to easily cuts through durable metals that is equivalent to the likes of Iron Man's armor. Daken has animal-like senses of sight, hearing, smell at superhuman level. These senses make him a dangerous tracker or hunter, which Daken can use/uses to detect people or objects by scent alone, track a target despite its scent being greatly attenuated by time or weather, and detect anyone lying. Daken has the ability to manipulate the pheromones of others. With complete control over the pheromones, Daken can uses his powers to manipulate a target's emotions and senses, allowing him to alter them, hinder their depth awareness and visual insight, causing them to act sluggishly or slowly. His powers also granted him empathic ability, allowing him to sense and understand the emotions, feelings, or intentions of people and animals around him. Daken has a powerful mental defense to telepathy, for his mind is a trap for telepaths that attempt to enter his head. The trap turns a skilled telepathy's powers against them. After being resurrected by the Apocalypse Twins, who use the Death Seed to turn him into a Horsemen of Death, Daken had been granted with the power and potential to become the new repetition of Apocalypse on Earth. In Iceman 9#, a new mutant named Zachary unintentionally helps Daken access the Death Seed's powers, which significantly amplified Daken's abilities. Daken is a superb martial artist and hand-to-hand combatant, acknowledged by his former instructor, Cyber. His combat prowess was demonstrated when he bested Wolverine, Deadpool, Skaar, Punisher, and Sabretooth in combat. Combined with his ability to manipulate pheromones, this grants Daken an incredible advantage over his opponents in combat. Daken is also a trained Samurai, acquiring great skill in both Japanese swordsmanship arts and Ky≈´d≈ç. Daken is a master strategist and tactician, as seen when he was able to infiltrate a heavily-guarded S.H.I.E.L.D. base to free his father without getting caught. He's also a master manipulator and deceiver, capable of fooling two of the most intelligent men, Norman Osborn and Reed Richards, at the same time. Alternate versions In What If? Wolverine: Father #1, Logan was present when Daken was born and was able to save him from the people who would have raised him in the original course of events, taking him to live in seclusion in the mountains in the hope that he could raise John Howlett (as Daken is known in this timeline) away from the kind of life he has lived himself. However, despite his attempts to ensure privacy by turning Professor X away when he came to recruit Logan to join the X-Men, Logan's attempts to suppress Daken's darker instincts failed when Sabretooth found them, revealing the truth about his father's past to John. Leaving his father, John became a brutal killer, roaming various cities and killing his opponents, proclaiming that Logan made him what he is by denying him his heritage. Concluding that he will never bring anything good into the world, Logan stabs John in the heart with the Muramasa Blade, subsequently impaling himself to end his own dark stain on the world.What If?

It is the second highway in Ontario to be designated Highway 634, with the original Highway 634 being near Sudbury. The current routing was at first designated as Highway 807, but was renumbered in 1977. The road was re- aligned around the eastern part of Smooth Rock Falls in the mid-1990s. As of 2019, the entire route is paved. Services along the route are only available within Smooth Rock Falls. Two additional communities exist along Highway 634: Brownrigg and Fraserdale.  Route description  Highway 634 is an isolated bush highway that connects Highway 11 in the community of Smooth Rock Falls with the Abitibi Canyon hydroelectric dam. The road is in length. Like most other two-lane roads in Ontario, the speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) although there are sections where such cannot be maintained. As of 2019, the entire route is paved. The route passes through the communities of Brownrigg along its otherwise isolated route through the Canadian Shield within thick Boreal Forest. At Fraserdale, drivers must turn northeast to reach the Abitibi Canyon Generating Station. Highway 634 ends at the western edge of the dam; the locally maintained Otter Rapids Road continues west of there. A forest road also travels west from Fraserdale to the community of Smokey Falls. Like other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 634 is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 2010, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry along a lone section of the route showed that on average, 120 vehicles used the highway daily between the northern outskirts of Smooth Rock Falls and Fraserdale.  History  The Highway 634 designation has existed along two routes. The original designation connected Highway 144‚Äîthen designated Highway 544‚Äîin Chelmsford with Highway 69 in Val Caron, entirely within what is now Greater Sudbury.

He has been a Liberal Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council since 2015. He was formerly a councillor of the City of South Sydney from 2000 to 2004, and of the City of Sydney from 2004 to 2012.  Political background and Council career  2012 by-election for the NSW seat of Sydney Mallard was President of the New South Wales branch of the Young Liberals from 1993 to 1994, succeeding John Brogden, who later became leader of the NSW Liberal Party and NSW Leader of the Opposition. Prior to election to the City of Sydney Council in March 2004, Mallard served as a councillor on the South Sydney City Council, from July 2000. In 2004, both Councils were amalgamated. Mallard is the first Liberal endorsed candidate elected to the City of Sydney. In 2008, Mallard ran against sitting candidate Clover Moore for the popularly elected position of Lord Mayor, gaining 14% of the vote. Moore was re-elected. Mallard was instrumental in setting up the City's register of same-sex relationships. Mallard has long been supportive of marriage equality, putting him in opposition to many party members, including the former Federal Leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott but putting him in support with the former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. In 2009, Mallard faced two accusations of misconduct and for breaching Council's code of conduct. The first alleged indiscretion related to debating and voting on a development application before Council from the hotelier George Thomas who had allegedly made a donation to support Mallard's re-election to Council. Using parliamentary privilege, Lee Rhiannon, a Greens Member of NSW Legislative Council, accused Mallard of a second indiscretion by receiving illegal donations through provision of rent by a third party during the 2008 local government election campaign. Mallard asked the matters be referred to the NSW Department of Local Government for investigation. The Department of Local Government investigation cleared Mallard of allegations that he breached the Council's code of conduct. Following an earlier announcement that he would again run against Moore for the popularly elected position of Lord Mayor, in June 2012 Mallard announced that he would not contest the 2012 local government elections. In September 2012, Mallard was endorsed as the Liberal Party candidate for the NSW Legislative Assembly seat of Sydney at the 2012 by-election but was beaten by Moore-backed independent candidate Alex Greenwich. New South Wales parliamentary career Mallard was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council on the Liberal/Nationals ticket at the 2015 state election, endorsed as the seventh candidate. Mallard was involved in calling on the government to protect the Radiata Plateau in the Blue Mountains.https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/blue-mountains- radiata-plateau-bought-by-nsw-government-20191007-p52yer.html  Personal  Mallard's early career was in marketing and advertising. In 1995 he took a career sabbatical and established a small business in horticulture with his brother in the inner city suburb of Darlinghurst. Mallard, who is gay, is in a same-sex relationship with Danish born Jesper Hansen. On 20 July 2012 it was reported that they would marry in a Lutheran Church in Copenhagen in 2013.

In the USSR, it was published in 1987, in the Latvian magazine Daugava, with the title \\"The Time of Rains\\" (). Initially, the novel was written in 1966-1967 to be published in the Soviet literary magazine Molodaya Gvardiya, but the publication was rejected by censor due to prominent political and free-thought overtones in the novel. It circulated in samizdat, and in 1972 was published without the authors' permission abroad, in the Federal Republic of Germany. In 2006, a loose film adaptation of the novel was made by Konstantin Lopushansky.  Plot summary  The action takes place in an uncertain mildly-authoritarian country, in an unnamed town. Famous writer Victor Banev, a middle-aged heavy drinker, comes from the capital city to the town of his childhood where the rain never stops. Banev finds himself in the middle of strange events linked to slimies or four-eyes - strange leper people suffering from disfiguring \\"yellow leprosy\\" manifesting itself as yellow circles around the eyes. These slimies live in a former leper colony. The town's adult population is terrified by their existence, considering them to be the cause of all the bad and odd things in the town. Nevertheless, the town's teenagers simply adore slimies, that including Banev's daughter Irma. A boy named Bol-Kunats, Irma's friend, invites the writer to a meeting with the town school's students. Banev is deeply shocked by teenagers' high intelligence and disullusioned point of view. They appear as superhuman geniuses despising the dirty and corrupt human world and having no pity for the adults. Banev makes acquaintance with Diana, and discusses slimies in dinner conversations with the chief doctor of the leprosarium Yul Golem, a drunken artist Ram Quadriga and sanitary inspector Pavor Summan. Banev dislikes the mayor, a patron of local fascist thugs, and also the military who guard the slimies. Golem mentions that the genetic disease of slimies represents the future of humanity, a new genetic type of people, intellectually and morally superior to ordinary people. Events begin to unfold dramatically. Banev discovers that Pavor Summan works for counterintelligence, and, learning he's guilty of kidnapping and killing of a slimy, notifies the military out of spite. The town's children leave their parents' homes and move into the leper colony. Adults of the town are gripped with a sudden overpowering feeling of terror, and exodus begins. As soon as all the residents have left town, the rain stops. Golem leaves the last. Banev and Diana enter the city, now disappearing under the rays of Sun. They see Irma and Bol-Kunats all grown up in a day and happy, and Banev's saying to himself: \\"All this is nice and fine, but I mustn't forget to return.\\" Shared ideas The novel shares some ideas with later works like The Second Invasion from Mars, Roadside Picnic (a non-standard alien invasion), and The Time Wanderers. Cultural references * The prototype of Victor Banev is, according to Boris Strugatsky, \\"a generalized image of the Bard.\\" Among those included in this image, Strugatsky named Alexander Galich, Yuliy Kim, Bulat Okudzhava and Vladimir Vysotsky.

In metabolic acidosis, chemoreceptors sense a deranged acid-base balance with a plasma pH of lesser than normal (<7.4). The chemoreceptors send afferent fibers to the brainstem respiratory centers.

Most of the carbonic acid then dissociates to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. The bicarbonate buffer system is an acid-base homeostatic mechanism involving the balance of carbonic acid (H2CO3), bicarbonate ion (HCO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in order to maintain pH in the blood and duodenum, among other tissues, to support proper metabolic function. Catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, carbon dioxide (CO2) reacts with water (H2O) to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which in turn rapidly dissociates to form a bicarbonate ion (HCO ) and a hydrogen ion (H+) as shown in the following reaction: \\\\rm CO_2 + H_2O \\\\rightleftarrows H_2CO_3 \\\\rightleftarrows HCO_3^- + H^+ As with any buffer system, the pH is balanced by the presence of both a weak acid (for example, H2CO3) and its conjugate base (for example, HCO) so that any excess acid or base introduced to the system is neutralized. Failure of this system to function properly results in acid-base imbalance, such as acidemia (pH<7.35) and alkalemia (pH>7.45) in the blood. In systemic acid‚Äìbase balance In tissue, cellular respiration produces carbon dioxide as a waste product; as one of the primary roles of the cardiovascular system, most of this CO2 is rapidly removed from the tissues by its hydration to bicarbonate ion. The bicarbonate ion present in the blood plasma is transported to the lungs, where it is dehydrated back into CO2 and released during exhalation. These hydration and dehydration conversions of CO2 and H2CO3, which are normally very slow, are facilitated by carbonic anhydrase in both the blood and duodenum. While in the blood, bicarbonate ion serves to neutralize acid introduced to the blood through other metabolic processes (e.g. lactic acid, ketone bodies); likewise, any bases (e.g. urea from the catabolism of proteins) are neutralized by carbonic acid (H2CO3). =Regulation= As calculated by the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation, in order to maintain a normal pH of 7.4 in the blood (whereby the pKa of carbonic acid is 6.1 at physiological temperature), a 20:1 bicarbonate to carbonic acid must constantly be maintained; this homeostasis is mainly mediated by pH sensors in the medulla oblongata of the brain and probably in the kidneys, linked via negative feedback loops to effectors in the respiratory and renal systems. In the blood of most animals, the bicarbonate buffer system is coupled to the lungs via respiratory compensation, the process by which the rate and/or depth of breathing changes to compensate for changes in the blood concentration of CO2. By Le Chatelier's principle, the release of CO2 from the lungs pushes the reaction above to the left, causing carbonic anhydrase to form CO2 until all excess acid is removed. Bicarbonate concentration is also further regulated by renal compensation, the process by which the kidneys regulate the concentration of bicarbonate ions by secreting H+ ions into the urine while, at the same time, reabsorbing HCO ions into the blood plasma, or vice versa, depending on whether the plasma pH is falling or rising, respectively. =Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation= A modified version of the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation can be used to relate the pH of blood to constituents of the bicarbonate buffer system:page 556, section \\"Estimating plasma pH\\" in: : \\\\ce{pH} = \\\\textrm{p}K_{a~\\\\ce{H_2CO_3}}+ \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{[\\\\ce{HCO_3^-}]}{[\\\\ce{H_2CO_3}]} \\\\right ), where: *pKa H2CO3 is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the acid dissociation constant of carbonic acid. It is equal to 6.1. *[HCO] is the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood *[H2CO3] is the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood When describing arterial blood gas, the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation is usually quoted in terms of pCO2, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, rather than H2CO3. However, these quantities are related by the equation: : [\\\\ce{H_2CO_3}] = k_{\\\\ce{H~CO_2}} \\\\times p_\\\\ce{CO_2}, where: *[H2CO3] is the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood *kH CO2 is a constant including the solubility of carbon dioxide in blood. kH CO2 is approximately 0.03 (mmol/L)/mmHg *pCO2 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood Taken together, the following equation can be used to relate the pH of blood to the concentration of bicarbonate and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide: : \\\\ce{pH} = 6.1 + \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{[\\\\ce{HCO_3^-}]}{0.0307 \\\\times p_\\\\ce{CO_2}} \\\\right ), where: *pH is the acidity in the blood *[HCO] is the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood, in mmol/L *pCO2 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood, in mmHg =Derivation of the Kassirer‚ÄìBleich approximation= The Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation, which is derived from the law of mass action, can be modified with respect to the bicarbonate buffer system to yield a simpler equation that provides a quick approximation of the H+ or HCO concentration without the need to calculate logarithms: K_{a,\\\\ce{H_2CO_3}} = \\\\frac{[\\\\ce{HCO_3^-}][\\\\ce{H_3O^+}]}{[\\\\ce{H_2CO_3}]} Since the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is much easier to obtain from measurement than carbonic acid, the Henry's law solubility constant ‚Äì which relates the partial pressure of a gas to its solubility ‚Äì for CO2 in plasma is used in lieu of the carbonic acid concentration. After rearranging the equation and applying Henry's law, the equation becomes: [\\\\ce{H^+}] = \\\\frac{K'\\\\cdot0.03p_{\\\\ce{CO_2}}}{[\\\\ce{HCO_3^-}]}, where K‚Äô is the dissociation constant from the pKa of carbonic acid, 6.1, which is equal to 800nmol/L (since K‚Äô = 10‚àípKa = 10‚àí(6.1) ‚âà 8.00X10‚àí07mol/L = 800nmol/L). By multiplying K‚Äô (expressed as nmol/L) and 0.03 (800 X 0.03 = 24) and rearranging with respect to HCO, the equation is simplified to: [\\\\ce{HCO_3^-}] = 24\\\\frac{p_{\\\\ce{CO_2}}}{[\\\\ce{H^+}]} In other tissues The bicarbonate buffer system plays a vital role in other tissues as well. In the human stomach and duodenum, the bicarbonate buffer system serves to both neutralize gastric acid and stabilize the intracellular pH of epithelial cells via the secretion of bicarbonate ion into the gastric mucosa. In patients with duodenal ulcers, Helicobacter pylori eradication can restore mucosal bicarbonate secretion, and reduce the risk of ulcer recurrence.

He was an advocate for several heritage buildings (see below), and played key roles in the Wellington Architectural Centre's projects on Wellington's urban form, namely: \\"Te Aro Replanned\\" (1947), \\"Homes Without Sprawl\\" (1957), \\"City Approaches\\" (1959) and \\"Wgtn 196X\\" (1961).Gatley. \\"The Wellington CBD Replanned: Wgtn 196X.\\" pp. 17-25. Toomath also presented professional evidence for the Wellington City Council on proposals for controlling building heights, protected viewshafts and urban form planning (1989‚Äì1990) in hearings before the Planning Tribunal. Toomath led a small team whose report on the Old Town Hall stopped moves for its demolition.\\"Wellington Town Hall\\" pp. 1-20. He wrote papers on conservation matters and presented evidence in support of a number of heritage buildings including: the AMP Head Office Building, the State Fire Insurance Building, Wharf Sheds 7 and 21. He had an active role in campaigns to save Old St Paul's. Design educator Toomath was also the Head of the School of Design, Wellington Polytechnic (1979‚Äì1989), and a contributor of articles to the New Zealand journal Designscape. He was a regular participant of the \\"Designmark\\" Advisory Panels, New Zealand Industrial Design Council from 1969, and a Judge of the Prince Philip Award for New Zealand Industrial Design (1981‚Äì1985). Documentary Toomath is the subject of a documentary Antonello and the Architect, which reveals his influences, designs, ideas - and the painting that he built - Antonello da Messina's St Jerome in his Study.

The church is located at Yishun Street 22. History The church had its humble beginnings in the Naval Base area, in August 1949. This is now the area around Sembawang Road. Religious services started at an old Japanese language school which was left over from World War II. The school was located in Jalan Kedai, off Canberra Road. Fr. Dominic Vendargon, (Aug 29, 1909 ‚Äì Aug 3, 2005) was appointed by the then Bishop of Malacca & Singapore, Bishop Michel Ol√ßomendy, M.E.P., to formulate a self-sufficient parish. In August 1950, Fr. Vendargon was succeeded by Fr. Albert Fortier (Apr 24, 1911- Jan 13, 1998). Fr. Fortier conducted everything, from Masses, marriages and all other rites, at the Japanese school. By 1952, the old school had become so rundown and unsafe that the British Colonial authorities advised Fr. Fortier to build a new church. Fr. Fortier found a plot of land in Jalan Sendudok which was part of the British Naval Base. The British Colonial authorities approved the site for a 21-year lease. The building of the church was completed in 1953. Fr. Fortier was succeeded by Fr. I. Fernandez, for the next 10 years, followed by Fr. Bernard Binet from 1964 to 1968. Fr. Albert Fortier returned to assume the role of Parish Priest in July 1968. Fr Fortier served in the church until his retirement on 31 December 1986. Fr. Amiotte-Suchet Louis (Aug 29, 1917- Oct 17, 1998) was appointed to take over from the duties of Fr. Fortier. On 26 August 1987, the Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea was informed by the authorities that \\"the premises and the land are scheduled to be cleared by 31 December 1987 and you are hereby notified to move out by this date\\". The present site for the Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea was bought by the Archdiocese of Singapore on 6 March 1989. The church was officially blessed by the Archbishop of Singapore, Gregory Yong, on 30 May 1992. Organisation The Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea currently has 3 priests administering to a parish population of 6000plus parishioners.

Derived export versions are the 3M54E, 3M54E1, 3M14E, 91RE1, 91RTE2. The 3M54T, 3M54K, 3M54A, 3M54E (3M54TE), 3M54KE and 3M54AE have a second stage that performs a supersonic sprint in the terminal approach to the target, reducing the time that target's defense systems have to react. The 3M54T1, 3M54K1, 3M54A1, 3M54E1 (3M54T/K/AE1) only travel at subsonic speeds, although their range is accordingly greater than those of the supersonic versions. Club is the designation used for the export versions. Design The missile is a modular system with five versions: two anti-shipping types, one for land attack and two anti-submarine types. The missile is designed to share common parts between the surface and submarine-launched variants but each missile consists of different components, for example, the booster. The missile can be launched from a surface ship using a Vertical Launch System (VLS). It has a booster with thrust vectoring capability. The missile launched from a submarine torpedo tube has no need for such an addition but has a conventional booster instead. The air launched version is held in a container that is dropped as the missile launches, detaching from the container. Kalibr land attack versions in use by Russia have various claimed maximum ranges. The U.S. Department of Defense estimates its range at , and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu put its range at \\"almost .\\" Following its first operational firing in October 2015, Russian Ministry of Defence statements suggested a range of , while a December 2015 Office of Naval Intelligence report gathered a number of Russian statements projecting ranges between 1,500-. Discrepancies in range values may be attributed to political declarations for strategic effect, or potentially longer 2,500 km-range claims could be associated with a thermonuclear armed variant while shorter 1,500 km- range estimates are for the conventionally armed missile.Sokov on Russian Cruise Missiles - Armscontrolwonk.com, 25 August 2015 =Terminal supersonic flight= maquette The Russian domestic variant (3M54T / 3M54K) and export variants (3M54TE/3M54KE) fly at sub-sonic speeds while achieving supersonic speed as they near their target. They are also capable of performing very high angled defensive high speed maneuvers in contrast to the common linear flight path of other anti-ship cruise missiles.

Designed to defeat surface and ground targets. The complex can be mounted on shorelines, vessels of various classes, rail platforms and trucks. It is a modification of the Kalibr missile system. The Russian Kilo class, Lada class, Akula class, Yasen class, and Borei class are the submarine launch platforms for the missiles. The Russian Admiral Gorshkov class, Admiral Grigorovich class, and Gepard class frigates are able to carry these missiles. Also the Indian Talwar class frigate is another shipborne launch platform for the Club missile system. The Russian Gremyashchy class, Buyan-M class, the second batch of Steregushchy class corvettes and the Karakurt class are low displacement platforms with Kalibr system ability. In addition, it is believed by some analysts that an air-launched variant will be developed to arm the Tu-142s currently in service with the Russian navy. A truck mounted version is planned for development by the Novator Design Bureau. A Club-K variant, which is disguised as a shipping container that can be placed on a truck, train, or merchant vessel, was advertised in 2010 and was shown for the first time at the MAKS 2011 air show. Putting the launcher system into a standard shipping container allows the missiles to be moved and stored without arousing suspicion, which in turn renders pre-emptive strikes against the launcher very difficult. In MAKS 2007, the 3M-54AE was placed beside a Su-35. This means the plane will have the ability to launch the Club-A variants. The lighter 3M-14AE was also beside MiG-35.

Having joined in 1893 as one of its founding members, the club is one of oldest elite cricket clubs in Sydney. The club's home ground is the famous North Sydney Oval where it has remained since its inception. In the 1980s, North Sydney Council purchased some old grandstands from the Sydney Cricket Ground during its re-development, and relocated them to North Sydney Oval. In the 1980s, the club and community recognised the potential of the Miller St location and worked with the then North Sydney Mayor and current club Patron Ted Mack to develop the ground, enhancing its historic character. The Bears have won 5 first grade premierships, 11 second grade cups, 9 third grade titles, and one each in fifth grade, Poidevin Gray (U21s) and AW Green Shield (U16s). In the 1980s and 1990s, a powerful North Sydney side captured four limited-overs titles from six.

It is compatible for both offline or online play via Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.  Development and release  The development and release of the Xbox 360 version of Worms was significantly delayed due to a disagreement during the certification process prior to release, over the requirement of an in-game means of providing opposing player feedback in post-game lobbies. This delay in the certification process was a source of a frustration for everyone involved. Downloadable content released in May and July 2007 included new costumes, voices, and environments for the games. The game has since taken on the moniker, Worms (2007). Its first official public demonstration was on the showroom floor of the 2007, Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in March 2007 for Xbox 360, March 2009 for PlayStation 3, and July 2009 on iOS. The 2007 version of Worms is an enhanced port of Worms: Open Warfare, which itself is a remake of the original 1995 video game of the same name. = Downloadable content = On May 30, 2007, several new downloadable Worms packs were released.

Nabors, is a Pentecostal Christian denomination with roots in the late 19th-century American Holiness movement and early 20th-century Pentecostal revival. It shares a common history with The Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee) (TCOG) until 2006 when a separation occurred. The official name is The Church of God. The phrase Alexander Jackson Sr. General Overseer is added to distinguish this group from many others called Church of God. The Church of God claims a membership from many states in the United States and 24 nations worldwide. The official publication of The Church of God, The Arise Shine, is printed monthly in Cleveland, Tennessee and sent out internationally. The church's general headquarters are located in Cleveland. History =Origins= The Church of God developed from a movement led by Richard Spurling and Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson which would become in 1903 the Church of God. Throughout its history the Church of God movement has experienced a number of divisions. In 1923, Tomlinson was impeached as General Overseer of the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee). This caused a part of the church to separate and form the Church of God of Prophecy which continued to be led by Tomlinson. In 1943, he was succeeded by his son Milton Ambrose Tomlinson who served as General Overseer until his retirement in 1990. That year during the election of M. A. Tomlinson's successor, another schism occurred. One group within the Church of God of Prophecy declared that the selection process of Tomlinson's successor was a departure from what had historically been perceived as \\"theocratic government\\" within the body's governing structure and procedure. In 1993, this group called for a \\"solemn assembly\\", borrowing an Old Testament term for corporate devotion to prayer to rhetorically emphasize its earnestness. Coincidentally, the \\"solemn assembly\\" resulted in the formation of The Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee). Robert J. Pruitt was chosen to be the new overseer, and he remained so until 2006, when age-related disability prompted his retirement. =2006 Continuation= Once again division characterized the succession process. A meeting of leadership of The Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee) during the summer of 2006 ended with the selection of Stephen Smith as the interim General Overseer. In September of the same year during the 101st General Assembly of TCOG (Charleston, Tennessee), Stephen Smith was selected to be the organizations General Overseer, after not vacating the office of Interim General Overseer. There was then a group of people who chose to remove themselves from the Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee) and continue as The Church of God over which Bishop James C. Nabors is General Overseer. During a meeting on September 3, 2006, at the Tivoli Auditorium, Bishop James C. Nabors was chosen to be the General Overseer of a new organization. Bishop James C. Nabors previously had been administrative assistant and field secretary to the former general overseer of The Church of God (Charleston), Robert J. Pruitt. In 2009 Bishop James C. Nabors was removed as General Overseer. In 2009 Bishop Alexander Jackson Sr. was selected by unanimous agreement by the Overseers during a called meeting in order to act as the Interim General Overseer. During that same year (2009) Bishop Alexander Jackson Sr. vacated the office of Interim General Overseer during the General Assembly. During this same Assembly he was chosen by unanimous agreement by those present that he would continue as General Overseer. At the present moment Bishop Alexander Jackson Sr. is the General Overseer of The Church of God. In 2015 there new Assembly Tabernacle was dedicated in the City of Cleveland, TN where each church event internationally would be held. Beliefs The Church of God is a Pentecostal church in the Wesleyan Holiness tradition. It believes that one is saved or born again as a result of repentance, justification and regeneration. After one is saved, a second work of grace (sanctification) makes living a holy life possible. The church is opposed to the use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs; opposed to membership in secret societies; opposed to wearing jewelry and other ornamentation; and against divorce and remarriage. It also condemns the swearing of oaths. The church believes it is possible to lose salvation, or fall from divine grace, if one goes back into sin.About The Church of God The Church of God believes all the gifts of the Spirit are in operation in the church, and that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is evidenced by speaking in tongues. The church holds the following three ordinances: water baptism by immersion, the Lord's Supper reserved for sinless and consecrated Christians, and feet washing. Tithing is also practiced. This body is premillennial in eschatology. An important belief which distinguishes it from many other Holiness-Pentecostal churches is its assertion that it is the one true church. It believes the Christian Church was established before Pentecost around A.D. 28 and was plunged into apostasy when the First Council of Nicaea was held in A.D. 325. The true church was restored in North Carolina on June 13, 1903, and this is considered a fulfillment of the Isaiah 60:1-5 prophecy. The church experienced disruptions in 1923, 1993, and 2006, but it continues to be the church of God. Structure The Church of God is governed as a theocracy. Christ is considered the head of the church and the Bible, the word of God, as interpreted by the General Assembly is considered the highest authority. The General Assembly, consisting of all members of the TCOG in attendance, functions only as a judicial body, not an executive or legislature, whose duty is to correctly interpret the Bible and insure that God's will is done. While men and women can participate in the General Assembly, only men can have an actual role in decision making. The General Overseer is moderator of the General Assembly and speaks for the church when the General Assembly is not in session. According to the TCOG, \\"the office of General Overseer is filled by Divine appointment\\".

As a member of the illustrious Booth family of actors, Junius Brutus Booth Jr. was overshadowed by his father Junius Sr. and brothers Edwin and John Wilkes (the assassin of Abraham Lincoln) and later by his wife Agnes, a successful actress. Booth was married three times: first briefly to Clementina De Bar, sister of comedian and theatrical manager Ben De Bar; then in California to Harriet Mace, who died giving birth to a daughter; and finally, upon returning East in 1867 and becoming manager of the Boston Theatre, to Agnes Perry (n√©e Rookes), who thereafter was known professionally as Agnes Booth. Junius and Agnes had four children together: Junius Brutus III (1868‚Äì1912), Algernon (1869‚Äì1877), Sydney (1873‚Äì1937), and Barton (1874‚Äì1879). Only two survived to adulthood, and of those two, Junius Brutus III committed suicide in 1912. Booth managed the Boston Theatre, Walnut Street Theatre, Winter Garden Theatre, and Booth's Theatre, where his brother Edwin was the star attraction. Though a relatively undistinguished actor, Junius Jr. was highly regarded for his performances as King John and as Cassius in Julius Caesar. In 1864 he performed Julius Caesar alongside his brothers Edwin (as Brutus) and John Wilkes (as Mark Antony). Booth in the early 1860s Junius Brutus Booth Jr. himself was briefly imprisoned in Washington, DC, after his brother assassinated Abraham Lincoln. At the time of the assassination, he was fulfilling an acting engagement at Pike's Opera House in Cincinnati. Booth left Cincinnati by train on April 17th and arrived in Philadelphia on April 19th. Booth notified the U.S. Marshall of his presence in the city and was arrested and hurried by train to the Old Capitol Prison, where he was interrogated and released. Booth retired in 1881 to Masconomo House in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, where he died on September 17, 1883. He was buried in Manchester's Rosedale Cemetery. Although Agnes Booth remarried in 1885, she continued performing under the Booth name, and was buried next to him when she died in 1910.

Taxonomy All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) The black-capped tinamou has two subspecies as follows: * C. a. atrocapillus, nominate race, occurs in the lowlands of southeastern Peru. * C. a. garleppi in the lowlands of northern Bolivia.Clements, J (2007) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Description The black-capped tinamou is approximately in length. Its upper-parts are brown, mottled and barred blackish, throat and neck are rufescent, breast is dark grey, and the remainder of underparts are cinnamon to buff. Its cap is blackish and legs could be pale red or bright red. The females are more heavily barred above. Behavior Like other tinamous, the black-capped eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2‚Äì3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range and habitat It is found in moist forest lowlands in subtropical and tropical regions up to altitude. This species is native to southeastern Peru and northern Bolivia. Has recently been recorded in BrazilBORGES, L. H. (2013). [WA1036257, Crypturellus atrocapillus (Tschudi, 1844)].

Training and education  Born in Christchurch in 1924, Beard trained in architecture at Auckland University, and was an early member of the Wellington Architectural Centre (formed in 1946). He worked for the Ministry of Works architectural office becoming a cadet supervisor in the late 1940s. He was actively involved with the Wellington Architectural Centre, particularly in the 1940s, 1950s and 1980s. After passing the Royal Town Planning Institute (London) examinations in Wellington (while working at the New Zealand Ministry of Works), he received a scholarship and went to M.I.T. to study city planning (1951‚Äì1952). Later at Harvard University he studied for a Masters in Landscape Architecture. In the 1960s he co-founded Gabites and Beard Registered Architects and Town Planning Consultants in Wellington and played an active role in the New Zealand Institute of Architects. In the late 1960s he returned to America to work as a Research Assistant (1967‚Äì1968) at the Harvard Graduate School of Design where he worked with Peter Hornbeck and Peter Jacobs co- producing Highway Esthetics: functional criteria for planning and design (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1968).  Private practice  From 1971 to 1972, Beard was part of the architectural partnership Gabites, Toomath, Beard, Wilson & partners. Following this he formed James Beard & Co. In the 1980s he was responsible for the major repair, strengthening and restoration of the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace in Thorndon, including substantial conservation research (this material and documentation is deposited at the Alexander Turnbull Library), and was extensively involved in the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architecture. Beard was involved in a range of buildings and landscape design. He is recognised for his residential work (especially the Beard House, Hauraki Street, Karori (1955), and apartment design in the 1960s), and two well-known inner city Wellington buildings: the Hannah Playhouse (1973) for Downstage Theatre, and P.S.I.S. Investment House (1976). He was involved in significant landscape projects (e.g. the Te Marua Lakes Project, Kaitoke Regional Park). His work was characterised as a multi- disciplinary practice, drawing on his skills in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture and town planning. He was also involved in teaching architecture at a tertiary level at Auckland University, Wellington Technical College, Wellington Polytechnic and Victoria University of Wellington. Beard died in Wellington on 30 October 2017. Service to the profession Elected a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Architects in 1969, Beard was closely involved in the institute at a national level, serving on the education committee (1968‚Äì1970), publications committee (1965‚Äì1969), journal committee (1963‚Äì1964) and library and journal committee (1964‚Äì1965). He was the president of the Wellington Architectural Centre (1962), a committee member (1958‚Äì1960, 1982‚Äì1986), and was honoured as a life member. His service to the design community also included involvement with the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Designers, and the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects, of which he was made an Honorary Fellow in 1998.  Influence and significance  Beard was a significant New Zealand architect. In his work at the Ministry of Works he influenced a generation of architects (including people such as Bill Alington). He was one of the few New Zealand architects of his generation to undertake postgraduate study at an overseas university, studying town planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then landscape architecture at Harvard University. He was thus one of the few qualified town planners and landscape architects working in New Zealand in the 1950s and 1960s. It was not until 1969 that Lincoln University established the Postgraduate Diploma in Landscape Architecture ‚Äì the first full-time course in landscape architecture in Australasia. Beard also made a significant contribution to concrete apartment design in Wellington in the late 1950s and early 1960s, examples of which exist in Hamilton Road, Hataitai, Tapiri Street/William Street, Hataitai, Brougham Street, Mount Victoria, and Wellington Road, Kilbirnie. These were exercises in providing both liveable modern homes and efficient planning, at a time when single unit detached dwellings were the norm. He is perhaps best known within architectural circles for his significant contribution to Wellington's inner city examples of Brutalist architecture, namely the Hannah Playhouse (1973) and PSIS Investment House (1976). His work on the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace is also significant as a contribution to New Zealand's national cultural heritage. This work included various reports and research work. The unpublished material is held within the Alexander Turnbull Library Manuscripts Collections. Published material on this work includes: Beard, James Mansfield Precinct (Wellington [N.Z.]: New Zealand Heritage and Conservation Trust and the Wellington Heritage and Conservation Trust, [2005]). Katherine Mansfield Birthplace received a New Zealand Tourism Award in 1994. Beard contributed to New Zealand architecture and landscape design and architecture, as well as town planning throughout his career, both as a professional and as an astute and committed commentator in institute and organisational publications such as: New Zealand Architect/Architecture New Zealand, The Landscape, Cuttings, and Off Centre. He gave service to organisations such as the Wellington Architectural Centre, the New Zealand Institute of Architects, the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Designers, and founded the Wellington Heritage and Conservation Trust as part of his efforts to lobby for a better built environment. As Michael Jones has noted, \\"Beard has exerted a sustained influence on late 1960s attitudes to the landscape ‚Äì as a regular commentator on national and civic policy and action.\\" (Jones \\"Professional recognition\\" p. 9.) His work, in particular the Hannah Playhouse, is also deemed to have national significance as it is represented in the Drawings, Photographs and Manuscripts Collections at the Alexander Turnbull Library at the National Library in Wellington. In addition both the libraries at the Schools of Architecture at University of Auckland, and Victoria University hold collections of Beard's writings on Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Town Planning. The Hannah Playhouse used by Downstage Theatre is also recognised with its inclusion in the Wellington City Council Heritage Building Inventory, and his and Al Gabites' 1965 proposed \\"Precinct Planning for Wellington\\" was exhibited in \\"Unbuilt Wellington,\\" at the Wellington City Art Gallery.

In the United States, the lower class are those at or near the lower end of the socio-economic hierarchy. As with all social classes in the United States, the lower class is loosely defined and its boundaries and definitions subject to debate and ambiguous popular opinions. Sociologists such as W. Lloyd Warner, Dennis Gilbert and James Henslin divide the lower classes into two. The contemporary division used by Gilbert divides the lower class into the working poor and underclass. Service and low-rung manual laborers are commonly identified as being among the working poor. Those who do not participate in the labor force and rely on public assistance as their main source of income are commonly identified as members of the underclass. Overall the term describes those in easily filled employment positions with little prestige or economic compensation who often lack a high school education and are to some extent disenfranchised from mainstream society. Estimates for how many households are members of this class vary with definition. According to Dennis Gilbert roughly one quarter, 25%, of US households were in the lower classes; 13% were members among the working poor while 12% were members of the underclass. While many in the lower working class are employed in low-skill service jobs, lack of participation in the labor force remains the main cause for the economic plight experienced by those in the lower classes. In 2005, the majority of households (56%) in the bottom income quintile had no income earners while 65% of householders did not work. This contrasts starkly to households in the top quintile, 76% of whom had two or more income earners. Lacking educational attainment as well as disabilities are among the main causes for the infrequent employment. Many households rise above or fall below the poverty threshold, depending on the employment status of household members. While only about 12% of households fall below the poverty threshold at one point in time, the percentage of those who fall below the poverty line at any one point throughout a year is much higher. Working class as well as working poor households may fall below the poverty line if an income earner becomes unemployed. In any given year roughly one out of every five (20%) households falls below the poverty line at some point while up to 40% may fall into poverty within the course of a decade.

This is not to be confused with the \\"Battle of Wadi Al-Batin\\" which was fought later in the four-day ground war between elements of the U.S. 3rd Armored Division and the Iraqi Republican Guard. Iraqis thought that Coalition forces were prepping the Wadi Al-Batin for the main attack. The desired effect was that the Iraqis would think that the main coalition ground attack would come up the Wadi Al Batin, a natural invasion route, and they would therefore reinforce their forces there, at the expense of the Western flank, where VII Corps would conduct the main attack. Deception movements As American forces secretly redeployed from the southern Kuwaiti border to the northwest, \\"deception cells\\" were left in the south. These units built a computer-generated electronic network which simulated an intense VHF-UHF wireless traffic. When the Iraqi intelligence caught these \\"radio calls\\"--some of them only static hiss--they immediately concluded that the bulk of American forces were still entrenched south of the border.Atkinson, p. 331 Another military deception was the building of fake bunkers and the shuttling of bogus vehicle convoys, only intended to churn up great clouds of dust. Decoy tanks added to the deception of the unsuspecting Iraqi army.Atkinson, p.332 The feint By mid February, General Franks ordered U.S. 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a thrust along the border between Iraq and Kuwait. This misdirection would allow the coalition forces to perform the famous \\"Hail Mary\\" to the West as the Iraqis focused on the Wadi. =Operation Berm Buster= On 15 February, TF 1-32, supported by the division's 8th Engineers, breached the defensive berm built by the Iraqis on the frontier. The 155 mm howitzers of the Division's 3-82nd Field Artillery Regiment kept the Iraqi positions under fire in the course of this operation,Jaco, p. 177 pounding seven pre-established targets. The Iraqis retaliated with sporadic mortar fire. TF 1-32 Armor Scout Platoon, along with the Mortar Platoon and elements of D Company, remained in position overnight. They destroyed a border guard post and ambushed an Iraqi reconnaissance patrol, causing at least 3 Iraqi casualties. =Operation Red Storm= The first phase of the feint was a night attack. Fire support from the 82nd Field Artillery Regiment was required again. The artillery was temporarily reduced to 50% percent when a howitzer was stuck in an antitank ditch, preventing the rest of the convoy from moving ahead. Two soldiers were injured in the accident. Undeterred, the Regiment carried out a precision shelling on an Iraqi radar facility just before 1:00 AM of 16 February. The 82nd immediately moved out of the area after the mission was completed, and a raid by Apache helicopters hit selected targets deep behind the Iraqi lines. =Operation Knight Strike= M1 Abrams in the Gulf War On the evening of 19 February, the 1st Cavalry followed up the artillery attack with a Reconnaissance in Force by Task Force 1-5 CAV (Black Knights) of the 2nd Black Jack Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. The Task Force consisted two M1A1 Abrams Tank Companies, two M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle Companies, an M901 Anti Tank Company, Command and Control elements from the Headquarters of 2nd Brigade, elements of C Battery 4-5 ADA (Stinger and Vulcan Anti Aircraft Systems) and in a combat trains location, elements of the forward support battalion (C Co medical evac). One of the first reaction of the Iraqis, besides firing sporadic mortar rounds, was to set oil trenches on fire. On 20 February, 1-5 CAV broke the border berm in two different points, and after evading a minefield they crossed to the west bank of the wadi. Then the troops of the 2nd Brigade maneuvered northwards for six miles. Their orders were \\"Do not become decisively engaged, and do not attrit your force.\\"Lowry, p. 83 At midday, a scout platoon reported that they were exchanging fire with the enemy. Seven Iraqi soldiers surrendered.Atkinson, p. 332 As reinforcements were pushing forward, the column was ambushed by Iraqi troops using mortars and T-12 anti-tank guns hidden on the reverse slope of a low ridge. Intense direct and indirect fire erupted. The Brigade commander, Col. Randolph House, was personally forced to retreat rearwards after his M113 vehicle was nearly hit by several shells.Halberstadt, p. 35 M163 Vulcan AA vehicle Before a skirmish line could be formed, an M163 Vulcan was destroyed by a 100 mm round. The gunner, Sergeant Jimmy D. Haws, was killed instantly. A Bradley IFV spraying 25 mm fire on Iraqi trenches was also hit; its gunner, Sergeant Ronald Randazzo, was killed and two other men were wounded as result.Atkinson, p. 333 Another Bradley, commanded by Staff Sergeant Christopher Cichon, came forward to evacuate these casualties. While Sergeant Cichon and the soldiers from his Bradley were rescuing wounded personnel from the first Bradley, the Iraqis continued to fire. Private First Class Ardon Cooper covered a wounded man with his own body to shield him from enemy fire and was hit in the neck by a fragment from a mortar round, just as Sergeant Cichon's Bradley was struck on the turret by a round which shattered its TOW launcher, spraying Cooper with shrapnel. He died later from heavy loss of blood.Atkinson, Rick: Crusade: The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War, p. 333 Cooper was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.Lowry, p. 84 Cichon's Bradley was still operational, and after picking up the wounded, its crew managed to withdraw it from the line of fire. Staff Sergeant Cichon was awarded the Silver Star for his exceptional leadership and courage while under enemy fire. Specialist Adkins and Sgt Frank Knox of Charlie Company were moved forward with the battalions medical officer Major Noel in an attempt to reach Bradley Gunner Sergeant Randazzo but Specialist Phillip Adkins received fire which damaged the fuel line and fuel cell and front tires to his Humvee which caused him to withdraw with an Abrams tank shielding. The battle raged for about an hour; after pounding the Iraqi positions with heavy artillery and A-10 air strikes, 1-5 fell back to the berm. During the pull-out, an Abrams tank hit a mine and was heavily damaged. Its crew was uninjured except for some bruises. The Iraqi defenders lost five tanks and 20 artillery pieces. American casualties amounted to three dead and nine wounded. The wisdom of a full-daylight operation was the subject of some criticism, but the Iraqi army remained convinced that the Coalition invasion would take place from the south.

Most of the community has been developed from 2000 to present.  History  Before Torrey Highlands became a residential community,the area was largely used for agricultural purposes. In 1980, the area received an influx of displaced migrant villagers from the Rancho Diablo encampment in Pacific Highlands Ranch, who lived off of the land while working on the farms in the area.Environmental Impact Report: PACIFIC HIGHLANDS RANCH (SUBAREA Ill) SUBAREA PLAN in the NORTH CITY FUTURE URBANIZING AREA (NCFUA). https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/dsderp_pts432080_02.pdf The community of Rancho Diablo lived in between the canyons before being evicted from Torrey Highlands in the 2010's. In 1996, the Torrey Highlands Subarea Plan was approved by the City Council and by the voters of the City of San Diego, graduating from the North City Future Urbanizing Area plan. The community was mostly built in the 2000's as a largely residential community with the State Route 56 cutting through the community. Geography Torrey Highlands is bordered: to the north by Black Mountain Ranch; to the south by Del Mar Mesa; to the east by Rancho Pe√±asquitos; to the west by Pacific Highlands Ranch; and to the northwest by Fairbanks Ranch. The Torrey Highlands Subarea Plan was approved in 1996 by voters and the City Council. The Torrey Highlands Subarea Plan limited dwelling units to no more than 2,600 and designated 50 percent of Torrey Highlands for residential development, 30 percent for parks and open space, 12 percent for schools, 5 percent for commercial, and 3 percent for employment centers.

Not too long after, original vocalist Christian Guerrero left as well. Most recently, Bedlight's bassist and founding member James Granuzzo also left the band. They also contributed to the Punk Goes 90's album, doing a version of Third Eye Blind's \\"Jumper\\" with their original band lineup. It prominently features a piano played by Sebastian Davin of Dropping Daylight throughout the song, and less guitar than the original. As of 2007, the band has reformed with several new members, and recorded a second album, Life on Life's Terms, at Treesound Studios in the United States state of Georgia.

The record was released on Trustkill on July 10, 2007. Life on Life's Terms marked a change in musical style which differentiated from their previous work. Whereas The Dawn was more influenced by emo lyrics and singing/screaming styles, Life on Life's Terms took a more straight-up rock and pop-rock approach. Life on Life's Terms, while not as widely acknowledged as a release as The Dawn, did garner much more positive reviews. Both CDs feature mild guitar solos in various songs despite the somewhat significant changes in musical stylings. Beginning in October 2007, the band began touring with well-known alternative bands New Found Glory and Senses Fail, and in November Bedlight for Blue Eyes toured with Sullivan and Kenotia.

Cloth is a woven or felted fabric made from wool, cotton, or a similar fiber. Cloth modeling is the term used for simulating cloth within a computer program, usually in the context of 3D computer graphics. The main approaches used for this may be classified into three basic types: geometric, physical, and particle/energy.  Background  Most models of cloth are based on \\"particles\\" of mass connected in some manner of mesh. Newtonian Physics is used to model each particle through the use of a \\"black box\\" called a physics engine. This involves using the basic law of motion (Newton's Second Law): : \\\\vec{F} = m \\\\vec{a} In all of these models, the goal is to find the position and shape of a piece of fabric using this basic equation and several other methods.  Geometric methods  Andr√© Weil pioneered the first of these, the geometric technique, in 1986.Tutorial on Cloth Modeling His work was focused on approximating the look of cloth by treating cloth like a collection of cables and using Hyperbolic cosine (catenary) curves. Because of this, it is not suitable for dynamic models but works very well for stationary or single-frame renders. This technique creates an underlying shape out of single points; then, it parses through each set of three of these points and maps a catenary curve to the set. It then takes the lowest out of each overlapping set and uses it for the render.  Physical methods  The second technique treats cloth like a grid work of particles connected to each other by springs. Whereas the geometric approach accounted for none of the inherent stretch of a woven material, this physical model accounts for stretch (tension), stiffness, and weight: : E(Particle_{i,j}) = k_{s}E_{s,i,j} + k_{b}E_{b,i,j} + k_{g}E_{g,i,j} * s terms are elasticity (by Hooke's Law) * b terms are bending * g terms are gravity (see Acceleration due to gravity) Now we apply the basic principle of mechanical equilibrium in which all bodies seek lowest energy by differentiating this equation to find the minimum energy.  Particle/energy methods  The last method is more complex than the first two. The particle technique takes the physical methods a step further and supposes that we have a network of particles interacting directly. Rather than springs, the energy interactions of the particles are used to determine the cloth's shape. An energy equation that adds onto the following is used: : U_{Total} = U_{Repel} + U_{Stretch} + U_{Bend} + U_{Trellis} + U_{Gravity} * The energy of repelling is an artificial element we add to prevent cloth from intersecting itself. * The energy of stretching is governed by Hooke's law as with the Physical Method. * The energy of bending describes the stiffness of the fabric * The energy of trellising describes the shearing of the fabric (distortion within the plane of the fabric) * The energy of gravity is based on acceleration due to gravity Terms for energy added by any source can be added to this equation, then derive and find minima, which generalizes our model. This allows for modeling cloth behavior under any circumstance, and since the cloth is treated as a collection of particles its behavior can be described with the dynamics provided in our physics engine.

It was led by Ainu chieftain Shakushain against the Matsumae clan, who represented Japanese trading and governmental interests in the area of Hokkaid≈ç then controlled by the Japanese (Yamato people). The war began as a fight for resources between Shakushain's people and a rival Ainu clan in the Shibuchari River (Shizunai River) basin of what is now Shinhidaka, Hokkaid≈ç.

According to scholar Brett Walker: > Shakushain's War stands out as a watershed event in the history of the > conquest of Ezo. Shakushain exploded onto the scene as a charismatic leader > who proved able to bridge regional differences among Ainu communities, > threatening to unite them against the Japanese intrusion from the south.

At the end of 1669, Shakushain's forces surrendered to the Matsumae. The two sides exchanged gifts and negotiated a peace settlement; however, while Ainu generals celebrated with \\"liberal helpings of sak√©\\", they were assassinated by Matsumae warriors.

William IV had confided the tutelage of his son to the child's grandmother, Beliarde, and to his nearest relatives: William Arnold, Raymond Stephen, and William Aymoin. After a short conflict with the bishop of Maguelonne, William V rendered homage to the bishop on 10 December 1090 and was recognised as lord of Montpellier. At the call of Pope Urban II, William took up the cross of the First Crusade in the army of Raymond IV of Toulouse. He served notably at the capture of the small Syrian village of Ma'arrat al-Numan in 1098. After the fall of Jerusalem in 1099, William remained in the Holy Land for a while. He remained at the side of Godfrey de Bouillon and accompanied him to the siege of Antioch in December 1097. He did not return to Montpellier until 1103, bringing with him a relic of Saint Cleopas. When William returned, he found that the Aimoin brothers to whom he had confided the administration of the lordship in his absence had usurped many seigniorial rights and that he was obligated to recognise much of their newfound authority, which diminished his own, in order to retain his position. William participated in the army of Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona which captured Majorca from the Moors in 1114. The rest of his reign was marked by the important acquisition of nearby territories, which greatly recouped his power: Montarnaud, Cournonsec, Montferrier, Frontignan, Aumelas, Montbazin, Popian. By his marriage to Ermensenda, daughter of Peter, Count of Mauguio, he had six children: *William VI *William of Aumelas *Bernard, Lord of Villeneuve *Guillelme, married Raymon Bernard, Count of Mauguio *Ermeniarde *Adelaide. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son William as Lord of Montpellier.

It has not been released outside of Japan. It was adapted into an anime (Master of Epic: The Animation Age) by Gonzo and Palm Studio, and aired on TV Tokyo in 2007. Unlike many MMORPGs, Master of Epic has dispensed with levels and instead the player has an extensive list of skills, from strength to clubs to magics to business, that level up through use. Classes are not chosen. However, titles are earned when certain skills or combinations of skills reach high enough ranks. Some of its other distinguishing features include the presence of hunger and thirst which will inhibit your combat abilities when they run low, and flies gathering around you if your hair goes unwashed for too long. Story Diaros, a land shrouded in mystery. Only legends exist about Diaros. Out of all of those, everyone knows the legend of the Noah Stone: any nation possessing the Noah Stone will flourish‚Äîrather, It's said to possess enormous power greater than that. Many Nations seeking the Noah Stone have dispatched countless soldiers, however, all of them have failed. Time passed, when suddenly a vision appeared to all throughout the world. She called herself Irmina. Irmina spoke to the world: \\"Soon you will all enter an age of darkness.\\" Adventurers who were led by Irmina ended up on Diaros, where they came to know its past and future. 13 Million Years Ago. On Diaros, the High Civilization of the Mora Clan flourished due to the power of the Noah Stone. However, people seeking the Nor Stone began to persecute the Mora Clan. Due to this persecution, the Mora Clan was forced to relinquish control of the Noah Stone. Now, the Present Age. Presently there are 3 influencing forces present in Diaros: Elgadin, County of the Dragon Knights who esteem law and order; Bisque, Country where according to the Lal Fac Faith, various clans are given the freedom to regulate themselves; Sasool, Country where therianthropy plays a leading role. These countries vie for control of the Noah Stone that the Mora Clan relinquished. 10 years into the future. Due to the events, war has erupted. Evidently this is the Age of Darkness that Irmina predicted. This war is the result of secret maneuvering of the Mora Clan's Igo. In order to possess the power of the Noah Stone for himself, Igo executed several strategic plans. This has become the fate of the Future, The War Age. 3,000 years after the rule of Igo, The Future Age The beginning of everything, 45 Million Years Ago, The Chaos Age Passing From one age to another and back again, surmounting numerous battles, Will the adventurers be able to prevent the coming age of darkness?

Races  In Master of Epic there are many races for PCs, NPCs, etc. Below are described the 4 races that players are able to select from. =Newtar= Holding unlimited potential, Newtar are similar to humans, but truly a different race. They can be found all across the world, and are known for continuing to look young. They were once great figures in history, but their origins elude us. =Cognite= Cognite Cognite prefer not to intermingle with the other races, and enjoy Alchemy and Ancient History. It's been said that they draw the attention of corrupt shopkeepers with their good looks. The Cognite possess great passion and beautiful voices, fascinating many who watch them dance. =Elmony= Elmony Officially known as Elcapmonia, they are commonly referred to as Elmony. They prefer quiet places like Forests and Rivers and are known to be a gentle and cheerful race. They seem to be hiding some supernatural abilities, but no one is certain. =Pandemos= Contrary to their courageous appearance, they are tender hearted and prefer not to fight. However, occasionally, when their emotions explode, the demonstrate an unstoppable ferocity. Because of memories of the war between races long ago, they seem to be afraid of Elmony. =Others= In addition to these, many other races exist: from the descendants of the ancients, the Mora Clan; the race of fish people who rule over the caverns of water, the Ixion Tribe; and other original clans to the well-known races like Humans, Ogres, Dwarfs, and Elves. Anime Master of Epic: The Animation Age is the official anime adaption of the game. Though many video and computer games are adapted into anime, Master of Epic is unique in that its series is a comedy/parody of the game. It features short sketch comedy vignettes featuring both recurring and one-shot characters, which poke fun at the game mechanics and the sometimes illogical rules of MMORPGs in general. Each sketch typically focuses on a specific skill, highlighting the game's unique skill system. The episodes begin with a brief host segment in which two characters explain a specific game element, (such as skills, death, or weapons) and this element tends to be a recurring theme in all the sketches for that episode, not unlike the setup on You Can't Do That on Television. The show has a number of characters who may take on several different roles in varying skits, often appearing as different characters, not unlike members of a comedy troupe. The episodes also contain numerous inside jokes for fans of the game.

Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Ren√©-Primev√®re Lesson identified the thicket tinamou from a specimen from La Uni√≥n, El Salvador., in 1842. =Subspecies= The thicket tinamou has many subspecies as follows: * C. c. cinnamomeus (Nominate race) occurs in coastal southeastern Mexico (Chiapas) State, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. * C. c. occidentalis occurs on the coastal western Mexico; Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoac√°n, and Guerrero States. * C. c. mexicanus occurs in coastal northeastern Mexico; Tamaulipas, northern Veracruz, and Puebla States. * C. c. sallaei occurs in southern Mexico; Puebla, Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southern Veracruz States. * C. c. goldmani occurs in southeastern Mexico, on the Yucatan Peninsula; Yucat√°n, Quintana Roo, Campeche, and eastern Tabasco States, northern Pet√©n Department, Guatemala, and northern Belize. * C. c. soconuscensis occurs on the Pacific slope of Chiapas and Oaxaca States, Mexico. * C. c. vicinior occurs in the highlands of Chiapas State, Mexico, Guatemala, and western Honduras. * C. c. delattrii occurs in the Pacific lowlands of Nicaragua; Chinandega, Le√≥n, Managua, Carazo, Masaya, Granada, and Rivas Departments. * C. c. praepes occurs in the lowlands of northwestern Costa Rica; Guanacaste, and northern Puntarenas Provinces. Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos (Œ∫œÅœÖœÄœÑœåœÇ) meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) =Description= The thicket tinamou is in length and weighs . Its upper parts are brown, heavily barred blackish on back, rump and wings. Its lowerparts pale brown, cinnamon on breast, greyer on belly and undertail whitish with dark barring. Its head brown with prominent buff supercilium and well-defined ear covert patch with bill brownish and legs red in color. Behavior The species has a monotonous voice ‚Äòwhoo-oo‚Äô, sounding like a steam engine. The thicket tinamou can be found in pairs, families or as a solitary bird and, like most tinamous, it prefers to walk than fly. =Feeding= Like most tinamous, it will eat fruit, seeds and invertebrates. =Reproduction= egg of Crypturellus cinnamomeus - MHNT Like most tinamous, it will place its nest on the ground alongside raised roots. It will contain around three eggs, but as many as seven, that are glossy and purple in color. This species and the slaty-breasted tinamou will produce hybrids. Range This species ranges from Sinaloa, (coastal strip, western Mexico), to Costa Rica, and eastern coastal Mexico, from the United States border into Belize. In the southern part of its range it ventures into the highlands as well.Clements, J (2007) Habitat This species prefers moist lowland forest, gallery forest, deciduous forest, and secondary forest in subtropical and tropical regions, but will be found in shrubland and drier forests up to altitude.BirdLand International (2008) Conservation The IUCN lists this bird as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

Despite its conical shape and its proximity to lava flows and small volcanoes, it is not itself a volcano, but an igneous intrusion. The core of the mountain is Precambrian granite. The peak rises dramatically from its surroundings on all sides; the summit is almost above the Rio Grande Valley, to the east. The name of the peak means \\"thief\\", and \\"Sierra Ladrones\\" means \\"thieves' mountains.\\" Navajo and Apache raiding parties, and later Hispanic and Anglo rustlers, used the mountains as hideouts, hence the name.

He became a professor of preaching at Covenant Theological Seminary in 1985, where he also served as dean of faculty (1987‚Äì1994), president (1994‚Äì2012), and chancellor (2012‚Äì2013). On Easter, 2013, he became senior pastor of the historic Grace Presbyterian Church in Peoria, Illinois and ministered in that capacity until 2020. In 2020, Chapell became the Stated Clerk Pro Tempore of the Presbyterian Church in America.  Unlimited Grace  In 2015, Chapell and members from Grace Presbyterian Church founded Unlimited Grace Media, an independent non-profit media ministry dedicated to spreading the gospel of God's grace to all people. He hosts a daily half-hour radio Bible teaching program called \\"Unlimited Grace,\\" which began airing in 2016 both nationally and internationally.  Speaker  Chapell is a speaker in churches and conferences around the world, preaching and lecturing on topics including grace, marriage, worship, and Christ-centered preaching. Homiletics Chapell's book Christ-Centered Preaching: Redeeming the Expository Sermon is considered his magnum opus. It won Preaching magazine's Book of the Year award in 1994. In it, Chapell explains his concept of the \\"Fallen Condition Focus\\" (FCF): \\"the mutual human condition that contemporary believers share with those for or by whom the text was written that requires the grace of the passage to manifest God's glory in his people.\\" Chapell's approach is to raise the FCF in the sermon's introduction, while the body of the sermon responds to the FCF by giving its redemptive purpose. Zack Eswine suggests that the FCF \\"helpfully urges the preachers to account for Christians in a fallen world,\\" but that it is \\"equipped primarily as a tool for churched contexts.\\"  Writings  Chapell has written several other books, including: *\\"Unlimited Grace\\" *\\"Christ-Centered Worship\\" *\\"The Gospel According to Daniel\\" *\\"The Promises of Grace\\" *\\"Using Illustrations to Preach with Power\\" *\\"Each for the Other\\" *\\"Commentary on Ephesians\\" *\\"The Wonder of It All\\" *\\"1 & 2 Timothy and Titus: To Guard the Deposit (with R. Kent Hughes)\\" *\\"Holiness by Grace\\" *\\"Praying Backwards: Transform Your Prayer Life by Beginning in Jesus' Name\\" *\\"The Hardest Sermons You'll Ever Have to Preach\\" *\\"I'll Love You Anyway and Always, a children's book\\" He has also written many academic and devotional articles as well as lyrics to several hymns.  Religious Service  Chapell is a founding member of The Gospel Coalition and continues to serve with its leadership. Chapell has served with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association both in national crusades and in ministries to China. In November 2009, Chapell signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox to support the religious right to address issues that go against religious conscience such as human trafficking, abortion, same-sex marriage, etc. Chapell has served in numerous roles of academic leadership, including the Standards Committee of the Association of Theological Schools. In the national life of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), Chapell has served as Moderator (2014), a member of the Constitutional Business Committee, the Standing Judicial Committee, the Strategic Planning Committee, the Credentials Committee, and numerous local and regional offices. Chapell has served on the boards of Serge, byFaith Magazine, God's World Publications, Cass Information Systems, Inc., and in advisory roles for numerous boards, churches and academic institutions.

Palazzo Borghese is a palace in Rome, Italy, the main seat of the Borghese family. It was nicknamed il Cembalo (\\"the harpsichord\\") due to its unusual trapezoidal groundplan; its narrowest facade faces the River Tiber. The entrance at the opposite end of the building, the \\"keyboard\\" of the cembalo, faces onto the Fontanella di Borghese, with another in a great flanking facade to the Piazza Borghese that is extended by a slightly angled facade leading down Via Borghese towards the river. Both these entrances lead into a large courtyard on one side of which is a two level open arcade, with paired Doric and Ionic columns, that frames the garden beyond. The first floor of the palace is the seat of the Embassy of Spain in Italy since 1947. History The architectural historian Howard Hibbard has demonstrated that the nine-bay section of the palace on Piazza Fontanella Borghese was begun in 1560/61 for Monsignor Tommaso del Giglio, whose coat of arms or stemma remain over the door in Piazza Borghese, and he suggests that the architect was Vignola,Hibbard, The Palazzo Borghese (Rome:American Academy) 1962. Former attributions were to Martino Longhi the Elder, an architect who did not show such imagination and vitality elsewhere, and who was not yet in Rome in 1560-61. an attribution accepted by Anthony Blunt,Reviewing Hibbard 1962 in The Burlington Magazine 105 No. 729 (December 1963), p 566. considered conclusive by James S. AckermanReviewing Hibbard, 1962 in The Art Bulletin 45.2 (June 1963), pp. 163-164, and followed by other scholars since, with more or less reduced interventions by Longhi. Before Tomasso del Giglio died in 1578, the fa√ßade and the unique but undocumented double-columned two-storey arcade of the courtyard had been established, a conceptual scheme of Vignola's, Hibbard suggested, but which was carried out in 1575-78 by Martino Longhi the Elder. Longhi was retained by Pedro Cardinal Deza, who bought the property in 1587, but seems to have done little more than continue the great courtyard. Cardinal Camillo Borghese purchased the structure in 1604 and acquired further adjacent properties towards the river.This included a 16th- century structure owned by the Farnese, accounting for the kink in the facade. When the Cardinal became Pope Paul V in 1605, he gave the palace to his brothers but continued to commission the work, which was carried forward vigorously, at first by Flaminio Ponzio, and completed after Ponzio's death in 1613 by Carlo Maderno and Giovanni Vasanzio. Ponzio extended the square courtyard from five to seven bays, and the oval stair between the courtyard and a garden that stretched as far as the Ripetta. He also constructed the secondary facade onto the Piazza Borghese and down towards the Tiber, with balconies above the rusticated entrance on the Via di Ripetta. On the death of his uncle, Cardinal Scipione Borghese took up residence and undertook changing the garden to a loggia and hanging garden.Blunt, Anthony. Guide to Baroque Rome, Granada, 1982, p.167. Falda's engraving of the Porto di Ripetta in the 1660s showing the loggia, gardens and gate as seen from the Tiber side, is published by Blunt, 1972, p.254, illustration 104 In 1671-76 Carlo Rainaldi added new features for Prince Giovan Battista Borghese; the most extensive changes were made on the newly raised ground floor of the long wing extending towards the Tiber, ending with river views, which the Borghese found the most congenial dwelling spaces: Rainaldi added the columnar loggia to Ponzi's end facade (illustration, right), and on the interior a richly stuccoed oval chapel, and the narrow barrel-vaulted galleria, the highly charged Cortonesque decorative details of which were designed by Giovan Francesco Grimaldi (1606-1680).This transverse galleria was not the former Picture Gallery in the palazzo. (Howard Hibbard, \\"Palazzo Borghese Studies - II: The Galleria\\" The Burlington Magazine 104 No. 706 (January 1962), pp. 9-20.) The Porto di Ripetta, the port of Rome, was along the river bank of the Via di Ripetta. From 1707, the Tiber side of Palazzo Borghese would have overlooked the scenographic steps of the Porto di Ripetta designed by Alessandro Specchi. The port was destroyed in the 19th century with the development of Lungotevere.See the anonymous engraved view of the Porto di Ripetta designed by Specchi in Blunt, 1982, p.254, illustration 254 Overview The main fa√ßades have three stories with two mezzanines inserted between them and the two majestic portals are flanked by columns and a balcony. Through the portal on the Piazza Fontanella Borghese, a view across the courtyard is centred on one of the wall fountains in the garden beyond. The edifice has a magnificent inner courtyard, surrounded by ninety-six granite columns and decorated with statues, a nympheum, and other features, as well as an enclosed garden with three niche wall-fountains built to designs by Johann Paul Schor and finished by Rainaldi for Prince Giovan Battista Borghese in 1673.Howard Hibbard, \\"Palazzo Borghese Studies I: The Garden and Its Fountains\\" The Burlington Magazine 100 No. 663 (June 1958), pp. 204-212, 215. The court has been described as \\"one of the most spectacular existing, not only in Rome\\".Zeppegno, cited in . The fa√ßade towards the Piazza Fontanella Borghese faces another Borghese palace, rebuilt in the 16th century by Scipio Borghese to house the lesser members of the family, the stables and the servants. Palazzo Borghese was the original seat of the family's art collection, with works by Raphael, Titian and many others, transferred in 1891 to the Galleria Borghese in Villa Borghese. The balcony scene in the 1968 film Romeo and Juliet was filmed not at this Palazzo Borghese but at Palazzo Borghese in Artena outside Rome. Notes References Hibbard, Howard.

It is used to remove smoke from buildings, ships or offshore structures to enable emergency evacuation as well as improved firefighting. In North America, fireproofed ductwork may be used for the purpose of smoke exhaust, but it is more common to use unfireproofed return air ductwork, whereby no fire testing or listings are employed to qualify the ductwork for this use. Evidence of this North American practice can be found in the 2010 National Building Code of Canada, 3.2.8.8. Mechanical Exhaust System, as well as Sections 909.16.2 and 910 of the 2015 International Building Code. Means of construction Similar to pressurisation ductwork, smoke exhaust can be built using: *ordinary sheet metal with external fireproofing treatment; or *a proprietary duct that is inherently fire-resistant; or *suitably stiff fireproofing materials, such as calcium silicate. The primary difference between pressurisation and smoke exhaust ducting is that one pressurises an area, while the other reduces the pressure through exhausting smoke. Some smoke exhaust ductwork requires no fireproofing if the smoke is not expected to be at elevated temperature. Markets Smoke exhaust ducting systems for land- based use are found in most industrialised nations. In North America, the primary purpose is to comply with building codes. Grease ducting is closely related and highly regulated in North America as well; its main purpose is exhaust of grease-laden vapours from commercial cooking operations, as opposed to smoke exhaust from accidental building fires. Requirements Full scale fire testing must include three-dimensional exposures to ductwork as well as the firestop system. Installations must meet the listing.

History The Springwood Hotel was built in 1878 by Frank Raymond as a long, single-storied, low-browed building with a simple verandah facing the main road. In 1890 Raymond sold a portion of the land grant that he owned at Springwood to James Lawson who developed the site as a large two storey hotel. It is this building that is listed on the local government heritage register of the City of Blue Mountains. The Oriental Hotel is in a prominent location at the corner of Macquarie Road and Raymond Road. The Victorian origins of the hotel are best seen from Raymond Road where the hipped slate roof, rendered chimneys and vertically proportioned double hung windows are most visible. Facing Macquarie Road the hotel has a two-storey verandah on its main north wing terminated by a hipped front. This composition relates to its Victorian origins, but the verandah has lost its original timber and cast iron structure and the windows have lost their highly decorative surrounds. A two-storey wing to the east, set back from Macquarie Street, was built around the same time as the main wing. The picket fence to Macquarie Street is a reconstruction of the early fence on the site. Current features The pub still operates today, and now also includes a cafe.

At , Shastina is taller than Mount Adams and would rank as the third highest volcano in the Cascades behind Mount Rainier and Shasta were it not nestled on the western flank of its higher neighbor. Shastina has a topographic prominence of over above the saddle connecting it with Shasta and easily exceeds the typical mountaineering standard of for a peak to qualify as an independent summit, yet most lists of Cascade volcanoes omit it nonetheless. The name \\"Shastina\\" is a diminutive of Shasta. Shastina was formed during a VEI-4 eruption around 7650 BC that also involved activity at the summit of Mount Shasta and the Red Banks on Shasta's south flank. Geological features Shastina has the general form of a smooth-sided cone truncated by a one half-mile (0.8 km) diameter summit crater, but with several geological features which make it unique among other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. The most prominent feature when seen from lowland viewpoints is Diller Canyon, a large cleft carved into the western flank by pyroclastic flows and since expanded by erosion. It extends from the crater rim near down for over 7,000 vertical feet (2,100 m) towards the town of Weed in the valley below, and is by far the largest such feature found on any of the Cascade volcanoes. Unseen except by mountaineers and fliers are the three small crater lakes nestled among the cones and ridges of the summit crater, which rarely melt free of snow until late summer. Clarence King Lake at occupies the center of the crater, while Sisson Lake lies at on the eastern side. Highest of all is an unnamed lake at over on the south side of the cinder cone which forms Shastina's true summit. These lakes are the highest subaerial lakes in the entire Cascade Range, exceeded only by the subglacial lake beneath the ice of Mount Rainier's summit crater.  Climbing and skiing  Shastina is most commonly and easily climbed via the Cascade Gulch route, which ascends from Hidden Valley diagonally up to the Shasta- Shastina saddle, and then continuing up the eastern flank of Shastina's cone to its summit. For most mountaineers, it represents only a quick side trip on the way back from the main objective of climbing Shasta. But for ski mountaineers, Shastina represents an attractive objective of its own quite separate from the main peak of Shasta, since it provides several exceptional ski descents including Diller Canyon, the North Face, and the South Face.

The Target building was previously occupied by Montgomery Ward until 2001, and the Burlington Coat Factory store had replaced the Kmart, which closed in 2003.The Associated Press (January 15, 2003). \\"Jantzen Kmart among stores on closure list.\\" The Columbian (Vancouver, Wash.), p. E1. The mall's owners announced further renovation plans in July 2010. Preliminary redevelopment plans would include the demolition of the remaining enclosed portion, as well as the area around the existing Barnes & Noble store. On August 23, 2011, Barnes & Noble and Starbucks both announced that they would be shuttering their stores for good by September 2, 2011. The owners of the Jantzen Beach SuperCenter, Jantzen Dynamic Corporation, also announced that a free-standing Target would be going in at the former Barnes & Noble site, and that the then-existing Target store and adjacent wing of the mall would be permanently demolished. In April 2012, center managers Edens & Avant Realty Inc. announced $50 million in renovations that would begin that month and finish by the middle of 2013. By the time of the 2012 renovations, the mall's name had changed back to Jantzen Beach Center. The new Target store opened in October 2012. The renovations were to include the vintage carousel, but by June 2015, long after completion of the work on the mall, the carousel had not been returned, but remains in storage in a building on the shopping center property. By 2017, the mall's owner was the State of Michigan Retirement System fund, but in July 2017 it was sold by that entity, being advised by Edens, to Kimco Realty, of New York.

He was active in Wellington. He was also known as an environmentalist, and published several works. Early life Wilson grew up on a coastal sheep station owned by the Riddiford family at Tora, Wairarapa, where his father Clement Henry Wilson was the manager. His mother was Ida Agnes Wilson (n√©e Clarkson). Wilson was the oldest of three children: his sister Joan and his brother Godfrey, who became an Anglican bishop. He attended Wanganui Collegiate schools. During World War Two, Wilson trained as a pilot in Florida for the Fleet Air Arm. Architectural practice Wilson trained as an architect at Auckland University College. After graduating, Wilson left New Zealand and worked in London for Ramsey, Murray, White and Ward (the firm of two New Zealand ex-pats Keith Murray and Basil Ward), as well as for Sir Hugh Casson and the London County Council. Returning to New Zealand, he settled in Masterton and then moved to Wellington to join forces with William Toomath to set up Toomath and Wilson. Toomath and Wilson were later joined by Don Irvine and Grahame Anderson in 1972, forming the firm Toomath Wilson Irvine Anderson Ltd. Wilson's design for the Calvert House, in Stokes Valley, was awarded an NZIA Bronze medal. Other work of note includes the Maunsell beach-house at Riversdale Beach, the Wilson house in Khandallah, St Matthew's Church in Brooklyn, Wellington, and his Marine Research Facilities at Wellington's Greta Point (now NIWA) (1980). All are well known as important works in Wellington's architectural history. He was a member of the Wellington Architectural Centre, including as President (1963) and Committee Member (1961‚Äì62, 1964). A recent book, \\"Four Architects\\", celebrates Wellington architecture and includes several of Wilson's designs. Environmental and peace advocacy Wilson was also an active advocate for environmental and anti-nuclear issues, and published on both topics. In 1984, Wilson became the founding co-ordinator of Architects Against Nuclear Arms and was also a member of the Pacific Institute of Resource Management and the National Consultative Committee on Disarmament and Abolition. Perhaps his most significant published work in this area is a 2001 book titled \\"Five Holocausts\\". Personal life Wilson married Diana June Townsend. They had three sons and six grandchildren. Wilson died in Wellington on 10 June 2016.

Jrmcdono.myweb.uga.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-23. was a strike by coal miners represented by the United Mine Workers of America. The strike is also known as the Slovak Strike because about 70 percent of the miners were Slovak immigrants. It began in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911. At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.McDonough, \\"Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miner's Strike, 1910‚Äì1911\\", Pennsylvania History, 1997.Cupp, \\"1910‚Äì11 Irwin Gas Coal Basin Strike Led to Industry Changes\\", Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, February 23, 2007. Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families. The strike ended in defeat for the union. Background The Irwin gas coal basin is an area in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. It encompasses the townships of North Huntingdon, Penn, Sewickley, Salem, South Huntingdon, Hempfield and Irwin, and the boroughs of Murrysville, Export and Delmont. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as coke. However, it was ideal for gasification and conversion into coal gas. Seven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910. In 1854, the Westmoreland Coal Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region. In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the Manor Gas Coal Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest bituminous coal company in Pennsylvania.\\"Westmoreland Coal Company Historical Timeline\\", Westmoreland Coal Company, No date. In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the Jamison Coal and Coke Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).Jamison Coal was sold to the Consolidation Coal Company in 1947, and is now Consol Energy. Van Atta, \\"When Jamison Coal Was King\\", Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, April 10, 1994. In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge Allison White founded the Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.\\"History\\", Berwind Co., 2004. In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around Greensburg, Pennsylvania, merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, Latrobe-Connellsville Coal and Coke Company was formed when Marcus W. Saxman merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.\\"First Saxman Settled Near Latrobe Shortly After Braddock's Defeat\\", Latrobe Bulletin, June 21, 1954. These companies were very paternalistic. Company towns (colloquially referred to as \\"coal patches\\") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in company scrip.Fishback, \\"Did Coal Miners 'Owe Their Souls to the Company Store'? Theory and Evidence from the Early 1900s\\", Journal of Economic History, December 1986. Origins of the strike Coal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an eight-hour day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining \\"slack\\" (very fine coal), and for \\"dead work\\" (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay). Westmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners' demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the Coal and Iron Police to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the \\"coal patches\\" whenever miners struck. The situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined. The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosives‚Äîand pay for these items themselves. Strike Miners' unions had tried to organize Westmoreland County coal mines since 1883, but had little success. In February 1910, however, the lower wage rates and new expenses led miners at Keystone Coal and Coke to meet and discuss their grievances among themselves. The miners decided to invite the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) to form a union. On March 7, 1910, Van Bittner, a UMWA vice president, arrived in Westmoreland County and formed a local union. Four hundred miners signed up and paid dues. Keystone Coke and Coal immediately fired 100 miners for attending the union organizing meeting. The Keystone miners walked off the job, and the strike swiftly spread throughout the Irwin Basin. Union recognition became the biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt that if they could win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.Report on the Miners' Strike in the Bituminous Coal Field in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in 1910‚Äì1911, U.S. House of Representatives, 1912. When the miners struck on March 9, the coal companies evicted thousands of families from their company-owned homes. UMWA spent $25,000 purchasing tents and constructing shanties, and set up 25 tent cities to accommodate the homeless. Near the town of Export, more than 100 tents went up, making it the largest tent city during the strike. Ethnic tension threatened to divide the nascent union. Slovaks comprised 70 percent of the striking miners, but the strike committee was led by native-born miners of English, German and Irish descent. UMWA organizers Bittner and Frank Hayes worked hard to overcome these divisions, however. Multi-lingual organizers were employed, each ethnic group elected its own representatives, and parades and rallies featured musicians and speakers from all groups. Public backing for the strike was high. Westmoreland County had a long history of support for unions. Local religious leaders signed petitions in favor of the union, testified before the United States Congress on behalf of workers, and called on the governor and state legislature to force the coal companies to submit to arbitration. UMWA support for the strike, however, was not nearly as strong. International union president Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased support for the strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources. Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers. Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners. =Strikebreakers= To end the strike and break the union, the coal companies began importing thousands of Eastern European immigrants to work the mines. Coal company representatives on the East Coast promised immigrants a job and housing, and paid for them and their families to move to Pennsylvania. The flow of strikebreakers was small at first, but by the fall it was nearly a flood. The number of new immigrant workers was so large that the Penn Gas Coal company constructed 30 two-story houses in Hahntown to house its replacement workers, leading local residents to refer to the area as \\"Scab Hill\\". Management often took advantage of the strikebreakers, however. Company recruiters were ordered not to tell potential workers that they would be employed as strikebreakers. The coal companies sought out recent immigrants who did not speak English (or who spoke or understood it poorly), and then used this handicap against the strikebreakers. If workers tried to quit, the Coal and Iron Police prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work. In some cases, fences were built around strikebreaker housing to intimidate the workers into staying. The abuse of strikebreakers was so severe that the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Labor held hearings on whether the coal companies had illegally forced people into peonage.The Hearings on H. R. 179, Authorizing Committee on Labor to Investigate Conditions Existing in Westmoreland Coal Fields of Pennsylvania, Committee on Rules, U.S. House of Representatives, May 31, 1911.In Herminie, a twelve-foot fence surrounded the barracks of the strikebreakers. Mine owner John Jamison told a local official, \\"We are going to make [the strikebreakers] a far sight more afraid of us than [the strikers].\\" Kuritz, \\"The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 1891‚Äì1931\\", Pennsylvania History, July 1962.Peonage in Western Pennsylvania, Committee on Labor, U.S. House of Representatives, August 1, 1911. =Labor injunctions and other legal actions= Employers also turned to the courts for assistance. In April 1910, Keystone Coal and Coke sought a restraining order to prevent striking miners from approaching company property on the grounds that the number of strikers and the loud noises they made intimidated company employees. Although the local sheriff testified that the strikers had committed no acts of violence, the state district court issued a sweeping injunction which essentially barred the union from use of public roads: :Miners are restrained from conducting or engaging in marches to the mines, property and works of said Keystone Coal and Coke Company and from assembling at or near the works of said company for the purpose of holding meetings at such places at any time, and from assembling on the highways at such places where the employees of the said company ordinarily pass to and from their work, and from preventing said employees from going peaceably along said injunction: highways and also from attempting by noise, intimidation, threats, personal violence or by any other means to interfere with the employees of said company in their desire to labor or with any of the property of the said company until further order of this court.Cited in McDonough, \\"Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miner's Strike, 1910‚Äì1911\\", Pennsylvania History, 1997. The vague terms of the injunction led law enforcement officials to arrest miners as much as a half mile from Keystone grounds. Other coal companies quickly asked for similar injunctions which \\"made marching, assembling or traversing public roads illegal\\".McDonough, \\"Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miner's Strike, 1910‚Äì1911\\", Pennsylvania History, 1997, p. 395.The court injunctions issued in the Westmoreland County Coal Strike were not only applied in later strikes in Pennsylvania but was extended even further. Kuritz, \\"The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 1891‚Äì1931\\", Pennsylvania History, July 1962. The coal companies moved aggressively to exploit the law in other ways as well. The Coal and Iron Police patrolled company property and denied admittance to union members and supporters. Union members were often arrested for using public roads which traversed company property.Kuritz, \\"The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 1891‚Äì1931\\", Pennsylvania History, July 1962. Small towns and villages, often encircled by coal company land, became isolated and embattled. In Herminie, all citizens were required to obtain a pass from the local mine manager before leaving the village. Union members were denied the use of post offices or the ability to enter local courthouses, because these facilities were often on coal company property. Nearly 1,000 miners were ultimately arrested for trespass or disorderly conduct. Simply walking home in a group from a union meeting on a public highway could earn a contempt citation and a $50 fine. In 1911, seven coal companies in Westmoreland County and Allegheny County sued the leaders of the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty- eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. But the public outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits. =Use of security personnel= Employers also used force to intimidate striking miners. At their disposal were the Coal and Iron Police, local law enforcement personnel, and the Pennsylvania State Police. *The Coal and Iron Police primarily protected company property, protected strikebreakers, and kept strikebreakers from quitting. But in many ways, their role in the strike was quite limited. *Sheriff's deputies and local police deputies proved to be a much bigger problem. The coal companies paid the Westmoreland County sheriff to provide deputies to protect their property and replacement workers (a common practice at the time). Although the sheriff's deputies would be acting under the color of law, they were paid for and under the control of the coal companies. The Westmoreland County sheriff obtained many deputies through \\"detective agencies\\" notorious of their strikebreaking activities, but nevertheless instructed the deputies to exercise restraint and ignore peaceful marches. He also warned them that he would dismiss deputies who committed acts of violence. Despite this, sheriff's deputies instigated and participated in three particularly violent and deadly incidents: *On May 8, 1910, sheriff's deputies attempted to prevent a handful of strikebreakers from permanently quitting their jobs at the Westmoreland Coal Company in the town of Yukon, Pennsylvania. About four hours after the replacement workers had returned to their boarding house, 25 sheriff's deputies and Pennsylvania state policemen broke into and searched the boarding house. A crowd of striking miners gathered and ridiculed their failure to find the workers. The furious and embarrassed sheriff's deputies then fired into the crowd. Thirty people were injured and one man killed. The Westmoreland County sheriff withdrew the commissions of 18 deputies involved in the incident, but the Westmoreland Coal Company had them sworn in as local police deputies instead. *Shortly after the Yukon incident, a small group of miners walking home from a meeting in Export passed coal company property. A squad of 20 sheriff's deputies and State Police troopers attacked them. Several miners were severely beaten, and one miner (trying to protect a child in his arms) was killed. *In July 1910, striking miners secured a march permit from the town of South Greensburg. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police stepped forward and told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriff's deputies fired into the crowd‚Äîkilling a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriff's office and forced his release. Problems with the deputies were so severe that in November 1910 the Westmoreland County sheriff stopped securing them for the coal companies. The companies responded by seeking deputies from local police forces instead. In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing striking miners as deputy sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for contempt of court for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway. The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways. The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) proved to be the most violent group during the strike. The PSP had been founded in 1905 to discourage the use of private police forces in workers' strikes and to provide law enforcement when local police or sheriffs were unable or unwilling to enforce the law. But rather than enforce the law, the PSP proved the group most willing to break it. One trooper described how the State Police dealt with strikers: \\"We ride in, scoop them up and beat hell out of them.\\"McDonough, \\"Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miner's Strike, 1910‚Äì1911\\", Pennsylvania History, 1997, p. 397. The number of unprovoked violent acts committed by the PSP was extremely high and frequent. James Maurer, a socialist member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from Reading, conducted a survey asking for information on State Police actions during the strike. Maurer's survey found that violence significantly increased after the arrival of the State Police, and that almost all acts of violence were committed by state troopers without provocation. Mauer was so outraged by the results of his survey that he introduced a bill to abolish the state police. Hundreds of citizens later testified before state and federal commissions that mounted State Police routinely charged onto town sidewalks or into crowds, trampling and severely injuring men, women and children (whether strikers or not). Severe beatings with fists and clubs were common, with troopers breaking into and ransacking homes without warrants, beating citizens and striking miners alike. Local police officials claimed State Police routinely beat people on the street for no reason, and resisted local police attempts to stop them. State Police troopers shot up towns \\"in true Western style\\", and fired indiscriminately into crowds or into tent cities (killing and wounding sleeping women and children). Sexual assault (including rape) was disturbingly common, and at least one hotel manager accused troopers of promoting prostitution. State Police were also involved in a number of serious violent incidents, several of which resulted in the deaths of unarmed strikers: *In May 1910, State Police allegedly killed a man in cold blood. Several State Police officers and a coal company executive stopped and questioned four striking miners who did not speak English. An English-speaking miner who spoke their language came on the scene and told the four men to run off. They did so and escaped, but the State Police troopers chased the fifth man into a barn. The miner was shot and killed. The numerous witnesses testified that the miner was begging for his life when a State Trooper shot him. But the other troopers and a coal company executive stated that the miner was killed in self-defense, and the trooper was exonerated. *In May 1911, State Police assaulted a group of striking miners on a public road. The miners, on their way to a meeting, walked past property owned by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The road narrowed where a creek ran past the property. The mounted State Police troopers blocked the mines' path at this point, then charged into the crowd. Two miners were shot and several severely beaten. A Westmoreland County sheriff's deputy accompany the miners was also badly beaten. *In June 1911, miners secured a permit to march past facilities owned by the Penn Gas Coal Company. As the marchers peacefully walked past the company's front gate, State Police opened fire. More than 150 shots were fired, causing panic and several injuries. Westmoreland County sheriff's deputies (all miners) identified three of the troopers and went to Penn Gas Coal Company to arrest them. Instead, Pennsylvania State Police and Coal and Iron Police arrested the deputies for violating the court injunction. A court sentenced the deputies to five days in jail. When the Westmoreland County sheriff refused to put his deputies in jail, the court ordered the sheriff's arrest and charged him with malfeasance. Despite the pleas of a jury, the court sentenced the sheriff to one year and three months in solitary confinement and hard labor. During the strike, six striking miners, nine wives of striking miners, and one bystander were killed, and thousands of strikers and members of their families severely beaten or wounded. End of the strike By mid-1911, the strike had taken its toll on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had been spent on security, and coal production had dropped by 45 percent. The larger companies, however, used their financial reserves and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors. But the miners were worse off than the employers. The winter of 1910‚Äì11 was particularly cold, and the miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners' families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers' families. In early 1911, the UMWA's support for the strikers appeared strong. In January 1911, Lewis lost the presidency of UMWA to John P. White. White fully backed the strike, and the UMWA convention reaffirmed the union's support for the miners. But just six months later, the UMWA called a halt to the strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in strike relief funds, but it was no longer financially able to keep the strike going. On July 1, 1911, the UMWA executive board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania. Women's resistance The Westmoreland County coal strike was the setting for one of the more colorful incidents in the life of Mary Harris Jones, better known as \\"Mother Jones\\". Even though she was 73 years of age, Mother Jones agreed to travel to Westmoreland County to support the United Mine Workers in their strike. =Singing women= A number of miners' wives had been arrested in the summer of 1910 for harassing strikebreakers and company security personnel. Jones encouraged the women to bring their babies and small children with them when they were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no one else to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers. While the women were being processed for imprisonment, Jones instructed them: \\"You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse. Sleep all day and sing all night and don't stop for anyone. Say you're singing to the babies. I will bring the little ones milk and fruit. Just you all sing and sing.\\"Mary Harris Jones: The Autobiography of Mother Jones. 4th ed., 1996. Fortunately, the jail was next door to the sheriff's home, as well as several hotels, lodging houses, and other homes. The sound of women singing all through the night kept most of the townspeople awake. After five days of sleeplessness, the townspeople angrily demanded that the judge order the women's release.

For each season, the franchise used Forepaugh Park as their home field. Before the 1890 season, the PL was founded by the first organized professional sports union, the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players, in an attempt to compete with the existing major leagues, the National League (NL) and the AA.Lewis, Chapter 1 Their intent was to break free from the standard business practices of the two leagues that they claimed stifled players' salaries; such as the reserve clause, and the Brush Classification System, as well as their ability to sell players to another team without the consent of the player. The Quakers were controlled by a group of investors, which included brothers G. W. and J. Earl Wagner.Lewis, Chapter 5 Under the pressure of PL investors, who were seeking recoupment of massive financial losses following the 1890 season, pressured the Brotherhood to compromise with the NL and AA.Lewis, Chapter 6 The deal called for the dissolution of the league, while allowing the players to return to their old teams without penalty, with the reserve clause and the selling of players, without their consent, outlawed.Lewis, Chapter 6Lewis, Chapter 7 The Quakers were allowed entrance into the AA for 1891 season and claimed the nickname of the team they were replacing, the Philadelphia Athletics, who had been expelled for violating the league constitution. Although many players departed for new teams for the 1891 season, including Buffinton, Shindle, and Mike Griffin, they were able to sign suitable replacements, such as Gus Weyhing, Elton Chamberlain, and Pop Corkhill. The team completed the season with a 73‚Äì66 win-loss record, with four ties, placing them fifth among nine teams. Following the 1891 season, the AA could no longer operate due to great financial losses, and were forced to fold, with four teams being consolidated with the NL, and the others accepting buyouts. The Athletics fell into the latter group, and ceased operations. Pitcher Bert Cunningham set a dubious record when he threw five wild pitches in one inning on Sept. 15, 1890, a record that would go unmatched for 110 years until Rick Ankiel tied it in a playoff game.

He was president of the Manitoba Teachers Society, and chaired the Winnipeg School Board on two separate occasions. Early life and political career Kowalchuk grew up in Sandy Lake, Manitoba, attended Normal School in Winnipeg, and spent one year in the military at the end of World War II. He began his teaching career in 1946, and later received Bachelor of Education degrees from the University of Manitoba. He campaigned for a seat on the Winnipeg City Council in 1974 and 1977, but was defeated both times. He was elected as a trustee on the Winnipeg School Division No. 1 in 1983 and served until 1995, when he chose not to seek re- election. A man named \\"Ed Kowalchuk\\" sought the provincial New Democratic Party nomination for Burrows in the buildup to the 1988 provincial election, losing to Doug Martindale. It is not clear if this was the same person. Views Kowalchuk supported the creation of aboriginal schools in Winnipeg, as a means of promoting native self-improvement. He supported a zero-tolerance policy against violence, and opposed budget cuts that reduced the number of counsellors and special-needs educators.Aldo Santin, \\"Violent kids may be out\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 February 1994; David Kuxhaus, \\"Board spares nursery school\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 May 1994.

The Kingdom of Viguera (Basque: Viguerako Erresuma) was a small ephemeral kingdom centered on the town of Viguera from 970 to 1005. The kingdom was created by King Garc√≠a S√°nchez I of Pamplona for the eldest son of his second marriage, Ramiro Garc√©s, who became the first king of Viguera. The kingdom was carved out of the south of the Kingdom of Pamplona. Its territory encompassed the valleys of the Iregua and Leza rivers in the heartland of the present-day Rioja. It probably also included Meltria. It was an artificial creation, lacking ethnic or geographical distinctness. The kings of Viguera were always subject to their superiors ruling in Pamplona. After 1005, the territory ceased to be a separate kingdom and became just another tenancy of the crown. In the year 918 Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n and Sancho I of Pamplona invaded Viguera to clear out the Banu Qasi dynasty from the land. By 923, the area had been subdued and fortified. From 924 and until the year 972 the land around Viguera was ruled by Fort√∫n Gal√≠ndez, who had the title of Duke of Viguera. Garc√≠a S√°nchez I of Pamplona, left as heir to the Kingdom of Pamplona his first son by his first marriage, Sancho II. After the insistence of his second wife, Teresa of Le√≥n, Garc√≠a I willed Viguera to his first son with her, Ramiro Garc√©s. After the death of Garc√≠a I, his son Sancho II, acting as King of Pamplona, recognised his half-brother's rights over Viguera. Ramiro was succeeded in the throne by his son, Sancho Ram√≠rez in 991. Sancho's brother, Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez acted as co-king prior to his brother's death in 1002 or shortly thereafter. Garc√≠a left only daughters and simply disappears from the historical record between 1005 and 1030. Later on Viguera appears again as being part of the Kingdom of Pamplona.

History The first Europeans to settle the area that would eventually become Amity Township were Thomas N. Reynolds, Samuel K. Reynolds, and E. Breckinridge, arriving together in 1833. The area was attractive to early settlers for its abundance of timber, stone, and water. They built small cabins for their families and lived in them for several years on what was known by 1878 as the J.P. Houston farm.‚ÄúAmity Township.‚Äù.

The state park is named for Wayne Fitzgerrell, a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from nearby Wayne County in the 70th through 74th General Assemblies. Fitzgerrell had been one of the local leaders who had called for the damming of the Big Muddy River and creation of Rend Lake. Wayne Fitzgerrell was originally dedicated as a state park but changed its name in the 1990s to reflect its identity as a space managed for sportsmen. 1,000 acres (4.0 km¬≤) of the park is consciously managed for the hunting of deer, upland birds such as pheasants, and small game.

Their unique sound incorporated sampled ethnic instruments, two drummers, two bassists, and featured angry but humorous lyrics. Biography The group started in 1989, when Adam Tanner and John Carson, burned out from failed rock bands, decided to make music for films, and bought 2 Akai S-950 samplers. Having technical difficulties, they asked their friend Lars Fox to help figure out how to use them, and Fox asserted himself as their singer. Their first songs came quickly, and the trio headed to Dancing Dog Studio in Emeryville, to record with David Bryson (soon to be a member of Counting Crows). A visit to radio station KUSF's local music show yielded an invitation to perform at a showcase within a few weeks of starting. They developed a large dedicated following in San Francisco over the next two years, playing with their friends in Consolidated often, and opening for touring industrial bands, including Nine Inch Nails. New local record label Spirit Music Industries asked them to put out a recording, resulting in Brown, introducing the group's ethnic industrial stylings. Next, the group added drummer Bruce Boyd (formerly of Pagan Babies) to the mix, resulting in a more organic punk feel. The new line up released Luddite on Spirit, much more a live band now, as opposed to Brown's more classic industrial sequenced machine grooves. Faith No More and Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton championed the band, asking them to open for his band Mr Bungle, joining them for the band's first US tour, in 1992. This led to Alternative Tentacles' Jello Biafra asking the band to join their roster, which they did, releasing what many fans feel to be their best work, Slow Motion Apocalypse, in 1993. Grotus toured relentlessly from 1993 to 1996, stopping only to record, essentially living in their van or rehearsal space. Many major labels were signing alternative bands in the early post- Nirvana era and were soon sought out. They eventually signed with London Records. London released the more rock oriented Mass in 1996, with a remix EP (\\"Handjob\\") being released as a touring device in 1995 (for a tour with Korn, on their first headlining tour). London was primarily interested in the atypical (for Grotus) song \\"Hand to Mouth\\", but when it failed to catch on as a single, the label dropped the band two months later after Mass' release. After seven years of activity, the band decided to call it quits and disbanded. Lars Fox has since produced many releases and continues to do so. Fox has become a specialized recording engineer \\"track surgeon\\" working on artists ranging from Nick Cave to Ashlee Simpson. He is best known for co- producing Everclear's last four albums. Tanner, a bluegrass enthusiast, tours around the U.S. and Europe playing mandolin, fiddle and guitar in various groups. Boyd moved to the desert, and is metal director and D.J. at KZMU, in Moab, Utah. Carson lives in Portland, Oregon and works for a musical instrument manufacturer as an electronic technician. His band TV616 disbanded in August 2006. Their last show was in Sabalas, Portland.  Musical style  Projected videos, synchronized with the music, were an important part of the band from the beginning, influencing and being influenced by other Bay Area bands including Neurosis and Consolidated. Their shows included large projected videos sequenced with the songs, and could almost qualify as performance art, with lyrics channeling any number of issues involved in the subjects of the videos. Many of the songs had a level of social commentary and in particular dealt with anger at environmental collapse. The group's sound can be summarized as industrial, experimental and alternative rock (later) with elements of ethnic music via sampling and to a lesser extent, metal.

Early life Zhang Peilun was born in Hangzhou on November 24, 1848. His father, Zhang Yintang (ÂºµÂç∞Â°ò, 1797‚Äì1854), was a mid-level government official who died when Zhang Peilun was only a child, which left the family in genteel poverty. Zhang was, by all reports, a bright and studious child. After passing the provincial imperial examination at age 23 and the metropolitan one at 24, he came under the tutelage of Li Hongzao and quickly rose to prominence. Political Views Zhang was one of the foremost members of the so-called Purist Party (Ê∏ÖÊµÅÈª®) led by Zhang Zhidong, an extremist group which urged resistance to French encroachment in north Vietnam in the early 1880s, even at the cost of war with France, in opposition to the more moderate stance advocated by Li Hongzhang and his supporters. Battle of Fuzhou Shortly before the outbreak of the Sino-French War, Zhang was appointed imperial commissioner, with responsibility for the defense of Fujian province. His Fujian Fleet was defeated and almost annihilated by the French Far East Squadron, under the command of Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet, at the Battle of Fuzhou (23 August 1884).Lung Chang, 280 Zhang had made no serious attempt to coordinate the resistance of the Fujian fleet, and was demoted by the Empress Dowager Cixi on 19 September 1884 and replaced as Fujian defense commissioner by the veteran general Zuo Zongtang.Lung Chang, 281 He was then exiled to serve as a soldier in Zhangjiakou, a rural town in Northeast China. Return from exile After returning to Beijing/Tianjin in 1888, Zhang managed to find work as a secretary/scribe for his former political enemy, Li Hongzhang.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/CHANG_P'EI-LUN.html Reportedly, Li was so impressed with Zhang that he encouraged his eldest daughter, Li Ju‚Äôou (ÊùéËèäËóï, 1866‚Äì1912), marry to Zhang, despite the couple's disparate ages and opposition from Li Ju‚Äôou's mother. Nonetheless, Li Hongzhang still refused to help Zhang enter public life again and Zhang devoted himself to his literary ambitions instead. He and his family moved to Nanjing after the wedding and Zhang, with the help of his wife, began editing the various works that he had begun writing while in exile. The couple eventually co-wrote a cookbook and a martial arts novel. In 1903, Zhang died in Nanjing at the age of 56 due to an unspecified liver disease. His wife died nine years later and they were buried together. Their graves were exhumed and desecrated during the Cultural Revolution five decades later. Family Zhang married a total of three times and had three sons and a daughter. He and his first wife, Zhu Zhixiang (Êú±Ëä∑Ëñå, d.1879) had two sons together, Zhang Zhicang (ÂºµÂøóÊªÑ, who died young) and Zhang Zhiqian (ÂºµÂøóÊΩõ, b. circa 1879). After the death of his first wife, he eventually remarried, but his second wife, Bian Cuiyu (ÈÇäÁ≤πÁéâ, d.1886), died while he was in exile. In 1888 he married Li Ju‚Äòou. His third marriage was reportedly a happy one and produced a son and a daughter, Zhang Zhiyi (ÂºµÂøóÊ≤Ç, 1896‚Äì1953) and Zhang Maoyuan (ÂºµËåÇÊ∑µ, 1898‚Äì1991).

Power was ordained to the priesthood in Queanbeyan on 17 July 1965 and served in the parishes of Braidwood, Canberra and Goulburn before being asked by Archbishop Thomas Cahill to undertake a doctorate in canon law in 1972 at the Propaganda Fide College, Rome. On the completion of his studies in 1975, Power returned to Canberra and for 10 years served as archbishop's secretary (to three archbishops) and director of the marriage tribunal. In February 1985, Power became parish priest of his home parish of Queanbeyan. Episcopate On 18 April 1986, he was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Francis Carroll in St Christopher's Cathedral, Canberra, becoming the fifth Auxiliary Bishop of Canberra‚ÄìGoulburn. Since that time he served on bishops' committees for laity, ecumenism, canon law, family and life, social welfare and media. He has also been the Secretary of the Committee for Justice, Development, Ecology and Peace and a member of the Australian Social Justice Council. Much of his ministry has been in the field of ecumenical and inter-faith relations. He was the first Catholic co-chairman of AUSTARC, the national Anglican-Roman Catholic dialogue. He served a number of terms as chair of the ACT Churches Council. At the 1998 Oceania Synod of Bishops in Rome, Power spoke on marginalised people in society and in the church. Much of his efforts have been directed in this area through Catholic Welfare Australia and through local community organizations in Canberra. He has been a strong advocate for the East Timorese and the Palestinian people, for Aboriginal people, for racial respect, for the unemployed and in opposition to abortion and assisted suicide. In 2000, Power chaired a major enquiry into poverty in the Australian Capital Territory. He supported the move to have the South Sydney Rabbitohs restored to the national rugby league competition. Power has said that the church has \\"retreated from the promising outcomes\\" of the Second Vatican Council. In a 2010 article, he said that issues such as priestly celibacy, church teaching on sexuality and the role of women in the church must be discussed with Catholic lay people. He often expressed support for the ordination of married men. His early resignation, at age 70, as auxiliary bishop of Canberra and Goulburn was effective from 7 June 2012. He stated that the Vatican's \\"inability to listen\\" and the problems of clergy sex abuse and the shortage of priests are the \\"most vexing issues\\" facing the church.

Training and life Nunberg earned his medical degree in 1910 from the University of Zurich, where he assisted Carl Gustav Jung at the Burgh√∂lzli Psychiatric Clinic with word association tests. For a short time he practised psychiatry in Schaffhausen and Bern, and in 1912 he taught classes at the university clinic in Krakow. In 1914 he became an assistant to Julius Wagner-Jauregg in Vienna, where for several years he taught classes on neurology, and where in 1915 he joined the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. He remained in Vienna until 1932 when he emigrated to the United States and worked in Philadelphia and New York City. While in New York he was a member of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, of which he was president from 1950 until 1952.

The scoring makes a split in the surface of the glass which encourages the glass to break along the score. Regular, annealed glass can be broken apart this way but not tempered glass as the latter tends to shatter rather than breaking cleanly into two pieces. A glass cutter may use a diamond to create the split, but more commonly a small cutting wheel made of hardened steel or tungsten carbide 4‚Äì6 mm in diameter with a V-shaped profile called a \\"hone angle\\" is used. The greater the hone angle of the wheel, the sharper the angle of the V and the thicker the piece of glass it is designed to cut. The hone angle on most hand-held glass cutters is 120¬∞, though wheels are made as sharp as 154¬∞ for cutting glass as thick as . Their main drawback is that wheels with sharper hone angles will become dull more quickly than their more obtuse counterparts. The effective cutting of glass also requires a small amount of oil (kerosene is often used) and some glass cutters contain a reservoir of this oil which both lubricates the wheel and prevents it from becoming too hot: as the wheel scores, friction between it and the glass surface briefly generates intense heat, and oil dissipates this efficiently. When properly lubricated a steel wheel can give a long period of satisfactory service. However, tungsten carbide wheels have been proven to have a significantly longer life than steel wheels and offer greater and more reproducible penetration in scoring as well as easier opening of the scored glass. In the Middle Ages, glass was cut with a heated and sharply pointed iron rod. The red hot point was drawn along the moistened surface of the glass causing it to snap apart. Fractures created in this way were not very accurate and the rough pieces had to be chipped or \\"grozed\\" down to more exact shapes with a hooked tool called a grozing iron. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, starting in Italy, a diamond-tipped cutter became prevalent which allowed for more precise cutting. Then in 1869 the wheel cutter was developed by Samuel Monce of Bristol, Connecticut, which remains the current standard tool for most glass cutting. Large sheets of glass are usually cut with a computer- assisted CNC semi-automatic glass cutting table. These sheets are then broken out by hand into the individual sheets of glass (also known as \\"lites\\" in the glass industry). Cutting process Glass cutters are manufactured with wheels of varying diameters. One of the most popular has a diameter of 5.5 mm ( in). The ratio between the arc of the wheel and the pressure applied with the tool has an important bearing on the degree of penetration. Average hand pressure with this size wheel often gives good results. For a duller wheel on soft glass a larger wheel (e.g., 6 mm ( in) will require no change in hand pressure. A smaller wheel (3 mm ( in)) is appropriate for cutting patterns and curves since a smaller wheel can follow curved lines without dragging. The sheet of glass is typically lubricated along the cutting line with a light oil. The cutter is then pressed firmly against the surface of glass and a line is briskly scribed to form a \\"score\\" or \\"cut\\". The glass is now weakened along this line and the panel is ready to be split. Running pliers may then be used to \\"run\\" or \\"open\\" to the split. General purpose glass is mostly made by the float glass process and is obtainable in thicknesses from 1.5 to 25 mm ( to 1 in). Thin float glass tends to cut easily with a sharp cutter. Thicker glass such as 10 mm ( in)) float glass is significantly more difficult to cut and break; glass with textured or patterned surfaces may demand specialized methods for scoring and opening the cuts.

The Centre was founded in 1946, and began the first architectural school in Wellington (1947) and the first town planning school in New Zealand (1949). The Centre was unique at the time of its founding in that it invited members interested in a broad range of design and the arts, rather than restricting membership to professional architects and architectural students. Internationally it is one of the oldest organisations of its type.  Philosophy and Scope  The Centre began the two-monthly publication of Design Review in 1948. The journal addressed design topics as broad as furniture, town planning, theatre and stage design, packaging, church design, book- binding, poster design, industrial design and of course architecture. It hence reflected the Centre's interest in architecture, design and the arts in the broadest sense and was the first journal of its kind in New Zealand. The editorial of April/May 1949 explicitly asked the question \\"What is Design Review?\\" answering this by stating that: \\"Like everything that has to do with the arts, design cannot be tested for its quality in a laboratory ... The elusive quality that a consensus of opinion agrees to call good design is not to be defined in terms like an axiom in geometry ... So we will leave the making of formulas and rules to those who like that sort of thing ... we shall publish in each number a discussion on some particular object; a house, a chair, a teapot or what have you. The contributor will tell you his or her opinion about the merits or demerits of the way that thing is designed, omitting any waving of the big stick to lay down laws of design. It is for you to decide if you think they are right.\\"  Contributors  Contributors included Doreen Blumhardt, Helen Hitchings, E.H. McCormick, Odo Strewe, William Toomath, Gordon F. Wilson, Anna Plischke, film maker John O'Shea, writer Alan Mulgan, and photographers John Pascoe and Irene Koppel. Editors of the journal included architects Ernst Plischke, Maurice Patience, and Al Gabites, and well-known artists E. Mervyn Taylor, and Eric Lee-Johnson. The final issue of Design Review was in 1954.

His brother, William Wirt Adams, also was a Confederate Army brigadier general. The family moved to Mississippi in 1825.According to Eicher, 2001, p. 99, Adams was educated at the University of Virginia. Other sources for this article do not mention his education at the University of Virginia. Adams read law and became a lawyer in Mississippi. He also was a second lieutenant in the Mississippi militia and a member of the Mississippi legislature. Adams killed, in a duel, June 6, 1843 the newspaper \\"Vicksburg Sentinel\\" editor James Hagan who had criticized his father.Warner says that Adams's father was a federal judge. Eicher, 2001, p. 99 says Adams killed a federal judge who had criticized his father's newspaper. Adams moved to New Orleans, Louisiana in 1852. He became prominent in local political and social circles, and his practice became one of the city's largest. Civil War With the secession of Louisiana following the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, in early 1861 Louisiana Governor Thomas O. Moore appointed Adams a member of the military board created to prepare the state for war. Adams was later appointed a lieutenant colonel of the 1st Louisiana Regulars, or 1st Louisiana Infantry, in the Confederate Army, and was promoted to the rank of colonel on October 30, 1861 after the regiment was sent to Pensacola, Florida. When his regiment's brigade commander, Brigadier General Adley H. Gladden was killed on the first day of the Battle of Shiloh, Adams assumed command of the brigade. Soon thereafter, Adams was wounded in further fighting at the Hornet's Nest. A bullet hit Adams just above his left eye and exited behind the left ear, severing the optic nerve and leaving him blinded in the left eye.Sifakis, 1988, p. 3. Adams was put in an ambulance wagon, but had become unresponsive, so the driver assumed he was dead and threw him overboard to lighten the load.Welsh, Jack D.

Adams was saved when passing soldiers of the 10th Mississippi Infantry Regiment found him and realized that he was still alive. After a month of recuperating in an army hospital in Corinth, he was able to resume his duties. Adams was promoted to brigadier general on May 23. 1862. He led his brigade at the battles of PerryvilleEicher, 2001, p. 99 shows Adams as wounded at Perryville but the other sources do not. and Stones River. He was wounded again, in the left arm, at Stones River on December 31, 1862. Adams returned to duty in early 1863 and led his brigade at the siege of Jackson, Mississippi under General Joseph E. Johnston. Under the command of General Braxton Bragg, Adams's brigade fought at the Chickamauga. Adams's brigade broke through the Union lines on the second day of the battle but they were driven back by Union Army reinforcements. Adams was again wounded, in the left arm, and captured. When he recovered sufficiently to return to duty and was exchanged, Adams briefly commanded a cavalry brigade. He subsequently was made the commander of the District of Central Alabama in 1864, and the commander of the State of Alabama, North of Gulf Department in 1865. Although he sought a promotion to major general, he remained a brigadier general until the end of the war. He took part in the Battle of Selma in 1865, and the Battle of Columbus, Georgia, that same year. Adams surrendered to Union forces in Meridian, Mississippi on May 9 and took the oath of allegiance to the United States. Postbellum career After the war ended, Adams spent some time in England, then returned to New Orleans to practice law along with Harry T. Hays, a fellow Confederate general. Adams lived for a time in New York City where he was involved in the real estate business before moving back to New Orleans to resume his law practice and engage in state politics. He died in his office of a massive stroke on June 13, 1872. Daniel Weisiger Adams is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi next to his brother William Wirt Adams. Daniel Weisiger Adams's gravesite is unmarked but ironically there is a cenotaph tombstone for him in Greenwood's Confederate Section.Find a Grave mentions a cenotaph but states it is unmarked. On October 24, 2013 the Find a Grave web page for Daniel Weisiger Adams has two pictures of a tombstone for Weisiger. In one of the pictures in particular, the marker appears to be rather new. Photo The photograph labeled as \\"D.W. Adams\\" in Francis Miller's Photograph History of the Civil War Volume X (which also appears in Find A Grave) is incorrect; it is that of his brother W.W.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Bernard Cornwell, though it is set a year later (1813) than the book. Plot On the French-Spanish frontier, a French patrol led by a colonel of Napoleon's Imperial Guard overtakes a carriage containing a priest and three nuns. The priest is the confessor of El Mirador, Wellington's best secret agent; he is tortured into revealing the spy's identity. Then, he and two of the nuns are killed, but the youngest (Emily Mortimer), a novice, gets away. Major Sharpe (Sean Bean) and his riflemen show up and rout the French, taking a captain captive, while the colonel is killed. Sharpe finds a piece of paper filled with cryptic numbers on the prisoner and suspects that his captive is actually the colonel in disguise. However, he is unable to convince his superior, nor his fellow officer, Captain Jack Spears (James Purefoy); the Frenchman is allowed to give his parole and is not imprisoned. The young woman (referred to simply as \\"the Lass\\"), having lost her faith and being rendered mute by the horror she has witnessed, attaches herself to Sharpe. Back at camp, Wellington's spymaster, Major Mungo Munro (Hugh Ross), has received word that Napoleon himself has sent Colonel Leroux (Patrick Fierry) of the elite Imperial Guard to capture El Mirador. Munro assigns Sharpe the task of killing the colonel, but refuses to divulge the spy's identity. He sends Sharpe and the South Essex Regiment to the town where El Mirador is based. The British already control the place, but there is a French-held fort close by. When the men near the town, a surprise artillery barrage (rendered extra-surprising by the use of exploding roundshot) from the fort causes enough confusion to allow the prisoner, who is in fact Leroux, to break his parole and escape to its safety. Sharpe meets two people, his old enemy Sir Henry Simmerson (Michael Cochrane), now the British representative to the town, and Father Curtis, an Irish priest (John Kavanagh), who runs the hospital. The regiment attacks that night, but the French have been forewarned and the assault is bloodily repulsed. Berkeley is killed at the outbreak of the battle, leaving Sharpe in charge. As Sharpe gains the top of the wall, he is faced by a counterattack led by the escaped French colonel. After a duel, Sharpe is not only physically wounded, but demoralised at the loss of his sword. While he recovers, he sends for British artillery and orders his most literate rifleman, Harris (Jason Salkey), to decode the message he took from Leroux. During this time, the woman regains her voice and her faith as Sharpe convalesces. In addition, Patrick Harper makes a deal with the father and promises to get the woman back to the church as well as himself in exchange for a new sword for Sharpe. The new sword revitalizes the wounded Sharpe. Harris succeeds in breaking the code. The message unmasks Spears as a traitor (he had been taken captive, tortured, and then blackmailed by Leroux). However, Spears is unable to bring himself to kill El Mirador, who is revealed to be Father Curtis. When the cannon arrives, Sharpe gives the officer the opportunity for an honourable death. After the fort is softened up by an artillery barrage, Spears charges singlehanded and plants a British flag at the fort's entrance, rousing the morale of the British soldiers, but is killed shortly after. Sharpe and the South Essex then storm the fort. When Leroux tries to surrender, Sharpe offers him a duel to the death instead; if he kills Sharpe, he can go free. Sharpe wins. Taking advantage of Sharpe's absence, Simmerson attempts to rape the novice (who had humiliated him earlier when he had made a crude advance), but is stopped by Father Curtis. The priest accuses Simmerson of warning the French of the first attack; when Simmerson advances on him with sword drawn, Father Curtis, an ex-soldier, unexpectedly draws his own and teaches him a very painful lesson. Differences from the novel The plot of this episode diverges from the novel in a number of substantial ways, particularly concerning some of the main characters. * The Marchesa was written out of the episode and instead used, albeit in a completely different role, in Sharpe's Honour. She is Colonel Leroux's sister in the book. Her part in betraying the British is played by Sir Henry Simmerson, who doesn't appear in the novel. * The character of Jack Spears was made much more sympathetic in the film. In the book, he is a gambler who lost all of his fortune at the table and is corrupted by Leroux, while in the TV movie he succumbs to the French colonel's tortures. He dies as a hero in both the novel and the film, but in the former he is not urged to do so by Sharpe, who discovers the nobleman's betrayal only while he is already dying. * Some characters, notably \\"Lass\\" and Major Monroe, were created for the TV movie and do not appear in the novel at all. * Although Sergeant Harper's love for a Spanish girl is mentioned in the novel, the girl is called Isabella (not Ramona, who is a TV character only) and they do not marry. Harper is wounded both in the movie and in the novel, but in the latter his wound is much worse. Both Sharpe and Harper are wounded while trying to stop Leroux from escaping, as opposed to during the assault to the fort (which is only one in the movie, while there were three forts in the novel). * In the novel the Battle of Salamanca is the climax of the story. Richard Sharpe takes part in the famous charge of the KGL cavalry at Garcia Hernandez and breaks French infantry squares. None of this is shown in the TV film, which ends with the attack on the Salamanca forts. It is to be assumed the TV film did not show the full battle due to the numbers required and the difficulty of portraying a full cavalry charge on this scale.

At his sojourn in Sonari, Kamlaji who was an ardent devotee of Lord Bhairava, would secure his cattle in a pen and visit the Lord's temple. He would perform the deity's ablutions, decorate the deity with flowers and leaves from the tarwad shrub. After offering obeisance, Kamlaji would offer a piece of his bhakri to the god. This had become a ritual for Kamlaji. Later ahead in Borban, Kamlaji would secure the cattle in a barn. Find a quiet place to meditate and travel astrally to worship his deity at Sonari, thus continuing his worship without interruptions. After the worship Kamlaji would return to his place of meditation at dawn. This too had become a part of his worship. Eventually, the residents of Sonari village took notice of the fact that someone visited their deity at night and the dawn. Determined to track who this unknown visitor was, the villagers set up a night watch. Unaware, of this happening, Kamlaji got ready to set for journey to Sonari. At that moment, Lord Bhairava intervened and forbade Kamlaji from visiting Sonari and its temple, fearing that the villagers would harm his beloved devotee. However, Kamlaji who was austere in his worship, replied that he would rather die at the lords feet from the beatings of the villagers than skip worship. The lord was in a dilemma and requested Kamlaji to stay away from the temple and that he, the lord would himself come to visit Kamlaji. To which Kamlaji asked, how would he know the lord has visited? The lord told Kamlaji that a barren, old tree would sprout green new leaves to mark his arrival. Thus convinced Kamlaji decided to stay back and do as the lord suggested. Kamlaji waited till nightfall for the lord to appear, but the lord did not appear. Restless by now, Kamlaji decided to proceed to the village temple and perform worship. No sooner than Kamlaji decided to leave, a huge snakes with 5 heads appeared amongst the cows. The giant snake coiled around an infertile cow, which then started producing milk and with four of its heads, the snake suckled the cows milk while the fifth head swayed vigilant and majestic in the air. Kamlaji darted towards the barn to see what had scared the other cows. Kamlaji was terrified by what he saw, and began wondering if it was the lord who had arrived as promised. When he turned his attention to a nearby barren tree, the tree miraculously sprouted leaves. Taking this as the cue, Kamlaji quickly offered his turban as a seat for the lord. To which the lord gladly obliged. Kamlaji then proceeded to perform his worship ritual. This association of the lord and Kamlaji remained inconspicuous for 12 years. However, one fine day a villager sneaked into the barn and witnessed this peculiar event. He then ran and tattled the secret to Kamlaji's father. Worried that his son had sought to blackmagic and was petting a giant snake, Kamlaji's father confronted him. Perplexed by the question and unable to decide if he should deride the lord by calling him a pet, or lie to his father about his worship ritual, Kamlaji remained silent. Later on Kamlaji approached the lord for a solution, to which the lord advised Kamlaji to put his snake form in a mound with a hole in it. Kamlaji did as the lord suggested and later convinced his parents that there is nothing unusual happening. Incidentally the mound happened to be in the field of a Raut Mali, who intended to toil his fertile field and reap a rich harvest of crops. Armed with a till and 12 bulls, the field owner asked a toiler and his accomplice to start toiling the field. Kamlaji requested Raut Mali to toil the field but leave the sacred mound untouched. Raut Mali arrogantly refused to pay heed to Kamlaji's word and ordered the field to be tilled. This angered the lord and within a trice the 12 bulls and 4 sons of Kamlaji fell dead on the ground. One of the son who manage to escape screamed and gathered the villagers. Soon the Police was summoned to investigate the matter. However, when the policemen arrived on the spot they found beheaded goats instead of 4 sons. At that instance the spirit of the lord possessed Kamlaji and spoke to villagers and policeman, it announced that Kamlaji was a beloved devotee of himself and that the villagers has brought upon the wrath of the lord by not listening to Kamlaji. However, since Kamlaji did not even hesitate to sacrifice his own sons to the lord, the lord was pleased and agreed to restore their lives. The lineage of these 5 sons are well known today as Shingade, Tarde, Burungale, Vhatkar and Dhawan. Further pleased by Kamlaji's devotions, the lord promised to dwell in the Veer Village henceforth. Thus the lord Mhaskoba and incarnation of bhairav came to be worshiped by the villagers and other folks all around Maharashtra. Further ahead of Kamlaji's time, yet another ardent devotee called \\"Tulaji Badade Patil\\" from Kodit Budruk village, of Purandhar Taluka, Pune district earned the blessings of Mhaskoba Maharaj. As a result, his village is always venered during the annual veer Mhaskoba Maharaj pilgrimage, held every February (Magh Pournima).

She was present at the Battle of Fuzhou on 23 August 1884, the opening engagement of the Sino-French War, where the Chinese fleet was defeated by the French Far East Squadron. She was later converted to a receiving hulk, and back into an armed transport. Design Fu Po was the lead ship of a class of six armed transports built by the Imperial Chinese Navy at the Foochow Arsenal shipyard between 1870 and 1876. They were part of the first home built Western-style navy; which consisted of wooden hulls. The shipyard was overseen by Imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen but led by staff from Western nations, who advised the Chinese to continue building wooden- hulled ships despite them being made obsolete by the construction of ironclads by those nations. Chinese officials would later blame the French, in particular Prosper Giquel, for purposely providing them with out-of-date equipment and designs. She displaced and measured long overall, with a beam of and an average draft of . The propulsion system consisted of a produced by a compound-expansion steam engine with a single shaft, enabling a cruising speed of . Upon launch, her main armament was a single gun and four 40-pounder guns. However, during her career, her armament varied: it was often supplied by the province to which she was assigned rather than by a central organization. For example, when later assigned to Formosa (now Taiwan), her armament was swapped out for six 68-pounder guns. Career Fu Po was the fourth vessel launched from the Foochow Arsenal, on 22 December 1870. She remained based out of Foochow until 1884 as part of the Fujian Fleet under Zhang Peilun, where she was present for the Battle of Fuzhou on 23 August, the opening engagement of the Sino-French War. At the battle, the Chinese fleet were split into a northern and southern squadron opposing the French Far East Squadron under Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet; Fu Po was part of the northern squadron with the flagship , three other large ships, and several gunboats. Upon the opening of the battle, the French squadron targeted the northern squadron, destroying Yangwu in the opening moments. Fu Po fled the battle, steaming up river and eventually beaching herself. As a result, she was the only surviving vessel from the northern squadron. Following the battle, she was re-floated and refitted, before being transferred to operate out of Formosa. In 1890, she was converted into a receiving hulk as accommodation for sailors awaiting assignment. In response to the threat of piracy, the request of the Viceroy of the Two Guangs, by 1893, she had been reconverted to a transport once again and operated out of several locations, including Canton (now Guangzhou).

Early life Brown was the son of James Brown, a farmer, and his wife Sophia Jane, n√©e Torr, and was born at Mintaro, South Australia. Brown was educated at Stanley Grammar School, Watervale, South Australia, and taught for a while at Moonta Mines State School. He then studied at St John's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1890 with a double first class in the law tripos. He was called to the bar of the Middle Temple in 1891 and elected Macmahon student at St John's College in 1892. Law career In 1893 Brown was appointed professor of law and modern history at the University of Tasmania and held this position until 1900 (apart from 1898 when he acted as professor of law in the University of Sydney). In 1898 he published as a pamphlet Why Federate, which had been read before the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. It was a crucial year for the cause of Federation, and Brown did good service in pointing out that the difficulties were mostly of a mechanical character. In 1899 appeared his thoughtful study The New Democracy, and in 1900 he left Australia to become professor of constitutional law and history at University College London. In the following year he was appointed professor of comparative law at the University College of Wales. He was examiner for the Cambridge law tripos 1902‚Äì1905, and for the University of London from 1905‚Äì1906. In 1906 he became professor of law at the University of Adelaide, holding the position for 10 years. His The Austinian Theory of Law, an edition with critical notes and excursus of lectures I, V and VI of Austin's Jurisprudence and of his Essay on the Uses of the Study of Jurisprudence, was published in 1906 and was reprinted several times. In 1912 he published The Underlying Principles of Modern Legislation, which was welcomed as a real contribution to political thought; a fifth edition appeared in April 1917. In this volume Brown points out that the likelihood of greatly increased state activity in the future throws a great responsibility on the teacher and the brains and character of the community; and that problems will arise that will demand enlightened statesmanship no less than reforming zeal. Brown did not attempt to set out his own views on the settlements of particular problems. The book was planned as a university textbook, and he held that the writer in a book of that kind \\"ought to be careful in expressing personal opinions about problems of which the precise solution is very debatable\\". Next appeared the volume The Prevention and Control of Monopolies, where he is more constructive, but always endeavours to hold the scales evenly. He was appointed president of the industrial court of South Australia in 1916 and showed great industry, courtesy and ability in carrying out his duties. His experiences as chairman of the sugar commission in 1912‚Äì14 and on other occasions as chairman of the price regulations commission, the foodstuffs commission, and the gas commission, enabled. him to gain much knowledge of the conditions in industry. Late life and legacy Brown's health began to fail and in July 1927 he resigned his position. He died at Adelaide of pneumonia on 27 May 1930. Brown held the LLD. degree of the University of Cambridge, and received the degree of Litt. D. from the University of Dublin for his The New Democracy. Brown married Aim√©e Loth in 1900 who survived him with a son, the marriage was a dismal one. Brown also contributed a long essay \\"The Judicial Regulation of Industrial Conditions\\" to Australia, Economic and Political Studies, edited by Meredith Atkinson. He also wrote largely for the reviews, including the Law Quarterly Review, the Hibbert Journal, the International Journal of Ethics, the Westminster Review, the Independent Review, the Juridical Review, the Columbia Law Review and the Yale Law Journal.

Together with the brothers of his community who were assassinated, Brother Miguel √Ångel Isla Lucio, Brother Servando Mayor Garc√≠a, and Brother Julio Rodr√≠guez Jorge. Brother Fernando is commemorated in Marist circles as one of The Martyrs of Bugobe. Early life and works Born to Sigismundo and Primitiva de la Fuente de la Fuente in Burgos, Spain, he became a teacher in Chile after taking his first vows on 2 July 1962. He had also worked as a formator and a member of the Chilean Provincial council. Life in Zaire The Marist Brothers had had a strong presence in east-central Africa, particularly Rwanda, where they had been 1952. However, with the Rwandan genocide in 1994, in August 1994, the General Assembly and the District Council of the Brothers of Rwanda took the decision to have a renewed presence among the Rwandans to assist in the nation's rebuilding. Within the country, three communities which centred their mission on the schools were reopened. Six Brothers formed a new community at the service of the refugees outside the country. In view of the escalating difficulties faced by the refugees and the Rwandan Brothers themselves, the community was reinforced with three non-African Brothers. But as the inter- racial tensions persisted, it was decided to withdraw the Rwandan Brothers from the Bugobe community. To aid the mission of the Rwandan Brothers, Brother Fernando offered to participate as an expression of missionary solidarity. He was accepted and left in December 1995 to serve the mission. After two months in Belgium, at the Centre for the Formation of French-speaking Missionaries, he went to Zaire, to the refugee camp of Nyamirangwe (Bugobe), in February 1996. Assassination The brothers were assassinated on 31 October 1996 around eight o'clock in the evening. They were apparently shot. The perpetrators of the crime were a group of the Officers of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (APR), who murdered the Archbishop Christophe Munzihirwa two days before and the Rwandan and Burundian refugees in the refugee camp Nyamirangwe. The four bodies were recovered from the waste-water tank on 14 November and have been interred at the brothers' novitiate house in Nyangezi.

Therefore, the purpose of this Atlas is to enable citizens, students and scholars the opportunity to compare the development of political aspirations and discern social movements over the last 150 years with maps of each of the 21 redistributions and 53 elections held in that time. There are many ways to tell the story of responsible government in New South Wales. The approach taken in The Electoral Atlas of New South Wales is to tell the story through the history of the State's electoral boundaries, electoral systems and election results. The Atlas illuminates 150 years of Responsible Government by examining the historical and political geography of the State and illustrates our changing political State and demonstrates the linkages between traditional politics, social movements and historical events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. An easy to follow format, consistent map presentation and the use of simple colouring schemes will allow the casual reader to quickly understand the ebbs and flows of the State's politics since 1856.

Atlas Introduction - Broadening the Franchise  The first two elections in 1856 and 1858 were contested under the franchise arrangements that had applied for the old Legislative Council. The right of electoral enrolment was granted to any person holding freehold property to the value of ¬£100, leasehold property to the annual value of ¬£10, possessing a pastoral licence, having a salary of ¬£100 per year, paying board or lodgings to the value of ¬£40 per year, or just lodging to ¬£10 per year. Potential electors had to have met these requirements for six months prior to their name being placed on the electoral roll. Rolls were compiled once a year by an officer appointed by the local Magistrate's Court. Special hearings were held after each compilation at which objections to a name appearing or being rejected from the roll could be lodged. The 1856 Census allows analysis of the proportion of the population entitled to vote, and published roll data also specifies the qualification under which electors were granted their right to appear on the roll. { border=\\"1\\" + 1856 Census Population Analysis ! !!

However, the six months residency requirement remained, which disenfranchised many people in itinerant occupations. The property qualifications remained for non-resident voters, allowing plural voting for those who held property in several seats. The property vote probably explains the high rate of enrolment in Sydney districts at the table of 1856 data. As late as 1891, more than one in ten names on the roll in inner Sydney districts qualified on the basis of the property vote. The 1858 Act also introduced two special categories of electorates. Three Gold Fields electorates were defined as covering declared gold fields within specified general electorates. Rolls were not kept for Gold Fields seats, voters being able to establish their right to vote by presenting either a mining licence or business licence in a proclaimed gold field that had been held for at least six months. Voters could also appear on the roll for general districts, but were prevented from voting in both their resident general district and the overlaying Gold Fields district. The second special seat was the University of Sydney, which would become entitled to a seat once there were 100 graduates resident in the colony. The University Senate petitioned for the seat to be created in 1876. The first election was a by-election on 8 September 1876, William Charles Windeyer defeating the youthful Edmund Barton 49 votes to 43. Registrar Hugh Kennedy advised: As it appears that there is no legal necessity for members of the University who take part in the Election of a Representative to appear in academic costume, they will not be required to do so; but they are requested, if they conveniently can, to comply with the customary practice on such occasions. Oddly, the next day the notice had been amended to say academic costume was \\"required\\". The 1880 Electoral Act redrew the State's electoral boundaries to account for the changing distribution of population. The enrolment provisions of the 1858 Act were retained, though the Gold Fields and University of Sydney districts were abolished.. The most significant change to enrolment procedures took place with the 1893 Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act. For the first time residence was made the sole basis for establishing a right to vote. Plural voting was abolished by ending the property vote, electors being only entitled to enrol in the district in which they resided. The required period of residence was also reduced to three months. The existing rolls were abandoned under the new Act. Entirely new rolls were prepared for the 1894 election, which probably explains the significant spike in turnout to 80% at the 1894 election, the highest rate until the introduction of compulsory voting. The period of residence was further reduced to one month in 1896, voters also being allowed to vote in their old districts in the interim. Certain classes of voters such as police and the military were denied the right to vote, though these restrictions were removed in the following decade. Following the lead of other states, women were granted the vote for the 1904 election, though women were not allowed to run for Parliament until 1920. Aborigines were not denied the right to vote, but always struggled to meet the residency requirements. The adoption of the joint roll arrangements with the Commonwealth in the 1920s effectively removed the right of Aborigines to vote until the 1960s. The 1893 Act had adopted a Voter's Right document that a voter presented to be checked off the roll before a ballot paper was issued. In 1900, the compilation of annual rolls was made a function of the local police and Elector's Rights were abolished in 1906. Rolling rolls rather than annual reviews were adopted in 1920. Compulsory enrolment was adopted in 1920 and compulsory voting for the 1930 election. The only significant change to enrolment laws since has been the extension of the vote to 18-year-olds in 1973. In both World Wars, special provisions were introduced to allow service personal to retain their electoral rights. The vote was also extended to service personal under the legal voting age.  Atlas Introduction - The Changing Electoral System  The first election was conducted under first past the post voting in districts returning between one and four Members. Voters had as many votes as there were vacancies to be filled. Like minded candidates in multi-Member districts would arrange a \\"bunch\\", advocating a vote for a ticket of candidates. This voting method was retained for both the 1858 and 1880 Electoral Acts. However, the 1880 Act included a provision to deal with future population growth by allowing districts to be allocated extra Members as population increased, up to a maximum of four Members. The size of the Parliament increased from 108 MLAs in 1880 to 141 in 1891, with an increase in multi- Member districts. The Act failed to provide for the loss of seats in districts with declining population. Along with other inadequacies in the electoral system, this led to the reforms of 1893. The 1893 Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act divided the state into 125 single Member electoral districts, with Members elected by simple majority or first past the post voting. Following Federation, the size of the Parliament was reduced to 90 seats in 1904. The form of the ballot paper was changed in 1906 and the confusing method of crossing out the names of candidates not supported was replaced by the Commonwealth procedure of marking the boxes for preferred candidates. With three Parties in the field in the 1890s, informal electoral pacts were adopted to cope with first past the post voting. In the period where Labor supported Reid's Free Trade Government, the two Parties avoided contesting seats held by the other. The demise of the Progressives after 1904 reduced politics to a two-party system, though many former Progressive MLAs remained in the Assembly as independent liberals. Other organisations such as the Temperance Alliance and the Farmers' and Settlers' Association chose to issue lists of preferred candidates in this period. The problem of competing conservative candidates dividing the non-Labor vote was dealt with by several experiments with the electoral system between 1910 and 1930. The first was the introduction of second ballots at the 1910 election. If the first ballot failed to produce a candidate with more than 50% of the vote, a second ballot was conducted one to three weeks later between the two leading candidates. This overcame the problem of competing anti-Labor candidates, but in practice revealed other problems. There were 26 second ballots between 1910 and 1920, and in 20 cases, the turnout increased at the second ballot. At the 1913 election, the increased turnout at the second ballot appeared largely responsible for Labor winning seats where Labor's vote had trailed the combined vote of non-Labor candidates on the first ballot. In this period, there were several attempts to establish a new Progressive Party. The split in the Labor Party over conscription resulted in the Liberal Party, Progressive and pro-conscription Labor MLAs coalescing into a new Nationalist Party. In the post-war period, the pressure for a separate Progressive Party was revived. The new party was in favour of proportional representation, the system introduced and used at the three elections in 1920, 1922 and 1925. Ballots were now to be marked with numbered preferences rather than ticks and crosses, mimicking the new Federal preferential system. The counting method adopted was similar to the Tasmanian Hare-Clark system, or the modern Senate system. The main difference was that candidates were listed in alphabetic order, not grouped by party. At the first election in 1920, preferences were compulsory, producing an informal vote of 9.7%. It was as high as 16% in Botany where voters were required to indicate 19 preferences. Preferences were made voluntary beyond the number of Members to be elected ahead of the 1922 election, reducing the informal vote to 3.6% in 1922 and 3.3% in 1925. Proportional representation proved unpopular with many Members. The parties were also unhappy with the finely divided Parliaments the system produced. Declining population in the west of the State required the boundaries to be re-drawn and the opportunity was taken to revert to single-Member districts for the 1927 election. By this stage the parties had stabilised into the system that remains today, a single Labor Party opposed by two Parties, one rural based and the second predominantly urban based. The 1927 election was fought on single Member districts, but using optional preferential voting, a provision imposed on the Lang Government by the Legislative Council. The Bavin Coalition Government that followed introduced compulsory preferential voting for the 1930 election. This system remained in place until changes to the Constitution in 1980 re-introduced optional preferential voting. Both single-Member districts and optional preferential voting are now entrenched in the State's Constitution and a referendum is required to change them.

The battle resulted in the Free French Forces taking the colony of Gabon and its capital, Libreville, from Vichy French forces. It was the only significant engagement in Central Africa during the war. Background In June 1940, Germany invaded and defeated France, and subsequently occupied a portion of the country. Philippe P√©tain established a collaborationist government in Vichy to administer unoccupied French territory. On 18 June French General Charles De Gaulle broadcast an appeal over the radio to his compatriots abroad, calling on them to reject the Vichy regime and join the United Kingdom in its war against Germany and Italy. The broadcast provoked division in France's African territories, where colonists were forced to choose sides. On 26 August, the governor and military commanders in the colony of French Chad announced that they were rallying to De Gaulle's Free French Forces. A small group of Gaullists seized control of French Cameroon the following morning, and on 28 August a Free French official ousted the pro-Vichy governor of French Congo. The next day the governor of Ubangi-Shari declared that his territory would support De Gaulle. His declaration prompted a brief struggle for power with a pro-Vichy army officer, but by the end of the day all of the colonies that formed French Equatorial Africa had rallied to Free France, except for French Gabon. On the evening of 28‚Äì29 August 1940, Governor Georges Masson had pledged Gabon's allegiance to Free France. He met immediate opposition from much of Libreville's French population and from Gabon's influential, conservative Catholic bishop, Louis Tardy, who favoured Vichy France's anti-Freemason policies. Facing pressure, Masson was forced to rescind his pledge. Free French sympathizers were subsequently arrested by the colonial administration and either imprisoned on board the auxiliary cruiser or deported to Dakar, Senegal. De Gaulle was perturbed by Gabon's refusal to join his cause and described his dilemma in his memoirs: \\"a hostile enclave, that was hard to reduce because it gave on to the ocean, was created in the heart of our equatorial holdings.\\" General Edgard de Larminat stated that the failure to secure the territory would threaten \\"the very principle of our presence in Africa.\\" Prelude Following the rallying of Cameroon on 27 August, the Gabonese authorities decided to reinforce their frontier with that province along with the Ntem river. On 3 September, Roger Gardet entered Bitam by a ruse. On the pretext of medical necessity, he received permission from Captain Gourv√®s at Bitam to cross the frontier. Gourv√®s agreed to rally his troops to Free France only if his superior, the chief administrator of Woleu- Ntem based at Oyem, a certain Besson, did the same. Besson at first refused, but on 5 September Gardet informed him that he was relieving him of his command. Besson left for Cameroon and the following day, 6 September, Free French forces arrived in Bitam and Oyem with Pierre Roger Martocq as the new administrator of Woleu-Ntem. On 11 September, Masson held a meeting with his army and navy commanders at which it was decided to reinforce Mayumba. On 9 and 15 September, Colonel Andr√© Parant brought a dozen Free French fighters into Mayumba on a Potez 540. On 15 September, the Vichy reinforcements arrived on the Cap des Palmes, escorted by the submarine : a troop of marines from the and the defence of Port-Gentil. While the commander of the submarine, Captain Bertrand de Saussine du Pont de Gault was breakfasting with the district administrator, the Free French invaded the administrator's residence. After several hours of discussions, and with Parant's men occupying the city, Saussine was permitted to leave, taking with him whoever did not wish to join the Free French. Most of the marines opted to stay in Mayumba. On 8 October, De Gaulle arrived in Douala, Cameroon. Four days later he authorised plans for the invasion of French Equatorial Africa. He wanted to use French Equatorial Africa as a base to launch attacks into Axis-controlled Libya. For this reason, he personally headed northward to survey the situation in Chad, located on the southern border of Libya. Battle French Equatorial Africa On 27 October, Free French forces crossed into French Equatorial Africa and took the town of Mitzic. On 5 November, the Vichy garrison at Lambar√©n√© capitulated. Meanwhile, the main Free French forces under General Philippe Leclerc and Battalion Chief (major) Marie Pierre Koenig departed from Douala, French Cameroon. Their goal was to take Libreville, French Equatorial Africa. The British expressed doubt in De Gaulle's ability to establish control over the Vichy territory, but they eventually agreed to lend naval support to the Free French. On 8 November 1940, the sloop discovered the Vichy submarine Poncelet shadowing the Anglo-French task force and gave chase. The sloop was too slow to intercept the submarine, so Admiral Cunningham ordered his flagship, , to launch its Supermarine Walrus biplane. The aircraft straddled the submarine with two salvos of 100 lb depth charges as it attempted to dive, damaging it. It was then scuttled off Port-Gentil, with the captain resolving to sink with his vessel. Koenig's forces landed at Pointe La Mondah on the night of 8 November. His forces included French Legionnaires (including the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade), Senegalese and Cameroonian troops. On 9 November, Free French Westland Lysander aircraft operating out of Douala bombed Libreville aerodrome.Stapleton, Timothy J. A military History of Africa p. 225 The aerodrome was eventually captured, despite stiff resistance met by Koenig's force in its approach.

Libreville was captured on 10 November. On 12 November, the final Vichy forces at Port Gentil surrendered without a fight. Governor Masson ‚Äì despairing of his actions ‚Äì committed suicide. Aftermath The Free French lost four aircraft and six aircrew in the campaign.G. H. Bennett, The RAF's French Foreign Legion: De Gaulle, the British and the Re-emergence of French Airpower, 1940‚Äì45 (London and New York: Continuum, 2011), p. 30. There is disagreement about the total number of human losses. De Gaulle said \\"some twenty\\" died in the campaign. Jean-Christophe Notin claimed 33 were killed. Eliane Ebako wrote that \\"dozens\\" lost their lives, while Jean-Pierre Az√©ma said \\"roughly one hundred\\" were killed. On 15 November, de Gaulle made a personal appeal that failed to persuade most of the captured Vichy soldiers‚Äîincluding General ‚Äîto join the Free French. As a result, they were interned as prisoners of war in Brazzaville, French Congo for the duration of the war. With their control consolidated in Equatorial Africa, the Free French began focusing on the campaign in Italian Libya. De Gaulle relieved General Leclerc of his post in Cameroon and sent him to Fort Lamy, Chad to oversee offensive preparations. The conflict in Gabon triggered a mass migration of Gabonese to Spanish Guinea. French Equatorial Africa cut its ties with the Vichy-controlled West African territories, and rebuilt its economy around trade with nearby British possessions, namely Nigeria. Tensions between Vichy and Free French factions remained long after the invasion. The seizure of Gabon and the rest of French Equatorial Africa gave Free France new-found legitimacy; no longer was it an organization of exiles in Britain, as it now had its own sizable territory to govern.

Remote sensing  Earth thermophysics is a branch of geophysics that uses the naturally occurring surface temperature as a function of the cyclical variation in solar radiation to characterise planetary material properties. Thermophysical properties are characteristics that control the diurnal, seasonal, or climatic surface and subsurface temperature variations (or thermal curves) of a material. The most important thermophysical property is thermal inertia, which controls the amplitude of the thermal curve and albedo (or reflectivity), which controls the average temperature. This field of observations and computer modeling was first applied to Mars due to the ideal atmospheric pressure for characterising granular materials based upon temperature. The Mariner 6, Mariner 7, and Mariner 9 spacecraft carried thermal infrared radiometers, and a global map of thermal inertia was produced from modeled surface temperatures collected by the Infrared Thermal Mapper Instruments (IRTM) on board the Viking 1 and 2 Orbiters. The original thermophysical models were based upon the studies of lunar temperature variations. Further development of the models for Mars included surface- atmosphere energy transfer, atmospheric back-radiation, surface emissivity variations, CO2 frost and blocky surfaces, variability of atmospheric back- radiation, effects of a radiative-convective atmosphere, and single-point temperature observations.

Light curtains can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding. By reducing the need for physical guards and barriers, light curtains can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding. The operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of light curtains by, for example, allowing easier access for semi-automatic procedures. Description Light curtains fall into a category of equipment known as presence detection devices. Other common presence detection devices are pressure-sensitive safety mats and laser scanners (often used on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) when in industrial settings). Most important applications of safety relays are in automation industries dealing with robotic cell setup. Light curtains are supplied as a pair with a transmitter and receiver. The transmitter projects an array of parallel infrared light beams to the receiver which consists of a number of photoelectric cells. When an object breaks one or more of the beams a stop signal is sent to the guarded equipment. The light beams emitted from the transmitter are sequenced, one after the other, and pulsed at a specific frequency. The receiver is designed to only accept the specific pulse and frequency from its dedicated transmitter. This enables the rejection of spurious infrared light and thus enhances their suitability as components within a safety system. Typically, light curtains are connected to a safety relay which will remove motive power from the hazard in the event that an object is detected. Safety relays can be provided with muting functionality which enables the temporary disabling of the safety function to allow objects to pass through the light curtains without tripping the safety relay. This is particularly useful for machinery which has some semi-automatic procedures. Standards The following partial list of standards should be used for guidance when implementing light curtains: *ANSI B11.19 *IEC61496-1/-2 *IEC/TS 62046; *ISO13855 (EN 999); Occupational safety and health Safety equipment de:Lichtvorhang ","title":"Light curtain"},{"id":"9766583","text":"Yangwei () was a cruiser built for the Imperial Chinese Navy. She was built by Charles Mitchell & Company in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England, from a design by Sir George Wightwick Rendel which had already been used on the Chilean Navy vessel (later the Imperial Japanese Navy's ). Two ships were ordered by the Chinese, the Yangwei and the . Both would serve together throughout their careers, assigned to the Beiyang Fleet and based in Taku during the summer, and Chemulpo, Korea, in the winter. Yangwei did not see any action during the Sino-French War, but in the First Sino-Japanese War, she was in the Chinese line at the Battle of Yalu River on 17 September 1894. She was set alight by combined fire from the Japanese fleet, and drifted south out of the battle until running aground on a reef. She was subsequently destroyed by a spar torpedo from a boat of the Japanese cruiser . Design The design for Yangwei was advertised by its designer, British naval architect Sir George Wightwick Rendel, as an example of a low-cost cruiser able to withstand larger ironclad warships. The design was later seen as an intermediate concept between his flat-iron gunboats and the protected cruiser. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, less maneuverable ships. Yangweis basic design was initially used on the Chilean Navy vessel , which preceded it in construction, although several changes were made, including increasing the number of steam boilers from four to six. Both Yangwei and her sister ship, the shared the same design, and were built by British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell on the River Tyne near Newcastle Upon Tyne. Mitchell had worked alongside Rendel, and was building Arturo Prat. Yangwei measured long overall, with a beam of and an average draft of . The ships were manned by 140 crew. The most significant difference between the two ships was the power output of their reciprocating engines; while Yangwei had an output of , Chaoyong engine supplied . This meant that while Yangwei could achieve a speed of , the Chaoyong could go faster at . They both were constructed out of steel with waterproof bulkhead below the waterline, a single smokestack, and twin masts, which could also be used for sails. The prow was reinforced for ramming. They had a number of technical innovations, including hydraulic steering systems and electrical incandescent light fixtures. The main armaments were breech- loading Armstrong Whitworth cannons, one on the bow and one on the stern, mounted in stationary gun shields. These shields were added for weather proofing reasons, but restricted the angle of fire that could be taken, as well as the elevation they could fire at. Yangwei also had four inch guns, (two to each side), two long guns, four Gatling guns, four Hotchkiss guns, two 4-barrelled Nordenfeldt guns, as well as two torpedo tubes. Both ships were equipped with two pinnaces, which were each armed with spar torpedoes. Career Chinese diplomat Li Hongzhang was made aware of Rendel's designs, and following the start of the construction on Arturo Prat, an order was placed on behalf of the Imperial Chinese Navy for two ships of the same type. Yangwei was laid down on 15 January 1880, and launched on 29 January 1881. Yangwei was subsequently worked up, and was announced as completed on 14 July that year. They were completed ahead of Arturo Prat, who instead would enter service as the Imperial Japanese Navy's after Chile cancelled the order following the end of the War of the Pacific. The main deck of the Yangwei Each of the Chinese vessels were equipped with Chinese crews, with Western captains and instructors in place. They sailed out of the Tyne River on 9 August, and stopped in Plymouth Sound two days later where Admiral Ding Ruchang joined them to take command of the ships for the journey to China. Following their arrival on 20 October in Hong Kong, they toured Canton (now Guangzhou) and Shanghai, before travelling to the Taku Forts. Chaoyong was boarded by Hongzhang, and the two cruisers took the diplomat to inspect the dredging of the port at Taku (now the Port of Tianjin). Both ships were assigned to the Beiyang Fleet in the north, and Ruchang was placed in command. On 23 June 1884, Yangwei was present alongside Chaoyong, as well as the corvette and the sloop , when the Chinese vessels met their French Navy counterparts. The French ships dwarfed their Chinese counterparts, and following a discussion between the leaders of each fleet, the French put on a firing demonstration. Afterwards, the Chinese fleet broke up with Yang-Wu headed to Foochow (now Fuzhou), and the two cruisers sailed back to Taku. The Sino-French War broke out shortly afterwards, although Yangwei saw no action, there was speculation that the two cruisers might be sent to break the French blockade of Formosa. She and Chaoyong were sent south to Shanghai in November, but were then brought back north after concerns were raised about growing Japanese influences in Korea. =Battle of Yalu River= Following the war, Chaoyong and Yangwei continued to operate together. They operated out of Taku, but since the water froze over during winter, they would spend that part of the year in the Korean port of Chemulpo (now Incheon). During the First Sino- Japanese War in 1894, Yangwei remained with the fleet and was supporting troop transports when they made contact with a Japanese fleet on the morning of 17 September. One of the Armstrong Whitworth cannons on the Yangwei As the Japanese fleet moved in, the Chinese fleet moved away from anchor and attempted for form up in a line. However, the manoeuvre was botched and Yangwei was one of four ships which ended up behind the others. This was due to a lack of maintenance over the years; with their equipment out of date they could barely make . Orders had been given for the ships to operate in pairs, with Yangwei and Chaoyong teamed together. This battle plan was alien to the premise of their design, inherent in the lack of armour for ships about to fight in the line of battle. At a distance of , the Japanese fleet targeted the Chaoyong and Yangwei. Within a few minutes, fires broke out on both ships, which quickly engulfed the central superstructures with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei fought no more, and eventually beached on a reef several miles south with the loss of the majority of her crew. The morning following the battle, she was destroyed by a spar torpedo from a boat of the Japanese cruiser . The Japanese fleet had kept their distance, only sending in their smaller boats to investigate, fearing a counterattack by the Chinese using torpedoes.

He was the sixth son of Emperor Gaozong, and the second son of his second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian). He was known for writing commentaries for the Book of Later Han, the official history of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He became crown prince in 675 after his older brother Li Hong's death (which traditional historians believed to be a poisoning by Empress Wu), but soon fell out of favor with Empress Wu herself. In 680, Empress Wu had her associates accuse Li Xian of treason, and he was demoted to commoner rank and exiled. In 684, after Emperor Gaozong's death, Empress Wu, then empress dowager, had her associate Qiu Shenji (‰∏òÁ•ûÂã£) visit Li Xian to force him to commit suicide. In 706, his younger brother Emperor Zhongzong provided Li Xian with an honorable burial by interring his remains at the Qianling Mausoleum.  Background  \\"Polo players at their game\\", detail on the west wall of a tomb pathway of Prince Zhanghuai's tomb, interred in 706 AD during the Tang dynasty. The tomb is part of the larger Qianling Mausoleum near modern-day Xi'an (formerly Chang'an, the Tang capital). Li Xian was born on 29 January 655, as the sixth son of Emperor Gaozong and the second son of his then-favorite concubine Consort Wu (later known as Wu Zetian). There were, however, persistent rumors inside the palace that he was not actually born of Consort Wu but of her older sister Wu Shun (who was later created the Lady of Han). In 655, the same year that his mother Consort Wu displaced Emperor Gaozong's first wife Empress Wang as empress, Li Xian was created the Prince of Lu. In 656, he was initially titularly given the post of prefect of Qi Prefecture (Â≤êÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and then the dual posts as prefect of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (ÈõçÂ∑û, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi) and commandant at You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, roughly modern Beijing). It was said that his behavior was elegant, even in his youth, and, according to a comment that Emperor Gaozong made to the chancellor Li Ji, he had studied the Classic of History, Classic of Rites, Analects, and a number of ancient poems and could remember them clearly. In 661, his title was changed to Prince of Pei, and he was given the titles of commandant at Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and major general, but he continued to also serve as prefect of Yong Prefecture. At this time, he had the literarily talented official Wang Bo on staff. Around this time, the princes were apparently often engaged in cockfighting. Wang Bo wrote a playful piece entitled the Declaration Against the Prince of Zhou's Cock (Ê™ÑÂë®ÁéãÈõûÊñá) (the Prince of Zhou was Li Xian's brother Li Xi«én (note different tone), later named Li Zhe), which, however, when Emperor Gaozong read it, caused Emperor Gaozong to be angry, as he believed this would cause discord between his sons, and therefore expelled Wang from the Pei mansion. In 672, Li Xian's title was changed to Prince of Yong, and he was given the titles of commandant at Liang Prefecture (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu), but continued to also serve as general and prefect of Yong Prefecture. His name was also changed to Li De. In 674, his name was changed back to Li Xian.  As crown prince  From Paludan's source: \\"In this mural foreign ambassadors are being received at court. The two elegantly clad figures on the right are from Korea, the bare- headed, large-nosed figure in the center is an envoy from the west. Mural from Li Xian's tomb, Qianling Mausoleum, Shaanxi, 706.\\" Gaozong's 6th son, Li Xian, Qianling, Shaanxi, 706.\\" In 675, Li Xian's older brother Li Hong the crown prince died‚Äîa death that traditional historians generally believed to be a poisoning ordered by Empress Wu. On July 3,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Li Xian was created crown prince to replace Li Hong. Emperor Gaozong soon ordered that much of government matters be ruled on by Li Xian, But because most of the imperial work was done by Empress Wu, his decisions were under her mother's control. But Li Xian was praised for making good decisions. Also around this time, Li Xian led a group of scholars, including Zhang Da'an, Liu Nayan (ÂäâË®•Ë®Ä), Ge Xiyuan (Ê†ºÂ∏åÂÖÉ), Xu Shuya (Ë®±ÂèîÁâô), Cheng Xuanyi (ÊàêÁéÑ‰∏Ä), Shi Cangzhu (Âè≤ËóèË´∏), and Zhou Baoning (Âë®ÂØ∂ÂØß), in writing commentaries for the Book of Later Han, the official history of the Eastern Han Dynasty, written by the Liu Song scholar Fan Ye. Meanwhile, Li Xian's relationship with Empress Wu began to deteriorate, as Li Xian had heard the rumors that he was actually the son of Lady of Han, and had become fearful. Empress Wu, detecting this, had her literary staff write two works entitled, Good Examples for Shaoyang (Â∞ëÈôΩÊ≠£ÁØÑ, \\"Shaoyang\\" being an oblique term for a crown prince) and Biographies of Filial Sons (Â≠ùÂ≠êÂÇ≥) and gave them to Li Xian, and further wrote a number of letters rebuking Li Xian, making him more fearful. At the same time, Empress Wu relinquished his duties as head of many government decisions and changed all Li Xian previous policies. Further, when the sorcerer Ming Chongyan (ÊòéÂ¥áÂÑº), who was well-trusted by Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu, was assassinated in 679, Empress Wu suspected Li Xian‚Äîas Ming had been known to repeatedly make comments to Empress Wu that included, \\"The Crown Prince cannot bear the responsibilities of state. The Prince of Ying [(i.e., Li Xian's younger brother Li Zhe, later Emperor Zhongzong] has an appearance most similar to Emperor Taizong ([Emperor Gaozong's father]),\\" and \\"The Prince of Xiang [(i.e., Li Xian's younger brother Li Dan, later Emperor Ruizong)] has the most honorable appearance.\\" Meanwhile, Li Xian was also known for his liking of music and women. (Some historians, pointing to oblique references that he was \\"particularly close\\" to a number of male servants, also believe that he liked sexual relations with both women and men.) When Empress Wu heard this, she had people report this to Emperor Gaozong, who ordered an investigation led by the officials Xue Yuanchao, Pei Yan, and Gao Zhizhou. When they searched the crown prince's stables, they found several hundred suits of black armor, and they believed this to be evidence of a coup, and after interrogation, one of Li Xian's favorite servants, Zhao Daosheng (Ë∂ôÈÅìÁîü), admitted to assassinating Ming on Li Xian's orders. Emperor Gaozong, who had favored Li Xian, considered pardoning him, but Empress Wu refused. On September 20, 680,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Gaozong deposed Li Xian and reduced him to commoner rank, delivering him from the eastern capital Luoyang (where Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu had long taken up residence) to the capital Chang'an to be imprisoned there. His close associates were executed, and the seized armor was burned publicly to demonstrate Li Xian's treason. Li Zhe was created crown prince to replace him.  After removal  In 683, Li Xian was moved from Chang'an to Ba Prefecture (Â∑¥Â∑û, roughly modern Bazhong, Sichuan). In 684, after Emperor Gaozong's death, Li Zhe initially took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), but soon was deposed himself due to signs of disobedience to Empress Wu (now empress dowager), and Li Dan became emperor instead (as Emperor Ruizong), although Empress Dowager Wu retained all powers as regent. In spring 684, she sent the general Qiu Shenji to Ba Prefecture with the order of, \\"Examine the house of Li Xian the former crown prince to prevent external attacks.\\" However, she hinted to him that he should have Li Xian killed. When he got to Ba Prefecture, he placed Li Xian into a small room and forced him to commit suicide. When news of Li Xian's death arrived at Luoyang, Empress Wu publicly blamed Qiu and demoted him to the post of prefect of Die Prefecture (ÁñäÂ∑û, roughly modern Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu), while publicly mourning Li Xian and posthumously creating him the title of Prince of Yong. (Qiu was soon recalled to Luoyang to again be general.) After Empress Wu's death in 705 and the restoration of Emperor Zhongzong to the throne, Emperor Zhongzong had Li Xian's casket returned to Chang'an, to be buried near the tomb of Emperor Gaozong. After Emperor Ruizong became emperor again in 710, he had Li Xian's crown prince title restored.

At one time, he had unfettered access to between 2,000 and 3,000 computers that had been used to visit websites of interest to pedophiles as the result of his use of a Trojan horse. Willman's actions helped put California Superior Court judge Ronald Kline in prison for more than two years in 2007 for possession of child pornography. However, the legality of Willman's use of the Trojan horse was a basis for appeal by the judge. Biography =Early life= Willman was born in 1980 in Langley, British Columbia, Canada.Parsons, Dana.

(May 12, 2003) The lawyer for a California judge accused of possessing child porn after a reclusive Lower Mainland teen hacked. At some time before 2000, Willman devised a Trojan horse, a type of computer program, that he used to conduct his investigations.Debra Wong Yang (8 March 2004) United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Government's Ninth Circuit Opening Brief: US v. Kline. (Brief filed by US Government in United States v. Kline, 112 Fed. Appx. 562 (C.A.9 (Cal.), 4 October 2004) The Trojan horse was posted to websites of interest to pedophiles in a way that it appeared to be a picture-file attached to a message, but was actually a program file. When a visitor to the pedophile website downloaded the file, the visitor unwittingly downloaded the Trojan horse, and would typically be unaware that it was running on his or her computer. Willman had no control over who chose to download the Trojan horse. Once it had been downloaded, Willman could access, search, and retrieve files from the infected computer. Willman stated \\"My whole intent, after the program started working as I expected it to, was to help kids.\\" Willman estimated that his Trojan Horse gave him access to between 2,000 and 3,000 computers that had been used to visit websites of interest to pedophiles, including those of police officers, military personnel, social workers, priests, and judges.Meyer, Paul S., et al.

(April 1, 2003) Los Angeles Times Hacker in Porn Case of Ex-Judge Recants Testimony on Ties to Police. Section: California Metro; Page 6. Some time after August 2000, Willman anonymously provided to a private watchdog group documents related to a Kentucky state investigation of child molestation and production of child pornography. Prior to January 2001, the United States Customs Service contacted Willman to see whether he had discovered any useful information related to a suspected Russian child pornography ring. United States v. Kline In early May 2000, California Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline (1941‚Äì) downloaded the Trojan horse to his computer.Haldane, David. (October 28, 2003) Los Angeles Times Evidence on Ex-Judge Is Tossed. Section: California Metro; Page 5. The Trojan Horse allowed Willman, who was in British Columbia, to monitor the contents of Kline's computer in California. Between May 2000 and mid-April 2001, Willman copied from Kline's computer portions of Kline's diary. In April 2001, Willman anonymously forwarded excerpts of a diary on Kline's hard drives with a final entry dated March 18, 2001 to the website of pedophile-watchdog PedoWatch. PedoWatch passed the diary on to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office, which forwarded it to the California Attorney General's office, which in turn sent it on to the City of Irvine Police Department. =The search= In November 2001, Irvine police searched Kline's Irvine home and found more than 1,500 pornographic computer images of young children on the judge's home computer. Child porn also was found on Kline's courthouse computer.Hanley, Christine. (June 18, 2003) Los Angeles Times Key Evidence Is Tossed Out in Ex-Judge's Child Porn Case. Section: California Metro; Page 5. This event drew national attention and ultimately led Kline to drop his bid for reelection as judge, largely as a result of efforts by talk radio hosts John and Ken of KFI-AM (640).Hanley, Christine.

After Kline was charged in November 2001 by the United States Federal Government with possession of child pornography, a man who said the judge had molested him when he was a 14 years old a quarter-century earlier came forward and California state child molestation charges were filed against Kline as well.Anton, Mike.

(May 24, 2004) United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Government's Ninth Circuit Reply Brief: US v. Kline. (May 24, 2004 reply to Defendant's April 22, 2004 brief filed by US Government in United States v. Klien, 112 Fed. Appx. 562 (C.A.9 (Cal.), Oct. 4, 2004) The state child molestation charges were dismissed in July 2003 after the legal case Stogner v. California, held that a California extension of the statute of limitations for sex-related child abuse could not be applied to previously time-barred prosecutions. =Legal proceedings= In the United States, evidence that derives from an illegal government search generally cannot be used in court against a defendant by the government.United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (October 4, 2004) United States v. Kline, 112 Fed. Appx. 562, (C.A.9 (Cal.), Oct. 4, 2004) (Opinion issued by Ninth Circuit in United States v. Kline, 112 Fed. Appx. 562 (C.A.9 (Cal.), Oct. 4, 2004)). However, evidence that derives from an illegal private search such as from a citizen tipster may be used in court by the government, even though the search was illegal. When an individual does the illegal search, a court answers the private/government search question by determining whether the individual was an \\"instrument or agent\\" of the government. If \\"the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct, and ... the party performing the search intended to assist law enforcement efforts,\\" then the party performing the illegal search is considered an agent of the government. On March 17, 2003, a federal judge ruled that Willman was working as a government informant when he invaded Judge Kline's computers because (i) Willman thought of himself as an agent for law enforcement and (ii) Willman's motivation for the invasion was to act for law enforcement purposes. Since the judge ruled that this violated Kline's United States 4th Amendment right to privacy against illegal searches by the government, the judge suppressed some of the prosecution's strongest evidence against Kline.Long Beach Press-Telegram (October 28, 2003) Evidence vs. ex- judge tossed in child porn case. Section:News; Page A15. Specifically, the judge suppressed all evidence seized from Kline's home and his home computer, including excerpts from a computer diary about his sexual desires and more than 1,500 pornographic photos of young boys. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the appeals court disagreed with the federal judge and found that it was not enough for Willman to act with the intent to assist the government. There needed to have been some degree of governmental knowledge and acquiescence in Willman's actions to find that Willman was acting as a government agent. Thus, the appeals court reversed the district court's order suppressing the evidence that was found as the fruit of Willman's illegal, but private, search. In March 2005, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case, which ended Kline's appeals.Associated Press (March 29, 2005) Supreme Court declines to hear appeal in child porn case against former Calif. judge. =The admission= With the 9th Circuit and United States Supreme Court actions, Willman's evidence was now back in play.Charleston Gazette & Daily Mail.

Career Clempson began his career in the late 1960s with the power trio, Bakerloo (originally The Bakerloo Blues Line), playing blues-rock. In 1969, he joined Colosseum, until they disbanded in 1971. After Colosseum's split he went on to join Humble Pie in 1971, replacing Peter Frampton. When the band split in 1975 he and Greg Ridley joined drummer Cozy Powell to form Strange Brew. During this period, Clempson auditioned for Deep Purple but lost to Tommy Bolin. Although he played in Marriott's All Stars, he opted not to join the reformed Humble Pie in 1980 in favor of joining Jack Bruce & Friends instead. In 1977, Clempson formed the short lived band Rough Diamond with former Uriah Heep singer David Byron. In 1994, Clempson re-joined Colosseum reunion version of the band, and he continued performing with the band until their farewell concert at SBE in London on 28 February 2015. Clempson has appeared as a guest musician with Jack Bruce, Billy Cobham and Dave Sancious, Roger Waters, Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Bob Dylan, Chris de Burgh, Kiri te Kanawa and Karl Jenkins (on Kiri Sings Karl, 2006) and Jon Anderson. Credits extend into scores for many films, most notably Evita, G.I. Jane, Lawn Dogs, and Tomorrow Never Dies. Clempson was also called upon by the Oscar-winning composer Trevor Jones for arrangements for the 1999 romantic comedy film, Notting Hill. From 2008 to summer 2012, he played as a member of Hamburg Blues Band. After HBB he formed his own band, The Clem Clempson Band, which started touring at the end of February 2013 in Braunschweig, Germany. Among others the band includes Adrian Askew from Hamburg Blues Band and the band also features Chris Farlowe on vocals occasionally. In 2017, Clempson became a member of a new trio band called JCM. Other members of the band were drummer Jon Hiseman and bass player Mark Clarke. The band recorded an album Heroes in late 2017 and it was released in April 2018. JCM began touring Europe on the 7th of April in 2018 but the tour ended after the show on 22 April, in Bonn, due to Jon Hiseman's illness. The rest of the tour dates were cancelled.

It was written by lead singer Steven Tyler and lead guitarist Joe Perry. The song title is an acronym for \\"Fucked Up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional\\", as stated in the album's liner notes. The song, totaling four minutes, nine seconds, is the second track on the band's 1989 album Pump. It was released as a promotional single to rock radio in 1989, and reached No. 14 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Song information \\"F.I.N.E.\\" is an upbeat, hard rock song, similar to \\"Young Lust\\" both lyrically and musically. Its raunchy lyrics focus on youth angst and lasciviousness, and the verses feature the line \\"I'm ready\\" after each line, suggesting sexual arousal, or being \\"ready\\" for sex. Tongue-in-cheek lyrics are prevalent, including \\"she's got the Cracker Jack, now all I want's the prize\\", \\"I got the right key baby, but the wrong keyhole\\", \\"I shove my tongue right between your cheeks\\", etc. The chorus repeats the word \\"Alright\\", followed by a person who thinks the narrator is alright, including \\"your daddy\\", \\"your mama\\", \\"my old lady\\", \\"my little sister\\", \\"my brother\\", \\"even Tipper\\" (a reference to Tipper Gore who headed the Parents Music Resource Center censorship campaign during this time), and \\"Joe Perry\\" (a reference to Aerosmith's lead guitarist). The only mentions of the term \\"F.I.N.E.\\" are in the line \\"my brand new baby looks so F-I-N-E fine\\" and in a bridge towards the end of the song, where Tyler sings, \\"Everything about you is so F-I-N-E fine\\". Later on the Pump album, in \\"What It Takes\\", is the line, \\"Girl, before I met you I was F-I-N-E fine\\". F.I.N.E. was one of the potential titles brainstormed for the album that became Pump, but was blocked by Geffen A&R; man John Kalodner. If one looks closely at the trucks on the front cover, the word FINE can be seen on their side. \\"F.I.N.E.\\" ‚Äì \\"Such a good fuckin' song!\\" said Tyler ‚Äì ends with a snippet of the singer doing a variation on a line from \\"Hangman Jury\\" from Permanent Vacation. Meaning of acronym In the album liner notes, F.I.N.E. is said to stand for \\"Fucked up, Insecure, Neurotic and Emotional.\\" This may have an association to the rehabilitation programs such as A.A. and N.A.. Many such programs use this phrase to describe the feeling of your life being out of control. The acronym is also discussed in the movies The Italian Job [Freaked Out, Insecure, Neurotic, Emotional] and Scream 2 and in the show Happy Valley (series 1 episode 4). As well as the movie ‚ÄúDeadpool 2‚Äù. Liv Tyler also references this as a nod to her father at the end of the movie Super starring Rainn Wilson. During her scene with the rehabilitation group session she is heard stating \\"fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.\\" In other media The song is featured in Walt Disney World's Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith in the coaster car with the license plate \\"BUHBYE\\" which also features \\"Young Lust\\" and a reworked version of \\"Love in an Elevator\\" that is re-titled as \\"Love in a Rollercoaster\\". F.I.N.E. was also the name of a hard rock band from Portland, ME. F.I.N.E. was also used as part of a quote in The Italian Job twice during the movie.

Acted in 1603 and first published in 1607, the play has generally been considered Heywood's masterpiece, and has received the most critical attention among Heywood's works.Logan, Terence P., and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Popular School: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1975; pp. 107‚Äì9. Along with the anonymous Arden of Faversham, Heywood's play has been regarded as the apex of Renaissance drama's achievement in the subgenre of bourgeois or domestic tragedy. The play was originally performed by Worcester's Men, the company for which Heywood acted and wrote in the early Jacobean era. The records of Philip Henslowe show that Heywood was paid ¬£6 for the play in February and March 1603. The 1607 quarto was printed by William Jaggard for the bookseller John Hodgets. A second quarto was issued in 1617 by William Jaggard's son Isaac Jaggard.Chambers, E. K. The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 341‚Äì2. The plot of Heywood's play derives from an Italian novel by Illicini, which was translated into English and published in The Palace of Pleasure by William Painter (1566).

Anne's family remarks how well suited she is for marriage and how well she is taking to it so far. Francis and Charles arrange to go hawking and hunting tomorrow. Wendoll and Cranwell place bets on the men. The next day, Francis and Charles argue over whose falcon did better, and the quarrel devolves into a fight. Charles kills two of Francis's men. Charles immediately repents his anger. His sister Susan encourages him to flee so that he won't be arrested. He resolves to stay and face the consequences of his actions, and the sheriff comes to arrest him. =Act II (Or Scenes IV-VII)-= Frankford ruminates on how lucky he is by birth and station, but mostly because he has such a lovely wife. Wendoll arrives with news of the fight between Charles and Francis. Frankford welcomes him and takes him in. The servant, Nick, does not like Wendoll, and swears he'll refuse to serve him. (Scene IV) Charles has been cleared of all charges, but it's cost him everything he has and now he's a \\"plain countryman\\". Shafton offers Charles 500 pounds in friendship....except it's not out of friendship; it's a ploy to get his remaining property, the house he shares with Susan.(Scene V) Wendoll is in love with Anne and is trying to ignore his feelings, not least because he loves Frankford so much. He confesses his love to her anyway, and though she is horrified at first, she begins to melt. He kisses her and encourages her to take him to bed, since her husband is away. Nick witnesses the end of their exchange and swears to kill Wendoll for abusing his mistress thus.(Scene VI) Charles and Susan are very poor, but thankful that they have a roof over their heads and each other. Shaft makes an offer on Charles's house, and when Charles refuses, has him arrested for not being able to pay back the money Shaft lent him. Francis takes joy in this, as he doesn't feel sufficiently revenged on Charles yet. He decides to seduce Susan to disgrace her and Charles with her lewdness, but when he sees her, he falls terribly in love with her.( Scene VII) =Act III (Or Scenes VIII-X)= Nick tells Frankford about Wendoll and Anne. At a card game after dinner where the conversation is full of doublespeak, Frankford begins to believe it and works out a plan to catch them in the act. He retires to bed early.(Scene VIII) Susan pleads for help from various friends and family members, who all cast her off. She despairs, and Francis sends her money. She rejoices, but when she learns it's from him, she refuses it. Despairing of ever being able to woo her, Francis decides to pay Charles's debts and drop the charges against him for killing the servants earlier, in hopes that this kindness will bring Susan around. Later, Susan and Charles are shocked to find out his debts have been paid by Sir Francis. Susan surmises this must be because of his love for her, and Charles seems to think that by giving Susan to Sir Francis, he can repay all.(Scene IX-X) =Act IV Or Scenes (XI-XIII)= Frankford and Nick devise a scheme to call him away from home and see what Wendoll and Anne do in his absence. As he departs, Wendoll convinces Anne to take their dinner in her private chambers, which will no doubt lead to dessert of a carnal nature. Frankford and Nick sneak home in the night and Frankford finds Anne and Wendoll in bed together. He chases Wendoll out and expresses his disappointment in Anne. He calls for their two children and scorns her in front of them. After a bit of time, he pronounces his sentence on her: she is to take all her furniture, all her clothes, all her everything, choose which servants she likes best, and remove herself to the manor house seven miles away, where she can live out her days in peace, but will never ever ever be allowed to communicate with Frankford or the children in any way ever again. (XI-XIII) =Act V (Or Scenes XIV-XVII)= Charles dresses up Susan and takes her to Sir Francis to be his bride and repay the debts. She resists, preferring death first, but relents at last. Francis is thrilled and makes preparations for their wedding at once.(XIV) Frankford makes sure Anne left nothing behind her and finds her lute, which makes him sad. Nick sets off with it to overtake her. Cranwell departs for Sir Francis, to let him know what's happened between Frankford and his sister. Anne is sad on the road to the manor house. Nick arrives with the lute, and she tells him to swear to Frankford that he saw her sad and that she will never again eat or drink. Wendoll encounters them and hopes to comfort Anne, but she calls him the devil and flies. Charles, Susan, and Francis go to visit Anne, who is on her deathbed. They tell her Frankford has agreed to see her. He arrives, and forgives her. She dies. Frankford laments, which restores the social and patriarchal order at the end of the play.(XV-XVII)  Self-starvation  Early Modern Elizabethan and Jacobean views of fasting or self-starvation were often hearkened to old Medieval views which considered a woman's fasting a visual cue to a woman's obedience, chastity, and honour. Eating, binging, or gluttony were considered to be fundamentally connected with sexuality. According to several Early Modern conduct book writers, the sin of gluttony will inevitably lead to lust, and several of these tract writers suggested female fasting should be a part of a woman's education as it would prove her to be a better wife and mother.

During the 2002 games the park hosted the bobsleigh, skeleton, luge, ski jumping, and Nordic combined events. It still serves a training center for Olympic and development level athletes. Other facilities in addition to the ski jumps and bobsled track located on site include a 2002 Winter Olympics and Ski Museum, day lodge, summer aerial training splash pool, ziplines, and a mountain coaster. Park history The park as seen from the base of a hill on a warm winter day Like the Utah Olympic Oval and Soldier Hollow, the park was designed and built specifically for the Olympic games, under the supervision of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC). The 1989 Olympic referendum, which was passed by Utahns, allowed for tax payer money to fund a winter sports park, which would be used if Salt Lake City won its bid for either the 1998 or 2002 Winter Olympics; Olympic funds and revenue would then be used to repay the state. In 1990 the Utah Sports Authority announced their plans to build the park, which included ski jumps and a bobsled-luge track, in Bear Hollow near Park City. Before construction on the park began, it faced criticism from local landowners and citizens of Summit County, concerned over traffic and environmental effects. Construction got underway following a groundbreaking ceremony on May 29, 1991. The original estimated cost of the park was $26.3 million and included the ski jumps, bobsled-luge track, and a day lodge, all to be completed by September 1992. The majority of the park was designed and engineered by Eckhoff, Watson and Preator Engineering and its joint venture partner, Van Boerum & Frank Associates, all of Salt Lake City. The park, with temporary spectator seating, during the 2002 Winter Olympics After Salt Lake City lost its bid to host the 1998 Winter Olympics in 1991, the Utah Sports Authority gained permission from the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to slowdown construction on the park, extending its planned opening date. Four of the park's ski jumps (18, 38, 65 and 90 meters) were completed and opened on December 12, 1992, and were formally dedicated in a ceremony on January 9, 1993. On July 31, 1993 the summer training facilities at the park, which included a ski jumping pool, were dedicated. The park's day lodge, located near the base of the jumps, was completed in late summer 1993. A groundbreaking ceremony on June 3, 1994 signaled the start of construction on the bobsled-luge track. The track was completed December 28, 1996 and its grand opening ceremony was held on January 25, 1997. The very first run on the new track was by luger Jon Owen on January 10, 1997. Following the completion of the track it was decided to reintroduce skeleton as an Olympic event during the 2002 Winter Olympics and plans called to use the track to host all three sliding events. Three of the park's ski jumps shown during the summer While construction was progressing on the track, Salt Lake City won its 1995 bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics, and plans were developed to expand the park. On October 9, 1997 SLOC okayed the plan to spend an additional $48 million to upgrade and expand the recently completed park. The plans called for replacing and moving the existing 90-meter ski jump, and building a brand new 120-meter jump. Also the construction of starting houses on the track, chairlifts, storage buildings, new access roads, pedestrian bridges, parking lots, and sewer and water lines were all part of the expansion plan. The transform of the park began during the Summer of 1998, with the majority of expansion work completed by fall 2000. Ownership of the park was transferred from the Utah Sports Authority to SLOC on July 14, 1999. Soon after, in Spring 2000, the name \\"Utah Winter Sports Park\\" became the \\"Utah Olympic Park'. =The park today= The park still serves a training center for Olympic and development level athletes, as well as a recreational highlight in the state. Other facilities in addition to the Nordic jumps and bobsled track located at the park include a 2002 Winter Olympics Museum and Ski Museum in the Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center, a day lodge, summer aerial training jumps and splash pool, ziplines, and a mountain coaster. Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center Located within the Utah Olympic Park is the Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center. The center stands next to the day lodge and summer splash pool. =History= For many years the Alf Engen Ski Foundation had desired to construct a museum to honor legendary skier Alf Engen, and display his winter sports collection. It was decided to do this inside a future building at the park, also named for a skier, Joe Quinney. A site dedication ceremony for the privately funded Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center was held August 28, 1999, while construction didn't begin until after the actual groundbreaking on March 28, 2000. Following the building's completion, it was temporarily turned over to SLOC during a ceremony on September 18, 2001. During the games the center would be used by Olympic officials, members of the world media and athletes, then after the games, the building would be turned back over to the foundation. The cost of just the vacant building was $10 million, the majority of which was privately funded, but SLOC did contribute a percentage of construction costs so the building could be used during the games. The completed building was in size with three stories, and its concrete exterior was covered with Plexiglas (various figures and designs were etched into the Plexiglas). The Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center inside the park Following the Olympics the building was turned into a ski and Olympic museum at a cost of $2.5 million more, for a total of $12.5 million. The Alf Engen Ski Museum opened in a soft opening on May 20, 2002, with exhibits designed by Academy Studios. The grand opening ceremony for the center was held July 5, 2002, and the building included the Engen Ski Museum, a gift shop, caf√© and a temporary Olympic photo exhibit (which would be replaced by a new Olympic museum in later years). On September 27, 2002, two life-sized statues of Alf Engen and Joe Quinney were unveiled in the Olympic plaza near the building. In May 2004 the Alf Engen Ski Foundation sold the center to the Utah Athletic Foundation, who owns and operates the surrounding Utah Olympic Park. In early June 2005 the temporary 2002 Olympic Photo Exhibit was replaced with a new permanent Olympic museum. An opening celebration for the officially titled \\"George Eccles Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Winter Games Museum\\" was held June 9, 2005. =Exhibits= The center houses two museums, the Alf Engen Ski Museum and the George Eccles Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Winter Games Museum. The Ski Museum contains more than 300 trophies, medals, uniforms, scrapbooks, skis, boots, photos, films and other collectibles that span some 70 years in the career of the Engen family. It also highlights Utah's rich ski history and the Wasatch Range, along with efforts made by the U.S. Forest Service to help develop Utah's ski resorts, and an exhibit on Utah's winter weather. The 2002 Winter Olympic Museum, currently located on the second floor of the center, includes athletic equipment used during the games, Olympic medals (and a display on how they were created), costumes and puppets used during the ceremonies, many of the officially licensed pins produced for the games, a photo op at an Olympic torch mounted in front of a large photo of the cauldron, along with video clips and other memorabilia.

It was written and directed by Kim Sang-woo and stars Uhm Jung-hwa as Min Joon and Daniel Henney as Robin Heiden.http://www.asianmovieweb.com/en/reviews/seducing_mr._perfect.htm Plot summary Min-june (Uhm Jung-hwa) is a believer in true love and always very dedicated to her current boyfriend. However, men always break up with her - her latest boyfriend ends their relationship on his birthday. Distracted by the latest break-up, she bumps into a car and a man steps out of it - who turns out to be her new boss, Robin Heiden (Daniel Henney). Heiden has very clear ideas about a relationship and love: both are a game of power and Min- june seeks advice from him, as she doesn't want to get dumped again. However, when she starts to treat men like Heiden treats women, she realizes that she prefers her older behavior, even if that means that she gets dumped again; she doesn't see love as a game of power and never will. Heiden, who has to deal with his own heartbreak, as he loved a woman so much that she had to shoot him to get the message across that she wasn't interested in him, starts to soften at Min-june's attitude towards life. He eventually falls in love with her and both get into a real relationship and a happy ending of their own. Instead of trying to make her understand that love is a game of power, he learned from her that love is the purest language of hearts; no need of rehearsals, judgements, hidings at all. One of the unique concepts of the movie is that Robin Heiden speaks only English because he finds Korean hard to speak, while Min-june speaks mostly in Korean. The two seem to understand each other perfectly without any outside translation, although in the film it is explained that Heiden understood Korean but has difficulty speaking it. This was a new style of dialogue for Korean films, and it is partially credited for the film's success.

Wigley studied at the School of Fine Arts in North Adelaide with F. Millward Grey. During 1939 he spent time with his old school friend, the anthropologist, Ronald Berndt, at Murray Bridge, where he completed a series of portrait drawings of local people. He moved to Melbourne in 1941 where he joined an army survey regiment, then a unit making relief maps and model aeroplanes used to train officers. Wigley exhibited in the 1942 Anti-Fascist exhibition held in Melbourne where he became friends with Noel Counihan and other social realist painters and writers. After his discharge from the army in 1943 he travelled to the Northern Territory to join Ronald Berndt at Daly River. During this time he completed a number of drawings of outback camp life. Following his return to Melbourne and two years of art study at the National Gallery School in an army rehabilitation course, Wigley travelled to Europe with fellow artist Yosl Bergner. He exhibited in Paris, at the Galerie Gentil Hommiere, and in London, before returning to Melbourne in 1953. In 1956 Wigley went to Port Hedland in the North West to work with Donald McLeod and the Aborigines of the region in an Aboriginal workers' co-operative, living independently by mining and pearl shell gathering. During 1974 the group purchased a sheep station in the Pilbara and established an independent school. In developing this school, Wigley worked the offset press to print all material needed for a multi-lingual school, and illustrated and designed the readers' books. In 1979 Wigley returned to Melbourne to paint and draw. In 1991 he returned to the Northern Territory for a short period, where his son, Julian, was working with Aboriginal communities. A survey of his work was held at the Niagara Galleries in 1992. He continued to paint until his death in 1999. Selected bibliography * Encyclopedia of Australian Art.

It was founded in 1972 by Carla Bley and Michael Mantler as a means of distributing artist produced recordings of, primarily, experimental contemporary music. It was a program of the Jazz Composer's Orchestra Association (JCOA). The NMDS began by distributing recordings released by many different independent labels and artists, including Nodlew (Weldon Irvine's label), Jahari (Richard Dunbar's label), Gibex (Michael William Gilbert's label), Philip Glass's Chatham Square label, and many others. Several international labels such as Incus and ECM were also included in their catalogs. The biggest selling album in NMDS history was the ECM release of Return to Forever (Chick Corea album), which strained the seams at the service and led to ECM's first US major distribution deal. The service maintained a philosophy of keeping all labels in stock at all times. Carla Bley remembered being rejected by the gatekeepers at traditional record companies and vowed that NMDS would be non-judgemental for the artists. In 1984, the NMDS was awarded a $10,000 grant by the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation. Due to the long illness of a manager, and the resultant failure to pay New York state taxes, NMDS suspended operations in 1990.

Controversy In her appointment as Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister, Xingwana caused controversy in 2007 when she accused white farmers of being cruel and inhumane towards their workers. She claimed that farmers regularly \\"rape and assault\\" their workers. These statements enraged many farmers, and two farm unions, AgriSA and the Transvaal Agricultural Union, challenged her to provide evidence that would support her accusations. The minister called for a meeting with the unions, but the farmers walked out in protest. Former President Thabo Mbeki was called in to resolve the dispute. =Executive toilet= In April 2009, a report in the Afrikaans newspaper Rapport repeated details found by one of its readers in a three-page Land Affairs document of a special mobile toilet, imported at R500,000, for Xingwana's exclusive use while handing over land in various parts of the country. Its specifications were said to include gold trimmings, but Xingwana's spokesperson denied the claim, declaring that, although Xingwana did indeed have a specially-reserved toilet, it was no different from those which played host to the hoi polloi.Scott, John. \\"Other mobile loo ideas for Lulu to use.\\" Cape Times, 22 April 2009 =Homophobic remarks= In March 2010 Lulu Xingwana stormed out of an art exhibition that she was attending in her capacity of minister of Arts and Culture, calling the work 'immoral'.

The game's prominent feature is its setting; contrary to a regular save-the-world plot in a high fantasy setting, the story of Moon Whistle unfolds mostly in a fictionalized modern Japanese city completed with original chip sets and character sprites. Much like the Mother series, most of main characters are preteen children. Their wielding weapons are everyday items and toys, they wear casual clothing or mascot costumes instead of a piece of armor, and monsters they fight include weird ones like burner/tripod monsters and iron frogs. The entire music was composed for the game by the pseudonym Saia Hy≈çseki (Ê∞∑Áü≥ÂΩ©‰∫ú). Basically its story revolves around a kindergarten-aged boy, Zenon („Åú„ÅÆ„Çì), and his friends, while it also focuses on topics like alienation mainly from the viewpoint of another lead character, X Ranger (X„É¨„É≥„Ç∏„É£„Éº). Zenon generally does not speak lines but with a few exceptions. The whole story is divided into over 20 small episodes, every of which takes place in a day. Once the player is finished with a day, the next day featured continues. Gameplay While unique in appearances, its gameplay is a customary one for a role-playing game; buying items in shops, equipping gadgets, random encounters, boss battles, leveling up, explorations, communicating with townspeople, and so forth. Its battle system is the default one of RPG Tsuk≈´ru 95 so that battles are operated in a front-view, turn-based fashion that resembles to that of SNES Dragon Quest games. Plot Set in Motomachi Town („ÇÇ„Å®„Åæ„Å°„Çø„Ç¶„É≥), a fictional 1980s Japanese suburb, the story begins on Zenon's first school day following spring vacation. After school, he goes to a hill in the town together with Narumi looking for X-Ranger, a superhero in a children's TV show, who allegedly appears in Motomachi Town for some reason. After meeting a man in X-Ranger's costume, Zenon and Narumi fight a bad monster in the hill in hope of helping him. Thanks to this, Zenon becomes popular enough with school-age children to be invited to their \\"secret base\\" to join them. Later Zenon and the gang happen to visit X-Ranger's hideout, and touch the panel of a giant machine sitting in there without his consent. Then they find themselves in a strange town, where they save Zeta („ÉÑ„Çß„Éº„Çø) from Hart („Éè„É´„Éà), a spoiled mean child, and are befriended with him. Once prohibited to use the machine by X-Ranger, later they are allowed to go between two cities. A cat-like creature, Max („Éû„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ), is also acquainted with them. After some events, Zeta notices that Zenon's town is very similar to his, Motomachi City („ÇÇ„Å®„Åæ„Å°„Ç∑„ÉÜ„Ç£), and questions X-Ranger on it. He reveals that he is a 19-year-old Zenon who came from the future (Motomachi City) to his past (Motomachi Town) by a time machine in order to recover hopes and dreams of people. Eidos („Ç®„Ç§„Éâ„Çπ), a Priest of Time (ÊôÇ„ÅÆÁ•ûÂÆò), later confronts X-Ranger claiming that X-Ranger's action causes the timeline to shift, as well as Max, who, being also a Priest of Time, helped X-Ranger complete a time machine. In autumn, a new toy Rocket Monster („É≠„Ç±„ÉÉ„Éà„É¢„É≥„Çπ„Çø„Éº) has become a fad among kids in Motomachi City. However, suddenly one of them goes berserk, and it results in severe criticism to the product by parents. Zenon and his friends find out that it was plotted by Hart's father, who intended to damage the profits of his rival firm by harming repute of their product, Rocket Monster. In consequence, Rocket Monster has succeeded in recovering its status. After the next year began, people in Motomachi City suddenly all got melancholic. Zenon and his friends investigate the case, and fight with X Ranger's shadow. After the battle, X-Ranger realizes that this world is not real and he in reality is presumably unconscious for an attempted suicide. Also, this dream world was shared by Hart in reality. He acquires in his dream immense power, and challenges Zenon and Zeta again, only to be defeated. Out of grudge, he destroys Sphere („Çπ„Éï„Ç£„Ç¢), enshrined in the Realm of Time (ÊôÇ„ÅÆÁ•ûÊÆø), which maintains the order of worlds, while the master of the Shrine, Volatilis („Éú„É©„ÉÜ„Ç£„É´), restores it in exchange for his life. Despite this, still Sphere was split in two. Since Sphere was broken, Zenon was no longer able to access to the future. X-Ranger decides to return to his reality, and together with Zenon, visits the Realm of Time to challenge the Final Trial, in which X-Ranger faces his surrounding problems. At the end of the Trial, Volatilis' spirit awaits to kill Zenon so as to extinguish the world of the dream. With the help of X Ranger, however, Zenon and his friends defeat Volatilis. After this, X-Ranger and Max return to each place. In March, Zenon and Narumi attend the graduation ceremony of their kindergarten. Off-shoots As a spin-off of Moon Whistle, was released in April 2003, which, at that time, was developed by the use of RPG Tsuk≈´ru 2000. was the omnibus of six short RPGs accomplished with RPG Tsuk≈´ru for Mobile and provided by Enterbrain via NTT Docomo's i-appli service.
