Function  Together, Ku70 and Ku80 make up the Ku heterodimer, which binds to DNA double-strand break ends and is required for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. It is also required for V(D)J recombination, which utilizes the NHEJ pathway to promote antigen diversity in the mammalian immune system. In addition to its role in NHEJ, Ku is also required for telomere length maintenance and subtelomeric gene silencing. Ku was originally identified when patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were found to have high levels of autoantibodies to the protein. Aging Mouse embryonic stem cells with homozygous Ku70 mutations, that is Ku70‚àí/‚àí cells, have markedly increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation compared to heterozygous Ku70+/‚àí or wild-type Ku70+/+ embryonic stem cells. Mutant mice deficient in Ku70 exhibit early aging. Using several specific criteria of aging, the mutant mice were found to display the same aging signs as control mice, but at a considerably earlier chronological age. These results suggest that reduced ability to repair DNA double-strand breaks causes early aging, and that the wild-type Ku70 gene plays an important role in longevity assurance.Bernstein H, Payne CM, Bernstein C, Garewal H, Dvorak K (2008).

The expulsion was ordered by NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria after approval by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, as a part of a Soviet forced settlement program and population transfer that affected several million members of non-Russian Soviet ethnic minorities between the 1930s and the 1950s. The deportation was prepared from at least October 1943 and 19,000 officers as well as 100,000 NKVD soldiers from all over the USSR participated in this operation. The deportation encompassed their entire nations, as well as the liquidation of the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The demographic consequences of this eviction were catastrophic and far reaching: of the (according to Soviet archives; Chechen sources put the deportees at 650,000) 496,000 Chechens and Ingush who were deported, at least a quarter perished. In total, the archive records show that over a hundred thousand people died or were killed during the round-ups and transportation, and during their early years in exile in the Kazakh and Kyrgyz SSR as well as Russian SFSR where they were sent to the many labor camps in the forced settlements. Chechen sources claim that 400,000 perished presuming a higher number of deportees. Chechens suffered a higher proportional loss of life than any other ethnic group persecuted by population transfer in the Soviet Union. Chechens were under administrative supervision of the NKVD officials during that entire time. The exile lasted for 13 years and the survivors would not return to their native lands until 1957, after the new Soviet authorities under Nikita Khrushchev reversed many of Stalin's policies, including the deportations of nations. A local report indicated that some 432,000 Vainakhs had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR by 1961, though they faced many obstacles while trying to settle back to the Caucasus, including unemployment, lack of accommodation and ethnic clashes with the local Russian population. Eventually, the Chechens and Ingush recovered and regained the majority of the population. This eviction left a permanent scar in the memory of the survivors and their descendants. February 23 is today remembered as a day of tragedy by most of Ingushs and Chechens. Many in Chechnya and Ingushetia classify it as an act of genocide, as did the European Parliament in 2004. Historical background The Chechens and the Ingush speak languages that are closely related and have a degree of passive intelligibility, both being Vainakh languages. The Chechen-Russian conflict is one of the longest and most protracted conflicts in modern history, spanning three centuries. Its origins date back to 1785, when the Chechens fought against Russian expansionism into the Caucasus. The Caucasus War was fought between 1817 and 1864. The Russian Empire succeeded in annexing the area and subjugating its people, but also killed or deported numerous non-Russian peoples and was responsible for the Circassian genocide. The Circassians, the Ubykh and the Abaza were subsequently resettled to the Ottoman Empire. However, other Caucasus people were affected as well. There were up to 1.5 million Chechens in the Caucasus in 1847, but as a result of this war and ensuing expulsions, their number dropped to 140,000 in 1861, and then further to 116,000 in 1867. In 1865, at least 39,000 Chechens were exiled to the Ottoman Empire by the Russian Empire. left In spite of this, the Chechens intermittently demanded a restoration of their independence and rebelled again against the Russian Empire in 1878. During the era of the USSR, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Chechens rejected the collectivization and Sovietization policies of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. This social resistance was nicknamed the 'Chechen problem'. During this time, Moscow constantly changed their territory, until the Chechen and Ingush Autonomous Oblasts were merged into a single Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936. In 1940, another Chechen insurgency, led by Khasan Israilov, started in Galanchozh. It was partly inspired by the resistance of Finns against the invading Soviets in the Winter War in 1939. In February 1942, Mairbek Sheripov's group rebelled in Shatoysky and Itum- Kalinsky Districts. They united with Israilov's army to rebel against the Soviet system. The Soviet Air Force bombarded the Chechen-Ingush republic in the spring of 1942 to suppress the rebellion. During World War II, the Soviet government accused Chechens and Ingush of cooperating with the Nazi invaders. The Nazis wanted to reach the Azerbaijan SSR, whose oil reserves were the goal of Case Blue (Fall Blau). On August 25, 1942, a group of German paratroopers, led by saboteur Osman Gube, landed near the village of Berezhki in the Galashkinsky district in order to organize anti-Soviet actions yet managed to only recruit 13 people in the area. The key period of the Chechen guerilla war started in August‚ÄìSeptember 1942, when German troops approached Ingushetia, and ended in the summer-autumn of 1943, with the Soviet counter-offensive that drove the Wehrmacht from the North Caucasus. There were some 20 million Muslims in the USSR, and the Soviet government feared that a Muslim revolt could spread from Caucasus to the whole of Central Asia. In August 1942, the Wehrmacht entered North Caucasus, seizing the Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics. It also encouraged anti-Sovietism among the local populace. However, the Nazis never reached Grozny and the only town in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR they briefly occupied was Malgobek, which was inhabited by Russians. Various historians, including Moshe Gammer, Ben Fowkes and Tony Wood, refute the Chechens' ties with the Germans, some pointing out that the Nazis stopped at the northwest outskirts of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, near Mozdok, in Northern Ossetia, and that a majority of the Vainakh never even came into contact with the German army. While there were secret negotiations with the Germans near this border, the Chechen rebels pointed out that they did not favor a rule from Berlin nor from Moscow. Sheripov reportedly gave the Ostministerium a sharp warning that \\"if the liberation of the Caucasus meant only the exchange of one colonizer for another, the Caucasians would consider this... only a new stage in the national liberation war\\". In October 1942, Chechens assisted other volunteers to help erect a defensive barrier around Grozny. Between December 1942 and March 1943, Chechens and Ingush contributed 12 million rubles to the Soviet defensive war. 17,413 Chechens joined the Red Army and were awarded 44 decorations while a further 13,363 joined the Chechen-Ingush ASSR People's Militia, ready to defend the area from an invasion. By contrast, Babak Rezvani points out that only about a 100 Chechens collaborated with the Axis powers. Deportation Destinations of the resettled Chechens and Ingush inside the Soviet Union On orders from Lavrentiy Beria, the head of the NKVD, the entire Chechen and Ingush population of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR were to be deported by freight trains to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The operation was called \\"Chechevitsa\\" (Operation Lentil), its first two syllables pointing at its intended targets. The operation is referred to by Chechens often as \\"Aardakh\\" (the Exodus). This operation was being prepared and planned since at least October 1943, and included Beria's two most trusted NKVD officers, Ivan Serov and Bogdan Kobulov. Beria complained to Stalin about the \\"low level of labour discipline\\" among Chechens, the \\"prevalence of banditry and terrorism\\", the \\"failure of Chechens to join the communist party\\" and the \\"confession of a German agent that he found a lot of support among the local Ingush\\". Beria then ordered to implement the operation. When Supian Kagirovich Mollaev, the leader of the local government in the Checheno-Ingush ASSR, heard about the decision, he burst into tears, but soon pulled himself together and decided to follow orders. The Chechen-Ingush Republic was never fully occupied by the Nazi army, but the repressions were officially justified by \\"an armed resistance to Soviet power\\". The charges of the Vainakh collaboration with the Nazis were never subsequently proven in any Soviet court. During World War II, 3,332,589 individuals were encompassed by Stalin's policies of deportations and forced settlements. Some of the stated reasons were allegedly to \\"defuse ethnic tensions\\", to \\"stabilize the political situation\\" or to punish people for their \\"act against the Soviet authority\\". According to the 1939 census, 407,690 Chechens and 92,074 Ingush were registered in the Soviet Union. On October 13, 1943, Operation Lentil commenced when about a hundred thousand troops and operative workers were moved into Checheno-Ingushetia, supposedly for mending roads and bridges. The soldiers even lived for a month inside the homes of the Chechens, who considered them guests. On February 20, 1944, Beria arrived to Grozny to supervise the operation. Map of the Chechen and Ingush regions of the Caucasus prior to the deportation On February 23, 1944 (on Red Army Day), the operation began. The NKVD troops went systematically from house to house to collect individuals. The inhabitants were rounded up and imprisoned in Studebaker US6 trucks, before being packed into unheated and uninsulated freight cars. The people were given only 15 to 30 minutes to pack for the surprise transfer. According to a correspondence dated March 3, 1944, at least 19,000 officers and 100,000 NKVD soldiers from all over the USSR were sent to implement this operation. Some 500 people were deported by mistake even though they were not Chechens or Ingush. The plan envisaged that 300,000 people were to be evicted from the lowland in the first three days, while in the following days the remaining 150,000 people living in the mountain regions would be next in line. Many times, resistance was met with slaughter, and in one such instance, in the aul of Khaibakh, about 700 people were locked in a barn and burned to death by NKVD General Mikheil Gveshiani, who was praised for this and promised a medal by Beria. Many people from remote villages were executed per Beria's verbal order that any Chechen or Ingush deemed 'untransportable should be liquidated' on the spot. This meant that the old, the ill and the infirm were to either be shot or left to starve in their beds alone. The soldiers would sometimes plunder the empty homes. An eyewitness recalled the actions of the NKVD forces: Sealed off freight cars were used to deport the Chechens and Ingush Those who resisted, protested or walked too slow were shot on the spot. In one incident, NKVD soldiers climbed up Moysty, a high mountain, and found 60 villagers there. Even though their commander ordered the soldiers to shoot the villagers, they fired in the air. The commander then ordered half of the soldiers to join the villagers and another platoon shot them all. 2,016 'anti-Soviet' people were arrested, and 20,072 weapons were confiscated in the operation. Throughout the North Caucasus, about 650,000 people (according to Dalkhat Ediev, 724,297) were deported in 1943 and 1944 by the Soviet forces. 478,479 people were forcibly resettled in the Aardakh: 387,229 Chechens and 91,250 Ingush. They were loaded onto 180 special trains, about 40 to 45 persons into each freight car. A combined total of 14,200 freight cars and 1,000 flat cars were used for this mass forcible transfer from February 23 to March 13, a rate of almost 350 freight cars per day. Some 40% to 50% of the deportees were children. The Chechens were the second most numerous repressed peoples in the USSR, after the Volga Germans. Tens of thousands of Kalmyks, Balkars, Meskhetian Turks and Karachays were also deported from the region. Only Chechen and Ingush women married to non- punished peoples were spared from the deportation. However, Russian women married to Chechen or Ingush men were subject to deportation unless they divorced. Their livestock was sent to kolkhozes in Ukrainian SSR, Stavropol Krai, Voronezh and Orel Oblasts. Many of these animals perished from exhaustion. Some 6,000 Chechens got stuck in the mountains of the Galanzhoy district due to the snow, but this slowed the deportation only minimally: 333,739 people were evicted, of which 176,950 were sent to trains already on the first day of the operation. Beriya reported that there were only six cases of resistance, 842 were \\"subject to isolation\\" while 94,741 were removed from their homes by 11 p.m. on the first day of the operation. Each family was allowed to carry up to 500 kg of personal belongings on the trip. The people were transported in cattle trains that were not appropriate for human transfer, lacking electricity, heating or running water. The exiles inside endured epidemics, which lead to deaths from infections or hunger. The transit to Central Asia lasted for almost a month. Some of the epidemics included typhus. One witness, who was seven years old at the time of her family's deportation, recalls that the wagons were so full of people that there was no space to move inside them. The exiles were given food only sporadically during the transit and did not know where they were being taken to. The wagons did not even stop for bathroom breaks: the passengers had to make holes in the floor to relieve themselves. The special trains traveled almost 2,000 miles and discharged the peoples into desolate areas of Central Asia, devoid of shelters or food. 239,768 Chechens and 78,479 Ingush were sent to the Kazakh SSR, whereas 70,089 Chechens and 2,278 Ingush arrived in Kirgiz SSR. Smaller number of the remaining deportees were sent to Uzbek SSR, Russian SFSR and Tajik SSR. The persecution of the Chechens did not stop there. In May 1944, Beria issued a directive ordering the NKVD to browse the entire USSR in search for any remaining members of that nation, \\"not leaving a single one\\". As a result, an additional 4,146 Chechens and Ingush were found in Dagestan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Krasnodar Krai, Rostov and Astrakhan Oblast. In April 1945, Beria was informed that 2,741 Chechens were deported from the Georgian SSR, 21 from the Azerbaijan SSR and 121 from Krasnodar Krai. In Moscow, only two Chechens managed to avoid eviction. All the Chechen and Ingush were discharged from the Red Army and sent to Central Asia as well. With these supplementary exiles, the number of the deported Chechens and Ingush grew to a total of 493,269. In July 1944, Beria reported an even higher figure to Stalin, claiming that a total of 496,460 Chechen and Ingush were deported. This ethnic cleansing operation was marked by an utter \\"culture of impunity\\". Many perpetrators of Operation Lentil were, in fact, even awarded the Suvorov First Class prize for arresting and capturing Chechens and Ingush. As with eight other \\"punished peoples\\" of the Soviet Union, the Chechens were put into the regime of special settlements. There was no barb wire around their compound, but any Chechen aged 16 or over had to report to the local NKVD officials each month. Those who tried to escape were sent to the gulag. This status of a special settler was supposed to be inherited by the children of the exiles. The exiles were assigned with the heaviest tasks, such as constructing sites, mines and factories in the most inhospitable places. The only compensation they received for their work was food coupons. They would be punished if they would not do any work assigned to them. Local authorities would act harshly towards them: sometimes they would beat the children of the Chechens to death. At Krasnoyarsk about 4,000 Chechens were assigned to forced labor camps. This, combined with malnutrition due to the negligence of the authorities to provide enough food for the newly arrived exiles, led to high death rates. The settlers were not provided with adequate accommodation: on September 1, 1944, only 5,000 out of the 31,000 families in Kirgiz SSR were provided with housing. One district prepared only 18 apartments for 900 families. Some exiles had to live in unheated tents. The Chechen children had to attend school in the local language, not their own. Several cases of rebellion were reported: in Krasnoyarsk in October 1954, some 4,000 Chechens managed to escape from a gulag concentration camp. The Soviet police found and killed half of them, but the other half managed to hide in the vast outdoors. Aftermath =Casualties and death toll= An Ingush family mourning the death of their daughter in Kazakhstan Many deportees died en route, and the extremely harsh environment of exile, especially considering the amount of exposure to thermal stress, killed many more. The temperatures in the Kazakh SSR would drop anywhere from during winter and then hit up to during summer. They travelled in wagons that were locked from the outside, without light or water, during winter. Trains would stop and open the wagons only occasionally to bury the dead in the snow. The local people at the train stations were forbidden to help the sick passengers or to give them any medicine or water. Some Russian sources claim that 1,272 people died during this transit. In 1948, there were 118,250 special settlers in Kazakh SSR \\"in extreme need in regard for food\\" and authorities reported thousands of children dying from undernourishment. Food rations were fixed at only 116 grams of flour and 56 grams of grain per day for each person, which was even below the standards of the captives in the Auschwitz concentration camp. (that standard being 300 grams of bread ( Iwaszko, Tadeusz (2000). \\"The Housing, Clothing and Feeding of the Prisoners\\". In D≈Çugoborski, Wac≈Çaw; Piper, Franciszek (eds.). Auschwitz, 1940‚Äì1945. Central Issues in the History of the Camp. Volume II: The Prisoners‚ÄîTheir Life and Work. O≈õwiƒôcim: Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. pp. 60-61 ) The local authorities in Kyrgyzstan set up enough supplies for only four months. One mother tried to make soup out of grass for her children. According to official Soviet reports, 608,749 Chechen, Ingush, Karachay and Balkars were registered in exile in Central Asia by 1948. The NKVD gives the statistic of 144,704 people who died in 1944‚Äì48 alone: a death rate of 23.7% per all these groups. 101,036 Chechens, Ingush and Balkars died in Kazakhstan and 16,052 in Uzbekistan. Another archive record shows that 104,903 of the deported Chechens died by 1949. This means that their group suffered the highest death toll of all the deported peoples within the Soviet Union. Professor Jonathan Otto Pohl estimates the combined number of deaths among Chechen and Ingush exiles during transit and confinement in special settlements by 1949 at 123,000. Out of these deaths, Chechens comprised 100,000 and Ingush 23,000. Thomas McDonell also gives a figure of at least 100,000 Chechens who died from starvation and diseases in exile, but does not give a figure for the Ingush casualties. Tom K. Wong, Associate Professor of Political Science, estimates that at least 100,000 Vainakhs died in the first three years in exile, excluding those who perished during the transit and the round-ups. Historian William Flemming released calculations giving a minimum of 132,000 Chechens and Ingush who died between 1944 and 1950. In comparison, their number of births in that period was only 47,000. Thus, the Chechen and ingush population fell from 478,479 in 1944 to 452,737 in 1948. From 1939 to 1959, the Chechen population grew by 2.5%. In comparison, between 1926 and 1939, it grew 28%. Historian Alexander Nekrich stated that the net losses of Chechens between 1939 and 1959 (after allowing for wartime losses) were 131,000, and of Ingush 12,000. German journalist Lutz Kleveman determined that 150,000 people did not survive the first four years of winter cold in Central Asia. Estimates for the maximum deaths and demographic losses of the Chechen and Ingush range from about 170,000 to 200,000, thus ranging from a quarter of the total Chechen population to nearly a third being killed in those years. Chechen historians claim 400,000 perished in deportation and exile; using a presumably higher estimate for the number of deportees. The demographer Dalkhat Ediev, in a study of casualty figures for all ethnic groups that were singled out for \\"punishment\\" by Stalin, found that deaths due to the deportations included 125,500 of the Chechen deportees and 20,300 of the Ingush deportees, or 30.8% of the Chechens and 21.3% of the Ingush. Meanwhile, the short-term demographic losses are estimated at 51.1% for the Chechens and 47.9% for the Ingush. He estimates that the Chechen population dropped to a low of 285,000 and the Ingush to 78,800 people in October 1948. However, despite these heavy losses, the Chechens subsequently increased their fertility rates, which is seen by some as a manifestation of their resiliance and determination to survive. =Political, cultural, social and economic consequences= The Checheno-Ingush ASSR was dissolved and transformed into Grozny Oblast, which included also the Kizlyarsky District and Naursky Raion, and parts of it were given to North Ossetia (part of Prigorodny District), Georgian SSR and Dagestan ASSR. As a result, Georgian SSR \\"grew\\" from 69,300 to 76,400, North Ossetiya from 6,200 to 9,200 and Dagestan from 35,000 to 38,200 square kilometers. Names of repressed nations were totally erased from all books and encyclopedias. By the next summer, a number of Chechen and Ingush placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques were destroyed, and a massive campaign of burning numerous historical Nakh language books and manuscripts was near complete. Their villages were razed to the ground and their graveyards bulldozed. With the native population gone, the Chechen region experienced a huge lack of skilled workers: the local oil production industry dropped more than ten times in 1944 compared to 1943. On November 26, 1948, the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet issued a decree which sentenced the deported nations to a permanent exile in those distant regions. This decree was not only mandatory for Chechens and Ingush, but also for Crimean Tatars, Germans, Balkars and Kalmyks. The settlers were not allowed to travel beyond three kilometers of their new place of residence. The authorities also prohibited any public mention or documentation of the deportations and its murders. Thousands of historical Vainakh texts, along with their origins, were lost when the Russians destroyed the public and private library of the peoples of Chechnya. The settlers were the target of various provocations in the Kazakh SSR: in December 1954, students in Elizavetinka taunted the Chechens as \\"traitors and betrayers of motherland\\". In May 1955, a worker in a coal mine engaged in a fight with a Chechen colleague in Ekibastuz. This escalated into a pogrom in which Russian hooligans even attacked a police station which sheltered the runaway Chechens. Many refugees from the Soviet Union were moved to the empty homes, including Russians, Ukrainians, Avars and Ossetians. As a consequence of this, the Russians comprised 49% of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR by 1959. By one report dated April 8, 1957, there were 415,000 Chechen and Ingush living in the Kazakh and Kyrgyz SSR, or 90,000 families. 38,500 were employed in the industry, 91,500 in agriculture, 25,000 in offices. =Return= In 1953, the three architects of the deportation perished: shortly after Stalin died on March 5, Beria and Kobulov were arrested on June 27, 1953. They were convicted on multiple charges, sentenced to death and executed on December 23, 1953. However, these charges were unrelated to the crimes of deportations and were merely a ploy to remove them from power. Nikita Khrushchev became the new Soviet leader and revoked numerous deportations, even denouncing Stalin. In his secret speech on February 24, 1956, Khrushchev condemned these Stalinist deportations: Vainakhs returning to the Caucasus in 1957 On July 16, 1956 the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet adopted a decree lifting the restrictions of the legal status of Chechens, Ingush and Karachais in the special settlements. In January 1957, the Soviet Council of Ministers passed a decree allowing repressed nations to freely travel in the Soviet Union. The Chechens and Ingush were thereby rehabilitated. Their exile lasted 13 years. Some started slowly returning to the Caucasus already in 1954, but were sent back by the authorities. During 1956 alone, between 25,000 and 30,000 Chechens and Ingush returned to their homeland, some even carrying the bodies of their relatives. The Soviet government tried to give them autonomy inside Uzbekistan or to resettle them in other parts of the Caucasus, but the returnees were adamant to return to their native lands. Over 50,000 families returned in 1957. By 1959, Chechens and Ingush already comprised 41% of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. 58.2% of Chechens and 45.3% of Ingushetians returned to their native lands by that year. By 1970, this peaked with 83.0% of all Chechens and 72.1% of all Ingush being registered in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. However, this distribution fell to 76.8% and 69.0%, respectively, by 1989. In comparison, 91.9% of all Chechens and 91.9% of all Ingush were concentrated in their titular republic in 1926. However, some Chechens stayed in Kyrgyzstan: some were afraid of the harsh long trip, some lacked the money to travel. By 2010, there were still a 100,000 Chechens living in Kazakhstan. When the Chechens and Ingush returned to their homeland, they found their farms and infrastructure had deteriorated. Some of the mountain regions were still a restricted zone for the returnees, which meant they had to settle in the lowlands. Worse still, they found other peoples living in their homes, and viewed these other ethnicities (Ossetians, Russians, Laks, and Avars) with hostility. Some Laks, Darghins and Avars had to be moved back to Dagestan, where they came from. Conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush in Prigorodny were sparked. The massive numbers of Vainakhs who were coming back to the Northern Caucasus took the locals by surprise: the Soviet government thus decided to temporarily halt the influx of returnees in the summer of 1957. Many Chechens and Ingush sold their homes and belongings, and quit their jobs to be able to return. A renewed ethnic conflict between Chechens and Russians was also on the rise. The Russians, angered by issues over land ownership and job competition, rioted as early as 1958. The 1958 riot was sparked by a fight between a Russian sailor and an Ingush youngster over a girl in which the Russian was fatally injured. In the next four days, the Russians formed mob riots and looted the Vainakh property, seizing government buildings and demanding either a restoration of Grozny Oblast, or a creation of a non- titular autonomy, re-deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, establishment of \\"Russian power\\", mass search and disarming of Chechens and Ingush, before Soviet law enforcement dispersed the rioters. Although the riot was dispersed and denounced as \\"chauvinistic\\", afterward the republican government made special efforts to please the Russian populace, including mass discrimination against the Chechens aimed at preserving the privileged position of the Russians. Map of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR from 1957 to 1991 In 1958, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was officially restored by a decree direct from Moscow, but in previous 1936 borders. North Ossetia kept the Psedakh and Prigorodny District, Georgian SSR kept the Daryal Gorge, amounting to 1/6 of lost land for Ingushetia, while the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was \\"compensated\\" with the Itum- Kalinsky and Prigorodny Districts from the Georgian SSR. This was done to dissipate the demographic impact of the 419,000 Vainakh returnees on Russians who moved there. By 1989, the 750,000 Chechens already comprised a majority (55%) of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, while 300,000 Russians comprised 22% and 163,700 Ingush 12% of the population. Chechens started to gain control by the 1970s. Ultimately, the attempt to make Checheno-Ingushetia more multi-ethnic in order to discourage potential uprisings failed due to the higher birthrate of the Vainakhs. A local report from 1961 indicated that out of 524,000 Vainakhs, 432,000 had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, 28,000 to Dagestan and 8,000 to North Ossetia. However, ethnic clashes continued even in the 1960s: in 1965 alone, 16 such clashes were recorded, resulting in 185 injuries and 19 fatalities. Chechens were greatly disadvantaged after being allowed to return. There were no Chechen-language schools, leading to a lack of education of the populace (which did not universally understand Russian). According to sociologist Georgi Derluguyan, the Checheno-Ingush Republic's economy was divided into two spheres, in which the Russian sphere had all the jobs with higher salaries in the urban areas: no Chechen cadre was promoted to a top position all until 1989. In the 1960s, in order to finance their families, some forty thousand men temporarily migrated from Chechen-Ingushetia each year to find part-time jobs in Kazakhstan and Siberia, thanks to their contacts from the time of their exile. On paper, the Chechen-Ingush Republic enjoyed the same privileges as other Soviet ASSRs, but in reality it had very little actual Chechens or Ingush representing its government, which was run directly by the Russians. Despite being rich with oil, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR remained the second poorest region of the entire USSR. Yusup Soslambekov, a chairman of the Chechen parliament after 1991, lamented that his people returned from exile to their homes \\"not as masters of that land but as mere inhabitants, tenants. Other people took our jobs in our factories\\". Remembrance and legacy Postcard with the image of the Memorial to the Victims of the Deportation of 1944. The inscription on the wall means: \\"We will not weep! We will not break! We will not forget!\\" The deportation left a permanent scar in the memory of the Chechens and is today regarded by some historians as \\"one of the most significant ethnic traumas of the Soviet period\\". Some descendants of the peoples of the North Caucasus are even today in fear of a new deportation. One historian named it \\"the central defining event in modern Chechen history\\". It also played a role in the Chechen mistrust at the Kremlin and a partial motivation for the subsequent declaration of independence in 1991 and the First and Second Chechen War in the 1990s and 2000s. For instance, insurgent Shamil Basayev referred to his 40 relatives who died during the deportation while Aslan Mashadov, the President of Ichkeria, stated that February 23 remains \\"one of the most tragic dates for his people\\" and that the goal of the Russian government has always stayed the same: \\"Chechnya without Chechens\\". Historian Nikolay Bugay described the deportation as a \\"perversion of Lenin's national policy and a direct disregard for the constitutional rights of the peoples\\". Aukh on February 23, 2017 dedicated to the anniversary of deportation In 1991, Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev made political capital by, in a symbolic move, sending out officials to gather these lost gravestones (that had been used by the Soviets for the construction of pedestrian footpasses and foundations of pig pens), many of which had lost their original inscriptions, and to construct out of them a memorial in the center of Grozny. The memorial was made to symbolize both Chechen remorse for the past as well as the desire to, in the name of the dead ancestors, fashion the best possible Chechen Republic out of their land and work hard towards the future. It bears an engravement, reading: \\"We will not break, we will not weep; we will never forget.\\" Tablets bore pictures of the sites of massacres, such as Khaibakh. The memorial was damaged during the subsequent Russo-Chechen wars. It has been later moved and dismantled by Ramzan Kadyrov's pro-Russian government, sparking much controversy. = Genocide question = Meeting in Strasbourg on February 23, 2017 dedicated to the anniversary of deportation Some think that this deportation constitutes an act of genocide according to the IV Hague Convention of 1907 and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of the U.N. General Assembly (adopted in 1948), including French historian and expert on communist studies Nicolas Werth, German historian Philipp Ther, Professor Anthony James Joes, American journalist Eric Margolis, Canadian political scientist Adam Jones, professor of Islamic History at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth Brian Glyn Williams, scholars Michael Fredholm and Fanny E. Bryan. Raphael Lemkin, a lawyer of Polish-Jewish descent who initiated the Genocide Convention, assumed that genocide was perpetrated in the context of the mass deportation of the Chechens, Ingush, Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks and Karachay. German investigative journalist Lutz Kleveman compared the deportation to a \\"slow genocide\\". In this case this was acknowledged by the European Parliament as an act of genocide in 2004: Experts of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum cited the events of 1944 for a reason of placing Chechnya on their genocide watch list for its potential for genocide. The separatist government of Chechnya also recognized it as genocide. Members of the Chechen diaspora and their supporters promote February 23 as World Chechnya Day to commemorate the victims. The Chechens, along with the Ingush, Karachai and Balkars, are represented in the Confederation of Repressed Peoples (CRP), an organization that covers the former Soviet Union and aims to support and rehabilitate the rights of the deported peoples. = In popular culture = Memorial \\"9 towers\\" in Nazran built in memory of deportation Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's novel The Gulag Archipelago, published in 1973, mentioned the Chechens: \\"They are a nation that refused to accept the psychology of submission... I never saw a Chechen seek to serve the authorities, or even to please them\\". In 1977 Vladimir Vysotsky wrote the song –õ–µ—Ç–µ–ª–∞ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å (Letela zhizn) devoted to the deportation.–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –í—ã—Å–æ—Ü–∫–∏–π. –õ–µ—Ç–µ–ª–∞ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å. Anatoly Pristavkin wrote the 1987 novel The Inseparable Twins which deals with this deportation. Semyon Lipkin published the novel Dekada in 1983. Iunus Desheriev, a philologist of Chechen origin, published an autobiography about how he escaped the fate of his people thanks to assistance from Russian friends. On February 19, 1989, the Yaryksu- Auch village built a monument to the victims of Stalinism. The deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, as well as the struggle of contemporary Chechen and Ingush rebels, features in the 1995 novel Our Game by John le Carr√©. There is a description by one of the protagonists about the deportation, specifically to the Kazakh steppes. On February 23, 1997, the 9 towers memorial was unveiled in Nazran, devoted to the deportation.–ú–µ–º–æ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å –∂–µ—Ä—Ç–≤–∞–º —Ä–µ–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏–π The Chechen-Russian film Ordered to Forget (–ü—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ –∑–∞–±—ã—Ç—å) by Hussein Erkenov was released in 2014 and depicts the 1944 Khaibakh massacre of the Chechens.

A native of the nation of Colombia and educated at Columbia University, Goez opened the Pomander Book Shop in 1975.

Somewhat to Goez's chagrin, the Pomander became a popular resource for film and theatre set dressers, who would describe their characters and settings to Goez, so that he could compile visually appropriate book collections for their sets.

Career Dewey Robinson was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1898, and made his Broadway debut in 1922 in the melodrama The Last Warning, which ran for seven months and 238 performances. Several years later, in 1925, he appeared in a comedy, Solid Ivory, his final Broadway production. In 1931, Robinson, a big, barrel-chested man at who easily conveyed physical menace, made his first film when he played a waiter in George Cukor's Tarnished Lady, starring Tallulah Bankhead. That performance did not receive screen credit, and this was often the case over Robinson's career, although he was in the billed main cast in Murder on the Campus (1934), Navy Secrets (1939) and There Goes Kelly (1945). Because of his size and physical presence, Robinson worked often during periods when gangster movies were the rage.Erickson, Hal, Allmovie biography Notable early roles for Robinson include a polo-playing hood in Little Giant (1933) starring Edward G. Robinson, a supervisor of slaves in Eddie Cantor's Roman Scandals that same year, and the Ben Turpin short Keystone Hotel in 1935. In the 1940s, Robinson was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial \\"stock company\\" of character actors, appearing in eight films written and directed by Sturges.Robinson appeared in The Great McGinty, Christmas in July, Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, Hail the Conquering Hero, The Great Moment, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock and The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend, Sturges' last American film. In 1950, near the end of his career, Robinson played a Brooklyn Dodgers fan in The Jackie Robinson Story who progressed from bigotry to exuberant support of Jackie Robinson. Robinson died in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 11, 1950, from a heart attack, but because he worked so prolifically, films in which he appeared continued to be seen until 1952, when At Sword's Point, a Musketeer adventure, was released. He was cremated.Resting Places Selected filmography * Tarnished Lady (1931) as Tony the Waiter (uncredited) * Enemies of the Law (1931) as Tony Catello * Six Hours to Live (1932) * The Woman from Monte Carlo (1932) * Blonde Venus (1932) (uncredited) * The Big Broadcast (1932) * The Little Giant (1933) * She Done Him Wrong (1933) * A Lady's Profession (1933) * Soldiers of the Storm (1933) * Laughing at Life (1933) * Notorious but Nice (1933) * Roman Scandals (1933) * Shadows of Sing Sing (1933) * Murder on the Campus (1934) * The Big Shakedown (1934) * Student Tour (1934) as Huan Lu (uncredited) * Palooka from Paducah (1935, Short) * One Run Elmer (1935, Short) * Pursuit (1935) * Keystone Hotel (1935, Short) * A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) * Too Tough to Kill (1935) * Missing Girls (1936) * All American Chump (1936) * Slave Ship (1937) * The 13th Man (1937) * New Faces of 1937 (1937) * Marry the Girl (1937) * The Toast of New York (1937) * Navy Secrets (1939) * Sky Bandits (1940) * The Great McGinty (1940) * Christmas in July (1940) (uncredited) * Tin Pan Alley (1940) * Sullivan's Travels (1941) (uncredited) * Isle of Missing Men (1942) * The Palm Beach Story (1942) * 'Neath Brooklyn Bridge (1942) * Casablanca (1942) as Bouncer at Rick's (uncredited) * The Woman of the Town (1943) * Timber Queen (1944) * Trocadero (1944) * San Diego, I Love You (1944) * Hail the Conquering Hero (1944) (uncredited) * Murder, My Sweet (1944) (uncredited) * The Great Moment (1944) (uncredited) * There Goes Kelly (1945) * Fashion Model (1945) * The Lady Confesses (1945) * Stairway to Light (1945 short) * Black Market Babies (1945) * Pardon My Past (1945) * The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) as Pedestrian (uncredited) * The Michigan Kid (1947) * Killer Dill (1947) * The Checkered Coat (1948) * River Lady (1948) * The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend (1949) (uncredited) * Hellfire (1949) * Buccaneer's Girl (1950) * The Jackie Robinson Story (1950) (uncredited) * Father of the Bride (1950) as Moving Man with lamp (uncredited) * At War with the Army (1950) * Skipalong Rosenbloom (1951) * At Sword's Point (1952) References External links  * Category:1898 births Category:1950 deaths Category:American male film actors Category:American male stage actors Category:Male actors from New Haven, Connecticut Category:20th-century American male actors ","title":"Dewey Robinson"},{"id":"14059707","text":"Farouk Muhammad Lawan (born July 6th,1962) is a Nigerian politician and four- term (since 1999) member of the House of Representatives for the Bagwai/Shanono Federal Constituency of Kano State.

Lawan was elected in 1999, 2003, 2007 and again in 2011, making it 4 times elected member. Lawan was the Chairman of the House Committee on Finance under the former Speaker Aminu Bello Masari. He identifies his legislative interests as \\"Appropriation, Information and Education\\". During the late-2007 corruption scandal that caused the former Speaker of the House Patricia Etteh to resign, Lawan led the Integrity Group, an alliance of Representatives opposed to Etteh. He is now considered a strong candidate for the governorship of Kano state. =Fuel Subsidy Scandal= In January 2012, Lawan chaired the House of Representatives committee that investigated the Nigerian government's fuel subsidies. The committee was set up in the wake of nationwide strikes in Nigeria after President Goodluck Jonathan removed a fuel subsidy. This resulted in the increase in price of fuel. The Committee's report released in April the same year revealed a huge scam in which Nigerian fuel companies were being paid hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies by the government for fuel that was never delivered. It was estimated the scam cost the country $6.8 million. In February 2013, Lawan was charged with corruption after he allegedly accepted $500,000 from Femi Otedola, a Nigerian billionaire oil tycoon, as part of a $3 million bribe Lawan had solicited from Otedola. Otedola claimed that Lawan demanded the bribe in order to have his company, Zenon, removed from the list of companies that the committee had implicated in the scandal. The initial fuel subsidy report said that Zenon owed more than $1 million to the government, but legislators later voted to remove the firm from the final report. Lawan said that he accepted the money in order to expose blackmail and informed the committee and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) about it.

He served as spokesman on energy for the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group, a member of the Environmental Protection Committee, substitute member of the Committee on Economics and Technology and substitute member of the Defence Committee. Together with Hermann Scheer, he authored the 2000 draft of the Renewable Energy Sources Act, establishing the foundation for the technology developments in photovoltaic, biogas, wind power and geothermal energy in Germany. Fell is founder and president of the Energy Watch Group and an internationally renowned energy and climate change advisor, author and speaker. Personal life Hans-Josef Fell was born on 7 January 1952 in Hammelburg, Germany. He graduated from Gymnasium Hammelburg in 1971. He studied Physics and Sport Sciences at the University of W√ºrzburg. Between 1977 and 1978 he did his civil service year in W√ºrzburg with special education children. After passing the state teacher's exam in 1980, Fell began teaching physics and physical education at Alexander-von-Humboldt Gymnasium in Schweinfurt. Fell and his wife live in Hammelburg and have three children. The family house is built according to ecological criteria and runs completely on renewable energy. Fell has won awards for his home, including the international \\"Solar-Oskar\\", the Energy Globe Award 2000. In 2015, he received The Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his continuous support of the German Energiewende. Political career Hans-Josef Fell joined the Green Party in 1992 following years of interest in renewable energy and environmental protection. Fell worked on the city council in his hometown of Hammelburg from 1990 until 1998 and from 1996 until 2003 he worked in the county council in the Bad Kissingen district. He has been a member of the German Parliament since 1998. Hans-Josef Fell supported the shift in military training methods towards conflict deescalation, particularly at the Bundeswehr base in Hammelburg. From 1999 to 2005, as spokesman of the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group on the German Bundestag‚Äôs research committee, Hans- Josef Fell helped to ensure an increase in funding for research into photovoltaics, concentrating solar power, geothermal energy, bioenergy, batteries for electric cars, bionics, nanotechnology and others. Hans-Josef Fell has initiated many technical assessment reports, which in some cases still offer important foundations for legislative developments today, for example: nanotechnology, geothermal energy, transport systems of the future, various medical issues such as research into the brain, nuclear fusion, and genetic engineering in agriculture and medicine. Hans-Josef Fell wrote the draft of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), which was adopted in 2000 in the face of strong political opposition. The law, enacted 25 February 2000, guarantees cost-covering feed-in tariffs for electricity from biomass, wind power, and solar power, and aimed to increase the percentage of renewable energy used in Germany to 12.5% by the year 2010 and 20% by 2020. In 2011, Germany was already generating 20% of its energy from renewable resources. He was also involved in drafting the law amending the EEG in 2004. Hans-Josef Fell initiated legislation exempting biofuels from tax, and was also actively involved in establishing the legislative framework for renewables at the European level. Hans-Josef Fell is the founder of the Energy Watch Group, a network of parliamentarians and independent researchers who conduct research on global energy developments and publish open-access studies to secure our global energy supply in a sustainable way.

She has been accused of distorting facts to push a narrative under the guise of neutral reporting. =Writing on bullying= Bazelon wrote a series on bullying and cyberbullying for Slate, called \\"Bull-E\\". She was nominated for the 2011 Michael Kelly Award for her story \\"What Really Happened to Phoebe Prince?\\" The three-part article is about the suicide of Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old girl who committed suicide in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in January 2010, and the decision by the local prosecutor to bring criminal charges against six teenagers in connection with this death. The Michael Kelly Award, sponsored by the Atlantic Media Co., \\"honors a writer or editor whose work exemplifies a quality that animated Michael Kelly's own career: the fearless pursuit and expression of truth.\\" Bazelon's series also sparked heated reaction and a response from district attorney Elizabeth Scheibel, who brought the charges against the six teenagers.

Discussing her view of Roe v. Wade in 1973, Ginsburg commented, \\"Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don't want to have too many of. So that Roe was going to be then set up for Medicaid funding for abortion.\\" Bazelon did not ask any follow-up question to what some interpreted as Ginsburg endorsing a eugenics-based rationale for legalized abortion, i.e., as a remedy for \\"populations that we don't want to have too many of\\". Bazelon was criticized by some conservative commentators for not doing so. Bazelon responded to the criticism, stating that she is \\"imperfect\\" and did not ask a follow-up question because she believed that Ginsburg's use of \\"we\\" had referred to \\"some people at the time, not [Ginsburg] herself or a group that she feels a part of.\\" The interview was cited in the United States House of Representatives' Committee Report in support of the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2012.

In addition, other categories of spend may fall under the ISP's scope such as maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) services. Firms that provide such services typically have a good understanding of their customers needs and are responsible for executing services in accordance with contract documents. Normally the scope of work (SOW) and the ISP contract are finalized only after an extensive due diligence period. As a service The ISP provider may be contracted to perform a function or consolidate any number of activities required to support the customer's needs. In any case, normally the primary goal of the ISP is to achieve an overall cost savings for the customer. ISP providers normally work closely with the customer's management team within a facility to provide strategic sourcing to cut costs. In addition, the ISP and the customer normally will use key performance indicators that provide constant feedback on the performance of the ISP program. ISP firms can manage single or multiple categories of spend, such as facility management services, as part of a total integrated scope of work. Management of an ISP contract is typically a joint effort with both sides designating an ISP Manager. These managers will normally have quarterly review meetings to review performance and feedback with the customer's facility management team. Managers will also develop and review strategies related to spend management. ISP firms may be required to hold certain permits or licenses in order to perform services. To obtain information on state requirements, a firm may check with the Contractor's License Reference website as well as the National Contractor's website. ISP provider example An organization would start an ISP program in order to achieve a specific cost savings for its manufacturing facility. An ISP provider is selected at the owner's facility to conduct due diligence and analyze prior year spend data. After a thorough analysis by both parties, a contract is developed to meet mutually agreed objectives. Typically a go-live date is set to begin services. At this point the ISP provider has made all the appropriate preparations to provide agreed services.

According to Dirk Moses' estimate, 20,000 children were abducted for such purposes from Poland, 20,000 from the Soviet Union, and 10,000 from western and southeastern Europe. Limited preview. Google Books. The aim of the project was to acquire and \\"Germanize\\" children with purportedly Aryan-Nordic traits, who were considered by Nazi officials to be descendants of German settlers that had emigrated to Poland. Those labeled \\"racially valuable\\" were forcibly Germanized in centres and then sent to German families and SS Home Schools. Background In a well-known speech to his military commanders at Obersalzberg on 22 August 1939, Adolf Hitler condoned the killing without pity or mercy of all men, women, and children of Polish race or language. On 7 November 1939, Hitler decreed that Heinrich Himmler, whose German title at that time was Reichskomissar f√ºr die Festigung deutschen Volkstums, would be responsible for policy regarding the population of occupied territories. The plan to kidnap Polish children most likely was created in a document titled Rassenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP. On 25 November 1939, Himmler was sent a 40-page document titled (in English translation) \\"The issue of the treatment of population in former Polish territories from a racial-political view.\\" The last chapter of the document concerns \\"racially valuable\\" Polish children and plans to forcefully acquire them for German plans and purposes: On 15 May 1940, in a document titled (in German) Einige Gedanken ueber die Behandlung der Fremdenvoelker im Osten (\\"A Few Thoughts about the Treatment of Racial Aliens in the East\\"), and in another \\"top-secret memorandum with limited distribution, dated 25 May 1940\\", titled (in English translation) \\"The Treatment of Racial Aliens in the East\\", Himmler defined special directives for the kidnapping of Polish children. Himmler \\"also outlined the administration of incorporated Poland and the General Government, where Poles were to be assigned to compulsory labor, and racially selected children were to be abducted and Germanized.\\" Among Himmler's core points: *In the territory of Poland, only four grade schools would remain, in which education would be strictly limited. Children would be taught to count only to 500, to write their own name, and that God commanded Poles to serve Germans. Writing was determined to be unnecessary for the Polish population. *Parents who desired better education for their children would have to apply to the SS and police for a special permit. The permit would be awarded to children deemed \\"racially valuable\\". Those children would be taken to Germany to be Germanised. Even then, the fate of each child would be determined by the loyalty and obedience to the German state of his or her parents. A child determined to be \\"of little racial value\\" would not receive any further education. *Annual selection would be made every year among children from six to ten years of age according to German racial standards. Children deemed adequately German would be taken to Germany, given new names and further Germanised. The aim of the plan was to destroy \\"Polish\\" as an ethnic group, and leave within Poland a considerable slave population to be used up over the next 10 years. Within 15 to 20 years, Poles would be completely eradicated. On 20 June 1940, Hitler approved Himmler's directives, ordering copies to be sent to chief organs of the SS, to Gauleiters in German- occupied territories in Central Europe, and to the governor of General Government, and commanding that the operation of kidnapping Polish children in order to seek Aryan descendants for Germanisation be a priority in those territories. Himmler mused on initiating similar projects in German-occupied France.Hitler, Adolf; Weinberg, Gerhard L. (2007). Hitler's table talk, 1941-1944: his private conversations, p. 303. Enigma Books. Hitler's Table Talk records him expressing his belief that \\"the French problem\\" would be best solved by yearly extractions of a number of racially healthy children, chosen from \\"France's Germanic population\\". He preferred they be placed in German boarding schools, in order to separate them from their \\"incidental\\" French nationality, and to make them aware of their \\"Germanic blood\\". Hitler responded that the \\"religious petit-bourgeois tendencies of the French people\\" would make it almost impossible to \\"salvage the Germanic elements from the claws of the ruling class of that country\\". Martin Bormann believed it to be an ingenious policy, noting it in the document record as a [sic] \\"sinister theory!\\". Conditions of transfer Kidnapping of Polish children during the Nazi-German resettlement operation in Zamo≈õƒá county. The conditions of transfer were very harsh, as the children did not receive food or water for many days.Richard C. Lukas, Forgotten Holocaust p. 22, . Many children died as a result of suffocation in the summer and cold in the winter. Polish railway workers, often risking their lives, tried to feed the imprisoned children or to give them warm clothes. Sometimes the German guards could be bribed with jewelry or gold to allow the supplies to go through, and in other cases they sold some of the children to Poles. In Bydgoszcz and Gdynia, Poles bought children for 40 Reichsmarks. In some places the German price for a Polish child was 25 zlotys. The children were kidnapped by force, often after their parents had been murdered in concentration camps or shot as \\"partisans\\", including a handful of the children of Lidice.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 253-4 These children would not be permitted to remain even with other living relatives.Richard C. Lukas, Forgotten Holocaust p. 27, . Some were purportedly from German soldiers and foreign mothers, and others were declared \\"German orphans\\" who had been raised by non-German families. Limited preview. Google Books. Indeed, orphanages and children's homes, along with children living with foster parents, were among the first groups targeted, in the belief that Poles deliberately and systemically Polonized ethnically German children.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 244-5 Later the children were sent to special centres and institutions or to, as Germans called them, \\"children education camps\\" (Kindererziehungslager), which, in reality, were selection camps where their \\"racial values\\" were tested, their original metrics of birth destroyed, and their Polish names changed to German names, as part of Germanisation. Those children who were classified as \\"of little value\\" were sent to Auschwitz or to Treblinka. Selection Kinder-KZ inside Litzmannstadt Ghetto map signed with number 15; where Polish children were selected. The children were placed in special temporary camps of the health department, or Lebensborn e.V., called in German Kindererziehungslager (\\"children's education camps\\"). Afterwards they went through special \\"quality selection\\" or \\"racial selection\\" ‚Äî a detailed racial examination, combined with psychological tests and medical exams made by experts from RuSHA or doctors from Gesundheitsamt (health department). A child's \\"racial value\\" would determine to which of 11 racial types it was assigned, including 62 points assessing body proportions, eye colour, hair colour, and the shape of the skull. During this testing process, children were divided into three groups (in English translation): #\\"desired population growth\\" (); #\\"acceptable population growth\\" (); and #\\"undesired population growth\\" (). The failures that could result in a child, otherwise fitting all racial criteria, into the second group included such traits as \\"round-headed\\" referring to the skull shape.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 250 Children could be declared the third group for tuberculosis, \\"degenerate\\" skull shape, or for \\"Gypsy characteristics\\".Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 251 A girl who was later identified by a small birthmark would have been rejected had the birthmark been much larger.Gitta Sereny, \\"Stolen Children\\", rpt. in Jewish Virtual Library (American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise). Accessed September 15, 2008. (Reprinted by permission of the author from Talk [November 1999].) These racial exams determined the fate of children: whether they would be killed, or sent to concentration camps, or experience other consequences. For example, after forcibly taking a child away from his or her parents, \\"medical exams\\" could be performed in secret and in disguise. Many Nazis were astounded at the number of Polish children found to exhibit \\"Nordic\\" traits, but assumed that all such children were genuinely German children, who had been Polonized; Hans Frank summoned up such views when he declared, \\"When we see a blue-eyed child we are surprised that she is speaking Polish.\\" Among those children thought to be genuinely German were children whose parents had been executed for resisting Germanization. German documentation Once selected, the children between six and twelve were sent to special homes. Their names were altered to similar-sounding German ones.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 249 They were compelled to learn German and beaten if they persisted in speaking Polish. They were informed their parents were dead even if they were not. Children who would not learn German or remembered their Polish origin were sent back to youth camps in Poland. In some cases, the efforts were so successful that the children lived and died believing themselves to be Germans. The authorities were reluctant to let the children be officially adopted, as the proceedings might reveal their Polish origin. Indeed, some children were maltreated when their adoptive parents learned that they were Polish. Adoption was also problematic because surveillance or more information might reveal problems with the child. When it was learned that Rosalie K's mother was epileptic, for instance, it was immediately concluded, despite the wishes of her German foster parents, that Germanization, education and adoption were therefore not justifiable.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 251-2 When adoptive parents demanded adoption certificates, such records were forged for them. German medical experiments Those children who did not pass harsh Nazi exams and criteria and who were therefore selected during the operation, were sent as test subjects for experiments in special centres. Children sent there ranged from eight months to 18 years. Two such centres were located in German-occupied Poland. One of them, Medizinische Kinderheilanstalt, was in Lubliniec in Upper Silesia ‚Äì in this centre children were also subject to forced \\"euthanasia\\"; while the second was located in Cieszyn. Children were given psychoactive drugs, chemicals and other substances for medical tests, although it was generally known that the true purpose of those procedures was their mass extermination. Post-war repatriation efforts The extent of the program became clear to Allied forces over the course of months, as they found groups of \\"Germanized\\" children and became aware that many more were in the German population.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 501-2 Locating these children turned up their stories of forcible instruction in the German language and how the failures were killed.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 502 Teams were constituted to search for the children, a particularly important point when dealing with institutions, where a single investigator could only interview a few children before all the rest were coached to provide false information.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 505 Many children had to be lured into speaking the truth; as for instance complimenting their German and asking how long they had spoken it, and only when told that a nine-year-old had spoken German for four years, pointing out that they must have spoken before then, whereupon the child could be brought to admit to having spoken Polish.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 506 Some children suffered emotional trauma when they were removed from their adoptive German parents, often the only parents they remembered, and returned to their biological parents, when they no longer remembered Polish, only German. The older children generally remembered Poland; ones as young as ten had forgotten much, but could often be reminded by such things as Polish nursery rhymes; the youngest had no memories that could be recalled. Allied forces made efforts to repatriate them. However, many children, particularly Polish and Yugoslavian who were among the first taken, declared on being found that they were German.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 479 Russian and Ukrainian children, while not gotten to this stage, still had been taught to hate their native countries and did not want to return. While many foster parents voluntarily brought forth well-cared-for children, other children proved to be abused or used for labour, and still others went to great efforts to hide the children.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 508-9 After the war, The United States of America v. Ulrich Greifelt, et al., or the RuSHA Trial, the eighth of the twelve Nuremberg Trials, dealt with the kidnapping of children by the Nazis.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 507 Many children testified, although many of their parents were afraid to let them return to Germany.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 507-8 From 1947 to 1948, the Nuremberg Trials ruled that the abductions, exterminations, and Germanization constituted genocide. Only 10 to 15 percent of those abducted returned to their homes. When Allied effort to identify such children ceased, 13,517 inquiries were still open, and it was clear that German authorities would not be returning them.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 513 Statistics Between 1940 and 1945, according to official Polish estimates, approximately 200,000 Polish children were abducted by the Nazis.Nowa Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN (Warsaw: Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, 2004), 2: 613. . The actual figure was significantly less, estimated by Tara Zahra to be around 20,000‚Äì50,000 for all of Eastern Europe. According to Dirk Moses' estimate, 20,000 children were abducted for such purposes from Poland, 20,000 from the Soviet Union, and 10,000 from western and southeastern Europe. Additional non-German-speaking children were evacuated along with German civilians, while tens of thousands of foreign children were recruited as forced laborers or born to female forced laborers in Germany. Confusion between ethnic German children from Eastern Europe and non-German children was another factor that led to inflated estimates. Memorials After the war, a memorial plate was made in Lublin dedicated to railway workers who tried to save Polish children from German captivity.

In the , Dalbeg had a population of 76 people. Geography Dalbeg farming community located inland from the townships of Ayr and Home Hill. Situated on the banks of the Burdekin River, it is a fertile area famous for growing sugar cane and vegetables. On many maps there appears to be a road crossing the Burdekin River at Dalbeg. In fact this was once a fording point. The earliest explorers coming from the Gulf region (The Plains of Promise) used Expedition Pass through the mountains to arrive at the banks of the Burdekin River at this fording point where they then crossed into Strathalbyn Station. The river can no longer be forded at this point. History The area was originally known as Akala until the Queensland Surveyor General changed the name to Dalbeg, the name of a pastoral run taken up by pastoralist James Hall Scott on 28 May 1863. Dalbeg Post Office opened on 1 December 1956 and closed in 1971. Dalbeg State School opened on 4 July 1955; it closed on 1999.

The mission of the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory is to promote the conservation of the birds of southeastern Arizona, their habitats, and the diversity of species that share those habitats through research, monitoring, and public education. The observatory's founders and current directors are Tom Wood and Sheri Williamson, former managers of The Nature Conservancy's Ramsey Canyon Preserve, and Mark Newstrom. Monitoring bird diversity Southeastern Arizona is at a biogeographic crossroads, where the Rocky Mountains meet the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico and the Chihuahuan Desert blends into the Sonoran Desert. Isolated mountain ranges known as \\"sky islands\\" are home to a variety of animal and plant species found nowhere else in the United States. The San Pedro River flows north from the mountains of northern Sonora, Mexico providing a highway for millions of migrating birds every spring and fall. The Santa Cruz River and Sonoita Creek also provide riparian habitat for breeding and migrating birds and other wildlife. Much of the best remaining wildlife habitat in the region is in the Coronado National Forest, national and state parks, national wildlife refuges and conservation areas, state wildlife areas, military reservations, and Nature Conservancy preserves. The Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory has conducted various monitoring projects both independently and in cooperation with public agencies. Its longest-running research project, in cooperation with the United States Bureau of Land Management and Friends of the San Pedro River, is a study of the hummingbirds that use the San Pedro River as a migratory corridor or breeding area.City of Sierra Vista, AZ YouTube channel: Hummingbird BandingDavis, Tony. \\"Tiny bird banded in AZ recaptured after humdinger of a flight\\", Arizona Daily Star, 2008-08-20. Banding sessions are open to the public, which has allowed thousands of visitors to observe research in progress and learn more about hummingbirds, other migratory birds, the ecological significance of the San Pedro River, and other conservation issues. Past projects include migration monitoring and breeding bird monitoring under the MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship) ProgramInstitute for Bird Populations: Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) Program for the National Park Service and Fish & Wildlife Service.

Ecotourism and outreach Southeastern Arizona consistently ranks as one of the top five birding locations in the United States. Tens of thousands of birders visit the area each year, making nature-based tourism an important asset to the regional economy. The area's natural attractions also lure active retirees and others interested in relocating to areas with diverse opportunities for outdoor recreation. To cultivate environmental awareness and advocacy among both residents and tourists, the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory offers bird walks, workshops, other educational activities in both Arizona and northwestern Mexico,Wilcove, David S. \\"Border Traffic: The challenge of saving Mexico‚Äôs vanishing Thick-billed Parrots\\".

Early life Singletary was born October 31, 1921 in Gulfport, Mississippi. He received his B.A. from Millsaps College in 1947 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Louisiana State University in 1949 and 1954, respectively. Academic career Singletary was an Instructor in Louisiana State University's Extension Division from 1949 to 1951, followed by a position with the Navy Supply Corps School in Bayonne, New Jersey, in 1951 and 1952, and in the Naval ROTC Unit at Princeton University from 1952 to 1954. In 1954, he took a position as an instructor in History at the University of Texas, before becoming an Assistant Professor (1957‚Äì58), Associate Professor (1959), and Professor (1960). He served as Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences, from 1956 to 1959, and Assistant to the President of the institution during the 1960-61 academic year. He served as Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro from 1961 to 1966, with a leave of absence from October, 1964, until January, 1966 to head the federal Job Corps. In 1968, he returned to Texas to serve as Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs in the University of Texas System. President of University of Kentucky In August 1969, Singletary became president of the University of Kentucky. Assuming his executive responsibilities during a period of campus turmoil kindled by student protest against the Vietnam War, and culminating on the UK campus following the Kent State shootings in May 1970. Singletary's dispassionate yet firm approach to dealing with the conflict, in time effectively restored calm to the campus and prevented a potentially incendiary situation from spinning out of control. Throughout his term Singletary listened attentively to student concerns and encouraged responsible student participation in university affairs. Early in his administration student representation on the Board of Trustees was initiated, and student membership in the University Senate was increased. As a result, many causes of student discontent were eradicated, and a mutuality of trust and respect between students and administrators developed and grew during the Singletary years. Singletary retired from his post as president of the university on June 30, 1987, having served longer in that position than any of his predecessors, save James Kennedy Patterson and Frank McVey. Books Among his writings were Negro Militia and Reconstruction a treatise on the mixed race paramilitary units employed in the south during the post Civil War period. This volume examines the use, racial mixture and failures surrounding a group of civil servants who faced a high rate of violence. Legacy In the same year of his retirement, the University of Kentucky's Singletary Center for the Arts was named in his honor. Currently, the university offers the Singletary scholarship, which is the highest attainable undergraduate scholarship at the institution. He died September 20, 2003 at his home in Lexington, Kentucky. His funeral was held four days later at the Singletary Center for the Arts.

Bauhaus and after Born in Leipzig, Germany, Wildenhain‚Äôs early artistic training was in drawing, design and lithography. In February 1924, he enrolled at the Bauhaus in Weimar, where he completed the foundations or preparatory course under L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. He also studied with Paul Klee, and, beginning in November 1924, with Gerhard Marcks and Max Krehan at the Bauhaus pottery workshop in Dornburg. Among the other potters there was Marguerite Friedlaender, his future wife. When the Bauhaus moved to Dessau in 1925, pottery was dropped from its curriculum. Marcks moved to the State School of Applied Art at Burg Giebichenstein, Halle, where he soon became the director. The following year, when Friedlaender became the head of that school‚Äôs pottery workshop, Wildenhain moved with her to resume his student training there. He became a Master Potter in 1930, the same year in which they were married, after which she was professionally known as Marguerite Wildenhain. In 1933, when the Nazis took over Germany, Marguerite dismissed from her position, because of her Jewish ancestry. She and Frans then moved to Putten, the Netherlands, where they set up a pottery workshop called Het Kruikje (Little Jug). In March 1940, she was able to emigrate to the U.S. (just two months in advance of the German invasion of the Netherlands), but he (a non-Jewish German citizen) was not allowed to follow her. In 1941, he moved to Amsterdam, where he taught briefly at the Arts and Crafts School, and also studied sculpture with Jan Bronner at the Rijksacademie. By 1943, he had been drafted into the German Army, and in the following year took part in the Battle of Arnhem. In April 1945, he became a deserter and was hidden from authorities by friends in Amsterdam. Pond Farm In the months after her emigration to the U.S. in 1940, Marguerite had almost no word of the whereabouts of her husband. From May 10 (the day of the German invasion of the Netherlands) until September 10, 1940, she wrote unmailed letters to him, in the form of a diary, as she slowly worked her way across the U.S., from New York to California. These letters have since been published in Marguerite: A Diary to Franz Wildenhain edited by Dean Schwarz (2004). In 1942, she settled at Pond Farm, an artists‚Äô colony near Geurneville, California, established by Gordon and Jane Herr, who had been in contact with the Wildenhains in the Netherlands in 1939. After a separation of about seven years, Frans and Marguerite Wildenhain were finally reunited in 1947, when at last he was granted a visa. He too joined the community at Pond Farm, where he worked as an artist and teacher with his wife, fiber artist Trude Guermonprez, jewelry designer Victor Ries, and the Herrs. Later years By 1950, the Wildenhain‚Äôs marriage had fallen apart, and Frans then accepted an offer to join the faculty of the School of American Craftsmen (now School for American Crafts) at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, where he taught for 20 years. Among his graduate students were future noted ceramicist Ron Meyers \\"Ron Meyers: A Potter's Menagerie\\", for whom he served as MFA thesis advisor.\\"Ceramic hibachis and serving dishes\\".

It is characterized by two main treatment procedures ‚Äì imaginal and in vivo exposures. Imaginal exposure is repeated 'on-purpose' retelling of the trauma memory. In vivo exposure is gradually confronting situations, places, and things that are reminders of the trauma or feel dangerous (despite being objectively safe). Additional procedures include processing of the trauma memory and breathing retraining. Overview Dr. Edna Foa Prolonged exposure therapy was developed by Edna B Foa, Director of the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania. Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is a theoretically-based and highly effective treatment for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related depression, anxiety, and anger. PE falls under the category of \\"exposure-based therapy\\" and is supported by scientific studies which reflect its positive impact on patient symptoms. Exposure-based therapies focus on confronting the harmless cues/triggers of trauma/stress in order to unpair them from the feelings of anxiety and stress. Prolonged exposure is a flexible therapy that can be modified to fit the needs of individual clients. It is specifically designed to help clients psychologically process traumatic events and reduce trauma- induced psychological disturbances. Prolonged exposure produces clinically significant improvement in about 80% of patients with chronic PTSD. Prolonged exposure is rooted in the theory of emotional processing, in which new, accurate information challenges previously learned fear structures and modifies them in such a way that the new, accurate information is more readily retrieved. With PTSD, it is thought that traumatic events cause inaccurate associations to develop, between stimuli and responses from the event. These inaccurate associations lead to avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, which acts as a barrier to emotional processing. Over years of testing and development, prolonged exposure has evolved into an adaptable program of intervention to address the needs of varied trauma survivors. In addition to reducing symptoms of PTSD, prolonged exposure instills confidence and a sense of mastery, improves various aspects of daily functioning, increases the ability to cope with courage when facing stress, and improves the ability to discriminate safe and unsafe situations.Eftekhari, A.; Stines, L.R. & Zoellner, L.A. (2006). Do You Need To Talk About It? Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of Chronic PTSD. The Behavior Analyst Today, 7(1), 70‚Äì83 BAO In 2001, Prolonged Exposure for PTSD received an Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Award from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Prolonged exposure was selected by SAMHSA and the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention as a Model Program for national dissemination.Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety: Treatment of PTSD at the CTSA Components PTSD is characterized by the re-experiencing of the traumatic event through intrusive and upsetting memories, nightmares, flashbacks, and strong emotional and physiological reactions triggered by reminders of the trauma. Most individuals with PTSD try to ward off the intrusive symptoms and avoid the trauma- reminders, even when those reminders are not inherently dangerous. To address the traumatic memories and triggers that are reminders of the trauma, the core components of exposure programs for the disorder are: #Imaginal exposure, revisiting the traumatic memory, repeated recounting it aloud, and processing the revisiting experience #In vivo exposure, the repeated confrontation with situations and objects that cause distress but are not inherently dangerous The goal of this treatment is to promote processing of the trauma memory and to reduce distress and avoidance evoked by the trauma reminders. Additionally, individuals with emotional numbing and depression are encouraged to engage in enjoyable activities, even if these activities do not cause fear or anxiety but have dropped out the person's life due to loss of interest.Williams, M.; Cahill, S.; Foa, E. Psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In Textbook of Anxiety Disorders, Second Edition, ed. D. Stein, E. Hollander, B. Rothbaum, American Psychiatric Publishing, 2010. The imaginal exposure typically occurs during the therapy session and consists of retelling the trauma to the therapist. For the in vivo exposure, the clinician works with the client to establish a fear and avoidance hierarchy and typically assigns exposures to these list items as homework progressively. The therapist may also record the session and ask the patient to continue to complete in vivo exercises on their own time with the help of the recording. Both components work by facilitating emotional processing so that the problematic traumatic memories and avoidances habituate (desensitize) and are better tolerated.Kazi, A.; Freund, B. & Ironson, G. (2008). Prolonged Exposure Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder following the 9/11 attack with a person who escaped from the Twin Towers. Clinical Case Studies, 7, 100‚Äì16. Randomized control trials reflect that only 10‚Äì38% of PTSD patients who take part in PE therapy terminate treatment before their program is complete (generally after at least 8 sessions). Studies Practitioners throughout the United States and many other countries currently use prolonged exposure to successfully treat survivors of varied traumas including rape, assault, child abuse, combat, motor vehicle accidents, and disasters. Prolonged exposure has been beneficial for those suffering from co-occurring PTSD and substance abuse when combined with substance abuse treatment.Joseph, J.S. & Gray, M.J. (2008). Exposure Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention, 1(4), 69‚Äì80 BAO Studies have also reflected that prolonged exposure therapy aids patients who suffer from both PTSD and borderline personality disorder when the treatment is coupled with dialectical behavior therapy. Some were concerned that PE would negatively affect the treatment of patients with substance abuse disorder (SUD) as purposefully and intentionally exposing them to their reminders and triggers may worsen their state; however, randomized control trial studies exist which indicate that there are no negative effects of using PE for patients with SUD. Conducted studies have reflected positively on the effectiveness of PE. For example, in the Netherlands, patients responded better to PE than to eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment. 6 month follow ups revealed that PE had also lessened psychotic and schizophrenic issues. Furthermore, the symptoms of in a small group of female methadone users in Israel had decreased after PE treatment. PE therapy was also found to be superior to supportive therapy in female veterans with PTSD in a randomized controlled trial.

Rowe, Gary. 1965. The adynaton as a stylistic device. The American Journal of Philology 85.4:387-396. The adynaton form was often used for vows and covenants, such as in the 16th Epode of Horace, 25-34. Its plural form (adynata) was translated in Latin as impossibilia. A frequent usage was to refer to one highly unlikely event occurring sooner than another: Zenobius's collection of proverbial expressions includes \\"to count sand\\" to characterize something impossible or unattainable.William F. Hansen, Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature, p. 98 However it largely fell into disuse during the Middle Ages before undergoing a minor revival in the works of romantic poets, who would boast of the power of their love, and how it could never end.

The gene is a member of the TIMP gene family. The protein is thought to be a metastasis suppressor.  Function  The proteins encoded by this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix. In addition to an inhibitory role against metalloproteinases, the encoded protein has a unique role among TIMP family members in its ability to directly suppress the proliferation of endothelial cells. As a result, the encoded protein may be critical to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by suppressing the proliferation of quiescent tissues in response to angiogenic factors, and by inhibiting protease activity in tissues undergoing remodelling of the extracellular matrix. TIMP2 functions as both an MMP inhibitor and an activator. TIMPs inhibit active MMPs, but different TIMPs inhibit different MMPs better than others. For example, TIMP-1 inhibits MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-1 and MMP-3 better than TIMP-2, and TIMP-2 inhibits MMP-2 more effectively than other TIMPs. In melanocytic cells TIMP2 gene expression may be regulated by MITF. A more recent discovery is that TIMP2 plays an important role in hippocampal function and cognitive function. It plays a critical role in the benefit conferred to old mice when given human umbilical cord blood.  Interactions  TIMP2 has been shown to interact with: * MMP14 and * MMP2.

John Podesta left the firm in 1993, and Tony Podesta left the firm on October 30, 2017, following Mueller Probe findings. It has essentially ceased to exist since then. The firm reorganized in January 2007 after chairman Tony Podesta split with former business partner Dan Mattoon. Podesta Group, which represented American corporations as well as nonprofits and governments, was said in 2011 to have \\"close ties to the Democratic Party and the Obama administration\\", although its CEO, Kimberley Fritts, is identified in her Cogent Strategies bio as \\"a fixture in Republican politics\\".\\"Kimberley Fritts\\".

As of October 2017, the Podesta Group was reported to be under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for potentially violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act in the course of its work for the ECMU. The Podesta Group was one of six lobbying firms that participated in a 2012‚Äì2014 public relations campaign organized by Paul Manafort on behalf of the ECMU and Ukraine's pro- Russian Party of Regions; the campaign was reportedly designed with the stated goal of improving Ukraine's standing among Western audiences as a possible prelude to Ukrainian membership in the European Union. A Podesta Group spokesman denied any wrongdoing. On October 30, 2017, a federal grand jury unsealed the indictment of Manafort and his deputy Richard Gates. According to NBC News, the Podesta Group is mentioned in the indictment as one of the companies that lobbied on behalf of the Ukrainian government for Manafort and Gates. On that day, Tony Podesta stepped down as head of the Podesta Group.

As a consequence of being a surface, a capillary surface has no thickness in slight contrast with most real fluid interfaces. Capillary surfaces are of interest in mathematics because the problems involved are very nonlinear and have interesting properties, such as discontinuous dependence on boundary data at isolated points. In particular, static capillary surfaces with gravity absent have constant mean curvature, so that a minimal surface is a special case of static capillary surface. They are also of practical interest for fluid management in space (or other environments free of body forces), where both flow and static configuration are often dominated by capillary effects. The stress balance equation The defining equation for a capillary surface is called the stress balance equation,Surface Tension Module, by John W. M. Bush, at MIT OCW which can be derived by considering the forces and stresses acting on a small volume that is partly bounded by a capillary surface. For a fluid meeting another fluid (the \\"other\\" fluid notated with bars) at a surface S, the equation reads :(\\\\sigma_{ij} - \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}_{ij}) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} = - \\\\gamma \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} ( abla_{\\\\\\\\!S} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}) + abla_{\\\\\\\\!S} \\\\gamma \\\\qquad ; \\\\quad abla_{\\\\\\\\!S} \\\\gamma = abla \\\\gamma - \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} (\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\cdot abla \\\\gamma) where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} is the unit normal pointing toward the \\"other\\" fluid (the one whose quantities are notated with bars), \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sigma_{ij} is the stress tensor (note that on the left is a tensor-vector product), \\\\scriptstyle \\\\gamma is the surface tension associated with the interface, and \\\\scriptstyle abla_S is the surface gradient. Note that the quantity \\\\scriptstyle - abla_{\\\\\\\\!S} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} is twice the mean curvature of the surface. In fluid mechanics, this equation serves as a boundary condition for interfacial flows, typically complementing the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. It describes the discontinuity in stress that is balanced by forces at the surface. As a boundary condition, it is somewhat unusual in that it introduces a new variable: the surface S that defines the interface. It's not too surprising then that the stress balance equation normally mandates its own boundary conditions. For best use, this vector equation is normally turned into 3 scalar equations via dot product with the unit normal and two selected unit tangents: :((\\\\sigma_{ij} - \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}_{ij}) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} = -\\\\gamma abla_{\\\\\\\\!S} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} :((\\\\sigma_{ij} - \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}_{ij}) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{t}_1} = abla_{\\\\\\\\!S} \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{t}_1} :((\\\\sigma_{ij} - \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}_{ij}) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{t}_2} = abla_{\\\\\\\\!S} \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{t}_2} Note that the products lacking dots are tensor products of tensors with vectors (resulting in vectors similar to a matrix- vector product), those with dots are dot products. The first equation is called the normal stress equation, or the normal stress boundary condition. The second two equations are called tangential stress equations. =The stress tensor= The stress tensor is related to velocity and pressure. Its actual form will depend on the specific fluid being dealt with, for the common case of incompressible Newtonian flow the stress tensor is given by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_{ij} &= -\\\\begin{pmatrix} p&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&p;&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&p; \\\\end{pmatrix} + \\\\mu \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y} & 2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial z} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial y} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial z} & 2\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial z} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -p I + \\\\mu ( abla \\\\mathbf{v} + ( abla \\\\mathbf{v})^T) \\\\end{align} where p is the pressure in the fluid, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{v} is the velocity, and \\\\mu is the viscosity. Static interfaces In the absence of motion, the stress tensors yield only hydrostatic pressure so that \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sigma_{ij} = -pI, regardless of fluid type or compressibility. Considering the normal and tangential equations, :\\\\bar p - p = \\\\gamma abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} :0 = abla \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{t}} The first equation establishes that curvature forces are balanced by pressure forces. The second equation implies that a static interface cannot exist in the presence of nonzero surface tension gradient. If gravity is the only body force present, the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations simplify significantly: :0 = - abla p + \\\\rho \\\\mathbf{g} If coordinates are chosen so that gravity is nonzero only in the z direction, this equation degrades to a particularly simple form: :\\\\frac{d p}{d z} = \\\\rho g \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad p = \\\\rho g z + p_0 where p_0 is an integration constant that represents some reference pressure at z = 0. Substituting this into the normal stress equation yields what is known as the Young-Laplace equation: :\\\\bar \\\\rho g z + \\\\bar p_0 - (\\\\rho g z + p_0) = \\\\gamma abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad \\\\Delta \\\\rho g z + \\\\Delta p = \\\\gamma abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} where \\\\Delta p is the (constant) pressure difference across the interface, and \\\\Delta \\\\rho is the difference in density. Note that, since this equation defines a surface, z is the z coordinate of the capillary surface. This nonlinear partial differential equation when supplied with the right boundary conditions will define the static interface. The pressure difference above is a constant, but its value will change if the z coordinate is shifted. The linear solution to pressure implies that, unless the gravity term is absent, it is always possible to define the z coordinate so that \\\\Delta p = 0. Nondimensionalized, the Young-Laplace equation is usually studied in the form :\\\\kappa z + \\\\lambda = abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} where (if gravity is in the negative z direction) \\\\kappa is positive if the denser fluid is \\"inside\\" the interface, negative if it is \\"outside\\", and zero if there is no gravity or if there is no difference in density between the fluids. This nonlinear equation has some rich properties, especially in terms of existence of unique solutions. For example, the nonexistence of solution to some boundary value problem implies that, physically, the problem can't be static. If a solution does exist, normally it'll exist for very specific values of \\\\lambda, which is representative of the pressure jump across the interface. This is interesting because there isn't another physical equation to determine the pressure difference. In a capillary tube, for example, implementing the contact angle boundary condition will yield a unique solution for exactly one value of \\\\lambda. Solutions often aren't unique, this implies that there are multiple static interfaces possible; while they may all solve the same boundary value problem, the minimization of energy will normally favor one. Different solutions are called configurations of the interface. =Energy consideration= A deep property of capillary surfaces is the surface energy that is imparted by surface tension: :E_S = \\\\gamma_S A_S\\\\, where A is the area of the surface being considered, and the total energy is the summation of all energies. Note that every interface imparts energy. For example, if there are two different fluids (say liquid and gas) inside a solid container with gravity and other energy potentials absent, the energy of the system is :E = \\\\sum \\\\gamma_S A_S = \\\\gamma_{LG} A_{LG} + \\\\gamma_{SG} A_{SG} + \\\\gamma_{SL} A_{SL}\\\\, where the subscripts LG, SG, and SL respectively indicate the liquid‚Äìgas, solid‚Äìgas, and solid‚Äìliquid interfaces. Note that inclusion of gravity would require consideration of the volume enclosed by the capillary surface and the solid walls. Illustration of distributed forces at the contact line, with the contact line perpendicular to the image. The vertical part of \\\\gamma_{LG} is balanced by a slight deformation of the solid (not shown and inconsequential to this context). Typically the surface tension values between the solid‚Äìgas and solid‚Äìliquid interfaces are not known. This does not pose a problem; since only changes in energy are of primary interest. If the net solid area A_{SG} + A_{SL} is a constant, and the contact angle is known, it may be shown that (again, for two different fluids in a solid container) :E = \\\\gamma_{SL}(A_{SL} + A_{SG}) + \\\\gamma_{LG} A_{LG} + \\\\gamma_{LG} A_{SG} \\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\, so that :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E}{\\\\gamma_{LG}} = \\\\Delta A_{LG} + \\\\Delta A_{SG} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) = \\\\Delta A_{LG} - \\\\Delta A_{SL} \\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\, where \\\\theta is the contact angle and the capital delta indicates the change from one configuration to another. To obtain this result, it's necessary to sum (distributed) forces at the contact line (where solid, gas, and liquid meet) in a direction tangent to the solid interface and perpendicular to the contact line: : \\\\begin{align} 0 &= \\\\sum F_{\\\\mathrm{Contact \\\\ line}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\gamma_{LG} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) + \\\\gamma_{SL} - \\\\gamma_{SG} \\\\end{align} where the sum is zero because of the static state. When solutions to the Young-Laplace equation aren't unique, the most physically favorable solution is the one of minimum energy, though experiments (especially low gravity) show that metastable surfaces can be surprisingly persistent, and that the most stable configuration can become metastable through mechanical jarring without too much difficulty. On the other hand, a metastable surface can sometimes spontaneously achieve lower energy without any input (seemingly at least) given enough time. Boundary conditions Boundary conditions for stress balance describe the capillary surface at the contact line: the line where a solid meets the capillary interface; also, volume constraints can serve as boundary conditions (a suspended drop, for example, has no contact line but clearly must admit a unique solution). For static surfaces, the most common contact line boundary condition is the implementation of the contact angle, which specifies the angle that one of the fluids meets the solid wall. The contact angle condition on the surface S is normally written as: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}} = \\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\, where \\\\theta is the contact angle. This condition is imposed on the boundary (or boundaries) \\\\scriptstyle \\\\partial S of the surface. \\\\scriptstyle \\\\hat v is the unit outward normal to the solid surface, and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\hat n is a unit normal to S. Choice of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\hat n depends on which fluid the contact angle is specified for. For dynamic interfaces, the boundary condition showed above works well if the contact line velocity is low. If the velocity is high, the contact angle will change (\\"dynamic contact angle\\"), and as of 2007 the mechanics of the moving contact line (or even the validity of the contact angle as a parameter) is not known and an area of active research.

Chuyev states that despite the ending, OUN achieved its ultimate goals - 600 members of their organization had received military training and had battle experience and these men took positions as instructors and commanders in the structure of the newly formed Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Chuyev, Sergei Ukrainskyj Legion - Moskva, 2006 pp. 179-184 S. Bandera wrote: \\"The end of OUN was such: the revolutionary columns were commanded by Roman Shukhevych with a small party of officers who had not only undergone military training, but had come to a clear understanding of military tactics. The most important, they brought with them - an understanding of organization, strategies and tactics of partisan fighting, and the German method of dealing with partisan groups. This knowledge was very useful in the formation and activities of the UIA and in its future conflicts. During its short history the Nachtigall Battalion had 39 casualties and had 40 wounded soldiers.

In order to compromise Oberlander and Ukrainian nationalists, KGB collected materials are widely used in the local and national press, newsreel and the press-conference in Moscow. In addition, they have been identified and trained accordingly witnesses who spoke of the case at a press conference in Moscow on the court in Berlin. Given the positive results achieved in the special events on Oberlander, I ask you to award the badge \\"Honorary Officer of State Security\\" (name not disclosed) Declare gratitude and reward valuable gift. A Ukrainian postage stamp (2007) honouring the Ukrainian Commander of the Nachtigall Battalion - Roman Shukhevych on the 100th anniversary of his birth Accusations have placed the Battalion in Lviv in July 1941 and claimed that the unit participated in the pogrom that took place. Some members of the unit did indeed participate in the pogrom, which implicates the unit as a whole. World opinion: An international commission was set up at The Hague in the Netherlands in 1959 to carry out independent investigations. The members were four former anti-Hitler activists, Norwegian lawyer Hans Cappelen, former Danish foreign minister and president of the Danish parliament Ole Bj√∏rn Kraft, Dutch socialist Karel van Staal, Belgian law professor Flor Peeters, and Swiss jurist and member of parliament Kurt Scoch. Following its interrogation of a number of Ukrainian witnesses between November 1959 and March 1960, the commission concluded: \\"After four months of inquiries and the evaluation of 232 statements by witnesses from all circles involved, it can be established that the accusations against the Battalion Nachtigall and against the then Lieutenant and currently Federal Minister Oberl√§nder have no foundation in fact\\".Alfred M. de Zayas, The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939-1945 , University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London, 1979, pp. 214-227 The Ukrainian side states that none of the allegations have been proven by any documents, and that the Battalion's main priority was securing the radio station, newspapers and proclaiming Ukrainian independence. Canadian Investigation: Involvement of any members of the Nachtigall Battalion in the war crimes have not yet been established. The Canadian Commission on War Criminals in Canada (Desch√™nes Commission) that look into allegations of war criminals residing in Canada, has not named any of the members of the Nachtigall Battalion. Moreover, it concluded, that units collaborating with the Nazis should not be indicted as a group and that mere membership in such units was not sufficient to justify prosecution.Wasyl Veryha. Along the Roads of World War II. War Criminals in Canada? (Commission of Inquiry on War Criminals Report) The Simon Wiesenthal Center contends that between June 30 and July 3, 1941, in the days that the Battalion was in Lviv the Nachtigall soldiers together with the German army and the local Ukrainians participated in the killings of Jews in the city. The pretext for the pogrom was a rumor that the Jews were responsible for the execution of prisoners by the Soviets before the 1941 Soviet withdrawal from Lviv. The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust states that some 4,000 Jews were kidnapped and killed at that time.Gutman, Israel. \\"Nachtigall Battalion \\". Encyclopedia of the Holocaust. Macmillan Publishing Company: New York, 1990. It further states that the unit was removed from Lviv on July 7 and sent to the Eastern Front. The Polish side contends that members of the Nazi-led Nachtigall battalion also participated in the massacres of Polish professors, including the ex-Polish Prime minister Kazimierz Bartel, Tadeusz Boy-≈ªele≈Ñski and others, in Lw√≥w in 1941. See Massacre of Lviv professors. The activities of the Nachtigall Battalion continue to remain controversial. A study of the massacre in Lviv based on documents of the time was made by de Zayas in his book The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939-1945 University of Nebraska Press, Rockport, Maine, 2000 edition.

Philips Records released the album in August 1968, only seven months after their debut LP, Vincebus Eruptum. The album was recorded both outdoors and indoors‚Äîhence the title of the album. The songs include contributions from all members, along with two covers: \\"Satisfaction\\" by the Rolling Stones and \\"The Hunter\\" by Albert King. The album was re-released on CD in 1999 by Italian-based Akarma Records. It includes an additional song from the original sessions, titled \\"Fortunes\\", as a bonus track. Outsideinside reached number 90 on the Billboard 200 album chart. \\"Just a Little Bit\\" was the first single from the album; it peaked at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Background Outsideinside was produced by Abe \\"Voco\\" Kesh and partially engineered by Eddie Kramer, who had worked with the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the Rolling Stones (and later engineered releases by Led Zeppelin, Kiss, and others). Some songs were recorded outdoors as well as in the studio. The album's cover painting is by \\"Arab\\", and was designed by Gut Turk, a former Hells Angel. The album photographs were taken by famed rock photographer Jim Marshall. Outsideinside was the last record to feature the original Blue Cheer line-up; guitarist Leigh Stephens left the band after the album was released. Critical reception In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Mark Deming commented: In a review of the two-for-one reissue of the album (coupled with Vincebus Eruptum), Pitchfork's Alexander Lloyd Linhardt noted, \\"Outsideinside converts their [Blue Cheer's] stylistic enthusiasm and leathery attitude into structured song. If it doesn't sound as influential as Vincebus's cataclysmic insanity, it's because it defines 'classic' rock.\\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised the album where the band \\"pre-dispose of Purple, thwack the face of Hendrix, and generally pound psychedelia into the dirt\\" and concluded that \\"by most definitions this ain't heavy metal, but by most measures Blue Cheer stomp over Zep I and II\\".

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ETS family of transcription factors.  Function  There are 28 ETS genes in humans and 27 in mice. They bind the DNA via their winged-helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif known as the Ets domain that specifically recognizes DNA sequences that contain a GGAA/T core element. However, Ets proteins differ significantly in their preference for the sequence flanking the GGAA/T core motif. For instance, the consensus sequence for Ets1 is PuCC/a-GGAA/T-GCPy. On the other hand, many natural Ets1-responsive GGAA/T elements differ from this consensus sequence. The later suggests that several other transcription factors may facilitate Ets1 binding to unfavorable DNA sequences. ChIP-Seq studies have shown that Ets1 can bind both AGGAAG and CGGAAG motifs. Ets1 binds to DNA as a monomer. Phosphorylation of serine residues of the C-terminal domain (in the nucleotide sequence they belong to exon VII) known as autoinhibition makes Ets1 inactive. There are several ways to activate Ets1. First, Ets1 can be dephosphorylated. Second, two Ets1 can be activated If two Ets molecules homodimerize. The homodimerization occurs if DNA binding sites are present in the correct orientation and spacing. Thus, the exact layout of binding sites within an enhancer or promoter segment to either relieve or allow autoinhibition of Ets1 to occur may strongly influence whether or not Ets1 actually binds to particular site. Third, Ets1 can be activated by Erk2 and Ras at Thr38. The truncated isoform cannot be phosphorylated by the Erk2. It is localized in the cytoplasm and acts as a dominant negative isoform. Contrary, another isoform that misses exon VII is constitutively active. Many Ras responsive genes harbor combinatorial Ets/AP1 recognition motifs through which Ets1 and AP1 synergistically activate transcription when stimulated by Ras. In adult humans, Ets1 is expressed at high levels mainly in immune tissues such as thymus, spleen, and lymph node (B cells, T cells, NK cells, and NK T cells and non-lymphoid immune cells). An enforced expression of Ets1 blocks differentiation of B- and T-cells. Contrary, knocking Ets1 down is causing multiple defects in the immune system.  Knockout mice  Ets1 knockout mice have aberrant thymic differentiation, reduced peripheral T cell numbers, reduced IL-2 production, a skewing towards a memory/effector phenotype and impairments in the production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Although Ets1 knockout mice have an impaired development of Th1, Th2, and Treg cells, they have higher numbers of Th17 cells. In CD4/CD8 double positive thymocytes from Ets knockout mice, both the suppression of gene expression programs corresponding to alternative lineages and upregulation of T-cell specific genes are impaired. There are also partial defects in bone marrow B cell development with reduced cellularity and inefficient transition from pro-B to pre-B cell stages.  Clinical significance  Meta-analyses of multiple genome-wide association studies has suggested an association of SNPs in the ETS1 locus with psoriasis in European populations. This is not surprising because Ets1 is a negative regulator of Th17 cells. Ets1 overexpression in stratified squamous epithelial cells causes pro-oncogenic changes, such as suspension of terminal differentiation, high secretion of matrix metalloproteases (Mmps), epidermal growth factor ligands, and inflammatory mediators.  Interactions  Ets1 directly interacts with various transcription factors. Their interaction results in formation of multiprotein complexes. When Ets1 interacts with other transcription factors (Runx1, Pax5, TFE3, and USF1) its final effect on transcription depends on whether C-terminal domain is phosphorylated. Acetyltransferases CBP and p300 bind to the transactivation domain. AP1, STAT5 and VDR bind to C-terminal domain. Also, ETS1 has been shown to interact with TTRAP, UBE2I and Death associated protein 6. Importantly, ETS1 was shown to be able to bind both nucleosome-bound and -depleted DNA, with its suppression leading to increases in nucleosomal occupancy at sites normally bound by ETS1. Interaction with DNA repair promoters and proteins =DNA repair promoters= The messenger RNA and protein levels of DNA repair protein PARP1 are controlled, in part, by the expression level of the ETS1 transcription factor which interacts with multiple ETS1 binding sites in the promoter region of PARP1. The degree to which the ETS1 transcription factor can bind to its binding sites on the PARP1 promoter depends on the methylation status of the CpG islands in the ETS1 binding sites in the PARP1 promoter. If these CpG islands in ETS1 binding sites of the PARP1 promoter are epigenetically hypomethylated, PARP1 is expressed at an elevated level. The high constitutive levels of PARP1 in centenarians, providing more effective DNA repair, is thought to contribute to their unusual longevity. These levels of PARP1 expression are considered to be due to altered epigenetic control of transactivation of PARP1 expression. As shown by Wilson et al., increased ETS1 expression causes about 50 target genes to increase expression, including DNA repair genes MUTYH, BARD1, ERCC1 and XPA. Increased ETS1 expression causes resistance to cell killing by cisplatin, the resistance thought to be partly due to increased expression of DNA repair genes. =DNA repair protein interactions= ETS1 functions are regulated by protein ‚Äì protein interactions. In particular, ETS1 protein interacts with several DNA repair proteins. ETS1 binds with DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) [where the DNA-PK complex is made up of DNA-PKcs and DNA repair Ku (protein), and where Ku itself is a heterodimer of two polypeptides, Ku70 (XRCC6) and Ku80 (XRCC5)]. ETS1 interaction with DNA-PK phosphorylates ETS1. Such phosphorylation of ETS1 alters its target gene repertoire. The Ku80 portion of DNA-PK, acting alone, interacts with ETS1 to down-regulate at least one of its transcriptional activities. As shown by Legrand et al., ETS1 protein interacts with PARP1 protein. ETS1 activates PARP1, causing poly ADP-ribosylation of PARP1 itself and of other proteins, even in the absence of nicked DNA. PARP1 (without self- poly ADP-ribosylation), in turn, is needed for activation of the transactivating activity of ETS1 on a tested promoter. Active PARP1 subsequently causes poly ADP-ribosylation of ETS1, and this appears to promote ETS1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, preventing excessive activity of ETS1.

Gap junction beta-1 protein is a member of the gap junction connexin family of proteins that regulates and controls the transfer of communication signals across cell membranes, primarily in the liver and peripheral nervous system. Mutations of the GJB1 gene affecting the signalling of and trafficking through gap junctions, resulting in an inherited peripheral neuropathy called X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Complications include the demyelination of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, causing delayed transmission rates of nerve communication in the peripheral nervous system, due to irregularities in the normal function of the cells. This condition leads to a number of symptoms, most commonly muscle weakness and sensory problems in the outer extremities of the limbs. As a result, muscle atrophy and soft tissue injuries due to delayed nerve transmission can occur. In males, due to the hemizygousity of the X-chromosome, the symptoms and issues surrounding X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are more prevalent.  Function  Connexins are membrane-spanning proteins that assemble to form gap junction channels that facilitate the transfer of ions and small molecules between cells. For a general discussion of connexin proteins, see GJB2. In melanocytic cells GJB1 gene expression may be regulated by MITF.  Gene  The gene that encodes the human GJB1 protein is found on the X chromosome, on the long arm at position q13.1, in interval 8, from base pair 71,215,212 to base pair 71,225,215. = Mutations = Approximately four hundred type X Charcot-Marie- Tooth causing mutations have been identified within the GJB1 gene, and it is the only known gene to be associated with this disease,. The majority of these mutations only change a single amino acid within the protein chain, which result in a different protein being produced. Mutations within the GJB1 gene consist of novel, missense, double-missense, amino acid deletion, nonsense, frameshift, and in-frame deletions/insertions. These mutations most commonly result in proteins that work incorrectly, less effectively, degrade faster, are not present in adequate numbers or may not function at all.  Structure  The GJB1 gene is approximately 10kb in length, with one coding exon and three non-coding exons. GJB1 is a gap junction, beta 1 protein also identified as connexin 32, with 238 amino acids. This protein contains four transmembrane domains, which when assembled form gap junctions. Each of these gap junctions consist of two hemichannels (connexions), which in turn consist of six connexin molecules (gap junction trans-membrane proteins)., This enables communication between Schwann cell nuclei and axons through a radial diffusion pathway.  Function  GJB1 functions as a radial diffusion pathway, allowing the communication and diffusion of nutrients, ions and small molecules between cells. The GJB1 protein is found in a number of organs, including the liver, kidney, pancreas and nervous system. In normal circumstances this protein is located in the cell membrane of Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, specialised cells of the nervous system., These cells typically encapsulate nerves that are involved in the assembly and preservation of myelin, to ensure reliable and rapid transmission of nerve signals., Typically the GJB1 protein forms channels through the myelin to the internal Schwann cell or oligodendrocyte, allowing effective transportation and communication.,  Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease  Approximately four hundred mutations of the GJB1 gene have been identified in people with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX). CMTX is predominantly classified with symptoms related to muscle weakness and sensory problems, especially in the outer extremities of the limbs. CMTX is the second most common type of CMT (about 10% of all patients) and is transmitted as an x-linked dominant trait. It is categorised by the lack of male-to-male transmission of the mutated GJB1 gene and the differences in severity between heterozygous women and hemizygous men, with the later being more severely affected. Most of the mutations of the GJB1 gene switch or change a single amino acid in the gap junction (connexin-32) protein, although some may result in a protein of irregular size. Some of these mutations also cause hearing loss in patients with CMTX. Currently it is unknown how the mutations of the GJB1 gene lead to these specific features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, however it is theorised that the cause is due to the demyelination of nerve cells. As a result, transmission rates of nerve communication in the peripheral nervous system are delayed, which in turn would cause irregularities in the normal function of Schwann cells. Whilst CMTX is more commonly known to affect the peripheral nervous system some cases have been reported in which there is evidence of demyelination of the central nervous system. These abnormalities whilst not presenting any symptoms were identified through nerve impulse and imaging studies, and are believed to also be caused through mutations on the GJB1 gene. = Diagnosis/testing = Historically CMTX could only be diagnosed through symptoms or measurement of the speed of nerve impulses. With the creation of genetic testing, 90% of CMTX cases are now diagnosed using the mutations of the GJB1 (Cx32) gene. The genetic screening of families has also become common after the diagnosis of CMTX in a patient, to further identify other family members that may be suffering from the disease. This screening is also used systematically by researchers to identify new mutations within the gene. = Management = Currently CMTX is an incurable condition, instead patients are evaluated and treated for symptoms caused by the disease. Treatment is limited to rehabilitative therapy, use of assistive devices such as orthoses and in some cases surgical treatment of skeletal deformities and soft-tissue abnormalities. Surgical treatment most commonly includes osteotomies, soft- tissue surgery (including tendon transfers) and/or joint fusions. = Genetic counseling = Due to the nature of inheritance of CMTX, affected males will pass the GJB1 gene mutation to all female children and none of their male children, whilst females who are carriers will have a 50% chance of passing on the mutation to each of their offspring. With the development of genetic testing, it is possible to perform both prenatal and pre-implantation testing elected by the patient, when their type of mutation has been identified. Results from genetic testing can then be used to prevent the transmission of this disease to their offspring.

It is named after the famous crossing point on the Berlin Wall, and was created to document the so-called \\"best border security system in the world\\" (in the words of East German general Heinz Hoffmann). On display are the photos and related documents of successful escape attempts from East Germany, together with the escape apparatus: hot-air balloons, getaway cars, chairlifts, and a mini-U-Boat. The museum researches and maintains a list of deaths at the Berlin Wall. It is operated by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August (August 13th Working Group), and the director is Alexandra Hildebrandt. History The Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August is an association named after the date the Berlin Wall was constructed. It was formed with the purpose to fight against human rights violations as a result of the wall, and to create solutions through activities such as press conferences, publishing, and exhibitions. The museum project began as an exhibition by founding director and human rights activist Rainer Hildebrandt. According to Hildebrandt: \\"The first exhibition opened on the 19 October 1962 in an apartment with only two and a half rooms in famous Bernauer Stra√üe. The street was divided along its whole length; the buildings in the east had been vacated and their windows were bricked up. We suggested that tourists be thankful to those border guards who do not shoot to kill\\". On 14 June 1963, the museum opened in its permanent location on Friedrichstra√üe, known as Haus am Checkpoint Charlie. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August e. V. was formally registered with the city as a Verein (association) on 16 July 1963. The museum in its early days was known for its jumbled and chaotic exhibition style, with many objects and relics displayed without the usual organization of a conventional museum. It was also a political center, and actively involved in planning and assisting escapes. It featured a library, films, lectures, and a publishing operation. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the corresponding considerable reduction in its public grant money, under the leadership of Alexandra Hildebrandt the museum evolved into a private undertaking, which \\"reinvented the former political center as a 'place of experience.'\\" It operated, in the words of Hildebrandt, \\"according to business principles\\", soon earning seven-digit profits and becoming the most commercially successful museum in Europe. In 2002, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August gave up its charitable status and thus its remaining grants and tax breaks. It is now one of the most frequently visited museums in Berlin, with more than 850,000 visitors annually.Gedenkst√§tten und zeitgeschichtliche Museen bleiben im Aufw√§rtstrend State of Berlin, 13 November 2009. In recent years, the museum has continued to add to its exhibitions on the international struggle for human rights, bringing attention to the cases of Sergei Magnitsky and others. In 2004, Alexandra Hildebrandt installed the Freedom Memorial to the victims of the border forces, in a nearby empty lot. The memorial was removed the following year, after the lease on the land was terminated by the owner. Both the memorial and its removal were the subjects of some criticism and controversy.Checkpoint Charlie: Mauermahnmal abgerissen Harald Rohde, Der Tagesspiegel, 5 July 2005.

Through his marriage to Aloysia Weber, he was the brother-in-law of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Life His first marriage, in 1775, was to Maria Anna Elisabeth Schindler, daughter of Philipp Ernst Schindler, a miniature painter and director of painting at the Viennese porcelain factory.A-Wd, Tom. 69, fol. 258r. Maria Anna died on 14 March 1779 of pneumonia.Lange 1808, 106 He married Aloysia Weber, a successful soprano, in Vienna on 31 October 1780.

On 5 November the US announced that because of the current political situation it was suspending annual defense talks with Pakistan. The Deputy Secretary of State for the U.S. called \\"Musharraf\\" as an indispensable ally of the United States against the War on Terror. On 8 November US President George W. Bush spoke with Pervez Musharraf for twenty minutes on the telephone, in what Bush called a \\"very frank discussion.\\" Bush said that he told Musharraf that elections need to be held soon and that Musharraf must step down as head of the military. :On 16 November 2007 US special envoy John Negroponte, having met with Pervez Musharraf and Ashfaq Kayani (Vice Chief of Army Staff) praised the general for prosperity in Pakistan and his action against extremism. He also said that he has urged that the State of Emergency be lifted and opponents released prior to the election. Oceania * - Prime Minister John Howard telephoned General Musharraf and called for restraint and a return to democracy. Howard later said \\"whilst I retain considerable respect and admiration for the strong stance he has taken against terrorism, that Australia could not support in any way any extra-constitutional behaviour, that the rule of law had to prevail. And that I hoped there would be an early return to a more democratic past.\\" International organizations * - Secretary-General Don McKinnon described the situation as \\"a matter of deep concern\\" and said \\"It is a step in the wrong direction\\". On 12 November, the Commonwealth asked Pakistan to end emergency by 22 November or face suspension from the body. On 22 November, Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth for its failure to fulfill this condition. The CMAG said that even though it was earlier it was indicated that President Musharraf will step down as army chief and several detained protesters were freed in last ten days, the situation in Pakistan was still in violation of the Commonwealth's fundamental values. * - Louise Arbour, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed some concern over the situation, noting that a UN official, Asma Jahangir, was among the judicial and political officials detained. The commissioner also noted that UN prohibitions on actions such as torture and arbitrary detention remain in effect during times of national emergency, and that such actions must be related to and proportional with the emergency itself.

StreetSounds was an offshoot of producer and promoter Morgan Khan's StreetWave label. The first StreetSounds release was the first edition of the label's core compilation series, StreetSounds 1 in late 1982. This regular compilation series proclaimed itself 'one hour packs of the latest dance tracks'. They were composed of full-length versions of (mainly) black club and urban dance music. Some tracks were licensed from the US. History The Street Sounds formula for compilations was quality track selection, and reacting quickly to trends with a frenetic release rate. The run of the Street Sounds series coincided with, and helped promote, the rise of electronic dance music during the mid-1980s, at a time when style conscious young adults in the UK were looking for an alternative to rock, pop and post-punk music. Khan later extended the formula and released other compilation series including jazz-funk, house and high energy genres. Notable Street Sounds releases included the Philadelphia Story; SOLAR; Love Ballads; and Dance Decade box sets. The Artists compilations, that collected representative tracks from specific artists, and 'Anthems' series (compilations of dance music classics) were also well- regarded. The Japanese instrumental group A.B.'s album Deja Vu was released on the label, in 1983. The Street Sounds logo was changed several times over the lifespan of the label. The Street Sounds label went into liquidation in 1988, mainly as a result of large losses incurred by Street Scene, Khan's club music magazine. After its collapse, the Street Sounds label was dormant for some years. It has since been revived by Khan, and offers mainly reissues of back- catalogue material from the original Street Sounds incarnation. In April 2009, Street Sounds released a new Electro compilation through the Street Sounds website. Nu Electro Volume 1 featured twenty tracks mixed by Freddy Fresh and Diplomat, and the musical style returned to the electronic roots of the series rather than the hip hop style compilation that was released in 1988 as Electro 22. In 2015, Street Sounds released volume 4 of the Crucial Electro series on CD and vinyl formats. Creative Director John Carver was responsible for StreetSounds' branding. Carver suggested the name StreetSounds as an alternative to StreetBeat. He handled the branding, packaging and advertising for StreetSounds for the first few years and was responsible for devising iconic terms like \\"Electro is aural sex\\" for the Electro series and \\"Get set for sweat\\" for the Hi-NRG series.

Wallace's pro-segregation policies during his term as Governor of Alabama were rejected by most. The impact of the Wallace campaign was substantial, winning the electoral votes of several states in the Deep South. Although Wallace did not expect to win the election, his strategy was to prevent either major party candidate from winning a majority in the Electoral College. This would throw the election into the House of Representatives, where Wallace would have bargaining power sufficient to determine, or at least strongly influence, the selection of a winner. Although Nixon ultimately won a majority of 301 electoral votes (270 being a majority), Wallace's effort put the chance of a brokered electoral college relatively close. For example; had he won South Carolina or Tennessee (falling less than 50,000 votes short) and had the Democratic ticket won either Illinois or Ohio (trailing the Republican one by around 100,000 votes in both cases) Nixon would have ended up with a plurality but not a majority, and the election would - for the first time since 1824 - been thrown to the House of Representatives. Campaign development When George Wallace ran for President in 1968, it was not as a Democrat ‚Äì which he had done in the 1964 Democratic primaries and would again in the 1972 Democratic primaries ‚Äì but as a candidate of the American Independent Party. The American Independent Party was formed by Wallace, whose pro-segregation policies as governor had been rejected by the mainstream of the Democratic Party. In 1968 he ran on the idea that \\"there's not a dime's worth of difference between the two major parties\\". Wallace's strategy was essentially the same as that of Dixiecrat candidate Strom Thurmond in 1948 in that the campaign was run without any realistic chance of winning the election outright, but instead with the hope of receiving enough electoral votes to force the House of Representatives to decide the election, something many observers thought might happen. This would presumably give him the role of a power broker; Wallace hoped that southern states could use their clout to end federal efforts toward desegregation. Wallace ran a campaign supporting law and order and states' rights on racial segregation. This strongly appealed to rural white Southerners and blue-collar union workers in the North. Wallace was leading the three-way race in the Old Confederacy with 45% of the vote in mid-September. Wallace's appeal to blue- collar workers and union members (who usually voted Democratic) hurt Hubert Humphrey in Northern states like Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A mid-September AFL-CIO internal poll showed that one in three union members supported Wallace, and a Chicago Sun-Times poll showed that Wallace had a plurality of 44% of white steelworkers in Chicago. However, both Humphrey and Richard Nixon were able to peel back some Wallace support by November; the unions highlighted the flow of Northern union jobs to Wallace's Alabama, a right-to-work state (although Wallace publicly opposed right-to- work laws), and Nixon persuaded enough Southerners that a \\"divided vote\\" would give the election to Humphrey. From October 13‚Äì20, Wallace's support fell from 20% to 15% nationally. In the North, the former Wallace vote split evenly between Humphrey and Nixon. In the border South, Wallace defectors were choosing Nixon over Humphrey by three to one. Wallace's foreign policy positions set him apart from the other candidates in the field. \\"If the Vietnam War was not winnable within 90 days of his taking office, Wallace pledged an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops ... Wallace also called foreign-aid money 'poured down a rat hole' and demanded that European and Asian allies pay more for their defense.\\"Kauffman, Bill (2008-05-19) When the Left Was Right, The American Conservative These stances were overshadowed by Wallace's running mate, retired Air Force general Curtis LeMay, who implied he would use nuclear weapons to win the war. The executive director of Wallace's 1968 campaign, Tom Turnipseed, a Mobile native, was later a member of the South Carolina State Senate and an attorney in Columbia, South Carolina. Not long after the 1968 campaign, Turnipseed began moving to the political left, joined the Americans for Democratic Action, and became active in the civil rights and environmental movements. Vice presidential selection Former Georgia governor Marvin Griffin was a temporary running mate in order to get the Wallace candidacy on the ballot in several states. The Wallace campaign considered former Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, KFC founder Harland Sanders, retired Air Force General Curtis LeMay, Hollywood actor John Wayne, and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover as possible running mates. Benson and LeMay expressed interest, and Hoover did not even respond. In June, the campaign looked into several members of Congress, all of whom were unwilling to attach themselves to the Wallace ticket. Wallace's aides came to favor Happy Chandler, the former baseball commissioner and governor of Kentucky. It was hoped that Chandler could help put Wallace over the top in Tennessee, South Carolina, and Florida, where he was narrowly behind Nixon, and solidify support in Arkansas, Georgia, and North Carolina, where Wallace was leading. Wallace was cautious: Chandler had supported the hiring of Jackie Robinson by the Brooklyn Dodgers, and was now more of a mainstream liberal Democratic politician. Wallace was persuaded by early September; as one of Wallace's aides put it, \\"We have all the nuts in the country, we could get some decent people‚Äì you working one side of the street and he working the other side.\\" When the \\"done deal\\" was leaked to the press, Wallace's supporters objected; Wallace's Kentucky campaign chair resigned, and influential donor Nelson Bunker Hunt demanded that Chandler be dropped from the ticket. Wallace retracted the invitation. Hunt's first choice for the second slot was Eisenhower Cabinet member Ezra Taft Benson. Benson was barred by several Mormon leaders from joining a Wallace ticket; Benson's membership in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles would have caused an image problem for the church had he joined the Wallace ticket. Wallace ended up persuading Curtis LeMay, who feared being labeled a racist, to join the campaign. LeMay was chairman of the board of an electronics company, and the company would dismiss him if he spent his time running for vice president; Hunt set up a million- dollar fund to reimburse him for any losses.LeMay and Chandler in Curtis LeMay was an enthusiast for the use of nuclear weapons. Wallace's aides tried to persuade him to avoid questions relating to the topic, but when asked about it at his first interview, he attempted to dispel American \\"phobias about nuclear weapons\\" and discussed radioactive landcrabs at Bikini atoll. LeMay again embarrassed Wallace's campaign in the fall by suggesting that nuclear weapons could be used in the Vietnam War, which led Humphrey to dub Wallace and LeMay the \\"Bombsey Twins\\". The selection of LeMay proved a disastrous drag on the campaign and was dubbed the \\"LeMay fiasco\\" internally. The selection reinforced Wallace's gender gap: in late September, Wallace's support stood at 50% in the Old Confederacy among men, and 40% among women. In the North, Wallace had 20% support among men, but less than half that among women. Campaign rhetoric Wallace's campaign rhetoric became famous, such as when he pledged \\"If any anarchists lie down in front of my automobile, it will be the last automobile they ever lie down in front of\\" and asserted that the only four letter words that hippies did not know were w-o-r-k and s-o-a-p. He accused Humphrey and Nixon of wanting to desegregate the South. Wallace proclaimed, \\"There's not a dime's worth of difference between the Democrat and Republican parties,\\" a line that he had first used in 1966, when his first wife, Lurleen Burns Wallace, ran successfully for governor against the Republican James D. Martin. The Wallace campaign in California and other states attracted the \\"Radical Right\\", including the John Birch Society. Most mainstream media editorials expressed opposition to the Wallace campaign, but some southern newspapers enthusiastically backed him. George W. Shannon of the Shreveport Journal, for instance, wrote countless editorials supporting the third-party concept in presidential elections. Wallace repaid Shannon by appearing at Shannon's retirement dinner. In addition to Shannon, Pete Hamill of the New Left magazine Ramparts wrote that \\"Wallace and the black and radical militants ... share some common ground: local control of schools and institutions, a desire to radically change America, a violent distrust of the power structure and the establishment. In this year's election, the only one of the three major candidates who is a true radical is Wallace.\\" New Leftist Jack Newfield, who by 1971 had become critical of both his movement and \\"consensus liberals\\" like Humphrey, wrote that year: Many found Wallace an entertaining campaigner, regardless of whether they approved of his opinions. To hippies who said he was a Nazi, he replied, \\"I was killing fascists when you punks were in diapers.\\" Another memorable quote: \\"They're building a bridge over the Potomac for all the white liberals fleeing to Virginia.\\" The Wallace campaign was comfortably ahead in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Wallace's aides insisted that the campaign focus on winning the Carolinas, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee. Wallace refused, stating that he was running a \\"national campaign,\\" and traveled from Boston to San Diego in the campaign. There were rallies in 33 cities in the North during this period, but Wallace stopped only one time each in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia. On October 24, 1968, Wallace spoke at Madison Square Garden before \\"the largest political rally held in New York City since Franklin Roosevelt had denounced the forces of 'organized money' from the same stage in 1936\\". An overflow crowd of 20,000 packed the Garden while pro- and anti-Wallace protesters clashed with more than 1,000 police across the street. In a now-famous reference to a protester who had lain down in front of Lyndon B. Johnson's limousine the year before, Wallace stated, \\"I tell you when November comes, the first time they lie down in front of my limousine it'll be the last one they ever lay down in front of; their day is over! When asked what he considered the \\"biggest domestic issue for 1968,\\" Wallace replied: On the campaign trail, Wallace often repeated this theme, saying: General election results Red states went to Nixon, blue to Humphrey, orange to Wallace. Wallace's \\"outsider\\" status was once again popular with voters, particularly in the rural South. He won 9,901,118 popular votes (out of a total of 73,199,998)‚Äîthat is, 13.53% of votes cast nationally‚Äîcarried five Southern states - Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi - won 45 electoral votes plus one vote from a faithless elector, and came fairly close to receiving enough votes to throw the election to the House of Representatives. He was the first such person since Harry F. Byrd, an independent segregationist candidate in the 1960 presidential election. (John Hospers in 1972, Ronald Reagan in 1976, Lloyd Bentsen in 1988, John Edwards in 2004 and many non-candidates in 2016 all received one electoral vote from dissenters, but none earned those votes via the popular vote, and none except Hospers were actively running for President in the general election for those respective years.) Wallace also received the vote of one North Carolina elector who was pledged to Nixon. Wallace's percentage vote of 13.53% is considerably less than the 19% won by Ross Perot in 1992 who unlike Wallace did not win any electoral votes. Wallace was the most popular 1968 presidential candidate among young men. Wallace also proved to be popular among blue-collar workers in the North and Midwest, and he took many votes which might have otherwise gone to Humphrey. Wallace's support in the North plummeted from 13% in early October to 8% by election day. Nixon won the Carolinas and Tennessee with less than 40% of the vote, with Wallace close behind. These were worth 32 electoral votes (though Wallace had received 1 electoral vote from North Carolina). Had Wallace won these states, Nixon would have won the election with 270 votes, the bare minimum. However, it is highly likely that a stronger Wallace performance would have handed Missouri, the closest state (a margin of 0.57%) and a border state, to Humphrey, which would have thrown the election to the House (which as explained earlier, was Wallace's intention all along). A change of around 1% in either Ohio or New Jersey would have also thrown the election to the House, had Wallace carried North Carolina or Tennessee. A Wallace win in either one of the Carolinas or Tennessee and a 1.14% shift in Ohio would be the simplest way for the election to be thrown to the House. 1968 U.S. House election Republicans controlled the congressional delegations of the red states, Democrats controlled those of the states in blue Under the United States Constitution, the House of Representatives elects the President in the event no candidate receives a majority in the Electoral College. Each state's House delegation receives one vote. The map on the right indicates the majority party of each state's delegation following the 1968 U.S. House election - blue states being Democratic and red states being Republican. This House would have elected the President had Wallace succeeded in denying his opponents an Electoral College majority. As indicated on the map, Democrats controlled 26 of the 50 state house delegations, with Republicans controlling 19 delegations and the other five being evenly split. Had the Democratic delegations all been firmly behind Humphrey, then Wallace might have found himself with little influence on post-election events even if he had succeeded in forcing the election into the House. However, Wallace believed the Southern Democratic delegations would not support Humphrey without first obtaining substantial concessions with respect to federal desegregation measures, or might even have agreed to back Nixon if he agreed to Southern demands. An alternative theory holds that had Wallace achieved his aim he could have pre-empted an election in the House by instructing his own electors to back one of the major party candidates - there was no legal or constitutional impediment that would have prevented him from doing so. This would have allowed Wallace the opportunity to negotiate directly with the major candidates (provided he could have concluded such negotiations prior to the Electoral College formally casting its votes for President). It has been postulated that Wallace might possibly have been able to come to an agreement with Nixon who (with his party controlling only 19 state delegations) might have been seen to have little prospect of being elected President without making some sort of arrangement with Wallace.

Early life and career Mead, the son of Peter Bradford Mead and Mary Elisabeth Hansen Mead, was born and reared in Jackson, Wyoming. Mead graduated in 1984 with a bachelor's degree in radio/television from Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas where he was a member of the Bengal Lancer fraternity among other pursuits. He earned a J.D. degree from the University of Wyoming College of Law at Laramie. After law school, he served as a county and federal prosecutor and also practiced in a private law firm. U.S. Attorney In 2001, Mead was appointed United States Attorney for the District of Wyoming by President George W. Bush. He served until June 2007, when he resigned to seek the Senate seat vacated by the death of fellow Republican Craig L. Thomas. His resignation was required under the Hatch Act of 1939. In accordance with Wyoming state law,As permitted by the Seventeenth Amendment, Wyoming allows the Governor to select the replacement for a vacant Senate seat to hold the seat for the remainder of the unexpired term. However, also as permitted by the Seventeenth Amendment, Wyoming law requires that the replacement must be of the same political party as the predecessor. the Republican party selected the three candidates from which Democratic Governor Dave Freudenthal could make his selection. On the third ballot, The Republican State Central Committee, by fourteen votes, eliminated Mead from consideration. Freudenthal chose state Senator John Barrasso; the others he considered were former State Treasurer Cynthia Lummis of Cheyenne and former Republican State Chairman and lobbyist Tom Sansonetti, who had been an aide to Thomas. Governor =2010 election= Mead visiting Guantanamo Bay In 2010, Mead won the Republican gubernatorial primary with 30,272 votes, defeating State Auditor Rita Meyer, who polled 29,558 votes, despite Meyer's endorsement by former Alaska governor Sarah Palin. Fort Bridger rancher Ron Micheli finished third, with 27,592 votes; State House Speaker Colin M. Simpson finished fourth with 16,673 votes. With Freudenthal not running for a third term, because of term limits, Mead was a heavy favorite in the general election; Wyoming is heavily Republican. Mead's campaign emphasized his support for gun rights. He opposed gay marriage and abortion, but stated that there should be exceptions to allow an abortion when the woman's health or life is at stake and in cases of rape and incest. On November 2, 2010, Mead easily defeated Leslie Petersen, the former chairwoman of the Wyoming Democratic Party, receiving 72% of the vote to Petersen's 25%. =2014 election= In late January 2013, Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction Cindy Hill, a Republican, announced that she would be a candidate in Wyoming's 2014 governor's race. A Tea Party favorite, Hill would face Mead in the Republican primary on August 19, 2014. Earlier in January, Mead had signed legislation sharply reducing the responsibilities of Hill's office, making the position largely ceremonial. Mead named Rich Crandall, a moderate Republican member of the Arizona State Senate and a political ally of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, to fill the newly established position of \\"director\\" of the Wyoming Education Department, a position that had most of the powers formerly held by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. In January 2014, the Wyoming Supreme Court rebuffed Mead and declared that the legislature had overstepped its constitutional powers when it stripped Hill of most of her office duties. Mead unsuccessfully appealed the decision, and Hill resumed her duties in May 2014, just a few weeks before the beginning of the gubernatorial primary campaign. Meanwhile, two Republican lawmakers who said they had no ties to Hill called for a special prosecutor to investigate Mead's conduct in the matter. Representatives Gerald Gay of Casper and Stephen Watt of Rock Springs said that Mead abused the powers of his office and used funds prior to legal authorization to discredit Hill. Gay said: \\"I am in possession of information and internal email correspondence that gives rise to the concern that the governor has used state monies to manufacture allegations against a political opponent. ... The public knows an abuse of power when they see it, and this (is) one of the most egregious examples of abuse of power in Wyoming history. ... I believe there were political motivations because of the timeline that was involved. ... The things I have found are egregious enough that they have to be stopped immediately and to make sure they never happen again.\\" Gay claimed that a special prosecutor was needed because he did not trust Wyoming Attorney General Peter K. Michael, a Mead appointee, to conduct a fair probe. Michael said that his office does not prosecute crimes except in rare situations, and would not in this particular matter. Mead handily won re- nomination in the 2014 Republican primary, with 53,626 votes (55 percent), compared to Dr. Taylor Haynes' 31,490 (32 percent), and Hill's 12,443 (13 percent). In the November 4 general election, Mead handily defeated Pete Gosar, the former Democratic Party state chairman and the brother of a Republican U.S. representative from Arizona, Paul Gosar. In the same election, Republican Jillian Balow, backed by Mead, won election to succeed Hill as the education superintendent. =Administration= On October 26, 2012, Mead named Buffalo, Wyoming, businessman and rancher Mark Gordon as the state treasurer, to succeed Joseph B. Meyer, who died in office. On February 17, 2015, Mead vetoed legislation intended to prevent the state from permanently confiscating an individual‚Äôs property through civil forfeiture until after a felony conviction had been attained. The legislation, Senate File 14, gained strong popular support and passed through the Wyoming Legislature, with majorities in excess of 2/3 in both houses. An attempt to override the veto failed. Personal Mead has an older brother, Bradford Scott \\"Brad\\" Mead, a Jackson attorney, and an older sister, Muffy Mead-Ferro of Salt Lake City, the author of Confessions of a Slacker Mom. Mead's mother, Mary, was the GOP gubernatorial nominee in 1990. Considered an expert horsewoman, she died in 1996, on her 61st birthday, in a horseback accident while working cattle in Grand Teton National Park. In 2003, Mead and his brother and sister put their family ranch in the park up for sale; the price was said to be $110 million. Mead's paternal aunt, Andrea Mead Lawrence, was an alpine ski racer who competed in three Winter Olympic Games and won two gold medals for the United States. Mead and his wife Carol have two children.

Structure  The N-terminus of ezrin contains a FERM domain which is further subdivided into three subdomains. The C-terminus contain an ERM domain.  Function  The cytoplasmic peripheral protein encoded by this gene can be phosphorylated by protein-tyrosine kinase in microvilli and is a member of the ERM protein family. This protein serves as a linker between plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton. It plays a key role in cell surface structure adhesion, migration, and organization. The N-terminal domain (also called FERM domain) binds sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) protein (involving long-range allostery). This binding can happen only when ezrin is in its active state. The activation of ezrin occurs in synergism of the two factors: 1) binding of the N-terminal domain to phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bis-phosphate (PIP2) and 2) phosphorylation of threonine T567 in the C-terminal domain. Binding to actin filaments (via C-terminal) and to membrane proteins (via N-terminal) stabilizes the protein's conformation in its active mode.

Scope  Celebrate Recovery is a recovery program aimed at all \\"hurts, habits, and hang-ups\\", including but not exclusive to: high anxiety; co-dependency; compulsive behaviors; sex addiction; financial dysfunction; drug and alcohol addictions; and eating disorders. Celebrate Recovery is one of the seven largest addiction recovery support group programs. Promotional materials assert that over 5 million people have participated in a Celebrate Recovery step studyhttps://www.celebraterecovery.com/about/history-of-crCf. https://store.pastors.com/products/celebrate-recovery-updated-curriculum-kit . Note that this source doesn't specify participation beyond \\"discovered\\". in over 35,000 churcheshttp://www.celebraterecovery.com/ Approximately two-thirds of these participants are in recovery for something other than drugs or alcohol. Leaders seek to normalize substance abuse as similar to other personal problems common to all people.  Methods  Celebrate Recovery uses both the 12 steps developed by Alcoholics Anonymous and a very similar set of eight sequential principles that are understood as a lesson of Jesus' Beatitudes. In addition to issue non-specific large group gatherings and individual mentoring, Celebrate Recovery encourages participants to form a small group of \\"Accountability Partners\\" who all have the same problem and support one another closely. Celebrate Recovery groups are held under the management of local church organizations. A study of Celebrate Recovery participants found that levels of spirituality were associated with greater confidence to resist substance use. Celebrate Recovery has not been significantly studied, so there is no empirical evidence regarding the impacts or efficacy of the Celebrate Recovery program.  History  Driveway to Saddleback Church, Rancho Capistrano John Baker was an alcoholic and staff member of Saddleback Church who began healing through Alcoholics Anonymous. He wanted a specifically Christian addiction recovery group, so with the support of Rick Warren, Celebrate Recovery began as a ministry of Saddleback Church under Baker's leadership in 1991. John Baker continues to be the primary author of The Celebrate Recovery curriculum and materials.  Program fidelity constraints  The name Celebrate Recovery is a registered trademark of John Baker,U.S. trademark record for \\"Celebrate Recovery\\" and the national Celebrate Recovery organization requires that groups using this name hold closely to a standardized format. They may not use resources outside of the Bible and authorized Celebrate Recovery curriculum materials. Group facilitators must be trained and agree to a list of expectations, including standardized guidelines at each meeting.

Earle Vaughan, (February 3, 1912 - March 9, 1978) was an American telephony engineer, responsible for system and software design for Bell Laboratories' Electronic Switching System No. 1 ESS, and for planning and development of No. 4 Electronic Switching System for long distance telephony. Biography In 1928 Vaughan began work in Bell Laboratories, then attended Cooper Union College in New York City, where in 1933 he received a Bachelor of Science degree. Throughout the next decade he worked on a variety of transmission and signaling projects, and in 1944 received the Naval Ordnance Award for his computer work. In 1945 he began research on two experimental switching systems: first the Electronically Controlled Automatic Switching System (ECASS), an experimental system using cold cathode gas tubes, reed switches and a special telephone set, and subsequently the Drum Information Assembler and Dispatcher (DIAD), a magnetic drum system that used vacuum tubes and semiconductor diodes. DIAD was the first switch with memory. In 1952 Vaughan became a supervisor in Bell Labs' Switching Research Department, leading studies on transistor, ferroelectric, and magnetic core memories in logic systems. In 1955 he was named Head of the Switching Research Department and began work on the Experimental Solid State Exchange (ESSEX), a pioneering solid-state system using pulse-code modulation and a central time-division switch. In 1958 Vaughan became Director of the Systems Research Center, and in 1962 moved to the Switching Systems Development Area. In 1968, Vaughan assumed overall responsibility for planning and developing No. 4 ESS. He died on March 9, 1978 in Pinehurst, North Carolina.

NFFE has about 200 local unions, most of them agency-wide bargaining units. Its members work primarily in the Department of Defense, the Forest Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the General Services Administration, the National Park Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Passport Services division of the Bureau of Consular Affairs (Department of State). Formation Workers in federal agencies had formed craft-based unions on the local level beginning in the early 1880s. Unions representing letter carriers and railway postal clerks won passage in 1888 of federal legislation mandating an eight-hour day for postal workers. In 1898, these two unions‚Äîwith the support of the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor‚Äîpushed for legislation revising federal postal salaries as well. Although the effort was unsuccessful, a union of postal clerks organized in 1900.Mayers, The Federal Service..., 1922. The growing power of these and other unions in the federal government led President Theodore Roosevelt to issue Executive order 163 on January 31, 1902, banning federal workers from \\"individually or through associations, [soliciting] an increase of pay, or to influence or to attempt to influence in their own interest any legislation whatever, either before Congress or its Committees, or in any way save through the heads of the Departments in or under which they serve, on penalty of dismissal from the government service.\\"Executive Order 163, January 31, 1902, The American Presidency Project. This Executive Order was expanded by Roosevelt on January 26, 1906, to include the independent agencies as well. On November 26, 1908, Roosevelt dramatically widened the extent of the Executive Order to include military personnel, expanded the kind of information which could not be communicated, and banned other actions by employees. Under Congressional pressure, President William H. Taft made the Executive Order less onerous. On April 8, 1912, Taft amended the order to permit federal workers to communicate with Congress, but required them to do so through their supervisors and department heads. Unhappy with Taft's refusal to rescind the order entirely, Congress passed the Lloyd- La Follette Act (¬ß6, , ) on August 24, 1912, declaring that \\"the right of persons employed in the civil service of the United States, either individually or collectively, to petition Congress or any member thereof or to furnish information to either House of Congress or to any committee thereof, shall not be denied or interfered with.\\" The Lloyd-La Follette Act provided a significant impetus to the formation federal employees' unions. In 1916, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) acted to bring the various local unions together to form a single national union. The National Federation of Federal Employees was founded in Washington, D.C., on September 17, 1917. In 1918, it became the first labor union to win the legal right to represent federal workers. History Dennis G. Bue (seated, right), president of Local 1363 of the National Federation of Federal Employees, signing a labor-management agreement with Lt. Gen. Daniel R. Zanini (seated, left), Commander, 8th Army, in South Korea on October 31, 2002. NFFE grew quickly. For example, by 1929 it had organized more than 1,500 workers at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The unit was the largest NFFE chapter in the country, the largest local union in the country, and the largest women's union in the country.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 9: The T.U.E.L. to the End of the Gompers Era, 1991. NFFE also quickly abandoned its craft focus. Some local chapters‚Äîespecially those in large federal agencies in Washington, D.C., where the number of workers enabled craft-based bargaining units to remain viable‚Äîretained their craft structure. But most of the union's units throughout the country became industrial unions. Even many of the D.C.-area unions abandoned their craft orientation to become industrial unions with agency-wide bargaining units.Johnson and Libecap, The Federal Civil Service System and the Problem of Bureaucracy: The Economics and Politics of Institutional Change, 1994. The significance of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing local was not lost on NFFE. NFFE became a strong advocate for women's rights, and elected a woman, Florence Etheridge, as the chair of its first national council. NFFE relied heavily on the provisions of the Lloyd-La Follette Act as the basis for its operations. Much of the union's focus was on legislative action. For example, it began advocating for a formal federal job classification system and uniform rates of compensation in 1919. These efforts paid off: The same year, Congress established the Joint Congressional Committee on the Reclassification of Salaries. In 1923, NFFE won passage of the Classification Act, which established uniform, nationwide compensation levels and tied them to the duties and responsibilities of job positions. In 1931, NFFE disaffiliated from the American Federation of Labor. The break occurred over the AFL's refusal to abandon its support for craft unionism and cease its attacks on industrial unions. NFFE disaffiliated in December 1931. The AFL responded by chartering a new federal employees union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), on October 17, 1932. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10988, establishing the right of federal workers to engage in collective bargaining. Consequently, union membership among U.S. government employees soared from 13 percent in 1961 to 60 percent in the 1974. NFFE's membership also grew tremendously, roughly doubling during the same period from 80,000 members to 150,000 members.Levitan and Gallo, \\"Can Employee Associations Negotiate New Growth?\\", Monthly Labor Review, July 1989. In 1963, NFFE was one of the foremost proponents of the Equal Pay Act. NFFE became embroiled in a major legal fight with the Reagan administration. In August 1987, the Reagan administration issued civil service rules requiring all federal workers to sign a new secrecy pledge, Standard Form 189. Administration officials said the new form was designed merely to reinforce the need to maintain the security of those documents classified as top secret. But NFFE filed a lawsuit on August 17, 1987, challenging the constitutionality of the secrecy pledge.\\"Labor Suit Widens Drive on Secrecy Pledge,\\" Associated Press, September 3, 1987. In May 1988, a U.S. District Court ruled in National Federation of Federal Employees v. United States (688 F. Supp. 671) that Standard Form 189 was constitutional. The NFFE and other plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In July 1988, the District Court further held in National Federation of Federal Employees v. United States (695 F. Supp. 1196) that certain terms in Standard Form 189 needed additional clarification by the executive branch. NFFE appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Information Security Oversight Office, 1990 Report to the President, 1990. Meanwhile, in September 1988, the federal government issued Standard Form 312 as a replacement for Standard Form 189. The new form expunged much of the objectionable language which had so deeply concerned NFFE and other unions. On April 18, 1989, the Supreme Court held in American Foreign Service Association v. Garfinkel, 490 U.S. 153, that the issuance of Standard Form 312 may have resolved the conflict. The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the District Court to resolve any outstanding issues. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit also remanded the second NFFE lawsuit to District Court. In March 1990, the District Court dismissed the remaining issues in its ruling in American Foreign Service Association v. Garfinkel, 732 F. Supp. 13), and NFFE dropped any further attempts to revive the suit. =Membership losses and affiliation= By 1989, NFFE‚Äîonce the second-largest union representing federal workers‚Äîhad shed nearly three-quarters of its members. The American Federation of Government Employees now had 180,000 dues-paying members, the International Association of Machinists 100,000 dues-paying members, the National Treasury Employees Union 65,000 dues-paying members, and the National Association of Government Employees (a division of the Service Employees International Union) 50,000 dues-paying members. The National Federation of Federal Employees, however, had just 45,000 dues-paying members.Levitan and Gallo, \\"Can Employee Associations Negotiate New Growth?\\", Monthly Labor Review, July 1989.The focus on dues-paying members is important under U.S. federal law. The closed shop and union shop are banned under labor relations laws and regulations governing federal workers. A union which represents a unit of workers must represent all the workers, whether they pay dues or not. Most federal workers' unions have substantial numbers of non-dues-paying members who nonetheless must receive services from the union. For comparison, in 1989, the American Federation of Government Employees had 180,000 dues- paying members but was forced to represent 700,000 employees. NFFE had 45,000 and 152,000 members, respectively; the National Treasury Employees Union 65,000 and 146,000. Such large numbers of non-dues-paying members can significantly drain a union's resources. See: Levitan and Gallo, \\"Can Employee Associations Negotiate New Growth?\\", Monthly Labor Review, July 1989. Much of NFFE's membership losses had come through significant downsizing of the blue- collar federal workforce where NFFE's membership was concentrated. NFFE also lost a large number of members due to raiding. The American Federation of Government Employees was particularly aggressive in courting NFFE members and convincing them to switch their union affiliation.Masters, \\"Federal-Sector Unions: Current Status and Future Directions,\\" Journal Journal of Labor Research, March 2004. Such raids eventually drove NFFE to re-affiliate with the AFL-CIO. In 1998, AFGE began an organizing drive among 2,600 physicians, nurses and dentists working for the Veterans Health Administration in the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs.Pueschel, \\"Unionization Continues to Grow in Agencies,\\" U.S. Medicine, March 2006. The workers were already represented by NFFE, and constituted more than 85 percent of NFFE's membership in the VA health system. As NFFE's voting strength among the workers weakened, the national union's leaders sought to end the raid by affiliating with the AFL- CIO.The AFL-CIO constitution forbids its members from raiding one another. The AFL-CIO declined to issue a charter, but agreed to readmit the union if it affiliated with an existing AFL-CIO member. The NFFE executive council subsequently agreed to affiliate the union with the International Association of Machinists (IAM).The affiliation was later ratified by delegates to the NFFE biennial convention in 1990. The IAM claimed to represent more than 100,000 federal workers, making it the second-largest union of federal workers. The affiliation did not help, however. Because the organizing dispute began prior to NFFE's affiliation with IAM, the AFL-CIO ruled that the election could go ahead. Although IAM devoted significant resources to the organizing battle, the Machinists' expertise was in the construction and aerospace fields, not health care. After a year-long campaign, AFGE convinced a majority of the VA employees to switch their affiliation in 2000.Ballard, \\"AFGE Wins Election to Represent Veterans Affairs Workers,\\" Government Executive, March 14, 2001; Rutzick, \\"Union Rally,\\" Government Executive, February 1, 2007. Recent issues The IAM affiliation, however, helped to significantly strength NFFE in the longer term. New raids on NFFE membership no longer occurred, and the union's administrative and financial resources greatly improved. NFFE is now considered \\"a key player in backing collective bargaining and appeal rights of [federal] employees.\\" As of 2007, NFFE represented about 100,000 federal workers. More recently, NFFE waged a lengthy legal battle against the U.S. Department of Defense's new National Security Personnel System. NFFE won several significant rulings in the legal fight but did not prevent the system's implementation, and the union began to pursue legislative remedies in Congress instead. The union also opposed the Iraq Study Group's recommendation that the Bush administration force government civilians to serve in Iraq.Friedman, \\"Unions Oppose 'Draft' of Federal Workers to Iraq,\\" Federal Times, December 8, 2006. Death of Richard Brown NFFE President Richard N. Brown died unexpectedly at his home in Arlington, Virginia, at the age of 47 on June 30, 2009.

NMS was founded in 1985, after developing sophisticated matching algorithms and software for the placement of physicians into residencies in the US. Since then, NMS has implemented Matching Programs in a number of industries and professions, including osteopathic medicine, psychology, dentistry, pharmacy, and optometry.NMS Web Site NMS is headquartered in Toronto. Matching Programs place applicants into positions based on lists of preferred choices submitted by applicants and recruiters. A Matching Program eliminates premature decisions based on incomplete information by allowing all offers, acceptances or rejections to occur at the same time. Therefore many common adverse situations are eliminated from the recruitment process, such as applicants hoarding multiple offers, applicants reneging on a prior acceptance in order to accept a more preferred subsequent offer, and recruiters overfilling the number of positions available. Applicants and recruiters benefit from having full choice of all potential placements. The best strategy for both applicants and recruiters is to submit preference lists that reflect their true preferences.

'Precinct A' laid out and developed by the New Town Commission in 1967‚Äì68 and from the beginning a mixture of private and rented housing specifically intended to accommodate families of migrating management and professionals that a developing New Town required. This first development is situated at the Redbourn Road end of St. Agnells Lane, and takes in the self- build scheme already in progress at Wooton Drive in 1967/8, Crawley Drive to the Hammond Nursery, Infant and Junior School facing west on to Cambrian Way, and extending along the east side of Aycliffe Drive, and taking in the south side of Washington Avenue. The second development, the large social housing estate at Grovehill West, began in 1972 and starts from the north side of Washington Avenue taking in: that part of St Agnells Lane north of Washington Avenue as far as Cupid Green Lane and continuing on to regain the upper end of the north side of Washington Avenue that meets Aycliffe Drive; the major sprawl of the development is west of Aycliffe Drive taking in Piccotts End Lane and beyond. Henry Wells Square containing the local shops features a Tesco Express, post office, chemist, a pub and a fish and chip shop. Grovehill is served by: Grovehill Community Centre (home to an internet cafe) and Grovehill Playing Fields, home to many football pitches, two baseball diamonds (home to Herts baseball club) and changing facilities and from 2011, an area of scrub land was converted into allotments. There are also various churches, a medical and a dental surgery as well as several schools including the original Grovehill School built by the New Town Commission (and renamed The Astley Cooper School at a later date). Grovehill was part of the second wave of New Town development with building commencing in 1967. The large housing estate at Grovehill West started construction early in 1972 but took some years to complete due to the insolvency of the main contractors and was finally completed in the early 1980s.

With 25 drummers and color guard section, the corps became famous for its demanding six-minute routine performed at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in 2003. With its invitation to Edinburgh, Top Secret became one of the first non-military, non-British Commonwealth acts to perform on the Esplanade at Edinburgh Castle. Since its success in 2003, Top Secret was invited to return to Edinburgh in 2006 with a new routine. They were invited a third time in 2009 and again in 2012, 2015, and 2018. Under the leadership of Erik Julliard, the band is also responsible for the founding of the Basel Tattoo, a military tattoo show similar to the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, now held annually in Basel.  Drumming style  Top Secret Drum Corps performing with their 'fire-sticks' Top Secret has its roots in the rich drumming traditions of the band's home city, Basel, which is known for its annual carnival called Basler Fasnacht. The city is said to have over 3,000 active drummers at any one time. These drummers perform at traditional events such as Fasnacht, the Vogel Gryff, Charivari, and various parades associated with the city's guilds. A Trommelk√∂nig (Drummer King) competition is also held every year by the city's Fasnacht Committee. Basel drumming style is militaristic, derived from the military drumming drills of Swiss soldiers dating back to the Middle Ages. Top Secret in many ways adheres to the military nature of Basel drumming, but differs in many respects. Its drummers play at a much faster rate. Also, while traditional Basel drumming is somber and favors traditional marching tunes (accompanied by fifes during the Fasnacht), Top Secret's drumming style is upbeat and playful. Segments of their routines feature a rhumba, a drummer's duel, drumstick juggling, exploding flagpoles, and other crowd-pleasing details. Perhaps because of their 18th century uniforms and precision work, the band is often referred to as a military band or a part of the Swiss Army, but it is not affiliated with any military unit.  Members  Top Secret's members include highly dedicated drummers with diverse day jobs: bankers, civil servants, factory workers, college students, and others. They give up their leisure time to practice nearly every day of the year. Due to the demanding nature of the work, its membership changes frequently.  Ongoing success  Since its 2003 performance at Edinburgh, Top Secret has enjoyed worldwide success. They have performed at various venues in Europe, the United States, Australia and at the 2008 South African Tattoo held from 11 to 14 September 2008.City of Johannesburg Website , Tattoo gives drumming an edge, 27 August 2008 In 2011 they performed at the Quebec City Military Tattoo. They are the subject of a documentary film by Swiss television which recounts their rise to fame at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. A feature film based on the Edinburgh endeavour is currently in the works with Insert Films, Switzerland. Top Secret made an appearance on an episode of the 2014 series of Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, as the act for the \\"End of the Show\\" show. In their routine, show presenters Ant and Dec joined in as drummers, colour-inverted versions of the drummers' jackets (Ant and Dec wore white; the drummers always wear off- black). The routine included the ever-present drummers' duel, the stick juggle, and the fire-stick routine. A Top Secret Drum Corps drumming loop features heavily on British electronic music band The Prodigy's 2015 release The Day Is My Enemy, which also became the title of the album released the same year. The Prodigy's founder and producer Liam Howlett is said to be a big fan of the Top Secret Drum Corps and asked permission to record a drum section for use on the band's album.

The protein encoded by this gene is the gamma component of fibrinogen, a blood-borne glycoprotein composed of three pairs of nonidentical polypeptide chains. Following vascular injury, fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin which is the most abundant component of blood clots. In addition, various cleavage products of fibrinogen and fibrin regulate cell adhesion and spreading, display vasoconstrictor and chemotactic activities, and are mitogens for several cell types. Mutations in this gene lead to several disorders, including dysfibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia and thrombophilia. Alternative splicing of the mRNA chain results in two transcript variants; the common Œ≥A chain and the alternatively spliced Œ≥' chain. Approximately 10% of the total plasma fibrinogen consists of Œ≥A/Œ≥' fibrinogen, with <1% consisting of Œ≥'/Œ≥' fibrinogen.

It belongs to the histone deacetylase class of enzymes responsible for the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues at the N-terminal region of the core histones (H2A,H2B,H3, and H4). As such, it plays an important role in gene expression by facilitating the formation of transcription repressor complexes and for this reason is often considered an important target for cancer therapy. Though the functional role of the class to which HDAC2 belongs has been carefully studied, the mechanism by which HDAC2 interacts with histone deacetylases of other classes has yet to be elucidated. HDAC2 is broadly regulated by protein kinase 2 (CK2) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), but biochemical analysis suggests its regulation is more complex (evinced by the coexistence of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in three distinct protein complexes). Essentially, the mechanism by which HDAC2 is regulated is still unclear by virtue of its various interactions, though a mechanism involving p300/CBP- associated factor and HDAC5 has been proposed in the context of cardiac reprogramming. Generally, HDAC2 is considered a putative target for the treatment for a variety of diseases, due to its involvement in cell cycle progression. Specifically, HDAC2 has been shown to play a role in cardiac hypertrophy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), osteosarcoma, and stomach cancer.  Structure and Mechanism  This image shows the structure of the HDAC2 enzyme. The two consecutive benzene rings form the foot pocket, where as the single benzene rings forms the lipophilic tube. HDAC2 belongs to the first class of histone deactylases. The active site of HDAC2 contains a Zn2+ ion coordinated to the carbonyl group of a lysine substrate and a water molecule. The metallic ion facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl group by a coordinated water molecule, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate is momentarily stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions and metal coordination, until it ultimately collapses resulting in the deacetylation of the lysine residue. The HDAC2 active site consists of a lipophilic tube which leads from the surface to the catalytic center, and a 'foot pocket' containing mostly water molecules. The active site is connected to Gly154, Phe155, His183, Phe210, and Leu276. The footpocket is connected to Tyr29, Met35, Phe114, and Leu144.  Function  This gene product belongs to the histone deacetylase family. Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes and are responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal region of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). This protein also forms transcriptional repressor complexes by associating with many different proteins, including YY1, a mammalian zinc-finger transcription factor. Thus, it plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events.  Disease Relevance  = Cardiac Hypertrophy = HDAC2 has been shown to play a role in the regulatory pathway of cardiac hypertrophy. Deficiencies in HDAC2 were shown to mitigate cardiac hypertrophy in hearts exposed to hypertrophic stimuli. However, in HDAC2 transgenic mice with inactivated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (Gsk3beta), hypertrophy was observed at a higher frequency. In mice with activated Gsk3beta enzymes and HDAC2 deficiencies, sensitivity to hypertrophic stimulus was observed at a higher rate. The results suggest regulatory roles of HDAC2 and GSk3beta.The HDAC2 enzyme attacking a lysine residue.Mechanisms by which HDAC2 responds to hypertrophic stress have been proposed, though no general consensus has been met. One suggested mechanism puts forth casein kinase dependent phosphorylation of HDAC2, while a more recent mechanism suggests acetylation regulated by p300/CBP-associated factor and HDAC5. = Alzheimer's Disease = It has been found that patients with Alzheimer's disease experience a decrease in the expression of neuronal genes. Furthermore, a recent study found that inhibition of HDAC2 via c-Abl by tyrosine phosphorylation prevented cognitive and behavioral impairments in mice with Alzheimer's disease. The results of the study support the role of c-Abl and HDAC2 in the signaling pathway of gene expression in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Currently, efforts to synthesize an HDAC2 inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are based on a pharmacophore with four features: one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrogen bond donor, and two aromatic rings. = Parkinson's Disease = HDAC inhibitors have been regarded as a potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is usually accompanied by an increase in the number of microglial proteins in the substantia nigra of the brain. In vivo evidence has shown a correlation between the number of microglial proteins and the upregulation of HDAC2. It is thought therefore that HDAC2 inhibitors could be effective in treating microglial-initiated loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. = Cancer Therapy = The role of HDAC2 in various forms of cancer such as osteosarcoma, gastric cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia have been studied. Current research is focused on creating inhibitors that decrease the upregulation of HDAC2.

Consequently, adventure is created through a person's perception of the magnitude of the potential risk, and the probability of loss. An activity with relatively low magnitude but high probability of harm (such as adventure racing or slacklining) may be just as much of an adventure as an activity with relatively high magnitude and low probability of harm (such as sport rock climbing, skydiving, or riding a roller coaster).  Outcomes of adventure education programming  Adventure education has many positive outcomes. A meta-analysis of adventure education studies identified forty major outcomes, grouped into the following six categories: leadership, self-concept, academic, personality, interpersonal, and adventuresomeness.Hattie, J., Marsh, H., Neill, J. T., & Richards, G. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of class experiences that make a lasting difference. Review of Educational Research, 67(1), 43‚Äì48. Adventure education often employs practical skills that will benefit an individual in areas beyond the activities in an adventure program. There are three theories of transfer in adventure education in which the participant may apply what they learned into future experiences.Miles, J. C., Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing. The first of these theories is \\"specific transfer\\" ‚Äì the learner applies the habits and skills learned during an experience to a new and similar experience (e.g. when an individual learns how to belay during a rock climbing experience and then applies that knowledge to rappelling). The second theory is \\"nonspecific transfer\\" ‚Äì the learner establishes some common principles acquired through previous experiences and applies them in a new learning situation (e.g. when an individual develops trust through a trust building activity). The third theory is \\"metaphoric transfer\\" ‚Äì the learner applies similar underlying principles to other areas and situations (e.g. when individuals utilize teamwork during an activity such as canoeing and later applies it to the workplace or other group experiences).Miles, J. C., Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.  Program characteristics that contribute to program outcomes  There are six categories of program characteristics that contribute to achieving the program outcomes described above. These are the physical environment, activities, processing, the group, instructors, and the participant.McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28. = Physical environment = Unfamiliar environments contribute a great deal to program outcomes experienced by adventure education participants. Being in a new environment allows participants to gain new perspectives on familiar environmentsWalsh, V. & Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School. and gives them the freedom to experiment.Kimball, R. O., & Bacon, S. B. (1993). The wilderness challenge model. In M. A. Gass (Ed.), Adventure therapy: Therapeutic applications of adventure programming (pp. 11-41). Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. An unfamiliar environment also creates some level of anxiety for the participant, as well as creating the perception of risk. Overcoming the challenges presented by unfamiliar environments through the mastery of specific tasks results in positive benefits to the individual, such as increased self-esteem.Nadler, R. S. (1993). Therapeutic process of change. In M. A. Gass (Ed.) Adventure therapy: Therapeutic applications of adventure programming (pp. 57-69). Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Positive outcomes are offered by several types of environments, including wilderness, non-wilderness (e.g. ropes-course), or a traditional classroom. However, wilderness is often considered as providing additional benefits to participants, thus being the optimal environmental setting for adventure education programs.Hattie, J., Marsh, H., Neill, J. T., & Richards, G. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of class experiences that make a lasting difference. Review of Educational Research, 67(1), 43‚Äì48. = Activities = Rather than activities themselves, it is the qualities of activities that are responsible for achieving program outcomes.McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28. The combination of challenge, mastery, and success in activities is what led to participant growth. Challenges should be holistic in order to maximize positive outcomes. Programs should include mental, emotional, and physical challenges, and encourage concurrent mastery in all three domains.Walsh, V. & Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School. Challenges should also increase incrementally, so as not to overwhelm participants early on in the program but allow them to grow and develop throughout. Activities should be well organized and matched to suit the particular needs and requirements of the participants. The GRABBS modelSchoel, J., Prouty, D., & Radcliffe, P. (1988). Islands of healing: A guide to adventure based counseling. Hamilton, MA: Project Adventure, Inc. (Goals, Readiness, Affect, Behavior, Body, and Stage of Development) is a good method for matching activities and participants. Success in the activities must be achievable. However, some failure may also be good for participant development.Witman, J. P. (1995). Characteristics of adventure programs valued by adolescents in treatment. Monograph on Youth in the 1990s, 4, 127-135. Program participants can learn from their failures to achieve success. Goal- setting is critical to achieving program outcomes, at both the individual and group levels. It is also important to allow participants to have personal choice related to activities. The \\"challenge-by-choice\\" philosophy of adventure programming allows the participant to have some autonomy related to the activities s/he participates in. While the qualities of activities are most important in achieving program outcomes, there are also specific activities that are well-suited to adventure programming.Schoel, J., Prouty, D., & Radcliffe, P. (1988). Islands of healing: A guide to adventure based counseling. Hamilton, MA: Project Adventure, Inc. These include activities related to trust and empathy (e.g. trust falls), communication, decision- making and problem solving, social responsibility, and personal responsibility. = Processing = Processing is defined as \\"the sorting and ordering of information\\" that enables program participants to internalize meaning gained from an adventure education experienceLuckner, J. L., & Nadler, R. S. (1997). Processing the experience: Strategies to enhance and generalize learning. Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Three models have been identified by which participants process meaning.Bacon, S. B. (1987). The evolution of the Outward Bound process. Greenwich, CT: Outward Bound. In the \\"Mountains Speak for Themselves\\" model, participants are responsible for reflecting on their experiences on their own, without facilitation from the instructor. In the \\"Outward Bound Plus\\" model, the instructor serves as a counselor, facilitator, and discussion leader. In the metaphoric model, activities are consciously framed so that they become experiential metaphors that can be applied to challenges in participants' daily lives. = The group = Several characteristics of the group also contribute to achieving program outcomes. In terms of the size of the group, small groups of seven to fifteen individuals are usually more conducive to achieving desired outcomes.Walsh, V. & Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School. Reciprocity within the group is also important. This refers to group members learning to cooperate with one another and capitalize on the strengths of each individual.Hopkins, D., & Putnam, R. (1993). Personal growth through adventure. London, England: David Fulton Publishers. Autonomy of individuals and personal relationships are other aspects of the group that contribute to achievement.McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28. = Instructors = Certain aspects of program instructors such as biographical characteristics, personality, and interpersonal interactions can have a large influence on participants' achievement of desired program outcomes.McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28. Instructors may be required to have a bachelor's degree in Outdoor Leadership to instruct at most Universities and community colleges. Instructors may also be required to hold certain certifications in Wilderness First Responder , American Mountain Guides Single Pitch Instructor and American Canoe Association Whitewater Instructor Certification, among many others. = The participant = The age, gender, background, and expectations of program participants have also been shown to be related to the achievement of program outcomes.McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28. Depending on the program a student is in, the program may require the student to be autonomous during expeditionary courses. Student autonomy can be beneficial to students by enhancing personal growth, an increase in self-reliance, and enhancing the overall group experience. However, student autonomy is considered to be controversial in regards to outdoor adventure educational programs, due to risk management concerns. Yet, it is recommended that the instructors of these types of programs must fully understand the risks of student autonomy prior to implementing them as part of an adventure education program.  Applications  Adventure education programming can be implemented in several contexts, including therapy for youth at risk,Cross, R. (2002).

Created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Mike Manley, the character debuted in Quasar #9 (April 1990). He was introduced as the partner of Doctor Minerva and later he was a member of the Kree superteam Starforce. He was also known as Titanium Man. The character was portrayed by Algenis Perez Soto in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Captain Marvel (2019). Publication history Captain Atlas first appeared in Quasar #9 (April 1990), created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Mike Manley. He was introduced as the new lover of Doctor Minerva, she had empowered herself and At-lass. He reappeared as a member of the Starforce team; alongside Minerva, Ronan the Accuser, Supremor, Ultimus, Korath the Pursuer and Shatterax, created by the Supreme Intelligence. The team was active during the Operation Galactic Storm, tasked with defending the Kree empire from superpowered threats. He briefly made a return during the Infinity event in as part of Spymaster's team. He had a new code name called Titanium Man. Fictional character biography Att-Lass, a native of the planet Kree-Lar, throne-world of the Kree empire, graduates from the Kree Military Academy to become a Captain in the Kree space fleet. He is given command of the Kree light cruiser Ramatam. He also becomes a warrior and special operative for the Supreme Intelligence. Taking the alias Mr. Atlas, he accompanies Doctor Minerva to an A.I.M. Weapons Exposition. He helps Minerva capture Quasar to obtain his quantum bands. He is later rescued from outer space by Quasar, but the hero forces him to leave Earth.Quasar #9-10 Captain Atlas and Doctor Minerva then explore Captain Marvel's tomb on one of Saturn's moons, looking for his nega-bands. Atlas is captured by Quasar again and attacked by Shi'ar Imperial Guard members, representatives of a galaxy spanning avian race. Atlas still manages to obtain Mar-Vell's nega-bands.Quasar #32 Atlas then battles Wonder Man on Earth, and is captured by him.Wonder Man #7 He is freed by a member of the Guard posing as Doctor Minerva, then captured by the rest of the Imperial Guard. The Shi'ar then strip him of the nega-bands,Avengers West Coast #81 and telepathic Guard member Oracle drains Atlas of strategic information. Atlas is then freed from Shi'ar captivity by Shatterax.Quasar #33 Atlas then joins the Kree Starforce. Alongside the Starforce, he fights against the Avengers on Kree-Lar. He survives the genocidal 'Nega-Bomb', which nearly wipes out Kree society. He then apparently commits suicide through the activation of his battle-suit's self-destruct program,Avengers #346-347 but actually survives and goes into hiding with Doctor Minerva.Silver Surfer #79 During the Infinity storyline, the Kree send Captain Atlas down to Earth where he poses as Titanium Man and gathers Blizzard, Constrictor, Firebrand IV, Spymaster, Unicorn, Whiplash IV, and Whirlwind to join him in a heist upon Stark Tower in order to steal the Iron Man armors there.Infinity: Heist #1 After a quick skirmish, Captain Atlas would announce that he knew where to find the buyer for the stolen Iron Man armors and teleported his \\"teammates\\" back to his ship where he revealed his true identity.Infinity: Heist #3 Iron Man eventually tracked down the villains and helped Blizzard, Constrictor, Firebrand, Unicorn, Whiplash, and Whirlwind fight Captain Atlas and Spymaster upon the two double-crossing the other villains. Before Captain Atlas can crush Iron Man to death, he is vaporized by Unicorn.Infinity: Heist #4 Powers and abilities Att-Lass was a member of the alien Kree race, and was also mutagenically altered by the Kree Psyche-Magnetron, giving him superhuman strength and durability and the power of flight. He could not breathe in Earth's atmosphere without a special apparatus or breathing serum. Att-Lass was one of the Kree Empire's most decorated soldiers, and highly accomplished in all forms of armed and unarmed combat utilized in the Kree Empire. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant. He also had the ability to pilot various Kree starships. The craftsmen and technicians of the Kree Empire constructed a number of accessories for his use as an officer of the Kree military. His helmet contains a supply of air with the same nitrogen-oxygen balance as Kree- Lar's atmosphere. Alternatively, he can employ a special serum to allow him to breathe Earth'd atmosphere without his helmet; the serum also temporarily alters his skin color to a Caucasian tone. The Kree uni-beam he wears on his wrist projects concussive energy beams and laser like-light beams generating intense heat. He was the captain of the Ramatam, and had access to the advanced technology and armament aboard the starship. He briefly wore Captain Marvel's nega-bands, which enabled him to convert psionic energy for a variety of uses, including enhancing his already superhuman strength and durability.

History  In the early 1990s, explorers such as Will Steger, Dan Buettner, Robert Ballard, Lonnie Dupree, Paul Pregont, and Mille Porsild began experimenting with ways to use technology to connect classrooms with their experiences on the trail. The Jason program (founded by Ballard) pushed the envelope of transmitting from the field as they communicated while diving the ocean, and Classroom Connect (founded by Buetner) generated a comprehensive curriculum and learning objectives tied to the field experiences, drawing in learners with their \\"student-choose-the- route\\" approach. NOMADS Online Classroom Expeditions (founded by Pregont & Porsild) facilitated the first full-scale adventure learning program with Arctic Blast 2001. Defining advances were made with student, educators and subject-matter experts being able to collaborate online on tasks within a secure space as well as participate in moderated chats using Lotus Notes, Sametime Chat, and Quickplaces, earning the IBM Beacon Award for best educational use worldwide of IBM technologies in 2002. In this way PolarHusky.com was established; the largest scale adventure learning programming to date, with participation of more than 7000 schools in 38 countries on five continents. In 2006, based upon research and collaboration with PolarHusky.com, Aaron Doering published the first established definition, framework, and guiding principles of adventure learning.

It is the second book in the Anno Dracula series and takes place during the Great War, 30 years after the first novel. Plot The book takes place during World War I and explores the Diogenes Club's efforts to investigate Germany's attempt to make powerful, undead fliers. Heading up the German operations are the likes of Rotwang, Doctor Caligari and Doctor Mabuse. One of their more successful efforts is an undead flier known as the Red Baron. The story also features Edgar Allan Poe as a vampire writer assigned to ghostwrite the Red Baron's autobiography. Setting The book is set in an alternate history universe in which Professor Van Helsing failed in his efforts to kill Count Dracula. This resulted in a vampire proliferation across the world.

Born Paul Harry Ferdinando in Bethnal Green, England on 11 November 1867, he moved in 1895 from London to Paris where he published and sold books in the rue Faubourg Montmartre and rue de Chateaudun; for a short period he moved his activities to Brussels. Carrington also published works of classical literature, including the first English translation of Aristophanes' \\"Comedies,\\" and books by famous authors such as Oscar Wilde and Anatole France, in order to hide his \\"undercover\\" erotica publications under a veil of legitimacy. His books featured the erotic art of Martin van Ma√´le. He published a French series La Flagellation a Travers le Monde mainly on English flagellation, identifying it as an English predilection. Carrington went blind as a result of syphilis and the last few years of his life were spent in poverty as his mistress stole his valuable collection of rare books. He was placed in a lunatic asylum and died in 1921 at Ivry-sur-Seine, France.

HMG-1 belongs to the high mobility group and contains a HMG-box domain.  Function  Like the histones, HMGB1 is among the most important chromatin proteins. In the nucleus HMGB1 interacts with nucleosomes, transcription factors, and histones. This nuclear protein organizes the DNA and regulates transcription. After binding, HMGB1 bends DNA, which facilitates the binding of other proteins. HMGB1 supports transcription of many genes in interactions with many transcription factors. It also interacts with nucleosomes to loosen packed DNA and remodel the chromatin. Contact with core histones changes the structure of nucleosomes. The presence of HMGB1 in the nucleus depends on posttranslational modifications. When the protein is not acetylated, it stays in the nucleus, but hyperacetylation on lysine residues causes it to translocate into the cytosol. HMGB1 has been shown to play an important role in helping the RAG endonuclease form a paired complex during V(D)J recombination.  Role in inflammation  HMGB1 is secreted by immune cells (like macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells) through leaderless secretory pathway. Activated macrophages and monocytes secrete HMGB1 as a cytokine mediator of Inflammation. Antibodies that neutralize HMGB1 confer protection against damage and tissue injury during arthritis, colitis, ischemia, sepsis, endotoxemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The mechanism of inflammation and damage consists of binding to TLR2 and TLR4, which mediates HMGB1-dependent activation of macrophage cytokine release. This positions HMGB1 at the intersection of sterile and infectious inflammatory responses. ADP-ribosylation of HMGB1 by PARP1 inhibits removal of apoptotic cells, thereby sustaining inflammation. TLR4 binding by HMGB1 or LPS (lipopolysaccharide) sustains ADP-ribosylation of HMGB1 by PARP1 thereby serving as an amplification loop for inflammation. HMGB1 has been proposed as a DNA vaccine adjuvant. HMGB1 released from tumour cells was demonstrated to mediate anti-tumour immune responses by activating Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling on bone marrow-derived GBM-infiltrating DCs.  Interactions  HMGB1 has to interact with P53. HMGB1 is a nuclear protein that binds to DNA and acts as an architectural chromatin-binding factor. It can also be released from cells, in which extracellular form it can bind the inflammatory receptor RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Release from cells seems to involve two distinct processes: necrosis, in which case cell membranes are permeabilized and intracellular constituents may diffuse out of the cell; and some form of active or facilitated secretion induced by signaling through the NF-Œ∫B. HMGB1 also translocates to the cytosol under stressful conditions such as increased ROS inside the cells. Under such conditions, HMGB1 promotes cell survival by sustaining autophagy through interactions with beclin-1. It is largely considered as an antiapoptotic protein. HMGB1 can interact with TLR ligands and cytokines, and activates cells through the multiple surface receptors including TLR2, TLR4, and RAGE. = Interaction via TLR4 = Some actions of HMGB1 are mediated through the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Interaction between HMGB1 and TLR4 results in upregulation of NF-Œ∫B, which leads to increased production and release of cytokines. HMGB1 is also able to interact with TLR4 on neutrophils to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species by NADPH oxidase. HMGB1-LPS complex activates TLR4, and causes the binding of adapter proteins (MyD88 and others), leading to signal transduction and the activation of various signaling cascades. The downstream effect of this signaling is to activate MAPK and NF-Œ∫B, and thus cause the production of inflammatory molecules such as cytokines.  Clinical significance  HMGB1 has been proposed as a target for cancer therapy, and as a vector for reducing inflammation from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is caused by mutation in the ataxin 1 gene. In a mouse model of SCA1, mutant ataxin 1 protein mediated the reduction or inhibition of HMGB1 in the mitochondria of neurons. HMGB1 regulates DNA architectural changes essential for repair of DNA damage. In the SCA1 mouse model, over-expression of the HMGB1 protein by means of an introduced virus vector bearing the HMGB1 gene facilitated repair of the mitochondrial DNA damage, ameliorated the neuropathology and the motor defects of the SCA1 mice, and also extended their lifespan. Thus impairment of HMGB1 function appears to have a key role in the pathogenesis of SCA1.

The enzyme () has also been known as matrin, putative (or punctuated) metalloproteinase-1, matrix metalloproteinase pump 1, PUMP-1 proteinase, PUMP, metalloproteinase pump-1, putative metalloproteinase, MMP). Matrilysin was discovered by Sellers and Woessner in the uterus of the rat in 1988. The complementary DNA (cDNA) of human MMP7 was isolated in 1988 by Muller et al. MMP7 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family consisting of structural-related zinc-dependent endopeptidases. The primary role of cleaved/activated MMP7 is to break down extracellular matrix by degrading macromolecules including casein, type I, II, IV, and V gelatins, fibronectin, and proteoglycan.  Gene, regulation, and expression  The human MMP7 is located on chromosome 11 q22.3. MMP genes are clustered in q region of human Chromosome 11 including matrilysin, collagenase-1, stromelysin1, stromelysin-2, and metalloelastase genes. It consists of 267 amino acids. The cDNA of MMP7 is 49% homologous to stromelysin-1. Comparing to other members of MMP family, MMP7 does not have a C-terminal protein domain. The promoter of the human MMP7 contains a TATA box, an activator protein 1 (AP-1) site, and two inverted polyomavirus enhancer A-binding proteins 2 (PEA-3). The AP-1/PEA-3 binding motif is required and essential for MMP7 to be responsive to growth factors, oncogenes and phorbol ester. Also, the PEA and AP-1 are required for Matrilysin/CAT reporter constructs induced by tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoulphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). In addition, the high level expression of AP-1 and its binding proteins were found to be associated with mutant Ki-Ras suggesting the high expression of matrilysin in Ras activated cells is AP-1 dependent. The expression of MMP7 is regulated by the Wnt/ Œ≤ catenin signaling pathway, and mediated by transformation growth factor Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤).TGF-Œ≤ stimulates ECM and suppresses the steady-state level of MMP7, stromelysin mRNAs, and secretion of zymogens. The isoforms of TGF-Œ≤ inhibit MMP7 mRNA and protein in the human endometrium via progesterone mediated pathway. However, the opposite effects of TGF-Œ≤ on MMP7 were observed among transformed cells. In human glioma cell lines and human squamous cell carcinoma cell line II-4, TGF-Œ≤ stimulates the expression of MMP7 mRNA and proteins, and facilities the invasive behavior of cells. The promoter region of the human MMP7 gene contains two or more sites that are homologous to the NR-IL6 binding sequences indicating MMP7 can bind to IL-1 and IL-6. In addition, the level of MMP7 mRNA is elevated followed the treatment of tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNF- Œ±) and IL-1 Œ≤ in human mesangial cells. MMP7 are commonly expressed in epithelial cells including ductal epithelium of exocrine glands in skin, salivary glands, pancreas, glandular epithelium of intestine and reproductive organ, liver, and breast. In addition, MMP7 is highly expressed in the luminal surface of dysplastic glands in human colorectal cancers.  Structure  A MMP7 protein is bounded by four metal ions including a catalytic zinc ion, a structural zinc ion, and two calcium ions. The catalytic zinc ion binds to three His residues in the HEXGHXXGXXH region in tetracoordination. The calcium ion binding play important role in stabilizing the secondary structure. MMP7 has a shallow hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket. In contrast to MMP9 which has the longest hinge, MMP7 lacks hemopexin and does not have a hinge. Instead, MMP7 contains a variable C-terminal hemopexin-like domain facilitates substrate specificity. The protein of MMP7 is secreted as zymogen. The prodoamin of MMP7 contains an approximately 9 kD highly conserved ‚Äúcysteine switch‚Äù PRCGXPD sequence near the C-terminal containing cysteine residues. Cysteine residues bind to the catalytic zinc keeping the protein latent. The dissociation of cysteine ‚ÄìZinc coordination starts from the cleavage of the first 30 amino acids of the prodomain, which leads to a conformation change, and further results in autoproteolysis and the cleavage of the whole prodomain at Glu-Tyr site. According to Woessner et al., the Mr of MMP7 is 28,000 for the latent form and 19,000 Mr for the active form after the cleavage of its prodomain.  Interactions  Promatrilysin (Pro-MMP7) is converted from the latent form to the active form by endoproteinases, and plasmin. Plasmin cleaves at the site recognizable to trypsin, is considered as the most possible physiological activator. In vitro, plasmin can activate pro-MMP7 to 50% of its full activity. Also, researchers used activated recombinant pro-MMP7 and purified substrates to investigate the proteolytic activity of MMp7 in vitro, and found that MMP7 cleaves many protein substrates mainly including ECM components, proMMPs, and nonmatrix proteins. MMP7 cleaves the glycoprotein entactin that links laminin and collagen IV at about 100-600 times faster than collagenase-1. In addition, MMP7 can activate other MMPs. Activated MMP7 and APMA can increase the activity of collagenase-1, and MMP7 can also convert the latent progelatinase A to its active form.  Function  Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. The enzyme encoded by this gene degrades proteoglycans, fibronectin, elastin and casein and differs from most MMP family members in that it lacks a conserved C-terminal protein domain. The enzyme is involved in wound healing, and studies in mice suggest that it regulates the activity of defensins in intestinal mucosa. MMP7 was initially characterized by Woessner et al. It digests components of the extracellular matrix, cleaves the Œ± 2 (I) chain of gelatin more rapidly, and digests the B chain of insulin at Ala14-Leu and Tyr16-Leu, and has no action on collagen types I, II, IV, V. The optimal pH of MMP7 is at 7 and the pI is at 5.9. MMP4 is inhibited by Œ± 2-macroglobulin and TIMP. The inhibition of MMP7 activity commonly relies on metal-chelating agents including EDTA and 1,10-phenantroline, especially zinc chelation. Therefore, the selectivity of MMP7 inhibition is challenging since almost all members of MMPs family contain catalytic domains with zinc binding sites. TIMP-1 and 2 noncovalently bound to active MMP7 at the catalytic site inhibiting MMP7 activity. The activated MMP7 can also cleave the propeptides of proMMP2 and proMMP9 to facilitate tumor invasion. =Normal tissue development= Quondamatteo et al. immunohistochemically stained MMP7, and localized MMP7 in early human liver development. They reported that MMP7 was presented in some hepatocytes and endothelial cells in the 6th gestational week, and only hematopoietic cells remained after that time. =Tissue remodeling= In order for MMPs to escape TIMP inhibition, active MMP7s are recruited to the plasma membrane of epithelium inducing membrane-associated growth factors processing for epithelial repair and proliferation. In human endometrium, the expression of MMP7 mRNA increases at menstruation and remains high during the proliferative phase. Also, MMP-7 binds to the plasma membrane of epithelium containing cholesterol-rich domain. The bounded MMP7 is active and resistant to TIMP inhibition. It promotes the activity of the epithelial plasma membrane and associated substrates including E-cadherin, Œ≤4-integrin, TNF-alpha, RAS, heparin-binding EGF, IGF binding proteins and plasminogen. Further, this process promotes epithelial cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. For menstruation, it promotes the endometrium regeneration after menstrual breakdown. Huang et al. reported that the proteolytic activity of MMP7 plays major role in tissue remodeling in biliary atresia-associated liver fibrosis.  Clinical significance  MMP7 cleaves collagen III/IV/V/IX/X/XI and proteoglycan indicating that MMP inhibitors can potentially be used in therapies that involved in inhibition tissue degradation, remodeling, anti- angiogenesis and inhibition of tumor invasion. = Role in Cancer = MMP7 is found to potentially involved in tumor metastasis and inflammatory processes. The upregulation of MMP7 is associated with many malignant tumors including esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, pancreas, and renal cell carcinomas. High MMP7 expression facilitates cancer invasion and angiogenesis by degrading extracellular matrix macromolecules and connective tissues. These degradations are associated with many mechanisms including embryogenesis, postpartum uterine involution, tissue repair, angiogenesis, bone remodeling, arthritis, decubitus ulcer, and tumor metastasis/invasion. Activated MMP7 activates MMP2 and MMP9 zymogens, and mediates the proteolytic process of the precursors of tumor necrosis factors and urokinase plasminogen activators. = Colon cancer and MMP7 expression = MMP7 cleaves cell surface proteins, promotes adhesion of cancer cells, and increases the potential of tumor metastasis. Higashi et al. reported that the binding of MMP7 to cholesterol sulfate on the cell surface plays a critical role in the cell membrane-related proteolytic action. Also, the internal Ile 29, Arg33, Arg51, and Trp 55 and 171-173 residues at MMP7 C-terminal located on the opposite side of the catalytic site of MMP7 are required for cholesterol sulfate binding. Wildtype MMP7 can digest fibronectin, but mutant MMP7 fails to induce the aggregation of colon cancer cells. In addition, Qasim et al. reported that MMP7 is highly expressed in advanced colorectal adenomatous polys with severe dysplasia. Further, MMP7 is involved in converting colorectal adenomas into malignant state and facilitating the growth.

Steidle wrote a book, The Devil Came on Horseback, about his experience, which was turned into a documentary film that premiered at Sundance in 2007. Steidle has shared his experience in Darfur with heads of state in the United States and abroad, addressed the U.S. Congress and the United Nations, and serves both as lecturer and advisor to several non- government organizations regarding their humanitarian efforts in Africa and other nations. Prior to his work in Darfur, Steidle, the son of a high-ranking U.S. Navy officer, served in the United States Marine Corps from 1999 to 2003 as an infantry officer, completing his service with the rank of Captain. Work in Sudan After his service he took a contract in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan working for the Joint Military Mission, a collaboration between 12 European nations, the US and Canada, monitoring the North-South Cease fire, now Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Starting as a team leader of a four-man team directly negotiating tense situations, he advanced to a sector commander and on to the Senior Operations Officer for the entire Joint Military Mission within 7 months. Darfur In September 2004, at the age of 27, Steidle accepted an assignment as one of three U.S. military observers for the African Union in the Darfur region of western Sudan. His role was to monitor the cease fire between the two main rebel groups and the Sudanese Government. Additional roles included advising the AU on US personnel, operations, logistics and intelligence. Steidle witnessed the murders of thousands of people, but was not permitted to intervene, though he photographed what he witnessed. After his 13-month contract in Sudan was completed, Brian resigned the position and returned to the United States. Steidle returned to Chad in 2006 to further document and publicize the events taking place there. Steidle wrote of his experiences in Darfur in his book The Devil Came on Horseback, a reference to the Janjaweed faction that has been responsible for much of the genocide in Darfur. An award-winning and Emmy nominated documentary film of the same title was also produced about Steidle's story. The film is a Break Thru Films production in association with Global Grassroots and Three Generations.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0912580 The film received significant charitable funding including grants from the Save Darfur Coalition and the Sundance Film Festival. Steidle appears throughout the film, narrating what he witnessed and interviewing survivors in Darfur. Quote: ‚ÄúDarfur is more than an occasional headline in the newspaper or 20 seconds on a forgotten nightly newscast. It is where genocide continues to happen while the rest of the world goes through the motion of concern but does nothing of substance to stop it. Will the world ever wake up?‚Äù US Since his return from Sudan, Steidle has spoken at more than 500 venues including Harvard Law School, Princeton, UCLA, West Point and the US Naval Academy. His book has been incorporated into the curriculum of several of these schools. He has testified in the US Congress, UK Parliament, and at the UN Human Rights Council, providing expertise on Sudan and raising awareness of human rights violations and atrocities. He acted as Security and Logistics officer for several NGOs during trips to Chad, Kenya, and Rwanda, coordinating all aspects of route planning, contingency planning, evacuation plans, security threat, criminal or enemy situations, and situational updates. Steidle is a proven African expert, providing guidance and strategic advice including intelligence gathering, NGO Operations, AU effectiveness, war crimes, human rights violations and Sudanese military operations to NGOs, The International Criminal Court, Department of State, DOD, SOCOM, EUCOM, AFRICOM, and DHS ICE. He has also conducted Peace Support Operations Training for the Malawian Defense Force in 2009 prior to their deployment to Eastern Chad. Haiti From Jan‚ÄìMay 2010, Steidle acted as a consultant and volunteer in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, following the devastating earthquake. He assisted US security forces in implementation of force protection plans for US government and NGO agencies, and developed, planned, coordinated, and implemented evasion plans and a personnel recovery capability for several NGOs. He conducted search and rescue and recovery efforts at the Hotel Montana, P√©tion-Ville, Haiti. In addition to this he coordinated transportation, security, support and guidance to NGOs and volunteers. Using his military experience and desire to help those less fortunate he advised the Haitian Ministry of Justice, Police Chief and SWAT Commanders during human trafficking investigations. In addition, he helped with the installation of solar lighting and charging stations in Port-au-Prince, Haiti; constructed slow-sand water filters and provided them to communities; field tested the Seldon Technology Water Box and providing insight on possible improvements; provided clean drinking water to hundreds of families through the use of the Water Box; and conducted an initial analysis of plastic recycling facility in PaP for potential investors.

Schmidt, the author of Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy. The novel is set in suburban Long Island during the 1967‚Äì68 school year. The Vietnam War is an important backdrop for the novel. It was given a Newbery Honor medal in 2008, and was also nominated for the Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Book Award in 2010. Synopsis Holling Hoodhood is a seventh grader during the 1967-1968 school year. In his school, the student body is largely divided between Catholics and Jews, and every Wednesday both groups go to their separate churches for religious classes. Holling, a Presbyterian, has no religious class to attend, therefore he is forced to remain at class with his teacher, Mrs. Baker. Holling is convinced that Mrs. Baker resents him for this. This suspicion is compounded when she begins having him read Shakespeare. As he begins to enjoy the plays, though, he also begins to understand Mrs. Baker, whose husband, he learns, is stationed in Vietnam. The story's main focus is on Holling's struggle to get out from his overbearing father's shadow. Mr. Hoodhood is an ambitious, social climbing, and at times, the cutthroat architect who is determined that Holling take over the business when he retires. In fact, Mr. Hoodhood believes that nothing is more important than their family business and ensuring that it flourishes. Because of this, all of the Hoodhoods must be on their best behavior at all times. Whenever Holling brings up a particular person, his father breaks down who the person is, as well as their status; if they're someone who owns a business, Mr. Hoodhood demands Holling to be respectful at all times. This causes a strained relationship between Holling and his father. Holling ultimately finds an ally in his older sister, Heather, and eventually comes to understand that Mrs. Baker is also trying to help him learn to be his own person. Other subplots in the story include: Holling entering track and field; running the big race for track; going on his first date with classmate Meryl Lee Kowalski, whose father is of the other architecture firm in town, Kowalski and Associates; his sister Heather running away to California with her boyfriend; and the ever-present shadow of the Vietnam War ‚Äî as well as other historical events, such as the shootings of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.. In addition, television news anchorman Walter Cronkite is mentioned throughout the novel, as an important presence while delivering the news. Cronkite is presented as the voice of the people, with the ability to sway Americans to a particular side. The plot follows a steady, progression-focused format, lacking any clear climax. Instead, it simply follows Holling as he struggles through school, forms friends out of supposed enemies, and tries to grow up.  Connections to Schmidt's other novels  Characters from The Wednesday Wars have appeared in Schmidt's other novels. Holling's friend Doug Swieteck is the main character of Okay for Now, and Doug's brother Lucas appears as Jack and Joseph's gym coach in Orbiting Jupiter, set many years later. Just Like That, set to be released in 2021, features Meryl Lee Kowalski as its main character. Publication history  Critical reception Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"another virtuoso turn by the author of Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy (2005)\\" in its starred review.

Overview The scheme was launched in 2005 in a JD Wetherspoon outlet in Biddulph.Challenge 21 The scheme has since been taken over by the Retail of Alcohol Standards Group (RASG). According to government figures the scheme has been successful in reducing the number of under-18s gaining access to alcohol.Home Office  Press Office  Underage alcohol sales down In May 2007, it was reported that Asda stores in Scotland were operating a Challenge 25 scheme, whereby anyone who appeared to be below the age of 25, seven years above the age required to buy alcohol in the UK, could be asked to provide a form of ID such as a passport, driving licence or PASS-accredited proof of age card.Asda raises bar over ID  Off Licence News - The Voice Of Drinks Retailing As of 2011, the four main supermarket chains (Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons), Marks & Spencer, The Co-operative, Bargain Booze and Waitrose all apply the Challenge 25 policy. Some have further rules, such as requiring ID from all members of a group in order to proceed with the sale (leading to adults well over 25 sometimes being refused service when shopping with a younger partner, friend or child). Furthermore, some supermarkets have trialled a policy of asking all alcohol purchasers for ID irrespective of apparent age, which has led to senior citizens as old as 86 being refused service. In many of the large supermarket chains, including Marks & Spencer, The Co-operative and Waitrose, a shop assistant found selling alcohol to an underage person is liable to severe punishment by their employer, including possible dismissal, in addition to the standard legal penalties. In any of these companies, the 'Think 25' policy is drilled into all employees very stringently. Many independent off-licences continue to apply Challenge 21; enforcement is less stringent in many of these establishments. Other off- licences such as the food halls of Selfridges and Harvey Nichols, Spirited Wines, and the long established shops around Soho are not currently members of the RASG. Some Tesco stores have experimented with a Challenge 30 policy dismissing the criticism that it could have an adverse effect on sales. In recent years pubs and supermarkets have come under increasing pressure from the government to prevent the sale of alcohol to under 18s.http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/alcohol-industry-underage- sales.html Currently the law comes down much heavier on those selling the alcohol than those illegally buying it. The police regularly send young people who appear underage into pubs to try to purchase alcohol. Pubs, managers and staff members face fines for being caught. Repeat offenders face a risk of losing their licence. Pubs are responding by training their staff to ask people for proof of age if they can't immediately tell if a customer is old enough and as a way of encouraging vigilance are likely to sack staff members who get caught selling alcohol to underage people by the police.  Scotland  The Alcohol etc. Scotland Act 2010 required all licensed premises in Scotland to have an age verification policy which would require age to be verified if it appeared to the person selling alcohol that the customer was under 25.

At Toul, it became part of Twelfth Air Force. Although a reconnaissance wing had been located at Toul earlier in the year, construction of the base was still underway, so the 781st Squadron was located at Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany and the 782d Squadron was at Neubiberg Air Base, Germany.Maurer, Combat Squadrons. p. 753Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 754 The group was still assigned to the 465th Wing, which remained in the United States until late December, when it became clear that the wing's deployment to Europe would be delayed, and the group was assigned to Twelfth Air Force. The squadron participated in airlift operations, tests and exercises in Europe. Although the group mission was troop carrier, there were few American airborne troops in Europe, and the group's missions focused on theater airlift flights, particularly supporting fighter units deploying to Wheelus Air Base for training at the ranges there. Construction progressed and on 1 April 1954, the 465th Wing finally moved to Toul and by the start of the following month the 781st and 782d Squadrons also joined the group. In late May 1955, the group moved to √âvreux-Fauville Air Base, France, becoming the first USAF tactical unit on the base. Evreaux had been the wing's intended base in France, but construction had been delayed and it was not able to house the group until 1954.McAuliffe, p. 311 The group became non-operational in March 1956 when the 465th Wing began to transition to the dual deputy organization structure.

Manasa is the mother of Astika, sister of Vasuki, king of NƒÅgas (snakes) and wife of sage Jaratkaru.Wilkins p.395 She is also known as Vishahara (the destroyer of poison), NityƒÅ (eternal) and Padmavati. Her myths emphasize her bad temper and unhappiness, due to rejection by her father Shiva and her husband, and the hate of her stepmother, Chandi (Shiva's wife, identified with Parvati in this context). In some scriptures, sage Kashyapa is considered to be her father, not Shiva. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa‚Äôs aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees. Manasa is depicted as being kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her.McDaniel p.148. Origins As per McDaniel, Manasa was originally a Adivasi (tribal) goddess. She was accepted in the pantheon worshipped by Hindu lower caste groups. Later, she was included in higher caste Hindu pantheon, where she is now regarded as a Hindu goddess rather than a tribal one.McDaniel p.148 Bhattacharya and Sen suggest that Manasa originated in South India as a non-Vedic and non-Aryan goddess and is related to the Kannada folk snake-goddess Manchamma. Dimock suggests that though snake worship is found in the Vedas (the earliest Hindu scriptures), Manasa - a human goddess of snakes - has \\"little basis\\" in early Hinduism. Bhattacharya suggests another influence on Manasa being the Mahayana Buddhist goddess of poison-cure Janguli. Janguli shares his swan vehicle and her poison-destroyer epithet with Manasa. Manasa is also known as Jaguli. A theory suggests that Janguli may have influenced by the Kirata-giri (\\"the conquerer of all posions\\") of the Atharvaveda. According to Tate, Manasa as Jaratkaru was initially recognized as a daughter of sage Kashyapa and Kadru, the mother of all NƒÅgas in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. According to Bhattacharya, the Jaratkaru of the Mahabharata is not the Manasa popular in Bengal. According to Tate: By the 14th century, Manasa was identified as the goddess of fertility and marriage rites and was assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon, related to the god Shiva. Myths glorified her by describing that she saved Shiva after he drank the poison, and venerated her as the \\"remover of poison\\". Her popularity grew and spread to southern India, and her followers began to rival Shaivthe earliestism (the cult of Shiva). As a consequence, stories attributing Manasa's birth to Shiva emerged and ultimately Shaivism adopted this indigenous goddess into the Brahmanical tradition of mainstream Hinduism. Alternatively, S B Dasgupta suggests that the Bengali tale of Manasa reflects rivalry between Shaivism and the Goddess-centric Shaktism. Iconography Pala bronze from modern-day Bihar. Manasa is depicted as a woman covered with snakes, sitting on a lotus or standing upon a snake. She is sheltered by the canopy of the hoods of seven cobras. Sometimes, she is depicted with a child on her lap. The child is assumed to be her son, Astika. Legends =Mahabharata= The Mahabharata tells the story of Manasa's marriage. Sage JagatkƒÅru practised severe austerities and had decided to abstain from marriage. Once he came across a group of men hanging from a tree upside down. These men were his ancestors, who were doomed to misery as their children had not performed their last rites. So they advised JagatkƒÅru to marry and have a son who could free them of those miseries by performing the ceremonies. Vasuki offered his sister Manasa's hand to JagatkƒÅru. Manasa gave birth to a son, Astƒ´ka, who freed his ancestors. Astika also helped in saving the NƒÅga race from destruction when King Janamejaya decided to exterminate them by sacrificing them in his Yajna, fire offering.Wilkins p.396 =Puranas= The goddess ManasƒÅ in a dense jungle landscape with snakes. The Puranas are the first scriptures to speak about her birth. They declare that sage Kashyapa is her father, not Shiva as described in the later Mangalkavyas. Once, when serpents and reptiles had created chaos on the Earth, Kashyapa created the goddess Manasa from his mind (mana). The creator god Brahma made her the presiding deity of snakes and reptiles. Manasa gained control over the earth, by the power of mantras she chanted. Manasa then propitiated the god Shiva, who told her to please the god Krishna. Upon being pleased, Krishna granted her divine Siddhi powers and ritually worshiped her, making her an established goddess. Kashyapa married Manasa to sage Jaratkaru, who agreed to marry her on the condition that he would leave her if she disobeyed him. Once, when Jaratkaru was awakened by Manasa, he became upset with her because she awakened him too late for worship, and so he left her temporarily. On the request of the great Hindu gods, Jaratkaru returned to Manasa and she gave birth to Astika, their son, before deserting his wife again. =Mangalkavyas= Mud idol of Manasa in the Sundarbans, West Bengal, India. The Mangalkavyas were devotional paeans to local deities such as Manasa, composed in Bengal between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The Manasa Mangalkavya by Vijay Gupta and Manasa Vijaya (1495) by Bipradas Pipilai trace the origin and myths of the goddess. However these stray further from Puranaic references probably due to creative licenses exercised. At least fifteen Mangalkavyas dedicated to Manasa are known. Scholar D. C. Sen traced fifty-one versions of her tale. According to Manasa Vijaya, Manasa was born when a statue of girl that had been sculpted by Vasuki's mother was touched by Shiva's seed. Vasuki accepted Manasa as his sister, and granted her charge of the poison that was produced when King Prithu milked the Earth as a cow. When Shiva saw Manasa, he was attracted to her, but she proved to him that he was her father. Shiva took Manasa to his home where his wife, Chandi, suspected Manasa of being Shiva's concubine or co-wife, and insulted Manasa and burnt one of her eyes, leaving Manasa half-blind. Later, when Shiva was dying of poison, Manasa cured him. On one occasion, when Chandi kicked her, Manasa rendered her senseless with a glance of her poison eye. Finally, tired of quarrels between Manasa and Chandi, Shiva deserted Manasa under a tree, but created a companion for her from his tears of remorse, called Neto or NetƒÅ.McLean p. 66 Later, the sage Jaratkaru married Manasa, but Chandi ruined Manasa's wedding night. Chandi advised Manasa to wear snake ornaments and then threw a frog in the bridal chamber which caused the snakes to run around the chamber. As a consequence, the terrified Jaratkaru ran away from the house. After few days, he returned and Astika, their son, was born.McDaniel p. 149-51 A scene from Manasa Mangal. Accompanied by her adviser, Neto, Manasa descended to earth to see human devotees. She was initially mocked by the people but then Manasa forced them to worship her by raining calamity on those who denied her power. She managed to convert people from different walks of life, including the Muslim ruler Hasan, but failed to convert Chand Sadagar . Manasa wanted to become a goddess like Lakshmi or Saraswati. To get there she had to achieve the worship of Chand Sadagar who was extremely adamant and took oath not to worship Manasa. Thus to gain his fear and insecurity, Manasa one by one killed his six sons . At last Manasa conspired against two dancers of Indras Court who loved each other, Anirudha and Usha . Anirudh had to take birth as Lakhinder, Chand and Sanaka's seventh son. Usha took birth as behula and married him. Manasa killed him but Behula floated on water for nine months with the dead body of her husband and finally brought back the lives of the seven sons and the lost prosperity of Chand. At last, he yielded by offering a flower to the goddess with his left hand without even looking at her. This gesture made Manasa so happy that she resurrected all of Chand's sons and restored his fame and fortunes. The Mangal kavyas say that after this, the worship of Manasa was popular forever. Manasa Mangalkavya attributes Manasa's difficulty in attracting devotees to an unjust curse she gave to Chand in his previous life. Chand then retaliated with a counter-curse that worshiping her would not be popular on earth unless he worshiped her also.McDaniel p.152 Ananda K. Coomaraswamy and Sister Nivedita say, \\"[The] legend of [Chand Sadagar and] ManasƒÅ Devƒ´, [...] who must be as old as the Mykenean stratum in Asiatic society, reflects the conflict between the religion of Shiva and that of female local deities in Bengal. Afterwards ManasƒÅ or PadmƒÅ was recognized as a form of Shakti, [...] and her worship accepted by Shaivas. She is a phase of the mother-divinity who for so many worshipers is nearer and dearer than the far-off and impersonal Shiva...\\". Worship Generally, Manasa is worshiped without an image. A branch of a tree, an earthen pot or an earthen snake image is worshiped as the goddess, though images of Manasa are worshipped too. She is worshiped for protection from and cure of snake bites and infectious diseases like smallpox and chicken pox. The cult of Manasa is most widespread in Bengal, where she is ritually worshiped in temples. The goddess is widely worshiped in the rainy season, when the snakes are most active. Manasa is also a very important fertility deity, especially among the lower castes, and her blessings are invoked during marriage or for childlessness. She is usually worshiped and mentioned along with Neto, who is called Neta, Netidhopani, Netalasundori, etc. in various parts of Bengal. In North Bengal, among the Rajbanshis, Manasa (called Bishohora, Bishohori or Padmavati) is one of the most important goddesses, and her thaan (shrine) may be found in the courtyard of almost every agrarian household. Among the lower- caste Hindus of East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh)too, she is worshiped with great pomp. Manasa is an especially important deity in Bengal for the mercantile castes. This is because Chando of the Manasamangal was the first to initiate her worship, and Behula, the heroine of the Manasamangal was a daughter of the Saha clan (a powerful trading community). Manasa is also worshiped extensively in Assam and Tripura, and a kind of Oja-Pali (musical folk theatre) is dedicated entirely to her myth. Manasa is ceremonially worshiped on Nag Panchami - a festival of snake worship in the Hindu month of Shravan (July‚ÄìAugust). Bengali women observe a fast (vrata) on this day and offer milk at snake holes.McDaniel (2002) p.55-57 In South India people started recently worshipping Goddess Manasa Devi Temple in Mukkamala located in West Godavari, Andhra Pradesh.

He was the 27th hereditary chieftain of the Nanbu clan Toshinao was the eldest son of Nanbu Nobunao, and was born at the clan‚Äôs Tago Castle in Sannohe. In 1590, Nobunao submitted to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the SIege of Odawara and was confirmed as daimy≈ç of his existing holdings in northern Mutsu province (the districts of Nukanobu, Hei, Kazuno, Kuji, Iwate, Shiwa and T≈çno). During the same year Maeda Toshiie, one of Hideyoshi‚Äôs closest generals, presided over Toshinao's genpuku ceremony, and granted him the kanji of \\"Toshi\\" in his name. In 1594, he married the daughter of Gam≈ç Ujisato. Hideyoshi also helped suppress the Kunohe Rebellion, which enabled Nobunao and Toshinao to unite the many local factions of the Nanbu clan into a more centralized administration. In 1595, Toshinao was awarded Court rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade and the formal courtesy title of Shinano-no- kami. Following the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1598, he drew close to Tokugawa Ieyasu politically. Upon Nanbu Nobunao‚Äôs death in 1599, he became clan chieftain. In the prelude to the Battle of Sekigahara, Ishida Mitsunari ordered Tokugawa Ieyasu north to attack Uesugi Kagekatsu in Aizu. During this campaign, Toshinao led the Nanbu forces at the Siege of Hased≈ç. However, during the Battle of Sekigahara, Date Masamune and Waga Tadachika organised a large scale revolt in the Nanbu southern territories of Waga and Hienuki, which was only suppressed with difficulty in 1601. In 1614, he participated in the Winter Campaign of Siege of Osaka. As daimyo, Toshinao developed copper mines in his territories, which helped place the domain on a stable financial footing. In 1615, he completed Morioka Castle and the surrounding castle town, and many inhabitants of Sannohe moved south to settle around the new center of power. He is also credited with inventing the regional speciality, wanko soba, while stopping at Hanamaki on his way to Edo for sankin-k≈çtai. In 1626 he was elevated to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. He died at the clan's Sakuradaya residence in Edo in 1632 at the age of 57, and was succeeded by his son, Nanbu Shigenao. His grave was originally at the temple of Sh≈çju-ji in Sannohe, but was later relocated to the Nanbu clan mortuary temple of T≈çzen-ji in Morioka. References *Papinot, Edmond. (1948).

The school was administered by the British Families Education Service, which provided for the education of the children of British armed forces personnel stationed overseas. Its official name was 'BAC Bourne School' (British Army Children's School). The school was named after Lt. General Sir Geoffrey Bourne. Teachers would generally be drawn from the United Kingdom and work at the school for a two-year period, although many remained for longer periods. History of Bourne School At the height of the Malayan Emergency in May 1954, Lt. General Sir Geoffrey Bourne, the military commander of the British Forces, officially opened a group of temporary hutments for the education of servicemen's children. From that day the school grew in size and prestige until the name of Bourne became an accepted part of the educational pattern in Malaya and the Federal capital In September 1957 the first boarding houses were opened to accommodate the children of service families stationed elsewhere in Malaya. In the same year Headquarters Malaya Command was moved to Seremban and, as the families gradually followed, the need for boarding accommodation increased. Girls and junior boys were boarded in Arakan House near the School and Istana Hostel, a former palace of the Sultan of Selangor, was taken over for the senior boys. Travel to and from the school for \\"Boarders\\" was by local transport Trains and Ferries from all parts of the Malay peninsular, for example lists were made showing students detraining at the Penang Ferry Rail Station Pupils returning from Bourne School at the end of term With the ending of the emergency and the run-down of British Military personnel in Malaya, the school opened its doors to fee- paying children of the many nationalities resident in Kuala Lumpur. Altogether children of 22 different countries received an English style education at Bourne. Some 5000 children between the ages of 11 and 18 passed through Bourne during its ten years of life. Many took and passed the London General Certificate of Education and other external examinations. The school always took an active part in the sporting activities of the country. Although its small numbers prevented it winning many inter-school games. In 1964 Ivan Myall and Marion Jolley and Sheila Waterman swam for Malaya and were selected for the Malaysian Swimming Team. Lorraine Howell played in the Malaysian Ladies Hockey Team. Ivan Myall also had the distinction of winning the Malaya Junior Open Chess Championships. Throughout the years many Bourne schoolchildren have represented Selangor in inter-state swimming championships.

He was the 28th hereditary chieftain of the Nanbu clan. His courtesy title was Yamashiro-no-kami, and his Court rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. Shigenao was the 3rd son of Nanbu Toshinao, and was born at the clan‚Äôs Sakurada residence in Edo. He became daimy≈ç on the death of his father in 1632. During his tenure, Morioka Castle was completed, and he laid out the streets of the surrounding castle town in a grid network. Of severe disposition, he had no heir and adopted a son of Hotta Masamori, daimy≈ç of Sakura Domain, which also opened the possibility for the clan to change to fudai daimy≈ç status. However, in April 1636, his sankin-k≈çtai procession arrived in Edo ten days late, which was a violation of the new Buke shohatto regulations issued by sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu, and he was declared unfit to govern, and sentenced to house arrest at the clan residence in Edo. After his death in Edo in 1664, the Tokugawa shogunate intervened, and by order of Shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna appointed his younger brother Shichinohe Shigenobu as the next daimy≈ç, with the son of Hotta Masamori reduced to hatamoto status. The kokudaka of Morioka Domain was also reduced by 20,000 koku to 80,000 koku, with the creation of Hachinohe Domain for Shigenao‚Äôs third brother, Nakasato Naoyoshi, who was renamed Nanbu Naofusa.

Location  Laid in 1911, the road is 550 metres long. Both ends of the L-shaped road join to North Sichuan Road near Lu Xun Park and Hongkou Stadium. The road is today reconstructed as a pedestrian street.  History  210 Duolun Rd, former residence of Bai Chongxi Darroch (Duolun) Road was built by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the municipal authority of the Shanghai International Settlement. It was an \\"extra-settlement road\\" (), built outside the boundaries of the International Settlement, but over which the Settlement authorities had extraterritorial jurisdiction. It was named after John Darroch, a British missionary to China who had been received by the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. A primarily residential street, the golden age of the road was in the 1920s and 30s, when it attracted writers and other prominent residents, giving it a reputation as a vibrant centre of thought and literature. In 1943, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the puppet government collaborating with the Japanese occupation changed the road name to \\"Duolun\\", after a county in Inner Mongolia. It became an ordinary residential street, until a revived interest in Republican-era history led at the end of the 20th century to it becoming a popular tourist and shopping destination, and the closure of the street to traffic.  Notable residents  In the early 20th century, many writers and celebrities lived in the area around Darroch Road. Among them were famous writers such as Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao, and Wang Zaoshi, as well as members of the influential League of Left-Wing Writers including Ding Ling, Sha Ding and Qu Qiubai. The League itself was founded on Darroch Road. High-ranking political and military leaders H. H. Kung, Bai Chongxi, Tang Enbo and Chen Yi also lived there.  Architecture  Fitch Memorial Church Duolun Road is representative of the historic architecture of the 20th century in Shanghai. A number of larger private residences were initially built by Chinese industrialists, and many were later purchased by political and military personalities. Prominent private residences include the Islamic-style influenced former residence of H.H. Kung; No. 210, which was for a time the home of Bai Chongxi (and Pai Hsien-yung); and the French neoclassical former residence of Tang Enbo. Fitch Memorial Church (called \\"Hongde Tang\\" (È∏øÂæ∑Â†Ç) in Chinese), named after George Field Fitch (Ë≤ªÂïüÈ¥ª) is a unique mixture of Chinese and western architectural styles, the only such mixed-style church to survive in Shanghai. The former campus of China Art University (‰∏≠ÂçéËâ∫ÊúØÂ§ßÂ≠¶), in traditional style, was also where the League of Left-Wing Writers was founded. In the surrounding blocks, there is a well-preserved area of dense lilong housing (including both Shikumen and newer styles), showcasing the typical urban texture of Shanghai-style residential architecture.  Regeneration and today  In order to counter degrading infrastructures and to rejuvenate the area, the local government launched a project of regeneration at the end of the century. A project began in 1998 to conserve and restore the historic buildings and turn them into museums, galleries, cafes or craft shops. In the project the local infrastructure was upgraded and new cultural elements such as street sculptures were added to the new pedestrian street. The sites of important historical events and residences of prominent historical people would be made more accessible and open to the public. A museum of modern art (Duolun MOMA) was also part of the project. Pedestrianisation was completed in 1999.

Colella grew up in New York and was a high school football star in his hometown of Albion. He played four years of college football at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York before being drafted by the NFL's Detroit Lions. He was on the Lions' roster for two years, after which he moved to the Rams in 1945 and the Browns of the AAFC in 1946. Colella stayed with the Browns for three years, in each of which the team won the AAFC championship. He spent the 1949 season with the Buffalo Bills before leaving football. High school and college career Colella grew up in Albion, New York, and played three sports at the city's Charles D'Amico High School. Was referenced as \\"The Albion Antelope.\\" After graduating, he attended Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, where he was a versatile football player for four years. He was a running back, quarterback, defensive back, kicker and kick-return man at the school, and won Little All-America honors three years in a row. He returned a kickoff for a touchdown and kicked two extra points in a Canisius Golden Griffins win over the then-undefeated Long Island Blackbirds in 1940. Professional career Collella was drafted by the National Football League's Detroit Lions in 1942, and played two seasons for the team. The Cleveland Rams acquired him in 1944. He played as a halfback and punter for the Rams, who won the NFL championship in 1945. The Cleveland Browns, a new team under formation in the All-America Football Conference, signed Colella soon after the 1945 season ended. He was among five players who joined the Browns when the Rams moved to Los Angeles before the 1946 season; the others were Chet Adams, Don Greenwood, Mike Scarry and Gaylon Smith. With the Browns, Colella was a punter and defensive halfback between 1946 and 1948. Colella had 10 interceptions in 1946, leading the AAFC. Cleveland coach Paul Brown said in 1948 that Colella provided \\"the type of punt we want against such dangerous receivers as the Rockets and Buffalo Bills have. All of his kicks have gone out of bounds, and our opponents have gained exactly no yards on returns in the last two games.\\" Cleveland won the AAFC championship in each of the three seasons he was with the team. Colella was traded to the Buffalo Bills in May 1949 along with Chet Adams, his former Rams teammate. \\"We have won three championships, but we can't remain at a standstill,\\" Brown said. He played one season for the Bills before leaving football. Later life and death In the 1950s, Colella stayed in Buffalo and worked as a salesman. Colella was inducted into the Canisius College Athletics Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class in 1963.

History The inhabitants of Tripoli began sporting activities, with football at the top of their list of popular activities, which they played in their local arenas and stadia. The popularity of football among the public, among other sports, meant they founded a youth club to compete more seriously (on a national level) in sports like boxing, where they won many national championships. Attersana was founded in 1954, with efforts from the youth of Souq Aljum'aa, on the east side of Tripoli, who decided they needed a club to combine their sporting talents, and also meet socially. The club was initially founded under the name Alhilal Tripoli, the first club in the area. They competed in many championships, most of which were Tripoli Championships. In the 1970s, the two clubs (Alhilal Tripoli & Attersana) were prevented the permission to merge, so the club changed its name to Al Tarsana Sports, Social & Cultural Club However, some of the club's most important achievements have not been in football. Volleyball is the club's most successful sport. They participated in the 1978 Arab Club Volleyball Championship. They were the best volleyball club in Libya in the 1970s, and represented the Jamahiriya in the Volleyball World Club Cup, the country's biggest achievement to date. Recent years The club's first season in the Libyan Premier League was in 2002‚Äì03, where the club finished in 10th place. They did not fare as well in their second season, finishing in bottom place, with just two wins all season. The club's first season in the Libyan Second Division was a disaster, as they finished bottom of the table, with just 12 points from 14 matches, and therefore, they were relegated to the Libyan Third Division. They were, however, re-instated, and finished 4th in Group A, just three points off the Relegation/Promotion Play Off places. In 2006‚Äì07, Tersana's third season at the second level, they were given a very favourable draw in Group A. Their only rivals for a promotion place were Wefaq and Wahda. They finished 2nd, qualifying for the Final Stage, where they were drawn with Al Najma and Urouba. They achieved 5 points from their four matches, a 1‚Äì0 win over Al Najma securing promotion to the top flight. Their first season back in the top flight was a struggle, as Tersana fought it out all season with Al Wahda and Tahaddi to avoid the Promotion/Relegation Play Off place. They were tied with the two clubs on 33 points at the end of the season, and their head-to-head record helped them avoid the drop. Players like Gozauber, Ouli Haujes, Ezeddin al Misraty and Samir Al Wahaj undeniably helped the club avoid the drop. Gozauber, Hajues and Al Wahaj scored 14 goals between them, Haujes earning a move to Al Akhdar. Tunisian manager Lutfi Sellami guided the team to a respectable 7th-place finish, thanks to the 19 goals of on-loan forward Samir al Wahaj, as well as a place in the Libyan Cup final in 2008‚Äì09, where they were unfortunately defeated on penalties by Ittihad. However, after a poor start in the league the following season, he was sacked, and ex-midfielder Ali al Marjeani took over. Tersanah gained qualification to the 2010 CAF Confederation Cup, where they were drawn with Algerian outfit CR Belouizdad. After a dramatic late equaliser in the first leg, the Sky Blues took the lead in Mohamed Belouizdad, before the Algerians roused themselves to a comeback, and a 3‚Äì2 victory on aggregate. After a poor showing in the first half of the season, where The Arsenal found themselves hovering dangerously close to the drop zone, Al Marjeani managed to steer the side clear, focusing on youth. Top flight status was secured with an impressive 5‚Äì1 win over champions Ittihad, braces from Anees Zaghab and Zachory Herman, as well as a goal from Anees al Idrissy securing a rare win over their cross-city neighbours. The 2009‚Äì10 season was capped with the opening of the Tersanah Sporting Complex, which includes a new artificial-grass pitch stadium, opened on May 30, 2010. A full house was present in the Souq al Jum'aa area of Tripoli, as LFF president Muhammad Gaddafi commended the club on their achievements, and opened the complex. The heroes of the 1978 Volleyball team were also remembered and congratulated.

It gets its name from the inventor, Latino Orsini. The radio latino can be considered a kind of geometric square.Daumas, Maurice, Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers, Portman Books, London 1989 It was a general purpose instrument that could be used for a variety of angular measurements as well as depth and inside dimension measures. Usage Drawing of a radio latino. The red lines represent viewing angles from the outermost components and the green lines are viewing angles from the end to the outer points on the frame. The diagram leaves out the handle on the free end of the main rod. The slider (blue in the adjacent diagram) could move along the central rod, causing the deltoid formed by four other rods to change shape symmetrically. The end points of the rods had sights on them, allowing various sight lines to be defined. The central rod was graduated with various scales. These scales allowed the angles between the end rods (represented by the red lines in the diagram) to be determined as well as the angle with its vertex at one end of the main rod and sides (represented by the green lines in the diagram) through the outer joints of the rods. With different graduations, one could determine or lay out: *angles between sight lines with a degree scale. *internal angles of regular polygons with polygon scales. *internal diameters and dimensions (such as the inside bore of a cannon) using the distance between the outer joints (represented by the grey dimension lines in the diagram) using a length scale. *gun elevations for cannon. *heights of objects by measuring angles. *shadow square calculations. *depths from the free end of the main rod to the slider. When folded, the radio latino would resemble a sword and was stored in a sheath or scabbard. Construction The radio latino was usually constructed of brass. The central, main rod was graduated with multiple scales. The free end of the main rod had a handle attached. Within the handle, a small compass was mounted. The two end-most side rods were shorter than the two attached to the slider. This permitted the end rods to be set to any angle up to 180¬∞. The slider could move along the main rod and was used as an index for reading the engraved scales. Each hinged vertex had a sighting vane. This permitted the instrument to be used to measure or lay out angles or other dimensions visually.

The film focuses on a group of college freshmen and their experiences as summer camp counselors at the fictional Camp Bleeding Dove. The film is collectively narrated by each of the subjective counselors. It marks Waters' directorial debut, as well as the film debut of Jaime King. The film was screened at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival, and was later released straight-to-DVD on June 18, 2002. Plot When the rule-enforcing camp director at Camp Bleeding Dove gets struck by lightning, the counselors find themselves in sole charge of their campers, and themselves. Among them are the brooding and intellectual Wichita; Wendy, who is guileless and unabashedly religious; Talia, an outcast and former college friend of Wichita's; Pixel, a waifish hippie who bathes in the camp lake; Jasper, an openly gay man; the brutish Adam; and Donald, a nerdy and unconfident virgin. Wichita, who initially finds himself repulsed by Wendy who is his polar opposite, begins to find himself attracted to her, and the two begin to court one another while the rest of the campers and counselors look on. An atheist, Wichita begins to question his belief in God after he finds a photo of himself as a child in the background of one of Wendy's family photos at Mount Rushmore; however, he does not tell her about it. The two eventually admit their feelings for one another, and Wendy loses her virginity to Wichita after having an allergic reaction to a bee sting. Meanwhile, Talia, who has feelings for Wichita, becomes disillusioned after he admits he simply wants to be friends; she later finds he and Wendy have become physically involved. Donald, urged by the rest of the counselors, attempts to court Talia, but she is resistant. Wendy, in order to test the legitimacy of Wichita's feelings for her, has Pixel attempt to seduce him in the woods. Wichita, who overheard their plan, kisses Pixel in front of her, and Wendy leaves in tears, believing he failed the test. On the penultimate day of camp, Wichita confesses to Wendy that he had purposely failed she and Pixels' test; the same day in the woods, Adam confronts Pixel over their sexual relationship, and she rejects him, saying that their relationship was just a fling for her. At the camp mess hall, Donald and Talia incite a riot with the campers, and they all run into the woods in body paint and attack Adam, Pixel, Wichita, and Wendy with condoms fashioned into water balloons. The next day, as Wendy and Pixel prepare to leave, Wendy notices that half of her family photo from Mount Rushmore has been torn off, which Wichita had taken and eaten to dispose of. As the campers and counselors prepare to leave, the children confess how much they meant to them. On the bus ride back, Wendy is forced to sit next to Wichita. Donald takes a photo of them with a camper in-between, asking them to smile for the photo, which appears on the cover of the following year's camp staff manual.

However, it did not receive a theatrical release; instead, it was released straight-to- DVD on June 18, 2002, by New Line Home Entertainment. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 57% based on reviews from 7 critics. Jeffrey Anderson of Combustible Celluloid gave the film a positive review, writing: \\"This hilarious little gem from Daniel Waters, the screenwriter of Heathers, went straight to video because the distributor couldn't figure out exactly what to do with it. In this vicious, odd summer camp story, everyone wants to be like cool counselor Brad Renfro, every imaginable disaster comes to light, and the gorgeous James (Jaime) King frolics half-naked by the lakeside. Before long, this will be a cult favorite and people will be quoting lines at parties. Don't miss it.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote: \\"Few films have tapped into teenspeak as adroitly as Heathers did. But that was 12 years ago, and while that film's writer, Daniel Waters, still is preoccupied with teen sex and the social pecking order, he indulges his obsession with much less finesse in his scattershot directorial debut.\\" McCarthy called it a \\"sporadically funny, far too self-consciously irreverent summer camp send-up\\". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called the film a \\"cross between Wet Hot [American Summer] and A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and deemed it \\"a worthy followup to [Waters'] Heathers.\\" References External links Happy Campers screenplay, early draft (1998) * \\"Cabin Fever\\", photographs from the set of Happy Campers (Spin, June 2000) Category:2001 films Category:2001 black comedy films Category:2001 directorial debut films Category:2001 independent films Category:2001 LGBT-related films Category:2000s coming-of-age comedy films Category:2000s teen comedy films Category:American black comedy films Category:American coming-of-age comedy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American teen comedy films Category:American teen LGBT-related films Category:English-language films Category:Films about summer camps Category:Films produced by Denise Di Novi Category:Films scored by Rolfe Kent Category:Films set in forests Category:Films set in North Carolina Category:Films shot in North Carolina Category:LGBT-related comedy films ","title":"Happy Campers (film)"},{"id":"14062634","text":"MacTalk Australia, is an online forum dedicated to news, support & discussion amongst Apple product users or potential users, with an Australian bias. In 2011 Niche Media purchased the Online Apple Community Forum which formed the new Consumer Tech Division under Niche Media. History =Origins= AppleTalk Australia was founded on 1 January 2004 after two users of Overclockers Australia, Matt \\"Disko\\" Kelsh and Anthony \\"decryption\\" Agius banded together to create an online forum for Australian Apple users. The name was borrowed from Apple's own networking product, AppleTalk. The site was initially run through voluntary labour and donations, before turning to a commercial venture, with advertising assisting in the running costs of the site. =Name Change= In 2006 AppleTalk was rebranded MacTalk Australia. Whilst the site had flown under Apple Inc's radar, using its trademarked name \\"AppleTalk\\", a disgruntled forum member reportedly alerted Apple to the forum's existence, leading to Apple's renowned legal team contacting Agius. As the forum was moving towards becoming a commercial venture, it was time to rebadge itself as MacTalk Australia. =Controversy= Agius published claims that Apple had briefed resellers on the Australian iPhone release and later posted pictures of a box that had been sent to a local reseller, labelled \\"Do Not Open Until 10 June\\". =Awards= From July 2004 to June 2005 AppleTalk Australia was ranked #19 in the Hitwise Australia 'News and Media ‚Äî IT Media' industry based on number of visits, improving to #8 between October and December 2005. =Domain and Name= The site was originally registered at appletalk.ma.cx but was switched to appletalkaustralia.com on 8 January 2004. In late 2006, to avoid any further trademark issues the site was renamed \\"MacTalk Australia\\". =Founder's Exit= In February 2011, Agius put the site up for sale on website auction site Flippa.com. In an interview, he said that \\"after such a significant financial and personal investment I'm walking away with a significant redundancy package\\". In June 2011 Agius sold MacTalk to Niche Media, publishers of Macworld Australia magazine. MacTalk's current publisher is Liana Pappas.

Due to the heavy customisation, an upgrade of the software was fraught with great difficulty and indefinitely put off, but in April 2006 was rebuilt around Invision Power Board version 2.1.4 after the site was hacked. However, due to changes in IPB updates breaking the customised skin, the board was not updated and as a result was hacked once again in October 2006. Rather than rebuild around IPB again, the admins decided to rebuild the skin around vBulletin, this time not using a wrapper, but entirely using the theme engine built in. The adapted skin was built by \\"iSlayer\\" over a week-long period while the forums were down. The old database was migrated and the site brought up again.

He later was an umpire officiating in the American Football League (AFL) for its entire existence, from 1960 through 1969. He officiated in the first AFL championship in 1960 and the first Super Bowl after the 1966 season. Young grew up in a poor family outside of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He was a star athlete in high school, playing on his football team and winning a state heavyweight title in wrestling as a senior. Young attended the University of Georgia and was on the Bulldogs football team in 1941 and 1942, when the school won the Rose Bowl. He then spent three years in the military during World War II and played service football as he trained in the U.S. Navy. He played in 1944 for Paul Brown, then the head football coach at a Naval facility outside Chicago. After the war, Brown became head coach of the Cleveland Browns in the AAFC and signed Young. He played on the defensive line for the Browns until his retirement in 1953, a span during which the team won five league championships. After his playing career, Young worked as an executive at a utility in Illinois and officiated in the AFL. He died of a brain tumor in 1969. Early life and college career Young grew up poor in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Wilkes-Barre. His mother died when he was 10 years old, and dinner often consisted of canned beans or soup. Despite a bad diet, Young grew to six feet, three inches and more than 200 pounds. He played three years as an end on his Forty Fort High School football team and was also a wrestler, winning the state heavyweight title as a senior. The head of a soft drink bottling company in Wilkes-Barre helped Young get into the University of Georgia, where he played football on the varsity team starting as a freshman. He was on a Georgia Bulldogs football team that won the Rose Bowl after the 1942 season. Soon after the game, Young entered the U.S. military as America's involvement in World War II intensified. He was sent as a Navy cadet to Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago and played on a service football team there coached by Paul Brown in 1944. The following year, he was transferred to Fleet City, a complex of Naval bases in California, and played on a Fleet City Bluejackets team that won the service national championship. At Fleet City, doctors discovered Young had a large growth of calcium on his right thigh bone. They wanted to operate and thought it would grow larger, but told Young he would lose significant use of his leg after surgery. He elected not to have the operation and hope for the best. The deposit grew to 9 1/2 inches before it stopped; it did not affect his ability to run. Cleveland Browns After the war, Paul Brown became the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, a professional team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference. He invited Young to try out for the squad. Young barely made the team and played sparingly in the Browns' first season in 1946, when the team won the first AAFC championship. Young almost failed make the roster again in 1947, but thereafter became a stalwart on the Browns' defensive line as a defensive end whose job it was to disrupt opponents' running and passing attacks. The Browns won the following three AAFC championships, helped by a staunch defense and a high-scoring offense featuring quarterback Otto Graham and fullback Marion Motley. Young continued his academic studies during the offseason ‚Äì his career at Georgia was cut short by the war ‚Äì and received a degree from Baldwin‚ÄìWallace College in 1949. The AAFC disbanded after the 1949 season and the Browns were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). Young continued to play for the Browns as the team won the 1950 NFL championship and advanced to the championship but lost in each of the ensuing three years. Young announced his retirement after the 1953 season, when he shared playing time with rookie Doug Atkins at left defensive end. Later life and officiating career Young worked during the off-season in his last two years with the Browns at the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois in its personnel department. He took a full-time job with the utilities company after leaving football and settled in Waukegan, Illinois. \\"I liked the work from what I saw of it the last couple of years and I've decided to devote full time to it now\\", he said. Young came back to professional football in 1960, when he was hired as an official in the new American Football League (AFL). He continued his regular job as an area manager for the utility in Illinois while officiating games part-time. He served as the umpire in the AFL's first championship between the Houston Oilers and the Los Angeles Chargers. In 1966, he was the umpire in Super Bowl I, the first inter-league title game between the champions of the AFL and NFL. Young died suddenly in 1969 of a brain tumor at 45. He was an AFL official for the league's entire existence; the AFL and NFL formally merged starting in the 1970 season.

DIMBOA is a powerful antibiotic present in maize, wheat, and related grasses, DIMBOA was first identified in maize in 1962 as the \\"corn sweet substance\\". Etiolated maize seedlings have a very sweet, almost saccharin-like taste due to their high DIMBOA content. DIMBOA is stored as an inactive precursor, DIMBOA-glucoside, which is activated by glucosidases in response to insect feeding, In maize, DIMBOA functions as natural defense against European corn borer larvae,G7113 European Corn Borer: A Multiple-Crop Pest in Missouri, MU Extension beet armyworms (Spodoptera exigua), corn leaf aphids (Rhopalosiphum maidis), other damaging insect pests, and pathogens, including fungi and bacteria. The exact level of DIMBOA varies between individual plants, but higher concentrations are typically found in young seedlings and the concentration decreases as the plant ages. Natural variation in the Bx1 gene influences the DIMBOA content of maize seedlings. In adult maize plants, the DIMBOA concentration is low, but it is induced rapidly in response to insect feeding. In addition to serving as a direct defensive compound due to its toxicity, DIMBOA can also function as a signaling molecule, leading to the accumulation of callose in response to treatment with chitosan (a fungal elicitor) and aphid feeding. DIMBOA can also form complexes with iron in the rhizosphere and thereby enhance maize iron supply. Specialized insect pests such as the western corn rootworm can detect complexes between DIMBOA and iron and use these complexes for host identification and foraging.

Biography He was born into a family of artists at Bedano, a village 7 km north of the Ticinese capital Lugano. He studied at Parma under a sculptor, and also in the Academy, and became known for his ornamental architectural decorations. In 1770, he travelled to Tuscany to perform with his brother Grato the stucco decoration of the Villa del Poggio Imperiale. He then visited Rome and then Naples, where he briefly worked with Carlo Vanvitelli. In 1774, he returned north to his family in Bedano; soon he met up with Giuseppe Piermarini for whom he collaborated in future stucco decoration of palaces. In 1776 he was elected professor of ornamenti architettonici (architectural ornament) at the newly created Brera Academy in Milan; he held this post for more than a quarter of a century until failing eyesight caused him to resign in 1812. From 1775-1779, Piermarini erected the Royal Villa at Monza, with Albertolli providing the stucco decoration. He also labored in the Palazzo Melzi d'Eril in Milan and designed (1808-1815) the famed lakeside Villa Melzi d'Eril in Bellagio. He rebuilt a Bramantesque chapel in Moncucco, called Shrine of Saint Lucius. He published a number of treatises on his art, including: * Ornamenti Diversi (1782) * Alcune Decorazioni di Nobili Sale (1787) * Miscellanea per i giovanni studioso del disegno (1796) * Corso elementare di ornamenti architettonici (1805) In 1809 Napoleon made him a Knight of the Iron Crown. Albertolli was much employed in decorating palaces, churches, and public buildings in Italy, and gave a new impetus to the art of ornamental design in that country. He worked on designs of altars, candlesticks, chalices, and lamps for churches. His paintings are scarce. A Madonna and Child by him is in the Milanese church of San Rocco. Giocondo Albertolli died in Milan in 1839 at the age of ninety-six. His son, Rafaello was an engraver. Giocondo's nephew, Giacomo Albertolli, was a professor of civil architecture in Padua, later in Milan, where he replaced his teacher, Piermarini.

These first settlers are presumed to have arrived from mesoamerica in Central America, some 10,500 years BC, although there is some evidence of human vestiges that may date to 22,000 years BC. Upon the arrival of the Spanish during the 15th century what is now Antioquia Department was populated by numerous indigenous tribes, especially the Caribs, which according to archaeological findings began to extend their territory through the Caribbean region of the Antioquia Department and then moved south through the Cauca and Magdalena valleys. Not much is known with certainty about the Carib culture because the Spanish considered any indigenous group in the area that used bows and poisoned arrows and practiced cannibalism and sodomy to be Carib. Two groups in the Carib family were predominant in Antioquia Department: the Cat√≠os and the Nutabes that inhabited the region between the Cauca River and Porce River, as well as the Valley of Aburr√°, and the Taham√≠es, who inhabited the region between the Porce River and the Magdalena River. The region of the Gulf of Urab√° was inhabited by Urab√°es and Cunas, who belonged to the Chibchan speaking nations. In previous centuries, a different tribe, the Quimbayas, not related to the Caribs or Chibchas, inhabited certain areas of southern Antioquia Department, in what are now the municipalities of Abejorral and Sons√≥n, but are presumed to have disappeared in the 10th century AD.  Spanish conquest  The first group of Spanish to discover what is now Antioquia Department was headed by Spanish conqueror Rodrigo de Bastidas who entered through the Dari√©n region in 1500. Ten years later the Spanish conqueror Alonso de Ojeda entered with another group of Spanish conquerors and founded the village of San Sebasti√°n de Urab√° which function as a \\"business center\\" for the Spanish, this village was substituted later in duties with the village of Panama because of the constant attacks that received from the indigenous tribes. San Sebastian de Uraba ruins are now located within the municipality of Necocl√≠, Antioquia Department. The first incursions inland by the Spanish in what is now Antioquia did not start until 1536, when Jorge Robledo, Captain and Marshal of the Spanish monarchy organized an expedition by orders of the monarchy in 1541 and went to discover the Valley of Aburr√° and founded the village of Antioquia, but after a few changes was finally settled in 1546 on what is now the village of Santa Fe de Antioquia. The Spanish ignored the terrain and vegetation while the indigenous tribes became their enemies, clashing in numerous battles, after the Spanish attacked them. The territory of present-day Antioquia was baptized as Province of Antioquia and pertained to the Spanish Empire. Its first governorship was created by order of the King of Spain in 1569. In 1675 the settlement of Medell√≠n was proclaimed a village by the then governor of the province of Antioquia, captain general and governor Don Miguel de Aguinaga. The last governor before the Independence from Spain was Don Francisco de Ayala.  Mon y Velarde: Reformer of Antioquia  In 1785 the governor of Antioquia, Francisco Silvestre, demanded the presence of the auditor Juan Antonio Mon y Velarde, due to the crisis the province of Antioquia was going through. While visiting as judge, Mon y Velarde introduced several reforms that were criticized by the general population. Among his reforms were the reorganization of rental income from alcohol and tobacco, a new mining code that substituted the one governor Gaspar de Rodas had expedited in the 16th Century, authorized the use of silver instead of gold for transactions and changed the agrarian structure of Antioquia which allowed the foundation of new villages, he also opposed that large amounts of land were maintained in possession by few individuals that didn't dully exploited them.Biography of Juan Antonio Mon y Velarde  References   External links  *Ra√≠ces paisas, History of Antioquia *Roberto Cadavid Misas, History of Antioquia Category:Paisa Region ","title":"History of the Department of Antioquia"},{"id":"14062778","text":"WFOT 89.5 MHz \\"Annunciation Radio\\" is a Catholic radio station licensed to Lexington, Ohio and serving the Mansfield, Ashland and Mount Vernon areas of the northern Mid-Ohio region airing Catholic programming from EWTN Global Catholic Radio and Ave Maria Radio as a local repeater of originating station WNOC 89.7 MHz licensed in Bowling Green, Ohio with main studios located in Toledo, Ohio and locally serving the southeast corner of the Toledo Diocese and the Catholic parishes of the Ashland, Mansfield and Mount Vernon area WFOT can be heard on a typical car radio along I-71 between Delaware and New London and online Brief history WFOT began in February 2007 as a near-simulcast of WVKO in Columbus from 2007 to 2011 and then WVSG in Columbus from 2011 until July 2013 when it was part of St. Gabriel Radio.

NRE begins with the earliest attractions, may grow into full force when mutuality is established, and can fade over months or years. The term indicates contrast to those feelings aroused in an \\"old\\" or ongoing relationship. The term originated in the Usenet postings of Zhahai Stewart in the 1980s and more widely presented in 1993. This concept is very similar to that of limerence, which was first defined in 1979. While the dynamics described by NRE apply to all relationships, the term is particularly prevalent in the polyamorous community, as people with multiple concurrent intimate relationships experience new relationship energy alongside more settled ongoing relationships. Adjusting to and compensating for the contrast in effect and excitement between the new and old relationships is considered an important factor in successfully balancing those relationships. Describing the process in a positive way can help old partners deal with feelings of jealousy towards the new partner, as well as helping the person with a new partner be more understanding and conscious of maintaining their existing relationships. New relationship energy is generally considered desirable, perhaps nearly indispensable in forming deep emotional bonds, but it can also temporarily distort perceptions and judgements and this must be taken into account.Why We Love: The Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love By Helen Fisher, PhD; Henry Holt: February 2004; These distortions of perception do not automatically imply that the attraction is unreal or will not last (indeed most lasting romantic bonds do begin with NRE, although this does not mean that most relationships that begin with NRE would lead to lasting romantic bonds because of the complications that can come with the end of NRE), only that the magnitude of these positive feelings is greater than it is likely to be later, and some potential interpersonal problems may seem smaller than they will later become. Caution rather than avoidance or suppression is usually suggested in dealing with NRE.Fox, R. Affirmative Psychotherapy With Bisexual Women And Bisexual Men. Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press, 2006 A less-common variant is new relationship chemistry, which is conceptually similar to NRE except with emphasis explicitly limited to the brain chemistry involved in creating the euphoric feelings, rather than actions and rationalized feelings involved with NRE.

Around a quarter of the way through the game, the player acquires the gravity gun, properly named as the \\"Zero-point Energy Field Manipulator\\". Alyx Vance explains that the gravity gun is designed for handling hazardous materials, but is mostly used for heavy lifting. She explains to Gordon that she once found it useful \\"for clearing minefields\\". The gravity gun significantly increases the player's ability to manipulate objects in the game. Like most other weapons in the game, the gravity gun has two trigger functions. The primary trigger causes the gun to emit a small discharge which emits energy to the targeted object. The distance which the object is forced is dependent on its weight and distance from the gun. The secondary trigger attracts the targeted object to the gun and holds it in midair a few inches away, negating its weight and allowing the player to carry it with them. Using the secondary trigger again will drop the item, while the primary trigger will launch it with considerable force. By combining these functions, players can use the gravity gun to scale barriers and obstacles, create cover against enemy characters, or launch the objects at enemy characters, causing them considerable damage. Certain types of objects, such as saw blades, fuel barrels and hydrogen tanks are intentionally designed by Valve to be used as \\"gravity gun ammunition\\". The gravity gun, however, cannot manipulate heavier objects and enemy characters until the late stages of the game, when the device becomes temporarily infused with dark energy meant to destroy it. The gravity gun was very well received by critics, who considered it one of the defining features of Half-Life 2s entertainment value. Planet Half-Life called the gravity gun \\"the next level in interactive gaming.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly described Half-Life 2s gravity gun as the \\"thinking man's death tool,\\" which lets players \\"toy with gravity to kill foes with everyday objects.\\" Call of Duty series military adviser Hank Keirsey stated that \\"the weapon is not very practical\\". He did, however, discuss its historical precedents, further stating that \\"The ancients learned very early how to use gravity to their advantage ‚Äî but this usually involved rolling rocks down hills or pouring boiling oil down the castle walls. Those that failed to respect gravity suffered.\\"Electronic Gaming Monthly features seven notable video game weapons and for each of them divides the profiles into sections headed as \\"The Gun,\\" \\"Keirsey says...Practicality,\\" \\"Historical precedents,\\" and \\"Lethality level.\\" See Evan Shamoon, \\"Gun Show: A real military expert takes aim at videogame weaponry to reveal the good, the bad, and the just plain silly,\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly 230 (July 2008): 49.  Influence on later games  = Half- Life: Alyx = Valve's 2020 virtual reality game Half-Life: Alyx is set as a prequel to Half-Life 2. The player controls Alyx Vance who during the events of the game gains a pair of \\"gravity gloves\\", which provide function similar to the gravity gun with the ability to lift and throw objects, though tailored to work as standard VR in-game hand controls. = TimeSplitters: Future Perfect Temporal Uplink = It was not until the third installment of the TimeSplitters franchise, TimeSplitters: Future Perfect, that the Temporal Uplink was given the ability to manipulate the physics in the game. In Future Perfect, the Temporal Uplink played a much larger role than that of its previous, map and mini-game oriented functionality, which the device was originally used for in TimeSplitters 2. Worn on the wrist of the main player character Sergeant Cortez, the uplink provides a map and the ability to pick up and throw objects, as well as the capability to activate switches remotely. Its grabbing abilities range from picking up weapons and ammo for use by the player in addition to launching objects from a distance at foes. This makes it an especially useful weapon for dispatching larger groups of enemies in the event that the player comes across one of the many explosive barrels placed throughout maps in the campaign mode of the game. = Doom 3 grabber = alt=A nondescript figure stands in the foreground, holding a gun which is emitting a rope-esque beam of light which appears to be manipulating the matter around it. Although Half-Life 2 and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect were the first games released to feature a gravity gun (the former released on November 16, 2004 and the latter released on March 21, 2005), id Software had previously conceived a similar idea during the development of the earlier title Doom 3. id Software designer Matt Hooper noted that \\"we actually used it as a tool throughout development where we'd grab physics objects and place them around the world\\". The tool was used to create \\"damaged\\" rooms in Doom 3; instead of constructing a ruined room, the designers would code a pristine room and use the device to \\"damage\\" it realistically. Although used to assist the development of Doom 3, the gravity gun was not implemented in the final game. Hooper explained that \\"we talked about that quite a few times, but we had such a big arsenal of weapons, and so many other cool things going on, that it was just one of those things that never made it in\\". However, Nerve Software revived the code for the weapon five months after the release of Half-Life 2 in Doom 3s expansion pack, Resurrection of Evil. The device is noted in the Doom 3 storyline as an \\"ionized plasma levitator\\", created by the Union Aerospace Corporation for moving hazardous materials and a forerunner to tractor beams. Usually referred to as the \\"grabber\\", the player obtains the device early on in the course of Resurrection of Evil. The grabber operates differently from Half-Life 2s gravity gun, using only a single trigger function. Once the grabber is aimed at an appropriate object, it locks on, allowing the player to lift the object with the trigger. When the player releases the trigger, the object will be propelled forward with force, turning it into an impromptu weapon. One key ability of the grabber is its capacity to lock on to the fireball projectiles cast by some hostile non-player characters, allowing players to turn the attack against their foe. However, unlike the gravity gun in Half-Life 2, the grabber cannot hold objects for as long as the player wishes; if they wait too long to launch the object, the grabber will start to overload and disengage, dropping the object gently on the ground. Critics often compared the grabber directly with Half-Life 2s gravity gun, some noting that the device was far more combat-focused in operation than the gravity gun; in particular, the ability to turn projectiles cast by enemies against them was praised. However, the grabber was considered somewhat \\"awkward\\" to use, requiring a \\"finesse\\" that \\"is rarely something the player has time for in a close-quarters situation\\". = Others = Various other video games have included gameplay features that allow players to use the game's physics to their advantage in combat. In some cases, these are manifested as weapons or devices. For instance, Portal (also created by Valve) features the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device which displays a limited capacity to move objects around the game world, while Crytek's Crysis allows the player to throw objects and enemy characters considerable distances through the use of an experimental nanosuit. In other games, however, it can be represented in a different manner: *In Arkane Studios' Dark Messiah of Might and Magic a psychokinesis spell allows for similar functions as Half- Life 2s gravity gun. *Destroy All Humans! portrayed a similar gravity usage, known as PK. *2K Games's BioShock displays the concept as a telekinesis plasmid. *In EA's third-person horror shooter Dead Space, the player character acquires a 'Kinesis' module, which allows the player to grab and throw objects. *in the Open Arena mod Powerball, there is a weapon called gravity mine launcher, a modified version of the grenade launcher that release gravity mines, that attract to them any too close player. *In Garry's Mod, one of the items is a gravity gun directly imported from Half-Life 2. It also includes a Physics Gun, a modified gravity gun which can position items and limbs as well as freeze them. *In Subnautica, there is a weapon called the Propulsion Cannon that the developers jokingly called the Gravity Gun, allowing people to drag things closer and throw them great distances. *In Space Station 13, crew members can research and then build the One-point Bluespace-Gravitational Manipulator, which has three modes, repulse, which throws everything in an area away, attract, which does the opposite, and chaos, which does both settings, randomly.  Reception  On IGN's list of top 100 weapons which originated in video games, the gravity gun was ranked #5. On GamesRadar's list of top 100 weapons in video games, the gravity gun was ranked #2 just behind the Cerebral Bore from Turok 2.

The book is known for predicting the future of China, and is written by Li Chunfeng and Yuan Tiangang (Ë¢ÅÂ§©ÁΩ°), and has been compared to the works of famous western prophet Nostradamus.Miles, James A. R. [1996] (1996). Legacy of Tiananmen: China in Disarray. University of Michigan. Well known in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, the book was previously banned in the People's Republic of China under the Communist party for superstition (one of the ‚ÄúFour Olds‚Äù), though it has since reappeared in street-side book stalls in the 1990s as a bestseller. Description The book is supposed to contain clues to China's future conveyed through a series of 60 surreal drawings, each accompanied by an equally obscure poem. The title means \\"Back-Pushing Sketch\\" and comes from the last illustration. Each poem is a prophecy, which describes a Chinese historical event that will occur in order. For example, the 36th poem should occur before the 40th poem. Poem number 60 is the last prophecy.

(2002) although he may actually have practised an even more austere style than his predecessors in the gharana.Allyn Miner, Sitar and Sarod in the 18th and 19th Century, 1993 He eschewed much of the ornamentation of modern sitar technique (such as murki and zamzama), and embraced a clean, pure sound. His alap was constructed along the lines of a dhrupad alap, and his jod and jhala derived a lot from rudra vina technique. Oddly enough, in spite of being a musical descendant of Masit Sen, he rarely played Masitkhani gats in public, and none of the commercially available examples of his music includes one. He opted to play the faster Rezakhani gats instead, feeling that playing Masitkhani gats to an undiscerning audience would cause them to be devalued.Gerry Farrell The Senia Style of Sitar Playing in Contemporary India, British Journal of Ethnomusicology, Vol. 11, No. 2. (2002) At first a court musician at Jaunpur, Mushtaq Ali left the court to pursue an independent career. He started playing for All India Radio in 1929, and performed at the 1931 Sangeet Sammelan (music conference) in Allahabad. For all of the 1940s and most of the 1950s he was considered the most prominent sitar player in India, following the demise of Enayat Khan of the Etawah Gharana, and prior to the rise of the young Nikhil Banerjee, Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan in the mid-1950s.Gerry Farrell The Senia Style of Sitar Playing in Contemporary India, British Journal of Ethnomusicology, Vol. 11, No. 2. (2002) In 1968 he won the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest Indian recognition given to practising artists, given by Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance and Drama. Being a purist, Khan-Saheb refused to yield to shifting popular tastes and to adopt the innovations introduced by Ravi Shankar on one hand and Vilayat Khan on the other, which led to a gradual decline in his popularity.Gerry Farrell The Senia Style of Sitar Playing in Contemporary India, British Journal of Ethnomusicology, Vol. 11, No. 2. (2002) At the time of his death he was known as a \\"musicians' musician\\". Many of India's best known musicians expressed their appreciation of the purity of his style and musicality in a book published in Delhi after his deathDebu Chaudhuri (ed) Indian Music and Ustad Mushtaq Ali Khan, 1993  Instruments  Mushtaq Ali Khan belonged to the Senia Gharana. He was the only surbahar player of India who used to play the been-ang with three mizrabs and that too, with the pakhawaj as an accompanying instrument only in pure dhrupad style. In a rare exclusive interview in the Daily Telegraph on 13 July 1985, Khan Sahab narrated the history of this instrument with historical references in which he has cleared the myth of this instrument. Khan Sahab had his lineage with fifth vani, called Dhandvani named after one of the forefathers. The famous dhrupadiya of Shah Jahans Court, Nayak Dhundhu. It is also called Rasal Vani for its beauty. He said, \\"... two of my ancestors, Jaggu Khan and Makku Khan. Since Makku Khan was childless, he adopted Waras Ali Khan a great name who learnt the art of playing Been from Bade Mohammed Khan. When my father Ashiq Ali Khan was six years old, my grand father Sadaq Ali Khan, son of Jaggu Khan died so his uncle Waras Ali Khan taught him all intricacies of Beena on the surbahar. That is why we play Surbahar with three Mezrabs. The Surbahar was originally designed to felicitate the playing of Alap. Those days Alap was the exclusive prerogative of the Beenkar. Ghulam Muhammed Khan and his son Sajjad Mohammed Khan the great SurBahar players used to stay at Calcutta in the earliest part of the 20th century and taught many renowned players, including Imdad Khan and Jnanoda Mukherjee. In this instrument two angas played are alap and talparan and that is why the knowledge of pakhawaj is essential to play the Talparan ...\\".  Awards  Mushtaq Ali Khan was awarded the Sangeet Natak Academy award in 1968 (equivalent to a National Academy Award). In 1973/74 he received the title of D.Litt from Rabindra Bharati University. The Indian government appointed him as the Professor Emeritus in Education and the Cultural Ministry and gave fellowship. Some of the other musical awards were Sitar Sudhakar ‚Äì 1932, Tantri Vilas ‚Äì 1973, Sangeet Ratnakar ‚Äì 1974, State Academy Award ‚Äì 1974, Senior fellowship and Emeritus ‚Äì 1986, Bhuwalka Award ‚Äì 1987, Tansen Award ‚Äì 1987, Special Honour University of Delhi ‚Äì 1987.  Students  He taught many students including Debu Chaudhuri, who has started a cultural Centre in New Delhi under the name of \\"UMAK (acronym of Ustad Mushtaq Ali Khan) Centre for Culture\\", with a view to having Mushtaq Ali's music and his ideas alive. His only surbahar student Steven Landsberg lives and teaches in the United States. Mushtaq Ali Khan taught him the technique of three mizrabs and their unique application in tar paran.  Khan's (late) activities  A follower of rasal vani, Khan Sahab was the only surbahar player who maintained the purity of the rasal vani. In 1953 he had a surbahar recital in Raga Puriya, in the First National Programme of the All India Radio New Delhi. It may be recalled that in the year 1953 Pandit Ravi Shankar was instrumental of instituting this National Programme of All India Radio and was present on this memorable occasion. Mushtag Ali organised conferences where old masters and new artists were introduced to the cognoscenti and the novice. Among the well known names, Ravi Shankar was first presented by him to the public in Calcutta. The Ustad was popular during the early 1930s to the late 1940s. Mushtaq Ali died on 21 July 1989.

In the run-up of the 2006 general election Francesco Rutelli, leader of Democracy is Freedom ‚Äì The Daisy, recruited some devout Catholics, notably Paola Binetti (president of the committee against the referendum on limiting the restrictions to artificial insemination) and Luigi Bobba (leader of the \\"Christian Associations of Italian Workers\\", a leading Catholic association), to run in party lists for the Senate, in order to balance the choice of a joint-list with the left-wing Democrats of the Left for the Chamber of Deputies. In the 2006‚Äì2008 parliamentary term three senators (Luigi Bobba, Patrizia Binetti and Emanuela Baio Dossi) and three deputies (Dorina Bianchi, Enzo Carra and Marco Calgaro) were affiliated to the Theo-Dems. Due to the razor-thin majority of The Union in the Senate, they sometimes held the balance. After some initial criticism, they decided to follow Rutelli into the Democratic Party, born with the merger of Democracy is Freedom with the Democrats of the Left. During the parliamentary term Theo-Dems were joined by other Catholic MPs close to Rutelli, including two former leading members of the Association of Italian Catholic Guides and Scouts, Cristina De Luca and Luigi Lusi. In the current parliamentary term, started with the 2008 general election, the group was originally composed of five deputies (Paola Binetti, Luigi Bobba, Enzo Carra, Marco Calgaro and Donato Mosella) e six senators (Benedetto Adragna, Emanuela Baio Dossi, Egidio Banti, Dorina Bianchi, Luigi Lusi e Antonino Papania),http://www.teodem.it/teodem/?content=docuteodem all close to Rutelli so that they are considered to be part of the so-called rutelliani. In October 2008 some Theo-Dems, along with other Catholic MPs close to Rutelli, notably including Renzo Lusetti, launched a new association named Persons and Networks (PeR). It is not yet clear if it will replace the current association or not. In the 2009 Democratic Party leadership election the group supported Dario Franceschini, through the adhesion to Rutelli's Free Democrats. In October, however, Binetti, offended by some remarks by Franceschini over her positions on homophobia, she hinted that she was going to vote for Pier Luigi Bersani. In November 2009 some Theo-Dems (including Marco Calgaro) left the PD in order to join Rutelli's new party, Alliance for Italy, while in January‚ÄìFebruary 2010 Enzo Carra, Renzo Lusetti and finally Paola Binetti joined the Union of the Centre instead, citing the PD's endorsement to Emma Bonino, a secularist Radical, as centre-left candidate in the Lazio regional election. After these splits, the Theo-Dems, led by Luigi Bobba, are thus a tiny minority within the PD, composed of one deputy and five senators.

They used the names, Seventh Avenue and Blaik, before adopting Small Mercies in 2004. Their final line-up was Steve Blaik on lead vocals and guitar, Marty O'Brien on drums, Danny Procopis on lead guitar, and Jeff Reeves on bass guitar. Small Mercies released two EPs, Is This Life? (2003) and Off the Record (2004), and one studio album, Beautiful Hum (May 2008). Their highest charting release, \\"Innocent\\" (May 2007), reached the ARIA Singles Chart Top 40 and was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 for Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single. By December 2010 the group had disbanded. History =Formation and early EPs= Small Mercies were established in 1997 in Brisbane by Steve Blaik (a.k.a. Steve Martin) on lead vocals (later on guitar), Marty O'Brien on drums, and Danny Procopis on lead guitar ‚Äì all attended local secondary schools, St. Laurence's College (Blaik) and Padua College (O'Brien and Procopis). The trio were initially named Psybin Trip before changing to Blaik (styled as blaik). By 1999 the band were renamed Seventh Avenue and also included Simon O'Connor on rhythm guitar and Shaun Spooner on bass guitar and backing vocals ‚Äì both also from Padua College and both were ex-Nobenn, another Brisbane group. During 2001 Seventh Avenue were finalists for the Brisbane Rock Award, which earned them the right to play at Queen Street Mall Basement. This performance attracted Shawthing Entertainment's Greg Shaw, who became their manager. The band worked with Stuart Stuart (The Veronicas), Dave Nicholas (INXS, Sting), Trey Bruce (Faith Hill) and Randy Staub (Nickelback, Metallica) on song writing or recordings. They met John Woodruff (Savage Garden, Evermore), after he had heard their early demos, who became their next manager in 2001. He recommended them to Sony BMG. In 2002 the band's name returned to Blaik, they released material on their official website, such as a four-track, Blaik Sampler (December 2002), which includes an early version of \\"Innocent\\". In June 2003 they recorded with Bruce producing at Rockinghorse Studios, Byron Bay. Blaik released a five- track EP, Is This Life?, in November that year.

Are you still looking for a producer?\\" Wallace was at the top of their \\"wish list\\" of possible producers. The group recorded their debut album, Beautiful Hum (May 2008), over an eight-week span in late 2006 in Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley, working at The Pass and Sound City Studios. The recording was mixed by Tim Palmer, who had worked with Pearl Jam and U2. The album was released on 24 May 2008, which reached the top 60 of the ARIA Albums Chart. The first single from the album, \\"Innocent\\", was released on 28 May 2007, which reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 40. The track was co-written by Blaik, Procopis and Stuart.

Through the rest of 2008 they toured Australia to promote the album. By December 2010 Small Mercies had disbanded. In June 2014 Blaik performed as a solo artist after having been in a duo, the Associates, with Stuart McLean. Musical styles and influences Small Mercies and their antecedents' music was influenced by numerous artists. In January 2001 Blaik described 7th Avenue's connections, \\"bands like Live, Counting Crows and Pearl Jam so it‚Äôs not too heavy... We mainly play covers at gigs but we add our own flavour as well. It‚Äôs a change that keeps us interested and our influence comes through in the music.\\" He identified his favourite albums: August and Everything After by Counting Crows, Live's Throwing Copper, and The Joshua Tree by U2. Blaik summarised that he \\"loves great storytellers\\". As blaik, the band, in June 2003 their website wrote that their sound was \\"emotional folk pop\\". Blaik, the vocalist, described recording Off the Record as \\"five guys in a room playing rock music... hoping that the music strikes a chord with those who listen to it.\\" It showed the influences of U2, Counting Crows, Aerosmith and Pearl Jam. Jacqui Curtis of The Program felt the EP \\"offers listeners yet another melodic rock band with ever-so-catchy tunes to add to their rotation of summer jams... [which] delivers five delectable rock tracks.\\" Curtis described how \\"Pellet Gun\\", the lead single \\"couples hard-hitting lyrics and memorable guitar riff... and attacks every listener's past loves with an attitude and vindictiveness that the heartbroken, dumped and hard-done-by deserve. Picture yourself burning your ex's clothes and you'll find the essence of 'Pellet Gun'.\\" In an interview on Australian Music Online Blaik listed his favourite Australian artists, and specified some of their attributes or albums: INXS and their lead singer Michael Hutchence's ability \\"to create so much power and emotion\\"; Powderfinger's dedication and uniqueness, and Odyssey Number Five which had \\"everything that I love about Powderfinger\\"; Crowded House especially Neil Finn's song writing capabilities; Silverchair's Diorama which was \\"a journey from beginning to end\\"; The Cruel Sea's live performances; and End of Fashion's self-titled debut album, which he opined \\"represent to us a place that we would want to be in the near future.\\" He also acknowledged AC/DC, especially their Back in Black album, as being highly influential, claiming \\"I don't think I know a single musician who doesn't have this record and this band in their record collection\\", and asking \\"How can you not be inspired by this band?\\" For Beautiful Hum the band provided about 50 tracks and, according to Wallace, there was \\"not a clunker in the bunch.\\" He described Beautiful Hum as somewhat of a \\"best of\\" album, as there was so much content to choose from. Blaik told Tim Colman of The Sydney Morning Herald that \\"There are actually some songs on the record that are four or five years old, they've sort of just evolved as the band's evolved. The songs have progressed to a point where they're really representative of where the band is now.\\" In November 2007 FasterLouder's Melbjuz caught their performance at the Chapel in Melbourne, she felt they provided \\"Emotionally charged melodies... ringing guitar work from Procopis and Blaik‚Äôs charismatic stage persona\\" moving from \\"a real rock-edged buzz\\" with \\"Sorry\\" to \\"a slower, evocative track\\" with \\"Fools\\". American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) reported that critics had found that Small Mercies' \\"sound has elements of Matchbox 20, Maroon 5, Bon Jovi and Nickelback with memorable melodies, along with the heartfelt voice of Steve Blaik and the songs he creates with writing partner, guitarist Danny Procopis.\\" Elisa Scarton of Mediasearch described \\"how distinctly international their sound is\\" on the album, where the \\"sound is fresh, Steve Blaik's vocals are unique and appealing to the ears and the songs fulfill their rock agenda.\\" TheDwarf.com.au website's MikeOwnsYourFace praised \\"Innocent\\" as \\"an epic rock ballad that beckons for lighters and mobile phones to be raised in salutation\\" but noticed that for the album's later tracks \\"The band seems to run out of steam, with most of the songs ending up sounding the same as the last.\\" In an interview in the Cairns community newspaper, Cairns Bulletin, O'Brien described their musical forte: \\"Rock's such a broad term... we do a lot of harder stuff but we also do softer variations\\" and that his fellow members know \\"which buttons to press to make things kick in and when to give space when one needs it.\\"  Members  * Steve Blaik ‚Äì lead vocals, guitar (1997‚Äì2010) * Marty O'Brien ‚Äì drums, percussion (1997‚Äì2010) * Danny Procopis ‚Äì lead guitar (1997‚Äì2010) * Simon O'Connor ‚Äì rhythm guitar (1999‚Äì2004) * Shaun Spooner ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals (1999‚Äì2004) * Jeff Reeves ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals (2005‚Äì2010) Discography =Studio albums= * Beautiful Hum (24 May 2008) AUS ‚Äì No. 54 =Extended plays= * Blaik Sampler (by Blaik) (December 2002) * Is This Life?

If both parties are on an equal footing in a debate, then they will have equal bargaining power, such as in a perfectly competitive market, or between an evenly matched monopoly and monopsony. There are a number of fields where the concept of bargaining power has proven crucial to coherent analysis, including game theory, labour economics, collective bargaining arrangements, diplomatic negotiations, settlement of litigation, the price of insurance, and any negotiation in general. Calculation Several formulations of bargaining power have been devised. A popular one from 1951 and due to American economist Neil W. Chamberlain is: :We may define bargaining power (of A, let us say) as being the cost to B of disagreeing on A's terms relative to the costs of agreeing on A's terms ... Stated in another way, a (relatively) high cost to B of disagreement with A means that A's bargaining power is strong. A (relatively) high cost of agreement means that A's bargaining power is weak. Such statements in themselves, however, reveal nothing of the strength or weakness of A relative to B, since B might similarly possess a strong or weak bargaining power. But if the cost to B of disagreeing on A's terms are greater than the cost of agreeing on A's terms, while the cost to A of disagreeing on B's terms is less than the cost of agreeing on B's terms, then A's bargaining power is greater than that of B. More generally, only if the difference to B between the costs of disagreement and agreement on A's terms is proportionately greater than the difference to A between the costs of disagreement and agreement on B's terms can it be said that A's bargaining power is greater than that of B. In another formulation, bargaining power is expressed as a ratio of a party's ability to influence the other participant, to the costs of not reaching an agreement to that party: :BPA(Bargaining Power of A) = (Benefits and Costs that can be inflicted upon B)/(A's cost of not agreeing) :BPB(Bargaining Power of B) = (Benefits and Costs that can be inflicted upon A)/(B's cost of not agreeing) :If BPA is greater than BPB, then A has greater Bargaining Power than B, and the resulting agreement will tend to favor A. The reverse is expected if B has greater bargaining power instead. These formulations and more complex models with more precisely defined variables are used to predict the probability of observing a certain outcome from a range of outcomes based on the parties' characteristics and behavior before and after the negotiation. One potential application is in patent infringement lawsuits, when the jury must determine for the patent holder and the potential licensee a mutually agreeable royalty for use of the patent holder's proprietary technology. One economist suggests a methodology to calculate the royalty whereby the total surplus of the transaction (or, the gains from trade generated when the patent holder successfully licenses its technology to the licensee) is calculated first, then split among the negotiating parties based on, in part, their relative bargaining power.J. Gregory Sidak, Bargaining Power and Patent Damages, 19 STAN. TECH. L. REV. 1 (2015), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/bargaining- power-and-patent-damages.html. The model explains that a patent holder with more bargaining power‚Äîfor example, a patent holder that licenses its patents on an exclusive basis or that owns a commercially successful technology‚Äîwould capture a larger share of the total surplus than the licensee, and vice versa, as well as shows how that insight could guide a court's determination of a reasonable royalty in a patent infringement lawsuit. Buying power Buying power is a specific type of bargaining power relating to a purchaser and a supplier. For example, a retailer may be able to dictate price to a small supplier if it has a large market share and or can bulk buy. Economic theory In modern economic theory, the bargaining outcome between two parties is often modeled by the Nash Bargaining solution. An example is if party A and party B can collaborate in order to generate a surplus of 100. If the parties fail to reach an agreement, party A gets a payoff X and party B gets a payoff Y. If X+Y<100, reaching an agreement yields a larger total surplus. According to the generalized Nash bargaining solution, party A gets X+œÄ(100-X-Y) and party B gets Y+(1-œÄ)(100-X-Y), where 0 < œÄ < 1\\\\. There are different ways to derive œÄ. For example, Rubinstein (1982) has shown that in a bargaining game with alternating offers, œÄ is close to 1 when party A is much more patient than party B, while œÄ is equal to ¬Ω if both parties are equally patient. In this case, party A's payoff is increasing in œÄ as well as in X, and so both parameters reflect different aspects of party A's power. To clearly distinguish between the two parameters, some authors such as Schmitz (2013) refer to œÄ as party A's bargaining power and to X as party A's bargaining position. A prominent application is the property rights approach to the theory of the firm. In this application, œÄ is often exogenously fixed to ¬Ω, while X and Y are determined by investments of the two parties.

Using the skills learned from biology, engineering, and physics to research and development for health care, such as organs that have been made from artificial materials, or new advances with prosthetic limbs. The creation of biomaterial, which is a fake material that can be integrated into living tissue or can live in sync with biological material, is one of the biggest advances in medicine to this day.

Following his studies at the Rhode Island School of Design and his training at the Gorham Silver Company, he worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1908, he spent time studying wildlife in Wyoming, and then traveled to Africa with Arthur Radclyffe Dugmore to take photographs for Collier's Weekly. On this trip Clark produced the \\"first film to record African wildlife.\\" He brought back specimens for hunters like Theodore Roosevelt and for American museums. He returned regularly to Africa and also traveled to Asia to collect zoological specimens. Clark was a member of the National Sculpture Society, the New York Zoological Society, and the American Geographical Society.  American Museum of Natural History  Footage from the 1926 Morden - Clark Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History Dugmore (left) and Clark (right) on the way to Africa In 1902, director of the American Museum of Natural History Harmon C. Bumpus hired Clark, who was known for his skill in animal sculpture. While working in the employ of John Rowley, Clark sketched animals at the Central Park Zoo and the Bronx Zoo. Bumpus wanted to develop a staff at the AMNH capable of producing the realistic, natural displays that Carl Akeley had created as Chief Taxidermist at the Field Museum from 1896 to 1909. Akeley was considered to be the \\"father of modern taxidermy\\". He was persuaded to mentor Clark and they became lifelong friends as well as colleagues. In 1926, with Carl Akeley's untimely death, Clark took on the leadership role in terms of the AMNH's projects including the construction of the diorama halls, the Vernay Asiatic Hall, the Akeley African Hall, the Birds of the World and Ocean Life halls. He was co-director of the Morden-Clark Asiatic expedition and for a number of years he was with Akeley in Africa. As an expert taxidermist he was responsible for some of the most notable groups that are on display in New York. He was also a sculptor and made some distinguished studies of wild animals. In 1934, eight years after Akeley's death, his influence was still strongly felt at the AMNH, where he was considered to be a diorama expert. Clark, Henry Fairfield Osborn and William R. Leigh were \\"transforming the museum exhibits\\" in the early 1930s. Others included Francis Lee Jaques, Robert Rockwell, Belmore Brown, Carl Rungius, and Hanson Puthuff. In 1966 Clark published the book Good Hunting: Fifty Years of Collecting and Preparing Habitat Groups for the American Museum.  Dugmore-Clark safari  Clark's friend Arthur Radclyffe Dugmore was planning a photo-safari in November 1908 to photograph big game in advance of the President's much-publicized 1909-1910 Smithsonian‚ÄìRoosevelt African Expedition. Clark offered to join Dugmore as his bodyguard, although he had never fired a rifle in his life. The Dugmore-Clark safari overlapped with the former president's safari on several occasions. Dugmore returned to the United States in the late spring of 1909 and Clark stayed on for another six months spending time with Akeley and through him, Roosevelt. Boy Scouts recognition Clark was a former president of the Campfire Club of America and in 1927, the Boy Scouts of America made Clark an Honorary Scout, a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \\"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys ...\\".

Francesco Pesellino (probably 1422‚ÄìJuly 29, 1457), also known as Francesco di Stefano, was an Italian Renaissance painter active in Florence. His father was the painter Stefano di Francesco (died 1427), and his maternal grandfather was the painter Giuliano Pesello (1367‚Äì1446), from whose name the diminutive nickname \\"Pesellino\\" arose. After the death of his father in 1427, the young Pesellino went to live with his grandfather whose pupil he became. Pesellino remained in his grandfather‚Äôs studio until the latter‚Äôs death, when he began to form working partnerships with other artists, such as Zanobi Strozzi and Fra Filippo Lippi. He married in 1442, and probably joined the Florentine painters' guild in 1447. In the following years he made for reputation with small, highly-finished works for domestic interiors, including religious panels for private devotional use and secular subjects for pieces of furniture (i.e. wedding chests and wainscoting). Pesellino died of plague in Florence in 1457 at he age of 35. According to many art historians, his style \\"anticipated the developments of later Florentine painters such as Andrea del Verrocchio and the Pollaiuoli [the brothers Antonio and Piero]\\".Gordon:260 Works According to Vasari, Pesellino painted the predella of Fra Filippo Lippi's Novitiate Altarpiece for Santa Croce. The predella is are now divided between the Uffizi and the Louvre. Pesellino's only surviving documented work is the altarpiece of the Trinity, commissioned in 1455 by the Confraternity of the Priests in Pistoia and now at the National Gallery in London. It was left incomplete on Pesellino's death in 1457 and was finished in 1460 by Filippo Lippi and his workshop, which painted the predella and altar frontal. The main panel, which is about 1.8 meters square, shows the Trinity as the \\"Throne of Mercy,\\" with God the Father supporting the Crucified Christ in his lap. The Trinity is flanked by four standing saints: Mamas, James, Zeno and Jerome. The altarpiece retains four of its original predella panels while the remaining fifth is now at the Hermitage, St Petersburg. The altar frontal, depicting the Virgin of Mercy, was formerly at the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin, and was destroyed in 1945. Griselda (detail of a cassone panel), ca 1450. Bergamo, Accademia Carrara. The commission is unusually well documented. The documents provide a detailed account of the commissioning process and the painting's completion and delivery. They also tell how on Pesellino's death in 1457, his widow began litigation against Pesellino's business partner over the cost of the unfinished work. A number of preparatory drawings for the painting also survive. The altarpiece was later cut up into six parts, probably in the eighteenth century, and has now been reassembled. One missing section (the lower right) is a modern reconstruction.Gordon:260-287 Early sources, such as Vasari's Lives of the Artists, describe a number of other paintings by Pesellino, now lost, in prominent at the Palazzo Medici and the Medici Casa Vecchia. At least one work by Pesellino is said to have hung in the same room as Paolo Uccello's Battle of San Romano. Some panel paintings have been identified as Pesellino's by stylistic comparison with the altarpiece. These include two long horizontal panels with the Story of David and Goliath and the Triumph of David, now at the National Gallery, London.Gordon:288-295 Other cassoni panels are in Bergamo (Accademia Carrara) and Boston (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), whilst the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Toledo Museum of Art have other works. A small diptych of the Annunciation at the Courtauld Institute is another good example of the small-scale cabinet paintings that made Pesellino's famous. The Hermitage has six very beautiful full-page miniatures by Pesellino from an illuminated manuscript.

The bay extends about 6.3 miles (8.5 kilometers) from the southern tip of Diamond Head, the Black Point, also called K≈´pikipiki ª≈ç , in the west to Portlock Point, also known as Kawaihoa Point to the east. On the land side, just to the east of Diamond Head is the upmarket suburb of KƒÅhala. Following are several affluent hillside suburbs like Hawaii Loa Ridge, a gated community that occupies an entire slope. In the east is the suburb of Hawaii Kai, built by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser after World War II. Hawaii Kai has a marina, shopping centers, including a Costco branch, and numerous restaurants such as the well-known Roy's and an offshoot of the Hawaiian brewery Kona Brewing Co.. On the headland leading to Koko Head is the suburb of Portlock, which belongs to Hawaii Kai. The name Maunalua (from Mauna = mountain and [ ªe]lua = two, in the language of the Polynesian natives) refers to the designation of the area around Hawaii Kai in the period of Polynesian settlement. The mountains, located inland from Portlock Point, are the 645 feet (196 meters) high Koko Head, and about 2.2 miles (3.5 kilometers) east thereof, close to Hanauma Bay the Koko Crater, the walls of which rise up to 1,207 feet (368 meters). According to legend, Maunalua was one of the first settlements when the first people of Polynesia settled in Hawai ªi around the 12th century. They originally lived there from fishing and cultivating sweet potatoes. Maunalua Bay Beach Park The beach park was developed by Henry J. Kaiser during the development of Hawaii Kai Marina. Historically, the beach consists of 535,000 square feet (49,703 sq. m) of coral that was dredged and removed, creating a watercraft channel. Kaiser donated it to the City and County of Honolulu in 1960.Maunalua Bay Beach Park, Oahu Public access to the bay is easily made through the city and county beach park off of Kalaniana ªole Highway across from Hawaii Kai Drive.Maunalua Bay Beach Park Oahu Map and Driving Directions Despite the tide height, this bay and reef are always accessible to watercraft, standup paddlers, and snorkelers.

The fort was named for Governor Thomas Pownall, who oversaw its construction. It never saw action, and was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War by the actions of both colonists and the British military to prevent its further use. The fort's remains were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. Setting Fort Point State Park is located at the easternmost tip of Cape Jellison, a triangular peninsula which juts into Penobscot Bay at the mouth of the Penobscot River. The park, established in 1974, includes, in addition to the ruins of Fort Pownall, the Fort Point Light. The cape's eastern tip forms a narrow peninsula, with the fort's ruins on the high ground near its easternmost end. History In 1759, during the French and Indian War, Massachusetts governor Thomas Pownall led the construction of a fort here, which he named Fort Pownall after himself. It was one of three significant forts which the British built on the major rivers in the Northeast to cut off the native water ways to the ocean to prevent attacks on the British settlers (also see Fort Halifax and Fort Frederick (Saint John, New Brunswick)). The fort was intended to secure the area for European settlement by driving off the remaining Norridgewock and Penobscot Indians. The first Commander of the fort was Jedidiah Preble (1759-1763), followed by Col. Thomas Goldthwait (1763-1775). Thomas Goldthwait - was he a Tory. Collections of the Maine Historical society, p. 23 (includes Goldthwaith portrait p. 1) In 1775, British forces seized the cannons and powder. Later, a regiment of Continental Army soldiers burnt the blockhouse and filled in most of the ditches to prevent their use by the British. Description The fort, as built, was roughly on each side, with an octagonal star-shaped earthworks surrounded by a moat or ditch wide and deep. Inside the earthworks was a blockhouse, built out of squared timbers, measuring on each side, and two stories in height. At each corner there was a diamond-shaped projection, where each side was . Because the blockhouse and other wooden elements of the fort were burned, only the earthworks and stone foundations remain.

First published in 1998 by Carroll & Graf, it is the third book in the Anno Dracula series. Plot In 1959, several of the world's notable vampires gather in Rome for the wedding of Count Dracula. Nefarious schemes are afoot and being investigated by British Intelligence, the Diogenes Club, and several others, including a British spy on the trail of a sinister madman with a white cat. Setting The book is an alternate history novel set in a world where Van Helsing never killed Dracula. The version of Rome shown in the book is heavily influenced by Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini. As always in the series, the novel contains a number of characters from other fictional works, though due to copyright restrictions some are not named or are given aliases. Some of these identity shifts are quite clear (such as the character of Commander Hamish Bond, who has a fondness for martinis, drives an Aston Martin, carries a Walther PPK, has the Scots version of the name \\"James\\" for his name, and gets to say \\"the bitch is dead.\\"), while some are more obscure (a Kansas football player named Kent, for example). The novel's original title is inspired by Bruno Martino's song \\"Dracula Cha Cha Cha\\", which appears on the album Italian Graffiti (1960/61?) and is performed onscreen in Vincente Minnelli's film Two Weeks in Another Town (1962).

Nearly 300,000 licensed firearm owners own and use New Zealand's estimated 1.5 million firearms.\\"Kiwis go for the big guns\\", Dominiost, Tuesday 7 November 2006.

(Q3022) and without criminal, psychiatric or drug issues; as well as meeting other conditions such as having suitable storage facilities. Several different categories of licence are permitted, with the most common, \\"A Category\\", permitting access to sporting configuration rifles and shotguns. Tighter regulation was imposed immediately after the Aramoana massacre in 1990, the Scottish Dunblane and Australian Port Arthur massacres in 1996. After the Christchurch mosque shootings in 2019, legislation to restrict semi-automatic firearms and magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds, and provide an amnesty and buyback of such weapons was introduced and passed by the New Zealand parliament 119 - 1.  Current firearms law  Gun laws in New Zealand focus mainly on vetting firearm owners, rather than registering firearms or banning certain types of firearms.From the Arms Code Firearms legislation is provided for in the New Zealand's gun laws: the Arms Act 1983,Arms Act 1983, legislation.govt.nz Arms Amendment Act 1992,Arms Amendment Act 1992, legislation.govt.nz and Arms Regulations 1992Arms Regulations 1992, legislation.govt.nz and associated regulations. About 250,000 people hold a New Zealand firearms licence, although only one in ten own a firearm. =Grounds to carry or use guns= Under New Zealand law, some lawful, proper, and sufficient purpose is needed to use, discharge or carry any firearm, airgun, or similar weapon. The person carrying, using, or discharging the weapon is obliged to prove the purpose was lawful, proper, and sufficient. This requirement applies even if the person can legally possess the weapon. Exactly what constitutes a lawful, proper, and sufficient purpose is not defined in legislation and must be proven on a case by case basis. Hunting game, pest control and agricultural uses, sports, collection, and theatrics are all normally acceptable purposes but personal protection and self-defence are not. The New Zealand firearm licence limits the grounds upon which an individual can carry a gun. The minimum legal age to own a gun is 16, or 18 for a \\"military style semi-automatic firearm.\\" Personal protection of VIPs It is established New Zealand law and public policy that allowing privately owned guns to be carried by people who provide personal protection to VIPs, whether foreign or domestic, is not appropriate. Armed protection, if necessary, should be provided by the New Zealand Police or the New Zealand Defence Forces. The New Zealand Police has a Diplomatic Protection Service (DPS) that trains and provides protection officers to protect VIPs. DPS protection officers, unlike most New Zealand police officers, are routinely armed while on duty. A temporary exception was made for the 1999 APEC Summit, hosted in Auckland. The Arms Act was specifically amended to allow authorised personal protection officers of foreign dignitaries to carry their own firearms. This exception expired on 30 September 1999. Self-defence In the Arms Code, a manual on firearms safety, the New Zealand Police advise that \\"[t]he law does not permit the possession of firearms ‚Äòin anticipation‚Äô that a firearm may need to be used in self-defence.\\" While the Crimes Act 1961 allows a person to use reasonable force to defend oneself or another person against assault or entry into a dwelling house, that force needs to be proportionate to any force being used to effect the assault or entry and not excessive. Preemptive action in anticipation of a threat or retribution after the threat has passed are both considered excessive force by the courts. Even police actions when confronting armed offenders that results in death or injury of anyone are thoroughly investigated by the police, the Independent Police Conduct Authority and, in cases of death, the coroner. There have been a number of cases where a member of the public has been justified in discharging a firearm that injured or killed an assailant. In 2006 a gun shop employee shot a machete-wielding armed robber with a handgun that was hidden under the counter. The court dismissed the charges that police laid. In April 2009, a Chinese restaurant and takeaways shop owner shot a masked armed robber with the robber's own gun after wresting it from him. Police decided against laying charges. Vehicles The driver of a vehicle is deemed to be the person who is in possession of any firearm in that vehicle, unless they can prove otherwise. Firearms cannot be left in unattended vehicles. Firearms carried in vehicles must be unloaded and any magazine must be empty. Unlawful use Possessing a firearm or other weapon that could cause bodily injury or intimidate with the threat or fear of violence is an aggravating factor in criminal offending and can be a criminal offence on its own. Police responses to such behaviour can have potentially lethal consequences as the Police Armed Offenders Squad are trained to shoot to kill, if less lethal options do not resolve a situation. = Categories of firearms prior to 2019 changes = Firearms in New Zealand fell into one of four categories: * Pistols are firearms shorter than 762 mm (30 in). * Restricted weapons include machine guns, selective-fire assault rifles, grenades and rocket launchers. This category also includes some non-firearm weapons such as pepper spray. Cabinet can declare things to be restricted weapons by regulation. * Military-style semi-automatics (MSSAs) include semi-automatic rifles and shotguns that have any of the following components: ** A folding or telescopic butt ** A bayonet lug ** A military pattern free-standing pistol grip ** A flash suppressor ** A magazine that holds more than 7 rounds; magazines holding up to 10 rounds may be modified to carry 7 rounds. The limit on rimfire is 15 rounds per magazine. ** A detachable magazine that holds more than 10 rounds, excepting rimfire magazines, which may carry 15 rounds. * A Category firearms are those that do not fall into any other category, and are the vast majority of legally-owned firearms in New Zealand, and support a surprisingly wide number of types. For example semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles are permitted in this category provided they can only hold 7 or less rounds as well as meeting the other criteria. Registration is not required under the law but the police carry out a regime similar to registration for all but \\"A Category\\" firearms. Firearms in any other category require a \\"permit to procure\\" before they are transferred. = Categories of firearms after changes = * Pistols Were not specifically targeted by changes to legislation and this category remains largely the same.\\"Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019\\" * Restricted weapons include machine guns, selective-fire assault rifles, grenades and rocket launchers. This category also includes some non- firearm weapons such as pepper spray. As of late 2019 all semi auto center- fire rifles and any rifle or rifle magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds now fall into the restricted category, as do box magazine fed shotguns and shotguns with a magazine capacity of over 5 cartridges (both pump-action and semi-auto) . Semi-auto tubular magazine shotguns not holding more than 5 rounds and semi-auto rim-fire rifles not holding more than 10 rounds in a magazine are exempt.\\"Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019\\" Cabinet can declare things to be restricted weapons by regulation. * Military-style semi-automatics As of late 2019 the MSSA category no longer exists with all center-fire semi-auto rifles now in the restricted category. Rim-fire rifles holding more than 10 cartridges also now fall into the restricted class. Shotguns with a capacity of over 5 shells or fed by a box magazine are also restricted. All magazines holding more than 10 rounds are also restricted. Exempted semi-auto long arms include: rim fire rifles holding 10 rounds or less, and shotguns only with tubular magazines and a capacity of five rounds or less.\\"Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019\\" * A Category firearms are those that do not fall into any other category, and are the vast majority of legally-owned firearms in New Zealand. As of late 2020 the A category no longer includes center-fire semi-autos (except shotguns with a tubular magazine of 5 rounds or less). Rim- fire semi-autos with a magazine capacity of 10 or less are A category, as are all manual action rifles with a capacity of 10 rounds or less.\\"Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019\\" Registration is not required under the law but the police carry out a regime similar to registration for all but \\"A Category\\" firearms. Firearms in any other category require a \\"permit to procure\\" before they are transferred. =Firearm licence= Except under the direct supervision (i.e. arm's reach) of a licence holder, a person who possesses or uses firearms needs to hold a firearms licence issued by the police. Firearms licences are issued for 10 years, but can be revoked at any time if police believe the person is no longer fit and proper to possess a firearm. Visitors to New Zealand can apply from overseas for a 1 year visitor's licence based on their existing licence in their country of residence, though frequent visitors are encouraged to apply for a 10 year licence. Licence holders who possess or use pistols or military style semi-automatic firearms, as well as collectors, require additional endorsements. Firearms dealers and their employees need an annual dealer's licence for their place of business. Only licence holders can buy, sell, or exchange firearms; permits to procure are needed for restricted firearms and licence holders must have appropriate and current endorsements. Importing or exporting personally owned firearms requires additional permits, and the importer or exporter must be a current licence holder with appropriate endorsements. To become licensed, the applicant must be a fit and proper person over the age of 16. They also need to have adequate secure storage for firearms, attend a safety program administered by the Mountain Safety Council, pass a written safety test, pay the requisite fee, and supply passport- standard photographs with their application. Police also individually interview the applicant and two referees, one of whom must be a close relative and the other unrelated, to determine the applicant's suitability for a licence. The applicant's residence is also visited to check for appropriate storage of firearms and ammunition and to ensure any other people living there are not a security risk. Having criminal associations or a history of domestic violence almost always leads to a licence being refused. An application can be refused if the applicant has indicators of drug or alcohol abuse, criminal associations, a history of domestic violence, or a physical, mental health or disability issue that would prevent them possessing or using a firearm safely. Previous denied applications or revoked licences may also be cause for denial.  Other categories  A standard licence allows the use of \\"A Category\\" firearms. To possess firearms of another category, one must receive an endorsement by meeting additional requirements: B Endorsement ‚Äì Target (competition) pistols * Applicant must be a current financial member of a pistol club, a financial member of Pistol New Zealand (or in some cases membership of an approved club) and have attended at least 12 club shoots in the last 6 months before they can apply * Applicant must be sponsored by their club * Applicant must attend at least 12 club activities (either at their home club or to another recognised club) in a financial year * Applicant is normally limited to 12 registered pistols * Pistols must be of an approved sporting type * Pistols can only be carried to and from the range in a locked container with ammunition in a separate container or to a gunsmith * Pistols may only be shot on a Police approved pistol club range C Endorsement ‚Äì Restricted weapons * Applicant must provide proof of a need to own restricted weapons, such as for collecting and movie making * Firearms must be stored in an inoperable condition * Firearms cannot be used with live ammunition, but are allowed to fire blanks for movie making and re-enacting * Firearms can only be transported to an approved display venue, re-enactment event or to another collector for sale D Endorsement ‚Äì Dealers licence * Applicant must renew the endorsement annually * Applicant must maintain a written record of firearm purchases and sales * Applicant must maintain additional security requirements * If selling restricted weapons, applicant must receive endorsements for restricted weapons E Endorsement ‚Äì Military-style semi- automatics * A new class of restricted weapon that was created after the Aramoana shooting spree. At the time, anyone with an MSSA that wanted to keep it in that configuration was given a E endorsement (after going through the vetting and extra security requirements). Those people that did not want the extra hassle and expense of the endorsement converted their rifles into 'A' configuration by removing the components that made it an 'E'. *After the Christchurch massacre New Zealand enacted an outright ban on most semi- automatic weapons effectively making the e endorsement useless.https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-zealand-bans-military-style- semi-automatics-and-assault-rifles F Endorsement ‚Äì Dealers staff licence * This class allows an individual working for a dealer to demonstrate a pistol, military-style semi-automatic, or collectable weapon without having to have the corresponding endorsement. Individuals with this endorsement may demonstrate these weapons, but cannot possess one for personal use. = Buying and selling = Anyone buying firearms or ammunition, whether privately or from a dealer, must show their firearms licence. In addition, a permit to procure must be obtained prior to the transfer of pistols, military-style semi-automatics and restricted weapons. Sales can be made by mail-order, but a police officer must sign the order form to verify that the purchaser has a firearms licence. Previously, New Zealand allowed for the ownership of military-style semi-automatic weapons, which they refer to as MSSAs, and a legal loophole allowed many people to purchase them without a special designated licence. The loophole exists as MSSAs are classified by their parts so slight modifications can mean an MSSA can be purchased with a regular licence (Rosie Perper).  History  = Up to 1983 = Firearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native MƒÅori. This partly led to the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. As a largely agricultural society of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, long guns were a familiar tool for many people and outdoor pursuits involving guns, such as hunting, were often a source of food, and sometimes provided an income as well.Thorp 1997 The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the Arms Act in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at MƒÅori during the New Zealand Wars in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal. Strikes in 1912 and 1913, a Communist revolution in Russia, and large numbers of ex-military guns coming into the country after World War I were used as justification for a new law in 1920. The new law required the registration of all firearms and issue of a \\"permit to procure\\" before a firearm was transferred. Semi-automatic pistols were banned and a special permit was needed for other pistols (e.g. revolvers), with the intent of discouraging the carrying of concealed weapons. Few changes were seen for the next forty years as crime remained low and the country avoided political violence. Increasing gun crime in the 1960s led to greater police use of registration records, which were generally inaccurate or out-of-date. A project to check the register began in 1967, and found that 66 percent of entries were inaccurate in some way, with many guns not to be found at all. Police thought that the register was largely useless, and that substantial resources would be needed to keep it up-to-date. It was believed that the government would be unlikely to provide the resources required to update the register and that it would be politically difficult to demand registration information from firearm owners. = Arms Act 1983 = Various new laws were introduced in the 1970s and 80s, proposing more government checks, registration of shotguns (which had been abandoned) and individual licensing. An internal police report in 1982 criticised the proposals, saying there was no evidence that registration of guns helped to solve crimes, and that registration would use time and money better spent on other police work. This policy was adopted by the government in the 1983 Act.Thorp, T.M.: \\"Review of Firearms Control in New Zealand\\", 1997 The 1983 Arms Act abandoned registration for most long guns, as Parliament felt it was prohibitively expensive and not particularly useful. The philosophy of the new system was to control users, rather than firearms. Police were required to conduct a background check before a licence would be issued (though existing owners would be issued a licence automatically), but once a person had a licence there was no requirement to register long guns or obtain a permit-to-procure when they were sold or lent. The Arms Code advises firearms owners to transport their firearms in a padded cover or hard case, so guns are now rarely seen in public. Special restrictions applied to restricted weapons and pistols, which needed to be registered. However, the new sport of target pistol shooting became more popular, and pistol club shooters can own pistols with a special \\"B\\" endorsement. = Aramoana and the 1992 amendments to the Act = After the Aramoana massacre in November 1990, John Banks, the Minister for Police, announced that the government would ban what he and others described as \\"Rambo-style\\" weapons and substantially tighten gun laws generally. The law was eventually passed in 1992 and required written permits to order guns or ammunition by mail order, restricted ammunition sales to firearms licence holders, added photographs to firearms licences, required licence holders to have secure storage for firearms at their homes (which would be inspected before a licence was issued), and, controversially, required all licence holders to be re-vetted for new licences, which would be valid for only 10 years. The law also created the new category of \\"military- style semi-automatic\\", which like the Federal Assault Weapons Ban two years later in the United States, mainly covered the appearance rather than the functionality of the guns. These required a special endorsement, security and registration in the same manner as pistols, but could be used wherever A-category guns could. In 2019 after the Christchurch mosque shootings John Banks said that he was \\"haunted\\" by not being able to persuade his cabinet colleagues to ban semi-automatic guns after the Aramoana massacre in 1990. = Thorp Report 1997 = After two shootings by police in 1995, the government ordered an inquiry into police procedures for storing and using firearms. Before the review started, massacres overseas at Dunblane, Scotland, and Port Arthur, Australia led the government to expand the scope of the review to encompass gun control generally. The police reported in May 1996Thorp, 1997 that the system was sound and that no major changes were needed. The government decided in August 1996 to order an independent report, this one led by former judge Sir Thomas Thorp. His report was released in June 1997 and was the most comprehensive and detailed review of the 150 years of firearms controls in New Zealand. Thorp's report explored how New Zealand had arrived at its existing legislation, its underlying principles, its effectiveness compared to other countries, its administration and cost. Thorp made numerous detailed recommendations in 28 different areas. His recommendations called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including setting up a separate Firearms Authority to overhaul the licensing process, restricting ammunition sales to just the firearms owned, banning various firearms features, that licences be renewed every three years to keep track of changes of address and that all guns be registered. The recommendation for a register was particularly unpopular with firearm owners. Criminologist Greg Newbold appraised Thorp's recommendations and concluded that while Thorp's report was a valuable snapshot of firearms and their use in New Zealand, it would be politically difficult to implement most recommendations and would depend on the additional resources the government was prepared to devote to implementing them, though he doubted their cost effectiveness in any case. Newbold also argued that none of Thorp's recommendations would have prevented any of the post-1990 massacres, because criminals would still have access to unlawful guns that were not subject to any controls, in any case only another massacre would generate enough political will to implement Thorp's recommendations. = Arms Amendment Bills 2 and 3 (1999 to 2012) = In April 1999, in anticipation of the APEC summit September of that year the Arms Amendment Act 1999 was passed, giving the power to authorise \\"any foreign personal protection officer\\" to carry \\"firearms, airguns, pistols, and restricted weapons, and such quantities and types of ammunition as are specified...\\", but this automatically expired on 30 September 1999. The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it. In March 2012, an order of the day for a second reading of the Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill was discharged. = 2009‚Äì2018 = In August 2009, the police decided that any firearm, including single shot bolt action rifles, with a free-standing pistol grip that could allow the firearm to be shot inaccurately from the hip would be defined as an MSSA. However, the High Court rejected this attempt in Lincoln v Police [2010] BCL 194; 33 TCL 11/2. Parliament subsequently amended the Arms Act as a result of the court decision. In 2015, a TV reporter demonstrated how to subvert processes to purchase a gun by mail-order. Police promptly changed their mail-order processes and commenced a criminal investigation. In March 2016, after Police seized 14 illegally owned MSSA weapons in a raid in south Auckland and 4 officers were shot during an armed siege in Kawerau, Parliament's Law and Order Select Committee announced an Inquiry into issues relating to the illegal possession of firearms in New Zealand. In their final report the committee made 20 recommendations, of which the National government accepted 7 and modified another. The government introduced the Arms (Firearm Prohibition Orders and Firearms Licences) Amendment Bill to implement several of the recommendations shortly before the 2017 election but it lapsed with the change of government. It was subsequently drawn as a member's bill but it failed to pass at the first reading. The Minister also directed Police to improve their administrative processes and consultation with the firearms community. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was the chair of an executive committee which in 2018 ushered through amendments to the Arms Regulations 2002, to allow Police to accept and process various applications concerning firearms licences and weapons transactions electronically. The Arms (Electronic Transactions) Amendment Regulations 2018 were published in the Gazette on 20 December 2018. Previously under the Arms Act, if someone wanted to become a gun dealer, get a firearms licence, import a restricted weapon, or get a permit to buy a military-style semi-automatic, they had to physically deliver an application to their nearest police station. The regulations also allow for a buyer of a restricted weapon to show that weapon to police by video call ‚Äì whereas in the past they had to take it into the station. =Christchurch mosque shootings= In the wake of the mosque shootings in Christchurch, Prime Minister Ardern announced: \\"Our gun laws will change, now is the time... People will be seeking change, and I am committed to that.\\" Ardern continued by stating, \\"There have been attempts to change our laws in 2005, 2012 and after an inquiry in 2017. Now is the time for change.\\" Attorney-General David Parker was later quoted as saying that the government would ban semi-automatic guns, but he subsequently backtracked, saying that the government had not yet committed to anything and that regulations around semi-automatic weapons was \\"one of the issues\\" the government would consider. On 20 March 2019, Ardern announced that all military style semi-automatics and assault rifles would be banned. The first step in this process was taken on 21 March by reclassifying most semi-automatic firearms as \\"military style semi- automatic firearms\\" for the purpose of the Arms Act 1983, pursuant to section 74A(c) of the statute. On 10 April, the Government passed the Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019, banning semi-automatic firearms, magazines, and parts. The Arms Amendment Bill was supported by all parties except the opposition ACT Party's sole MP David Seymour. In addition, the government announced an amnesty and buy-back scheme for prohibited firearms and components, which was later extended to 20 December 2019. As part of the buy-back program, the New Zealand Police organized a series of nationwide local collection events for gun owners to hand in prohibited firearms. By 22 July, over 2,000 guns had been handed in at buyback events in Auckland and Wellington over the past weekend. On 22 July, Prime Minister Ardern announced a second series of gun reforms including creating a national firearms register, tighter restrictions on who can obtain a firearms licence, and a ban on overseas visitors buying guns in New Zealand while still allowing them to bring personal firearms into the country. The New Zealand Police's union, the Police Association, has supported the establishment of a national gun register and welcomed the government's proposed reforms. Police Minister Stuart Nash announced that the Government would be drafting a new bill to codify these proposed reforms, which would be in August with a three-month select committee process to follow. In late August, a draft version of the Government's proposed new gun laws was leaked to the opposition National Party. National gun spokesperson Brett Hudson claimed that new legislation could lead to doctors \\"dobbing\\" in patients. On 13 September 2019, Prime Minister Ardern and Police Minister Nash announced that the Government would be introducing an Arms Legislation Bill in late September. This bill would create a firearms register in order to stop the flow of guns to criminal groups. It attracted criticism from the National Party and gun lobby groups, who claimed it would punish lawful firearm owners and gun clubs instead of criminals. According to Al Jazeera and Reuters, more than 19,100 firearms and 70,800 gun accessories have been surrendered to the gun amnesty as of mid September 2019. According to the Small Arms Survey, New Zealand has the 17th highest rate of civilian gun ownership with 1.5 million firearms distributed over a population of under 5 million.  Notable groups  = Enforcement = The New Zealand Police administer and enforce the Arms Act 1983. New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world where police officers routinely go unarmed. They are issued Bushmaster XM-15 semi-automatic rifles, Glock 17 gen 4 pistols, and Tasers, which are normally carried in patrol cars and not on the officers. However, the Police Association, which represents police officers themselves, has called for gun registration and routine arming of police because officers report that they more frequently encounter criminals who are prepared to use firearms against police, or find firearms at crime scenes or during the execution of search warrants. = Lobby groups = The New Zealand Police Association, the police union / service association, has repeatedly lobbied for greater access to firearms for police officers, as well as stricter regulations on licensed firearm owners. The Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) was set up in 1996. The Sporting Shooters Association of New Zealand is a part-time lobby group that is usually only active at elections and when there are government calls for gun control laws. It is smaller than COLFO. The National Shooters Association is a nationwide civilian gun owners association that took the forefront in a 2009 legal challenge against unauthorised police interference with gun regulations. Its executive is largely made up of former members of the Practical Shooting Institute, a predecessor group which had similar success bringing court action against police interference in 1990. Previously influential groups that are generally no longer active include the Coalition for Gun Control, and Gunsafe NZ. These groups were led by activist Philip Alpers and Mike Meyrick, a former police officer and lawyer. A new lobby group, Gun Control NZ, was launched in May 2019 in response to the Christchurch attacks.\\"New Gun Control Group Pushes for National Register\\", The New Zealand Herald, 28 May 2019 = Positions of political parties = New Zealand's main political parties, Labour and National, generally treat gun control as a bi-partisan issue. Both supported the passage of the Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill. The Outdoor Recreation party was formed in 2001 to support hunting and sport fishing. It failed to gain any seats in 2002, and again in 2005, when, with the United Future party, it contested the election. The Green Party supports an increase in legislative restrictions on public access to firearms. The Greens' policies include the full ban of private ownership of all semi-automatic firearms and the reintroduction of a national firearms registry. The New Zealand First party supports the rights of New Zealanders to own and use firearms safely and responsibly for hunting, sport, pest control, target shooting, and Home Defence (Castle doctrine). The party does not support calls for universal gun registration, preferring the licensing of individual users. New Zealand First believes restrictions on firearm ownership by type should be dictated by functionality rather than appearance. The Act Party was the only party to vote against the Arms Amendment Bill. The Act party oppose the ban on semi- automatics, oppose calls for an arms register and also oppose magazine restrictions for firearms.https://www.act.org.nz/firearms_policy After the Christchurch Massacre the Act party claimed they supported change but argued that the legislation parliament passed was rushed and unjust.  Statistical indicators  The Thorp inquiry found that reliable information was not available to answer basic questions about the number and types of firearms owned, used, traded, sold by the army, lost, stolen, or destroyed; people owning and using firearms legally or illegally; surrendered, revoked or refused firearms licences; re-licensing compliance; crime committed with firearms; and the cost of administering licensing and enforcement. =Firearms licence holders= Nearly 250,000 people currently hold a New Zealand Firearms licence. In 1997, Thorp found that in 1982, prior to the introduction of lifetime licences, police had estimated there were about 300,000 firearms owners who could apply for a lifetime firearms licence under the 1983 Act. By 1991, there were 327,000 lifetime licence holders who were required to reapply for a 10 year photographic licence or surrender their lifetime licence. Thorp estimated that by 1998 only 204,000 would do so, given a 60% call-in compliance rate, which suggested between 90,000 and 120,000 licence holders had not responded to the call-in notices, likely because of difficulties in contacting them. Poor record keeping by police of surrendered lifetime licences prior to 1994 further complicated matters. =Gun ownership= The number of people who own or use guns in New Zealand is not known. Anyone over the age of 18 can own or use an air gun or antique firearm; these do not need to be registered provided the gun is not a restricted weapon. A range of firearms that are used as agricultural or construction tools do not require a firearms licence. Holding a firearms licence does not imply a person owns the gun they possess or use; the firearm could be owned by a business or organisation, club, dealer, or another licence holder, or be part of a deceased person's estate and held on trust for safekeeping. Thorp noted that a 1989 survey found that 9% of licence holders did not own a firearm. A survey conducted for Thorp's 1997 review found 20% of New Zealand's households had a gun, with about 1.8 gun users per household. These statistics provide an estimate between 350,000 and 400,000 New Zealand gun users. =Civilian armory= There are an estimated 1.5 million firearms in the New Zealand civilian armory, although this figure may simply be extrapolated from estimates made by Thorp in 1997 and could therefore be an overestimate. In 1997, Thorp estimated there were between 750,000 and a million firearms in New Zealand, He also believed about three-fifths were rifles and about two-fifths were shotguns, though the exact ratio is uncertain because different surveys used provided different estimates. Details of the majority of firearms are often known only to their owners. The number of unlawfully held firearms is even more uncertain. Thorp estimated that there were between 10,000 and 25,000 firearms owned by people with criminal intent, along with possibly another 100,000 \\"grey guns\\", held by unlicensed individuals, but not intended for criminal purposes. Since only pistols and military style semi-automatic firearms need to be registered with police, their numbers are more certain, though changes in legislation mean that if a firearm was not registered at the time, it might remain unregistered. =Information sources= Apart from the Thorp report, most statistical information about firearms numbers, licensing and trading is available only from the New Zealand Police. Although the police publish some information in annual reports or when reporting to Select Committees, most information is made available only as a result of requests for Official Information. In June 2018, police announced that they would proactively publish responses to Official Information Act requests that contained data or information about firearms that might be of wide public interest.

Public life In 1914, he began to practice as a public accountant. Upon the establishment of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia Jolly was elected a member of the first Board. He was the director of the National Bank of Australia after it merged with the Queensland National Bank. He was councillor of Kings College at the University of Queensland, a member of the Board for the YMCA and a long-term member of the Brisbane Rotary Club. He was elected an alderman of the Windsor Town Council in 1912, becoming the Mayor between 1918 and 1923. In 1925, the present City of Brisbane was created through the amalgamation of the city (which previously covered only the innermost suburbs) with all of the local government areas that contained its suburbs (known as the Greater Brisbane scheme). Jolly was elected the first Lord Mayor of Brisbane in 1925 and held that role until 1931. After seven years of agitation, Brisbane's tram service was extended to Grange in July 1928. The opening ceremony was attended by Jolly, and two Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, James Stevingstone Kerr and Charles Taylor. The mayor had previously threatened not to attend any ceremony for the opening of the tram service because two rival groups were organising separate celebrations; he would only attend if there was a single ceremony. In 1928, artist Caroline Barker painted a portrait of Lord Mayor of Brisbane William Jolly in his mayoral robes and exhibited it at the Royal Queensland Art Society. Charles Herbert Gough was so impressed by the work that he initiated a public subscription to purchase the portrait as a gift for the mayor from the citizens of Brisbane. As Jolly was a popular mayor, the public were generous in their donations and the portrait was presented to the mayor in December 1928 together with a string of pearls for his wife, the Lady Mayoress. During his time as Lord Mayor, Jolly was responsible for many civic developments, especially the arterial road network in Brisbane. The Grey Street Bridge (renamed the William Jolly Bridge shortly after his death) was built during his time in office. In 1937 and 1940, he stood and was elected the UAP member for the Federal Division of Lilley. William Jolly retired from politics following his defeat in the 1943 general election., ‚Äî Psephos: Adam Carr's Electoral Archive He was a director of the Queensland National Bank and at the time of his death a director of the National Bank of Australasia. Personal life Lillie Maude Moorhouse Jolly (wife of Lord Mayor William Jolly), 1930 William Jolly was born on 11 September 1881 at Spring Hill, Brisbane, the son of Alexander Jolly, a gardener from Scotland, and his Irish wife Mary Kelly. His father was the gardener at the Glen Lyon Estate in Ashgrove. Later his father became the landscape gardener of the Ithaca Town Council and created the parkland surrounding the Ithaca War Memorial and the Ithaca Embankments (both of which are now heritage-listed). The grave of William Jolly at Brisbane's alt=Jolly was described as a family man who was active in church activities. He attended Ashgrove State School. He began working as law clerk with at a small law firm and then moved to the larger Atthow & MacGregor while studying accountancy. On 8 January 1907, he married Lillie Maude Moorhouse, the second daughter of Rev. James Moorhouse, at her parents' residence in Paddington. They had seven sons: Douglas, Frank, Arthur, William, Stanley, Harold and Norman. Jolly died in Windsor on 30 May 1955 aged 73 years. He was buried on 31 May 1955 in Toowong Cemetery.

Geographic distribution The Khmuic peoples are aboriginal to Laos and surrounding areas. Most Khmuic peoples live in northern Laos and neighboring areas in Vietnam, although they can also be found in Thailand, Burma and China. Individual Khmuic speaking groups The individual Khmuic ethnic groups are as follows: *Khmu *Khmu U *Khmu Rok *Khmu Kwean *Khmu Cheuang *Khmu Leu *Khmu Yuan *Khmu Khrong *Khmu Kasak *Khmu Mea Other two groups: Khmu Chuang and Khmu Kaye are extinct or were assimilated in other ethnic groups especially Khmu Chuang was believed to be extinct, absorbed or assimilated by or into Khmer. In the ancient time, the Khmu Chuang lived in the southern part of Khmuic territory which is the area of the present day southern Laos). The Khmu Kaye lived in the eastern part of Khmuic territory which is the area of the present day Xiengkhuang province. Be in mind that some scholars confuse Khmu Cheuang [c…Øa≈ã] and Khmu Chuang [cua≈ã]. These two groups are not the same, Khmu Cheuang are still exist in the present day and mostly live in northwestern of Vietnam. Non-Khmu peoples The following are individual ethnic groups which some scholars misunderstand that they are Khmu and speak Khmuic. In fact they are much different from Khmu, in both language and culture. There are only a few words (less than 10%) of their vocabularies that resemble Khmuic. *Lua *Mal (also known as the Tin in Thailand and the Thin in Laos) *Mlabri (also known as the Yumbri) *O Du *Phai *Pray *Xinh Mul *Phong *Phong-Kniang *Khang There are also the Khao and Bit peoples which were once thought to be Khmuic, although recent linguistic studies suggest they are probably Palaungic. Origin The Khmuic peoples are believed to have migrated by land from China to Laos, where they have resided for at least 4,000 years. Some 10,000 years ago, they were probably part of a largely homogenous ethnicity, now referred to as the Austro-Asiatic peoples, with a homeland somewhere within the borders of the modern-day People's Republic of China. The prevalence of Y-DNA Haplogroup O among Austro-Asiatic peoples suggests a common ancestry with the Sino-Tibetan, Austronesian, and Hmong‚ÄìMien peoples some 35,000 years ago in China. Haplogroup O is a subclade of Y-DNA Haplogroup K, which is believed to have originated approximately 40,000 years ago somewhere between Iran and Central China. In addition to the ethnicities previously mentioned, the progenitor of Haplogroup K was the patrilineal ancestor of nearly all modern Melanesians and Native Americans. Haplogroup K, in turn, is a subclade of Y-DNA Haplogroup F, which is believed to have originated in Northern Africa some 45,000 years ago. In addition to the ethnicities previously mentioned, the progenitor of Haplogroup F was probably the ancestor of all Indo-Europeans. Language Their languages belong to the Khmuic language family, which is a branch of the Austro-Asiatic language family. Most scholars agree that the Khmuic languages are part of the Mon‚ÄìKhmer branch of the Austro-Asiatic family, but the validity of the Mon‚ÄìKhmer branch has recently been called into question. Society The Khmuic are generally an agricultural people, although gathering, hunting, trapping and fishing are also parts of the Khmuic lifestyle.

Founded by promoter Dennis Wippercht and wrestler Tim \\"Lucifer\\" Burke in 1991, the MEWF was one of the leading independent promotions on the East Coast during the 1990s rivaling promotions such as East Coast Wrestling Association, Jersey All Pro Wrestling and Maryland Championship Wrestling. Among its roster included Extreme Championship Wrestling regulars such as Raven, Stevie Richards, The Blue Meanie, Damien Kane, Pit Bull #2, referee \\"Judge\\" Jeff Jones, and The Bad Breed (Ian and Axl Rotten) as well as some of the leading independent wrestlers such as Cueball Carmichael, Johnny Gunn, Max Thrasher, Devon Storm, Morgus the Maniac, Boo Bradley, Jimmy Cicero, Hollywood Bob Starr, Ruckus, Dino Casanova, Corporal Punishment, The Bad Crew and Darkside (Glen Osborne and Rockin' Rebel). Former World Wrestling Federation wrestlers such as Barry Horowitz, Road Warrior Hawk, Jim Neidhart, The Honky Tonk Man and The Headbangers as well as World Championship Wrestling veterans \\"Jumping\\" Joey Maggs and Disco Inferno also had short stints in the promotion.

Three months later, the MEWF held a fundraiser for the North Carroll High School in Hampstead, Maryland to help purchase computer software for its business department. The card included stars such as \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert, A.C. Golden, Morgus the Maniac, Axl Rotten, The Cream Team (Dino Casanova & Rip Sawyer), female wrestlers Rusty \\"The Fox\\" Thomas and MEWF Women's Champion Heidi Lee Morgan, and midget wrestler Haiti Kid.

Establishment of the Commission An ardent believer in Spiritualism, Henry Seybert left in his will funds for the establishment of an endowed chair in Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania. As a condition to this bequest, he required that the University set up a commission to investigate \\"all systems of Morals, Religion, or Philosophy which assume to represent the Truth, and particularly of Modern Spiritualism.\\"The Seybert Commission Preliminary Report Ten men served on the commission, all of whom declared themselves at the outset to either be neutral or favorably disposed toward Spiritualism. Among the more notable members were the University Provost William Pepper (a physician), the paleontologist Joseph Leidy, the Shakespearean scholar Horace Howard Furness (who served as the chairman), and the physician and writer Silas Weir Mitchell. Also on the commission was George Augustus Koenig, a chemist. A committed Spiritualist and close friend of Henry Seybert, Thomas Hazard, served as counselor, suggesting particular topics and mediums that should be investigated. Slate writing Example of slate-writing. The topic most conclusively investigated was \\"slate writing,\\" in which the medium has two slates fastened together, so that the writing surfaces faced each other, out of reach of the medium, with a small piece of pencil between the two slates. The medium holds the slates in her lap, and spirits purportedly write on the slates, sending the pencil outside the slates when finished. The Commission investigated Mrs. S.E. Patterson and Dr. Henry Slade, both widely respected practitioners of slate writing. Mrs. Patterson proved unable to perform when under the scrutiny of the Commission, while Dr. Slade was found to be practicing fraud: either composing long, well-written messages before the s√©ance, or loosening the screws holding the slates together and scrawling nearly illegible messages while holding the slates in his lap. The Commission also requested that a \\"professional juggler\\" attempt slate writing, and found that he was able to provide demonstrations \\"much more remarkable\\" than the \\"puerile\\" attempts at fraud by Dr. Slade. The Commission concluded that slate writing > \\"is performed in a manner so closely resembling fraud as to be > indistinguishable from it. It would be a mere matter of opinion that all > Independent Slate Writing is fraudulent; what is not a matter of opinion is > the conviction, which we have unanimously reached as a Commission, of its > non-spiritual character in every instance that has come before us.\\" Spirit rappings The Commission also investigated \\"rappings\\", without coming to final conclusions. A thorough investigation of rappings required monitoring the medium's body closely to determine if the sound was caused by \\"voluntary muscular action.\\" Such monitoring was \\"a matter of delicacy,\\" and therefore difficult to accomplish. Nevertheless, the Commission was able to determine \\"that the Mediums were invariably, and confessedly, cognizant of the rappings whenever they occurred, and could at once detect any spurious rappings, however exact and indistinguishable to all other ears might be the imitation.\\" This finding suggested that the medium, rather than spirits, were the source of the rappings. Movement of objects The commission investigated the physical mediumship of Pierre L. O. A. Keeler which involved the movement of musical instruments such as a guitar and a tambourine. The phenomena was suspected of being fraudulent, in most cases achieved if Keeler had been able to get his arm free from control.Johnson, Paul Christopher. (2014). Spirited Things: The Work of \\"Possession\\" in Afro-Atlantic Religions. University of Chicago Press. pp. 95-96. Spirit photography The Commission attempted to examine a famed \\"spirit photographer,\\" William M. Keeler. Spirit photography, in the 1880s, was much like conventional portrait photography, except that the developed plates would show shadowy figures, usually identified by the subject as deceased loved ones.History of Spirit Photography Accessed 28 November 2007 Mr. Keeler demanded such a high fee and imposed so many conditions on the Commission that they concluded that he was unwilling to be examined and that investigating him would be a waste of time. The Commission noted that \\"In these days of 'Composite Photography' it is worse than childish to claim a Spiritual source for results which can be obtained at any time by any tyro in the art.\\" The Report The Commission published a report in 1887 entitled Preliminary Report of the Commission Appointed by the University of Pennsylvania to Investigate Modern Spiritualism In Accordance with the Request of the Late Henry Seybert, in which it expressed: > \\"...our regret that thus far we have not been cheered in our investigations > by the discovery of a single novel fact; but, undeterred by this > discouragement, we trust with your permission to continue them with what > thoroughness our future opportunities may allow, and with minds as sincerely > and honestly open, as heretofore, to conviction.\\" The report was published by J.B. Lippincott, and angrily denounced by Spiritualists. There proved to be no sentiment for the Commission's continued existence, and it quietly disbanded.Drabelle 2006. Significance of the Seybert Commission A number of independent investigators examined the claims of Spiritualists in the Nineteenth Century. The Seybert Commission stands as an example of reputable and impartial investigators concluding that Spiritualist mediums were engaging in fraud.Gallagher, Eugene V; Ashcraft, W. Michael. (2006). Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America. Greenwood. pp. 39-40. The report's appendices provide a good primary source describing how Spiritualist mediums operated in the mid-1880s.

One of the leading baritones of the 20th century and particularly associated with the French and Italian repertoires, he was considered a fine singing actor equally at home in dramatic or comic roles and gave regular song recitals. He was a long-term member of the Op√©ra-Comique and the Paris Opera, but forged a long career internationally at leading opera houses in Europe and the U.S. His large discography spans five decades, and he was considered as ‚Äúthe ambassador of French song‚Äù.Alain P√¢ris.

Leaving school aged 14, he worked at his uncle's print-shop, while studying in Montpellier to become a commercial artist, but during the Vichy regime, to avoid the round-ups and deportations by the Service du travail obligatoire, his parents arranged for him to do national service in the Chantiers de Jeunesse on the railways during the Occupation. As a teenager he took voice lessons with a Madame Bastard in B√©ziers in his free time and made his operatic debut during the war as Ourrias in Gounod's Mireille in the town arena. After World War II, he entered the Paris Conservatoire, receiving a scholarship because of his family's modest means,Oussenko, Sylvie. Gabriel Bacquier, le genie de l'interpretation.

() In his final year, the director of the Conservatoire, Claude Delvincourt, allowed him leave to work at the Op√©ra de Nice in the 1949‚Äì50 season, singing small roles in operas and operettas; this along with regular singing spots in cinemas gave him important experience and income before his next career steps. Having already gained a first prize for op√©ra comique in his penultimate year, he won first prize for singing and second prize for opera at the conclusion of his formal studies. Around this time he also took a course in dramatic art. Career in France and Belgium He joined the opera company of Jos√© Beckmans in 1950, and was a member of La Monnaie in Brussels from 1953 until 1956, making his debut in the title role of Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia. There he sang the French repertory, both in opera (Gounod's Faust, Delibes' Lakm√©, Massenet's Manon and Werther) and in operetta (Ang√©lique, La belle H√©l√®ne, Les Cloches de Corneville, Miss Heylett, Monsieur Beaucaire).

Bacquier made his debut at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris in 1956, as Sharpless in Madama Butterfly, soon followed by Alfio in Cavalleria Rusticana and Albert in Werther. Having stood in at short notice to sing Verdi's Rigoletto at the Paris Opera,{Oussenko, p37} after his transfer to that house he made his official debut at the Palais Garnier on 21 September 1959 as Germont in Verdi's La traviata, and was soon seen as Valentin, Mercutio and again as Rigoletto.

In 1960, he made his first appearance at the Aix-en-Provence Festival as Mozart's Don Giovanni, and the first time an opera from the festival had been broadcast around Europe by Eurovision.

The station was most recently a sports talk format known as \\"JOCK 98.7 ESPN.\\" This format moved to 98.7 FM's sister stations KBFL (AM) and KBFL-FM (1060 AM/96.9 FM/99.9 FM) on July 30, 2020 as part of the purchase of the Meyer Communications owned stations (which also includes KWTO (AM) and KWTO- FM) by Zimmer Midwest Communications. History KWTO-FM went on the air on November 23, 1967; it later adopted a rock format and was known as \\"Rock 99\\". This format lasted well into the 1980s until rival station KXUS went on the air in April 1985 with a similar format. Rock 99 was originally an automated music format utilizing the TM Stereo Rock format based from Dallas, TX. Several FM radio stations used this format during the 1970s into the 1980s. These stations had the same announcer and same call letter type music jingles. One example, WIBW-FM 97.3 in Topeka, KS was Rock 97 and sounded just like KWTO-FM Rock 99. That was a great automated music format without the talkative DJ's, it was rock, pop, oldies, and some album cuts. The on-air format basically went like this: Two new songs followed by two older songs then commercial break (usually four commercials) then call letter jingle and back to the music. In March 1987, the station adopted a more Top-40 format and became \\"99 Hit FM\\". The call letters were changed to KKHT in 1990,Call Sign History, fcc.gov.

In 2001, the station adopted an all-sports format and became known as \\"The JOCK, 98.7 FM\\". The station became an affiliate of Fox Sports Radio but also carried The Jim Rome Show from CBS Sports Radio daily. On October 23, 2014, it was announced that KWTO-FM would drop Fox Sports Radio and affiliate with ESPN Radio effective January 1, 2015.

It operates on 560 kHz, where it airs a news-talk format. The station is owned by Zimmer Midwest Communications. History KWTO was founded by Lester E. Cox and began broadcasting on December 25, 1933. Cox applied for and got the call letters KWTO, which stood for \\"Keep Watching The Ozarks.\\" Cox also applied for several others including KCMO in Kansas City. Since (at the time) the Federal Radio Commission prohibited playing recorded music on the air, the station had its own live bands. From the 1930s through the 1950s, KWTO's staff musicians included Slim Wilson and the Tall Timber Trio, Chet Atkins, The Carter Family, Wynn Stewart, Les Paul, The Haden Family and The Goodwill Family. KWTO'S Korn's-A-Krackin', a weekly \\"hillbilly variety\\" program, was carried nationally by the Mutual Broadcasting System. During the late 1940s and 1950s, the station played a key role in launching the careers of stars such as Porter Wagoner and The Browns. In 1954, the station began carrying Ozark Jubilee, which became an ABC-TV and radio show. In 1959, KWTO broke with its live music tradition and began playing country records, and for the next 30 years was known as \\"56 Country.\\" On October 22, 1990, KWTO ended its long-standing country format and became the Ozarks' first full-time news- talk radio station, which carries the programs of talk-show hosts including Rush Limbaugh Chris Plante, Jim Bohannon (who once worked at the station), and Joe Pags. With his 2008 album Rambling Boy, Charlie Haden acknowledged KWTO's country roots by featuring the station's transmission tower on the album's cover. On December 10, 2008, Rep.

It is the headquarters for the science operations of the International Space Station (ISS), working in conjunction with the ISS and Space Shuttle control centers in Houston, Texas. The Payload Operations Center links Earth-bound researchers and developers from around the world with their experiments and astronauts on board the ISS. The everyday tasks performed at the center during the life of the ISS include: * Integrating research requirements * Planning science missions * Ensuring the safe execution of research * Integrating the crew and ground team training, and research mission timelines * Managing use of space station payload resources * Handling science communications with the crew * Managing command and data transmissions to and from the orbiting research center The Payload Operations Center is staffed around the clock by three shifts of flight controllers. Payload Operations Center =Console Positions= A total of eight flight controllers staff the Payload Operations Center front room. They are:  Payload Operations Director (POD)  The POD manages day-to-day operations of payloads on board the space station. This position is the single point-of-authority to the International Space Station Mission Control Center Flight Director in Houston for all of NASA's payload operations. The POD oversees team members responsible for managing payload mission planning, ground commanding of space station payloads, communications with the crew, use of the payload support system, the video system and the data systems. The POD ensures compliance with established safety requirements, flight rules and payload regulations. The POD also leads the review and approval of all change requests to the timeline.  Operations Controller (OC)  The Operations Controller leads a team that is responsible for maintaining the daily payload work assignments; ensuring scheduled research activities are accomplished safely and on time, and managing and tracking available resources. The OC leads resolution of NASA payload anomalies, and monitors troubleshooting of on board systems to identify possible impacts to payload operations. The position assesses change requests for impacts to the current science timeline, payload hardware assets and resources required for science such as crew time and electrical power. The OC also is responsible for evaluating requests by scientists for changes to the experiment timeline, and then implementing changes to the science operations plan on board.  Payload Rack Officer (PRO)  The PRO is responsible for the configuration of ExPRESS payload racks in the International Space Station's Destiny laboratory, and for coordinating the configuration of systems resources to all NASA payload racks. When a new payload is installed, the PRO configures the rack interfaces to properly support the payload. For existing payloads, the PRO configures the EXPRESS racks to power payloads on or off, monitors the health and status of both the payload and the rack and if necessary, coordinates troubleshooting of the payload support structure and payload interfaces. The PRO also is responsible for managing all ground commanding of U. S. payload systems and experiments on board the International Space Station. The PRO manages the command system, receives and sends command files to the mass storage device and configures the system to allow flight controllers in the Payload Operations Center and remote users to send commands to their equipment on the space station.  Data Management Coordinator (DMC)  The Data Management Coordinator is responsible for command, control, data handling, communications and tracking for science payloads on the space station. The DMC manages the integrated high data rate (Ku-band) communications link between the ground and the station. This position manages data system traffic, downlink video, assures ground data quality with NASA users, and assesses data system change requests. The DMC ensures that the data system is properly configured to support payload operations. The DMC also is responsible for managing video coverage of research activity on the station. The DMC monitors, configures and coordinates the use of the video system.  Payload Communications Manager (PAYCOM)  The PAYCOM, using the call sign, \\"Huntsville,\\" is the prime communicator with the International Space Station astronaut crew on payload matters. The PAYCOM is responsible for enabling researchers around-the-world to talk directly with the crew about their experiments, and for managing payload conferences. Additionally, the PAYCOM reviews requests for changes to payload activity to assess their impact on the crew.  POIC Stowage  The POIC Stowage console position is responsible for tracking the stowage locations of payload hardware, tools, and items on the International Space Station. This console position develops products that ensure the ISS crew knows where to locate every item they need for their day to day experiments, and helps maintain an inventory database for accurate tracking of those items. They also support the crew by helping them locate missing items. When the crew calls down and reports an item lost, the POIC Stowage console conducts investigations using video, imagery, and many other resources to come up with alternate search locations. The Stowage Team maintains a high level of situational awareness and knowledge of the current layout of station to ensure the crew can always find what they need to perform payload ops successfully.  Marshall GC (GC)  The Marshall GC (Marshall Ground Control) is responsible for troubleshooting ground system issues as the ground system expert. Marshall GC leads troubleshooting of real time commanding, telemetry, communication, and facility issues. Other duties that Marshall GC perform are coordinating payload video restrictions, space-to-ground enablement, space-to- ground restrictions, and ground system maintenance. If payload developers have any ground system issues, Marshall GC is the real time coordinator to resolve such issues. As the ground system expert, Marshall GC is the HOSC interface for Backup Control Center (BCC) operations.  Timeline Change Officer (TCO)  The Timeline Change Officer (TCO) serves as the real-time expert on all NASA payload planning-related information for the International Space Station. Coordinating with NASA control centers, International Partners, and NASA Payload Developers, the TCO bridges the gap between long range planning and execution of the plan on board by the crew. The TCO team supports real-time operations seven days a week, twenty-four hours per day; in addition, short term planning operations are supported five days a week, eight hours per day.

The result was a French victory. Background The Duke of Wellington's Anglo and Portuguese army gave up its unsuccessful Siege of Burgos on 21 October 1812 and withdrew southwest toward Torquemada. Wellington's 35,000-man army was pursued by Maj-Gen Joseph Souham's reinforced Army of Portugal of 53,000 soldiers. Forces Major- General Stapleton Cotton's rearguard included Colonel Colin Halkett's King's German Legion (KGL) brigade (1st and 2nd KGL Light battalions), Major-General George Anson's light cavalry brigade (11th, 12th, and 16th Light Dragoons), Major-General Eberhardt von Bock's heavy cavalry brigade (1st and 2nd King's German Legion Dragoons), and Norman Ramsay's RHA troop of six cannons. The total strength was 2,800 men. Curto's light cavalry brigade was made up of the 3rd Hussars and the remnants of the 13th, 14th, 22nd, 26th, and 28th Chasseurs. Boyer's dragoon brigade included the 6th, 11th, 15th, and 25th Dragoons. Colonel Faverot, in charge of the 15th Chasseurs and Duchy of Berg Light Horse Lancers, and Colonel B√©teille, head of the √©lite Gendarmes, also rode with the advanced guard. The French force numbered 3,200 men. Battle On 23 October, Cotton drew up his cavalry in front of a stone bridge where the main highway crossed a deep, dry streambed. He planned to ambush the French advanced guard. As the French approached, Anson's cavalry would file across the bridge and presumably the French would closely follow. After the French had crossed, Ramsay's guns would open fire on them and Bock's dragoons would then charge them. Meanwhile, on the British left flank, Curto's hussars had crossed the dry stream bed further upstream and attacked mounted Spaniards under the command of Marquinez posted on the hills overlooking the battlefield. As the Spaniards came pouring down the hills, closely pursued by the French hussars, the whole mass fell upon the 16th Light Dragoon, which was simultaneously charged by French dragoons that had crossed the bridge. The 16th Light Dragoon fell back in complete confusion and turned the wrong way, blocking both Ramsay's guns and Bock's intended charge zone. The Lancers of Berg, 15th Chasseurs, and Gendarmes then arrived in line towards the stream bed, which they found impassable. They quickly turned right, trotted over the bridge, turned left, and formed a line in front of Bock's heavy cavalry brigade. The Berg lancer squadron posted itself closest to the bridge, followed by the five squadrons of the 15th Hussars, and finally the four Gendarme squadrons. At 17:00, before the last two Gendarme squadrons had finished positioning themselves, Bock's Dragoons attacked in two lines. The first line of three squadrons was reeling back when the second line entered the melee. Just before this charge, the last two Gendarme squadrons had managed to place themselves in such a way as to attack both Dragoon lines on their right flank. Eight to ten minutes of bitter fighting ensued, overlooked by both armies on the surrounding heights. Bock's men retreated in disorder, followed by Anson's brigade. They soon became outflanked on both sides as more French dragoons came racing down upon them, causing the British cavalry to break in complete confusion. They finally rallied behind Halkett's two KGL infantry battalions as the Gendarmes, 15th Chasseurs, and Berg Lancers halted to also rally themselves. Boyer's Dragoons charged and broke Bock's dragoons a second time. Wellington, arriving on the field, then directed Halkett's squares to fire at the French Dragoons, which unsuccessfully charged the squares three times before pulling away. The arrival of French infantry then forced the Anglo-German force to retreat, but in good order. Cotton greatly distinguished himself by his \\"coolness, judgment, and gallantry.\\" The Allies lost 165 killed and wounded and 65 captured. The French lost between 200 and 300 casualties. Other sources state 250 killed and wounded for the Allies and 85 prisoners, five of which were officers, while the French had 7 killed and 134 wounded. One of them was Colonel Jean-Alexis B√©teille, who was left for dead on the field after receiving twelve sword wounds (eight to the head, one of which cracked his skull open, and four to his left hand). French surgeons managed to save him. Several months later he was made brigadier general and officer of the L√©gion d'honneur by Napoleon himself. Battle honours The German 1st and 2nd KGL Light battalions wore the \\"Venta del Pozo\\" battle honour until 1918 in their subsequent service with the Hanoverian and Prussian armies.

Lusader played all three outfield positions in his major league career, but saw the majority of his action as a right fielder. Lusader was born in Chicago, grew up in Florida and attended Twin Lakes High School in West Palm Beach. He attended the University of Florida, and in 1985 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the Tigers in the sixth round of the 1985 MLB Draft. As a rookie in 1987, Lusader compiled a .319 batting average in 23 games with a .489 slugging percentage, three doubles, a triple, a home run and eight RBIs. Lusader's average dropped to .063 in 16 games in 1988. In 1989, Lusader had career highs with 103 at bats, 15 runs, 26 hits, and four doubles. In 1990, he played in a career-high 45 games and had 16 RBIs. On September 8, 1990, Lusader tied a major league record by committing three errors in the outfield in a single inning. Fighting the sun and a soggy turf, Lusader became the eighth major league outfielder to accomplish the feat, the first in the American League since 1925. Lusader dropped a fly ball hit by Carlos Mart√≠nez for his first error, then overthrew home plate after a single by Daryl Boston for his second error. For the third error, he allowed the ball to go past him following a single by Ozzie Guill√©n. In April 1991, Lusader was placed on waivers by the Tigers, and he was claimed by the New York Yankees for $20,000. He appeared in 11 games for the Yankees in 1991.

This snake is also called Allen's snake, the striped swamp snake, the striped swampsnake, or simply the swamp snake. It is endemic to peninsular Florida.Smith HM, Brodie ED Jr (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. . 240 pp. (STRIPED SWAMP SNAKE, pp. 158-159). Although rarely seen due to its secretive behavior, it can be found in large numbers in wet areas, with densities approaching 1,300 snakes per hectare (525 snakes per acre).Godley JS (1980). \\"Foraging ecology of the striped swamp snake, Regina alleni, in Southern Florida\\". Ecological Monographs 50: 411-436. Etymology The specific name, alleni, is in honor of zoologist Joel Asaph Allen,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Regina alleni, p. 5). who collected the type specimen. Description The striped crayfish snake is of \\"small medium\\" size, in total length (including tail), with a heavy body.Conant, Roger (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. (hardcover), (paperback). (STRIPED SWAMP SNAKE Liodytes alleni, p. 152 + Plate 22 + Map 111). The stripes which contribute to its common name are indistinct and located on the dark dorsal side. The ventral side is yellow with some dark spots. The dorsal scales, which are arranged in 19 rows at midbody, are smooth on the body, with some keeled scales in the anal region. There is a clear sexual dimorphism with the females being the larger sex.Wright AH, Wright AA (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Two Volumes. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates, a division of Cornell University Press. 1,105 pp. (Size of adults, p. 7; Liodytes alleni, pp. 419-423, Figure 128, Map 35).Behler, John L.; King, F. Wayne (1979). The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Reptiles and Amphibians. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 743 pp. . (Striped Crayfish Snake, Regina alleni, p. 646 + Plate 510). The striped crayfish snake is very similar to the glossy crayfish snake (Liodytes rigida rigida), but has one row of spots on the underside, whereas the glossy crayfish snake has two spots. Natural habitat The striped crayfish snake is a semiaquatic snake and is regularly found in swamps and open wetlands with heavy plant growth, cypress swamps, saw grass prairies, swamps, and roadside ditches. The snake has adapted well to the beds of water hyacinth that has taken over many waterways. Although the species is aquatic, they are rarely seen in moving water. The snake is primarily found in Florida, they are commonly found east of the central panhandle and in southeastern Georgia. The northern range limit is near the Florida-Georgia border. Behavior and diet Striped crayfish snakes are active throughout the year except for the coldest months of winter. When they are active, they typically can be found among the roots of aquatic vegetation, and on land beneath logs or organic litter. They are active in still water during the day and probably at night. On cool days, they find sunny areas on land to bask in. The striped crayfish snake feeds primarily on crayfish. They use their coils to hold their prey while they consume them alive. Their teeth are small and very sharp, allowing them to grab and hold the hard outer covering of the crayfish. They typically swallow the crustacean tail first. Juveniles feed on insect larvae, most commonly the larvae of dragonflies and shrimp. Reproduction There is very little known about the reproduction of the striped crayfish snake. They probably mate during the spring season and the eggs hatch during the late summer or autumn. Clutches range in size from four to twelve eggs. Larger snakes usually produce more eggs than smaller snakes. Predators and defense Natural predators include great egrets, great blue herons, sandhill cranes, kingsnakes, cottonmouth snakes, large salamanders and river otters. When attacked or disturbed, the striped crayfish snake escapes into the water. The snake releases a strong odor from its scent glands when captured. They do not bite, but may thrash around vigorously when captured. Conservation Because the striped crayfish snake is dependent on a continuous and abundant supply of crayfish, any major changes to the crayfish supply, including destruction of the crayfish habitat, pollution and destruction of wetlands will be a threat to the survival of the striped crayfish snake. The species is not legally protected in Florida or George, but is considered a conservation concern. References External links * Further reading *Boulenger GA (1893).

He was born in the early or mid 13th century.  Life and place of Birth  Zartosht was born somewhere during the Khwarzmian Shah era and witnessed the Mongol invasion of Persia first hand. That he witnessed the Mongol era is shown by the laments over the Mongol destruction in his work the Ardaviraf Nama. He finished his Zaratusht-nama in 1278 A.D. Thus from the available sources, Zartosht Bahram was born in mid or early 13th century and was alive in the late 13th century. In the British manuscript of Zaratusht-nama held in the British museum, his birthplace has been mentioned as the city of Rayy in Persia which is now a suburb of modern Tehran in Persia.In the British museum manuscript: ŸÜÿßÿ∏ŸÖ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ≤ÿ±ÿßÿ™ÿ¥ÿ™ ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá ŸÜ€åÿ≤ ÿ≤ÿ±ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ™ ŸÜÿßŸÖ ÿØÿßÿ¥ÿ™Ÿá Ÿà ÿßÿ≥ŸÖ ŸæÿØÿ±ÿ≥ ÿ®Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÖ Ÿà ÿØÿ± ÿ®ŸÑÿØŸá ÿ±€å ÿ≥ÿß⁄©ŸÜ Ÿà ÿØÿ± ÿ≥ŸÜŸá 647 €åÿ≤ÿØÿ¨ÿ±ÿØ€å ÿß€åŸÜ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ŸÜÿ∏ŸÖ ŸÜŸÖŸàÿØŸá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ . On the other hand, the Persian scholar Mohammad-Taqi Bahar has mentions the Zartosht Bahram e Pazhdo's preface in his Ardavarifnama: My name is Zartosht, my father's name is Bahram the son of Pazhdo, .. we are from the people of khwaf in the area of Bizhan Abad which was built during the time of KeyKhusraw. Thus the poets ancestors came from Khwaf in Khorasan and he must have settled in Shahr-i-Rayy, which is now a suburb of modern Tehran.  Work  Two of the monumental works of Zartosht Bahram is the Zaratusht-nama (The book of Zoroaster) and the Ardiviraf-Nama (The book of Ardaviraf). Both books are composed in poetic verse. =Zaratusht-nama (The book of Zoroaster)= In the intro of this epic composed of poetry, Zaratusht Bahram writes: \\"I saw a work in Pahlavi (Middle Persian) letters that was in the possession of the Mobed of Mobedan (high priest of Zoroastrianism). In this book, the fate of the world, the lore of ancients, the interpretation of the Avesta, and the story of the birth of Zoroaster was written. There were not many people who had access to this important work, and the Mobed told me that since not many know this alphabet, it is important that you versify this work into (Modern) Persian poetry, so that many people may benefit from it and the pure religion may bestow its favor upon them. I became happy at the words of the Mobed and followed his command with a heart and soul full of happiness, and I felt asleep then (that night). The angel Sorush told me in a dream, when you become awake, versify the story of Zoroaster and make the soul of the prophet happy. I woke up a little bit afraid, and sleep did not come to me and in the morning I approached the priest and told him to recount the story. He recounted the story, and after I heard it from him, I proceeded in versifying it.\\" The Zaratusht-nama thus is based on old Zoroastrian literature and is uniquely written from a Zoroastrian perspective about the life and times of Zoroaster and his deeds. The Zaratusht-nama is an important literary work which contains approximately 90% pure Persian words. Synopsis The book starts with the praise of God and affirmation of his unity. According to the author, the most important principle, that is righteousness and rejection of falsehood is asked from God. The second section of the book describes the author's reason for versifying the Zaratushtnama. The author sees a book written in Middle Persian with Middle Persian script. He brings it to the Zoroastrian Mobed Mobedan and the Mobed reads a portion of the book for him. The Mobed complains that not too many people are not aware of this script anymore, and I am afraid that this story will disappear. It is better if it is brought to the New Persian script and language. In section 3, the author has a dream where Sorush, the Zoroastrian angel visits him and encourages him in his effort. Sorush tells him: In section 4, the author retells the story from the Mobed Mobedan: > When the world was bewildered by evil, there was no teacher or guide, nor > awareness of God, and the world was following the wishes of Ahiman, God > through his mercy, forgave them, and wanted to deliver them towards > righteousness. From the seed of Fereydun, there was a man named Purushasp, > his father was named Petrasp, who was the Grandfather of Zoroaster. > Zoroaster's mother was named Doghdovi and when she was five month pregnant > with Zoroaster, she had a dream. =Arda Viraf Nama (The book of Ardaviraf)= The story is about Arda Viraf, a Zoroastrian priest who takes a spiritual journey into heaven and hell. The Persian poem is based on the Middle Persian Book of Arda Viraf. Legacy Being an important Persian poet of Zoroastrian faith, Zartosht Bahram has brought down the most comprehensive biography of Zoroaster from a Zoroastrian point of view. He has also used many Middle Persian words Sources * Zartusht-i-Bahram b. Pajdu, Zaratusht-Nama (Le Livre De Zoroastre), ed.

History  After the defeat of the Egyptian forces in Palestine in 1948 , a modernization programme began. In 1949 the 2nd Infantry Division was formed and it compromised 3 Infantry Regiment and 1 Reconnaissance Regiment. However the division never participated in the Suez Crisis. The division's first engagement was in the North Yemen Civil War along the other Egyptian units there. Ahmed Ismail Ali commanded the division from 1957/58 (exact date unclear) to 1960. In 1965 the division was pulled back to Egypt to be upgraded, where it was replaced with Brigades instead of Regiments. = Six Day War, 1967 = Saad el-Shazly commanded the division in 1965‚Äì66. By June 1967, the division comprised the 10th Infantry Brigade, the 12th Infantry Brigade and the 51st Artillery Brigade. It defended the central sector of the Sinai Front at Abu-Ageila and Kusseima during the Six-Day War.Gawrych It occupied a heavily fortified strongpoint at Um-Katef/Abu Ageila, a thicket of artillery pieces, anti-tank guns, entrenched, surrounded by barbed wire and minefields, backed by a force of some 90 tanks secreted in concrete bunkers available for a counterattack. But the division commander, by that time Major General Sa'di Naguib, was absent. Kandil describes how he had been appointed by Field Marshal Amer, and was \\"reluctant to leave [Amer's] side\\". And Naguib had not delegated to the command on the spot any ability to act on his own initiative. Ariel Sharon was the overall Israeli commander who was to direct the assaults on the Egyptians in the area, supervising the 38th Division. After nightfall on 5 June, Israeli artillery began a barrage. Israeli tanks assaulted the northernmost Egyptian defenses and were largely successful, though an entire armoured brigade was stalled by mines, and had only one mine- clearance tank. Israeli infantrymen assaulted the triple line of trenches in the east. To the west, paratroopers commanded by Colonel Danny Matt landed behind Egyptian lines, though half the helicopters got lost and never found the battlefield, while others were unable to land due to mortar fire.Oren, p. 201Hammel 1992, p. 239 Those that successfully landed on target destroyed Egyptian artillery and ammunition dumps and separated gun crews from their batteries, sowing enough confusion to significantly reduce Egyptian artillery fire. Egyptian reinforcements from Jabal Libni advanced towards Um-Katef to counterattack, but failed to reach their objective, being subjected to heavy air attacks and encountering Israeli lodgements on the roads. Egyptian commanders then called in artillery attacks on their own positions. The Israelis accomplished and sometimes exceeded their overall plan, and had largely succeeded by the following day. The Egyptians took heavy casualties, while the Israelis lost 40 dead and 140 wounded. Yoffe's attack allowed Sharon to complete the capture of Um-Katef, after fierce fighting. The main thrust at Um-Katef was stalled due to mines and craters. After IDF engineers had cleared a path by 4:00 pm, Israeli and Egyptian tanks engaged in fierce combat, often at ranges as close as ten yards. The battle ended in an Israeli victory, with 40 Egyptian and 19 Israeli tanks destroyed. Meanwhile, Israeli infantry finished clearing out the Egyptian trenches, with Israeli casualties standing at 14 dead and 41 wounded and Egyptian casualties at 300 dead and 100 taken prisoner.Oren, p. 212 Thus the division was defeated in the Second Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967). = Yom Kippur War, 1973 = The 2nd Infantry Division fought again during the Yom Kippur War as part of the Egyptian Second Army. It was one of the Egyptian divisions that took part in Operation Badr, the successful crossing of the Suez Canal that began the war. It crossed in the Ismailia area. After the crossing, the five division-size bridgeheads consolidated themselves on Monday, October 8 into two army-size bridgeheads: the Second Army with its three divisions occupied El-Qantarah in the north to Deversoir in the south, while the Third Army with two divisions to the south. These two bridgeheads incorporated a total of 90,000 men and 980 tanks, dug in and entrenched. In common with the other four divisions, the 2nd Infantry Division arrayed, two infantry brigades in its forward echelon, and one mechanized infantry brigade in the second echelon, in accordance with the Operation Badr plan. In reserve was an armored brigade. The Egyptians had established anti-tank defences along their lines employing 9M14 Malyutka \\"Sagger\\" anti-tank guided missiles, RPGs, and B-10 and B-11 anti tank recoilless rifles.Gawrych, p.50Shazly, pp.235‚Äì236 At dawn a friendly fire incident occurred as the 2nd and 16th Divisions in Second Army were closing the gap between their bridgeheads. While cresting a ridge, two tank platoons from either division confronted each other at . The tank crews were so agitated that they opened fire immediately. Each platoon lost two of its three tanks to direct hits within minutes, and several men were killed.Shazly, pp.238‚Äì239 = Battle of Firdan = On October 8, General Avraham Adan's Armored Division was going to counterattack the 2nd and 16th Infantry Divisions of the second army and take over their lost positions on the east bank. Brigadier General Hassan Abu Sa'ada, commander of the 2nd Infantry Division prepared his division to halt the attack and defeat the Israelis. After the arrival of the Israeli division, it was obliterated (losing around 300 tanks at this battle and the later Israeli armored attacks according to Abu Saada's claim and documented pictures of their tanks) (Yaguri's Brigade and around 40 tanks of the two other Brigades) and Colonel Assaf Yaguri was captured. Jamal Hammad, the military historian wroteGamal Hammad, the military historian from his book Military Wars on the Egyptian Front. that (the decision of the commander of the second division was considered a new method to destroy the enemy, which is to attract his armored forces to a killing zone inside the head of the division bridge and allow it to penetrate the forward defense position and advance until a distance of 3 km from the channel .. The decision of the commander of the second infantry division - and on his personal responsibility - but the surprise in it was amazing, which helped in success ... and as soon as the tanks of the brigade entered the killing field, they were fired upon from all weapons under the orders of the commander of the second division, the infantry leader Hassan Abu Saada .. which turned the killing land into a kind of Hell .. and within minutes most of it was destroyed M of enemy tanks, and 8 intact tanks were seized, as was Colonel Assaf Yaguri, commander of the 1st Battalion Brigade of the 190th armored Netka Brigade. On the battle of Al-Firdan (Verdun Bridge), Major General Mohamed Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy, head of the Military Operations Authority, said that Israeli tanks rushed to penetrate Abu Sa\`da sites towards Al-Fardan Bridge. In order to reach the channel line, and the more Israeli tanks advanced, the more Adan - the commander of the division that belongs to the 190th Armored Brigade \\"Netka\\" - had hope of success ... The attacking force was surprised that it found itself inside a killing zone and the Egyptian fire opened against it from three sides at the same time in implementation of the Hassan plan Abu Saada .. And the greatest surprise was that the enemy tanks were being destroyed at a rapid rate by Egyptian tank fire, anti-tank weapons and artillery .. The Israeli tanks were advancing very strongly consisting of 35 tanks supported by Colonel Assaf Yaguri, one of the units that were leading the attack, and he was struck by terror. When he was wounded and thirty tanks were destroyed during a battle that lasted half an hour on the killing ground. Assaf Yaguri had no choice but to jump from the command tank and his crew to hide in one of the pits for several minutes, after which they were captured by the men of the second squad. This destroyed tank remained on the battlefield as a recording for everyone to watch after the war. He felt relieved when he reported to us at the operations center about the success of the battle of the second division led by Hassan Abu Saada .. I called him on the phone to congratulate him on the completion of his division and we exchanged a short talk praising the planning and praising the implementation .... I was happy with what I heard from him about morale Of the division forces and their insistence on defeating the enemy And about him, the late President Anwar Sadat says (that the one who performed this work was a leader of the new buds named Hassan Abu Saada) - from his book Searching for Self.

Cannington Manor is located west and north of Saskatchewan Highway 603. 5 townships The Colony is 16 kilometres southeast of Moose Mountain Provincial Park, and south of Moosomin. Captain Pierce established an agricultural college and attracted remittance men as students for ¬£100 a year. The intention of the college was to instruct these bachelor sons of wealthy families to farm and homestead in the last best west. The brothers Ernest, Billy and Bertie Beckton constructed \\"Didsbury\\", ranch house within Cannington Manor colony. The cultural and recreational life emulated English upper class society. Thoroughbred racing, polo matches, theatrical plays, fox hunting, billiards, soccer and tennis were all enjoyed by the colony students and settlers. This was a contrast to the neighbouring homesteaders who were barely eking out a living proving their land and making improvements to earn land title grants from the Dominion Government. Soon a dairy, a school / town hall, blacksmith, Moose Mountain trading company store, Harold Fripp flour mill, C.E. Phipps Land Titles Office, carpenter shop, Mitre hotel were built to support a burgeoning community which soon reached 200 residents. Demise of Colony Captain Pierce, the founder of the community died on June 20, 1888. C.E. Phipps established the land titles office here in 1889 and moved to Oxbow in 1891. Spencer Page was the colony's first teacher in 1889 before turning to politics in 1894. Louis Kent the second teacher in Cannington Manor started his duties in 1894 and passed on in 1896. Robert Bird the Moose Mountain trading company store keeper moved to B.C. in 1898. Ernest Maltby postmaster and his wife Mary arrived in 1892 moved in 1901 to B.C. In 1901 - 1902 the CPR regional branch line was constructed south of the village rather than through the village. During a time of travel by horseback this distance was detrimental to the growth of the community. The passing of the founder, a few years earlier, a drought and low grain prices soon made it unfeasible for settlers to continue the lifestyle at Cannington Manor.

After the election, Chambers remained active in Greenback politics in Texas until the party's demise in the late 1880s. He died at his home in Cleburne in 1895. Early life Barzillai Jefferson Chambers was born in 1817 in Montgomery County, Kentucky, the son of Walker Chambers and Talitha Cumi Mothershead Chambers. Chambers lived on his father's Kentucky farm for the first twenty years of his life. In 1837, he followed his uncle, Thomas Jefferson Chambers, to Texas. The elder Chambers, who had lived in Texas since 1830, had raised a regiment to join the Texas Revolution and commissioned his nephew as a captain and his aide-de-camp. After helping his uncle to recruit soldiers in Kentucky, the two departed for Texas but arrived too late to see action. Chambers was discharged from the Texas army in 1838 and remained in the state, becoming a surveyor in the southern part of the state. The next year, he was appointed deputy surveyor for north central Texas, between the Brazos and Trinity rivers. The area had little white settlement at the time, and Chambers \\"narrowly escaped Indian attacks on several occasions.\\" Chambers continued to work as a surveyor in the 1840s while also engaging in land speculation. By 1850, he was promoted to district surveyor; he had, by then, acquired 10,000 acres of land in Navarro and Johnson counties. He devoted some of the land to farming, but also donated some lots to Johnson County for the erection of the county seat, in Cleburne. He became a lawyer in 1860, but never developed a sizable law practice. Chambers married three times: first in 1852 to Susan Wood, who died the next year; secondly in 1854 to Emma Montgomery, who died in childbirth the next year; and finally in 1861 to Harriet Killough. Chambers had no children who survived infancy with the first two wives, but with his third wife he would have three children: Mary, Patrick, and Isabella. Business and political career After the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States in 1860, Chambers, a Democrat, served on two committees in Navarro County that drafted resolutions opposed to Lincoln and racial equality. He supported Texas's secession from the Union in 1861 and adhesion to the newly formed Confederacy, but, being 44 years old at the subsequent outbreak of the Civil War, did not immediately enlist. Although he was exempted from the Confederacy's military draft, Chambers thought the exemption unjust, and wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis to protest it. In 1864, he did enlist for six months in the 1st Regiment of Texas State Troops, but saw no action. After the war, Chambers returned to farming but also became a half-owner of Cleburne's only bank from 1871 to 1875. By that time, Chambers had the largest land holdings in Johnson County. He also actively promoted the Dallas and Cleburne Railroad, working unsuccessfully to get the railroad to make its stock available to all local citizens. Chambers's political opinions after the war were at first concerned with government debt. In an 1868 article in the Cleburne Chronicle, Chambers argued against all interest-bearing national debts, and for a general policy of inflationism. Running as a Democrat, he was elected an alderman of Cleburne and was a delegate to Texas's constitutional convention of 1875. The proposed constitution that emerged was primarily an attempt to reverse the changes made by Republicans during Reconstruction. Chambers opposed its adoption, not for that reason, but because \\"while taxation was unequally thrown upon property alone, unqualified suffrage was given to every man\\". He also opposed the homestead exemption, \\"which protect[s] the debtor class from the just demands of the creditor class.\\" Nevertheless, the constitution was adopted by a two-to-one majority. Greenback party In an 1880 cartoon in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, the Greenback party is ridiculed as a collection of disparate radicals. When the Democratic Party's platform did not endorse his inflationist views in 1876, Chambers quit the party. The new Greenback Party (sometimes called the Greenback-Labor Party,) had not yet begun to organize in Texas, but its positions better suited Chambers and he joined in 1877. The Greenbackers, in the words of one author, \\"anticipated by almost fifty years the progressive legislation of the first quarter of the twentieth century.\\" Their platform advocated an eight-hour work day, safety regulations in factories, and prohibition of child labor. Their most prominent position, however, and the one from which their name was derived, was support for the continued issuance of the greenback dollar. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized \\"greenbacks,\\" a new form of fiat money that was redeemable not in gold but in government bonds. The greenbacks had helped to finance the war when the government's gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies. When the crisis had passed, many in both parties, especially in the East, wanted to return the nation's currency to a gold standard as soon as possible. The Specie Payment Resumption Act, passed in 1875, ordered that greenbacks be gradually withdrawn and replaced with gold-backed currency beginning in 1879. At the same time, economic depression had made it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both gold and silver, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values. With neither major party willing to endorse inflation, some partisans of loose money joined the new Greenback faction. Chambers rose quickly in the new party's leadership, serving as a delegate to their state convention in July 1878. Initially a candidate for state land commissioner, Chambers withdrew his name in August of that year to allow former Republican Jacob Kuechler to win a unanimous nomination; he was nominated instead for a seat in the state legislature. Ten Greenbackers were elected to the legislature that year, but Chambers was not among them. During the campaign, Chambers published a pamphlet attacking the Democratic candidates and calling for Congress to create \\"a sufficient amount of paper money, making it equal to gold and silver, and full legal tender for all debts\\". While it did not help his own election, the pamphlet was widely circulated within the party and raised Chambers's profile among Greenbackers. 1880 election Greenback campaign ribbon from 1880 By 1879, the Greenback coalition had splintered, and Chambers became affiliated with the faction most prominent in the South and West, called the \\"Union Greenback Labor Party,\\" led by Marcus M. \\"Brick\\" Pomeroy. Pomeroy's faction was more radical and emphasized its independence, suggesting that Eastern Greenbackers were likely to \\"sell out the party at any time to the Democrats.\\" Chambers was chosen as a delegate to the Pomeroy faction's 1880 national convention in St. Louis. The 212 delegates nominated Stephen D. Dillaye of New York for President and Chambers for Vice President. Accepting the nomination, Chambers called for unity between the Greenback factions and restated his belief in the party's goals, and attacked bankers as \\"Huns and Vandals.\\" To further promote his views, he purchased a small newspaper, the Cleburne Avalanche, and spoke at the state convention in Texas in May 1880. The more Eastern-oriented faction of the Greenbacks, called the \\"National Greenback Party,\\" held its convention in Chicago that June, and Chambers attended along with others from the Pomeroy faction, hoping to heal the party split. The two factions resolved their differences and wrote a joint platform. The Greenbackers also agreed to admit forty-four delegates of the Socialist Labor Party. Dillaye stepped aside to allow the nomination of James B. Weaver of Iowa, a Civil War general and Congressman. Chambers was proposed for Vice President by the reunited party, as was Absolom M. West of Mississippi; Chambers was victorious on the first ballot, by 403 votes to 311. West moved that the nomination be made unanimous, which it was. Chambers gave speeches on his way back to Texas, castigating the banks and defending the admission of socialists to the convention as \\"simply a body of men enlisted in the cause of human rights.\\" In his official acceptance letter, he called for expansion of the currency, immigration restriction to help workingmen compete \\"with Chinese serf labor,\\" and the forfeiture of all unfulfilled railroad grants. On July 8, before reaching home, Chambers fell as he exited his train in Kosse, Texas, and broke two ribs. He was confined to bed for several weeks and considered withdrawing from the race, but decided against it. His efforts, however, were limited by his injuries, and his only contribution to the campaign was to publish his newspaper, renamed the Cleburne Greenbacker. Greenbackers had high hopes for the 1880 election, but were disappointed with the result: Weaver and Chambers won just over 300,000 votes (3.3% of the popular vote) and did not carry a single state in the electoral college. Post-election life Chambers remained active in politics after the 1880 election. He served as chairman of the Texas Greenback Party in 1882 as George Washington Jones received the party's endorsement for governor. He was unsuccessful, and Chambers worried that the party was becoming \\"disorganized and disintegrated beyond the hope of a successful rally.\\" In 1884, Jones ran again for governor and Chambers broke with him on the question of whether the state should lease public lands or let cattlemen use them without payment (Chambers favored the former option). He also criticized the party's presidential nominee that year, Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, for attacking monopolies without offering any suggestions on how to reform them. After the 1884 election, Chambers had little involvement in politics. The Greenback Party fell apart by 1888, but many of its ideas and members found a home in the People's Party, which arose in the early 1890s. Chambers made his last foray into politics in 1890 in two letters to the Southern Mercury, a newspaper of the Farmers' Alliance, in which he again condemned monopolies and corporations, and suggested that all laws creating them be repealed. He was encouraged by the growth of the People's Party, but old age and ill health kept him from being an active member. Chambers died at his home on September 16, 1895, and was buried in Cleburne Memorial Cemetery.

The families give their readiness to go to any part of the world, freely, trusting in Divine Providence, and receiving their destination in purpose-held meetings, called (convivences of the families), by the Responsible Team of the Neocatechumenal Way. Their sending usually takes place in the presence of the local Bishop in an official ceremony. In most cases their assignments and mission have been ratified by the Holy Fathers, since Pope John Paul II. The families in Mission come under the authority of the Ordinary of a Diocese in collaboration with the National Team responsible for the Neocatechumenal Way in that country. They are usually supported by diocesan missionary priests formed in the Redmptoris Mater Seminaries and Houses of Formation throughout the world. The families aim to be self sufficient, taking up paid work to pay for their living costs. Where possible, the children of these families attend the local Catholic schools. The families aim to become fully integrated into the Parish life and the culture of the city where they move to. Although the aim of the mission is to stay in their assignment for most of their life, they are not bound by religious vows and so remain free to end their mission if needed or to move to other territories if called to do so. Where the families in mission set down roots in the parishes and dioceses where they are sent, they contribute to the New Evangelization by their fidelity to Church Teaching and Tradition. They aim to bring a fresh and renewed spirit, being open to life and passing on a renewed spirit of the Catholic family. It is often the children of these families who are at the forefront of the mission work, through their simple integration into parish and school life. The work of missionary families is not easy. They are not immigrants. They often leave behind very successful and lucrative lives, including homes, jobs and careers. They sacrifice their securities, families, friends and familiar life for precarious lives in poorer countries. They often endure precarious situations and uncertainties. However, their fidelity to the Gospel is always attractive and is capable of bringing hope to those who need it most of all. Not all families are sent to what would be classed as less advantaged countries. In 2018 the Associated Press ran an article on a family from Spain serving in the United States. They were however serving in south Philadelphia which is not the most advantaged area of the city. On December 30, 1988, during a celebration of the Holy Mass with the Neocatechumenal Way, Pope John Paul II sent 72 families on mission for the first time to the whole world, encouraging them with the words: > The family is on mission. This mission is fundamental to all nations, to all > mankind: it is the mission of love and life, the witness of love and life. > Holy Church of God, you cannot fulfill your mission, you cannot accomplish > your task in the world if not by the family and its mission! Family in > mission, Trinity in mission! https://redemptorismateravignon.fr/en/our- > mission Since then many other families have been sent on mission. For example: * Pope Benedict XVI sent out two hundred families in mission on the 12th of January 2006 Discorso di papa Benedetto XVI nell'udienza concessa alle famiglie neocatecumenali in partenza per la missione (12 gennaio 2006). * Pope Francis sent out 250 missionary families on the 16th March 2016 https://www.catholicireland.net/pope-sends-250-neocatechumenal-way-families- mission/ There are currently thousands of families in mission around the world, in all six inhabited continents.

People like Colonel Dmitry Wozniesienski, a former officer of SMERSH, Col. Ko≈ºuszko Red Army officer, and many others. In 1943‚Äì1944, 100% of positions were filled at the IW by Soviet officers. The first group of Poles rushed in mid-1944‚Äîthere were probably 17, but took up the position of interpreters and other not significant positions. Should also pay attention to the ethnic origin of the officers who have spanned executive positions. Same thing was in civilian security service the Ministry of Public Security. When slowly Soviet officers were going away, freeing up space for the officers, \\"Polish\\", which is a very relative concept because of their origin. For example, in August 1945, at Deputy of the Head of Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army, Officers were called \\"Polish\\": Col. Anatoly (Natan) and Colonel Eugene Feygin Zadrzy≈Ñski (both Jewish). In December 1945, Colonel Peter Ko≈ºuszko was recalled to the Soviet Union, and was replaced by Col. Jan Rutkowski (pre-war communist of Jewish origin.) Also, his successor, Colonel Stefan Kuhl, was of Jewish origin, as well as the heads of four of the five departments (sections). And so: *Section I: counterintelligence protection of the Army Staffs led by Col. Alexander Kokoshin. *Section II: elimination of enemy spies, work control and Instructors led by Col. Ignatius Flint. *Section III: counterintelligence operation targeting led by Col. Jerzy Fonkowicz, he had very close contacts with high-ranking Smersh officers, the NKVD foreign intelligence service, and also the soviet Military Intelligence the GRU, but he was nor conformed as an agent. *Section IV: Investigations, led by Col. Wladyslaw Kochan. *Section V: Operations - observation, searches, arrests, led by Colonel Vincent Klupi≈Ñski. With only the aforementioned Colonel Kochan was of Polish origin. The actions of so-called military information, additionally the tasks for which it was established that is, military counterintelligence, it rely consisted more on the fight against the opponents of the communist regime in the Polish Army. IW chased prewar officers, officers and soldiers of the Home Army, and other key independent organizations. Organizations that were loyal and subject to the orders of the Polish government on exile in London. Starting from mid 1944‚Äì1945 IW carried out purges in the army, with apply proven soviet methods, like arrests, torture and show trials. With these actions, IW was even more cruel than the Gestapo, Nazi political police. After 1956 and under the new political conditions in Poland, the existing military counterintelligence which in 1956 was The Main Directorate of Information with in Ministry of National Defence (G≈Ç√≥wny ZarzƒÖd Informacji Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej), was dismantled in January 1957.  Creation of WSW  The WSW (Wojskowa S≈Çu≈ºba Wewnƒôtrzna), the Internal Military Service was established in order number 01/1957 by the Minister of National Defense, a position occupied then by General (from 1963 Marshal of Poland) Marian Spychalski, a soldier and communist politician. He was born in 1906 and was a communist during the World War II, a high-ranking officer active in the communist resistance in Poland. He was later appointed the chief of General Staff of the People's Guard, which after a reorganization during the second half of 1944 became one of the main departments in the People's Army. Also the order of Chief of General Staff of the People's Army of Poland a position occupied then by Soviet officer General Jerzy Bordzi≈Çowski, also Deputy Defence Minister. His order No. 0013 allow to disband the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army so-called Informacja Wojskowa (Military Information). The name indicates that this was a Military Intelligence formation, a lot of people are still convinced that it was. But is not truth. As the main article Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army indicates that it was counterintelligence and political police formation. = Responsibilities and supervision = WSW was responsible for typical military counterintelligence and military police duties. They were: *Detection of espionage activity in Polish People's Army. *Elimination of detected espionage activity. *Detection of Political sabotage in Polish People's Army. *Elimination of detected Political sabotage. *Detection of Polish People's Army soldiers who carry out terrorist attacks. *Detection of officers and soldiers who carry out sabotage in units of Polish People's Army. *Elimination of these two threats. *Detection and elimination created by the soldiers and officers of illegal political alliances in the Polish People's Army. *Counterintelligence Supervision of the Polish Navy. *Counterintelligence Supervision of Air Force and Air Defence of the Country. *Protection of Minister of National Defence and the closest family. *Counterintelligence Supervision of factories working for the Ministry Of National Defense, such as the production of tanks and other weapons for the needs of the Army, Navy, Air Force etc. *Maintaining discipline in the Polish People's Army. *Conducting investigation of criminal cases in which suspects were officers or soldiers of the Polish People's Army. *Conducting prosecutions of soldiers who deserted or did not return from a pass (home live). *Overseeing the recruitment of Polish People's Army. The Military Internal Service was not part of the General Staff. Operating separately from the General Staff the Military Internal Service (WSW) had a larger field for maneuvers. WSW/MIS was a part of the Ministry of National Defence as one of its departments. Exact name of that department was - Szefostwo Wojskowej S≈Çu≈ºby Wewnƒôtrznej which meant Central Command Authority of the Military Internal Service. As a part of Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland (MON), Military Internal Service was monitored and subject to the orders of one of the vice ministers of National Defence, or to the first Deputy (vice minister) of Minister of National Defence. = WSW Chiefs = General Teodor Kufel as a chief of Military Internal Service, 1972. The first head of WSW was born in 1903, Colonel and later General Aleksander Kokoszyn, a Belarusian. Pre-war communist and graduate of NKVD school in Smolensk. During the war years was working in secret Polish Workers' Party paper and copy shop (Gwardzisty), were in 1942 was arrested by Gestapo and send to one of the concentration camps. After the war he returned to Poland and began working together with his wife in the notorious GZI WP the military counterintelligence, were in December 1956 he became the head of GZI and then the Chief of Military Internal Servise. Doing his time as an Internal Military Service head, the WSW had lost the look as effective and notorious counterintelligence service as the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army GZI was. Kokoszyn left his position in November 1964 and was replaced by his former deputy General Teodor Kufel, who start as an acting WSW Chief. Teodor Kufel born in 1920, later in 1954 the graduate of KGB school in Moscow. From beginning he was involved in secret service activities. Doing the war he was involved in Warsaw Uprising. Then after the war he was working in Police (Milicja or MO), and from 1953 for the civilian Special Services the Ministry of Public Security (MBP). Between 1954 and 1955 Kufel attend KGB school in Moscow and after his come back start working in Militsiya General Headquarters in Warsaw. Three years later Kufel was moved to military counterintelligence, Internal Military Service, as a deputy head of first Directorate responsible for counterintelligence, and in 1964 he became WSW Chief and held this post for 14 years till 1979 when General Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak become his successor. Born in 1925 Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak was long time military counterintelligence officer, first working in Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (GZI), to become head of counterintelligence for one of the infantry divisions and then one of the Military District and later head of counterintelligence for the Polish Navy. In 1967 Kiszczak become Kufel's deputy. But three years later he became the head of military intelligence which was then ZarzƒÖd II Sztabu Generalnego Wojska Polskiego (2nd Directorate of General Staff of the Polish Army). After seven years as an it head, in 1979 Kiszczak come back to WSW to take over after Kufel. Again he was moved in 1981, this time to the civilian branches of secret service, he became minister and took over the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ministerstwo Spraw Wewnƒôtrznych) or MSW, witch this position Kiszczak had the notorious S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa (SB) under his control. After General Kiszczak left WSW he was replace witch General Edward Poradko. Born in 1924 Poradko had almost the same military past as Kiszczak. After the war he joint the military counterintelligence and was working for long time in the GZI. Then was moved military intelligence and took over the strategic intelligence. In 1981 after Kiszczak left the WSW he come back to take over as a head. The next and last head of WSW was General Edmund Bu≈Ça. There are speculations that gen. Edmund Bu≈Ça had ordered to copy lists of WSW Informants and agents and sent it to Moscow, to KGB's Third Main Directorate, and some of them to GRU. Bu≈Ça is also responsible for many other things. In the 1980s, the Military Internal Service was very much involved in the fight against the democratic opposition Solidarity, etc. Almost all of the operational documents from those years have been burned, (in 1988 11 tons and latter another 5) all of this actions were controlled by general Bula and supervised by Colonel Mieczys≈Çaw Kacprzyk. But the order to destroy of these documents, had to come from a higher level, it came from General's W. Jaruzelski and Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak. From 1957 to 1990 the commanders of WSW were: *Gen. Aleksander Kokoszyn - 01/10/1957 ‚Äì 11/14/1964 *Gen. Teodor Kufel - (act) 11/14/1964 ‚Äì 06/24/1965 *gen. Teodor Kufel - 06/24/1965‚Äì1979 *Gen. Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak - 1979‚Äì1981 *Gen. Edward Poradko - 1981‚Äì1986 *Gen. Edmund Bu≈Ça - 08/15/1986 ‚Äì 08/1990 = Mazur Commission and WSW activities = The WSW was much different from its predecessor. During the transition from the Military Information to Military Internal Service, a special commission was established, so-called Mazur Commission. Its task was to check the activities of former Military Information, and an indication of the officers who showed cruelty to detainees doing the investigations. The results of the commission have been classified and have been hidden from the general public till 1999, when one of the major newspapers (Gazeta Wyborcza) had printed pieces of it. = Organization = During the beginning Internal Military Service was based on two main wings, first was operational counterintelligence, and second for investigate and safety task's. The each wing were supervised by WSW Chef Deputies. Deatel WSW organization was: *First Directorate - military counterintelligence Responsible for counter-espionage protection of Army's structure and its unit‚Äôs and important military infrastructure and installations. First Directorate consisted of four Sections. ::*1st Section: protection of military secrets, confidentiality and prevention ::*2nd Section: Offensive counterintelligence, carrying out recruitment of secret informants in the ranks of Polish Army, Navy, and Air Force.

The POSO was closed in 2003 when its assets were sold to the Quebec-based Desjardins Group cooperative of caisses populaires (credit unions) to form Desjardins Credit Union. In 2011, Desjardins Credit Unions in Ontario were transferred to Meridian Credit Union.\\"Desjardins Credit Union to join forces with Meridian\\", Meridian Credit Union news release, March 11, 2011  History  The Savings Office was created by the United Farmers of Ontario government of Premier Ernest C. Drury to provide loans to farmers and other small borrowers who traditionally had limited access to credit, as well as to offer savings accounts paying interest on small deposits, something Canadian chartered banks at the time did not do. POSO's authority to make loans was withdrawn by Premier Howard Ferguson's Conservative government that took office in 1923, and the institution's operations were effectively reduced to that of a government-run savings bank, offering savings, demand-deposit and term-deposit accounts at interest rates slightly higher than those available from commercial banks. At the time of its closure, POSO had twenty-eight branches serving about 50,000 customers, approximately 100,000 accounts with deposits totalling about $CAD2.8B, and was responsible for coordinating the sale and distribution of Ontario Savings Bonds.  Sale and closure  In the provincial budget of 2001, Ontario finance minister Jim Flaherty signalled the government's intention to sell POSO's assets to the private sector, announcing that the Province was \\"getting out of the banking business\\" as part of the government's privatization program to end \\"wasteful activities that could be eliminated\\". Critics, most notably the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, the provincial public-sector union that represented POSO's two hundred employees, objected that the sale was ideologically motivated. The union noted that POSO turned an annual profit of about $10 million, and that, as POSO's deposits went to Ontario's consolidated revenue fund, from which they could be loaned to the government at rates below those available from private lenders, the government would be increasing its borrowing costs at a time when its stated objective was eliminating the province's budget deficit. An unsuccessful petition campaign was mounted to attempt to convince the government to abandon its plans for the sale, but the assets were sold to the Desjardins credit union and POSO ceased operations on April 1, 2003.

It can be a small-scale, multi-use facility, combining a sitting area, tot lot, playground, park, and community garden, designed and constructed on one or more vacant lots by residents, volunteer professionals, and youth work teams. The term \\"neighborhood commons\\" was first widely used by landscape architect, educator, and psychologist Karl Linn, who guided the creation of many such spaces during the 1960s through 1980s, primarily in the northeastern United States.  Karl Linn and community design centers  While teaching at the University of Pennsylvania in 1960, Linn and his students began to provide landscape design service to the residents of low-income African-American and Latino neighborhoods, helping them acquire materials and the assistance of volunteer work teams to construct neighborhood commons. Linn recruited volunteer professionals such as artists, architects, landscape architects, social scientists, and lawyers to add their skills to the projects and mentor the students. The neighborhood commons were built as celebrations of community in the spirit of \\"urban barnraising.\\" The students formed a Design Corps that served as a model for the Domestic Peace Corps (VISTA). In 1961, with growing demand for their service, Linn established the Neighborhood Renewal Corps Nonprofit Corporation of Philadelphia, a community design center in landscape architecture. In 1962 he created a similar organization in Washington, D.C. One of their first projects was a \\"land bank\\" survey to identify vacant lots with the potential to become neighborhood commons. For the next 25 years while teaching at prominent colleges and universities, Linn guided or inspired into being numerous neighborhood commons. He worked hard to secure municipal support for these environmental self-help projects. In Philadelphia the work of the Neighborhood Renewal Corps received a lot of support and was gradually taken over by the city's Land Utilization Program. Unfortunately the focus shifted from involving residents in creating neighborhood commons to city crews constructing \\"vest-pocket parks.\\" These parks, although much admired by design critics, were not perceived as belonging to the community and were frequently subjected to graffiti and vandalism. Linn envisioned a neighborhood commons in every residential block as the physical framework for the development of a new kind of extended-family living based on mutual aid among neighbors and intergenerational support. Later in his career he observed that neighborhood commons in community gardens were most likely to be used and cared for since the gardeners go there regularly to attend to their plots. Many of these projects are described in Building Commons and Community by Karl Linn, published by New Village Press in 2007.

He is notable for managing Australian band Powderfinger and organising Splendour In The Grass. He is also Managing Director of Dew Process, Create-Control and Secret Service Music Company. Early life and education Piticco was born an only child to Fernando and Carmel Piticco in Brisbane, Australia. His father was an Italian immigrant who had relocated to Australia at a young age and founded a construction business in Brisbane and his mother was employed part-time in nursing and education. Piticco attended Petrie Terrace State School while growing up and later attended Kelvin Grove State High. Career After leaving high school, Piticco started working with his father at the family construction business. Piticco then moved onto employment as a steel salesperson for Boral Limited. It was during this period that Piticco was asked to manage Powderfinger. The band sought the assistance of a lawyer to devise a management contract that determined a six-way split for any money that was earned by Powderfinger beyond the actual songwriting‚Äîthe band continued working with Piticco after the contract lapsed, but did not bother to create another contract, and this arrangement lasted for the majority of Powderfinger's 20-year career. Piticco placed at number 11 in The Australian newspaper's 2012 \\"Top 50\\" list of influential Australians in the \\"Arts\\" field, In addition to appearing several times in the Top 5 AMID Power 50 Pittico is the founder of Secret Service Artist Management, which manages four Australian musical acts: Bernard Fanning, The Grates, Powderfinger and Mosman Alder. The company previously managed Magic Dirt, Yves Klein Blue, Dan Brodie, Turtlebox and Not From There. Co-founded by Piticco with his partners Jessica Ducrou and Kristy Rosser, Secret Sounds Connect are the exclusive commercial rights agents for Australia's top festivals including Splendour in the Grass; St Jerome's Laneway Festival; Falls Festival; Fuzzy Events (Listen Out, Harbourlife, Field Day); and Southbound Festival. Festivals and touring Secret Sounds promotes the tours of several international artists in Australia, including The Strokes, Mumford & Sons, London Grammar, Foster The People, James Blake, Mark Ronson, The Flaming Lips, Blur and many more. In 2007, Piticco co-promoted the \\"Across the Great Divide Tour\\", a tour headlined by popular Australian bands, Powderfinger and Silverchair. The carbon neutral tour promoted reconciliation in Australia and contributed to the reduction of the 17-year gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. In 2010, Piticco co-promoted the farewell tour of Powderfinger that signified the completion of the band's career. The \\"Sunsets Farewell Tour\\" consisted of performances in 34 cities and towns around Australia, after 300,000 tickets were sold. Piticco was also a producer for the band's final commercial DVD, Sunsets Farewell Tour, directed by Gregor Jordan. The farewell tour eventually grossed A$30 million. Secret Service, along with Byron Bay's Village Sounds, are the co-promoters of Splendour in the Grass, a live music festival held annually in Byron Bay, New South Wales, Australia, since 2001. The festival was temporarily held in Queensland, Australia for a number of years and eventually returned to Byron Bay. Piticco and associates purchased a site in the North Byron Parklands to secure a permanent location for the festival prior to the 2013 edition. In September 2012, Piticco announced he would become co-promoter, alongside Splendour in the Grass colleague Ducrou, of the Falls Music and Arts Festival. The announcement came shortly after the resignation of previous staff members Naomi Daly and Carmella Morgan. Piticco expanded the festival to a third location, Byron Bay, in 2013. Record labels In 2002, Piticco started Dew Process, an independent record label based in Brisbane, Australia. Dew Process' roster includes London Grammar, Bernard Fanning, Mumford & Sons, James Vincent McMorrow, Sarah Blasko, The Living End, The Hives,The Grates, Bluejuice, The Panics, Jebediah, Last Dinosaurs, Art of Sleeping, Kingswood, Seeker Lover Keeper, Little May and Tkay Maidza. In addition to the label, Dew Process Publishing was founded in 2008 and represents the publishing copyrights of Powderfinger, Art Of Sleeping, and Last Dinosaurs. In 2012, Piticco launched another record label, Create/Control. Create Control has released music from The Smashing Pumpkins, Cold War Kids, The Jungle Giants, Metric and is the Australian distributor of both the Mute Records and Downtown Records catalogues. Hospitality Piticco opened the restaurant and bar Popolo in South Bank, Brisbane in 2011. Piticco's business partners are restaurateur Andrew Baturo, Brian Quinn and Denis Sheahan, Powderfinger's former tour manager. The Gresham Bar was opened in Brisbane's Queen Street in late 2013. The building in which the bar is located was initially designed for the Queensland National Bank in 1881, and was completed by Queensland Colonial Architect Francis Drummond Greville Stanley in 1885. In 2015, The Gresham Bar was the recipient of several hospitality awards: Australian ‚ÄòBar of the Year‚Äô; Qld ‚ÄòBar of the Year‚Äô both awarded at the Australian Bar Awards and Gourmet Travellers‚Äô \\"Bar of the Year‚Äô.

The information can consist of web pages, images, audio files, or another type of document. Various techniques exist for research on these engines.  Types of search  = Audio search from text = Text entered into a search bar by the user is compared to the search engine's database. Matching results are accompanied by a brief description of the audio file and its characteristics such as sample frequency, bit rate, type of file, length, duration, or coding type. The user is given the option of downloading the resulting files. = Audio search from image = The Query by Example (QBE) system is a searching algorithm that uses content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Keywords are generated from the analysed image. These keywords are used to search for audio files in the database. The results of the search are displayed according to the user preferences regarding to the type of file (wav, mp3, aiff‚Ä¶) or other characteristics. Above: a sound A waveform Below: a sound A spectrogram = Audio search from audio = In audio search from audio, the user must play the audio of a song either with a music player, by singing or by humming to the computer microphone. Subsequently, a sound pattern, A, is derived from the audio waveform, and a frequency representation is derived from its Fourier Transform. This pattern will be matched with a pattern, B, corresponding to the waveform and transform of sound files found in the database. All those audio files in the database whose patterns are similar to the pattern search will be displayed as search results  Design and algorithms  A spectrogram of the sound of a violin. The target zone of a song scanned by Shazam. Audio search has evolved slowly through several basic search formats which exist today and all use keywords. The keywords for each search can be found in the title of the media, any text attached to the media and content linked web pages, also defined by authors and users of video hosted resources. Some search engines can search recorded speech such as podcasts, though this can be difficult if there is background noise. Around 40 phonemes exist in every language with about 400 in all spoken languages. Rather than applying a text search algorithm after speech-to-text processing is completed, some engines use a phonetic search algorithm to find results within the spoken word. Others work by listening to the entire podcast and creating a text transcription. Applications as Munax, use several independent ranking algorithms processes, that the inverted index together with hundreds of search parameters to produce the final ranking for each document. Also like Shazam that works by analyzing the captured sound and seeking a match based on an acoustic fingerprint in a database of more than 11 million songs. Shazam identifies songs based on an audio fingerprint based on a time-frequency graph called a spectrogram. Shazam stores a catalogue of audio fingerprints in a database. The user tags a song for 10 seconds and the application creates an audio fingerprint. Once it creates the fingerprint of the audio, Shazam starts the search for matches in the database. If there is a match, it returns the information to the user; otherwise it returns a \\"song not known\\" dialogue. Shazam can identify prerecorded music being broadcast from any source, such as a radio, television, cinema or music in a club, provided that the background noise level is not high enough to prevent an acoustic fingerprint being taken, and that the song is present in the software's database.

He pitched as a fifth and sixth-string starter for the BayStars rotation during his early career, with a career-high 9 wins in . He was traded to the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes in after pitching in a career-high 62 games in with a 4.50 ERA as a reliever in his final year with the BayStars. He became the closer for the Buffaloes midway through 2004, and ended the year with 2 wins and 10 saves with a 5.18 ERA. However, the Buffaloes team was disbanded during the off-season, and Fukumori was handed over to the newly created Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in a distribution draft. He recorded the first save in history for the Eagles on April 13 against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, and was the only pitcher to not let up a run in the team's epic 0-26 loss to the Chiba Lotte Marines in the second game of the season. Fukumori was relegated to setup duty at the start of in favor of Shinichiro Koyama, but returned to his closing role early in the year, pitching 26 straight innings without giving up a run in the first half of the season. This earned him his first appearance in the Japanese all-star game. However, his pitching quickly deteriorated after the all-star break, and he was relegated to setup duty again after blowing several save opportunities. He pitched decently as a reliever, and returned to his closing role again on September 22 with a save against the Seibu Lions. He made two more consecutive saves, ending the season with a career-best 2.17 ERA and a career-high 21 saves. Fukumori continued his success in the closing role during early , but dropped down during the interleague games in June. He made his second appearance at the Japanese all-star game, but admitted that he had been pitching with pain in his right elbow, and was removed from the active roster after the all-star break to receive surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow. He spent the rest of the season in rehab. Fukumori declared free-agency on November 7, 2007, and began negotiating with both Japanese teams and major league teams on November 13, 2007. = Texas Rangers = On December 13, 2007 it was reported that he had agreed to a two-year $3 million deal with the Texas Rangers.Fukumori, Texas Rangers agree to 2-year deal ‚Äì Dallas Morning News He made an appearance at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington the following day to officially announce his move to the major leagues. Fukumori was released by the Rangers on May 12, , after having pitched extremely poorly in four games. It was the end of his Major League Baseball career. = Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles = On June 13, , the Texas Rangers released Fukumori so that he could sign with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of the Japanese Pacific League. Pitching style Fukumori throws a fastball, shootball, and forkball with varying degrees of success. He is also one of the few Japanese pitchers to have experimented with a knuckle curve. His fastball only reaches in the low 90 mph range, and he rarely displays good control of any of his pitches. His shootball comes in at a similar velocity as his fastball, and his forkball can be devastating at times.

It is among the last remaining historical Portland hotels such as the Benson Hotel (opened 1912), Imperial Hotel (built 1894), and Governor Hotel (built in 1909 as the Seward Hotel and now the Sentinel Hotel). The Heathman Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, as the New Heathman Hotel. History =Construction, heyday, and decline= The original Heathman Hotel in Portland OR, one block away from the current structure, was built at the intersection of Park and Salmon streets in 1926 by George Heathman, at a cost of $1 million. Wealthy lumber barons and railroad magnates, politicians, and upper-class investors of the day wanted a hotel that would fit their social station and demand for comfort and excellence. It stood 11 stories tall and offered 300 rooms. Because of the success of the first hotel, Heathman immediately started work on a sister hotel a block away. The New Heathman Hotel was completed in 1927. It was a 10-story concrete structure faced with brick. The decorative details were designed in the Jacobean Revival style by the Portland architectural firm of DeYoung and Roald. The second story and upper-floor windows were trimmed in stone, and the lobby's dark-hued paneling extended to the mezzanine, where light flooded through tall, arched windows. Acanthus leaves decorated the mezzanine's plaster columns and ceiling trim. The hotel's entrance was on the Salmon Street side (where it remained until 1984). The building of the New Heathman was Portland's largest construction project to that date, employing 1,200 workers, all of whom were invited to celebrate at the pre-opening party. A formal opening occurred on December 17, 1927, marking the end of seven months of work. When the New Heathman was ready, Governor I. L. Patterson and Mayor George Luis Baker made dedication speeches. Radio station KOIN featured live band and orchestral pieces. Portland city commissioners joined with the business community to pay tribute. The Oregon Journal described the Heathman as \\"Portland's newest and most modern hotel\\" and wrote, \\"Its planning, construction and general appointments are as modern as human ingenuity and talent could possibly make it\\", and that it was located on \\"Broadway ‚Ä¶ ablaze with theatre marquees, restaurants and shops.\\" The hotel in 2014, viewed looking south on Broadway In 1927, Broadway was called Portland's \\"Great White Way,\\" and was the focal point of downtown's entertainment center. Large, boldly colored marquee lights surrounded the hotel. On the eve of construction, Heathman announced plans to put in a ground floor coffee shop that was designed to be the largest coffee shop in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. KOIN moved from the old Heathman to the new Heathman on December 17, 1927. On September 22, 1932, KOIN acquired a sister station, KALE. KALE moved into the KOIN studio complex in 1933. With an additional station, more studio space was needed. Between 1933 and 1939, the mezzanine of the New Heathman was modified several times to accommodate the stations. The biggest change was the addition of the north‚Äìsouth wall and several dividing partitions to create offices along the east side of the building. Studio A and Studio B at the south end were also altered. By 1940 the major structural changes were finished. The studios were then described as \\"the finest broadcast facility in the country.\\" In 1944, KALE moved out of the New Heathman when KOIN was sold. When KOIN joined the television era in 1953, it required development of larger quarters still and finally left its radio studios at the New Heathman in 1955 to join its TV sister station. The New Heathman's coffee shop eventually closed as business diminished. The space was temporarily used as a political campaign headquarters, then sat empty until the hotel's renovation in 1983. The area that is now the hotel's entrance once housed a drug store and gift shop. The drug store gained fame as Portland's first 24-hour pharmacy. George Heathman died at age 49, less than three years after the New Heathman was completed. His wife, Katherine, and their two children remained active in the hotel industry and retained an interest in operations of the New Heathman until the early 1960s. Harry, George's son, managed the hotel until shortly before his death in 1962. A 1956 print advertisement for the Heathman hotels In the 1950s, much of the business and entertainment in Portland's downtown left for the suburbs. By the late 1960s, Broadway had lost most of these businesses. In the next decade, new city leaders recognized the changes and sought to convince major retail stores to keep their operations in the heart of downtown, and to even build new locations. As the city redeveloped the downtown area, it attempted to reintroduce music and theater on Broadway. A performing arts center was developed in the old Paramount Theatre (now called The Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall) located next door to the New Heathman. The site's development and architectural design plans were drawn with the help of the city, private investors, concerned citizens, and artists. The Portland Center for Performing Arts Area Development Plan noted in 1982 that the location and development of the New Heathman made its condition crucial to the success of the adjacent Paramount Concert Hall. The Heathman Hotel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in February 1984, under its old name, the New Heathman Hotel. At the time the building was nominated for the NRHP, it was noted that \\"interior fixtures, facilities and furnishings are presently ill maintained, inadequate and outdated.\\" The nomination also said that in 1983, \\"much of the interior spaces in the New Heathman Hotel are unoccupied.\\" =The Second Renovation= Detail view of upper floors The New Heathman's importance to the neighborhood appealed to developers, so by autumn of 1984 a two-year and $16 million renovation of the building was completed, with the \\"New\\" prefix removed from the name, as the original hotel had long since been renamed. The Heathman's public spaces were remodeled in new natural materials like marble and teak brought in by Portland architect Carter Case and interior designer Andrew Delfino. Then-owner Mark Stevenson had the original exterior and eucalyptus-paneled Tea Court restored. Above the Tea Court, a 100-year-old crystal chandelier that was once used in the U.S. Embassy in Czechoslovakia was 18th-century paintings by French landscape artist Claude Lorrain were installed and remains to this day. The renovated guest rooms were furnished in 18th‚Äì20th-century styles of Biedermeier, Ming, Empire, and Regency. As part of this remodeling, the hotel's main entrance was relocated from Salmon Street to Broadway, in support of new city design guidelines calling for major building entrances to be located on major streets. The Stevenson family sold the hotel and the name to the Rim Corporation of Modesto, California, in 2000. Local restaurant chain McCormick & Schmick's took over management of the Heathman's restaurant; Rim announced it would adopt the \\"Heathman\\" name for its line of upscale, boutique hotels. The purchase price was reported as being \\"in the neighborhood\\" of $25 million. In October 2007, a new Heathman Hotel opened in Kirkland, Washington, with 91 rooms. LaSalle Hotel Properties bought the Heathman in December 2014 for $64.3 million. Pebblebrook Hotel Trust purchased the Heathman Hotel November 30, 2018 and brought Provenance Hotels to manage it. Soon thereafter, the hotel underwent a complete hotel renovation aspiring to introduce a semi-formal, luxury, travel experience authentic to Portland, OR. The total cost of renovation was approximately $20million. Hotel amenities The hotel's library The Heathman's motto is \\"Where Service is Still an Art\\". The hotel is known for having doormen dressed in English Beefeater costumes. The entrance also features a bronze sculpture of Zelda, an English bulldog from Portland, who is also dressed in a Beefeater costume. The sculpture, which includes a dog bowl filled with fresh water, was donated by Banfield Pet Hospital in 2010, and depicts the star of the \\"Zelda Wisdom\\" line of greeting cards. Travel + Leisure placed the Heathman on its 500 Best Hotels in the World list in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2015. In 2011, Food & Wine listed the Heathman as one of the 21 most haunted restaurants and hotels in America. ;Support of the arts The Heathman acquired several original artworks at the time of the 1980s remodel and launched a campaign of support for the visual arts. The hotel's collection has included 250 original paintings, photographs, and works on paper, with a focus on American artists, and particularly artists local to the Northwestern United States. Prints from Andy Warhol's Endangered Species lithograph series are found on most floors, and one room specifically pays tribute to Warhol in its interior design. Visual art exhibits that change seasonally can be viewed on the mezzanine. These exhibits are curated by Portland's Elizabeth Leach Gallery. The Heathman also has a library on the mezzanine level containing a large collection of books signed by authors who have been guests at the hotel. =Restaurant= The Heathman Restaurant & Bar was run by Houston, Texas-based Landry's, Inc. It was known for French-influenced Pacific Northwest cuisine, and was considered one of Portland's top restaurants, earning four stars from the Forbes Travel Guide in 2014. In 2003, while the restaurant was under McCormick & Schmick's management, Anthony Bourdain reported in The New York Times on a special all- offal menu at the Heathman created in his honor. In 2016 the restaurant was reopened as Headwaters at the Heathman, or simply Headwaters, after a 6-month renovation. Run by Chef Vitaly Paley, Headwaters specializes in seafood and Northwest cuisine.

Travestis emerged as a distinct social group in the 1970s. Terminology Travestis' feminine gender expression typically includes feminine dress, language, and social roles. Travestis may modify their bodies with industrial silicone injections, breast implants, or estrogen- and/or progesterone-based hormone therapy. Liquid silicone became popular among South American travestis in the 1980s. An old understanding in South America, carried through by the official psychiatry diagnoses formed mostly by the understanding of European and North American professionals and academics, is that there is a dichotomy between travesti and transsexual, in which the former group does not desire surgery to modify one's genitals, whilst the latter one does. Nevertheless, such conception of the differences between travesti and transsexual has become disputed, as this invalidates the identities of many travestis and trans women alike, measuring a \\"valid identity\\" by one's degree of dysphoria and body modification, rather than self-identification. This issue is criticized in Brazilian trans circles as , particularly when affirmed within the group by fellow trans people. Travestis might identify under any sexual orientation (including lesbian) identity, under the assumption of the \\"defining feature\\" of their identity being either their gender designated at birth or their feminine socio- psychological identity. It is increasingly advised for people to treat travestis under the same language they would use to convey the identities women (cis and trans alike) adopt. Non-hetero travestis might identify as either femme (, or just femme), butch (/, or just butch), or neither (the translation for those two words in both Spanish and Portuguese are recent reappropriations, still potentially offensive). History and culture =Argentina= Vanessa Show, a famous vedette of the 1970s, photographed in Buenos Aires. After collecting testimonies from travestis over the age of seventy, Josefina Fern√°ndez found in 2004 that: \\"In their opinion, the first period of the Peronist government is the one that most clearly began the persecution of gays and travestis, whether or not they practiced street prostitution.\\"Fern√°ndez, 2004. p. 35 =Paraguay= In the 1980s, during Alfredo Stroessner's military dictatorship, twenty travestis were arrested as part of the Palmieri Case (Spanish: Caso Palmieri), among them the well-known Carla and Liz Paola. A 14-year-old teenager, Mario Luis Palmieri, had been found murdered and the hypothesis handled by the police was that of a homosexual crime of passion, unleashing one of the most famous persecutions of LGBT identities in the history of Paraguay. Paraguayan travestis use a secret language called jeito‚Äîoriginated in the field of prostitution‚Äîwhich they use to protect themselves from clients, the police or any person strange to the places where they work and that threatens the security of the group.Falabella, Augsten, Recalde & Oru√© Pozzo, 2017. p. 69 Some of its words are rua (street),Falabella, Augsten, Recalde & Oru√© Pozzo, 2017. p. 64 odara (the travesti head of a prostitution area),Falabella, Augsten, Recalde & Oru√© Pozzo, 2017. p. 70 alib√°n (police) and fregu√©s (clients).Falabella, Augsten, Recalde & Oru√© Pozzo, 2017. p. 71 Academic study Travestis have been studied by various disciplines, especially anthropology, which has extensively documented the phenomenon in both classical and more recent ethnographies.Fern√°ndez, 2004. p. 39 Being the country with the largest population of travestis (where they are even invoked as cultural icons),Kulick, 1998, p. 6Kulick, 1998, p. 7 Brazil is the country with the longest experience in the study of these identities, and the works written in and about Brazil outnumber those of any other Latin American country. As with other non-Western gender identities, travestis do not easily fit into a Western taxonomy that separates sex and gender. Some writers in the English language have described travestis as transgender or as a third gender. Don Kulick described the gendered world of travestis in urban Brazil as having had two categories: \\"men\\" and \\"not men\\", with women, homosexuals and travestis belonging to the latter category.Kulick, Don (1998). Travesti: Sex, Gender, and Culture among Brazilian Transgendered Prostitutes (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998) In her 1990 book, From Masculine To Feminine And All points In Between, Jennifer Anne Stevens defined travesti as \\"usually a gay male who lives full time as a woman; a gay transgenderist.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary defines travesti as \\"a passive male homosexual or transvestite.\\" Similar identity communities found in other countries include femminiello, kathoey and hijra. The use of this term, however, is also used for transfeminine people with self-identification identities other than travesti (such as literal translations of transsexual woman, transgender woman and trans woman), a politically loaded term, who are still not legally female, especially those who decide some forms of legally requested body modification, or those who for whatever reason still did not undergo such practices. This preoccupation with physical changes to genitalia is condemned by some local activists and their allies, but it is still highly prevalent, up to the pervasive use of male pronouns by the media when most travestis refer to each other using feminine pronouns. Transgender people of non-binary gender identities that are not feminine with seemingly feminine gender expression or body modifications might also be misgendered (referring to a person in a way ignorant of that person's gender identity) for the same reasons, aside disregard for the concept of a gender other than man or woman and people who feel like belonging in them (gender binarism, also known as exorsexism in some circles). Usually, the concept of gender-neutral language in Spanish and Portuguese is regarded as \\"improper language\\" by society at large, given the fact that these languages, like many others in the Indo-European language family, require a person's gender to be known for correct grammar to ensue. Living conditions Travestis are a historically vulnerable and criminalized population, victims of social exclusion and structural violence. Discrimination, harassment, arbitrary detentions, torture and murder are commonplace throughout Latin America. Sectors of LGBT activism denounce that the violence and early death to which the travesti population is subjected constitutes an authentic genocide. A study carried out in 2011 in Central America revealed, for example, that more than 80% of the surveyed population felt they have the right to attack trans and travesti people because of their way of being. In his pioneering investigation of the travesti population of Salvador, Bahia in the 1990s, anthropologist Don Kulick found that they are \\"one of the most marginalized and despised groups in Brazilian society.\\"Kulick, 1998, p. 7 According to a 2017 research published by the Ministry of Defense of Argentina, 74.6% of trans women and travestis in Buenos Aires said they had suffered some type of violence, a high number, although lower than that registered in 2005, which was 91.9%. The same study indicated that they die on average at the age of 32, well below the average life expectancy of the country. The concept of \\"travesticide\\" (Spanish: travesticidio), along with \\"transfemicide\\" or \\"trans femicide\\", has been extended to refer to the hate crime understood as the murder of a travesti due to her gender condition. According to Blas Radi and Alejandra Sard√°- Chandiramani: > Travesticide/transfemicide is the end of a continuum of violence that begins > with the expulsion of home, exclusion from education, the health system and > labor market, early initiation into prostitution/sex work, the permanent > risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, criminalization, social > stigmatization, pathologization, persecution and police violence. This > pattern of violence constitutes the space of experience for trans women and > travesties, which is mirrored in their waning horizon of expectations. In > it, death is nothing extraordinary; on the contrary, in the words of Octavio > Paz \\"life and death are inseparable, and each time the first loses > significance, the second becomes insignificant\\". Access to housing is one of the problems that most affects the travesti community. In Buenos Aires, 65.1% of travestis and trans women live in rental rooms in hotels, private houses, pensions or apartments, whether authorized by the competent body or \\"taken\\" by those who manage them irregularly. The living conditions of travestis are marked by their exclusion from the formal educational system and the labor market. In this context, prostitution is constituted as the \\"only source of income, the most widespread survival strategy and one of the very few spaces for recognition of the travesti identity as a possibility of being in the world\\". In Mexico, travesti sex workers are among the groups most affected by HIV. Activism =Argentina= Lohana Berkins, leader of the Argentine travesti rights movement, photographed in 2014. Travesti identity has an important history of political mobilization in Argentina, where it is proudly claimed as the \\"political locus par excellence\\" of resistance to the policies of gender binarism and cissexism. Argentine travestis began to get organized between the late 1980s and early 1990s, in repudiation of persecution, mistreatment and police violence, as well as the police edicts in force at that time. =Chile= On April 22, 1973, a group of young travestis gathered in the Plaza de Armas in Santiago, holding the first protest of sexual diversity in the history of Chile. A key figure in the Chilean travesti movement and cultural scene is the poet Claudia Rodr√≠guez, who began her activist career in the 1990s. =Uruguay= Uruguayan travesti activism emerged in the 1990s, during the neoliberal presidencies of Luis Alberto Lacalle and Julio Mar√≠a Sanguinetti, which \\"promoted a subordinate integration model of sexual dissidence anchored in the notion of toleration\\".

The second NYTA was the successor to the Universal Almanac. Its publisher, Andrews & McMeel, decided to discontinue that almanac, with the final edition being the 1997 issue. John W. Wright, the editor of the Universal Almanac, owned the rights to its content. He approached The New York Times Company, who agreed with his idea of creating a new almanac with the newspaper's name on it. Penguin was then brought in as the publisher, and the first edition was published in late 1997 as 1998 New York Times Almanac. Wright became the general editor of the NYTA.

Commodity plastics are plastics produced in high volumes for applications where exceptional material properties are not needed (such as packaging, food containers, and household products). In contrast to engineering plastics, commodity plastics tend to be inexpensive to produce and exhibit relatively weak mechanical properties. Some examples of commodity plastics are polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and poly(methyl methacrylate). Globally, the most widely used thermoplastic includes both Polypropylene and Polyethylene. Products made from commodity plastics include disposable plates, disposable cups, photographic and magnetic tape, clothing, reusable bags, medical trays, and seeding trays. Several investigation suggests that the kinetics of thermal degradation of commodity plastics is important to realize the complications it may bring because of the temperature that it goes through which includes production process or manufacturing process. Plastic includes high molecular weight and burning them is too risky as it is interacted with mass and energy transport which brings complications if not properly investigated. Despite the complications of plastics, plastic makers recycle for new growth as it introduces with how countries like the United States have limited the use of products made by plastics and it has also been trending in Europe and Japan. The tactics of marketing strategies to recycle plastics can be a huge growth to plastic makers as people tend to purchase the recycled materials more.

Differential Linearity where a change in the input produces a corresponding change in output and B. Differential Non-linearity, where the relationship is not directly linear Differential nonlinearity (acronym DNL) is a commonly used measure of performance in digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog- to-digital (ADC) converters. It is a term describing the deviation between two analog values corresponding to adjacent input digital values. It is an important specification for measuring error in a digital-to-analog converter (DAC); the accuracy of a DAC is mainly determined by this specification. Ideally, any two adjacent digital codes correspond to output analog voltages that are exactly one Least Significant Bit (LSB) apart. Differential non- linearity is a measure of the worst-case deviation from the ideal 1 LSB step. For example, a DAC with a 1.5 LSB output change for a 1 LSB digital code change exhibits 1‚ÅÑ2 LSB differential non-linearity. Differential non-linearity may be expressed in fractional bits or as a percentage of full scale. A differential non-linearity greater than 1 LSB may lead to a non-monotonic transfer function in a DAC.INL and DNL definitions \\"A DNL error specification of less than or equal to 1LSB guarantees a monotonic transfer function with no missing codes. \\" http://www.maxim-ic.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/283 It is also known as a missing code. Differential linearity refers to a constant relation between the change in the output and input. For transducers if a change in the input produces a uniform step change in the output the transducer possess differential linearity. Differential linearity is desirable and is inherent to a system such as a single-slope analog-to-digital converter used in nuclear instrumentation.

DRMC is the major medical referral center for northwestern Arizona, southeastern Nevada and southern Utah. DRMC is fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and is a service of Intermountain Healthcare, a nonprofit health care system serving the Intermountain West. It is also a Level II Trauma Center. History The history of hospitals in Washington County began in 1913 when, with the support of the community, Dr. Donald A. McGregor opened the Washington County Hospital. The hospital was set up in what was formerly the Morris Hotel and had seven beds. In 1917, the name of the hospital was changed to the McGregor Hospital in honor of its original physician. It was operated by the McGregor family until its closure in 1952. In 1952 the county residents provided support again for a new facility to replace the McGregor Hospital. On August 6 the new Dixie Pioneer Memorial Hospital opened for service. This hospital was also owned and operated by Washington County. By the 1970s this facility had 41 beds. The former Dixie Pioneer Memorial Hospital, which was built on the west half of the current 400 East campus, was eventually torn down to make way for later expansion of medical facilities. After twenty more years of growth within the region, the county residents once again approved funding for additional medical facilities. In May 1972 a bond was approved for the new Dixie Medical Center, with actual construction beginning in 1975. The new facility had 65 beds and was built on the campus of the former Dixie Pioneer Memorial Hospital. It officially opened on January 1, 1976. In 1975, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints divested itself of its hospitals and turned over ownership and operation to a newly formed nonprofit organization. This new organization, Intermountain Healthcare (but then known as Intermountain Health Care [IHC]) assumed the operations of fifteen hospitals. However, the nearest of these hospitals was the Garfield Memorial Hospital, over away in Panguitch, Utah (the rest were in Northern Utah, Southeastern Idaho, and Southwestern Wyoming). In the months that followed the opening of the new Dixie Medical Center, Washington County arranged for the sale of its new hospital to IHC for $2.65 million (). The deal, which was finalized in August 1976, was the first hospital facility to be purchased by IHC. Less than a decade later further expansion of the facility was necessary, so another $12.2 million () was completed on the medical center in 1983. In 2003 IHC changed the name to the current Dixie Regional Medical Center. Two years later, IHC changed its own name to Intermountain Healthcare (or just Intermountain, for short). Rapid population growth in the region necessitated additional facilities, but since there was little additional room on the current campus an entirely new facility was built on a site about ten blocks east (on the east side of I-15). Construction began in 2001 on the new facility at a cost of $100 million (). It opened for service on November 24, 2003, but did not entirely replace the old facility. Jointly the two facilities had a 245-bed capacity. Life Flight (Intermountain's air ambulance service) began operating from the new facility on January 14, 2014. When controversy arose over the name \\"Dixie\\" in 2020, Intermountain Health Care announced the name would change to Intermountain St. George Regional Hospital on January 1, 2021. DRMC River Road Campus  The Dixie Regional Medical Center main campus is located at 1380 East Medical Center Drive and is often referred to as the River Road Campus of the DRMC (as it is located just east of River Road). The state-of-the-art + facility hosts 132 acute inpatient beds and the community's emergency department. Healthcare in southern Utah advanced to a new level as the first tertiary service, open- heart surgery, was performed on 2 December 2003. The hospital has since been named a Top 50 Cardiovascular Hospital by Truven Health Analytics. DRMC 400 East Campus The former main DRMC facility, which is located at 544 South 400 East, is still used for additional services and is often referred to as the 400 East Campus of the DRMC. Southern Utah's first Acute Rehabilitation Center, which providing specialty care for stroke and other neurologically impaired patients, opened on the newly remodeled 5th Floor, December 26, 2003. The Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) opened in May 2005. Women's and children's care, the smallest fully accredited cancer center in the nation, same-day surgery, wound clinic, lab, some imaging services, IV therapy, the diabetes clinic, hyperbaric medicine clinic and behavioral medicine are also located at this campus.

It was the first of Chapman's plays to be produced on the stage; its success inaugurated his career as a dramatist. Performance and publication The play was acted by the Admiral's Men at the Rose Theatre; the records of theatre impresario Philip Henslowe show that it premiered on 12 February 1596. A popular hit, Blind Beggar was staged 22 times throughout April 1597. (Performances of Blind Beggar on 15 April, 26 April and 13 May 1596 paid 40 shillings per day, a better and more consistent return than provided by most of the company's offerings that season.)John Payne Collier, ed., The Diary of Philip Henslowe, from 1591 to 1609, London, The Shakespeare Society, 1845; pp. 67‚Äì8. The play was revived in 1601 and 1602. The work was published after its initial run: it was entered into the Stationers' Register on 15 August 1598 and appeared in print later that year, in a quarto issued by the bookseller William Jones. (The play was less popular in print than on stage: the quarto was never reprinted. This set a pattern for Chapman's remaining dramatic career; with the exception of his masterpiece Bussy D'Ambois, Chapman's plays rarely went through more than a single edition.)E. K. Chambers. The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 251‚Äì9. The printed text, unfortunately, is mangled, incomplete, and unusually short; it likely represents a version cut down for an abbreviated stage presentation, which emphasizes the farcical comedy at the expense of the romantic main plot.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The New Intellectuals: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1977; p. 148. Plot Chapman's comedy derives from the commedia dell'arte tradition of Italy ‚Äî perhaps more directly than most English plays so influenced: Chapman may have based Blind Beggar on a commedia that he witnessed first-hand during a trip to Italy.Helen Andrews Kaufman, \\"The Blind Beggar of Alexandria: A Reappraisal,\\" Philological Quarterly 38 (1959), pp. 10‚Äì16. Not atypically for a play so influenced, the plot of Blind Beggar depends heavily on the comedic effects of disguise. Cleanthes, a swindler and pretended duke, has wooed the imperious Queen Aegiale, who rewards his temerity by banishing him. Cleanthes returns to Alexandria in the guise of the blind beggar and fortune-teller Irus. In that disguise and others ‚Äî Leon the usurer, and the \\"mad-brain\\" aristocrat Count Hermes ‚Äî Cleanthes manipulates people and events to turn in his favor (and for the sheer egotistical fun of it). He seduces Aegiale; he marries a pair of sisters in his different personas ‚Äî and then tempts both of them to engage in adultery, though only with himself in other guises. He ends up king of Egypt, and disposes of his two sibling wives (now pregnant) as the mates of two captured kings. Critics have recognized Cleanthes, a shepherd by birth who becomes a king, as a comic parody of Christopher Marlowe's Tamburlaine.Eugene M. Waith, Ideas of Greatness: Heroic Drama in England, London, Routledge, 1971; pp. 124‚Äì5. Even in a relatively light and slight project like Blind Beggar, a hint of Chapman's classical learning and inclination shows through. The pretend-beggar Irus is named after the bragging beggar who foolishly challenges Odysseus to a fight in the final book of The Odyssey. Some of the farcical comedy elements in Blind Beggar may be the work of an unknown play doctor rather than Chapman himself; the dedication printed in the first edition of his later comedy All Fools (published 1605) indicates that Chapman supervised the publication of that text himself, to prevent the appearance of a play \\"patch'd with others' wit.\\" This may imply that earlier Chapman comedies, Blind Beggar and perhaps An Humorous Day's Mirth, had been \\"patch'd\\" in just this way. Influence The Blind Beggar of Alexandria was hardly the first disguise play to appear on the Elizabethan stage; the anonymous The Knack to Know an Honest Man (1594), another Admiral's play, is one prior instance, and others can be noted.Roslyn L. Knutson, \\"Toe to Toe across Maid Lane: Repertorial Competition at the Rose and Globe, 1599‚Äì1600,\\" in: Acts of Criticism: Performance Matters in Shakespeare and His Contemporaries, Paul Nelsen and June Schlueter, eds. Madison/Teaneck, NJ, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2006; pp. 21‚Äì37, esp. pp. 30 and 37. Yet the popularity of Chapman's play gave an impetus to the comic device; disguise plays were produced frequently in its aftermath. The anonymous Look About You (printed 1600), The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (1600) by Henry Chettle and John Day, Westward Ho and Northward Ho (c. 1604-5) by Thomas Dekker and John Webster, and Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour (1598), Volpone (1606) and The Alchemist (1610) are among the various examples that can be cited.William J.

Non-stick cookware is a common application, where the non-stick coating allows food to brown without sticking to the pan. Non-stick is often used to refer to surfaces coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a well-known brand of which is Teflon. In the twenty-first century, other coatings have been marketed as non-stick, such as anodized aluminium, ceramics, silicone, enameled cast iron, and seasoned cookware. Types =Ancient Greece= The Mycenaean Greeks might have used non-stick pans to make bread more than 3,000 years ago. Mycenaean ceramic griddles had one smooth side and one side covered with tiny holes. The bread was probably placed on the side with the holes, since the dough tended to stick when cooked on the smooth side of the pan. The holes seem to be an ancient non-sticking technology, ensuring that oil spread evenly over the griddle.Ancient Greeks Used Portable Grills at Their Picnics, LiveScienceHow to Cook Like a Mycenaean, Archaeology Magazine =Seasoning= Cast iron skillets, before seasoning (left) and after several years of use (right) Commercial waffle iron requiring seasoning Cast iron, carbon steel,How to Season a Wok- Serious Eats cast aluminium and stainless steel cookwarehttps://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/how-to-turn-stainless-steel- skillet-nonstick-article may be seasoned before cooking by applying a fat to the surface and heating it to polymerize it. This produces a dry, hard, smooth, hydrophobic coating, which is non-stick when food is cooked in conjunction with a small amount of cooking oil or fat. =Fluoropolymer= The modern non-stick pans were made using a coating of Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE). PTFE was invented serendipitously by Roy Plunkett in 1938, while working for a joint venture of the DuPont company. The substance was found to have several unique properties, including very good corrosion-resistance and the lowest coefficient of friction of any substance yet manufactured. PTFE was first used to make seals resistant to the uranium hexafluoride gas used in development of the atomic bomb during World War II, and was regarded as a military secret. Dupont registered the Teflon trademark in 1944 and soon began planning for post-war commercial use of the new product. By 1951 Dupont had developed applications for Teflon in commercial bread and cookie-making; however, the company avoided the market for consumer cookware due to potential problems associated with release of toxic gases if stove-top pans were overheated in inadequately ventilated spaces. While working at DuPont, NYU Tandon School of Engineering alumnus John Gilbert was asked to evaluate a newly- developed material called Teflon. His experiments using the fluorinated polymer as a surface coating for pots and pans helped usher in a revolution in non-stick cookware. A few years later, a French engineer had begun coating his fishing gear with Teflon to prevent tangles. His wife Colette suggested using the same method to coat her cooking pans. The idea was successful and a French patent was granted for the process in 1954. The Tefal company was formed in 1956 to manufacture non-stick pans. Not all non-stick pans use Teflon; other non-stick coatings have become available. For example, a mixture of titanium and ceramic can be sandblasted onto the pan surface, and then fired at to produce a non-stick ceramic coating. PTFE (Teflon) Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic fluoropolymer used in various applications including non-stick coatings. Teflon is a brand of PTFE, often used as a generic term for PTFE. The metallic substrate is roughened by abrasive blasting, then sometimes electric-arc sprayed with stainless steel.Nicholas J. Wall, , 1988Laurence W. McKeen, Fluorinated coatings and finishes handbook, 2006, p. 117 The irregular surface promotes adhesion of the PTFE and also resists abrasion of the PTFE.Excalibur brochure, PDF Then one to seven layers of PTFE are sprayed or rolled on, with a larger number of layers and spraying being better. The number and thickness of the layers and quality of the material determine the quality of the non-stick coating. Better-quality coatings are more durable, and less likely to peel and flake, and keep their non-stick properties for longer. Any PTFE-based coating will rapidly lose its non-stick properties if overheated; all manufacturers recommend that temperatures be kept below, typically, . Utensils used with PTFE-coated pans can scratch the coating, if the utensils are harder than the coating; this can be prevented by using non-metallic (usually plastic or wood) cooking tools.  Health concerns  When pans are overheated beyond approximately 350 ¬∞C (660 ¬∞F) the PTFE coating begins to dissociate, releasing hydrofluoric acid and a variety of organofluorine compounds which can cause polymer fume fever in humans and can be lethal to birds. Concerns have been raised over the possible negative effects of using PTFE-coated cooking pans.American Cancer Society, Teflon and Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Processing of PTFE in the past used to include PFOA as an emulsifier; however, PFOA is a persistent organic pollutant and poses both environmental and health concerns, and is now being phased out of use in PTFE processing.Juliet Eilperin: Harmful Teflon Chemical To Be Eliminated by 2015. The Washington Post, 2006-01-26 PFOA is now replaced by the GenX product manufactured by the DuPont spin-off Chemours, which seems to pose similar health issues as the now banned PFOA.  Culinary uses and limitations  With other types of pans, some oil or fat is required to prevent hot food from sticking to the pan's surface. Food does not have the same tendency to stick to a non-stick surface; pans can be used with less, or no oil, and are easier to clean as residues do not stick to the surface. According to writer Tony Polombo, pans that are not non-stick are better for producing pan gravy, because the fond (the caramelized drippings that stick to the pan when meat is cooked) sticks to them, and can be turned into pan gravy by deglazing them--dissolving them in liquid. =Superhydrophobic= A superhydrophobic coating is a thin surface layer that repels water. It is made from superhydrophobic (ultrahydrophobicity) materials. Droplets hitting this kind of coating can fully rebound.Richard, Denis, Christophe Clanet, and David Qu√©r√©. \\"Surface phenomena: Contact time of a bouncing drop.\\" Nature 417.6891 (2002): 811-811Yahua Liu, Lisa Moevius, Xinpeng Xu,Tiezheng Qian, Julia M Yeomans, Zuankai Wang. \\"Pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic surfaces.\\" Nature Physics, 10, 515-519 (2014) Generally speaking, superhydrophobic coatings are made from composite materials where one component provides the roughness and the other provides low surface energy. This image shows highly absorbent filter paper coated with a super-hydrophobic paint developed at University College London. This repels water (which has been dyed orange for greater contrast) =Liquid- impregnated surface= A liquid-impregnated surface consists of two distinct layers. The first is a highly textured or porous substrate with features spaced sufficiently close to stably contain the second layer which is an impregnating liquid that fills in the spaces between the features. The liquid must have a surface energy well-matched to the substrate in order to form a stable film. These surfaces bioimitate the carnivorous Venezuelan Pitcher Plant, which uses microscale hairs to create a water slide that causes ants to slip to their death. Slippery surfaces are finding applications in commercial products, anti-fouling surfaces, anti-icing and biofilm-resistant medical devices.

It is a Level II Trauma Center.  History  Originally founded in 1939 as Utah Valley Hospital, UVH was equipped with 55 bed and 38 physicians. By 1953 through request of the board of directors, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints assumed ownership of Utah Valley Hospital. Utah Valley Hospital became the first fully staffed 24-hour emergency center south of Salt Lake City by 1970 and by 1984 had a name change. The name of the hospital was officially changed to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center. The name change reflected growth of the facility and services, making it one of Utah's largest major referral centers, serving all of central and southern Utah and its surrounding areas. In 2014 the hospital celebrated its 75th anniversary, and a major hospital replacement project is announced to eventually replace the East Tower and provide the latest technology and medical services to the community which would be set to start in 2015. The construction and replacement project included a 12-story patient tower on the southwest corner of campus, and a nine-story medical office building on the east side of campus. By 2016, the name of the hospital was officially changed back to Utah Valley Hospital. As Utah Valley Hospital grew, it continued its evolution as a place of learning, a place of caring, and a place of healing. It also opened the Utah Valley Hospital Primary Children's Network which offered the best pediatric care for patients and their families, close to home. Offered programs include the Utah Valley Heart Center, the Newborn ICU and Cancer Services. Other services include Emergency and Trauma Services, Critical Care, Women's and Children's Services, Behavioral Health and the Utah Valley Rehabilitation Center. The UVRMC Cancer Center treats more than 20 forms of cancer. Life Flight has one of its air ambulance helicopters stationed at UVRMC.

The bearers are predominantly Bosniaks of Montenegro and Muslims by nationality originating from Bihor, a region in northern Montenegro (Sand≈æak), which encompasses parts of the municipalities of Berane and Bijelo Polje. Earlier, the letter R was preceded by the letter H, which was lost over time. One of the legends says that the surname was obtained from an oak tree, of which there are many in the area where this surname originated. One of the oral traditions and legends also says that the Rastoderi originated from the village of Dupilo in Crmnica, municipality of Bar, and that earlier, before accepting Islam, their last name was Petroviƒái.Residents with the surname Rastoder are from the village of Petnjica, Radmanci,Savin Bor municipality of Berane in Montenegro. Sand≈æak region was originally the smallest administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire, later part of the province - vilayet. The Turkish ( Sancaƒüƒ± ), word sandzak means \\"flag\\". Is geographical area administratively divided between Serbia and Montenegro . History According to a legend, the ancestors of the Rastoder family were from Kuƒçi. These ancestors emigrated from Kuƒçi either in the 17th or 18th century. One part of the family went to Dupilo in Crmnica, and the other to the mountains of Plav, of which the Medunjani descend from. The family in Dupilo, because of a blood revenge (krvna osveta, or gjakmarrje), emigrated north, but a part of the family (known as the Petroviƒá at that time) decided to stay. The descendants of these Petroviƒás claim that the Metropolitan of Cetinje told them that they couldn't be known as Petroviƒá any longer, so they instead adopted the name Hrstoderi (later Hrastoderi) because they avenged and hung a man on an oak tree (hrast), hence their surname. Another saying, not too different from the previous one, says that the ancestors of the Rastoders emigrated to Radmanci and converted to Islam. They didn't have enough food when they arrived in Radmanci, so they peeled off the bark of oak trees (hrastovi) in order to enlarge the amount of flour for bread. It is not excluded that by that only oak valley came the surname Hrastoder. A third story, more of a legend, says that before the coming of the Turks, there lived some Rasodijeri, however, it is not certain whether if they were Bogomils or others, maybe even Pagans, but later converted to Islam. They were recorded in books in mosques as Hrastoderi rather than Rasodijeri. The surname without the H (Rastoder) was realised during and after the period of the Kingdom of Montenegro, in the registers, instead of being located in mosques, were located in local town and the Hrastoderi were recorded as Rastoderi as the registrars were Montenegrins and even today, the phoneme H isn't pronounced by Montenegrins and wasn't either at that time. Some descendants of Rastoder families of Bihor have changed their surnames, such as the Kr≈°iƒá and Nurkoviƒá in Ro≈æaje, as well as Medunjanin.

They are found in the resin glands of the flowers of the hop plant and are the source of hop bitterness. Alpha acids may be isomerized to form iso-alpha acids by the application of heat in solution. Iso-alpha acids (iso-Œ±-acids) are typically produced in beer from the addition of hops to the boiling wort. The degree of isomerization and the amount of bitter flavor produced by the addition of hops is highly dependent on the length of time the hops are boiled. Longer boil times will result in isomerization of more alpha acids and thus increased bitterness. Common alpha acids include humulone, adhumulone, cohumulone, posthumulone, and prehumulone. The most common iso-Œ±-acids are cis- and trans-isohumulone. Bittering The alpha acid \\"rating\\" on hops indicates the amount of alpha acid as a percentage of total weight of the hop. Hops with a higher alpha acid content will contribute more bitterness than a lower alpha acid hop when using the same amount of hops. High alpha acid varieties of hops are more efficient for producing highly bitter beers. Alpha acid percentages vary within specific varieties depending on growing conditions, drying methods, age of the hop, and other factors. For example, this list shows the typical range of alpha acids found in some common varieties (percentages are based on total dried weight). * Cascade 4.5-8% * Centennial 9-11.5% * Chinook 12-14% * East Kent Goldings 4.5-7% * Hallertauer Hersbrucker 2.5-5% * Mt. Hood 3.5-8% * Saaz 2-5% * Styrian Goldings 4.5-7% * Willamette 4-7% Anti-bacterial properties Iso-Œ±- acids have a bacteriostatic effect on many common Gram-positive bacteria found in beer. While the iso-Œ±-acids are very effective at preventing serious contamination from Gram-positive bacteria such as the lactic acid bacteria, there are some strains that are quite resistant to the effects of the iso-Œ±- acids. The iso-Œ±-acids have no effect on Gram-negative bacteria, and therefore the brewer must rely on maintaining proper sanitiation and anaerobic conditions of the finished beer to ensure shelf stability.

She is author of the foilist's classic textbook Foil Fencing, now in its 8th edition. In the second edition (1972), former F.I.E. President Miguel de Capriles identified her as \\"a sensational teen-age Pacific Coast champion before the war [who subsequently] returned to competition to win a well-earned No. 3 national rating. She is one of the small but bright cluster of California women who dominated the national fencing scene in those years\\". She holds the distinction of having been accredited the first woman fencing master in the United States, by her fencing master, the Hungarian Istvan Danosi (b. 1912, d. 2005), USFA Hall of Fame recipient. Her first fencing master was Henry Uyttenhove, who was Douglas Fairbank Sr.'s fencing trainer. Uyttenhove was fencing master at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, to which Fairbanks belonged. Uyttenhove was replaced by Jon Hermann, also from Belgium. Muriel was obviously Hermann's star pupil, but a serious car accident prevented her going to the 1948 Olympics (she had made the team), and she started working with Hermann as his assistant. She was going to college during this period, earning a bachelors in PE at UCLA and a Masters at USC. In the 1970s Muriel coached the California State University Northridge and has subsequently been inducted into that University's Hall of Fame.

In 1942, the U.S. Navy selected Merle Fogg Airport in Fort Lauderdale to expand into a naval air station for both pilot and enlisted aircrew training (i.e., gunners, radiomen) in Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers flown by carrier-based US Navy flight crews and by land-based US Marine Corps flight crews ashore.Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Historical Association website discussing history of the facility: During 1942 the Merle Fogg Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida was selected by the United States Navy to be improved into a naval aviation facility. Additional facilities were used to train aircraft maintenance and other ground crew support for the TBF and TBM series aircraft. Among the Avenger pilots who graduated NAS Fort Lauderdale was former President George H. W. Bush, from a class in 1943.Florida military bases, from FSU Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale was one of the bases where former President George Bush received his training. Several airfields in the immediate vicinity of NAS Fort Lauderdale were commissioned as Navy satellite airfields, also known as outlying fields (OLF). Several of these fields continue in operation today as civilian airports, such as Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport and North Perry Airport. TBF /TBM training was difficult and dangerous. From 1942 through 1946, 94 trainees lost their lives while serving at NAS Fort Lauderdale. Fourteen of those men made up a five-aircraft flight, now known as Flight 19, that disappeared while on a routine training mission on December 5, 1945.

It is located in Ogden, Utah, United States. With 310 licensed beds, it is the 3rd largest hospital in the Intermountain system, and the 4th largest Hospital in Utah. Although not directly affiliated with the university, it is located just southwest of the main campus of Weber State University. McKay-Dee Hospital offers nationally ranked programs including the Heart and Vascular Institute and Newborn ICU. Other programs include the Huntsman-Intermountain Cancer Center, McKay-Dee Spine Institute, Emergency and Trauma Services and the new Stewart Rehab Center. McKay-Dee Hospital serves northern Utah and portions of southeast Idaho and western Wyoming.

Dee Memorial Hospital at 24th Street and Harrison Boulevard in Ogden opened on December 29, 1910, and closed on July 12, 1969, with its patients transferring to the new David O. McKay Hospital at 3939 Harrison Boulevard. The Dee, as it was called for 59 years, began a second life on November 10, 1971, when the new facility bearing the same name opened its doors adjacent to the McKay, as an integral part of the McKay-Dee Hospital Center. From the very beginning, the story of the Dee Hospital has been interwoven with the life stories of the Dee family. The Thomas D. Dee Memorial Hospital was founded in 1910 by Annie Taylor Dee and her children as a memorial to their husband and father. = Formative years = The Thomas D. Dee Memorial Hospital Association was incorporated February 3, 1910. Hospitals in the United States and Europe were studied and plans were prepared by Ogden architect L. S. Hodgson. The contract to build the hospital was awarded to C. J. Humphris of Ogden for $46,625. The building's cornerstone was laid in the northwest corner of the building on September 27, 1910 at 12 noon, with community leaders and members of the Dee family attending. The hospital was ready for occupancy on December 29, 1910, and was formally presented to the public in a ceremony on the fourth floor. Fifteen patients were transferred from Ogden General Hospital two days later. Rates at the hospital were $3 a day for a private room, $2 for a ward, and $25 for 14 days as a maternity patient. The operating room charge was $10. Nurses' work day was 12 hours with 1/2-day off per week when the patient load permitted. The first year's statistics show a total of 895 patients, 481 operations and 5 births. In 1912, the first doctor began his internship at the hospital, and in 1913 the Dee Hospital School of Nursing graduated its first class. Students were housed in the basement of the hospital and classes were held in the evening after the students had worked full 12-hour shifts. Later, living quarters were moved to several houses near the hospital, and this arrangement continued until August 1917, when a Nurses' Home was completed. Ogden's first x-ray machine was received as a gift in 1913. Its usefulness was limited to detecting prominent bone fractures and large metallic foreign objects in the body. A hip joint picture required a 10-minute exposure. Dr. Ezra Rich did the first blood transfusion in Ogden at the Dee on February 9, 1913. It was a direct gravity flow between two brothers, one of whom had been injured in a saw mill accident near Malad, Idaho. Typing and cross-matching of blood was unknown at the time, but the injured patient recovered. By 1914, it became evident that the Dee family could no longer be expected to maintain the hospital which had accrued a substantial operating deficit since it opened. Appeals for help in keeping the Hospital open were made, but were unfruitful until an appeal was made to a family friend, David O. McKay. McKay arranged an interview with Joseph F. Smith, Anthon H. Lund, Charles W. Penrose, and Charles W. Nibley, who intervened by the LDS Church essentially taking over the finances of the hospital. =Growth= The Hospital then entered on a period of growth. * 1917 Nursing home and school completed. New x-ray machine purchased. * 1919 Nitrous oxide gas anesthesia first used. * 1919 South wing addition constructed and fully equipped laboratory established. * 1921 Radiology department organized. * 1922 Radium, the first in northern Utah, used in Hospital. * 1925 First full-time radiologist/pathologist joined the staff. * 1927 North wing constructed. * 1928 Physiotherapy added to Hospital services. * 1929 Pharmacy established, staffed by full-time pharmacist. * 1932 First oxygen tent used in Utah and Capitol Street parking lot given by Drs. Ezra and Clark Rich. * 1937 Central Service established, enabling centralized preparation of equipment and supplies. Now used universally by all hospitals, the Dee's Central Service department was the first in Utah. * 1938 Pediatrics division opened to provide special nursing care for children. * 1942 Separate pathology and radiology departments formed. * 1944 First penicillin administered. * 1946 Ogden Surgical Society formed in Nurses' Home auditorium and Blood Bank established to meet increasing demands for whole blood. * 1948 First outpatient clinics started. By 1949, the Dee Hospital was again struggling for economic survival. =Management changes= LDS Church Presiding Bishop, LeGrand Richards, chairman of the hospital's Board of Trustees, decided a change in management philosophy was indicated. He recruited Kenneth E. Knapp, a United Airlines executive, and enrolled him in hospital administration classes at Northwestern University. After serving preceptorships in hospitals in Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland, Mr. Knapp became administrator of the Dee Hospital in April, 1951. He found the Dee in precarious financial condition and took firm steps to alleviate the situation, consolidating departments and closing patient units whose census had fallen below an efficient operating level. At the same time, he invited other community services to lease space in the building and this income bolstered the hospital's financial position. Consolidating departments enabled a reduction in employees. =Renovation and new services= By August, just four months after he became administrator, Mr. Knapp began planning a floor- by- floor renovation of the hospital. Ever-tightening building and fire codes forced other, more extensive remodeling. For this, the Hospital borrowed money from the LDS Church. Under Mr. Knapp's administration, ten years of remarkable change and progress followed, including: * Psychiatry division established, the first in a Utah general hospital. * Physical Therapy department started under supervision of a registered therapist. * Personnel department established. * Inservice department for continuing education begun. * Childbirth education classes started. *Emergency Room opened. * Outpatient department organized. * A polio ward equipped with an iron lung By April 1952, the Board of Trustees approved a 10-year, $523,000 modernization program. It was to include a new neuropsychiatric division, an expanded radiology department with new equipment, a new nursery, and additional bathrooms in the maternity division. New pediatric and orthopedic areas were planned, along with an improved central service system, two new surgical suites and a post- operative recovery room. Other new patient services would include an enlarged blood bank, piped oxygen, and an intercom system between patient rooms and nursing stations. Also planned were new administrative offices, new medical staff lounge and library. The elevators would be modernized and the entire hospital redecorated with new lounges and waiting areas. The hospital also set the standards necessary to apply for accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals ‚Äì the first Utah hospital to do so. In June 1953, an effort to persuade women with young families to work in the hospital, a day nursery was opened in the Dee Nursing School building, where mothers could leave their children while they worked at the hospital, a fore-runner of the present D Play School. Technological developments coupled with population growth necessitated eleven major additions to the Hospital during the 1950s. These included wings on the north, south, east and west, two mechanical boiler units, an addition to the nurses' home, a laundry and kitchen, a fifth floor for the radiology department, clinical laboratory and nuclear medicine. An anesthesia department was added in 1953 with the physicians-anesthesiologists working for the hospital; a Volunteer Auxiliary was formed in 1954; radium therapy on a regular basis was begun in 1955; surgery, the delivery room and the top floor of the hospital were air-conditioned and living quarters for residents and their families were completed in the former Nurses' Home. In 1955, the Dee School of Nursing and Weber College participated in a national study program under Columbia University Teachers' College with six other community colleges and their hospital affiliates. The study underscored nursing's need for more medical and scientific knowledge. The Dee School of Nursing was phased out. Weber College took over the classes and the hospital became the setting for clinical experience. The new program introduced the two-year associate degree concept to the field of nursing education. In its 45 years of existence, the Dee School of Nursing had graduated more than 700 nurses. =New Hospital= As technical knowledge increased and the mechanics of delivering health care became more complex each year, the Board of Trustees began to contemplate if a new hospital was needed. A thorough examination of building was undertaken, with particular attention paid to changing fire and building codes. Also a nationally recognized consultant was asked to review the community's health care needs and make a recommendation. As a result, a recommendation was made to build a new hospital. A tract of land was acquired, and in February 1958 an announcement was made that a new $5-million hospital would be built. $1.5-million of the cost was to be raised by the local community, with the rest of the expense to be borne by the LDS Church. Lack of community interest was evident and by August 11, 1958 planning for the new Hospital had been suspended. It wasn't until April, 1962, that a new Presiding Bishop, John H. Vandenberg, announced Keith Wilcox and Associates had been selected to begin architectural work on a new hospital, now estimated to cost $8-million. The community would be asked to raise $1.6 million. In 1963, the Hospital Development committee suggested that the proposed new hospital be named in honor of LDS Church President David O. McKay, as it was President McKay who brought the Thomas D. Dee Memorial Hospital into the Church Hospital System. In August 1965 final plans for the 380-bed hospital were ready, with require 730 calendar days to be completed. However biding for the construction project would not be opened until January 26, 1966. On April 20, 1966, the First Presidency authorized construction of the hospital at a cost of $9,971,785, including furnishings. Okland Construction Company of Salt Lake City was low bidder at $8,198,000. A formal ground-breaking ceremony was held on Friday, April 23, 1966, when President McKay threw the switch to detonate dynamite that signaled start of construction. The fund drive for the new Hospital continued, with famed comedian Jack Benny was brought to Valley Music Hall in Bountiful. Hospital architect Keith Wilcox and builder Jack Okland also announced plans to construct a professional building adjacent to the McKay. The new Hospital, plagued by construction problems since the groundbreaking, encountered yet another setback in February when the vinyl flooring did not meet specifications. Its opening was postponed until mid-May. In actuality, it was July 9, 1969, before the hospital was ready. One-hundred- fifty-four patients were transferred to the McKay from the Dee on July 12, 1969, in two hours and 40 minutes. The only unit remaining open in the Dee Hospital was the Tuberculosis ward, until those patients were moved to the Weber County Hospital on June 30. =Continued progress= In the meantime, the Dee continued to progress. In 1959, one of the first intensive care units in the region was opened. Remodeling of the Dee continued because of growing patient loads, and the former Nurses' Home was converted to experimental units to test the first Multi-Level Care concept, where patients were placed according to the amount of care their illness demanded. The Dee family's continued support of the hospital was evidenced again in the spring of 1963 when a new Home Care program was begun, with the Annie T. Dee Foundation underwriting its operation. It was the first hospital-based home health care program in the State and was not duplicated until the late 1970s, when the federal government sponsored a similar program in the rural area around Richfield. Patient care continued to advance, as a unique \\"blood assurance\\" program was begun to ensure a continuing supply of donated blood to the Hospital Blood Bank. A new Social Services department was begun and purchase of equipment costing in excess of $36,000 was authorized for the Cardiopulmonary Laboratory. Once construction was underway, the original Hospital began to prepare for the advent of Medicare. The Administrator reported a significant drop in admission of patients over age 65, as they waited for the Medicare Act to become official to help them pay for the cost of their medical care. In July, an agreement was finalized with the State of Utah to take over the care of the tubercular patients housed in the State Sanitarium. In August, 1966, 24-hour physician coverage of the Emergency Room began. An investigation was begun into the future of the original Dee Hospital. By June, 1968, it was decided the Dee could best serve the community by converting its assets into a new hospital plant adjacent to the McKay. This would fulfill the LDS Church commitment to the Dee family, made in 1916, that \\"there will always be a Dee Hospital in Ogden.\\" Alternative plans for use of the building were suggested and architectural planning for the new Dee began. =1970s= A new operating structure for the LDS Church Hospitals came about in July 1970, with the formation of Health Services Corporation. Contributions began to flow into the very successful Foundation. A special procedures operating room was endowed, along with a new dining room, a helistop on the hospital grounds close to the Emergency Room entrance and a mural for the lobby of the McKay. Six young doctors began three-year family practice residencies on July 1, which ended the well-established internship program begun at the Dee in 1912. The first open heart surgery performed in the Ogden area was done at the McKay in November 1970. Establishment of the unit and training of 40 perfusionists to operate the heart-lung by-pass pump were approved by the Governing Board after a comprehensive study by a medical staff and administration committee demonstrated a community need for the service. With three qualified thoracic surgeons on the staff, it was no longer necessary for patients to go to Salt Lake City for this life-saving surgery. The new Dee Hospital was opened in special ceremonies on the afternoon of November 10, 1971‚Äîthe 127th anniversary of the birth of Thomas D. Dee, in whose memory the original Dee Hospital was founded in 1910. With the opening of the new Dee, a new principle of patient care was introduced to the community. Called \\"Multi-Level Care,\\" it was designed to admit the patient to the exact level of care required by the intensity of his illness and to provide him with the exact amount of professional and technological support he needs to overcome that illness. The first major remodeling project in the McKay early in 1973 on the second floor. It included addition of two more private labor rooms for a total of ten, and all labor rooms were enlarged to accommodate fetal heart monitoring equipment. The capacity of the Intensive Care Nursery was increased to eight isolettes, and a high risk delivery room was created adjacent to the ICN. A recovery area for mothers following delivery was added in the post-partum wing, and a fathers' waiting room was built. Total cost of the remodeling was $250,000. The LDS Church made headlines in September, 1974, with the announcement that it was giving its $60-million chain of 15 hospitals to the communities they served. A new non- Church, not-for-profit corporation was formed to operate the hospitals. The new entity acquired a name, Intermountain Health Care, and a president and chief executive Officer, Scott S. Parker, early in 1975. The new Board of Trustees included Thomas D. Dee, II, as treasurer. It was mid-1976 before the lengthy legal divestiture proceedings were completed and the corporate offices were moved from the Church office building. The hospital also opened a Gastroenterology Laboratory, purchased an Ultrasound system, installed a Gamma camera in Nuclear Medicine, added a telemetry monitoring system to the Coronary Care Unit, purchased four more fetal heart rate monitors and eight more vital sign monitors for ICU and the post-operative Recovery Room. The Porter Family Practice Model Unit outgrew its quarters in the Professional building and was relocated in the Rocky Mountain Plaza at 3950 Harrison Blvd. Three large construction projects were begun in 1975: remodeling of the Emergency Room; construction of the Edith Dee Mack Green Auditorium and multipurpose classroom center; and installation of a waste compactor. In 1976, the Hospital recorded growth in three major areas ‚Äì Rehabilitation Medicine, Psychiatric services and births. The fourth floor of the Dee Hospital was dedicated to Rehabilitation nursing. A fifth physician joined the group of doctors to provide 24-hour care in the Emergency Room, and remodeling of the area was completed, at a cost of $140,000. A major structural change was made in 1977 when a connecting corridor was built between the second floors of the McKay and Dee. Its completion gave better access to the mother and infant overflow unit on 2 Dee. A long-awaited total body scanner was installed in September 1977, providing physicians with a sophisticated new diagnostic service. The Hospital acquired ownership of the McKay Professional building in 1978; and renamed it in honor of Lawrence T. Dee. The conversion of wards into private rooms continued; the net result to be 87 new private rooms for patient comfort and security. The Thomas G. Barker Vascular Laboratory to detect the possibility of stroke was opened. In January 1979, the orthopedic unit moved into its new home on the sixth floor of the McKay. Subsequently, patients from the third floor of the Dee were relocated on the fourth floor of the McKay and Rehab patients were moved down one floor to 3 Dee. These moves freed the fourth floor of the Dee so that construction could begin on a centralized diagnostic and treatment center for cardiopulmonary illnesses. In March, 1979, patients and staff participated in breaking ground for the Annex to house Rehabilitation Medicine and storage. Part of the same contract was a new elevator system to connect the two hospital buildings on the \\"A\\" level, 3, 4 and 5 floors, as well as an extension of the clinical laboratory and new air exchange system for the operating rooms. July 12, 1979 marked the tenth anniversary of the new David O. McKay Hospital. In that decade, 36,384 babies were born and 177,552 patients were admitted. 1979 also saw the opening of the hospital's first outreach facility. =1980s= In chronological order, major events in 1980 were completion of a remodeling project on Pediatrics to open an intermediate care unit, the dedication of the new Rehabilitation Center, and a change in Hospital administration. 1980 marked the opening of a new rehabilitation center at McKay-Dee. The center included a rehabilitation therapy pool as well as a gym for cardiac rehabilitation patients. Completion of the Rehabilitation Center freed space on the \\"A\\" level of the Dee for construction of an integrated Outpatient Surgery Center. Patients enter the Center through the south door of the Dee Hospital, are registered on \\"A\\", and any tests ordered by the physicians are completed in the same area prior to surgery. After a period in the Recovery Room, the patient is returned to one of the 14 adult or 6 pediatric beds in the Surgical Center for an observation and recovery period before returning home the same day, usually within a total span of four to six hours for the entire procedure. In 1986, the doors opened on the new McKay-Dee outpatient surgical center and professional office building. In June 1987, the McKay-Dee Institute for Behavioral Health began operations. The facility was designed for privacy and convenience with separate treatment areas for children and adults. It provides inpatient and outpatient treatment for a variety of disorders including depression, anxiety and eating disorders. McKay-Dee becomes one of the few employers in the state to open an on-site daycare center for the children of employees. The center was located on the main floor of the hospital and children became a familiar sight around the facility. The daycare service continued in 2002 at the new McKay-Dee Hospital campus with care provided at the Child Development Center built near the hospital on campus. =1990s forward= On August 28, 1997, Intermountain Health Care and McKay-Dee announced plans to build a new hospital to replace the aging McKay-Dee. The project was proposed for of land about two blocks south of the existing hospital. The planning process for the new facility began with petitioning the Ogden City Planning Commission and City Council to approve a zoning change for the property. The request was eventually granted thanks to support from many of the surrounding neighbors. The Texas-based architectural firm of H.K.S. was selected from among 12 bidders to develop plans for the new McKay-Dee Hospital. The firm was ranked first in the country in the previous year for total dollars spent on new health care facilities. The firm also has ties with local design group, Design West. In January 2000, McKay-Dee Hospital was recognized by HCIA as one of the best hospitals in an eight-state mountain region. The survey of hospitals across the country is conducted annually by HICA Inc., a New York-based national health care research company. Ground was broken Wednesday, November 8, 2000 for the Child Development Center at the new McKay-Dee Hospital campus. The new center will occupy about 9,000 square feet (plus a playground) northwest of the main facility. It will accommodate 122 students compared to the current 65. The new McKay-Dee Hospital Center was opened March 20, 2002 with a red ribbon and fireworks. Operations at the 3939 Harrison Boulevard address for the previous McKay-Dee Hospital Center came to an end in the early morning hours of March 25, 2002. Eight ambulances lined up outside the Emergency Department just before 6 a.m., prepared to transport more than 150 patients to the new hospital. The transfer began with the most critical patients first. The new McKay-Dee welcomed its first baby at 11:29 a.m. One room away rested the parents of the last baby to be born at the old hospital, roughly 15 minutes before the patient move began. Hospital rating data The HealthGrades website contains the clinical quality data for Intermountain McKay-Dee Hospital, as of 2017. For this rating section three different types of data from HealthGrades are presented: clinical quality ratings for thirty- one inpatient conditions and procedures, thirteen patient safety indicators and the percentage of patients giving the hospital as a 9 or 10 (the two highest possible ratings). For inpatient conditions and procedures, there are three possible ratings: worse than expected, as expected, better than expected. For this hospital the data for this category is: *Worse than expected - 0 *As expected - 23 *Better than expected - 8 For patient safety indicators, there are the same three possible ratings. For this hospital safety indicators were rated as: *Worse than expected - 1 *As expected - 11 *Better than expected - 1 Percentage of patients rating this hospital as a 9 or 10 - 77% Percentage of patients who on average rank hospitals as a 9 or 10 - 69%HealthGrades website, https://www.healthgrades.com/hospital- directory/utah-ut/intermountain-mckay-dee-hospital-hgstb25cc8b6460004 .

Axis surface raiders and submarines periodically attacked shipping in Australian coastal waters from 1940 to early 1945 and Japanese aircraft bombed towns and airfields in Northern Australia on 97 occasions during 1942 and 1943. Papua New Guinea was part of Australia's overseas territories until 1975, so the large Japanese invasion in 1942 was a significant invasion of territory under Australian control. Naval attacks Six German surface raiders operated in Australian waters at different times between 1940 and 1943. These ships sank a small number of merchant ships and the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney. The German submarine U-862 also carried out attacks in Australian waters in late 1944 and early 1945. Japanese submarines operated in Australian waters from January 1942 until July 1944. Major submarine offensives were carried out against shipping off the Australian east coast from May to July 1942 and January to July 1943. On the evening of 31 May/morning of 1 June 1942, Sydney harbour came under direct attack from Japanese midget submarines. , a converted ferry being used as a troop sleeper, was hit and sunk. 22 sailors were killed, 19 Australians and 2 members of the Royal Navy. The only Japanese force to land in Australia during World War II was a reconnaissance party that landed in the Kimberley region of Western Australia on 19 January 1944 to investigate reports that the Allies were building large bases in the region. The party consisted of four Japanese officers on board a small fishing boat. It investigated the York Sound region for a day and a night before returning to Kupang in Timor on 20 January. Upon returning to Japan in February, the junior officer who commanded the party suggested using 200 Japanese prison inmates to launch a guerrilla campaign in Australia. Nothing came of this and the officer was posted to other duties. The single greatest loss of life resulting from a submarine attack in Australian waters occurred in the early hours of 14 May 1943 when the Japanese submarine I-177 torpedoed and sank the Australian hospital ship off Point Lookout, Queensland. After being hit by a single torpedo, Centaur sank in less than three minutes with the loss of 268 lives. While hospital ships such as Centaur were legally protected against attack under the terms of the Geneva Conventions, it is unclear whether Commander Hajime Nakagawa of I-177 was aware that Centaur was a hospital ship. While she was clearly marked with a red cross and was fully illuminated, the light conditions at the time may have resulted in Nakagawa not being aware of Centaurs status, making her sinking a tragic accident. However, as Nakagawa had a poor record as a submarine captain and was later convicted of machine gunning the survivors of a British merchant ship in the Indian Ocean, it is probable that the sinking of Centaur was due to either Nakagawa's incompetence or indifference to the laws of warfare. The attack on Centaur sparked widespread public outrage in Australia. Air attacks The first air raid on Australia occurred on 19 February 1942 when Darwin was attacked by 242 Japanese aircraft. At least 235 people were killed in the raid. Occasional attacks on northern Australian towns and airfields continued until November 1943. These included: * 64 raids on Darwin * 9 raids on Horn Island * 4 raids on Broome * 3 raids on Exmouth Gulf * 3 raids on Townsville.

In June 2008, she was selected to join Karen Cockburn and Jason Burnett as one of Canada's three trampoline gymnasts at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In the trampoline preliminary competition, she qualified in 3rd place for the Finals but eventually finished in 7th place. After the 2008 Olympics, MacLennan won the 2009 Canadian Women's Individual title. She came in 4th place for individual trampoline in the 2009 Trampoline World Championships in St Petersburg and 3rd place for individual trampoline in the 2010 Trampoline World Championships in Metz. In 2011, she again won the Canadian Championships and came in 1st place at the Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico and 2nd place in the 2011 Trampoline World Championships in Birmingham which won a place for Canadian women in the Trampoline event for the 2012 London Olympics. She obtained a Bachelor of Physical and Health Education degree from the University of Toronto in November 2011 and is returning to University of Toronto's Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education to pursue a master's degree. Her next major competition was at the 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event, held in the same location as the Olympics. MacLennan won that event against some of the Olympic competitors that she would later face. In May 2012 she suffered a concussion and had to be cautious in her training, missing the 2012 Canadian Trampoline Championships. However at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, she put on her best performance ever with a finals routine of 57.305, which was the gold-medal winning score for Canada. This was the first and only gold medal for Canada at these games and the first Canadian trampoline gold medal ever. She commented on her gold medal performance: \\"I was shocked. It's the biggest score that I've ever gotten and I knew that it would be a tough one to catch. But you never want to get ahead of yourself, you want to wait until all the competitors are done.\\" There were three competitors left to compete. The two Chinese competitors were both considered good gold medal prospects, but neither managed to beat her score, confirming the gold for MacLennan. China's He Wenna fell at the end of her performance but narrowly beat out MacLennan's Canadian teammate Karen Cockburn for the bronze medal. MacLennan's result as Canada's only gold-medal winner brought out support in Canada for her to be the nation's flagbearer for the closing ceremony; however, soccer player Christine Sinclair was eventually given the honour, to a little controversy. In November 2013 MacLennan won the gold medal at the World Championship in Sofia, Bulgaria. In May 2014, MacLennan won the Canadian National Championship in Ottawa.MacLennan, Burnett win trampoline gold at Canadian gymnastics championships During training before the 2015 Pan American Games, she sustained a mild concussion when she landed on the side of a trampoline. She won the women's trampoline event at the Pan American Games two weeks later, then undertook physical and cognitive rest to recover from the concussion.

He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals (1972, 1974) and Detroit Tigers (1975‚Äì77). Amateur career Born in Miami, Florida, Bare was drafted four times before finally signing. In June 1967, he was drafted out of Southwest Miami High School by the Washington Senators in the 14th round of the amateur draft, but did not sign. In January 1968, and again in June 1968, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians, but did not sign either time. He finally signed with the Cardinals after being drafted in February 1969. Professional career =Early years with St. Louis= In 1972, Bare appeared in 14 games as a relief pitcher for the Cardinals, allowing only one earned run for a minuscule 0.54 ERA. Bare spent most of the 1973 and 1974 seasons with the Tulsa Oilers of the American Association. In 1974, Bare went 12‚Äì4 for the Oilers with a league-best 2.34 ERA. He was then called up to the Cardinals and had a 1‚Äì2 record (5.92 ERA) for the 1974 Cardinals. =With the Tigers= 1975 season On April 4, 1975, Bare was selected off waivers by the Detroit Tigers. Bare was put into the starting rotation for the pitching- starved 1975 Detroit Tigers ‚Äì a team that lost 102 games. Bare had an 8‚Äì13 record and a 4.48 ERA in 150 innings for the Tigers in 1975. On May 1, Bare got his first decision in a 17‚Äì3 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers; Bare gave five earned runs in just two innings, allowing two triples and two doubles (by Hank Aaron and Robin Yount). The following week, Bare got his first win for Detroit, a 6‚Äì4 decision against the same Brewers team. On June 4, pitched a strong game against the Angels, giving up only six hits and two earned runs, but taking the loss as the Tigers scored only once. On June 19, Bare lost, 9‚Äì2, to Catfish Hunter and the Yankees, as Bare gave up 13 hits and six earned runs in 6 innings. Bare took a tough loss on June 29, as he allowed only four hits and two earned runs in 7 innings, but the Orioles won, 2‚Äì1. On August 16, Bare pitched his best game of the season, a two-hit complete game shutout against the Angels, with the Tigers scoring eight runs to back him up. This game also ended a 19-game losing streak for the Tigers. 1976 season Bare returned to the Tigers starting lineup in 1976 with a 7‚Äì8 record and 3.70 ERA in 134 innings. On April 18, Bare got a win in his first start of the season, a 6‚Äì2 decision over the Angels. In his next start, Bare gave up six runs in 6 innings on April 23, then was crushed by the White Sox, 8‚Äì4, on April 30, giving up five earned runs in four innings. Then, after two poor starts, Bare pitched the best game of his career on May 7, a complete game one-hit shutout against the Chicago White Sox. The White Sox only hit off Bare was a single by Ralph Garr in the fourth inning. Continuing his inconsistent pitching, Bare did not make it out of the first inning in his next start, giving up four runs, including a home run by Graig Nettles in of an inning. On May 21, Bare failed to make it out of the first inning yet again, giving up three hits, two walks, and six runs (including a Doug DeCinces home run) in of an inning against the Orioles. Five days later, Bare held the same Orioles squad to two earned runs and got the win in a 6‚Äì2 Tigers victory. Bare had a strong outing against the White Sox on July 22, 1976, as the Tigers won 5‚Äì1, and Bare allowed only five hits and one run in 7 innings. Bare got his final major league win on September 10, 1976 at Fenway Park. He shut out the Red Sox in a rain-shortened five-inning game, as the Tigers won, 1‚Äì0. Ben Oglivie hit a home run to win it for Bare and the Tigers. 1977 season In 1977, Bare's ERA ballooned to 12.56 in 14 innings. On April 9, in the second game of the Tigers season, Bare gave up five runs in two innings against the Royals, as the Royals went on to beat the Tigers, 16‚Äì2. On April 14, Bare pitched well, giving up only one earned run in seven innings, but the Tigers lost the game as John Hiller gave up three runs in relief of Bare. In his third start of the season on April 19, Bare was blasted, allowing five earned runs in only 1 innings against the Red Sox. Bare got his final Major League start on April 27, allowing six earned runs in four innings against the White Sox. On May 3, Bare gave up three earned runs pitching in relief against the Rangers without retiring a single batter. With that, the Tigers had enough, and Bare was sent down to the minor leagues, and finished the season with the Triple-A Evansville Triplets. =With the Orioles= The Tigers let Bare go after the season, and he was signed by the Baltimore Orioles. He pitched for their top farm club, the Rochester Red Wings, in 1978, compiling a record of 7‚Äì13 with a 4.05 ERA in what proved to be his last professional season.

The Great French Wine Blight was a severe blight of the mid-19th century that destroyed many of the vineyards in France and laid waste the wine industry. It was caused by an aphid (the actual genus of the aphid is still debated, although it is largely considered to have been a species of Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, commonly known as grape phylloxera) that originated in North America and was carried across the Atlantic in the late 1850s. While France is considered to have been worst affected, the blight also did a great deal of damage to vineyards in other European countries. How the Phylloxera aphid was introduced to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration of the possibility of the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip. Eventually, following Jules-√âmile Planchon's discovery of the Phylloxera as the cause of the blight,G. Bazille, J.-E. Planchon and Sahut (1868) \\"Sur une maladie de la vigne actuellement r√©gnante en Provence\\" (On a disease of grapevines presently prevailing in Provence), Comptes rendus, 67 : 333‚Äì336. and Charles Valentine Riley's confirmation of Planchon's theory, Leo Laliman and Gaston Bazille, two French wine growers, proposed that the European vines be grafted to the resistant American rootstock that were not susceptible to the Phylloxera. While many of the French wine growers disliked this idea, many found themselves with no other option. The method proved to be an effective remedy. The \\"Reconstitution\\" (as it was termed) of the many vineyards that had been lost was a slow process, but eventually the wine industry in France was able to return to relative normality.  Background  The grape phylloxera responsible for the failure of the French colonist's plantations in Florida, and probably the later destroyer of the French wine industry. The aphid that was the central source of the damage in France was first noted following the growing of the European vine Vitis vinifera by French colonists in Florida, in the 16th century. These plantations were a failure, and later experiments with related species of vine also failed, although the reason for these failures appears to have been a mystery to the French colonists. It is known today that it was a species of North American grape phylloxera that caused these early vineyards to fail; the venom injected by the Phylloxera causes a disease that is quickly fatal to the European varieties of vine.Ellen M. Harkness, Richard P. Vine, Sally J. Linton Winemaking: From Grape Growing to Marketplace. Springer, 2002. The aphids initially went unnoticed by the colonists, despite their great numbers, and the pressure to successfully start a vineyard in America at the time. It became common knowledge among the settlers that their European vines, of the vinifera variety, simply would not grow in American soil, and they resorted to growing Native American plants, and established plantations of these native vines. Exceptions did exist; vinifera plantations were well-established in California before the aphids found their way there. = Phylloxera = There have been several theories proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease that resulted in the failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots.Ted Henzell Australian Agriculture: Its History and Challenges. CSIRO Publishing, 2007. The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant.Ordish, George. The Great Wine Blight. Pan Macmillan, 1987. = Journey to Europe = For a few centuries, Europeans had experimented with American vines and plants in their soil, and many varieties were imported from America without regulation, disregarding the possibility of pest transfer, and related problems. Jules- Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, and this is how the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860,Phylloxera, from The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2004 although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.  The blight  Diagram of the roots of a Vitis vinifera damaged by the aphid. = Initial appearance = The first known documented instance of an attack by the Phylloxera in France was in the village of Pujaut in the department of Gard of the former province of Languedoc, in 1863.Viticulture: An Introduction to Commercial Grape Growing for Wine Production. Published 2007. (Pierre-Adolphe Menudier) (2 August 1879) \\"The Phylloxera in France,\\" Scientific American, new series, 41 (5) : 72‚Äì73; see p. 72. The wine makers there did not notice the aphids, just as the French colonists in America had not, but they noted the mysterious blight that was damaging their vines. The only description of the disease that was given by these wine growers was that it 'reminded them distressingly of \\"consumption\\"' (tuberculosis). The blight quickly spread throughout France, but it was several years before the cause of the disease was determined. Charles Valentine Riley in 1870 confirmed the theory proposed by Planchon. = Damage = Over 40% of French grape vines and vineyards were devastated over a 15-year period, from the late 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused problems for the domestic industry that threatened to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy is estimated to have been slightly over 10 billion Francs. = Discovery = Research into identifying the cause of the disease began in 1868, when grape growers in Roquemaure, near Pujaut, asked the agricultural society in Montpellier for help.W. Conner Sorensen, Edward H. Smith, Janet Smith, and Yves Carton (Fall 2008) \\"Charles V. Riley, France, and Phylloxera,\\" American Entomologist, 54 (3): 134‚Äì149. Available on-line at: Entomological Society of America To investigate the disease, the society appointed a committee consisting of botanist Jules √âmile Planchon, local grower Felix Sahut, and the society's president, Gaston Bazille, among others. Sahut soon noticed that the roots of dying vines were infested with \\"lice\\",See: * Carton, Yves (2006) \\"La d√©couvert du Phylloxera en France: Un sujet de pol√©mique: les archives parlent (Hemiptera, Chermesidae)\\" (The discovery of Phylloxera in France: a controversial subject: the archives speak (Hemiptera, Chermesidae)), Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© entomologique de France, 111 (3) : 305‚Äì316.

From p. 29: \\" ‚Ä¶ j'eus la pens√©e de faire arracher des racines sur les vignes d√©j√† atteintes pour les examiner attentivement ‚Ä¶ En promenant ma loupe sur l'√©piderme de ces racines de vigne, je d√©couvris ainsi quelques petits points jaunes que je montrai imm√©diatement √† M.

The committee named the new insect Rhizaphis vastatrix.(Bazille et al., 1868), p. 336. Planchon consulted French entomologists Victor Antoine Signoret and Jules Lichtenstein (Planchon's brother-in-law). Signoret suggested renaming the insect Phylloxera vastatrix, due to its similarity to Phylloxera quercus, which afflicted oak leaves.Planchon, J. E. (14 September 1868) \\"Nouvelles observations sur le puceron de la vigne (Phylloxera vastratix (nuper Rhizaphis, Planch.))\\" (New observations on the vine aphid (Phylloxera vastratix (recently Rhizaphis, Planch.))), Comptes rendus, 67 : 588‚Äì594. In 1869, English entomologist John Obadiah Westwood suggested that an insect that had afflicted grape leaves in England circa 1863 was the same insect afflicting grape vines' roots in France.Westwood, J. O. (30 January 1869) \\"New vine diseases,\\" Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, 45 : 109. Also in 1869, Lichtenstein suggested that the French insect was an American \\"vine louse\\" that had been identified in 1855 by the American entomologist Asa Fitch, which he'd named Pemphigus vitifoliae.\\"Renseignements divers sur le Phylloxera vastatrix (Planchon), la maladie nouvelle de la vigne et les rem√®des propos√©s\\" (Various information on Phylloxera vastatrix (Planchon), the new vine disease and proposed remedies), Insectologie Agricole, 3 (7) : 184‚Äì192 (1869); see especially page 189. However, there was a problem with these suggestions: French grape lice were known to infest only a vine's roots, whereas American grape lice were known to infest only its leaves.See: * Page 74 of: George Gale, \\"Chapter 4: Saving the vine from Phylloxera: A never- ending battle,\\" pp. 70‚Äì91 ; in: Merton Sandler and Roger Pindler, ed.s, Wine: A Scientific Exploration (Boca Raton, Florida, USA: CRC Press, 2002). * (Sorensen, 2008), p. 137. The British-born American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley had been following news of the outbreak in France. He sent Signoret specimens of American grape lice, which Signoret concluded ‚Äì in 1870, while besieged in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War ‚Äì were indeed identical to French grape lice.Page 86 in: \\"The grape-leaf gall-louse ‚Äì Phylloxera vitifoliae, Fitch.\\" in: Charles V. Riley, Third Annual Report on the Noxious, Beneficial and Other Insects of the State of Missouri, ‚Ä¶ in: Chas. W. Murtfeldt, ed., Sixth Annual Report of the [Missouri] State Board of Agriculture ‚Ä¶ (Jefferson City, Missouri: Horace Wilcox, 1871). Meanwhile, Planchon and Lichtenstein had found vines with afflicted leaves; lice that were transferred from those leaves to the roots of healthy vines attached themselves to the vines' roots as other French grape lice did.J. E. Planchon and J. Lichtenstein (11 August 1870) \\"De l'identit√© sp√©cifique du phylloxera des feuilles et du phylloxera des racines de la vigne\\" (The identity of the phylloxera of the leaves and the phylloxera of the roots of vines), Journal d'Agriculture Pratique, 34 (2) : 181‚Äì182. Also in 1870, Riley discovered that American grape lice wintered on American grape vines' roots, which the insects damaged, albeit less than in the case of French vines. Using American grape vines and American grape lice, Riley also repeated Planchon and Lichtenstein's experiment, with similar results.Riley, Third Annual Report on the Noxious, Beneficial and Other Insects of the State of Missouri, ‚Ä¶ (1871), p. 86. Thus the identity of the French and American grape lice was proved. Nevertheless, for another three years, a powerful majority in France argued that Phylloxera was not the cause of vine disease; instead, vines that were already sickly became infested with Phylloxera. Thus, in their opinion, Phylloxera was merely a consequence of the \\"true\\" disease, which remained to be found.See: * (Gale, 2002), pp. 71‚Äì73. * (Sorensen et al., 2008), p. 138. * (Barral, Jean-Augustin) (20 September 1868) \\"VI.

Regardless, Riley had discovered American grape varieties that were especially resistant to Phylloxera, and by 1871, French farmers began to import them and graft French vines onto the American rootstock.See: * Riley, C. V. (December 1870) \\"The grape-leaf gall-louse (Phylloxera vitifoliae, Fitch.),\\" The American Entomologist and Botanist, 2 (12) : 353‚Äì359; see p. 356. * See pp. 63‚Äì64 in: \\"Grape disease: On the cause of deterioration in some of our native grape- vines, and one of the probable reasons why European vines have so generally failed with us\\" ; in: Charles V.

Wielandy, ed., Seventh Annual Report of the [Missouri] State Board of Agriculture, ‚Ä¶ for the Year 1871 (Jefferson City, Missouri: Regan & Edwards, 1872). (Leo Laliman had suggested importing American vines as early as 1869, but French farmers were reluctant to abandon their traditional varieties. Gaston Bazille then proposed grafting traditional French vines onto American rootstock.(Sorensen et al., 2008), p. 139.) However, importation of American vines did not entirely solve the problem: some American grape varieties struggled in France's chalky soils and succumbed to Phylloxera.(Sorensen et al., 2008), p. 141. By trial and error, American vines were found that could tolerate chalky soils.(Gale, 2002), pp. 82‚Äì83. Meanwhile, entomologists worked to unravel the strange life cycle of Phylloxera, a project that was completed in 1874. = Solution = Many growers resorted to their own methods in attempt to resolve the issue. Chemicals and pesticides were used to no avail. In desperation, some growers positioned toads under each vine, and others allowed their poultry to roam free in the hope they would eat the insects.Ken Kincaid, Peter Knaup Chateaux of the Medoc: The Great Wines of Bordeaux. I.B.Tauris, 2000. . Page 23 None of these methods was successful. After Charles Valentine Riley, Missouri's state entomologist, confirmed Planchon's theory, Leo Laliman and Gaston Bazille, two French wine growers, both suggested the possibility that if vinifera vines could be combined, by means of grafting, with the aphid-resistant American vines, then the problem might be solved. Thomas Volney Munson was consulted and provided native Texan rootstocks for grafting. Because of Munson's role, the French government in 1888 sent a delegation to Denison, Texas to confer on him the French Legion of Honor Chevalier du M√©rite Agricole.Texas State Historical Association http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmu08 The method was tested, and proved a success.Allan J. Tobin, Jennie Dusheck Asking about Life. Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2004. . Page 628 The process was colloquially termed \\"reconstitution\\" by French wine growers. The cure for the disease caused a great division in the wine industry: some, who became known as the \\"chemists\\", rejected the grafting solution and persisted with the use of pesticides and chemicals. Those who became grafters were known as \\"Americanists\\", or \\"wood merchants\\". Following the demonstrated success of grafting in the 1870s and 1880s the immense task of \\"reconstituting\\" the majority of France's vineyards began.  Prize  The French government had offered over 320,000 Francs as a reward to whoever could discover a cure for the blight. Having reportedly been the first to suggest the possibility of using the resistant American rootstock, Leo Laliman tried to claim the money, but the French government refused to award it, with the rationale that he had not cured the blight, but rather stopped it from occurring. However, there may have been other reasons for the government denying Laliman the prize: he was mistrusted by several notable parties, and he was thought by many to have originally introduced the pest. A vineyard in present-day France.  Present day  There is still no remedy, as such, for the Phylloxera, or the disease it brings with it, and it still poses a substantial threat to any vineyard not planted with grafted rootstock.Leo A. Loub√®re Radicalism in Mediterranean France: Its Rise and Decline, 1848‚Äì1914. SUNY Press, 1974. There is only one European grape vine known to be resistant to the Phylloxera, the Assyrtiko vine, which grows on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini; however there is speculation that the actual source of this resistance may arise from the volcanic ash in which the vines grow, and not from the vine itself.Thom Elkjer Adventures in Wine: True Stories of Vineyards and Vintages Around the World. Travelers' Tales, 2002. There still exist some vines which have been neither grafted nor destroyed by phylloxera, including some owned by Bollinger.

Description  TOSH specialize in sports medicine, sports biomechanics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, athletic training, nutrition, biomechanical engineering, exercise and sports physiology. It is one of the country's premier facilities for orthopedic care. TOSH is the official sports medicine provider for the U.S. Ski and Snowboard teams, the U.S. Speedskating team, and was recently designated an official training site for Olympic athletes. TOSH has its own inpatient facility and the physicians at TOSH perform major surgery, including total knee, shoulder and hip replacements. Many of the cutting-edge techniques and devices used at TOSH were developed there, and are now used worldwide.  History  In 2007, TOSH and USANA Health Sciences formed an informal research partnership. In 2009 this partnership was formalized, and the two entities began formal research collaboration. In 2009, TOSH customized one of its performance labs for soccer players. High-speed cameras analyze movements of players kicking soccer balls and give feedback on movements and feet positioning. Specially designed glasses with built-in strobe lights train eyes what is often overlooked with a fast-moving ball. A Nike visual training system, one of only 20 in the country, is also used to strengthen peripheral vision. In July 2010, TOSH and USANA Health Sciences announced the launch of two new vitamin studies. The first study is to determine whether Vitamin D can reduce post-exercise muscular weakness in young, physically active people. The second study involves patients at TOSH with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries to find a complementary therapeutic approach for improving muscular strength in post-surgical patients utilizing both Vitamin C and Vitamin E. These studies are part of a research partnership between the two entities that began in 2007 and was formalized in 2009. USANA provided the pharmaceutical- grade supplements for both of the studies, as well as provided partial funding to the ACL study. In 2010, TOSH opened their Back & Neck Center which was designed to rapidly assess back and neck pain, including any necessary diagnostic imaging services. Major problems are diagnosed at this Center and then patients are passed onto specialists near their residence.

Structure and function  Skp2 contains 424 residues in total with the ~40 amino acid F-box domain lying closer to the N-terminal region at the 94-140 position and the C-terminal region forming a concave surface consisting of ten leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which often‚Äîbut not always‚Äîrecognize substrates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In this SCF complex, Skp2 acts as the substrate recognition factor. =F-box Domain= The F-box proteins are divided into three classes: Fbxws containing WD40 repeat domains, Fbxls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxos containing either different protein‚Äìprotein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxls class. In addition to an F-box, this protein contains 10 tandem leucine-rich repeats. Alternative splicing of this gene generates 2 transcript variants encoding different isoforms. After the tenth LRR, the ~30-residue C-terminal tail turns back towards the first LRR, forming what has been referred to as a ‚Äòsafety-belt‚Äô that might aid to pin down substrates into the concave surface formed by the LRRs. Skp2 forms a stable complex with the cyclin A-CDK2 S-phase kinase. It specifically recognizes and promotes the degradation of phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B, also referred to as p27 or KIP1) predominantly in S, G2 phase, and the initial part of the M phase. The degradation of p27 via Skp2 requires the accessory protein CKS1B. To prevent premature degradation of p27, Skp2 levels are kept low during early and mid-G1 due to the APC/CCdh1ubiquitin ligase, which mediates the ubiquitylation of Skp2. Phosphorylation of Ser64 and, to a lesser extent, Ser72 of Skp2 contributes to the stabilization of Skp2 by preventing its association with APC/CCdh1; however, Skp2 phosphorylation on these residues is dispensable for its subcellular localization and for Skp2 assembly into an active SCF ubiquitin ligase. = Role in cell cycle regulation = Progression through the cell cycle is tightly regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and their interactions with cyclins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs). Relative amounts of these signals oscillate during each stage of the cell cycle due to periodic proteolysis; the ubiquitin-proteasome system mediates the degradation of these mitotic regulatory proteins, controlling their intracellular concentrations. These and other proteins are recognized and degraded by the proteasome from the sequential action of three enzymes: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), one of many E2s (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and one of many E3 ubiquitin ligase. The specificity of ubiquitination is provided by the E3 ligases; these ligases physically interact with the target substrates. Skp2 is the substrate recruiting component of the SCFSkp2 complex, which targets cell cycle control elements, such as p27 and p21. Here, SKP2 has been implicated in double negative feedback loops with both p21 and p27, that control cell cycle entry and G1/S transition.  Clinical significance  Skp2 behaves as an oncogene in cell systems and is an established protooncogene causally involved in the pathogenesis of lymphomas. One of the most critical CDK inhibitors involved in cancer pathogenesis is p27Kip1, which is involved primarily in inhibiting cyclin E-CDK2 complexes (and to a lesser extent cyclin D-CDK4 complexes). Levels of p27Kip1 (like all other CKIs) rise and fall in cells as they either exit or re-enter the cell cycle, these levels are not modulated at the transcriptional level, but by the actions of the SCFSkp2 complex in recognizing p27Kip1 and tagging it for destruction in the proteasome system. It has been shown that as cells enter G0 phase, reducing levels of Skp2 explain the increase in p27Kip1, creating an apparent inverse relationship between Skp2 and p27Kip1. Robust evidence has been amassed that strongly suggests Skp2 plays an important role in cancer. =Overexpression= Overexpression of Skp2 is frequently observed in human cancer progression and metastasis, and evidence suggests that Skp2 plays a proto-oncogenic role both in vitro and in vivo. Skp2 overexpression has been seen in: lymphomas, prostate cancer, melanoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and breast carcinomas. Additionally, overexpression of Skp2 is correlated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer. As one would expect, Skp2 overexpression promotes growth and tumorigenesis in a xenograft tumor model. By extension of this fact, Skp2 inactivation profoundly restricts cancer development by triggering a massive cellular senescence and/or apoptosis response that is surprisingly observed only in oncogenic conditions in vivo. This response is triggered in a p19Arf/p53-independent, but p27-dependent manner. Using a Skp2 knockout mouse model, multiple groups have shown Skp2 is required for cancer development in different conditions of tumor promotion, including PTEN, ARF, pRB in activation as well as Her2/Neu overexpression. Genetic approaches have demonstrated that Skp2 deficiency inhibits cancer development in multiple mouse models by inducing p53-independent cellular senescence and blocking Akt- mediated aerobic glycolysis. Akt activation by Skp2 is linked to aerobic glycolysis, as Skp2 deficiency impairs Akt activation, Glut1 expression, and glucose uptake thereby promoting cancer development. = Potential use as a clinical target = Skp2 is of considerable interest as a novel and attractive target for cancer therapeutical development, as disrupting the SCF complex will result in increased levels of p27, which will inhibit aberrant cellular proliferation. Although Skp2 is an enzyme, its function requires the assembly of the other members of the SCF complex. As Skp2 is the rate-limiting component of the SCF complex, effective inhibitors should be focused on the interfaces of Skp2 with the other members of the SCF complex, which is much more difficult than traditional enzyme inhibition. Small molecule inhibitors of the binding site between Skp2 and its substrate p27 have been discovered, and these inhibitors induce p27 accumulation in a Skp2-dependent manner and promote cell cycle arrest. Another recent discovery were inhibitors of the Skp1/Skp2 interface that resulted in: restoring p27 levels, suppressing survival, trigger p53-independent senescence, exhibit potent antitumor activity in multiple animal models, and were also found to affect Akt-mediated glycolysis. Skp2 is a potential target for pten-deficient cancers.  Interactions  SKP2 has been shown to interact with: * CCNA2, * CDK2, * CDKN1A * CDKN1B * CKS1B, * CDT1, * CUL1 * E2F1, * ORC1L, and * SKP1A.

History A group of Sisters of the Order of St. Benedict traveled to the foothills east of Ogden, Utah, and founded the first St. Benedict's Hospital at 3000 Polk, which opened on September 18, 1946. Their own philosophy, ‚Äúcaring for the sick as if they were Christ in person,‚Äù is taken from the Rule of St. Benedict by which the Sisters lived. Due to expansion, a new hospital in Washington Terrace was dedicated in 1977. The construction of the new hospital on its new campus led to the development of several medical office buildings. These buildings housed numerous hospital programs while providing convenient office space for many physicians and related health care activities. In July 1977, the Val A. Browning Radiation Therapy Center, now called the Val A. Browning Cancer Treatment Center, opened its doors to treat cancer patients from throughout Northern Utah and surrounding states. As a result, St. Benedict's helped organize the Hospice of Northern Utah for terminally ill patients and their relatives. On Mother's Day, 1992, they opened a new Women's and Children's Center, which also housed OB/GYN and pediatric physician offices. A new neonatal intensive care unit had opened previously in November 1987. The hospital has continued to grow and has invested millions of dollars in advanced equipment and facilities. Modern technologies have become a part of everyday procedures. To further strengthen its cardiology program, the cardiac catheterization lab was upgraded, allowing the hospital to implement its nationally rated open-heart surgery program. St. Benedict's has been affiliated with various organizations. Since 1995, the hospital, now called Ogden Regional Medical Center, has been part of what is now Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), the world's largest hospital company. In May 2000, Ogden Regional Medical Center joined with five other HCA-affiliated hospitals in Utah to announce a new network named MountainStar Healthcare.

Together with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, PPAR-alpha is part of the subfamily of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. It was the first member of the PPAR family to be cloned in 1990 by Stephen Green and has been identified as the nuclear receptor for a diverse class of rodent hepatocarcinogens that causes proliferation of peroxisomes.  Expression  PPAR-alpha is primarily activated through ligand binding. Endogenous ligands include fatty acids such as arachidonic acid as well as other polyunsaturated fatty acids and various fatty acid-derived compounds such as certain members of the 15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid family of arachidonic acid metabolites, e.g. 15(S)-HETE, 15(R)-HETE, and 15(S)-HpETE and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, a linoleic acid metabolite. Many of the effects of palmitoleic acid are due to its activation of PPAR-alpha. Synthetic ligands include the fibrate drugs, which are used to treat hyperlipidemia, and a diverse set of insecticides, herbicides, plasticizers, and organic solvents collectively referred to as peroxisome proliferators.  Function  Mouse liver PPARalpha transcriptome Human hepatocyte PPARalpha transcriptome PPAR-alpha is a transcription factor and a major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver. PPAR-alpha is activated under conditions of energy deprivation and is necessary for the process of ketogenesis, a key adaptive response to prolonged fasting. Activation of PPAR-alpha promotes uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids by upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid transport, fatty acid binding and activation, and peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation.  Tissue distribution  Expression of PPAR-alpha is highest in tissues that oxidize fatty acids at a rapid rate. In rodents, highest mRNA expression levels of PPAR-alpha are found in liver and brown adipose tissue, followed by heart and kidney. Lower PPAR-alpha expression levels are found in small and large intestine, skeletal muscle and adrenal gland. Human PPAR-alpha seems to be expressed more equally among various tissues, with high expression in liver, intestine, heart, and kidney.  Knockout studies  Studies using mice lacking functional PPAR-alpha indicate that PPAR-alpha is essential for induction of peroxisome proliferation by a diverse set of synthetic compounds referred to as peroxisome proliferators. Mice lacking PPAR-alpha also have an impaired response to fasting, characterized by major metabolic perturbations including low plasma levels of ketone bodies, hypoglycemia, and fatty liver.  Pharmacology  PPAR-alpha is the pharmaceutical target of fibrates, a class of drugs used in the treatment of dyslipidemia. Fibrates effectively lower serum triglycerides and raises serum HDL-cholesterol levels. Although clinical benefits of fibrate treatment have been observed, the overall results are mixed and have led to reservations about the broad application of fibrates for the treatment of coronary heart disease, in contrast to statins. PPAR- alpha agonists may carry therapeutic value for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. PPAR-alpha may also be a site of action of certain anticonvulsants.  Target genes  PPAR-alpha governs biological processes by altering the expression of a large number of target genes. Accordingly, the functional role of PPAR-alpha is directly related to the biological function of its target genes. Gene expression profiling studies have indicated that PPAR-alpha target genes number in the hundreds. Classical target genes of PPAR-alpha include PDK4, ACOX1, and CPT1. Low and high throughput gene expression analysis have allowed the creation of comprehensive maps illustrating the role of PPAR-alpha as master regulator of lipid metabolism via regulation of numerous genes involved in various aspects of lipid metabolism. These maps, constructed for mouse liver and human liver, put PPAR- alpha at the center of a regulatory hub impacting fatty acid uptake and intracellular binding, mitochondrial Œ≤-oxidation and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, triglyceride turnover, gluconeogenesis, and bile synthesis/secretion.  Interactions  Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha has been shown to interact with: * AIP, * EP300 * HSP90AA1, * NCOA1, and * NCOR1.

The French repulsed every attempt to seize the fortress, resulting in Wellington's withdrawal. The siege took place during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Burgos is located about north of Madrid. After having soundly defeated Marshal Auguste Marmont's French army at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, Wellington exploited his great victory by advancing on Madrid. King Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jean- Baptiste Jourdan retreated to Valencia where they sought refuge with Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet. The magnitude of Wellington's triumph also compelled Marshal Nicolas Soult to evacuate Andalucia in the south and withdraw to Valencia. The combined armies of Soult and Joseph soon posed a serious menace to Wellington's grasp on Madrid. The recently defeated French army in the north also built up its strength. Wellington made plans to counter the southern French threat while hoping to quickly capture the strategically important Burgos position, which was an important French supply base. Instead, Dubreton led a masterful defense, thwarting Wellington's assaults time after time. The British commander's hopes were blasted when his attempts to contain the twin French counteroffensives failed. With large French relief armies approaching Burgos from the northeast and Madrid from the southeast, the British commander withdrew to the west, abandoning large areas of Spain that had been recently liberated. That fall the French lost an opportunity to defeat Wellington's army. Nevertheless, during the withdrawal to Portugal the Anglo-Portuguese army lost many men to pursuing French cavalry and starvation. Background Wellington's victory over Marshal Marmont at the Battle of Salamanca on 22 July 1812 gravely weakened the French position in Spain. Before the engagement, King Joseph had set out with 14,000 troops, intending to reinforce the marshal, who was unaware that help was on the way. On 25 July, Joseph received a report from the wounded Marmont which covered up the extent of the disaster. Soon, General of Division Clausel reported the true state of affairs. He wrote to the king, \\"armies usually suffer in morale after a setback, [but] it is hard to understand the extent of discouragement existing in this one. I cannot conceal that a very bad spirit prevails. Disorders and the most revolting excesses mark every stage of our retreat.\\" Joseph immediately withdrew toward Madrid. Desperate to salvage the situation, the king ordered Marshal Nicolas Soult to send help and to evacuate Andalucia, but the marshal refused.Gates (2002), p. 360-361 On 30 July, Wellington's army reached Valladolid, northwest of Madrid. Leaving 18,000 troops with Lieutenant General Henry Clinton to watch Clausel, the British army commander turned toward Madrid with 36,000 men. On 11 August, General of Division Anne- Fran√ßois-Charles Trelliard's dragoon division fought an inconclusive skirmish with the Allies at the Battle of Majadahonda northwest of Madrid. At first, the French dragoons routed Brigadier General Benjamin d'Urban's Portuguese cavalry. After also driving back Major General George Bock's King's German Legion (KGL) heavy dragoons, the French were finally stopped by fire from the 1st KGL Light Infantry Battalion and the approach of heavy reinforcements. King Joseph evacuated Madrid which the Anglo-Portuguese entered on 12 August, to the cheers of the inhabitants.Gates (2002), p. 361 The following day, the Retiro forts were put under siege and 24 hours later they surrendered to Wellington, yielding 2,046 prisoners, large stocks of clothing and equipment, including 20,000 muskets and 180 brass cannon as well as the eagles of the 13th Dragoon and the 51st Line Infantry Regiments.Smith (1998), p. 386 Harassed by guerillas and tortured by thirst, Joseph's soldiers retreated all the way to the east coast city of Valencia, which they reached on 31 August. Valencia was held by Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet. Wellington knew that if Joseph and Soult joined forces, his position in central Spain would become perilous. He counted on the autumn rains keeping the Tagus River high and preventing Joseph and Soult from threatening his southern flank. He hoped that the Spanish might delay any French counterattack toward Madrid. He also believed that the capture of Burgos would slow any French drive from the north.Glover (2001), p. 209 To Wellington's amazement, Clausel quickly rallied his beaten army and launched a raid in the north. On 13 August, the French general marched on Valladolid with 25,000 troops. In the face of this advance, Clinton fell back to Ar√©valo with 7,000 soldiers while Jos√© Mar√≠a Santocildes's Spanish corps abandoned Valladolid. Clausel sent his lieutenant Maximilien Sebastien Foy to rescue the trapped French garrisons. While the Spanish attackers concluded the Siege of Astorga before he could reach it, Foy rescued the garrisons of Toro and Zamora and reunited with Clausel at Valladolid on 4 September. Wellington and 21,000 troops rejoined Clinton at Ar√©valo on 3 September. The British army commander set out after Clausel, but that general easily shook off his pursuers and dashed out of reach, leaving a garrison of 2,000 men in Burgos.Gates (2002), pp. 365-366 Wellington left Lieutenant General Rowland Hill to defend Madrid with 31,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 12,000 Spanish.Glover (2001), p. 212 This force included Wellington's three best divisions. Siege =San Miguel Hornwork= Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington The 35,000-man Anglo-Portuguese-Spanish army laid siege to the castle of Burgos on 19 September. General of Brigade Jean-Louis Dubreton commanded two battalions of the 34th Line Infantry Regiment, one battalion of the 130th Line, one artillery company, one sapper company, nine heavy cannons, 11 field pieces, and six mortars, altogether 2,000 troops.Smith (1998), p. 397 The inner Burgos defenses contained a stronghold known as the Napoleon Battery. Historians differ as to how many heavy guns Wellington had available. Michael Glover wrote that the British had only three 18-pound cannon with 1,306 rounds.Glover (2001), p. 210 David Gates asserted that Wellington only brought eight siege guns though many more recently captured pieces were available.Gates (2002), p. 366 Chris McNab credited the British with having a total of eight 24-pound guns. Admiral Sir Home Popham of the Royal Navy offered to land more heavy guns at Santander, but Wellington declined to use this resource. After costly assaults at the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, he was loath to mount a massive infantry attack. At the time, the British army's sapper corps, then called Military Artificers, was seriously understrength. At Burgos, there were only five engineer officers and eight sappers. During the siege operation, one engineer and one of the sappers was killed, two engineers were wounded and all the other seven sappers were wounded. Wellington ordered an assault on the San Miguel hornwork, which guarded the fort's northeast approaches for the night of 19 September. Launched without the benefit of artillery support, there were three simultaneous assaults, the 1st Battalion of the 42nd Foot was spotted by the French in the moonlight and over 200 men were mowed down. Brigadier General Denis Pack's Portuguese brigade suffered an additional 100 losses.Gates (2002), pp. 366-369 The British flank companies of the 1st/42nd Foot, 1st/24th Foot, and 1st/79th Foot were able to gain access to the rear of the hornwork. From there they opened a scattered fire on the French. The defenders suddenly stampeded, leaving the hornwork in the Allies' possession. The 1st Battalion of the 34th Line lost 138 killed and wounded, plus 60 men and seven guns were captured. Allied losses numbered 421 killed and wounded. =Burgos Castle= These re-enactors are dressed as British infantry. British engineers quickly began digging in batteries on the hornwork hill, the first battery was finished on 22 September but hoping to get lucky again, Wellington ordered an attack on the night of 22/23 September before his guns had fired a shot. Men of the 1st and 6th Divisions rushed forward against the palisades with axes, followed by men with just five ladders to scale the 24 foot wall, they failed to receive the support of other troops and were easily repelled with 150 of the 400 men killed and wounded. The engineers then began digging a mine 60 feet to get under the fort's west wall. When this was detonated in the early hours of the 29 September, part of the wall collapsed, the advanced party of British dashed forward but were not supported and were soon driven back from the defences. It turned out that the mine was run under an ancient buried wall that was in front of the modern wall. Consequently, the main French defenses were unscathed by the explosion. A frustrated Wellington ordered his engineers to dig a new mine. Meanwhile, he had his soldiers work overnight to erect a breaching battery close to the walls. At daybreak on 1 October, the French discovered this position and immediately zeroed in their defending artillery. They rapidly destroyed two of the three cannons and inflicted heavy losses on the gun crews. The following night the British reestablished the battery only to see it destroyed again in the morning. On 2 October, Wellington asked Popham to send two 24-pound cannons to replace his lost artillery. As it happened, these guns would not arrive in time. When the new mine was finally ready on 4 October, it was fired, blowing a 100-foot gap in the northwest wall and killing most of the defenders in that area. The subsequent attack managed to secure a foothold in the outer defenses after heavy fighting and 220 casualties.Gates (2002), p. 370 After the Allies began digging a new trench against the inner defenses, Dubreton launched a sortie without warning on 5 October. The attackers killed and wounded almost 150 Allies and carried off or spoiled much of their equipment. No sooner had Wellington resumed siege operations than Dubreton struck again. At 2am on the 8th, with perfect timing, the French swarmed out of the fort and inflicted 184 casualties while suffering small losses. Rain began to fall in sheets, flooding the siege trenches. The British guns on the hornwork ran so low on ammunition that French cannonballs were retrieved and reused. Wellington wrote, \\"This is altogether the most difficult job I ever had in hand with such trifling means. God send that they may give me a little more time.\\" A third mine was dug and on 18 October, at 4.30pm the mine was detonated under the Chapel of San Roman near the south wall. Assaults were mounted against the west and north walls, but support for the assaults was weak and as before, these attacks withered in the face of intense fire and 170 more casualties were added to the butcher's bill. With a French army threatening his position and with the problems arising from the shortage of artillery and ammunition, Wellington made preparations to retreat on 21 October. However, he was unable to withdraw all his siege guns. The engineers tried to demolish the captured hornwork, but their charges failed to explode. British losses in the siege amounted to 550 killed, 1,550 wounded, and three guns. The French lost 304 killed and 323 wounded, plus the 60 captured. =Operations= Marshal Nicolas Soult Soult raised the Siege of Cadiz on 25 August 1812 and abandoned a huge wagon train of booty in Seville on the 28th.Smith (1998), p. 389 By the end of September, Soult was in contact with Suchet and Joseph. On 15 October, Joseph's forces moved on Madrid with 61,000 soldiers and 84 guns. Soult's column was on the left while a second column under Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon marched to Soult's right.Glover (2001), p. 211 In the north, General of Division Joseph Souham's 41,000-man Army of Portugal was swollen to 53,000 by transferring 6,500 infantry and 2,300 cavalry from the Army of the North and by 3,400 reinforcements from France.Glover (2001), p. 213 To hold off these heavy concentrations, Wellington deployed 73,000 troops. At Burgos, he had 24,000 Anglo-Portuguese and Santocildes' 11,000 Spaniards. In the south Hill occupied Toledo with 20,000 soldiers while Major General Charles Alten held Madrid with 18,000. Angry that Wellington had been offered the supreme command in Spain, General Francisco Ballesteros refused to obey the British general's orders to obstruct Soult's move. High hopes had been placed on 8,000 Anglo- Sicilians under Lieutenant General Thomas Maitland at Alicante on the east coast. Maitland remained completely inert during this crisis. Wellington was north of Madrid at Burgos, dangerously separated from Hill's army. To make matters worse, the Tagus was not a serious military obstacle because of unexpectedly low water. When Wellington realized how badly he was outnumbered by Souham, he felt lucky to get away intact. He later wrote, \\"I had no reason to believe the enemy were so strong till I saw them. Fortunately, they did not attack me: if they had, I must have been destroyed.\\" Even so, he was loath to undertake a long retreat. Aftermath Stone bridge at Palencia Wellington raised the siege of Burgos on 21 October. He quietly slipped away, undetected by the French until late on 22 October. The drawn Battle of Venta del Pozo was fought on the 23rd. The bulk of the Allied army fell back behind the Pisuerga River at Torquemada that day.Glover (2001), p. 214 Between 25 and 29 October, Souham and Wellington fought a series of actions along the Pisuerga and Carri√≥n Rivers at Palencia, Villamuriel de Cerrato, and Tordesillas which are collectively called the Battle of Tordesillas. When the French seized the bridge over the Duero River at Tordesillas on the 29th, Wellington was compelled to order a retreat.Gates (2002), pp. 372-373 On 29 October, Hill received Wellington's positive order to abandon Madrid and march to join him. After a clash with Soult's advance guard at Perales de Taju√±a on the 30th, Hill broke contact and withdrew in the direction of Alba de Tormes.Gates (2002), pp. 373-374 Joseph re-entered his capital on 2 November. Anxious to destroy the British, Joseph rushed after them without bothering to leave a garrison in Madrid. The Allied retreat continued until Wellington and Hill joined forces on 8 November near Alba de Tormes.Glover (2001), p. 217 On 15 November, Soult's 80,000 Frenchmen faced Wellington's 65,000 Allies on the old Salamanca battlefield. To the disappointment of many French soldiers and generals, Soult declined to attack. Wellington began retiring west that afternoon.Glover (2001), p. 218 Logistical arrangements in Wellington's army collapsed and the Allied soldiers marched in cold pouring rain for four days with very little food.Glover (2001), p. 219 Soult only sent his cavalry after the Allies. Even so, the French horsemen scooped up hundreds of stragglers. On 16 November, 600 Allied soldiers were captured by the French. The number of prisoners was even higher on the 17th and included Wellington's second-in- command, General Edward Paget. Before reaching the friendly fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo, the Allied armies lost 5,000 men missing, mostly soldiers who had died from hunger or exposure in the chaotic retreat.Gates (2002), pp. 374-375 It appeared that all of Wellington's efforts in 1812 had been for nothing. Yet, his Anglo-Portuguese army had gained a moral ascendancy over the French that it would never relinquish.Glover (2001), p. 222 References =Notes= =Bibliography=   * Category:Battles of the Peninsular War Category:Battles in Castile and Le√≥n Category:Sieges of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Conflicts in 1812 Category:Sieges involving the United Kingdom Category:Sieges involving France Category:Sieges involving Spain Category:Sieges involving Portugal Category:1812 in Spain Category:King's German Legion Category:September 1812 events Category:October 1812 events Category:History of the province of Burgos ","title":"Siege of Burgos"},{"id":"14066072","text":"Harold Arnold \\"Harry\\" Parkes (September 1888 ‚Äì March 1947) was an English footballer and the manager of various football clubs in the 1920s and 1930s.

In Greek mythology, Aethilla or Aethylla (Ancient Greek: Œë·º¥Œ∏ŒπŒªŒªŒ± or Œë·º¥Œ∏œÖŒªŒªŒ±) was a daughter of Laomedon and sister of Priam, Astyoche, and Medesicaste.  Mythology  After the fall of Troy Aethilla became the prisoner of Protesilaus, who took her, together with other captives, with him on his voyage home. He landed in Thrace in order to take in fresh water. While Protesilaus had gone inland, Aethilla persuaded her fellow prisoners to set fire to the ships. As a result of this being done, the Greeks were forced to remain on the spot and founded the town of Scione.Conon, Narrations 13Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica s.v. According to other authors, the event took place in Italy; in commemoration of it, the nearby river received the name Nauaethus (\\"of the burning ships\\"), while Aethilla, Astyoche, and Medesicaste were surnamed the Nauprestidai (\\"they who set fire to ships\\").Tzetzes, on Lycophron 921 In some accounts, it was a Trojan captive woman named Setaia who convinced her fellow prisoners to set fire to the ships. Setaia was crucified by the Greeks for doing so, but a town and a rock located on the spot where this had happened (not far from Sybaris) were named after her.Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica s.v. Œ£Œ∑œÑŒ±·øñŒøŒΩTzetzes on Lycophron, 1075Etymologicum Magnum 711.39 In Virgil's Aeneid, during Aeneas' and his fellow Trojans' stay in Sicily, some of the women set fire to their ships in order to make Aeneas settle where they were staying at the moment rather than sail further; even though the fire is quickly put down, several ships have been destroyed so some of Aeneas' people have to remain in Sicily, where they found Acesta (Segesta).Virgil, Aeneid 5.604‚Äì771 This story is remarkably parallel to that of Aethilla and her fellow prisoners, but the characters are different: Virgil mentions Beroe, wife of a Doryclus, as the one who instigated the arson, and Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam, among those who supported her decision. According to Strabo, the Sicilian river Neaethus (a variant for \\"Nauaethus\\") was called that because when \\"certain of the Achaeans who had strayed from the Trojan fleet\\" landed near it and went inland to explore the country, the Trojan women who were sailing with them, both being tired of the long voyage and having observed the fertility of the land, set fire to the ships in order to make the men stay there.Strabo, Geographica 6.1.12 Thus, Strabo's account contains elements of all the versions given above.

DNA-PKcs belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase protein family. The DNA-Pkcs protein is a serine/threonine protein kinase comprising a single polypeptide chain of 4,128 amino acids.  Function  DNA-PKcs is the catalytic subunit of a nuclear DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase called DNA-PK. The second component is the autoimmune antigen Ku. On its own, DNA-PKcs is inactive and relies on Ku to direct it to DNA ends and trigger its kinase activity. DNA-PKcs is required for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair, which rejoins double-strand breaks. It is also required for V(D)J recombination, a process that utilizes NHEJ to promote immune system diversity. DNA-PKcs knockout mice have severe combined immunodeficiency due to their V(D)J recombination defect. Many proteins have been identified as substrates for the kinase activity of DNA-PK. Autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs appears to play a key role in NHEJ and is thought to induce a conformational change that allows end processing enzymes to access the ends of the double-strand break. DNA-PK also cooperates with ATR and ATM to phosphorylate proteins involved in the DNA damage checkpoint. Cancer DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer, and deficiencies in DNA repair genes likely underlie many forms of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage may increase mutations due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage may also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations may give rise to cancer. PRKDC (DNA-PKcs) mutations were found in 3 out of 10 of endometriosis- associated ovarian cancers, as well as in the field defects from which they arose. They were also found in 10% of breast and pancreatic cancers. Reductions in expression of DNA repair genes (usually caused by epigenetic alterations) are very common in cancers, and are ordinarily even more frequent than mutational defects in DNA repair genes in cancers. DNA-PKcs expression was reduced by 23% to 57% in six cancers as indicated in the table. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + Frequency of reduced expression of DNA-PKcs in sporadic cancers ! Cancer !!Frequency of reduction in cancer !!Ref. - !Breast cancer 57% - !Prostate cancer 51% - !Cervical carcinoma 32% - !Nasopharyngeal carcinoma 30% - !Epithelial ovarian cancer 29% - !Gastric cancer23% } It is not clear what causes reduced expression of DNA-PKcs in cancers. MicroRNA-101 targets DNA-PKcs via binding to the 3'- UTR of DNA-PKcs mRNA and efficiently reduces protein levels of DNA-PKcs. But miR-101 is more often decreased in cancers, rather than increased. HMGA2 protein could also have an effect on DNA-PKcs. HMGA2 delays the release of DNA-PKcs from sites of double-strand breaks, interfering with DNA repair by non-homologous end joining and causing chromosomal aberrations. The let-7a microRNA normally represses the HMGA2 gene. In normal adult tissues, almost no HMGA2 protein is present. In many cancers, let-7 microRNA is repressed. As an example, in breast cancers the promoter region controlling let-7a-3/let-7b microRNA is frequently repressed by hypermethylation. Epigenetic reduction or absence of let-7a microRNA allows high expression of the HMGA2 protein and this would lead to defective expression of DNA-PKcs. DNA-PKcs can be up- regulated by stressful conditions such as in Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. After ionizing radiation DNA-PKcs was increased in the surviving cells of oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues. The ATM protein is important in homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA double strand breaks. When cancer cells are deficient in ATM the cells are \\"addicted\\" to DNA-PKcs, important in the alternative DNA repair pathway for double-strand breaks, non- homologous end joining (NHEJ). That is, in ATM-mutant cells, an inhibitor of DNA-PKcs causes high levels of apoptotic cell death. In ATM mutant cells, additional loss of DNA-PKcs leaves the cells without either major pathway (HRR and NHEJ) for repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Elevated DNA-PKcs expression is found in a large fraction (40% to 90%) of some cancers (the remaining fraction of cancers often has reduced or absent expression of DNA-PKcs). The elevation of DNA-PKcs is thought to reflect the induction of a compensatory DNA repair capability, due to the genome instability in these cancers. (As indicated in the article Genome instability, such genome instability may be due to deficiencies in other DNA repair genes present in the cancers.) Elevated DNA-PKcs is thought to be \\"beneficial to the tumor cells\\", though it would be at the expense of the patient. As indicated in a table listing 12 types of cancer reported in 20 publications, the fraction of cancers with over-expression of DNA-PKcs is often associated with an advanced stage of the cancer and shorter survival time for the patient. However, the table also indicates that for some cancers, the fraction of cancers with reduced or absent DNA-PKcs is also associated with advanced stage and poor patient survival. Aging Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the principal DNA repair process used by mammalian somatic cells to cope with double-strand breaks that continually occur in the genome. DNA-PKcs is one of the key components of the NHEJ machinery. DNA-PKcs deficient mice have a shorter lifespan and show an earlier onset of numerous aging related pathologies than corresponding wild-type littermates. These findings suggest that failure to efficiently repair DNA double-strand breaks results in premature aging, consistent with the DNA damage theory of aging.

Its last assignment was with Tactical Training, Holloman, stationed at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. It was inactivated on 26 July 1991. Upon inactivation, all personnel, equipment and aircraft were transferred to the 479th Fighter Group. History : for additional history, see 479th Flying Training Group On 1 December 1952 the unit was established as the 479th Fighter-Bomber Wing at George AFB, California, replacing the Federalized Missouri Air National Guard's 131st Fighter-Bomber Wing, which had been brought to active duty during the Korean War. The 479th FBW inherited the F-51D Mustangs of the ANG unit as well as becoming the host wing of George AFB for almost the next 20 years. Its operational squadrons were the 434th, 435th, 436th, and the wing squadrons participated in numerous exercises, augmented air defenses of the West Coast, and deployed overseas to support both USAFE during periods of tension in Western Europe; to Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis and to PACAF during the Vietnam War. =F-100 Super Sabre era= F-100A-10-NA, AF Ser. No. 53-1562, of the 434th Fighter-Day Squadron. Initially, the new wing maintained tactical proficiency with the World War II‚Äìera F-51Ds inherited from the Air National Guard, then in February 1953 upgrading to the North American F-86H Sabre jet aircraft. The wing was chosen to be the first USAF wing to be equipped with the North American F-100A Super Sabre, receiving its first aircraft in November 1953. The 479th became operationally ready with the F-100A on 29 September 1954. However, the F-100A had been rushed into service with unseemly haste, often over the objections of Air Force flight crews who found the Super Sabre had serious problems that were not being adequately addressed. Disaster struck on 12 October 1954. On that day, veteran test pilot George Welch was carrying out a maximum performance test dive followed by a high-G pullout with the ninth production F-100A (52-5764) when his aircraft disintegrated in midair. Deficiencies were found with the design of the airplane and modifications were made. The F-100A's performance was considered good but there were still some major operational deficiencies which prevented the F-100A from being an acceptably- good day fighter. Consequently, the F-100A was never very popular with its flight crews. =F-104 Starfighter era= Lockheed F-104C-5-LO Starfighter, AF Ser. No. 57-0926, 479th Tactical Fighter Wing, circa 1960. F-104C Starfighter, AF Ser. No. 57-0914, 435th TFS photographed at George AFB, 1965Aircraft was deployed to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand in 1966 and assigned to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing. It crashed due to engine failure over Thailand 16 January 1967 F-104s of the 476 TFS on the Da Nang flightline ‚Äì 1965 With the F-100A considered to not meet the requirements of an effective air superiority fighter, its service life in the USAF phased out of active inventory, beginning in 1958. Beginning in October 1958, the 479th was re- equipped with a new aircraft: the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. The Starfighter was primarily intended for a nuclear strike, but Tactical Air Command wanted to use it to carry out ground attack missions with conventional weapons. However the range, endurance, all-weather capability, and offensive capability of the F-104 made it ill-suited to USAF ground attack needs. Out of a total of 722 Starfighters originally ordered for the USAF, only 296 were actually delivered, the remainder being canceled. However the modifications made to the F-104G led to a large number of foreign sales, with the Starfighter metamorphosing from a mediocre air-superiority day fighter into a highly capable multirole all-weather strike fighter. The excellent flying weather in Southern California gave the 479th a new mission to train F-104 pilots from West Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Italy during January 1962 ‚Äì August 1963 as a result of these foreign-sale success of the G-model Starfighter. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the 435th TFS deployed to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida to carry out air strikes against targets in Cuba in case an invasion proved to be necessary. Fortunately, the crisis was peacefully resolved. Following the crisis, Air Defense Command (ADC) organized a squadron of F-104As at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida to defend against possible intrusions by Cuban fighters. However, the F-104A was armed only with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles and ADC began retrofitting its F-104As with Vulcan cannons. During the first half of 1964, while these planes were being modified, the 479th deployed F-104Cs to Homestead to augment ADC's alert forces there.McMullen, Richard F. (1964) \\"The Fighter Interceptor Force 1962‚Äì1964\\" ADC Historical Study No. 27, Air Defense Command, Ent Air Force Base, CO (Confidential, declassified 22 March 2000), pp. 17, 23 The 479th was the only USAF wing to take the F-104C into combat when in April 1965, the 476th TFS deployed to Kung Kuan Air Base, Taiwan. From its base in Taiwan, the squadron began a regular rotation to Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam where its mission was to fly MiG combat air patrol (MiGCAP) missions to protect USAF F-100 fighter bombers against attack by North Vietnamese fighters. The effect of F-104 deployment upon NVN and PRC MiG operations was immediate and dramatic. NVN MiGs soon learned to avoid contact with USAF strikes being covered by the F-104s. During the entire deployment of the 476th only two fleeting encounters between F-104Cs and enemy fighters occurred. As the MiG threat abated, the 476th TFS was tasked with some weather reconnaissance and ground attack missions. A few of these were against targets in North Vietnam, but most of them were close air-support missions against targets in the South under forward air controller direction. The F-104s were fairly successful in this role, gaining a reputation for accuracy in their cannon fire and their bombing and capable of quite rapid reaction times in response to requests for air support. During this period, the 476th F-104s maintained an in-commission rate of 94.7%, a testimony both to the quality of 476th maintenance personnel and to the simplicity and maintainability of F-104 systems. However, an F-104 went down during a sortie 100 nm SSW of DaNang on 29 June. The pilot was rescued with minor injuries. The 436th TFS assumed the 476th's commitment in DaNang on 11 July, and the 436th began flying combat sorties the next day. Although a few MiGCAP missions were flown, the majority of the missions were quick-reaction close-air support missions in support of ground troops. On 23 July, Capt. Roy Blakely attempted to crash-land his battle-damaged F-104C at Chu Lai. Blakely successfully set his aircraft down gear-up, but died when his F-104 swerved off the runway into a sand dune. The 436th TFS had a bad day on 20 September 1965. F-104C pilot Major Philip E. Smith managed to get lost while flying an EC-121 escort mission over the Gulf of Tonkin. After several equipment failures and incorrect steering commands, he managed to wander over Hainan Island and was shot down by a pair of Chinese MiG-19s (J-6s). He ejected and was taken prisoner. While the rest of the squadron was out looking for Major Smith, two other F-104s had a midair collision while returning to their base. Both pilots ejected and were recovered unharmed. A week later, another F-104C was shot down by enemy AAA, and its pilot was killed. After these four losses, the remnants of the 436th were rotated back to George in November 1965. =F-4 Phantom II= McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II, AF Ser. No. 66-0382, 1970 In December 1965, the wing began transitioning to the F-4 Phantom II, and gained two new squadrons (68th, 431st), both equipped with the new F-4D model. The F-4D was an improved version of the F-4C, which had been deployed to South Vietnam the previous April. In February 1966, the wing began F-4 replacement pilot training and reassigned the 435th TFS with its F-104Cs to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The F-104 remained with the 434th and 436th squadrons until early 1967 when they also were replaced by F-4Ds and the Starfighters were reassigned to the 198th TFS of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. The F-104Cs replaced that unit's elderly F-86H Sabre fighter-bombers. The 435th was then rotated back to George AFB from Thailand and also re-equipped with Phantoms. During the Vietnam War, the 479th became the premier F-4 Fighter training wing of the USAF, and F-4D pilots appeared in Southeast Asia for the first time in May 1967. From the spring of 1967, the F-4D gradually began to replace the earlier F-4C in combat over the skies of Vietnam. The first F-4D MiG \\"kill\\" took place on 5 June 1967, when crewmen Maj. Everett T. Raspberry and Capt. Francis Gullick shot down a MiG-17 near Hanoi. Since the pilot and the WSO operated as a well-integrated team, both of them were credited with a kill when they scored one. Along with the USAF fighter pilot training, the 479th began training foreign personnel in F-4 operations and maintenance in March 1969, as they had done in the early 1960s with the F-104. Pilots were trained from Israel, Iran, Japan, and West Germany. In 1969 and 1970, F-4C and early model F-4E aircraft were used by the 4452d and 4535th Combat Crew Training Squadrons. With the American withdrawal from its South Vietnamese bases in 1971, the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned from Phan Rang Air Base to George AFB. Under a program where combat wings from the Vietnam War were retained in order to preserve and honor their combat heritage, the 479th was inactivated with the 35th absorbing the personnel, equipment and aircraft of the 479th on 1 October 1971. =Flying Training Wing= The 479th was reactivated as 479th Tactical Training Wing on 1 January 1977 at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, flying the Northrup A T-38 Talon. The 479th TTW's mission was to provide Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) training for pilots assigned to fly the spectrum of Air Force fighter and attack aircraft in all service components (active, guard and reserve).

When first introduced in the early 19th century, the objective of such a prison or \\"penitentiary\\" was that of penance by the prisoners through silent reflection upon their crimes and behavior, as much as that of prison security. More commonly however, the term \\"separate system\\" is used to refer to a specific type of prison architecture built to support such a system.  Early British prisons  Millbank Prison was a prison in Millbank, Westminster, London. It was originally constructed as the National Penitentiary and for part of its history served as a holding facility for convicted prisoners before they were transported to Australia. It was opened in 1816 and closed in 1890. Pentonville Prison in the Barnsbury area of North London had a central hall with five radiating wings, all visible to staff at the center. It opened in 1816 and had separate cells for 860 prisoners.  Eastern State Penitentiary: Basis for many 19th-century prisons  Eastern State Penitentiary in 1855. The first prison built in the United States according to the separate system was the Eastern State Penitentiary in 1829 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its design was later copied by more than 300 prisons worldwide. Its revolutionary system of incarceration, dubbed the \\"Pennsylvania System\\" or separate system, originated and encouraged separation of inmates from one another as a form of rehabilitation. Common features of a separate system prison include a central hall, with several (from four to eight) radiating wings of prison blocks, separated from the central hall and from each other by large metal bars. While all the prison blocks are visible to the prison staff positioned at the centre, individual cells cannot be seen unless the staff enter individual prison blocks. This is in contrast to the panopticon prisons. The spaces between the prison blocks and the prison wall are used as exercise yards. When the separate system was first introduced, prisoners were required to be in solitary confinement even during exercise; as a result panopticon-style structures were erected inside these yards, in which a guard post was surrounded by tiny, cell-like, one-person exercise \\"yards\\". By the end of the 19th century, these structures were removed in favour of more open‚Äîif communal‚Äîexercise yards. However, in certain prisons such as Pentonville, in London, even during communal exercise, prisoners were required to wear masks in silent isolation.http://www.victorianlondon.org/publications5/prisons-06.htm Many of these separate system prisons from the 19th century continue to house prisoners to this day; moreover, the separate system continues to influence modern prison architecture.  Other elements  The prison chapel in Lincoln Castle. Designers of these penal institutions drew heavily on monastic solitary confinement to both destroy the identity of the inmate (and thus make him easier to control) and to crush the \\"criminal subculture\\" that flourished in densely populated prisons. Prisoners incarcerated in separate system prisons were reduced to numbers, their names, faces, and past histories eliminated. The guards and warders charged with overseeing these prisoners knew neither their names nor their crimes, and were prohibited from speaking to them. Prisoners were hooded upon exiting a cell, and even wore felted shoes to muffle their footsteps. The result was a dumb obedience and a passive disorientation that shattered the \\"criminal community.\\" Hughes, Robert. The Fatal Shore. New York: Knopf, 1986. 518. The regime extended to the prison chapel, Lincoln Castle, which was used as a gaol in the early Victorian period, in which the prisoners could all see the chaplain, but not each other. It was also used in the prison chapel of Port Arthur, Tasmania, where many convicts were taken upon transport to Australia.  See also  Lockstep in the Auburn Prison.

This temperature change is known as the Joule-Thomson effect, and is exploited in the liquefaction of gases. Inversion temperature depends on the nature of the gas. For a van der Waals gas we can calculate the enthalpy H using statistical mechanics as :H = \\\\frac{5}{2} N k_\\\\mathrm B T + \\\\frac{N^2}{V} (b k_\\\\mathrm B T - 2a) where N is the number of molecules, V is volume, T is temperature (in the Kelvin scale), k_\\\\mathrm B is Boltzmann's constant, and a and b are constants depending on intermolecular forces and molecular volume, respectively. From this equation, we note that if we keep enthalpy constant and increase volume, temperature must change depending on the sign of b k_\\\\mathrm B T - 2a. Therefore, our inversion temperature is given where the sign flips at zero, or : T_\\\\text{inv} = \\\\frac{2a}{b k_\\\\mathrm B} = \\\\frac{27}{4} T_\\\\mathrm c , where T_\\\\mathrm c is the critical temperature of the substance. So for T > T_\\\\text{inv}, an expansion at constant enthalpy increases temperature as the work done by the repulsive interactions of the gas is dominant, and so the change in energy is negative. But for T < T_\\\\text{inv}, expansion causes temperature to decrease because the work of attractive intermolecular forces dominates, giving a positive change in energy.

Baker played in 136 Major League games and had a .207 batting average with 51 hits, 38 runs, 22 runs batted in, and 11 doubles. Baker was the younger brother of Dave Baker who also played in the Major Leagues. In high school, Doug Baker played for Granada Hills and one of his teammates was future Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-07-17-sp-13999-story.html Pro Career Baker was first selected by the Oakland Athletics in the ninth round of the 1981 MLB draft. He did not sign with Oakland, and then later transferred fro m Los Angeles Valley Community college to Arizona State. In the June Draft of 1982, Baker was selected again, this time in the ninth round by the Detroit Tigers. Baker signed with the Tigers and was assigned to their minor league team in the Southern league, the Birmingham Barons. Playing third base for Birmingham that season, Baker played in 70 games, batted .225 and drove in 21 runs. The next season was Baker's first full season in pro baseball. The Tigers made a change, relieving Ed Brinkman of his duties and named Roy Majtyka as manager. Majtyka moved Baker from third to short and Baker played in 120 games and lifted his batting average to .241. In July 1984, Baker made his MLB debut. He went hitless in three at bats against the Chicago White Sox.https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA198407020.shtml Baker spent most of the season as a back-up, playing third and second base as well as shortstop. Doug even got a taste of post season baseball in the big leagues, as he appeared in one game during the American league Championship, as a defensive replacement for Alan Trammell in Detroit's 8-1 win over the Kansas City Royals.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/KCA/KCA198410020.shtml It would be his only post season appearance as he did not play in the World Series. Over the course of the next few seasons, with Trammell and Lou Whitaker entrenched at Shortstop and Second base respectively, Baker bounced around from Triple-A to the majors. In February 1988, Baker was traded to the Minnesota Twins for journeyman minor leaguer Julius McDougal. Baker would appear in just three games for the Twins that season. After the season was over, he signed a contract with the Houston Astros but spent the entire season in the minors. At the age of thirty, and not thrilled about the prospect playing another season in the minors, Baker retired from baseball.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1993-07-17-sp-13999-story.html Not long after he won a ring with the Tigers, Baker's world series ring was stolen and a replacement was made. The original ring was later located and returned to Baker. Baker would later action off the original, which sold on eBay for $12,000. However, that wouldn't be the only ring Baker would earn in his baseball career. He'd also earn two more as a scout for the Chicago White Sox and Miami Marlins.http://www.greatest21days.com/2010/11/doug-baker-able-fill-in-570.html References External links Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Minnesota Twins players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Los Angeles Valley Monarchs baseball players Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Evansville Triplets players Category:Nashville Sounds players Category:Toledo Mud Hens players Category:Portland Beavers players Category:Tucson Toros players Category:People from Fullerton, California ","title":"Doug Baker (baseball)"},{"id":"14066307","text":"Tomasz Starzewski (born 13 August 1961) is a British fashion and interior designer.

The alliance formed as a response to the unpopularity of President Samper caused by the \\"8000 process scandal in which money from the Cali drug cartel entered the presidential campaign of Samper and in which Serpa was also involved as head of the campaign. The alliance united the official candidate for the Conservative party, Andres Pastrana and a fraction of the Colombian Liberal party led by Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento who had failed to win the party's nomination against Serpa. At last, they ended the Liberal Party 12-years ruled in Colombia. During the Presidency of Pastrana After the election, the coalition allowed more liberal politicians to join the Great Alliance for Progress, a move supported mainly by N√©stor Humberto Mart√≠nez and then senator Fabio Valencia Cossio for the conservative party, in a moment when former officialism liberals were trying to gain a seat in the presidency of Congress of Colombia and in its both chambers. Both chambers were won by the coalition as well as the 14 legislative commissions with some 60 senators and 90 chamber representatives. Surprisingly, and because of the coalition, Conservative senator Valencia-Cossio was elected by a liberal majority as President of the Senate of Colombia.El Colombiano The Great Coalition for Change began to crumble with the election for Controller General Carlos Ossa Escobar who was mainly supported by the Colombian Liberal party. Senators that first supported the coalition decided to distance themselves from the Pastrana government, like √çngrid Betancourt, Claudia Blum, Fuad Char, Salom√≥n N√°der and Javier Ram√≠rez. They alleged that Pastrana had not been following the political accords pact during the presidential campaign, adding to the criticism that these senators made against ministers of the Pastrana administration. After this incident the coalition in congress reduced from 60 to 40 senators and 90 to 60 chamber representatives, causing the political reform of the Pastrana government to fail a pass in Congress which in turn returned to their parties of militancy. The majority in congress, both houses and commissions, then turned its control to the Liberal Caucus, causing tensions between congress and the Pastrana administration. As another factor to the failure of the coalition was the peace negotiation with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP) guerrilla during the first three years of government. Pastrana faced a lot of criticism for giving the FARC guerrilla a large demilitarized area in El Caguan without almost any concessions in favor of the government or Colombians. The guerrilla, in contrast, used the area to strengthen militarily as a base for their illegal drug trade expansion and to gain international support.

King Cacoma calls on the player(s) to save the princess and the kingdom. Gameplay Cacoma Knight is a hybrid of Qix and anime elements. Each level is a single screen. The first image that the player sees is a landscape, for example, a forest or a town. The image will then fade into a \\"corrupt\\" version of the landscape, for example, the trees become rotten and buildings become ruined. Each screen has a \\"Qualify\\" target that shows how much of the screen must be cleared before the game continues to the next level. The player can then use the Magical Chalk to section off an area of the landscape, using either the borders of existing cleared sections or the borders of the screen. When a full shape is completed with no holes in its borders, the smaller of the two sections created is \\"purified\\" and returned to the original state shown at the beginning of the level. In the cleared section, there may be power-ups or items that increase the point score of the player.

Some enemies can only move along the borders of the screen and the chalk lines that the player creates, others have free rein of the screen within given borders. Enemies can be destroyed by trapping them within an area of chalk, however, they will repopulate quickly thereafter. The player must avoid getting hit by enemies. If the player allows the character to get hit by the enemies too many times (based on the difficulty), they will be brought to a continue screen. Continuing costs one Credit, of which the player has a predetermined amount based on the difficulty that they are playing on. If the player runs out of the Credits, the game ends. A visual measure of progress is implemented between rounds in the game (a round includes several landscapes that the player must complete). When a player completes a round, an incomplete image is shown which is slowly filled in as the player completes more and more rounds.

The founding date of the organization differentiates depending on opinion, but it is clear the league began around 1908 and thrived for 10-20 years. The organization is also most commonly referred to as the National League for Opposing Women's Suffrage. Gardener, Park and Catt at Suffrage House in Washington It is important to know how the term was created. \\"The word ‚Äúfranchise‚Äù is derived from the Anglo-French word meaning 'liberty.'\\" The French term \\"Francis\\" refers to gifting power and rights to a peasant or serf. Those with an English background know the term to be defined as \\"empowering those who have no rights \\". In April of 1909, pamplets were published in efforts to oppose votes for women. These pamplets were created by group of men who paid one to five cents to become a member of the organization. The league gathered as many signatures as possible and published them throughout the 1900's. The organization was orginally called the Women's National Anti- Suffrage League but after running out of funding they were bought out by the Men's League for Opposing Women's Suffrage. The uniting of two groups created the new name, National League for Opposing Women's Suffrage. The main objective of the National League for Opposing Women's Suffrage was \\" to resist the proposal to admit women to parliamentary Franchise, and to Parliament, whilst at the same time maintaining the principle of the representation of women on Municipal and other bodies concerned with the domestic and social affairs of the community.\\" Small article on reason to vote YES. The Suffrage Movement was deeply attacked through these pamplets. Women were described as not suitable for politics due to their sensitive nature. Men believed their work deserved a higher price because it was worth more. The articles also discussed how Parliamentary franchise for a women would cause grave danger to the Empire and womanhood. White female suffrage was introduced into South Australia in 1894, followed by Western Australia in 1899, New South Wales in 1902 and Queensland in 1905. Victoria did not admit women to the voting polls until 1909. Local residents responded to the formation of the Anti-Franchise League by establishing the Harcourt Branch of the Women's Franchise League - the Castlemaine branch had been established in 1895. They were referred to as the Women's Suffrage Movement. The fight for women's rights to vote finally was successful through laws in the 1900s. However, all white Australian women gained the right to vote in Federal elections in 1902. In 1903, Vida Goldstein became first woman in British Empire to stand for election to a national parliament. She was unsuccessful in the Australian elections of December that year.

His name, recorded by the contemporaneous historian Ammianus Marcellinus (XXVII 12. 16), is evidently a Latinized rendition of Varaz-Bakur or Varaz-Bakar of the later, early medieval, Georgian chronicles. According to Ammianus, Aspacures was made king of Iberia by the Sassanid King Shapur II after the overthrow of his nephew Sauromaces. His being described as \\"an impious man and a hater of the faith\\" by the Georgian chronicler Leonti Mroveli is significant in this regard: the term implied at that time Zoroastrianism religious sympathies; and connote also his pro-Iranian political orientation.

It was also released as Fraulein. Plot In Cologne near the end of World War II, American prisoner of war Foster MacLain (Mel Ferrer) escapes and is sheltered by Professor Julius Angermann (Ivan Triesault). Angermann's daughter Erika (Dana Wynter) is not so welcoming, but hides the American from the soldiers looking for him. MacLain leaves when it is safe. Not long afterwards, a bomb strikes the house, killing the professor. Erika goes to live in Berlin with her cousin Karl (Herbert Berghof). Karl has lodgers, Fritz and Berta Graubach (Luis van Rooten and Blandine Ebinger), who are outspoken supporters of the Nazi cause. When the Russians capture the city, Erika hides in the attic for fear of being raped. However, Berta betrays Erika's existence in order to save herself, and a drunken corporal starts up the stairs. Karl is killed trying to stop him. The Russian chases Erika out on the roof, but slips and falls to his death, and Erika is charged with his murder. Colonel Dmitri Brikett (Theodore Bikel) is attracted to her and saves her life, though he expects a sexual reward. However, Erika manages to flee to the American-controlled sector of the city with the assistance of Lori (Dolores Michaels), a nightclub piano player. There, she runs into the Graubachs, who now claim they always opposed the Nazis. The Graubachs insist she come stay with them. She finds out later that they are running a brothel and want to employ her. She flees, but not before they have already registered her as a prostitute with the American authorities. They pursue her, but a kindly military policeman, Corporal Hanks (James Edwards), blocks them. Meanwhile, MacLain searches for his wartime benefactors, finally finding Erika working in a nightclub. When he offers to help her, she asks him to find her fianc√© Hugo (Helmut Dantine). MacLain uses his connections to locate Hugo and takes Erika to see him. However, she finds a very changed, embittered man ‚Äì a crippled war veteran, who is living in a makeshift shelter with another woman, and who is not happy to see her with an American. Hugo asks Erica for the engagement ring back so he can buy an artificial arm to replace the one he lost in the war. She gives it to him and leaves. As MacLain spends time with Erika, he falls in love with her. He asks her to marry him and move to the United States. She accepts, but when she goes to apply for a passport, she realizes that she will be turned down because of her registration as a whore. She is about to give up, but by chance, Corporal Hanks is the man processing the applications. Remembering the circumstances of their previous meeting, he erases her \\"occupation\\" and gives her the papers she needs. Cast * Dana Wynter as Erika Angermann * Mel Ferrer as Maj.

Weiler, critic for The New York Times, described the film as \\"a curiously episodic adventure whose parts are far more interesting than the whole drama.\\" Of the stars, he wrote that \\"Miss Wynter is an appealing, if somewhat docile, heroine\\", while \\"the quality of docility is more than marked in Mr. Ferrer\\", who is \\"on occasion, restrained to the point of apathy.\\" Differences between the film and the novel The character of Maj. Foster MacLain does not appear in the novel. While the film opens in Cologne, the novel begins in Dresden, and an early scene depicts the fire-bombing of the city by British and American planes in February 1945. The uncle with whom Erika takes refuge in Berlin is called Albert Heringsdorf in the novel. Apolitical in the film, he is a Communist in the novel, and welcomes the Soviet invasion. The depiction of what German women suffered during the taking of Berlin by Russian troops is more realistic in the novel; Erika is raped by Captain Dmitri, the Russian officer who appears in the film as her protector. The counterpart of the film's Lori, as Erika's friend, is a lesbian with anti- American opinions. Cpl. Hanks, the African-American soldier Erika encounters in the film, is a much more important character in the novel. He is called Si Hicks, and he and Erika fall in love and enjoy many months of happiness. Not understanding the racial situation in America, Erika begs Si to take her to his home, which leads to tragic consequences for Si. Erika does eventually marry an American, the successful businessman Foster Middendorf. He takes her back to New York, but they become bored with their comfortable existence, and he accepts an important diplomatic position in Berlin. When he and Erika return, she has a final encounter with Irmfried von Diesborn, the aristocratic German officer she was engaged to during the war. She recoils from his vision of a militarized Germany rising again.  References  * Fr√§ulein by James McGovern. New York: Crown. 1956.

It is not very familiar or much discussed book till now. In this drama, a good description can be found about the negative attitudes shown by the then existing 19th century educated Bengali Babu class of people towards the prostitutes and the prostitution. From the first half of the 19th century, centering on Sonagachhi, a huge organised prostitution area surrounding Cornwallis Street on the east, and Chitpur on the west were formed. Although many areas in Calcutta were inhabited by those prostitutes outside those areas also. On the south it was Kalighat to Khidirpur dock areas, in the middle-Calcutta it was Kalinga- Fenwick Bazar, on the far south in Kareya area many girls from different social-classes of Hindu-Muslim-Christian communities were engaged with this profession. More than that, there was no clear 'mark' or 'boundary-line' between the 'gentleman areas' and the 'prostitutes areas'. Many areas had scattered or mixed up population of those two kinds. Rather, many areas could be termed as 'half-gentleman' areas, where normal gentleman's families and various types of prostitutes co-existed side by side. From the middle of the 19th century, the British colonial administration, Christian Missionaries, and native English-knowing educated 'Victorian' Indian gentlemen started campaign against prostitutes. This was their part of the project of social 'sanitation' process for creating the so-called 'gentle-society'. Under the leadership of Mr. Kaliprasanna Singha, the 'Vidyotsahini Sabha' ( ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßã‡ßé‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßÄ ‡¶∏‡¶≠‡¶æ ) submitted one mass-petition in the Indian Legislative Council.

The adjacent Tiretta Bazar area is mainly a loadingunloading point with offices or godowns of a large number of transport companies. The area is very unsanitary. =Garia= There is a small red-light district in Garia. There were plans to build a home for retired sex workers in the area. =Kalighat= In south Kolkata, there is a red light district in the neighbourhood of Kalighat. Located around the banks of the Adi Ganga canal, an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 prostitutes live and work there. Kolkata has emerged as a hub for the trafficking of girls, who often arrive from Nepal, Bangladesh and Burma. From Kolkata they are often sold again to brothels in Mumbai (Bombay) or Chennai (Madras). Some will go on to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Many of the women in Sonnagachi were forcedly taken away from their homes; some were tricked and others sold into prostitution by their friends and families; most of them are illiterate.Prostitutes Calcutta Sex Slaves.

The area came to be known as Sona Gachi from a Sufi saint Sona Ghazi whose tomb (mazaar) is located in the locality. It is an area with several hundred multi-storey brothels, and around 10,000 sex workers.Girl-trafficking hampers Aids fight BBC news. 30 November 2004 Sonagachi is located in North-Kolkata near the intersection of Chittaranjan Avenue Sova Bazar and Beadon Street, just north of the Marble Palace. Previously there were many Bengali prostitutes in Sonagachi. But now-a-days Rajasthani and Khamia-Nepalese prostitutes have gained in number. According to class-division, the red-light areas of Kolkata are also divided into four different classes: poor-class, lower-class, middle- class, and rich-class. For example, The red-light area which once existed opposite to the diagonal angle of Khanna Cinema Hall was of 'poor-class'. When they contacted customers, they asked them \\"Khat-e na Chot-e\\" ? Which means, \\"Do you want to sleep in wooden cot or on jute-sheet spread over the floor?\\" As customers wished, the fee varied according to their choice. The lower-class and middle-class of prostitute areas were scattered around Haarkaata Gully and near Chetla/Kalighat bridge. The areas near Elliot Road could not be exactly referred as a 'prostitute area'. Mainly Anglo-Indian citizens lived there. Prostitutes who also lived there in different houses, they used to do their business in Kothhas or Kuthhis (small empty rooms for prostitution purpose only) scattered over the area. The Bengali customers generally never visited those Kuthhis. In Sonagachhi, few houses can be seen marked with the lines, \\"‡¶á‡¶π‡¶æ ‡¶≠‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶°‡¶º‡ßÄ\\" which means, \\"This is a gentleman's house\\". People who are not involved in any way with prostitution business and do other good jobs, and lived in their family-owned houses for many years, but who have not been able to move out of the area due to financial or other reasons, they have marked their houses as such so that they are not disturbed by customers or any other persons in any way. There are some difference between the character of Sonagachhi and Soho of London or Pigul of France. The character of race courses and red light areas of different cities of the world are almost same. But the character of Sonagachhi is a little bit different. Prostitution in Kolkata is illegal like many other big cities of the world. Though it is flourishing right in front of the nose of the administration. Several non- government organizations and government organizations operate here for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) including AIDS. Sonagachi project is a prostitute's cooperative that operates in the area and empowers sex workers to insist on condom use; a relatively low percentage of prostitutes in this district (5.17% of the 13,000 prostitutes in Sonagachi) are estimated to be HIV positive.In Sonagachi, keeping HIV away a daily battle.

People of this area earns their lives by farming. A higher secondary school, village office, Gramin Bank, and telephone cxchange are the main government establishments. When India was under British power,Kachery of British Police was situated near by area. This Kachery was burnt by freedom fighters in freedom struggle movement. This place is now known as Kachery kunnu. Art forms Theyyam or Thira is main traditional art form. Theyyam is performed in connection with the Festival of Temples. Vechilott Thalachillon temple is very famous in Thira festival. Every year on Meenam 18,19[Malayalam era]the Temple festival is celebrated here. Vechilott is an ancient nair tharavadu. This nair family conducts the celebration with the help of people in and around. Balikkala Balikkala is a ritualistic art form Kozhikode District, especially in Koyilandy Taluk. So many Balikkala artists had lived in Kokkallur area once. As the name indicates, it is related with fertility, or rather it is a sorcery for protecting pregnancy. It was performed long ago when the people were not much aware of modern medicine. This traditional art form was performed mainly either for caring the pregnancy period or to drive out evil from a possessed girl. It takes place at the residence of Piniyal (the possessed). Before the Balikkala is started the main performer, who is also a Sorcerer will make an artificial Kavu (a divine garden) with five type of herbs in the courtyard. Then a kalam (a floor decorated with figures of deities) is created by him and his assistants with five coloured herbal powders. The possessed girl is seated in the left side of kalam and the singers, especially female singers begin to work accompanying by musical instruments such as arippara and chenda. The five embodiments such as Gandharvan, Bhairavan, Kuttichathan, Chamundi and Bhadrakali are eulogised in the song. This performance will start in the evening and will continue till the next day early in the morning. When the song is at its climax the possessed lady will be in a frenzy and her body trembles. She becomes unconscious and the song and music is stopped then. Now these rituals are instincts. The remaining members of the community says that they had performed the last Balikkala 35 years ago. *Kana eythu Kana eythu is a primitive form of archery, which was an enjoyment for the hundreds of people at Festival seasons. People of this area, especially of Chavittan para would celebrate Onam Festival only with a few special games at that time, since the electronic media or even News paper was very rare at that time. The people would divide into two groups namely vadakkar (Northern) and Thekkar (Southern) for the competition. Then they with arrows made of coconut leaves and bows made of bamboo panels make the war. They would shoot at the target placed about 100 metres far away from them. The size of object placed would change as small sizes, gradually while the game was improving. When an arrow hit on the object the shooter could run after and would accept a handful of arrows as a gift. Meanwhile, if another one hit arrow on the object, just the same time the former hit, the later would be the recipient of gift. Moreover, his gang would make fun of others. At last the winners were selected by weighing the arrows they shot. Chavittanpara is one among a few places where this ancient game is still remaining. Now Krishna Memorial Arts and sports club is the promoter of this game.

Mihrdat is unknown to Ammianus who continues to refer to him as Aspacures (Amm. 27.12; 30.2). Around 370, the Iranian intervention in Iberia drew a Roman response, and Ammianus reports an expedition sent by Emperor Valens to restore Sauromaces to the throne of Iberia. When the Roman legions reached the river Cyrus, their commander Terentius and Sauromaces forged a deal with Aspacures to divide the kingdom in two along the river. Aspacures indicated that he had considered defecting to Rome, but feared for the life of his son Vitra, who was by then a hostage at the Sassanid court.Lenski, Noel Emmanuel (2002), Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p. 175.

They are mostly transported in a protein capsule, and the density of the lipids and type of protein determines the fate of the particle and its influence on metabolism. The concentration of blood lipids depends on intake and excretion from the intestine, and uptake and secretion from cells. Blood lipids are mainly fatty acids and cholesterol. Hyperlipidemia is the presence of elevated or abnormal levels of lipids and/or lipoproteins in the blood, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fatty acids =Intestine intake= Short- and medium chain fatty acids are absorbed directly into the blood via intestine capillaries and travel through the portal vein. Long-chain fatty acids, on the other hand, are too large to be directly released into the tiny intestine capillaries. Instead they are coated with cholesterol and protein (protein coat of lipoproteins) into a compound called a chylomicron. The chylomicron enters a lymphatic capillary and enters into the bloodstream first at the left subclavian vein (having bypassed the liver). In any case, the concentration of blood fatty acids increase temporarily after a meal. =Cell uptake= After a meal, when the blood concentration of fatty acids rises, there is an increase in uptake of fatty acids in different cells of the body, mainly liver cells, adipocytes and muscle cells. This uptake is stimulated by insulin from the pancreas. As a result, the blood concentration of fatty acid stabilizes again after a meal. =Cell secretion= After a meal, some of the fatty acids taken up by the liver is converted into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and again secreted into the blood.Molecular cell biology. Lodish, Harvey F. 5. ed. : - New York : W. H. Freeman and Co., 2003. Page 321. b ill. In addition, when a long time has passed since the last meal, the concentration of fatty acids in the blood decreases, which triggers adipocytes to release stored fatty acids into the blood as free fatty acids, in order to supply e.g. muscle cells with energy. In any case, also the fatty acids secreted from cells are anew taken up by other cells in the body, until entering fatty acid metabolism. Cholesterol The fate of cholesterol in the blood is highly determined by its constitution of lipoproteins, where some types favour transport towards body tissues and others towards the liver for excretion into the intestines. The 1987 report of National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panels suggest the total blood cholesterol level should be: <200 mg/dl normal blood cholesterol, 200‚Äì239 mg/dl borderline-high, >240 mg/dl high cholesterol. The average amount of blood cholesterol varies with age, typically rising gradually until one is about 60 years old. There appear to be seasonal variations in cholesterol levels in humans, more, on average, in winter. These seasonal variations seem to be inversely linked to vitamin C intake. =Intestine intake= In lipid digestion, cholesterol is packed into Chylomicrons in the small intestine, which are delivered to the Portal vein and Lymph. The chylomicrons are ultimately taken up by liver hepatocytes via interaction between apolipoproteinE and the LDL receptor or Lipoprotein receptor-related proteins. =In lipoproteins= Cholesterol is minimally soluble in water; it cannot dissolve and travel in the water-based bloodstream. Instead, it is transported in the bloodstream by lipoproteins that are water-soluble and carry cholesterol and triglycerides internally. The apolipoproteins forming the surface of the given lipoprotein particle determine from what cells cholesterol will be removed and to where it will be supplied. The largest lipoproteins, which primarily transport fats from the intestinal mucosa to the liver, are called chylomicrons. They carry mostly fats in the form of triglycerides. In the liver, chylomicron particles release triglycerides and some cholesterol. The liver converts unburned food metabolites into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and secretes them into plasma where they are converted to intermediate density lipoproteins(IDL), which thereafter are converted to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and non-esterified fatty acids, which can affect other body cells. In healthy individuals, the relatively few LDL particles are large. In contrast, large numbers of small dense LDL (sdLDL) particles are strongly associated with the presence of atheromatous disease within the arteries. For this reason, LDL is referred to as \\"bad cholesterol\\". High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles transport cholesterol back to the liver for excretion, but vary considerably in their effectiveness for doing this. Having large numbers of large HDL particles correlates with better health outcomes, and hence it is commonly called \\"good cholesterol\\". In contrast, having small amounts of large HDL particles is independently associated with atheromatous disease progression within the arteries. =Intestine excretion= After being transported to the liver by HDL, cholesterol is delivered to the intestines via bile production. However, 92-97% is reabsorbed in the intestines and recycled via enterohepatic circulation. =Cell uptake= Cholesterol circulates in the blood in low- density lipoproteins and these are taken into the cell by LDL receptor- mediated endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits, and then hydrolysed in lysosomes. =Cell secretion= In response to low blood cholesterol, different cells of the body, mainly in the liver and intestines, start to synthesize cholesterol from acetyl-CoA by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. This is then released into the blood. Related medical conditions =Hyperlipidemia= Hyperlipidemia is the presence of elevated or abnormal levels of lipids and/or lipoproteins in the blood. Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are extremely common in the general population, and are regarded as a highly modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In addition, some forms may predispose to acute pancreatitis. One of the most clinically relevant lipid substances is cholesterol, especially on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood is called hypercholesterolemia. Hyperlipoproteinemia is elevated levels of lipoproteins. =Hypercholesterolemia= Hypercholesterolemia is the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. It is not a disease but a metabolic derangement that can be secondary to many diseases and can contribute to many forms of disease, most notably cardiovascular disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare genetic disorder that can occur in families, where sufferers cannot properly metabolise cholesterol. =Hypocholesterolemia= Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed hypocholesterolemia. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, and while some studies suggest a link with depression, cancer and cerebral hemorrhage it is unclear whether the low cholesterol levels are a cause for these conditions or an epiphenomenon .

History On 20 March 1968, four months before the formation of Calicut University, employees of the Kerala University Centres held a meeting at Malabar Christian College and formed the \\"Calicut University Centre of non-teaching Staff Union\\". Later, on 10 February 1970, this organization became the Calicut University Employees Union. Struggles Listed below are a few of the struggles in the history of the Union. *The move to fill higher posts by deputation denying eligible promotion to the existing staff of the University was prevented by the Union in 1970. The strike by the Union which started in January, 1971 demanding service and wage parity as per the Kerala University pattern and creation of new posts ended successfully. *The State Employees and teachers who began striking on 30 January 1970 demanding implementation of DA at central rates also witnessed participation of Calicut University Staff en bloc. The Union also functioned as a member organization of the Kozhikode-based workers co-ordination council during this period. *The resistance struggle started by the Union on 22 December 1972 questioning the unjustified suspension of Smt. Anjelina George, an employee of the Commerce Department is an important chapter in its history. Declaring prohibitory order, University authorities and State Government let loose Police Raj in the campus. The strike went on for 17 days and the State Government amended KSR adding Article 58 (A) to implement dies non. Later in January, 1973, the Achutha Menon Ministry used this rule to suppress the strike of the employees for pay revision. *The novel agitation 'Kutil Kettal' (making hut), resolved to by the Union in February, 1982, to draw attention to the problem of residential accommodation resulted in the construction of working men's and working women's hostels. *Struggle for the creation of new posts after proper assessment of the workload of the employees also came to a successful end. When these norms these were violated in 1992, the union put up strong resistance and agitation. *The historic struggle against the formation of Pre Degree Board in 1986 which went on for 54 days is a glittering chapter in the history of struggles of University Employees in Kerala. This agitation built up by the Confederation of University Organizations through relentless campaign drew its energy and implication mainly from Calicut University Employees Union. The historic movement which developed into a mass agitation paved the way for the downfall of the then UDF Government and swearing in of the LDF Ministry. *The black decree promulgated by the Antony Government in 2002 torpedoing major rights and benefits acquired by the working class of the Kerala through selfless struggles and strikes for many years led to great resistance in which the Union had an incomparable role. Recently the union made continuous campaign demanding the ouster of Vice-Chancellor M. Abdul Salam and dismissal of the nominated Syndicate in the wake of the revelations of attempts to offer land to private agencies.

History of song festivals In 1869 Johann Voldemar Jannsen established the Estonian Song Festival while the nation was still a province of the Russian Empire. This festival was considered responsible for fostering an Estonian national awakening. After that, the new tradition was born and the festivals are still held every five years. Lauluv√§ljak ‚Äì The Tallinn Song Festival Grounds The old stage designed by Karl Burman in 1928. XXV Estonian Song Festival The first stage on its current location between Narva Road and Pirita Road in Kadriorg, was built in 1928 for the 9th Estonian Song Festival. It was designed by Karl Burman and provided space for 15,000 performers. During the Occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union, there was a need for a larger stage. The new and current arched stage was built in 1959 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Estonian SSR in the upcoming year. It was designed by architect Henno Sepmann together with Alar Kotli and Endel Paalmann. The 15th Estonian Song Festival in 1960 was celebrated on the new stage. The stage was meant to hold over 15,000 singers but the reverse also became possible, with the performance taking place in front of the stage and audience sitting on the stage. On the northern side of the song stage is the 42m high fire tower, which is used during the Estonian Song Festivals. It is open for the public all year long. In 1988, Estonians gathered at the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds, to sing patriotic hymns in what became known as the Singing Revolution that led to the overthrow of Soviet rule. Also in 1988, three years before the collapse of the Soviet Union and Estonia's reestablishment of independence, an international rock concert called the Summer of Rock (also referred to as Glasnost Rock) took place on the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds between August 26 and 28. Headlining acts included Public Image Ltd (PiL), Big Country and Steve Hackett. The concert attracted over 130,000 attendees. Rock Summer would continue each summer until 1997.Estonian World: Rock Summer 25 brings a sense of nostalgia to Tallinn View from the stage Today, Tallinn's Song Festival Grounds are also used for hosting international acts, such as Iron Maiden, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, 50 Cent, Metallica, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, Andrea Bocelli, Madonna, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Lady Gaga, Green Day, Jos√© Carreras, Robbie Williams and the contemporary dance music event, the Sundance Festival. In August 2009, Madonna performed in front of a sold-out crowd of 72,067. In June 2006, Metallica gave a concert for more than 78,000 fans. In August 1997, Michael Jackson performed in front of an 85,000 head crowd. Song Festival Grounds panorama An optimal capacity for concerts is 75,000 fans.

He worked for an elite clientele and was a regular collaborator of leading Antwerp painters such as Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens.Katlijne Van der Stighelen and Arnout Balis. \\"Vos, de (i).\\"] Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 9 January 2017 Life De Vos was born in Hulst near Antwerp, now in the Dutch province of Zeeland. Little is known of his childhood. His father moved with his family to Antwerp in 1596.Vivien Gaston, A Powerful Appearance of Life: Cornelis de Vos‚Äôs Mother and child Cats fighting in a larder In 1604 Paul de Vos became a pupil of the obscure painter Denijs van Hove in Antwerp. In 1605 he continued his studies under the little- known painter David Remeeus (1559‚Äì1626) with whom his older brother Cornelis also trained. He later also trained with the equally obscure Eduard Snayers. De Vos became a master and joined the guild of St. Luke at a late age in 1620, probably because he had initially trained and worked in the workshop of his brother-in-law Frans Snyders who had married his sister Margaretha in 1611.Paul de Vos at the Netherlands Institute for Art HistoryPeter C. Sutton, Northern European Paintings in the Philadelphia Museum of Art: From the Sixteenth and the Nineteenth Century, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1 January 2000, pp. 346‚Äì349 Paul de Vos married Isabella Waerbeek, a notary's daughter, on 15 Nov 1624 and the couple had 10 children. Peter Paul Rubens was the godfather of one of their sons named Peter Paul born in 1628. The de Vos family prospered and were able to make important investments in real estate in Antwerp. Triumphant Cupid among Emblems of Art and War, with Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert De Vos enjoyed the patronage of influential aristocrats in Spain such as the marquis the Leganes, head of the Council of Flanders in Madrid and Philippe-Charles, 3rd Count of Arenberg, then residing in Madrid. From the latter he obtained a commission to paint at least 36 paintings of birds, hunts and fables between 1633 and 1640.Paul de Vos (Hulst 1591/5-1678 Antwerp), Three dogs playing, with songbirds on the floor at Christie's In 1637-1638 he worked on the decorations for the Spanish royal residences, Buen Retiro and Torre de la Parada. Most of the decorations at the Torre de la Parada involving animal scenes without humans were by his hand. The governor of the Governor of the Spanish Netherlands Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand visited his workshop. He had two pupils: Alex Daemps in 1627 and Lancelot van Daelen in 1636. Work De Vos was a prolific artist who produced a large body of work in the categories of large paintings on canvas, drawings and oil sketches. He often signed his paintings but never dated them which makes it difficult to establish a precise chronology. His subject matter was varied and included scenes of pantries, quarrelling dogs, bird concerts and animal fights. He specialized in monumental animal scenes, especially hunts for aristocratic patrons, that are heavily influenced by Frans Snyders. In the past, a lot of his works have been misattributed to Snyders. Garden of Eden, with Jan Wildens De Vos was able to develop his own personal style that accentuated abrupt movement, the gruesome aspects of hunts, used warmer colours and a broader brush stroke than Snyders. He also expanded the iconographic tradition with scenes of fighting cats and horses attacked by wolves. As was common amongst artists in 17th-century Antwerp, De Vos frequently collaborated with other painters. He collaborated with Rubens, Anthony van Dyck (Rest on the Flight into Egypt, Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg), Erasmus Quellinus II, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Adriaen van Utrecht and Jan Wildens. De Vos would typically contribute the animals or still-life elements to the compositions of these painters or would ask landscape specialists such as Jan Wildens to add landscapes to his creations. Still life with servant There are various collaborations recorded with Jan Wildens, who was Paul de Vos' brother-in-law since Paul's brother Cornelis had married Wildens' half-sister Susanna Cock on 27 May 1617.Matthias Depoorter, Cornelis de Vos at barokinvlaanderen Example of collaborations with Jan Wildens are the compositions Paradise (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) and Garden of Eden (Auctioned at Sotheby's on 28 January 2016 in New York, lot 30), which resemble the paradise paintings created by Jan Brueghel the Elder. Bull subdued by dogs His collaborations with Rubens consisted mainly of hunting scenes. He was an important contributor on the series of hunting scenes designed by Rubens in the period 1636-1638 for the hunting pavilion Torre de la Parada of the Spanish king Philip IV near Madrid. Many of these are now in the Prado museum.Svetlana Alpers, 'The decoration of the Torre de la Parada', Phaidon, 1971, p. 144 One art historian has compared Paul de Vos' contributions to Rubens' hunting scenes with those of Paul Snyders' and found de Vos to be less accurate in the animal anatomy and less accomplished in the psychological expression of the animals. Other art historians regard the hunting scenes of de Vos as more dynamic and evidencing a more personal style when compared with those of Snyders, who was more a still life painter. In their collaboration with Rubens, Snyders and de Vos often worked from sketches made by Rubens while in other cases they were given the freedom to develop their own ideas. The expressive style and motifs of Rubens' animal paintings had an important influence on both Snyders and de Vos.Arnout Balis, Rubens hunting scenes, Part 18, Harvey Miller, 5 Mar 1987, pp. 70‚Äì87 De Vos introduced new motifs into the iconographic tradition in his scenes of fighting cats and horses attacked by wolves.

The plans for an airport at Agua Dulce began in 1958. Aircraft modification engineer Robert W. Lillibridge and Northrop test pilot Errol Williams purchased the vacant acreage for the airport. The costs of subsequent improvements were financed by millionaire businessman Jim Annin. A special permit to begin building was required. On October 27, 1959, special permit case No. 1404-(5) was granted by the Regional Planning Commission of Los Angeles County. In the 1990s, local residents fought an attempt by Los Angeles County to buy the airpark and convert it to a regional airport.

The colony would have been located south of the Ohio River, primarily in what are now West Virginia and northeastern Kentucky. Vandalia was never approved by the British Crown and had no colonial government, although some Virginians and Pennsylvanians had already settled there. After the American Revolutionary War, the Vandalia settlers sought unsuccessfully to be admitted as a state called Westsylvania. However, they had no legal title to the land and were opposed by the governments of Virginia and Pennsylvania, which both claimed the area as their own under colonial charters. Ultimately the federal government split the area between Pennsylvania and Virginia according to the Mason‚ÄìDixon line.Cranmer, History of the Upper Ohio, 1:59‚Äì63 Kentucky was later settled as a territory and admitted as a state; West Virginia was admitted as a state during the American Civil War.

In the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768), the British required the Iroquois to give the \\"suffering traders\\" a grant of land. Those who benefited the most were Samuel Wharton and William Trent. Known as the \\"Indiana Grant\\", this land was located along the Ohio River and included part of the Iroquois' hunting ground, which they had controlled since the 17th century.Marshall, \\"Lord Hillsborough, Samuel Wharton, and the Ohio Grant, 1769- 1775\\" English Historical Review (1965), 80:717-18 When Wharton and Trent sailed to England in 1769 seeking to have their grant confirmed, they joined forces with the Ohio Company to form the Grand Ohio Company, also called the Walpole Company.

It is licensed to Pittsburg, Kansas, and owned by Pittsburg State University. Studios are located in Shirk Hall on the PSU campus, while the transmitter is located two miles south of Weir, Kansas. The station airs classical music, as well as news and talk programming from NPR, Public Radio International, American Public Media and the BBC World Service. It is one of the few NPR stations to be the primary member for two markets‚ÄîPittsburg and Joplin, Missouri (though they are a single television market). KRPS is the smallest full NPR member in Kansas. KRPS operates a translator at 102.7 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, which is in the Tulsa market. This is mainly because the main NPR member in Tulsa, KWGS, has a weak signal in the Bartlesville area. History Before KRPS signed on, the only source of NPR programming in the area was a translator of KSMU in Joplin. In 1977, just after Pittsburg State gained university status, the Department of Speech and Theater proposed to build a 10-watt station, but it was rejected by the Kansas Board of Regents due to a U.S. Federal Communications Commission freeze on new 10-watt applications. Later in 1977, Pittsburg State and the University of Kansas proposed to jointly operate a public radio station, but that proposal died due to a failure to meet Corporation for Public Broadcasting requirements for public funding. When Donald W. Wilson became president in 1983, he launched a concerted effort to build a public radio station for one of the few areas of the country without public radio. In 1984, when KU announced plans to build a network of repeaters for its NPR station, KANU, the initial plan called for repeaters in Pittsburg and Joplin. Wilson supported this plan, but it collapsed for want of funding. Wilson then renewed efforts for Pittsburg State to support a station of its own. After a two-year fundraising effort, Pittsburg State decided to buy KJWR, a small 380-watt educational station in Weir and operated by the Weir Public Broadcasting Foundation since 1984. The license was transferred on September 4, 1987 and the call letters changed to KRPS. It would have been KPSU, but those calls were already in use by the student radio station at Oklahoma Panhandle State University. The station was set to go on the air on April 29, 1988. However, it looked like that goal would not be met after rain moved into the area in early April. After KU loaned an antenna, KRPS signed on for the first time at 4 pm on April 29. KRPS began streaming live on the Internet in mid-2018. It was one of the few full NPR members not to offer live streaming.

His father, Sir Richard Bourke, was brother of Sir William Bourke, 1st Baron of Castleconnell, and his mother was Honor, daughter of Conor O'Mulryan, Chief of Owney. Before marrying Bourke, Honor had been married to De Lacy of Bruff, and was the mother of that famous soldier of the Desmond Rebellions, Sir Piers de Lacy. Sir John was married to Grace, the daughter of George Thornton, who received some of the confiscated Desmond property in County Limerick. He therefore, kept aloof during the Desmond Rebellions, but during Sir George Carew's victorious march through Limerick after he had taken the Castle of Lough Gur, he was called upon to submit to Queen Elizabeth. He replied stating he considered \\"it was sinful and damnable personally to submit to Her Majestie\\", and Sir George Carew thereupon laid waste his lands. On submission he was reproved for his \\"rebellious obstinacies\\", but through the good offices of Sir George Thornton, was pardoned and restored to his estate. He did not feel happy under the \\"protection\\" of the Queen and applied for leave to travel to Spain on a \\"pilgrimage to St. Iago\\", but this was refused him and he was compelled to remain with his family at Brittas. Religious persecution When the religious persecutions which followed the suppression of the Fitzgeralds began, Bourke incurred the enmity of the government by his open avowal of the Catholic Faith and by his protection of the persecuted and hunted clergy. During the short lull in the persecutions he openly attended Divine Service at St. Mary's Cathedral, temporarily restored to the Catholics, and was received together with his family and retainers, into the Dominican Confraternity of the Holy Rosary. On the renewal of the persecutions, Sir John was summoned to answer a charge of recusancy and was put into prison. Again the good offices of Sir George Thornton obtained his release, but although restored to his estates and fortune, he continued to harbour the hunted priests and was acknowledged \\"protector of the Catholics\\". Arrest In October 1607, while Mass was being celebrated in Brittas Castle, he was betrayed by his kinsmen, Theobald Bourke of Castleconnell and Sir Edmond Walsh of Abington. A detachment of horse soldiers arrived to arrest the priests and on Sir John's refusing to give them up or open the castle to the soldiers he was outlawed and Brittas Castle besieged. Sir John \\"with his casque on his head, his shield on his left arm and his sword in his right hand, burst out and made good his escape\\". He arrived at Waterford on his way to Spain, but was here betrayed, arrested and sent back to Limerick for trial. He refused to renounce the Catholic Faith or to conform to the new state religion, stating \\"he could acknowledge no king or queen against the King of Heaven and Queen of Heaven...whoever would act otherwise was not a servant of God but a slave of the devil\\", and was sentenced to be hanged, beheaded, and quartered. Execution He was hung on Gallows Green, 20 December 1607, but owing to his influence and popularity the latter part of the sentence was remitted. His body was returned to his relatives and buried in St. John's Churchyard, where no trace of it now remains. Legacy Sir John left nine children behind him, but his estates were confiscated and granted to Theobald Bourke, his betrayer, who was created 1st Baron of Brittas in 1618. The statue of \\"Our Lady of Limerick\\" given in reparation by a descendant of the Sharsfield who condemned Bourke to death. He is the grandfather of John Bourke, Mayor of Limerick, who was the great-grandfather of Edmund Burke.

It serves the Pittsburg area. The station is currently owned by Wayne Gilmore and Greg Chalker through licensee Parsons Media Group, LLC. History KLKC signed on October 26, 1948. It was owned by a group of local residents organized as the Community Broadcasting Company and broadcast with 250 watts during daytime hours only. The Sun Publishing Company acquired a majority stake in the station in 1950, with Carol B. Combs acquiring a majority stake in 1954. Combs moved the station from its initial home in the Faye Hotel to new quarters in the First National Bank building. In June 1978, the Federal Communications Commission awarded a construction permit for KLKC to build a companion FM station, utilizing the existing studios and AM transmitter site, and to begin as a simulcast of the daytime AM outlet. KLKC-FM 93.5 began broadcasting on October 6 of that year. Also in 1978, Carol Combs retired from the station at the age of 85; she continued to own it until her death in 1996 at the age of 103. The station remained at the First National Bank building for 35 years. However, in 1986, storm damage prompted the FM station to be unable to telecast in stereo. In 1989, KLKC built new studios and offices at the transmitter site, restoring FM stereo capability. The two stations continued to broadcast an adult contemporary format, with the FM simulcasting 80 percent of the AM's programming. After not being sold in nearly 50 years, KLKC went through two sales in a three-year span. In 2004, Acme Broadcasting bought the AM and FM outlets for $250,000. A year later, the Southeast Kansas Independent Living Resource Center, which owned KSEK-AM-FM in the Pittsburg area, acquired KLKC- AM-FM for nearly $335,000. In 2015, the Southeast Kansas Independent Living Resource Center sold its Pittsburg and Parsons stations to different owners. Parsons Media Group, owned by Wayne Gilmore and former station employee Greg Chalker, acquired the KLKC stations for $30,000; the seller also received five 30-second commercial ads per day on the stations for a period of two years. By that time, the 1540 AM frequency was airing a classic country format known as \\"Katy Country\\". The buyers executed a time brokerage agreement to immediately begin programming both stations. On January 1, 2016, KLKC changed its format from classic country to sports, with programming from Fox Sports Radio. Local and national sports had long been a part of KLKC's programming; current FCC chairman Ajit Pai has recalled listening to the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series and to high school basketball games on KLKC AM, and he has frequently mentioned KLKC in advocating for revitalization of the AM band. Translator In November 2018, KLKC AM began broadcasting over translator K294DE (106.7 FM), which is located on its AM transmitter tower; the translator signed on just after KLKC's 70th anniversary. Programming KLKC airs national Fox Sports Radio programming as well as play-by-play of the Kansas City Royals and Kansas Jayhawks and Labette County High School sporting events. It also airs some non-sports programs, including \\"Doctor on Call\\" and \\"Cardinal Corner\\".

The harvesting of wine grapes (Vintage) is one of the most crucial steps in the process of wine-making. The time of harvest is determined primarily by the ripeness of the grape as measured by sugar, acid and tannin levels with winemakers basing their decision to pick based on the style of wine they wish to produce. The weather can also shape the timetable of harvesting with the threat of heat, rain, hail, and frost which can damage the grapes and bring about various vine diseases. In addition to determining the time of the harvest, winemakers and vineyard owners must also determine whether to use hand pickers or mechanical harvesters. The harvest season typically falls between August & October in the Northern Hemisphere and February & April in the Southern Hemisphere. With various climate conditions, grape varieties, and wine styles the harvesting of grapes could happen in every month of the calendar year somewhere in the world. In the New World it is often referred to as the crush.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 338-339 Oxford University Press 2006 Feet Crushing Grapes To Make Wine Harvest season The majority of the world's wine producing regions lie between the temperate latitudes of 30¬∞ and 50¬∞ in both hemispheres with regions lying closer to the equator typically harvesting earlier due to their warmer climates. In the Northern Hemisphere, vineyards in Cyprus begin harvesting as early as July. In California some sparkling wine grapes are harvested in late July to early August at a slightly unripe point to help maintain acidity in the wine. The majority of Northern Hemisphere harvesting occurs in late August to early October with some late harvest wine grapes being harvested throughout the autumn. In Germany, Austria, the United States and Canada, ice wine grapes can be harvested as late as January. In the Southern Hemisphere harvest can begin as early as January 1 in some of the warmer climate sites in New South Wales, Australia. The majority of Southern Hemisphere harvesting occurs between the months of February and April with some cool climate sites like Central Otago, New Zealand picking late harvest wine grapes in June. Recent climate changes (particularly global warming) have shifted the harvest season in some countries ; future weather patterns may exceed a climatic threshold in some vineyards where it will be more difficult to maintain the current wine quality, however they could also push some regions into more optimal climatic regimes for the production of equilibred grapes. Change of wine grapes harvesting dates in France since 19th century Ripeness Clusters of ripe and unripe Pinot noir grapes. Throughout the history of wine, winemakers would use the sugar and acid levels of the grape as a guide in determining ripeness. Early winemakers tasted the grapes to gauge ripeness. Modern winemakers use a refractometer to measure high sugar levels and ¬∞Brix or titration tests (using an indicator such as phenolphthalein) to determine the titratable acidity within the grape. In recent times there has been more of an emphasis on the \\"physiological\\" ripeness of the grape, usually in the form of tannins and other phenolics.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 75 Abbeville Press 2003 Currently, tasting is the only way to measure tannin ripeness, which can take experience and skill to do accurately. Viticulturalists have not yet fully explained the complex processes that go into the ripening of tannins but most believe it begins with the polymerization of small astringent tannins into larger molecules which are perceived by the taste buds as being softer.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 10-11 Workman Publishing 2001 Mechanical harvesting Concord grapes The question of using mechanical harvesting versus traditional hand picking is a source of contention in the wine industry. Mechanical harvesting of grapes has been one of the major changes in many vineyards in the last third of a century. First introduced commercially in the 1960s, it has been adopted in different wine regions for various economic, labor and winemaking reasons. In Australia, the reduced work force in the wine industry has made the use of mechanized labor almost a necessity. A mechanical grape harvester works by beating the vine with rubber sticks to get the vine to drop its fruit onto a conveyor belt that brings the fruit to a holding bin. As technology improves mechanical harvesters have become more sophisticated in distinguishing grape clusters from mud, leaves and other particles. Despite the improvement many harvesters still have difficulties in distinguishing between ripe, healthy grapes and unripe or rotted bunches which must then be sorted out at the winemaking facility. Another disadvantage is the potential of damaging the grape skins which can cause maceration and coloring of the juice that is undesirable in the production of white and sparkling wine. The broken skins also bring the risk of oxidation and a loss of some of the aromatic qualities in the wine.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 22 Dorling Kindersley 2005 One of the benefits of mechanical harvesting is the relatively low cost. A harvester is able to run 24 hours a day and pick 80‚Äì200 tons of grapes, compared to the 1‚Äì2 tons that an experienced human picker could harvest. In hot climates, where picking quickly or in the cool of night is a priority, mechanical harvesting can accomplish these goals very well.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 28 Workman Publishing 2001 Hand picking Gr√ºner Veltliner grapes being hand harvested at Hahndorf Hill vineyard in the Adelaide Hills in Australia. Despite the costs, some wineries prefer the use of human workers to hand-pick grapes. The main advantage is the knowledge and discernment of the worker to pick only healthy bunches and the gentler handling of the grapes. The production of some dessert wine like Sauternes and Trockenbeerenauslese require that individual berries are picked from the botrytized bunches which can only be done by hand. In areas of steep terrain, like in the Mosel, it would be virtually impossible to run a mechanical harvester through the vineyard. In many wine regions, migrant workers are a sizable composition of the harvest time work force as well as local student and itinerant workers. Karen Ross, president of the California Association of Winegrowers, has estimated that as of 2007 as many as 70% of the employees in the California wine industry may be immigrants from Mexico.D.

Early life Robow was born on 10 October 1969 in Hudur, in the Bakool region southern Somalia. He studied at a local Qur'anic school, and later continued his religious education in the mosques of Mogadishu as well as those of his home region. A member of the Rahaweyn and more specifically of the Leysan clan which is particularly well represented in the South West State of Somalia. Robow also studied Islamic law in the 1990s at the University of Khartoum in Sudan. Al-Shabaab Robow and other leading Al-Shabaab members challenged the leadership of Ahmed Abdi Godane (Moktar Ali Zubeyr) at Barawe in June 2013. Godane killed two of the leading members, and Robow fled to his home district. Godane's forces launched an offensive against Robow's supporters, it was reported in August 2013. On 23 June 2017, United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) removed him Reward for Justice (RFJ) list following discussions was made with the Somali government after a US$5 million bounty was placed on him for information leading to his location on 7 June 2012. Defection On 13 August 2017, he surrendered to the Somali Government authorities. In a press conference held in Mogadishu shortly after, he denounced Al-Shabaab and called on its members to quit the group. Candidacy for Regional Presidency A year later, Robow was pushing the envelope again. The charismatic former Shabaab leader officially declared he was running for regional elections originally set for 17 November and later postponed to 19 December. Mukhtar Robow, also known as Abu Mansour, made the announcement to hundreds of his supporters in a welcoming rally in the South Western town of Baidoa. The enthusiasm, however, was not shared by the internationally backed Somali federal government in Mogadishu. In a sharp rebuke, Somalia's internal security ministry released a statement that Mukhtar Robow was not eligible to run for the regional elections. The problem, though, is that Somalia does not have a formal constitution and, legally, the powers of the federal and state government have not been adequately detailed. It was unclear whether the federal authorities have the ability to enforce a ban on a regional presidential candidate. Al Shabaab too has denounced the political ambitions of the group's highest profile defector. Ironically, the federal authorities and al Shabaab find themselves on the same side of the Robow candidacy controversy. Worried about Robow's popularity, the federal government has sent at least one high-level official to try to persuade him to step aside. The electoral commission, dismissing Mogadishu's demands, has awarded a certificate of eligibility to Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur. Mukhtar Robow was officially cleared by the South West State Electoral Commission to contest in the December elections despite early protest by the Federal government seeking to have him barred. The Coalition for Change, which has thrown its weight behind Mukhtar Robow, issued a statement after the polls were postponed. The group said it fears the government is planning to rig because the new date is not favourable for international observers as most of them will then have left Somalia for the end of the year festivities. Some 150 elite Somali forces, armed with DShK rifles, were deployed to Baidoa to physically block Robow from accessing the election venue. On 7 Nov 2018 The United Nations Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) warned of presidential election in Somalia's South West State have the potential to lead to violence and called on all parties to ensure that the electoral process proceeds in accordance with the established rules and avoids any behaviour which may lead to conflict or undermine the integrity of the electoral process. =Arrest= On 13 December 2018, Mukhtar Robow was arrested by African Union peacekeepers from Ethiopia and flown to Mogadishu under tight security. At least 12 people were killed in Baidoa in violence that erupted following Robow's arrest. Among those killed was a member of the regional parliament. The victims were shot by AMISOM Ethiopian forces and Somali Special Forces flown from Mogadishu. Somali lawmakers have written a protest letter to the AU Commission in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian government and the UN complaining about the conduct of AMISOM. His arrest also prompted the resignation of Somalia's Public Works Minister Abdifatah Mohamed Gesey, who hails from Baidoa and is from the same Leysan sub-clan as Robow, to resign in protest. The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Somalia, Nicholas Haysom wrote to the Somali government on 30 December 2018, requesting details of the legal basis of the arrest of Robow, as well as calling for investigations into the deaths in the protests following his detention. Somalia's security forces used lethal force to put down three days of demonstrations in the south-western town of Baidoa on 13‚Äì15 December, with at least 15 people killed and 300 people arrested, according to the UN. On 1 January 2019, three people were wounded including two UN staff members when a barrage of mortars were fired into the main UN base in Mogadishu. Somalia's government has ordered the UN top envoy to leave the country, accusing him of \\"deliberately interfering with the country's sovereignty.\\" The order comes days after the official, Nicholas Haysom, raised concerns at the action of Somalia's UN-backed security services in recent violence that left several people dead. The U.N. Security Council is expressing regret at Somalia's decision to expel a U.N. envoy who questioned the arrest of an extremist group defector-turned-political candidate.

He made a total of 405 appearances in the Football League for West Bromwich Albion, Southampton, Crystal Palace, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Plymouth Argyle, Bristol City and Colcester United. He then moved into non-league football becoming player- manager at Bath City and later became a youth trainer with England and briefly manager at Bristol City. He also made appearances for Los Angeles Wolves as a guest. Playing career =Early days= Burnside was born in Kingswood, near Bristol and attended Kingswood School and represented Bristol & District Schools, before joining Bristol City as a trainee in July 1955. His father was so keen to see David develop his football skills that he installed floodlights in his back garden to enable his son to practice in the evenings. =West Bromwich Albion= His potential was quickly spotted by First Division West Bromwich Albion to whom he moved in December 1955, signing professional papers in February 1957. He soon acquired nationwide fame for his incredible ball- juggling abilities when, in October 1957, during the half-time in a televised friendly match against Russian team CDSA Moscow he performed his tricks to entertain the crowd. In 1960, he entered a heading competition organised by the Sunday Dispatch newspaper. He managed 495 clean headers without a break and although this was far from a record it amply demonstrated his ball skills. During his time at The Hawthorns, West Bromwich were relatively successful, generally ending the season in the upper half of the First Division table, including reaching fourth spot in 1959‚Äì60. Burnside made 135 appearances for West Bromwich and represented England at Youth level as well as winning two under-23 caps. =Southampton= In September 1962, Ted Bates signed him for Second Division Southampton for a fee of ¬£18,000, making him Bates's third signing in 10 days (along with George Kirby and Stuart Williams). Burnside immediately became a fixture in the Saints side, alongside Terry Paine and John Sydenham on the wings and Kirby and George O'Brien in attack. He was adept at finding space with well-timed runs, and his passing skills were terrific. In the 1962‚Äì63 season Saints fielded the same line-up in 28 matches including all seven FA Cup matches as Saints progressed to the semi-final, going out 1‚Äì0 at Villa Park to eventual winners Manchester United, after an epic three match battle to get past Nottingham Forest in the previous round. In the first quarter-final replay against Forest, Burnside scored an 89th- minute equaliser as Saints came back from a three-goal deficit. In the second replay, at White Hart Lane he scored twice, including a rocket shot for the third goal as Saints finally defeated Forest 5‚Äì0. The cup run was not matched in the league, however, as Saints finished the 1962‚Äì63 season in eleventh place, although Burnside was the second highest scorer (behind O'Brien) with 14 goals. Despite a 6‚Äì1 victory over Charlton Athletic in the opening game of the 1963‚Äì64 season, Saints had dropped to the lower half of the table by mid- September. In the second victory of the season (2‚Äì0 over Newcastle United on 18 September) Burnside injured his knee and was out until mid-January, losing his place to John McGuigan. Although Burnside returned for a run of six games from mid-January to mid-February, including scoring in the 7‚Äì2 victory over Scunthorpe United on 29 January 1964, he was forced to sit out the remainder of the season, until the postponed final game of the season at home to Rotherham United in which he returned to score in a 6‚Äì1 victory (thereby helping Saints notch up 100 league goals for the season), with Saints finishing in fifth place. The following season, Burnside regained his place until he was surprisingly sold to Crystal Palace in December 1964 for ¬£12,000. The proceeds went to partly fund the purchase of Jimmy Melia, who was to lead the Saints to the First Division a year and a half later. In his two years at The Dell Burnside made a total of 70 appearances, scoring 26 goals. =Crystal Palace and Wolves= Burnside signed for Crystal Palace, then in their first season after promotion to Division Two, on 24 December 1964. He spent one and a half seasons with Palace in Division Two, (58 appearances, 8 goals) before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers on 7 September 1966, helping them to promotion to Division One (as runners-up) at the end of the 1966‚Äì67 season. He remained with Wolves until March 1968, when he moved back to Division Two with Plymouth Argyle. Whilst at Wolverhampton Wanderers, Burnside also made appearances, as a guest, for Los Angeles Wolves, essentially the Wolverhampton club, playing in the short-lived United Soccer Association league. =Plymouth Argyle= In March 1968, a fee of ¬£7,000 took the experienced 28-year-old to Home Park as one of new manager Billy Bingham's first purchases for the Pilgrims. Neither Bingham nor Burnside, who made his debut in a 2‚Äì0 Second Division win at Hull City, arrived in time to save Argyle from relegation to the Third Division at the end of the 1967‚Äì68 season. Burnside played in the last 12 games of the campaign. The following term, however, saw Burnside prove his worth as a player. After excelling as both inside-forward and deep-lying centre-forward, he was voted \\"Player of the Year\\" by Home Park fans in the 1968‚Äì69 campaign, in which he scored nine goals in 42 Third Division games. With Ellis Stuttard replacing Bingham in the manager's office, Burnside was used more sparingly in the 1969‚Äì70 season (15 League games, one goal) but he was a regular once more in 1970‚Äì71, mostly as a midfielder. He managed five goals in his 36 Third Division appearances. Burnside was an important member of the Argyle squad as the Pilgrims drifted along in the middle of the Third Division, but it is probable that he would have been even more effective if he did not have to cope with a daily commute from his Bristol home. Burnside's last senior game for the Pilgrims was in May 1971 at Millmoor, where he scored in a 1‚Äì1 Third Division draw with Rotherham United. The following season, he found himself stuck in the reserves, however, and in December 1971 he was transferred to his home-town club Bristol City. His final Argyle tally was 105 League games and 15 goals. Later career Burnside played just one League game for the Ashton Gate club, though, before going to Colchester United, his last League club in March 1972. In May 1972, he moved back to his home in Bristol and became player-manager of Southern League side Bath City, where he stayed until the following summer. There followed spells at various clubs including coaching at Walsall and playing/coaching with Minehead, Bridgwater Town and Taunton Town. In October 1979, he started working for the Football Association as a regional coach in the West country, before becoming part of the international set-up in 1983, having known England manager Bobby Robson since his time at The Hawthorns. He worked as the England Youth manager until January 1997 when he rejoined Bristol City as Director of Youth Football. In January 2000, he took on the role of caretaker manager after the departure of Tony Pulis, jointly with Tony Fawthrop. In their short time as caretaker managers, Fawthrop and Burnside guided the Robins to a Wembley appearance in the Football League Trophy Final, losing 2‚Äì1 to Stoke City. After handing the manager's post to Leroy Rosenior in summer 2000, Burnside continued to assist Bristol City as technical advisor, before a spell working with Bobby Gould as football co- ordinator at Cheltenham Town, which ended in October 2003. Burnside died on 17 October 2009 after suffering a heart attack aged 69. Shortly before his death, he had been adopted to contest a Bristol seat for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in the 2010 general election.

He is the son of Ggulu and the brother of Nambi. His name is translated from Lugandan as \\"disease\\" or \\"death\\" and he is responsible for death on Earth according to Gandan mythology.  The Legend  Location of UgandaIn The Legend of Kintu, Kintu (the first man) is eventually met by Nambi, the daughter of the heavenly deity Ggulu (also known as Mugulu). Upon learning of Kintu's existence, Ggulu orders his sons to steal Kintu's cow. Nambi is enraged by this and decides to bring Kintu to heaven. Kintu is then given many trials from Ggulu. After Kintu passes all of Ggulu's tests, Ggulu gives him his daughter among other gifts to take back to Earth. He gives them multiple vegetable plants, a hen, and some millet. He warns them then to hurry back to Earth to avoid gaining the attention of Nambi's brother Warumbe (also known as Walumbe) who he had sent away on an errand to prevent him from meeting Kintu. He specifically tells them not to come back for anything, but along the journey to earth Kintu and Nambi realize that they forgot to bring the millet. After much quarreling, one of them returns for the millet. While in heaven, Warumbe confronts Kintu and demands to accompany him to earth. After much deliberation, Kintu and Nambi allow Warumbe to accompany them to Earth. In accordance with Gandan culture, Warumbe, as a brother of the bride, claimed one of Kintu's children as his own. Kintu refuses Warumbe's claims and continues to do so throughout the years. Frustrated, Warumbe then begins to kill a single child every day. After conversing with Ggulu, Kaikuzi is sent to aid Kintu in sending Warumbe back to heaven. After refusing to accompany Kaikuzi back to heaven, Warumbe retreats by hiding in craters in the ground that he creates by stomping his foot. This is said to have created the 240 Walumbe Tanda Pits that are still in Uganda today. Kaikuzi soon tires of pursuing Warumbe and asks all of mankind to be silent for two days to lure Warumbe out. When Warumbe finally emerges, Kintu's children cry out at the sight of him and he again retreats into the earth. Upon Kintu's dismissal, Kaikuzi then returns to Ggulu and explains the situation. Upon hearing of this, Ggulu allows Warumbe to remain on Earth. Warumbe is therefore blamed as the reason for death on Earth. Though every descendant of Kintu is eventually claimed by Warumbe, Kintu continues to fight Warumbe by constantly having more descendants than Warumbe can steal. This legend is acted out in Kyazze Tekizzikayo, a musical film directed and composed by Kaz Kasozi in 2007.  Mpobe meets Warumbe  The constant battle between Warumbe and Kintu's descendants is especially apparent in another Gandan story where a hunter named Mpobe accidentally meets Warumbe. While following his hunting dog through a large hole in the ground, Mpobe stumbles upon a village and eventually is met by Warumbe. After informing Mpobe about his identity, Warumbe allows him to return after making him promise not to tell anyone about what he's seen. Mpobe graciously accepts this deal, but later discloses the details of this accidental encounter to his mother. Warumbe learns of this and comes to claim Mpobe's life. Mpobe pleads a deal to first consume all of his possessions before dying, which Warumbe accepts. Mpobe attempts to cheat death by prolonging this process over many years; however, his life is inevitably claimed by Warumbe.

The genre has seen commercial success for employing a more accessible sound at times compared to other forms of extreme music. Many notable melodic metalcore bands have been influenced by At the Gates and In Flames. History =Origins= Unearth performing in 2016. Melodic metalcore began to take form in the late 1990s and early-2000s, tracing its roots to Swedish melodic death metal groups such as At the Gates and In Flames. The stylistic origins of melodic metalcore and traditional metalcore differ greatly. Traditional metalcore evolved out of the hardcore punk scene in the late 1980s, when hardcore bands began to experiment with metal elements such as thrash metal guitar riffs and vocals. In contrast, melodic metalcore most often stemmed from American based metal bands who began incorporating metalcore elements, such as metallic breakdowns, into their music. Florida's Poison the Well are considered the first melodic metalcore band, proving extremely influential to subsequent bands thanks to their first two albums The Opposite of December and Tear from the Red. Massachusetts' Killswitch Engage are also considered to be a pioneering force in the genre, along with artists such as 7 Angels 7 Plagues, Chimaira, Dead to Fall, Heaven Shall Burn and Unearth Of these bands, frequently cited influences include In Flames, Slayer, At the Gates and Pantera. Belgian groups also played a large part in the development of the genre in its early years, as bands such as Arkangel began embracing the sounds of melodic death metal in their traditional metalcore sound, as early as 1998. =Commercial success= Darkest Hour. Killswitch Engage released their sophomore album Alive or Just Breathing in 2002, which has been noted as a significant influence on many bands to follow, such as Jinjer, August Burns Red and Miss May I. By 2004 the genre saw increasing prominence, with Shadows Fall's The War Within debuting at number 20 on the Billboard album chart. Trivium released their sophomore album, Ascendancy, in 2005, which peaked at 75 on the UK Albums Chart, made the band one of the more prominent bands in the scene at that point, despite changing their style away from melodic metalcore on many occasions. Killswitch Engage's 2006 effort As Daylight Dies was described by Brandon Tadday of Overdrive Magazine as \\"without a doubt one of the most impactful releases for melodic metalcore during the mid-2000s\\", peaking at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and spending 22 weeks in the charts. In 2008 the All That Remains' single \\"Two Weeks\\" peaked at number 9 at the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the U.S., and on the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 38. In 2007, the song \\"Nothing Left\\" by As I Lay Dying was nominated for a Grammy award in the \\"Best Metal Performance\\" category. An Ocean Between Us (the album that included \\"Nothing Left\\") itself was a commercial success, debuting at number 8 on the Billboard 200. Welsh melodic metalcore band Bullet for My Valentine's third album Fever debuted at number 3 selling more than 71,000 copies in its first week in the U.S. and more than 21,000 copies in the UK during 2010 alone. Australian melodic metalcore band Parkway Drive's third album Deep Blue reached number three on the Billboard Rock Charts in 2010, along with Miss May I's album Rise of the Lion having reached number 6 in 2014. Melodic metalcore band Bury Tomorrow's fifth studio album Black Flame reached number eleven on the Billboard albums chart in less than a week. Characteristics Melodic metalcore band All That Remains performing at the Ozzfest in 2006. Melodic metalcore bands often take influence from the guitar riffs and writing styles of Swedish melodic death metal bands, especially At the Gates, In Flames, Arch Enemy and Soilwork. Practitioners of the genre tend to make use of instrumental melody, and many prominently feature clean singing alongside typical death metal growls and screams. Melodic metalcore often promotes \\"very positive lyrical content.\\" The genre can also feature harmonic guitar riffs, tremolo picking, double bass drums and metalcore-stylized breakdowns. Some bands include guitar solos.\\"Taste of Chaos\\", Revolver, June 2008, p. 110. \\"This is the Rockstar Taste of Chaos Tour, a night when heavier melodic-metalcore bands like Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold intend to position themselves as the next generation of bands to actually pack arenas (...)\\". Bands such as Trivium, As I Lay Dying and Bullet for My Valentine take a significant influence from thrash metal.

Biography Maria was a peasant woman.Pryimachenko Maria, Sixteen Paintings in the National Museum of Ukrainian Folk Art, Shown On A Set of Sixteen Color Postcards Published By Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1979, \\"Art Ukraine\\" site She was born and spent all her life in the village of Bolotnya in the Ivankiv Raion, Kiev Oblast, situated only from Chernobyl.

By reports of her relatives, Maria grew –∞ thoughtful and considerate person, having compassion for nature and every living thing. Her way in art began, by her own words, like this: \\"Once, as a young girl, I was tending a gaggle of geese. When I got with them to a sandy beach, on the bank of the river, after crossing a field dotted with wild flowers, I began to draw real and imaginary flowers with a stick on the sand‚Ä¶ Later, I decided to paint the walls of my house using natural pigments. After that I‚Äôve never stopped drawing and painting.\\" Creative works Wild chaplun. 1977, on Ukrainian postage stampPea beast, 1971, on Ukrainian postage stamp Mysterious and emotionally charged, the works of Maria Pryimachenko, a folk master of Ukrainian decorative painting, seem to absorb the age-old traditions of many generations of Ukrainian master-craftsmen who, from the depths of the centuries, have brought forth their understanding of good and evil, of ugliness and beauty. Images often had –∞—Ä—Ä–µ–∞red to the artist in dreams and later materialized in her compositions. Maria Pryimachenko's art works depict fabulous mythological beasts and take their roots in folk legends and fairy-tales, nourished by real life and culture of the Ukrainian —Ä–µ–æ—Äl–µ. The works of Pryimachenko can be subdivided into thematic, symbolic and ornamental pieces. All compositions are characterized by a subtle and fluent rhythmical arrangement. There is a maxim: \\"Style makes man.\\" As for Pryimachenko, one can state this in reverse: man makes style, for Maria Pryimachenko has developed a style of her own. In this evolution one can discern traces of constructivism (1930s); the victory of harmony (1960s- 1970s); and the decorative approach (1980s). Her latest works impress one by their daring decorativeness of form. Pryimachenko gravitates to the world of fairy-tale and mystery: her birds, beasts and plants interact on her pictures just as harmoniously and easily as they do in natural surroundings. Philosophy of the good animates the content of her works. The good embodied in the images of 'kind' beasts and birds (lions, bears, hares, storks, swallows) is juxtaposed against the evil, this mighty force which is sometimes difficult to identify with certain living things. The artist often resorts to her favoured device of personification: she depicts fabulous animals with large eyes surrounded with a trim of eyelashes. Thematic compositions occupy a special place in Pryimachenko's creative legacy as far as the complexity of compositional arrangement and harmonious balance are concerned. Raw actuality and fairy-tale become blended in her compositions into one single whole, triumphantly demonstrating the unity of Nature. People depicted in these compositions are composed and full of dignity and self-respect. Her early compositions were executed against a white background, associated with the whitewashed walls of peasant cottages. But in the 1970s-1980s the artist turned to coloured backgrounds. It seems that colour itself creates the effect of colour-bearing space. There are no professional secrets in her arsenal: she paints on Whatman paper with factory-manufactured brushes and uses gouache and water colours. She prefers gouache which gives a bright and thick decorative base with graphic contours. Apart from searches in colour scheme, the artist strives to achieve expressive outlines and an effective rhythmical arrangement. Another salient feature of Prymachenko's art is a keen sense of composition, which is especially evident in her choice of format. Horizontal formats are most suitable for topical and multifigured compositions depicting subsequent scenes of the narration, while the vertical format is used for representative decorative compositions. The originality of the artist's imagery is revealed in her unique formal and stylistic discoveries (the depiction of trees, simultaneous representation of a cottage's interior and exterior, etc.). The struggle between good and evil permeates all of Pryimachenko's works. Good always triumphs in her compositions. But the motif of exuberant joy often gives way to sorrow and grief (a grave adorned with flowers and rushnyks is frequently depicted on her pictures). The compositions of Maria Pryimachenko were exhibited all over the former Soviet Union, Ukraine and other countries (Poland, Bulgaria, France and Canada).100th anniversary of the birth of Maria Primachenko, painter (1908-1997), Unesco Portal, year 2008 Her albums were published widely all over the world.

The phrase is often abbreviated as military-style semi-automatic (MSSA). A New Zealand firearms licence-holder requires an E Category endorsement on their licence before they can possess this type of firearm, and a police-issued permit to procure each firearm is required. Arriving at a clear definition and common understanding of which semi-automatic firearms have a military-style configuration has dominated debate about gun-control legislation in New Zealand since 1992. The phrase was introduced as part of the 1992 amendment to the Arms Act that was intended to impose stricter controls on military style semi-automatic firearms following the 1990 Aramoana massacre where a lone gunman, who held a lifetime firearms licence, killed 13 people using several different firearms, including a semi-automatic rifle that he fired from the hip at police. Some semi- automatic firearms that have been sold in a sporting configuration, so that they can be possessed by a person holding a standard (A Category) firearms licence, without endorsements, can be converted to an MSSA simply by adding or changing one part, such as a larger magazine or flash suppressor. If a person intends to convert an A Category firearm that they already possess, they need to obtain an E Category endorsement before making the conversion to their firearm, because merely having parts in the person's possession to make the conversion possible makes an A Category semi-automatic firearm an MSSA. Background New Zealand introduced personal lifetime firearms licences in 1984 and, in the process, abandoned a complex and poorly understood process for registering rifles and shotguns that was often not complied with. The existing registers were fragmented and inaccurate and as a result police did not know who owned firearms and could not find many of the guns that were registered. Existing registered gun owners were usually issued with a lifetime licence if they had previously behaved responsibly with their firearms. On 13 November 1990, Aramoana resident David Gray, after a verbal dispute with his next-door neighbour, went on a shooting rampage that resulted in the deaths of 14 people, including Gray himself, and gunshot injuries to another three people. Another person was injured taking cover. Gray, a firearms licence holder, possessed several firearms, including semi-automatic rifles. Before being apprehended, Gray ran from cover, shooting from the hip at police while daring them to kill him. Minister of Police, John Banks, hastily drafted legislation to amend the Arms Act, \\"to prevent another Aramoana massacre\\" by restricting the configuration, possession and use of semi-automatic weapons, requiring a firearms licence to have a photograph of the licence holder and reducing the term to 10 years with vetting of the licence holder upon relicensing. Definition The definition of an MSSA is in the Arms Act, which together with the Arms Regulations, also specifies the controls over possession and use of MSSAs. The Act is administered by the New Zealand Police. The legislated definition of the features of a military style semi- automatic firearm has evolved over time, along with how that legislation is interpreted by Police, firearms dealers and firearms licence holders. The 2013 version of the Arms Code describes a military style semi-automatic firearm as any \\"self-loading\\" (i.e. semi-automatic) firearm, other than a pistol, with any of the following features: *Folding or telescopic butt *Magazine that holds, or is detachable and has the appearance of holding more than 15 cartridges (for .22 rimfire) * Magazine that holds more than 7 cartridges, or is detachable and has the appearance of holding more than 10 cartridges (for other than a .22 rimfire) *Bayonet lug *Pistol grip as defined by regulation *Flash suppressor Requirements to possess Possession or use of any MSSA requires a firearms licence with either a \\"C\\" or \\"E\\" endorsement. The \\"E\\" endorsement allows MSSAs to be used with live ammunition; while the \\"C\\" endorsement is used by museum curators, collectors, film/TV/theatre armourers, etc. To be granted either endorsement, the applicant must demonstrate to Police good cause for possessing MSSAs and the application must be supported by two referees who are current endorsement holders, serving members of a firearms-related organisation, bona fide collectors or persons able to demonstrate a genuine long-term interest in firearms. The applicant must also demonstrate a higher standard of security for the storage of weapons than is required for ordinary firearms. 2009 reinterpretation On 2 July 2009, the New Zealand Police issued a memorandumPolice memorandum \\"Military Style Semi- Automatics firearms classification\\", 2 July 2009 advising that the police had reviewed the criteria for classifying weapons as MSSAs; and in particular the interpretation of the phrase 'military pattern free-standing pistol grip' used in the legislation. Under the new interpretation, many types of thumbhole stocks were now to be considered as pistol grips for the purposes of the Arms Act; any semi-automatic rifle with a grip having either the appearance or function of a military pattern free-standing pistol grip would be regarded by the police as an MSSA. Specifically, a semi-automatic rifle would henceforth be considered an MSSA if it had any of: * an obvious pistol grip below the trigger guard allowing a full-hand pistol grip, irrespective of whether or not the pistol grip was connected to the stock at the base; * any addition that connects the pistol grip to the stock or butt in an attempt to make it no longer free standing (such as adding a metal or plastic rod); or * a second grip forward of the trigger. This reinterpretation had the effect of re- classifying as MSSAs many weapons previously considered to be sporting- configuration firearms, including the Heckler & Koch SL8 and USC, and the Dragunov sniper rifle. Transitional arrangements were made by the police to allow owners of such weapons to either register them, obtaining the necessary firearms endorsements if required, or dispose of them. The transitional period ended on 31 March 2010. The reinterpreation has met with resistance from some firearm owners. The National Shooters Association of NZ (formed largely as a result of the reinterpretation) laid a complaint on 12 August 2009 with the Independent Police Conduct Authority regarding the advertising of the change. Proceedings had already been lodged by the Association's president Richard Lincoln at the High Court in Palmerston North on 29 June 2009, aiming to have the revised interpretation overturned. In a subsequent hearing for an injunction to protect the litigant, Justice McKenzie ruled that the Police did not have the power to re-classify any firearm and that their opinion on the extended definition of pistol grips was \\"inconsequential\\" and that was a matter for the Court to decide. He also stated that the Court would not be constrained by any other 'opinion'. On 1 March 2010 Justice Mallon released a Reserved Decision upon the Judicial Review, stating that a Military Pattern Free-Standing Pistol grip was not what the Police HQ said it was and that the litigant's H&K; SL8 firearm did not have a Military Pattern Free-Standing Pistol Grip. Justice Mallon discussed the proper interpretation of the terms 'Military Pattern' and 'Free-Standing' in detail. The Police have ceased advertising their opinion and removed reference to the \\"Check Your Stock\\" campaign from their official website.  2012 amendments  The \\"Arms (Military Style Semi-automatic Firearms and Import Controls) Amendment Act 2012\\" aimed to clarify the MSSA definition in regards to Airsoft and Paintball guns, as well as magazine capacities. Amendment summary: * Define a new category, \\"restricted airguns\\", as Paintball and Airsoft pistols/rifles either imitating MSSA's, or capable of fully automatic fire. * Require an import permit for \\"restricted airguns\\". * Specifically exclude \\"restricted airguns\\" from the category \\"especially dangerous airguns\\", i.e. PCP rifles. * Allow the use of centerfire magazines with a capacity of 7 rounds that appear to be capable of holding up to 10 rounds. Intended effect: * Fully automatic Airsoft and Paintball guns will be legal for import, purchase and use for any person (provided they are allowed to use an airgun in the first place). They will no longer be considered a restricted firearm, will be legal to use in sport and will not require an C-category firearms license. * Cheaply available imitation firearms, such as plastic airsoft pistols, will no longer be widely available, reducing the number of armed offenders callouts. * Magazines and firearms designed to hold 10 centerfire rounds (an unofficial international standard, possibly influenced by restrictions in certain American states such as California) can be easily modified to comply with the 7-round A-category restriction by blocking the space required by the last 3 rounds (e.g. welding a short piece of rod inside the bottom of a 10-round magazine).  2019 ban  On the 15th of March, 2019, a far right white supremacist opened fire in two mosques in Christchurch, killing 51 people and 49 injured. The shooter legally-obtained semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. Following this attack, gun law reforms were announced almost immediately, and at 3pm on the 21st of March almost all semi-automatic rifles were banned. All magazines over 10 rounds were banned, and in particular centerfire semi-automatic weapons were banned.Such guns must be confirmed by an act of parliament before 30 June 2020 or they will be revoked. A gun buyback has been offered.

The Architecture of Cesar Department refers to the architecture in the Cesar Department of Colombia, which still preserves much of the colonial architecture inherited by the Spanish colonization and the architecture developed by the numerous tribes of indigenous peoples of the Cesar Department that included the Tairona, Chimila, Motilon and Kalina.Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arango Indigenous architecture Before the arrival of the Spanish the indigenous settlements constructions varied in architectural techniques. Most of the base of the houses were constructed with stones glued together with clay on a flattened terrain, the walls were made using a bareke mix, miking clay, intricate sticks and hay to create solid walls. The roof had a frame of solid sticks forming a cone and covered tightly in grass or palm branches. Indigenous like the Arhuacos had developed villages in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range which interconnected their houses through a system of stone roads and steps. This type of architecture is still practiced in certain indigenous tribes settlements. Spanish architecture The Molina-Cespedes house and La Concepci√≥n church in the Alfonso Lopez main plaza, Valledupar. Upon the arrival of the Spanish in the region during the early 16th Century, their construction techniques were used for their new settlements which were isolated haciendas in the middle of a large extension of land. Villages had very few houses and were usually built by a church and a commons plaza which was use for the pasture of the horses and cattle. The first houses were constructed using oven made clay bricks, wooden pillars and clay tiles. Houses usually had a single or two floors, squared with a garden in the middle, surrounded by numerous rooms. The doors, windows and balconies were made of wood with metal hinges and nails. Some street roads were covered with stones. This type of architecture is still used in certain isolated villages in the Cesar Department. Colombian architecture Based on standards set by the Colombian government on architectural techniques standards the development in construction began in the 20th Century with the use of cement, river sand and iron based on advancement of the Industrial Revolution.
