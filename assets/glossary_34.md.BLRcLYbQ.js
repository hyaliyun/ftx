Padmanabha was the leader of EPRLF and he was murdered with 12 of his party men and two commoners in Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu on 19 June 1990. The incident marked the first occasion when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eezham (LTTE), a militant organization, targeted an attack outside Sri Lanka. The case had lot of political implications as the ruling DMK government in Tamil Nadu was overturned considered this incident and the assassination of ex-prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. Pottu Amman (a leader of LTTE), Ravichandran were in the list of accused. A special investigation team was formulated with the name Tamil Nadu Special Investigation Team (TANSIT) by the Government of Tamil Nadu. It framed chargesheet against 22 people. The trial was held in a special TADA court formed in Chennai and 17 accused faced the trial. The court pronounced verdict on 22 November 1998 and sentenced Gundu Santhan and Anandraj to six and five year rigorous imprisonment. The court also ordered the Government of Tamil Nadu to pay a compensation of 2 lakh to the family of the deceased. Background LTTE is a militant outfit which was fighting for the welfare of the Tamils in northern parts of Sri Lanka, against the suppression by majority Sinhanlese domination. India has active links with Sri Lanka and its politics from historic times and the association continued during the modern times as well. There were other organizations like EPRLF, which was fighting the cause of Tamils in a peaceful manner for Tamil welfare. Incident Padmanabha was the leader of EPRLF and he was murdered with 12 of his party men and two commoners in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu on 19 June 1990. Padmanabha and the other EPRLF leaders were having a meeting in Zachria Colony in Kodambakkam, a suburb in Chennai. There were two armed men, who came in an Ambassador car, which they earlier stole from Villupuram, a town from Chennai. Before the inmates could escape, they sprayed bullets on all the 13 men in the house. While escaping, they shot and killed two other pedestrians. Along with Padmanabha, the Finance Minister in the now defunct Northeastern Provincial Council P. Kirubakaran, and Member of Parliament Yogasankari, were also killed. The accused were believed to have escaped to Sri Lanka by travelling all the way from Chennai to Vedaranyam by road and then taking a boat to northern Sri Lanka. All the injured were taken to the Government hospital where they were pronounced dead. Political implications The incident marked the first occasion when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eezham (LTTE), targeted an attack outside Sri Lanka. The Tamil Nadu government was then ruled by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) under M. Karunanidhi. The DMK government was accused of ensuring a smooth escapade route to the outfit. During the subsequent months, Rajiv Gandhi, the ex-prime minister and prime ministerial leader of Congress party was killed in a suicide attack on 21 May 1991 in Sriperumbudur in the outskirts of Chennai. The ruling DMK government was accused of helping the LTTE. The state government was dismissed before the Rajiv Gandhi assassination. It was also alleged the intelligence bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were not following the activities of the LTTE in the state. Many political experts saw close connection in both the attacks and assert that had the attackers of Padmanabha been controlled, attempts on Rajiv Gandhi would not have been possible. As per one version, the then Director General of Police (DGP) Durai, committed suicide as he was pressurised by the ruling DMK not to link LTTE. Chargesheet A special investigation team was formulated with the name Tamil Nadu Special Investigation Team (TANSIT) by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The investigation chargesheet accused 26 people of conspiring the attack. Sivarasan and Gundu Santhan, who were also charged in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, were primed accused in the case. Kiruban, another accused escaped from police custody. Six others, namely, Pottu Amman, Daniel, David, Dileepan, Ravi and Nagaraja - were declared proclaimed offenders and since they were absconding. Trial The trial of the case was held in the TADA court, specially formulated for the case in Poonamallee in Chennai. The 17 accused in the order from A1 to A18, Chinna Santhan, Vicky, R. Nagarajan (Home secretary of Government of Tamil Nadu), Rajan alias Kunjan, T.V. Marudanayagam, Jayabalasingham, Chandravadana (wife of Jayabalasingham), Vasanthan, Anandaraj, Sebastian, Mahendran, Gunaraja, Irumborai, D. Veerasekaran, Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan (minister in the ruling DMK government in Tamil Nadu), Jagadeesan (Subbulakshmi's husband) and Ravichandran (brother of prominent politician Vaiko) faced the trial. The prosecution argued that the conspiracy was hatched in Jaffna, Trichy and Chennai and Pottu Amman was the mastermind. Gundu Santhan joined an engineering institute in Chennai to monitor the activities of EPRLF leaders. He informed the team of Sivarajan, David, Dileepan, Daniel and Ravi, who arrived on 10 June 1990. The assailants reached the spot, killed the leaders of EPRLF and fled in a Maruthi car to Pillaiyar Thidal in Thanjavur District and fled to Sri Lanka in a boat from there. The court examined 206 witnesses and pronounced the judgement on 22 November 1997. It ruled that there were no concrete evidence on the first eight accused to have conspired the murder. The prosecution argument that R. Nagarajan, the home secretary, had instructed the police personnel not to act against the assailants, was also quashed for absolute lack of evidence. The court also rejected the argument that Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan and Jagadeesan housed Gundu Santhan in their house in Erode. Similar charges against Ravichandran and Veerasekaran was also dropped. The court indicted the Tamil Nadu police for their inefficiency and ordered the Government of Tamil Nadu to compensate 2 lakh rupees to the family of the deceased. The court declared two of the seventeen guilty, of which, Chinna Santhan was Section 3 (3) of TADA for advising, abetting and facilitating the crime and Anandaraj was found guilty under Section 3 (4) of TADA for harbouring Gundu Santhan. Chinna Santhan was sentenced to six years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) with a fine of 2,000, failing the payment of which, he has to undergo one more year of imprisonment and Anandaraj was sentenced to five years RI with a fine of 1,000, failure to paying which will attract another six months of imprisonment.

Enormously successful in Jamaica, the film also reached the international market and has been described as \\"possibly the most influential of Jamaican films and one of the most important films from the Caribbean\\".Mennel, Barbara, Cities and Cinema, Routledge, 2008, p.170. Plot Ivanhoe \\"Ivan\\" Martin is a poor Jamaican man in desperate search of work. He leaves his rural home after his grandmother dies to live with his impoverished wastrel mother in Kingston, but is rebuffed. Before he can even locate her he has all his possessions stolen in a con by a street vendor he naively trusted. He later meets Jose, who takes him to see Django, a Spaghetti Western. Excited by urban life, he tries to get a job but repeatedly fails. He finally drifts into the circle of a Christian preacher. There he finds menial work, and in his spare time he turns an abandoned bicycle frame into a working bicycle, then uses it to run errands for his new boss. He gets into trouble with the preacher after he shows sexual interest in the Preacher's young virginal female ward, Elsa, then with her assistance uses his church for rehearsing secular songs he intends to record. After being brusquely run off by the preacher he returns to the church compound to collect his bicycle, but finds an older, much bigger former colleague has appropriated it. Challenged to take it back, Ivan does so, avoiding a broken bottle his opponent wields before slashing the man with a knife, for which he is sentenced by the local authorities to a violent whipping. Ivan interests a prominent record producer in a song he writes and performs, \\"The Harder They Come\\", but in spite of trying to wrangle more only gets the standard exploitative $20 offer for it. He dreams of stardom upon its release, but the stranglehold the producer maintains on the local music industry through payola condemns Ivan to obscurity. He takes up with his lover, who has been violently driven away in a jealous rage by the preacher for \\"fornication\\". Eventually Jose offers Ivan an opportunity to make a modest living running marijuana, moving the drug from the country to the city on a motorbike as part of a large police-protected network. When Ivan complains about the poor pay and what he obtusely believes is high risk, being oblivious to the collusion with the authorities that makes the thriving enterprise possible, Jose sets up a take-down for him with the corrupt local police official running the protection racket, Detective Jones. On Ivan's next trip he is flagged down by a policeman who routinely had waved him by, panics, and shoots the officer, who dies from his wounds and crashing his motorcycle. Next, Ivan has a tryst with Jose's girlfriend. While he is in bed with her, the police surround the room and try to capture him. He shoots his way out, killing three officers. On the run, he returns to shoot and wound the girl, believing she and Jose betrayed him. He then finds Jose and pursues him, shooting at him but missing. Ivan returns to the countryside. He is again betrayed and the police catch up with him, leading to another shootout and escape. Ivan seeks support from his closest drug-dealer friend, Pedro, who helps him hide out. Jones, tasked with rounding Ivan up, temporarily shuts down his lucrative protection racket in order to starve the entire community its network financially supports into ratting Ivan out. Meanwhile, the record mogul re-releases Ivan's song in order to capitalize on his notoriety, which becomes a hit and fans his fame as a charismatic rebel. Enamoured of this image, Ivan has staged photographs of himself made posing as a flagrant two- gun outlaw. He sends them to the press, which is resistant to print them. He then steals a flashy car from a resort hotel and drives it aimlessly around the countryside in a reverie. Pedro then advises Ivan to escape to Cuba. A rendezvous with a vessel bound there is arranged, but Ivan is ambushed by a police assault team while seeking to approach it and is unable to drag himself up a boarding ladder thrown over its stern. He passes out from his wound and finds himself beached ashore. The police approach, armed with automatic rifles; he comes out, holding his two guns, and is shot. The film ends with a woman's torso gyrating to the sound of Ivan's song over the credits.

Prior to filming, the project had a working title of Rhygin.Cooke, Mel (2013) \\"From 'Rhygin' To 'The Harder They Come' - Movie Changes Names During Production\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 8 September 2013.

According to Henzell, \\"Black people seeing themselves on the screen for the first time created an unbelievable audience reaction\\". The film was released in February 1973 in New York City by Roger Corman's New World Pictures to little attention. It became more popular when it was played to midnight audiences nationwide the following April.

The father was a cyclo driver, and his desire was the son would have a better life than he had. However, after the father's death, because of the family hardship, the boy has to take over the father's job, pedaling a rental cyclo around busy streets of Ho Chi Minh City to earn a living. Living with the boy in a small house, there are his old grandfather, who repairs tires despite of his failing health, his little sister, who shines shoes for restaurant customers in the neighborhood, and his older sister, who carries water at a local market. Their poor but peaceful lives are jeopardized when the cyclo is stolen by a gang. Having no money to pay for the robbed cyclo, the boy is forced to join a criminal organization and is under the supervision of a brooding gang leader, who is also a poet. Meanwhile, his older sister also comes under the influence of the poet and becomes a prostitute. They develop feelings for each other. She visits his house where he is beaten by his father, who is furious for the profession he has taken. The poet brings the cyclo driver to \\"Mr. Lullaby,\\" who kills a victim by slitting his throat while singing a lullaby. Ho Chi Minh City is hit by unrest as different gangs start fighting with each other. A truck carrying a helicopter crashes on a busy city-street. The cyclo driver blinds one eye of the man who stole his cyclo, but manages to remain unseen by anyone. He pays another visit to his lady employer to pay a part of his debt, but she refuses and becomes busy with her mentally disabled son who has covered himself with yellow paint. The poet assigns the cyclo driver the job of murdering a man. His two accomplices give him a gun and teach him how to kill their intended target. They also hand him a bottle of pills to reduce his anxiety, but warn him not to take too many. The poet and the cyclo driver's sister visit his childhood place. He leaves her in a nightclub with a client and she is abused by the man. Both the poet and the man realize their mistakes and the man tries to compensate by bribing the poet with a hefty sum of money. But the poet kills the man and then kills himself by setting fire to the room where he lives. Meanwhile, the disabled son of the lady is killed when he is hit by a truck. The cyclo driver gets drunk and takes two tablets of the drug he has received from the poet's accomplices. He becomes hallucinatory in the flat where he has been forced to stay, failing to carry out the job of killing the man. Instead, he covers himself with blue paint and then due to the hallucinations he mistakenly shoots himself twice. The next morning, the members of the gang find him badly injured but still alive, and the lady spares his life despite his failure because he reminds her of her deceased son. She releases him from the gang.

Ohio NOW has 9 total chapters located in Akron, Ashtabula, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Oberlin, Port Clinton, and Toledo. The National Organization for Women is a non-partisan, non-profit organization funded by private donations and membership dues.  Goals  The Ohio NOW chapter focuses on six main issues: reproductive rights, ending sex discrimination/constitutional equality, promoting diversity and ending racism, economic justice, stopping violence against women, and lesbian rights including marriage equality.  Priorities  Specific issues that have been or are currently a focus of the Ohio National Organization for Women. = Abortion = Access to safe abortions in Ohio is becoming increasingly difficult due to Ohio abortion laws and the attempts to close many of Ohio's abortion clinics. Ohio NOW is working towards keeping the Center for Choice abortion clinic open in Toledo by attempting to find a transfer clinic for the center's patients. = Campus Sexual Assault = The organization works with Changing Campus Culture, an initiative started by the Ohio Department of Higher Education, to help prevent and respond to sexual violence occurring on state campuses. The initiative received $2 million from the state budget to focus on individual campus needs, training programs, and individual grants. The initiative seeks to prevent sexual violence based on received input from campus presidents, advocacy groups, and community experts in order to create recommended practices.  Recommendations  # Use data to guide action. # Empower staff, faculty, campus law enforcement and students to prevent and respond to sexual violence through evidence-based training. # Communicate a culture of shared respect and responsibility. # Develop a comprehensive response policy. # Adopt a survivor-centered response. = Equal Pay = Ohio NOW and the National branch work with the Department of Labor to decrease the pay gap between men and women. On average, full-time working women earn just 78 cents for every dollar a man earns.  Ohio Equal Pay Act  Ohio State Rep. Kathleen Clyde (D-Kent) and Rep.

The Bill addresses causes of the pay gap and is divided into three components: # Requires state and local governments to determine the value of comparable work across job categories and to eliminate lower pay that is sometimes associated with \\"women work.\\" Value of the work is measured across job categories as a composite of the skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions normally required in the performance of the work. # Requires businesses that receive state contracts or state economic incentive funds to be certified with an Equal Pay Certificate indicating that women employees at the company have access to the same opportunities and pay as their male counterparts as well as information from the company about how their salaries compare with male employees. # Prohibits retaliation against employees in any employment actions‚Äîsuch as hiring, firing and promotion decisions for sharing salary information amongst themselves. = Steubenville High School = The Ohio NOW organization was on the forefront of the Steubenville High School rape case.

The film won the Cam√©ra d'Or prize at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, a C√©sar Award for Best Debut at the French annual film award ceremony, and was nominated for the 1993 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The Scent of Green Papaya is Tran Anh Hung's first feature film and stars his wife, Tran Nu Y√™n-Kh√™. The film is also the director's first collaboration with Vietnamese composer T√¥n- Th√¢t Ti√™t who would subsequently write the music for two more films: Cyclo and Vertical Ray of the Sun. Although set in Vietnam, the film was shot entirely on a soundstage in Boulogne, France. Plot A young girl, M√πi, becomes a servant for a rich family. M√πi is notably peaceful and curious about the world. The family consists of a frequently absent husband, a wife, an older son, two younger sons, and the husband's mother. When the husband leaves for his fourth and final time, he takes all the household's money. He returns ill and passes away shortly after. Ten years later, the family falls on hard times. Two sons have left and the wife has taken the place of the grandmother upstairs, rarely seen and tragic. Although the wife now realizes she considered M√πi one of her own, M√πi changes homes. She becomes a servant for a pianist who was a friend of the older son when they were younger. That man is engaged to be married, but he prefers playing the piano to spending time with his fianc√©e. One night, as the fianc√©e chatters on, his piano playing becomes more and more stormy as he ignores her. When she leaves she watches through the window. As M√πi comes into the room, his music becomes more harmonious. Later that night, the pianist goes to M√πi's quarters after dark and closes the door behind him. When the fianc√©e learns of this, the engagement is broken. The pianist starts teaching M√πi to read and write as well as to behave as a lady. In the end, pregnant M√πi reads poetry to her husband, her unborn child, and the wife of her original household.

In addition to being one of the leading slow lob bowlers of the 1850s, he was responsible for important advances in the development of cricketing equipment; notably cane-handled bats and open-cane batting pads. He also patented an early mechanical bowling machine.  Cricket career  Nixon was born on 4 June 1815 in Nottingham. He was originally a lace maker by profession and he did not make his debut for Nottinghamshire until 1841. He continued to play sporadically for the County but his career only really blossomed when he joined the MCC staff at Lord's in 1851, taking 9 wickets in an innings and 14 in the match for MCC against Middlesex in his debut season. Over the next decade he established himself as one of the leading slow bowlers in the Country and represented the All England Eleven, the Players and played in the important annual North versus the South matches. He also played in other first-class matches for the Slow Bowlers against the Fast Bowlers and for the Over Thirties against the Under Thirties. Described as a lob bowler with 'much twist' he took 264 wickets in 54 first-class matches at an average of 9.98.Some sources refer to him as a slow round-arm bowler, e.g.; Philip Bailey, Philip Thorn and Peter Wynne-Thomas, Who's Who of Cricketers (London, 1984), p. 749. Nixon was a right-handed batsman who scored 338 runs at an average of 4.84. Despite this unimpressive record he played as an opening batsman on several occasions. His highest first-class score was 34 for MCC against the All England Eleven. His first-class career ended in the late 1850s and in 1861 he moved to Oxford and then to Cheshire. He continued to play in non-first class matches, and throughout his career played as a guest professional for numerous sides. One of his most remarkable performances was for a XXII of Herefordshire against the All England Eleven in 1851; he returned figures of 74.3‚Äì43‚Äì44‚Äì6 as England were bowled out for 130, the XXII of Herefordshire still lost by an innings. He also frequently umpired at Lord's.  Cricket inventions  Nixon's innovations can be seen as a response to the increase in fast-bowling in Cricket from the 1840s. He experimented with cork batting pads before introducing Malayan malacca and cane rattan open pads in 1853. He also used the strength and flexibility of cane in bat design. His cane-handled bat helped to absorb the shock imparted to the batsman by the fast round-arm bowlers of the day. Nixon also took out a patent on his 'Balista' bowling machine in 1862. This contraption was designed as an improvement on the 'Catapult' machine in being able to replicate round-arm bowling. The ball was propelled by a vulcanised rubber sling which could be modified to provide variations in the speed and length of delivery. By 1864 the Balista was being demonstrated in Australia where local reporters attested to the ingenuity of the machine.  Family life  Nixon had two cricketing sons; Thomas Henry Nixon was also on the MCC Staff, and Reuben Nixon represented the Gentlemen of Cheshire and the Gentlemen of Shropshire. Thomas Henry Nixon's son, Harry Nixon also played for Scotland. Thomas Nixon died on 20 July 1877 at Chelford, Cheshire.

Education He studied at the Gobelins School of the Image. Career He started his career at Disney in 1990 with DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp, working as an animator and animation supervisor, until 2006 with The Fox and the Hound 2. He was an animator on the character Claude Frollo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame. He also worked as a supervisor animator on such films as Hercules (on the characters Titans and Cyclops), Tarzan (on the character Sabor), and The Emperor's New Groove. When he was hired by Roy E. Disney to direct the animated short film Destino, a long-time collaboration between the painter Salvador Dal√≠ and Walt Disney, it was Monf√©ry's first film as a Director.http://www.awn.com/vfxworld/channeling-dali-make-destino When the Disney feature animation in Paris closed, although he continued to work with Disney until 2006, Monf√©ry co-created Welldone Films. His first feature film was the French-Canadian Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure in 2006. He then directed the French-Italian feature film Eleanor's Secret, which was shown at the Rome Film Festival. Both of these films were produced by Gaumont Animation, formerly known under the name of Alphanim. Monf√©ry is also an illustrator for graphic novels, his first work being Tin Lizze, edited and distributed by Swiss Editions Paquet (2015), on a story based on the first cars, the Ford Model T, Tin Lizzie.http://www.paquet.li/bd/auteurs/monfery Monfery at Editions Paquet The first part was released end of January 2015, and the second part was released early July 2015. The scenario is written by Thierry Chafouin, who was also working with Disney as a storyboard artist, and their long-time experience in animation is greatly appreciated since the layout of this historical graphic novel is very important for its concept. Monf√©ry also created the concept and animation of Au Fil de l' Eau (On Flying Water), an animated short musical film on the metaphor of life (little water drops) where the animation and music with sound effects are acting as a whole, music being a narration. The film already earned several distinctions throughout the year, some shared between Monf√©ry and the producer and composer Julia Pajot, both for the concept and the original score.

After Silungkang uprising, he left West Sumatra and went to Batavia joined with Indonesian National Party. In 1937, he moved to Singapore and Malaya. There he made a contact with Tan Malaka. Influenced by Tan Malaka's concept, he established Parti Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya and envisaged a socialist platform for the party. During the declaration day of PKMM policies, 30 November 1945, he revealed 8 resolutions which were considered influenced by the Communist Party of Malaya by the British colonists. Furthermore, PKMM's anti-UMNO and anti-British movement and activities were worried by the British. Due to this, the British refused Parti Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya's registration under the Malayan's establishment law. Later, Mokhtaruddin, along with few other anti-British leaders were imprisoned and presumably executed.

He captured three world championship titles under the youth level, and eventually competed as a member of Team GB's archery squad at the 2016 Summer Olympics, losing the second round match to the eventual champion Ku Bon-chan of South Korea.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/37153742 Huston currently trains full-time under senior national coach Richard Priestman for Archery UK, while remaining a loyal founding member of East Belfast Archery Club.  Early life  Born and raised in Belfast to parents Adrian and Felicity Huston, both of whom previously worked as tax inspectors, Huston became involved in archery as an eight-year-old pupil at Cabin Hill Primary School. Under the tutelage of British longbow champion and his teacher Audrey Needham, Huston began to show his potential to the sport by joining and serving as a mainstay of Campbell College's archery club. Upon his entry to the Northern Ireland Elite Squad as a fourteen-year-old, Huston trained part-time as an archer, and eventually started competing in both local and regional tournaments regularly. In September 2011, Huston founded his very own East Belfast Archery Club across the Tullycarnet Community Centre. In 2014 he left Campbell College to train full-time at Lillleshall National Sporting Centre.  Career  The 2013 season saw him rising to the prominence on the international archery scene, collecting a set of two gold medals each in the individual and team recurve respectively at the World Youth Championships in Wuxi, China. With his untimely success in archery, Huston was named by the British Olympic Committee (BOA) as one of the country's prospective sportspeople nominated for the 2013 Olympic Athlete of the Year award. Huston continued to extend his career resume through the 2014 and 2015 season by eclipsing the world 70-metre record at the Archery GB National Series in Exmouth, and by capturing his first individual gold medal under the senior division at the opening stage of the World Archery Cup series in Marrakech, Morocco. Leading up to his Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro, Huston won a bronze medal in the men's individual recurve at the 2016 European Championships in Nottingham to secure a quota place on Team GB's Olympic archery squad. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Huston was selected to compete as a lone male archer for the British squad, shooting only in the individual recurve tournament. First, he recorded a total score of 656 points, including 22 targets of a perfect ten, to obtain the thirty-eighth seed from a field of 64 archers in the classification round. Heading to the knockout stage on the third day of the Games, Huston confidently overcame the Dutchman and London 2012 fourth-place finalist Rick van der Ven with a two-set advantage at 6‚Äì4 in the opening round, before he lost his subsequent match on three straight sets to the eventual champion Ku Bon-chan of South Korea. September 2017 saw him make history by becoming the first archer to win the Great Britain National Series Recurve title three times in a row. As of October 2017 he is ranked 18 in the World. In May 2019, Huston was selected to compete in the 2019 European Games in Minsk, Belarus joining over 100 other athletes in 10 different sports.

He was first elected to the Senate in March 2015, to represent Akwa Ibom North-East Senatorial District and he won re-election for a second time in the February 2019 senatorial elections. He is a member of the People's Democratic Party.  Background  Senator Bassey Albert Akpan was born on October 28, 1972 into the family of Chief Albert Robert Akpan, a successful businessman, prominent politician and philanthropist, in Ididep Usuk village, Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area. He is a grassroots politician who represented Akwa Ibom North-East Senatorial District at the 8th Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Previously, he was Commissioner of Finance in Akwa Ibom State from 2007 to 2014. He was elected to the Senate in March 2015, under the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and was reelected in February 2019, to represent Akwa Ibom North-East Senatorial District at the 9th Senate. Senator Albert started his secondary education at the St Patrick's College, Calabar before proceeding to the University of Uyo, where he bagged a Bachelor's degree in Economics (Second Class Upper Division). In further pursuit of academic excellence, he obtained a Master's Degree in Business Administration (MBA) from the prestigious University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Career He started his professional career in 1997, when he joined the International Operations and Consumer Banking/Retail Banking Unit of the United Bank for Africa (UBA). In 1999, he moved on to become Manager, Corporate Banking group at the Continental Trust Bank at the bank's Victoria Island Lagos, Head Office. He later joined First Inland Bank Plc in 2003 as the Uyo Branch Manager, where he won the bank's best performing branch manager award in the South-South region. He also won the award of the best performing branch manager nationwide in the bank's mid-year review of the 2004 financial year. In 2005, he joined First City Monument Bank as Assistant Vice President, where he was the General Manager in charge of Akwa Ibom and Cross River States. He was responsible for directing and overseeing the day-to-day running of over 15 branches spread across the zone and as the Zonal Head, he articulated and developed key market penetration strategies for the bank, for sustainable market share and growth. Political career In 2007, when the call to public service came through his nomination as a commissioner into the Executive Council of the Akwa Ibom state government, he accepted and was handed the Finance Ministry to manage. With his wealth of experience in the banking sector and background as an Economist, he was able to grow the State's Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), to N15.6 billion as at the last quarter of 2013. He was also the Chairman of the Inter-ministerial Direct Labour Coordinating Committee whose job was to ensure that government projects were completed using direct labour to save funds for the state. He saw through successful completion of over 6000 life-touching projects in the health and education sectors, as well as areas of rural and human capital development. In April 2009, Albert chaired the first ever Akwa Ibom state Revenue summit. The Summit with the theme: \\"Maximising Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) potentials in Akwa Ibom State - A Collective Responsibility\\" had in attendance stakeholders from diverse socio-economic sectors in the state and was organized as part of strategic efforts to boost the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the state. He was instrumental in the negotiations between the state and Standard Chartered Bank for the approval of a loan of ¬£325.24m to execute projects in the state In 2014, Senator Albert declared his intention to contest for the Governorship seat of Akwa Ibom State. Even though he was a front-line aspirant, he decided to respect, as a loyal party man, the zoning policy of his party (PDP), which paved way for Eket Senatorial District to produce Mr Udom Gabriel Emmanuel as Governor of the State. He further contested and won the Senatorial seat under the umbrella of the PDP and was sworn in as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on 9 June 2015. Senate career Albert was sworn in as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on 9 June 2015. Albert distinguished himself in character and performance at the Senate, with the sponsorship of several bills, motions, petitions and other matters of strategic relevance, not minding the fact he was a first timer. He moved a motion on the floor of the Senate to look into the state of the Ikot Ekpene - Itu - Calabar highway which had been abandoned for years and was in state of disrepair. This led the senate to inaugurate a committee of which he was a member. On 12 October 2015, his election was upheld by the Appeal court which confirmed him as the senator representing Akwa Ibom North East senatorial district. He was also appointed as the Chairman of the Senate committee on Gas Resources by the 8th Senate President, Bukola Saraki . His committee turned down a proposal of N200 million in the budget of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources for the preparation of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). The committee also rejected a request for appropriation of N200 million for the review of Nigeria Gas Master-plan, describing it as unnecessary. He chaired the Senate Committee on Gas Resources, whose contribution to the development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas sector cannot be overemphasized, one of such being the ‚ÄòGas Flaring Penalty and Prohibition Bill‚Äô recently passed by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He was disqualified from the senate on the 27th of February 2017 by the High Court of Nigeria who nullified his election to the Senate. On November 30, 2017 after several investigations and court hearings the Court of Appeal in Calabar overturned the ruling by the Federal High Court in Uyo, and declared Albert the winner of the primary election that was conducted in December 2014. In May 2016, Senator Albert initiated an undergraduate Scholarship scheme, which 381 students of Akwa Ibom State origin have so far benefited from. The Scholarship covers full tuition fees and upkeep allowance throughout the duration of the beneficiary's programme. As at the beginning of the 2019/2020 academic session, 114 have successfully graduated and obtained degrees, while 267 are still on their respective programmes in various higher institutions of learning across Nigeria. His unparalleled performance in his first term propelled the people of Uyo Senatorial District (Akwa Ibom North- East) to overwhelmingly vote for him to return to the National Assembly as Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, in the 2019 General elections. In the 9th Senate, he was appointed chairman of the Committee on Upstream Petroleum Resources, and a member of several other committees by the 9th Senate President H.E. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan.

The trail passes by several basketball courts, and is a very popular trail for jogging and dog-walking. During very rainy periods, many (if not all) of the \\"fair weather crossings\\" may become impassible. These crossings mostly consist of flat, cylindrical concrete columns forming a step-way across the stream.http://www.restonpaths.com/SugarlandRun/GeneralInfo.htm During less rainy periods, stream crossings tend to not be very deep, and most dogs can usually traverse the crossing without completely submerging. Sugarland Run Stream Valley Trail The first section of the trail, from Sugarland Road to Runnymeade Park, was constructed prior to 1997. In 1998, with funding from a settlement with Colonial Pipeline Company for an oil spill and federal TEA-21 and CMAQ funding, design work began on a 1 mile extension to connect the trail to the Washington & Old Dominion Trail. Construction on the extension began in 2004 and completed in October of 2005. It included almost 6,000 linear feet of paved trail, eight bridges for stream crossings and a boardwalk through a wetland area. In 2019 nearly 12,000 liner feet of the trail were repaired.

Quiet Revolution was formally launched in 2015 based on principles in Susan Cain‚Äôs 2012 book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. Background On January 24, 2012, Susan Cain published the non-fiction book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, becoming the focus of Time magazine's February 6, 2012 cover article and delivering a February 28, 2012 TED talk whose video reached its first million views faster than any previous TED video. Her work became widely known, with Quiet reaching The New York Times Best Seller list for non-fiction and, through August 2015, selling two million copies. Cain delivered over 100 speeches, sometimes receiving five figures for an appearance, as well as doing pro bono presentations. Cain had been considering simply writing a second book on a different topic, but reader feedback convinced her that there was more to be done for introverts. After receiving the advice of author and marketer Seth Godin concerning what would actually change peoples‚Äô lives, Cain decided instead to formally found a Quiet Revolution organization. Cain had informally urged people to join ‚Äúthe Quiet Revolution‚Äù as early as March 2012 on her thepowerofintroverts.com website, before it was subsumed under the formal company‚Äôs quietrev.com website in 2015. Structure, principals and facilities Cain's second TED Talk (March 2014) formally announced Quiet Revolution as a ‚Äúventure backed, mission-based‚Äù company. First headquartered near Nyack, New York and later in a Harlem brownstone, it is a for-profit company, having raised US$4.5 million in startup capital. Cain co-founded the company with Paul Scibetta, a former senior executive at J. P. Morgan Chase. As a management training arm within Quiet Revolution, Cain and Scibetta set up a Quiet Leadership Institute with chief executive (July 2015) Mike Erwin, a former professor of leadership and psychology at the U.S. Military Academy. Early members of the Board of Advisors included Douglas Conant (Campbell Soup former CEO), Adam Grant (Wharton School of Business) and Amy Cuddy (Harvard Business School). Quiet Revolution‚Äôs facilities and practices incorporate non- traditional elements, including operating from a Victorian house facing the Hudson River, and having a policy that meetings not start before 12:30 p.m. By explicit design, the company hires a blend of introverts (like Cain) and extroverts (like Scibetta). As of August 2015 Quiet Revolution had a 12-person team, plus over thirty writers providing content for the company website. Mission and processes Quiet Revolution website‚Äôs mission statement is ‚Äúto unlock the power of introverts for the benefit of us all.‚Äù The overarching goal of the company has been described as rebalancing the power between extroverts and introverts. Quiet Revolution targets broad categories such as children, life, and work. Stated initiatives include transforming office architecture to combat the erosion of focus and privacy in modern offices, using the Quiet Leadership Institute to help organizations train introverted leaders, and empowering quiet children. More concretely, the company formed an online education course for parents, a co-branded lifestyle section in The Huffington Post, a podcast, a website to support a community including writers and advocates, and young-adult books and shows whose heroines are quiet leaders. The Quiet Schools Network was formed with a stated mission to create Quiet Schools that are characterized by \\"an inclusive culture in which everyone is recognized for their potential to learn and lead in authentic ways\\"; the network's member schools focus on topics such as modifying class participation models, using social media in education, designing schools' physical environments, and implementing approaches such as \\"think/pair/share\\" and peer-to-peer teaching. The Quiet Leadership Institute arm of the company uses both in-person and online classes to help executives understand the strengths of introverted employees, harness their power, improve communication between introverts and extroverts, and run meetings so as not to be dominated by loud colleagues. The Institute partnered with office furniture design firm Steelcase to design Susan Cain Quiet Spaces, which are quiet- and privacy- conscious workspaces countering the trend toward open plan offices. At first the company focused on large clients (GE, P&G;, NASA, LinkedIn), but expanded by early 2016 to small companies and entrepreneurial startups, advising on content for introvert-related management practices. Quiet Revolution implemented a Quiet Ambassador initiative, involving the training of volunteers to be embedded in schools, businesses and other participating organizations. After training, ambassadors may advocate, for example, for fewer joint projects, more advance notice of meeting agendas, separate spaces for individual solitude, or fostering communication among co-workers of opposite temperament. In schools, the Quiet Ambassador program tailors teaching and grading approaches to students' temperaments in preference to the conventional one-size-fits-all approach, and favors recognition of student engagement over conventional grading based on class participation. The program introduces ‚Äúthink‚Äìpair‚Äìshare,‚Äù in which students discuss their ideas with one other student before speaking to the full class.

They served as rest areas for travelers embarking on the rough journey that spanned at least nine hours. History The need for a stagecoach line between San Francisco and San Jose was spurred by rapid growth in the San Francisco Bay Area during the California Gold Rush. Peninsula mile houses were built along the route and named according to how many miles they sat from either the San Francisco Ferry Building or Mission San Francisco de As√≠s. Many of these simple rest stops for travelers and their horses evolved into thriving businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and saloons. List of Peninsula Mile Houses 1 Mile House, or Abbey House, was located in Daly City, California. 3 Mile House was located near what is now the Interstate 280 (California)/Bayshore Freeway. 4 Mile House was located about a mile north of the 5 Mile House. 5 Mile House is located in San Francisco at 3600 San Bruno Avenue (Between Girard Street and Wilde Avenue), but no longer has any ground- floor business operating. In its heyday, it was a prominent stop because it was the last Mile House in San Francisco city limits, and because it was at the end of the Third Street rail line, which was built in 1894. 6 Mile House was the first Mile House outside of the San Francisco City limits. 7 Mile House was built in 1858 in Brisbane, California and is the only active mile house standing in its original location. In its early days, 7 Mile House was known to be a hub for gangsters, including members of the notorious Hayes Valley Gang, and eventually evolved into a brothel. It was a speakeasy during Prohibition in the United States in the 1920s, and by the 1980s, it had become an illegal ‚Äúgambling den.\\" In spite of its seedy past, 7 Mile House is one of the oldest bars in the San Francisco Bay Area, a live music venue, and a family/dog-friendly restaurant serving American, Italian, and Filipino food. Vanessa Garcia is the current owner.http://brisbanechamber.org/Luminary2013/January2013Luminary.pdf http://7milehouse.com/ 12 Mile House was located in South San Francisco, California. 14 Mile House (nicknamed Uncle Tom's Cabin) was built in 1849 in San Bruno, California.

As an undergraduate at Howard University, Holmes played quarterback and became the team captain of the Howard Bison football and baseball teams. Additionally, he became the president of the first tennis team at Howard, was a member of the debate and glee clubs. He earned a B.A. degree in 1901 and was valedictorian of the graduating class. Afterwards, Holmes continued his collegiate studies at Columbia University, where he earned both a M.A. and Ph.D. In 1934, he wrote The Evolution of the Negro College, a book focusing on the evolution of the Negro Colleges (what's now referred to as HBCUs), and the resources that these institutions should provide to the African-American population in the Southern states of the U.S. post-Civil War. Holmes died on September 7, 1963 at the age of 85.

It was sanctioned in 1994, and established that prisoners detained without a definitive sentence would be benefited from the second year onwards, so that their days as detained would count as the double. The original purpose of the law was to guarantee a swift sentence. Many lawyers exploited the law by using pettifoggery to delay sentences, so that the prisoners would be benefited by it. The law was derogated in 2001. The law started a controversy in 2017. Luis Mui√±a was convicted of crimes committed during the 1970s Dirty War, when he was part of a group that kidnapped, tortured, and murdered victims in a torture camp that operated within a hospital. Mui√±a asked to have his sentence reduced because of this law. The Supreme Court of Argentina approved it: the law made no exception for the dirty war crimes, and although the law was no longer in force, case law required to apply the most benign law. This was controversial because it would set a case law that would benefit many other military convicted by similar crimes. Human rights organizations called for demonstrations against the ruling, which were massive. The Supreme Court reversed its ruling, and requested the Congress to sanction a law that sets a different system of prison release for those crimes than for other ones. The Congress soon followed suit.Novaro, pp. 27-28 Mui√±a returned to prison some days later. Rufino Batalla, another convicted military, had asked for a similar benefit when Mui√±a was benefited. The Court rejected this case in 2018, in light of the new law sanctioned by the Congress.

Guinness Book of World Records 1985. Sterling Publishing Co. To qualify, he had to pass a two-hour conversational fluency test with a native speaker of each of the 42 different languages he spoke at that time. Early life Powell Janulus was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He was exposed to many Slavic languages as a child. His Polish mother spoke six languages while his Lithuanian father spoke at least four. He could speak 13 languages fluently at the age of 18. He attended Asian Studies at the University of British Columbia where he attempted to learn Mandarin. In an interview, he stated that he struggled with the academic teaching style.Nikulicheva, D.B. (2009). How to Find your Way to Foreign Languages. Flinta. He became curious about the process of language learning and in the way that children learn languages so easily.Dilts, Robert (1998). Modeling with NLP. Meta Publications. Capitola, CA. He attempted to learn Chinese by having conversations and talking with as many Mandarin speakers as possible.Atkinson, Marilyn; and Paul Gossen (2015). Velocity Instant Fluency. Velocity Learning. During his early 20s, he began to develop his methodology for fast language acquisition. In his 30s, he became a court translator and got paid for each language he could translate. He worked to learn two or three languages per year, as each language allowed him to earn more at his job. He was authorized by the Provincial Court of British Columbia, as a court translator in 28 languages. He stated that he later became interested in language variations and could quickly learn related languages such as Spanish and Portuguese. In his 40s, he learned less common languages such as Tibetan, Romani, Inuit and Swahili. Later in life, he opened the Geneva Language Institute, a language school in Vancouver. World record holder for fluency In 1985, Powell was entered into the Guinness World Records for spoken fluency in 42 languages. To qualify, he had to pass a two-hour conversational fluency test with a native speaker of each language he spoke at that time. This testing took place over a one-month period. Powell stated that he considers himself skilled in 64 languages and said that he studied at least 80 languages in total. In an interview, Powell claimed that the late John Candy hired him to help him speak Punjabi for the movie Who's Harry Crumb?. He once appeared on The Tonight Show where talk show host Johnny Carson invited speakers of 48 different languages to test Janulus. It was reported that Powell speaks the following 42 languages: French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian, German, Dutch, Frisian, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Kashubian, Lusatian, Wendish, Belarusian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Armenian, Sinhalese, Tibetan, Japanese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Croatian, Greek, Turkish, Kurdish, Finnish, Korean and Persian. This list does not include English, which is his native language, or the many other languages in which he has some proficiency. Recent years Powell was reported to have died in 2006, however this was inaccurate. In an interview, he stated that his disappearance was due to a stroke he suffered at that time. He reported that he lost his ability to speak English, due to brain damage. He claimed to have regained his English spoken ability by speaking Dutch with a nurse. He is currently retired and living in White Rock, British Columbia. In August 2013, he was again the subject of a language testing event during which he spoke at least 20 languages and modeled the learning process with Korean and Tagalog.

It was issued for the 100th anniversary of the voyage of the ship Restauration, bringing early Norwegian immigrants to the United States. U.S. Representative from Minnesota Ole Juulson Kvale, a Norse-American, wanted a commemorative for the centennial celebrations of the Restauration journey. Rebuffed by the Treasury Department when he sought the issuance of a special coin, he instead settled for a medal. Sculpted by Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, the medals recognize those immigrants' Viking heritage, depicting a warrior of that culture on the obverse and his vessel on the reverse. The medals also recall the early Viking explorations of North America. Once authorized by Congress, they were produced in various metals and sizes, for the most part prior to the celebrations near Minneapolis in June 1925. Only 53 were issued in gold, and they are rare and valuable today; those struck in silver or bronze have appreciated much less in value. They are sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative coin series. Background and inception On July 4 or 5, 1825, the vessel Restauration sailed from Stavanger, Norway, for the United States, with 45 emigrants aboard. According to what The New York Times deemed \\"bacchanalian\\" legends of its passage, the expedition anchored off an English coastal village and traded ashore some of its rum, only to depart in haste when local officials took an interest. Off Madeira, expedition leader Lars Larsen is said to have fished a cask from the sea, which proved to be filled with rare wine that was thoroughly enjoyed by those aboard. After they arrived in New York on October 9, the ship was seized pursuant to a court order, as the passengers exceeded the permitted number for a ship of its size by 21, counting a baby girl born to the Larsens en route. In addition, a fine was to be imposed, but because the immigrants spoke no English and had no knowledge of American laws, President John Quincy Adams issued a pardon, releasing the ship and remitting the fine. Initially settling on land they purchased near the shore of Lake Ontario, about from Rochester, New York, the passengers were the first of many organized groups of Norse-Americans who crossed the Atlantic, especially to the northern and western United States. Ole Juulson Kvale was a Minnesota congressman of the Farmer-Labor Party, and a proud Norse-American. Kvale was a member of the Norse-American Centennial Commission, which was to organize a 100th anniversary celebration of the Restauration voyage. This celebration was important to a Norse-American community that had been perceived as antiwar during World War I, and was attempting to display both ethnic pride and assimilation. Kvale, a Lutheran minister, was also a member of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, and in January 1925 approached the Treasury Department, seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary; he was told that the Treasury would oppose it. Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups were unlikely to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar, seen by some as Protestant propaganda. On January 30, 1925, Kvale attended a meeting of the Coinage Committee, at which the proposal that would become the Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar was considered. Treasury officials were present in opposition, suggesting a medal be issued instead, and Kvale asked several questions about the Mint's issuance of medals. On February 3, Kvale and his son Paul met with Treasury officials, bringing a draft bill authorizing the Bureau of the Mint to strike commemorative medals for the Restauration anniversary. Acting Mint Director Mary M. O'Reilly and Treasury Undersecretary Garrard Winston were dubious about the idea of striking silver medals that would be between the quarter and half dollar in size. To offset this concern, Paul Kvale suggested making the medal octagonal or hexagonal. O'Reilly and Winston favored the idea, and after Congressman Kvale met with legal counsel to the Treasury and other officials, he was assured of the department's full support. Kvale also successfully lobbied the Post Office Department for the issuance of commemorative stamps; he told Third Assistant Postmaster General Warren I. Glover that, in a broader sense, the medal recognized the North American explorations of the Vikings around the year 1000. Kvale declared that in seeking the souvenir medal and stamps, he was contributing to the \\"growth of the Norwegian heritage by having it 'preserved in metal' as well as 'paper time capsules'.\\" Legislation Kvale introduced a bill for a Norse-American medal in the House of Representatives on February 4, 1925. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. On behalf of that committee, Kvale reported it favorably to the full House on February 10. In the report, Kvale stated that the 40,000 medals would be struck without expense to the government, and that Treasury officials supported the bill. \\"In view of the importance of this celebration to the many descendants of the Norse immigrants into this country, and through these to the State of Minnesota, which is officially sponsoring the event, and to the great Northwest, which they have been such a large factor in developing, the committee believes that such a medal is fitting and proper and that this bill should be enacted into law.\\" South Dakota Senator Peter Norbeck also introduced legislation for a Norse-American medal on February 5, 1925. It was referred to the Committee on the Library. On the 6th, that committee was discharged of responsibility for the bill and it was referred instead to the Committee on Banking and Currency. Norbeck, on behalf of the Banking Committee, reported the bill favorably and without amendment to the Senate on February 13. It was passed by the Senate without objection or amendment on the 18th. The Senate-passed bill then was transmitted to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, asked if there was objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted to know if there was anyone present who could give him information about it, and if there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925. The act provided for a maximum of 40,000 medals, to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint, from design models prepared by the Norse-American Centennial Commission. Medals would be turned over to a designated agent of the commission on payment of the cost of producing them. They were to be made subject to the provisions of section 52 of the Coinage Act of 1873. That section permitted medals of a national character to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint, but forbade Mint personnel from making dies for private medals,(third session) and was enacted after Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Franklin Peale had for some years run a private medals business on Mint premises, prior to his firing in 1854. Preparation Kvale hoped that his friend and fellow Minnesotan, Senator Henrik Shipstead, could persuade sculptor Gutzon Borglum to design the medal for no fee or a nominal one. Borglum, who was busy with construction at Stone Mountain in Georgia (he would later sculpt Mount Rushmore), had designed the Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar; he had no time to accept the work. Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, a member of the Commission of Fine Arts, was engaged for a fee of $1,500, about the usual for a commemorative coin. Fraser prepared designs and submitted them to the Mint; O'Reilly sent them to the Commission of Fine Arts on April 14, 1925. The commission approved them; its only suggestion was that the first \\"the\\" be removed from the inscription on the reverse, \\"AUTHORIZED BY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\", and this was done. Sketches had been printed in the Minneapolis Journal on March 29, provoking some reaction from those who felt that the design implied that Norwegians still dressed like Vikings in 1825, and that the date, 1000, should be moved from reverse to obverse to eliminate the confusion. The public objections had no effect on events. Design The obverse of the medal shows a Norwegian Viking chieftain who has just come ashore from his ship (seen behind him) and is armed for war, with horned helmet, shield, sword, and svard (dagger). He is intended to be landing at Vinland, the lands in the Americas explored and to some extent settled by the Vikings about the year 1000. The helmet is most likely an anachronism, as they are not believed to have been used for two millennia prior to the Vinland landing, and were probably ceremonial, rather than intended for battle. The centennial and the years are recognized on the obverse. The reverse shows a Viking ship, along with the authorization by Congress and the approximate year in which Vinland was settled. \\"OPUS FRASER\\" (Fraser's work), the artist's signature, is to the left of the ship. Numismatist Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, wonders if Leif Erikson, the famed explorer of that period, would not have been a superior choice. He concludes that Kvale would not have supported such a depiction, because \\"he was interested in pure romanticization. He saw a Viking ship and his chieftain in full regalia\\". Julie Shultz, in her journal article on the 1925 celebration, finds it significant that the medal has nothing to do with the arrival of the Restauration in an already-formed United States, but symbolizes ethnic pride in the early explorers. Noting that one of the stamps depicts a Viking ship and the other the Restauration, she concludes of these three government issues for the celebration: \\"Though outwardly, these souvenirs were to symbolize the Norwegian immigrant heritage that began in 1825, they actually invert the dominant narrative by using an American form to proclaim that Norwegians were the first Europeans to land on American soil.\\" Production, distribution, and collecting Six thousand silver medals on a thin (1.6 mm) planchet were struck between May 21 and 23, 1925, at the Philadelphia Mint. They were handled like ordinary coins: They were counted, bagged, and transported to the Fourth Street National Bank of Philadelphia for the centennial commission's use. Between May 29 and June 13, a total of 33,750 pieces were struck on a thick (2 mm) silver planchet. The reason for the two varieties is uncertain; Swiatek theorizes that the Norse-American Centennial Commission might not have liked how the thin ones looked, or might have wanted collectors to buy two medals. One hundred were struck in gold, on June 3 and 4‚ÄîKvale received the second one struck. The medals cost the commission 30 cents each for the thin ones, 45 cents for the thick, and $10.14 for the gold. The retail price of the thin ones is uncertain (Swiatek estimates $1.75), the thick ones are known to have cost $1.25, and the gold pieces about $20. They were sold by mail order; none were sold at the celebrations or in person. There was a sales limit of one per person, but purchasers could buy on behalf of as many family members as they wanted. The thin pieces were not offered for sale until November or December 1925, and sold mostly to numismatists‚Äîthe commission's secretary, J.A. Horvik, was frustrated that more \\"Norsemen\\" were not buying the medal. After the celebrations, Kvale took 5,000 medals to New York, hoping to sell them, but was not successful. Of the 100 gold pieces struck, 47 were eventually returned to the Treasury when they could not be sold, and some of the silver pieces (most likely thick ones) were as well. The Norse-American Immigration Centennial Celebration was held at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds near Minneapolis from June 6‚Äì9, 1925. Automobile caravans were organized to bring attendees from the Red River Valley, bearing the slogan, \\"The Norsemen are Coming!\\" President Coolidge was present; he called the Viking explorers \\"these sons of Thor and Odin\\", and told attendees, \\"the pledge of the Norwegian people has never yet gone unredeemed. I have every faith that through the vigorous performance of your duties you will add new lustre to your glories in the days to come.\\" The New York Times noted that commemorative stamps and a congressionally authorized medal had been issued for the celebration. \\"Seldom before has the celebration of a similar event been so honored by the Government, as has this centennial.\\" The Times had inaccurately described the medal as \\"the first commemorative medal to be issued in the history of the mint\\". The publicity people for the celebration had billed it as the first medal to be issued pursuant to an act of Congress, but in October 1925, Mint Director Robert J. Grant learned that a medal had been authorized by Congress for the centennial of American independence in 1876, and it had been issued in different sizes. He informed Kvale, who was intrigued by the fact that the independence medal had been issued in a 3-inch (76 mm) size. The congressman felt that the larger size would allow the detail of his medal to be better shown, which would help when one was exhibited in a museum display case. Not all members of his board were enthusiastic about the idea, but between 60 and 75 of these larger medals were struck, likely in December at the Philadelphia Mint, with Kvale undertaking to purchase any that were not sold. They were plated in silver by a private firm in Washington, D.C., and about 30 were presented or mailed to dignitaries, including one to President Coolidge. The Norse-American medal is not a coin, and is not legal tender. Due to its similarity to a coin, and the fact that it was authorized by Congress, it is sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative coin series. Though the silver ones can be purchased for less than $100 up to $500, and the silver-plated one for between $500 and $3,500, the gold specimen has sold for as high as $40,000. Some medals were used as pocket pieces or worn in mountings to the fair, and display damage or wear.

The book was released in paperback form by Heresy Press on July 7, 2014. According to the author, its title is meant to be ironic. Background and description Josh Sklar's Digital Doesn't Matter is a 562-page book that describes how digital content has become ubiquitous, and how the medium of delivery should not be treated as an obstacle for advertisers. Sklar and his former colleague John Lambie wrote the book as both an interactive and a conventional stand-alone work. Digital Doesn't Matter features a foreword by American advertising executive Jeff Goodby; additional contributors include Valerie Cheng, Jeff Cheong, Jon Cook, Steve Elrick, Andy Greenaway, Chris Kyme, Sean Lam, Ken Mandel, Craig Mapleston, Peter Moss, Jim Speelmon, and Joe Zandstra. It is the result of more than 1,200 transcribed pages from over 100 interviews with branding and marketing professionals. The book is split into four parts: \\"The Good Old Days\\", \\"Things Fall Apart\\", \\"Digital Takes Over\\", and \\"The Future of Advertising\\". The first part takes on a nostalgic tone and describes how chief executive officers and creative directors created their first websites in the 1990s. The second part focuses on work processes, advances and changes in the advertising industry, and how to \\"reboot\\" the agency process. The third gives advice on how to be successful in a digital world. The fourth part says that the current model is detrimental to the industry and recommends alternatives. Sklar has said of the book's concept, \\"It's about the transformation of traditional agencies and marketers and the fact that most agencies have been very slow about embracing it. There's been a lot of fear and a lot of confusion. So focus is about getting the insights of people from all over the world to portray the actual situation. What we found is agencies that had not turned to digital have not earned their clients' trust.\\" Funding Sklar and Lambie launched a Kickstarter campaign called \\"Digital Doesn't Matter: Reinventing the Advertising Industry\\" on January 21, 2013 to raise money to create an iPad app and to self-publish the book on Amazon.com in both digital and hardcover formats. In February 2013, Silicon Hills News reported that the duo were almost half-way to their $30,000 goal with 152 contributors and 24 days remaining. The campaign was ultimately successful, with 341 backers pledging $36,940. Reception Communication Arts called the book a \\"compendium of brutally honest, provocative insights that are, at times, pure heresy\\" and included it as \\"recommended reading\\" in their \\"Advertising Annual\\" for 2014. Note: Advertising Annual 2014. Laura Lorek of Silicon Hills News described the project as \\"a lasting platform that can be updated and changed with the focus on what went wrong with the advertising industry and ideas on how to fix it\\". Farah Siru of Marketing Magazine called the book \\"an ironic compilation of opinions and insights from some of the best admen in the business, presented in a linear storyline\\". Allein Moore of AdAsia compared Sklar's work in digital advertising to James Lee's (pseudonym for Jim Aitchison) work in television, print, and radio advertising. He wrote, \\"Bearing in mind the speed of development across the digital platforms, this book may not be relevant for too many years but right now, it is a 'must read' for both clients and agency people.\\" References External links * Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Non-fiction books about advertising ","title":"Digital Doesn't Matter"},{"id":"47711613","text":"Gnorimoschema albimarginella is a moth in the family Gelechiidae.

It is a Church of England parish church in the Parish of the Ascension of the Diocese of Ely, located on the junction of Castle Street and Chesterton Road. It was completed and consecrated by the Bishop of Ely in 1875, to replace an earlier church founded in 1092. The church, which added \\"with St Peter\\" to its appellation when the neighbouring St Peter's Church became redundant, is home to both an Anglican and a Romanian Orthodox congregation and is used as a venue for concerts and other events. It also serves as a main location of the Cambridge Churches Homeless Project. The war memorial in the churchyard, designed by Bodley and Hare and unveiled in 1920, is Grade II-listed. History =Foundation= St Giles' Church was founded in 1092 by an endowment from Hugolina de Gernon, the wife of Picot of Cambridge, baron of Bourn and county sheriff. According to the 12th century writings of Alfred of Beverley, Hugolina, who had been suffering from a long illness which the king's physician and other doctors had been unable to treat, had prayed to Saint Giles on her death bed promising to build a church in his honour if she were to recover, which she duly did. Picot reportedly constituted the church, after consulting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm, and the Bishop of Lincoln, Remigius de F√©camp, under the supervision of the Canon of Huntingdon and his own patronage against the curtain walls of his home at Cambridge Castle. Former county archaeologist Alison Taylor, however, speculates that, rather than founding a new priory, Picot placed an existing minster serving the area in control of the Norman Canons Regular, and that this was done for purely economic reasons. Late 16c. map depicting old St Giles' church (bottom left corner) situated below Cambridge Castle (uphill, to the north) and above Magdalene College (by riverside, to the south). The church was initially served by a group of six Augustinian canons, who remained at St Giles' for twenty years until after the death of Picot, when they were granted land in Chesterton by Pain Peverel upon which they established Barnwell Priory. The small St Giles' Church continued to operate over the following centuries but failed to develop due to its impoverished location outside the town walls in a densely inhabited area that was badly affected by the Black Death. Under Queen Elizabeth I, the rectory and advowson were granted to the Bishop of Ely in 1562. The church's register of baptisms begins in 1596, those of marriages and burials in 1607, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1620.BHO The city of Cambridge: Churches The land within the parish boundary of St Giles (about 1,370 acres) remained largely unenclosed until the beginning of the 19th century. Under the enclosure act of 1802, thirty-three acres went to the Vicar of St Giles, in compensation for the loss of small tithes, and 165 acres to the Bishop of Ely, as an \\"appropriator of the Rectory of St Giles\\", in compensation for great tithes. More than half the enclosed land went to the colleges, and remained largely as pasture until the 1870s.Philomena Guillebaud, The Enclosure of Cambridge St Giles: Cambridge University and the Parliamentary Act of 1802. =Reconstruction= The interior of the old church in 1874, showing the post-Reformation extension and box pews. The original structure of the medieval church became almost entirely obscured or pulled down by a large post-Reformation extension and the addition of box pews. Early in the 19th century the vicar, William Farish (third Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy) enlarged the accommodation from 100 to 600 seats. View of St Giles' from castle mound According to former county archaeologist Alison Taylor, the church was serving the impoverished and fast-growing community of the upper town, in the neighbourhood of the castle mound, and its shire hall (assize court) (1842) and prison, when a new building was planned, incorporating elements from the previous church.'The New Saint Giles', in A Brief History The new Victorian building, standing a little north of the one it replaced, was erected to the design of T. H. and F. Healey, architects, of Bradford. In the new church, the early 12th-century chancel arch of the older church was reset between the south aisle and the south chapel, and a late 12th-century doorway was reset between the north aisle and the vestry. The stone Carr Monument (early 17c.), commemorating Nicholas Carr, appointed the University's second Regius Professor of Geek in 1547, was reset in the south wall of the south chapel (the Lady Chapel).St Giles' Church A Brief History = Revival = The High Altar The church is constructed of brick with Doulton stone dressings and a Westmorland slate roof. Inside, at the High Altar, the original reredos can be glimpsed behind the current triptych. It shows the resurrection appearance of Christ to the apostles on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. The triptych was installed at the turn of the century (19th to 20th).Saint Giles' Church, \\"The Chancel\\" Historic England, recording St Giles' Grade II*-listed status, describes it as being \\"of outstanding quality by virtue of its collection of medieval and C18 survivals, together with C19 fittings by many of England's leading church decorators\\". The interior was decorated in the style favoured by the Oxford Revival, with Sir Charles Kempe and Sir Ninian Comper commissioned to provide much of the design work, and the church still houses works after Michelangelo and a copy of Chatsworth House version of the Adoration of the Magi by Paolo Veronese. Much of the wood carvings were supplied in the late 19th century by Bavarian wood-carvers from Oberammergau. The altar rails came from the English Church in Rotterdam. The eighteen stained glass windows of the nave by Robert Turnhill of Heaton, Butler and Bayne, arranged in chronological sequence, begin with Saint Clement of Rome and eight others, which were installed in 1888 on the south side, and end with Samuel Seabury, installed with eight others on the north side later.Sylvia Pick, The Nave Windows of St Giles, Cambridge, 2014 =Team ministry= The War Memorial The church is now part of a team ministry benefice, for St Giles with St Peter; St Luke the Evangelist (Victoria Road) and St Augustine's (Richmond Road).

Die Neue Zeitung (, abbreviated NZ) was a newspaper published in the American Occupation Zone of Germany after the Second World War. It was comparable to the daily newspaper Die Welt in the British Occupation Zone and was considered the most important newspaper in post-war Germany. History Die Neue Zeitung was first published on October 17, 1945 in MunichKurt Koszyk: Presse unter alliierter Besetzung. Pages 31-58 in Wilke: Mediengeschichte, page 38. Abdruck der Titelseite der Erstausgabe. and continued publication until January 30, 1955. The paper was initially published twice weekly, later increasing to six times a week. =Die Neue Zeitung as an American-controlled media outlet= The Information Control Division of the American Occupation Authority acted as publisher of the newspaper. Although the Division allowed German editors and journalists to write, it never gave up ultimate editorial control of the publication. This was made clear in the newspaper's title bar: \\"Die Neue Zeitung - An American newspaper for the German people.\\"Kurt Koszyk: Presse unter alliierter Besetzung. Pages 31-58 in Wilke: Mediengeschichte, page 39. Die Neue Zeitung was considered a means of political re-education for the German population by its American publishers. It was a high quality publication, but after 1949 could not keep up with competition amid the rapid re-growth of the newspaper industry in Germany. =Berlin edition= Starting in early 1947, the American Sector of Berlin had its own separate edition of the NZ. This Berlin edition made sense because in Berlin, the former German capital, the Allied Control Council had strong influence and the interests of the Soviet Union and United States were increasingly at odds. Publication of the NZ in Berlin was seen as necessary to prevent the Sovietization of the Germans there. The NZ in Berlin operated autonomously under the editorship of Marcel Fodor. The feature section of the Berlin NZ - the so-called Feuilleton, covering literature, art, and culture - was under the direction of Friedrich Luft, long known for his theater reviews in the RIAS (\\"Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor\\", the radio and TV broadcasting service in the American Sector of Berlin). Hans Schwab-Felisch was another prominent contributor to the Berlin edition's Feuilleton. Schwab-Felisch later worked at the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and became editor of Merkur, Germany's leading intellectual review. Other contributors to the Feuilleton included freelancers Will Grohmann (fine arts) and Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt (music). =Later developments and end of publication= Starting in June 1949 a Frankfurt edition of Die Neue Zeitung was established. In 1951, the Munich and Frankfurt editions were merged into a single Frankfurt edition. After September 1953, the Neue Zeitung appeared only in Berlin. In March 1955, the paper ceased operations entirely. Contributors The following are some of the contributors to Die Neue Zeitung. The author Erich K√§stner was senior editor of the feature section (Feuilleton). Robert Lembke, later a television personality, directed the section on domestic politics.

The word Kharkhuwa has found its use extensively in Assamese satirical ( but sometimes even in serious) pieces of writing and in common parlance to signify native and indigenous commoners of Assam, often referring to or addressing them in a derogatory manner but never being offensive in any way. In fact, this word is a privileged term, loved to be used by a person referring his or her own self with pride for being a native Assamese speaking commoner. Meaning The term Kharkhuwa is a composite word consisting of Khar (meaning alkali) and Khuwa ( meaning to eat or one who eats). Although Khar means alkali i.e. opposite to acid, in Assamese cuisine Kharhttp://sunitabhuyan.com/?p=2299 is also the name of a dish (which is probably unique to the Indian state of Assam) prepared from natural sources of alkali like unripe papaya, bheem kol (Botanical name : Musa bulbasiana ) etc. . Thus the literal meaning of the term Kharkhuwa is the one who eats khar . Grammatically, Kharkhuwa can be used both as noun and adjective. While using as an adjective, the word Asomiya ( i.e. Assamese) shall necessarily immediately follow. ( e.g. Kharkhuwa Asomiya). Historical Significance of the term Kharkhuwa: Using Alkali instead of Salt The genesis of the popular term kharkhowa in Assamese signifying native and indigenous commoners of Assam is due to the fact of extensive use of Alkaline dish of Khar by these people since medieval ages in its cuisine instead of salt because salt was very precious in Assam in those days. The supply of rock salt used to be coming from the Naga and Mishimi hill tribes of eastern territories who in turn collected it from the hills there. However frequent wars in the political fronts among royalty of Assamese and Naga territories almost regularly disturbed such supply leading to crisis of this commodity. Only influential people & aristocrats could afford to possess salt. The commoners had to be satisfied with home-made crude alkaline substances instead of salt. Thus derogatory use of the term Kharkhuwa can be attributed to these circumstances separating the commoners from the aristocrats of medieval Assam. A popular Assamese adage \\"lune... sune samaan\\" meaning Lun (Salt) and Sun (Gold) are equal also signified that salt used to be very costly and thus had to be substituted with Khar by majority people in the lower strata of economy. As time changed, the kingdoms and royalty, the aristocracy disappeared; abundant supply of salt from other sources of various regions arrived and became easily available to all. However, use of Khar in the Assamese cuisine becomes permanent and so thus the use of the term Kharkhuwa still persists signifying a characteristic food habit of native Assamese people. ‚ÄìScientific reason behind for use of Alkali Assam is land of hills and rivers its environment is very pleasant. But due to the high Humidity in the air the leaf of trees, vegetable etc won't dry easily and all become perished , produce acidic substance and mixed with soil . So whatever grow in the soil all have a higher level of acidity and in the process people become acidic easily whenever agricultural product we consumed , and to reduce or flush out the acidic substance from body, people of Assam frequently uses Alkali (Khar) and various types of alkali dishes (Kharor Aanjaa) traditionally from the ancient time or from time immemorial Use of the term Kharkhuwa to signify Assamese solidarity The privilege of being addressed as Kharkhuwa can be claimed, due its historical significance, by a descendant of people of medieval Assam, now a territory of India. Although at present, the fact whether one's forefathers were commoners or aristocrats of medieval Assam is something of less significance and often indistinguishable, the satirical use of the term Kharkhuwa addressing a fellow native Assamese or on oneself, equating oneself with rest of fellow Assamese natives, signifies an underlying sense solidarity which is not at all derogatory or offensive in any way. Technically, recent immigrants from rest of India or outside into the territory of Assam, whose forefathers actually did not have to survive in the times of ordeal of being content with Khar instead of salt, are not Kharkhuwa in its true sense.

It lies to the west of Paia and to the east of Kahului Airport. It is the home of the Maui Country Club. , the population was 461. History Japanese Laborers on Spreckelsville Plantation, Maui, oil on canvas painting by Joseph Dwight Strong, 1885 Spreckelsville was founded in 1878 as a company town by German-American businessman Claus Spreckels, who later founded the Spreckels Sugar Company. Spreckels already ran the most successful sugar refinery in California. He arrived in Maui in 1876 after the passage of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, which gave freer access to market for sugar exported to the United States. Spreckels initially opposed the treaty, fearing that low tariffs on sugar would be detrimental to his business. After its passage, he resolved to establish his own plantations instead. At the time, his rivals Henry Perrine Baldwin and Samuel Thomas Alexander were building the Hamakua ditch to irrigate their plantation in nearby Haliimaile. Spreckels intended to compete with them, but had neither any land nor any water rights. Spreckels was able to purchase and lease of land and became friends with Walter M. Gibson, adviser to King KalƒÅkaua. Together, they made arrangements where Spreckels would loan the king money and in return, he and Gibson would increase the Spreckels' land holdings. Furthermore, the king had the Hawaiian legislature grant use of royal lands in fee. The royal government initially denied Spreckels' request for water rights, but KalƒÅkaua dismissed his ministers and replaced them with others who would obey his orders. Spreckels then made a financial gift and loan to the government in return for water rights for 30 years. These political machinations on his behalf earned Spreckels the nicknames \\"the sugar king of Hawaii\\" and \\"His Royal Saccharinity\\". He was also granted the rights to the Hamakua ditch if Baldwin and Alexander could not complete it on schedule (they did). Sugar mill in Spreckelsville, 1890 Spreckels then incorporated the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company (HC&S;) with Hermann Schussler, chief engineer of California's Spring Valley Water Works, and others, which joined the \\"Big Five\\" to become one of the most powerful entities in Hawaii. The HC&S; built the \\"Haiku ditch\\" to deliver gallons ( liters) of water over daily to his plantation lands, crossing ravines several hundred feet deep, surpassing the Hamakua ditch in volume and scope. Other technological advancements included using electric lighting to allow the plant to operate deep into the night, construction of a sugar mill that was capable of processing of sugar per hour, and being the first plantation to use rail to transport sugarcane from the fields to the mill. The Haiku ditch, the Hamakua ditch, and the Lowrie ditch (built in 1900 for the plantation) are part of the East Maui Irrigation System, which has been recognized as a Historical Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. By 1892, Spreckelsville was the largest sugarcane plantation in the world, and employed thousands of immigrant farm laborers from Japan, Korea, China, and other countries, who often lived in squalid conditions. These camps no longer exist and the land they were on has been reclaimed for sugar crops. However, Spreckels began suffering setbacks after falling out of KalƒÅkaua's favor in 1886. Besides Alexander & Baldwin (A&B;), the HC&S; faced new competition from the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, which grew to become one of largest sugar refineries in the world. Other problems included deterioration of the Spreckelsville facilities and the annexation of Hawaii by the United States, which brought an end to contract laborers. A&B; then gained control of the HC&S; in 1898, forcing Spreckels out. Eventually, A&B; sold off the desirable coastal lands to real estate developers, and those houses and vacation rentals are the ones that now make up the community. Beaches Driftwood on Spreckelsville Beach Spreckelsville Beach is the historic name for approximately in length from Kanaha Beach Park on the west in Kahului to Maui Country Club on the east. The beach is not one continuous stretch of sand, but is broken up into sections by lava, boulders, and groins. The different sections of the beach are now known by separate names. From west to east, they are: * Camp One () is named after one of the sugarcane plantation camps and is located at the westernmost end of Spreckelsville Beach at the end of the Kahului Airport runway. As a result, the Federal Aviation Administration has banned kitesurfing in this location. It is also where a small number of Maui's homeless population lives. Beachgoers can reach Camp One via an access road off the western end of Stable Rd. * Sprecks Beach () is popular among European windsurfers, and as such is also known as Euro Beach. There is a small area where cars may be parked at the end of a dirt road leading from Stable Rd. * Lobster Cove () is only publicly accessible by foot from Sprecks Beach or Sugar Cove. * Sugar Cove () is fronted by private condominiums, but there is a public access path with limited parking at the end of Paani Place. * Baby Beach () was an ancient Hawaiian burial site. It is separated from the rest of Spreckelsville Beach by shoreline features and thus is generally now considered to be distinct from it. In fact, it is the western end of a one- mile (1.6 km) portion of beach that stretches to Baldwin Beach Park in Paia. An exposed reef creates a lagoon that makes the beach popular with families. It is served by a parking area at the end of Kealaka Place.

The film illustrates Ull√≥n's relationship with her ageing mother, who suffers from epilepsy and Parkinson's disease, and the conflicts she faces when she needs to take care of her while living away. It was selected as the Paraguayan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards and Goya Awards. The documentary is a co-production between Switzerland, where the director resides, and Paraguay. Plot Since Arami can remember, her mother suffers from epilepsy and Parkinson's. Her parents were separated, so Arami was left alone with a mother who had seizures that she remembers as terrifying. At a very young age, she was to care for herself and her mother. Now as an adult, Ull√≥n has been living in Switzerland with her partner Patrick. Despite the distance, she maintained contact with her mother, and has been supervising her care. Arami's mother, Mirna, continues to live in Paraguay with Julia, a caregiver without adequate preparation for the task, who takes care of her throughout the day in exchange for a modest salary. The conflict begins with her mother's health deteriorating and Julia announcing she can no longer cope with the situation, wanting to quit her job. Since no one except Arami can take care of her mother, she must return to Paraguay. Arami starts a difficult journey trying to find adequate care for her mother, that develop in a series of practical and emotional challenges. Reception The documentary premiered at the Vision du Reel International Festival, on April 2014, where Cloudy Times won the prize for Best First Feature. The film has been shown in more than 70 Film Festivals, and commercially, the movie has been shown in at least ten cities in Switzerland, and three Paraguayan cities. It is available online for streaming under the names Cloudy Times and Storms of the Heart. Cloudy times has been selected by the Paraguayan Film Academy to be submitted for the Academy Awards, becoming the first Oscar submission for the country. The film caused debate in Paraguay by exposing a harsh reality for the sick and elder: There is a lack of public services, and relatives find themselves with no resources. As a reaction to the documentary, a map with municipal free services for the elderly has been created. Reviews * \\"Arami Ull√≥n's El Tiempo Nublado (Cloudy Times)...demonstrates a keen awareness of the sensitivities involved in recording the life of a vulnerable person. Ull√≥n deftly sidesteps the pitfalls ... a task complicated further by the intensely personal nature of the film\\". Dr. Catherine Leen * \\"Powerful, intimate and uncomfortably voyeuristic\\". Jonathan Holland * \\"A supremely personal film set in part in a distant land, ‚ÄúEl tiempo nublado‚Äù still turns on an issue which will be instantly ‚Äì and movingly familiar ‚Äì to film viewers around the world: How to care for one‚Äôs parents once they are old and ill.\\" John Hopewell * \\"El tiempo nublado is a kind of psychotherapy achieved through images, which nevertheless has the incredibly admirable quality of never falling into the trap of navel-gazing, instead regaling us, in a very genuine way, with an unexpected and reinvigorating emotional universality, a collective catharsis that makes the film one of a kind, halfway between a documentary and an intimate portrait...

Details \\"Sweet Lady\\" is a distortion-driven fast rocker written by May. The song is an unusual rock style in 3/4 meter (which gives way to 4/4 at the bridge). According to an online source, Roger Taylor once said that because of its unusual time signature, \\"Sweet Lady\\" was the hardest song for him to play live on the drums.http://www.queenlive.ca/queen/75-11-14.htm The backing track was probably recorded live, as one can hear the wires on the snare drum of Taylor's kit vibrating along with John Deacon's bass guitar riff. Comments Live performances \\"Sweet Lady\\" was first performed live on the A Night at the Opera Tour in November 1975. It was one of only three songs from the soon to be released album (A Night At The Opera) to be performed live (the others being \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"The Prophet's Song\\"). The band were still completing the album a week before it was to be released, so they only had a couple of days to rehearse. The song would remain on Queen's live set to its last performance in June 1977. Like many Queen tracks performed live, the song has never been released on an official live album. Legacy The song's line \\"You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese\\" was mentioned in the 2018 Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody during an argument between Taylor (Ben Hardy) and May (Gwilym Lee) about I'm in Love with My Car, wherein Taylor asks May about the song's content, gets the lyrics, and reads \\"You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese\\". The line, along with the scene's other lines \\"It's a metaphor Brian.\\", \\"It's a bit weird Roger. What exactly are you doing with that car?\\", \\"Roger, there's only room in this band for one hysterical queen.\\", and \\"Not the coffee machine!\\", are considered to be some of the most popular lines in film.

The group consists of seven members: singers and instrumentalists playing mainly brass instruments. According to KCNA, the band members are instrumentalists of the Wangjaesan Art Troupe and singers of the Moranbong Band's chorus. The Chongbong Band was formed in late July 2015. The creation of the band has been attributed to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The Chongbong Band's appearance at the time that another pop group, the Moranbong Band, disappeared sparked rumors about it being a replacement for the latter. However, the Moranbong Band reappeared on 7 September 2015, a week after the Chongbong Band made its public debut in Moscow, Russia. History =Creation= The group was formed on 28 July 2015. Its creation has been attributed to Kim Jong-un. Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, was also involved in its creation. Chongbong Band, much like Moranbong Band also attributed to Kim Jong-un, was created to produce \\"music 'for the people. According to South Korean media and Radio Free Asia, Chongbong Band replaced Moranbong Band whose former members disappeared from the public. Some of them reportedly left the band to get married and others were deported out of the country. Moranbong band, however, returned on 7 September 2015 to perform in a concert attended by Kim Jong-un. =Debut= In August‚ÄìSeptember 2015, the band performed with the State Merited Chorus in two concerts in Moscow, Russia: at the on 31 August and at the Moskvich Cultural Center on 1 September. The performances in Russia were the band's public debut. The choice of venue in Russia has been interpreted as a signal of hopes of strengthening economic ties between North Korea and Russia. =Other performances= On 11 October 2015, the band performed in the people's theater, Pyongyang on the occasion of the 70th birthday of the Workers' Party of Korea. On the 19th of the same month, the Chongbong Band performed the same concert in front of Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju. Also attending the concert were members and directors from the Moranbong Band, members of the State Merited Chorus, other artistes and people from Pyongyang.

The film stars McGregor, Jennifer Connelly, Dakota Fanning, Peter Riegert, Rupert Evans, Uzo Aduba, Molly Parker and David Strathairn. Principal photography began on September 21, 2015, in Pittsburgh. The film had its world premiere on September 9, 2016, at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival and was theatrically released in the United States on October 21, 2016, by Lionsgate to negative reviews. Plot In 1996, at the 45th-year reunion of the class of '51 at Weequahic High School in Newark, New Jersey, writer Nathan Zuckerman meets one of his old friends, Jerry Levov. They talk about Jerry's older brother, former all-state star athlete Seymour (\\"Swede\\"), class of '44, who recently died after a long illness. The story moves back to a young Swede persuading his father, glovemaking magnate Lou Levov, to let him marry his high school sweetheart, New Jersey's 1947 Miss America contestant Dawn Dwyer. Lou is skeptical because Swede is Jewish and Dawn is a devout Roman Catholic, but her strength and honesty sways him. They have a daughter, Meredith (\\"Merry\\"), and settle in the town of Old Rimrock, where they acquire a large farm, with Swede commuting the 30 miles to the Newark glove factory. Smart and quirky Merry struggles with a stuttering problem, and is deeply affected as a 12-year-old by the self- immolation of Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c in 1963. By the time Merry reaches high school, she has become increasingly radicalized as the Vietnam War rages, and frequently goes to New York City to take part in antiwar protests. When Merry lashes out during the 1967 Newark riots, Swede urges her to channel her energy into protesting against the war from closer to home. A few days later, the town's little post office and store is destroyed by a bomb, killing the owner. Merry disappears, and is the FBI's prime suspect, though Swede and Dawn believe she is innocent or, if involved, being forced to act by older radicals she met in New York. After Swede unsuccessfully hounds the FBI for information on Merry's whereabouts, 22-year-old university student Rita Cohen visits the factory, ostensibly working on a report for business class. Rita tips off Swede with credible information about Merry, hints that she knows Merry's whereabouts, then asks him to meet her at a hotel with $10,000 cash. Swede meets Rita in the hotel room, but spurns her mean-spirited attempts to seduce him. Rita runs off with the money and leaves no further information regarding Merry. The strain of Merry's disappearance eventually causes Dawn to have a nervous breakdown. After treatment, Dawn starts an affair with a neighbour, tells Swede that Merry has destroyed their former life, and tries to get Swede to forget about Merry so that they can start a new life. In 1970, Swede spots Rita on a New York City street. Rita takes him to a skid-row area of Newark where Merry now lives. During two brief visits, Merry confesses to Swede that she made and planted a total of 3 bombs, killing 4 people. She tells of how she later slid into the underground, where she was robbed and raped repeatedly. As a penance for her crimes, she has withdrawn from society, and is practicing extreme asceticism within the Indian religion Jainism, though the quietness of her physically dirty and simple life style has ended her stutter. She has no desire to return home, and says that if he loves her, he will let her be. Years pass as Swede returns occasionally to stand outside the abandoned house where he last found Merry without ever seeing her again. In the present, at Swede's funeral, Nathan muses that we know we are alive when we realize that \\"all the time... we are wrong\\" about our assumptions \\"about everyone\\". As the mourners are leaving, a cleaned up middle-aged Merry arrives, silently passing her uncle and mother as she walks to Swede's grave.

The site's critical consensus reads, \\"American Pastoral finds debuting director Ewan McGregor's reach exceeding its grasp with a well-intentioned Philip Roth adaptation that retains the form, but little of the function, of its source material.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score 43 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

Highway 7 at the junction of County Road 118 (LuoMa Highway) in Luofu, Taoyuan Highway 7 at the junction of Highway 7a in Qilan, Yilan County Route description The highway begins at the junction of Highway 3 in Daxi. The route then passes through Cihu Mausoleum, the tombs of the late presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-Kuo. After the intersection with Highway 7B, the route enters the aboriginal district of Fuxing in Taoyuan City. At Luofu village (ÁæÖÊµÆ, Rahao) in Fuxing, the highway passes through the intersection with County Road 118, a popular scenic route also known as LuoMa Highway (ÁæÖÈ¶¨ÂÖ¨Ë∑Ø). Starting from Fuxing, the road becomes a narrow and winding 1-lane highway as it crosses the Central Mountain Range. The highway passes through numerous tribal villages along the way. The highway then enters Datong, Yilan, also an aboriginal township. At Datong the highway passes through Mingchi Forest Recreational Area (ÊòéÊ±†ÂúãÂÆ∂Ê£ÆÊûóÈÅäÊ®ÇÂçÄ) and Qilan Forest Recreational Area (Ê£≤Ëò≠ÂúãÂÆ∂Ê£ÆÊûóÈÅäÊ®ÇÂçÄ). The highway has a junction with Highway 7a in Qilan area and another with Highway 7c near Yingshi village (Ëã±Â£´Êùë), both located in Datong. The highway then follows Lanyang River and continues to Yuanshan, Yilan and Yilan City. At Yilan City the highway intersects with PH 9 and Freeway 5 before ending at PH 2 in Zhuangwei.

Life Evenius was born in Nauen, a mid-sized town a short distance to the west of Potsdam and Berlin. His father was a clothier/weaver. On 23 April 1602 Sigismund Evenius commenced his studies at Leucorea (subsequently part of Wittemberg University). In due course he emerged with a Magister qualification, and in 1611 he obtained a position in the Philosophy faculty. Shortly after this, in 1613, he relocated to Halle, becoming the rector of the Gymnasium (school). During his time in Halle he came into contact with the education reformer Wolfgang Ratke, on whose ideas he seized. In 1618 he visited K√∂then in order to see the implementation of Ratke's ideas at first hand. It is evident that Evenius was so enthused by Ratke's ideas that he began teaching, primarily religion, at according to Ratke's Christian school precepts, using the vernacular (rather than Latin), despite personal differences between the two of them. He also put together a plan to create a \\"German Arts School\\", which would promote practical awareness with hands-on craftsmanship activities. His parting contribution, when he left Halle in 1622, was a speech entitled \\"De contemtu scholarum scholasticique ordinis\\".One normally reliable source, the Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB - as currently transcribed by wikisource), states that it was to Riga in Estonia that he fled, and here that he took on the school headship. However, most sources give his Baltic destination as Reval, which is the old name for Tallinn. Also Riga is in Latvia, not Estonia, which supports the view that on this occasion the ADB as currently transcribed by wikisource is in error. While in Halle Evenius produced a work in which he addressed the doctrine of the Eucharist, which set him against, in particular, the Jesuits and the Protestant reformed churches. Notwithstanding his essential humanism, his basic commitment to the tenets of Lutheranism is apparent across his writing. With his appointment later the same year as rector of the Gymnasium in Magdeburg he gave another speech entitled \\"De vindicando huiusmodi contemtu\\". It is evident from these and from his subsequent writings and activities that he was fully engaged in the passionate sectarian disputes which were erupting across much of western Europe at the time. His progressive approach to schooling continued in Magdeburg where initial teaching took place in the students' mother tongue, and instruction in other languages following one by one, extending only later to the classics. Religious instruction was an important segment of the overall curriculum but it did not, at this stage, provide the context for the entire curriculum, as it would come to do during the 1630s. It is apparent from his subsequently published writings that he was also deeply concerned for the moral condition of the young men sent to him to be educated. Magdeburg was besieged and then destroyed by Catholic armies under Tilly and others in 1630/1631. Historians sometimes contend that the Thirty Years' War was the most destructive event in Europe prior to the twentieth century: the massacre in Magdeburg that followed the surrender of the city may have involved the death of perhaps 20,000 inhabitants.Hans Medick and Pamela Selwyn. Historical Event and Contemporary Experience: The Capture and Destruction of Magdeburg in 1631. History Workshop Journal, No. 52 (Autumn 2001), pp. 23-48. Oxford University Press, 2001. Military destruction was followed, as so often, by plague. Evenius fled with his family to Tallinn where he took over the headship of the newly founded Gymnasium (school). He returned to Germany less than a year later, however. In 1633 he took charge of the Gymnasium (school) in Regensburg. Evenius had been much affected by the destruction of Magdeburg and his writings, which from now on were published in German rather than Latin, disclose the (then widely held) belief that his former home-city's fate had been some sort of a judgement, reflecting God's anger over he conduct of citizens. In 1634 he was summoned to Weimar, accepting an appointment from The future Duke as Schools Advisor (Kirchen- und Schulrat). Duke Ernest I would gain a reputation as a practical champion for Lutheranism and an educational pioneer: Sigismund Evenius took part in setting up and expanding a new style of school system, and he also produced the widely distributed (German language) \\"Ernestine Bible\\". Evenius believed that the destructive consequences of the Thirty Years' War must be addressed by improvements in education, and although he himself died in 1639, he lived long enough to help create a firm basis for some of those improvements. After his death his influence was if anything more apparent than earlier, as a result of the education reforms successfully enacted by Duke Ernest, the practical extent of whose own authority would be extended through the timely death of an elder brother.

She performed four voyages for the British East India Company (EIC). On her fourth voyage the French captured her in the Action of 3 July 1810; she then took part in the Battle of Grand Port. The British recaptured her at the invasion of √éle de France (now Mauritius). She completed her fourth voyage and her owners then sold her. She became a transport until her owners sold her in 1815 to new foreign owners.  Career  =EIC Voyage #1 (1803-04)= Captain Thomas Hudson left The Downs on 27 April 1803, bound for Bombay, Bengal, and Madras. He sailed under a letter of marque issued on 27 June 1803, i.e., after he had left. Ceylon reached Bombay on 24 August, Tellicherry on 27 September, and Anjengo on 5 October, before arriving at Diamond Harbour on 18 November. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 24 December, Vizagapatam on 27 January 1804, Madras on 21 February, and St Helena on 28 June. Ceylon travelled from St Helena in convoy with the East Indiamen City of London, , Calcutta, and Wyndham, two vessels from the South Seas, Lively and Vulture, and , which had transported convicts to New South Wales. Their escort was .The Times, 12 October 1804. On the way the convoy ran into severe weather with the result that Prince of Wales foundered with the loss of all on board. Ceylon arrived at Northfleet on 15 October. =EIC Voyage #2 (1805-06)= Captain Thomas Hudson left Portsmouth on 8 March 1805, again bound for Madras, Bengal and Bombay.Ceylon arrived at Madras on 17 July, and reached Diamond Harbour on 10 August. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 7 November, Colombo on 20 December, Bombay on 19 January 1806, Tellicherry on 3 March, Quilon on 5 March, and Anjengo on 9 March. She reached St Helena on 14 May and arrived at Long reach on 22 July. =EIC Voyage #3 (1807-09)= Captain Thomas Hudson left Portsmouth on 4 March 1807, bound for Madras, Bengal, and Penang. Ceylon reached Madras on 9 September and Diamond Harbour on 3 October. She was at Saugor on 22 November and arrived at Penang on 15 December. She was again at Saugor on 8 February 1808, and at Kidderpore on 30 March. She was at Saugor again on 11 May, but now homeward bound, she reached Madras on 25 July. In November Ceylon was in convoy with some eight other Indiamen when she got caught in a hurricane. On this voyage, she had lost 46 men of the 110 she had set out with: 41 pressed by various ships of the Royal Navy, six dead of disease, six deserted, two drowned in Diamond Harbour, and one who had joined the Army. Hudson, who by this time knew he was dying of \\"Bengal Fever\\", had made up his numbers with lascars, and some Danes, however the replacements were of a lower quality than the men lost, especially those the Navy had pressed. On 21 November Ceylon was on her beam ends, almost capsizing; fortunately the weather temporarily moderated and she righted herself. As the weather worsened again, the foretopmast broke, but could not be cleared. Ceylon started to take on water and the pumps could not keep up. When Hudson went below, he found that the lascars and Danes were paralyzed by fear or fatalism and would not man the pumps. The men passengers, Army officers and invalided soldiers, manned the pumps while the functioning crew members threw guns overboard. Towards 6p.m. on 23 November the weather moderated and Ceylons pumps were able to start reducing the water in the ship. At some point that evening one of the passengers, the wife of an army officer, gave birth. As Ceylon limped towards Cape Town a fever passed through the vessel killing a baby born on 11 November, five soldiers, and three crewmen. Ceylon reached the Cape on 19 January 1809. There two of her passengers married. She arrived at St Helena on 7 March. On 17 March, a few days after leaving St Helena, Hudson died while Ceylon was at sea.Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Part 1 (June 1809), p.579. She arrived at the Downs on 19 May. =EIC Voyage #4 (1810-11)= Captain Henry Meriton left Portsmouth on 14 March 1810, bound for Madras and Bengal. Ceylon left the Cape on 13 June. He too sailed under a letter of marque, his being issued on 27 January 1810. In July, she was sailing off Comoros Islands in company with Windham and Astell. The convoy encountered a French frigate squadron under Guy-Victor Duperr√©, leading to the Action of 3 July 1810, where Minerve captured her. The French also captured Windham, while Astell managed to escape. The EIC put a value of ¬£15,995 on its cargo aboard Ceylon.Reports from the Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to enquire into the present state of the affairs of the East India Company, together with the minutes of evidence, an appendix of documents, and a general index, (1830), Vol. 2, p.977. Lieutenant Vincent Moulac took command of Ceylon, renamed Ceylan, and the frigate squadron returned to √éle de France with its prizes. Arriving, the squadron met with a British frigate squadron, leading to the Battle of Grand Port, where the British briefly recaptured Windham before the French retook her; Ceylan helped support the French squadron, which destroyed three of the British frigates, the last one surrendering when a second French frigate squadron come as reinforcements cut off the British frigate's retreat. From September 1810, her captors used Ceylon as a prison ship. The British recaptured her on 3 December in the invasion of Isle de France.Lloyd's List, 15 February 1811 - accessed 23 November 2013 After the British recaptured her, they sent her on her voyage. At this point she came under the command of John Stewart. Ceylon left Port Louis on 4 April 1811. She reached St Helena on 21 May, and arrived at The Downs on 8 August. Fate On her return to Britain in 1811, her owners sold her. Her new owners used her as a transport until 1815. Ceylon enters the Register of Shipping for 1813 in the supplemental pages with Morse, master, and Carling & Co. as owner. Her trade was London-based transport.Register of Shipping (1813). The Register of Shipping for 1815 lists her master as Hall. The other information is unchanged. Carling & Co.then sold her to foreign buyers and cancelled her registration on 18 September 1815.

Chippington has represented Great Britain at five consecutive Summer Paralympics, 1988 Seoul, 1992 Barcelona, 1996 Atlanta, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004. Competing as a S6 classification swimmer she favoured mainly 50 m and 100m freestyle competitions. After retiring from swimming Chippington returned to disability sport, becoming a world class paracanoeist, winning medals at the 2016 Summer Paralympics and ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships between 2012 and 2017. Personal history Chippington was born Jeanette Clare Esling in 1970 in Taplow, England. In 1982 she contracted a virus which resulted in damage to her spinal cord which in turn left her paralysed in both legs. She married in 1998, flying from her honeymoon to compete in the IPC Swimming World Championships in New Zealand. She has two children and also works as a swimming instructor and coach. Swimming career Chippington started swimming on the recommendation of her physiotherapist after her illness. She entered her first major competition in 1985 and despite originally participating in all four major competitive strokes, she settled as a 50m and 100m freestyle specialist. In 1988 she made the Great Britain team for the Summer Paralympics in Seoul entering the women's 100m backstroke and freestyle L4 events. There she finished in second place in the 100m freestyle to win her first Paralympic medal. Chippington represented Great Britain four years later at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. There she entered six events, taking a medal in one, a bronze in the women's Women's 4x50 m Medley S1-6, alongside team mates Tara Flood, Margaret McEleny and Jane Stidever. The 1996 Summer Paralympics were Chippington's most successful with a five medal haul. She won two gold medals, setting world records in both. In the Women's 4 x 100-metre medley relay she was reunited with McEleny and Stidver while new member Jennifer Booth was added to the last leg. The team finished in a time of 2:52.36 setting a new world record and taking gold. Her second gold medal was in the 100m freestyle S6. In the heats Jenny Newstead of New Zealand finished as fastest qualifier in a world record time of 1:23.85, while Chippington qualified third. Despite the strong competition, Chippington won the final by swimming 1:23:63 beating Newstead's short lived record in the process. She completed the Atlanta games with a silver in the 50 m freestyle S6 and two bronze medals in the 200 m freestyle S6 and 4x50 m medley relay S1-6. The 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney saw Chippington add another four Paralympic medals to her tally; a silver in the Women's 4 √ó 100 m medley relay 34 pts and three further bronze medals. Her final Paralympics as a swimmer was the 2004 Games in Athens. Despite believing she was not good enough to qualify for the Games, Chippington still left with another medal, a bronze in the 4x50m freestyle relay 20pts. Paracanoeing career Chippington took up paracanoeing after being nagged by a friend to try out the sport. In 2013, she won three gold medals at the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in Duisburg, but later decided to focus on the KL1 200m event when it was announced that only Kayaks in her disability classification would be included in the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. At the 2015 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships held in Milan, Chippington won gold in the KL1 200m, giving her a qualifying place for the 2016 Games in Rio. Chippington was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to canoeing.

He was renowned for leading 180 communists to launch a guerrilla assault on a police station during the Bukit Kepong Incident, causing deaths of almost all police officers in the station. Following the guerilla attack, the ruling British authorities placed a M$ 75,000 bounty on his head. On the night of 14 October 1952, Mat Indera was invited to a \\"meeting\\" by some acquaintances in Kampung Seri Medan, at which he was served tempeh and coffee laced with Datura. After being incapacitated, he was handed over to the British, who charged him with crimes related to the Bukit Kepong incident. Mat Indera was subsequently found guilty and hanged at 11 pm on 30 January 1953 in Taiping Prison.There was another version of Mat Indera which discovered a different motive when he joined the communist guerilla attack.

It lies just to the east of the roundabout where Elizabeth Way and Newmarket Road meet. The house is 17th- century but perhaps containing parts of earlier date; it has two storeys with attics. The house is a Grade II listed building; the walls and archway are separately listed Grade II. It has been described as both the oldest inhabited house and the most haunted house in the city. History Abbey House was built by Alexander Butler on the site of Barnwell Priory (dissolved 1539) and parts of the old ecclesiastical buildings can be found in the walls, cellar and gardens of the house. Local barrister Jacob Butler inherited the house and much of the surrounding land, which played host to the annual Stourbridge Fair, in 1714, but lost it in a legal dispute prior to his death in 1765. His tall fierce-looking ghost and that of his dog Wolfie have been reportedly sighted in his old home. The house's reputation for being haunted came to local prominence during the occupancy of Prof. J. C. Lawson of Pembroke College from 1904 to 1910, on the family's first night in residence members of the household were reportedly woken at midnight by a crashing sound, and from 1907 onward, Lawson and others reported seeing the ghost of a nun wrapped in a dark robe, who failed to respond to questioning but stood at the foot of Mrs Lawson's bed sighing during a protracted illness, while children of another family resident in the house at that time reportedly received regular visitations from this nun, who they did not like very much. A local woman, who lived in the northern end of the house from 1904 to 1911, later reported that she had heard stories of the Grey Lady prior to her residency. According to these local legends the house was haunted by the spirit of a nun from nearby St Radegund's Priory who used an underground passage, marked by a bricked up archway in the house's cellar, to meet with a canon at Barnwell Priory who was her secret lover. According to some versions of the legend, the nun was walled up by her fellow nuns as punishment for her indiscretion. The Lawsons and others also reported seeing ghostly animals in the house's gardens, including a well-fed red squirrel, which vanished when approached, and a large hare, which sat watching witnesses before disappearing. In the 1920s, reports of Mrs Ascham, wife of the owner, repeatedly seeing a disembodied female head at the foot of her bed reached Prof. F. J. M. Stratton of Gonville and Caius College, later President of the Society for Psychical Research, who rented the house for a month and reported muttering and singing coming from an empty room. Urban Huttleston Broughton, 1st Baron Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey gifted the house to the people of Cambridge at the end of World War II in celebration of the cessation of hostilities. The house was subsequently rented by the Cambridge & County Folk Museum until 1973 and a series of private tenants, including Mr Young and his daughter, who reported strange noises which caused their dog to cower in the corner of the room in the early 1960s, and Prof. Peter Danckwerts of Pembroke College, who researched the history of the house. There were further reported sightings of the Grey Lady up until 1986, around which time the house was exorcised by three clergymen. In 2002, following the death of the last leaseholder the previous year, the council put the house on the market for ¬£700,000 and sold it to the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, who as part of the contract agreed to open the house to the public.

He is a son of Alexander Men. Michael Men Project The Michael Men Project was an album project overseen by professional musician and then Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Mikhail Men (a.k.a. Michael Men). For the project Men acquired the services of veteran rock vocalists Glenn Hughes (formerly of Deep Purple, Trapeze and Black Sabbath) and Joe Lynn Turner (formerly of Rainbow). The project released a single album entitled Made In Moscow. Men had first met both Hughes and Turner when the pair performed in Russia with the Hughes Turner Project. In 2004 he invited them to take part in the recording of a hard-rock album he was putting together and in September of that year the pair went to Moscow to write and record with Men. Along with Hughes and Turner the album featured several native musicians. The majority of the album had been written in the 80s by Men and both Hughes and Turner contributed the lyrics and shared the vocals in a similar fashion to their Hughes Turner Project albums. The album, entitled Made In Moscow (a reference to the Deep Purple live albums Made in Japan and Made in Europe) was released in July 2005 on Inna Records in Russia.

The series director, Johan Renck, said of both the artist and the song; \\"The piece of music he laid before us embodied every aspect of our characters and the series itself: dark, brooding, beautiful and sentimental (in the best possible incarnation of this word).

Rolling Stone magazine's Daniel Krep said that the tune reminded him \\"of the bleak, haunting instrumentals on the back half of Bowie's 1977 album \\"Heroes\\"\\", and The Guardian suggested the song revealed Bowie 'at his most brooding.' The series is soundtracked by Warp Records artist Clark. It is his debut TV score and director Johan Renck said \\"Chris's sensibilities and brazen creativity was bang on for a score to deal with everything from the Biblical grandeur of the story, via brooding darkness all the way over to tender sentimentality.

He was also involved in the development of the White Pass wagon road during the Klondike Gold Rush. Early life and career Brackett was born in Calais, Maine to Henry H. Brackett and Mary S. Prescott. He attended the local schools and at the age of 20 decided to move west, eventually settling in St. Anthony, Minnesota (along with his acquaintance and fellow Mainer William D. Washburn). He found work with a butcher and eventually ran his own meat company. During the Dakota War of 1862 he received the contract to supply beef to Minnesotan troops. After a unit he was traveling with was attacked he was separated from them and forced to travel alone for five days to reconnect with them. After the war, Brackett moved into the city's rapidly growing milling industry and worked in partnership with William W. Eastman, William S. Judd and Willam D. Washburn. In 1869 he was contracted by J. Gregory Smith to supply and organize transportation for a scouting expedition for the Northern Pacific Railroad. He supported a second expedition in 1870 which built the railroad's first segment from Carlton, Minnesota to Fargo, North Dakota. For the next decade Brackett had a successful career as a contractor for railroad construction. In addition to the Northern Pacific he also performed work for the Great Northern Railway (U.S.) and the Canadian Pacific Railway. He also continued to remain active in a variety of other industries including meat packing, milling, construction and real estate. The 1888 Minneapolis City Directory noted his name and occupation as \\"George Brackett, Capitalist.\\" Brackett became involved in the politics of Minneapolis from its inception: he served as one of the city's first aldermen when the city was formed. In 1873 he was elected mayor of Minneapolis and served a single one-year term. He unsuccessfully ran for re- election in 1874 and 1876. By one account Brackett led such an extensive campaign against vice in the city that \\"the city was unable to live up to its opportunities thus offered\\" and opted to elect a less passionate mayor. He also served as the chief of the Minneapolis Fire Department for a number of years as well as on the Minneapolis Park Board where he was instrumental in purchasing and preserving Minnehaha Park. Brackett was also a major force behind some of the early city's civic events including the 1886 Industrial Exposition, the 1891 Harvest Festival, and the 1892 Republican National Convention. During the late 1880s and 1890s, Brackett faced a number of personal and financial setbacks. A building he owned in Minneapolis collapsed during a remodeling project, killing 4 workers and costing Brackett a significant amount of money to rehabilitate. A vacation home of his on Lake Minnetonka was destroyed by a tornado. In 1890 his wife Anna died. The downturn of the Panic of 1893 also drained his finances and forced him to turn to personal loans and mortgaging his properties to remain afloat. By 1897 he had left his various business interests and was semi-retired. White Pass wagon road In August 1897, Brackett left for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with his son James to explore the business of supplying prospectors involved in the Yukon Gold Rush. En route he met Joseph H. Acklen, a lawyer and former congressman, who expressed an interest in developing a reliable road from either Skagway or Dyea into the Yukon Territory. The two were later joined by engineer Norman Smith and formed the Skagway and Yukon Transportation and Improvement Company, backed by a small group of investors and shareholders. The group opted to use the White Pass leading from Skagway and named Brackett the general superintendent. Construction began in November 1897. While Brackett begun work, the company backing the project faced turmoil from in-fighting and difficulties finding investors. Acklen was eventually forced out by several of the project's backers. After they too had difficulties finding investors they abandoned the company. After the company's president threatened to order a halt to anymore work, Brackett bought him out and became the president himself. Construction gradually progressed, however the company's financial situation remained precarious. Only a few of Brackett's personal friends (including railroad barons James J. Hill and William Cornelius Van Horne) and some Seattle-based investors kept the project alive. In March 1898 the partially completed road was opened and Brackett began collecting tolls from those who used it. He had hoped to convert the road into a more lucrative railroad, however the Canadian government had already chartered a railroad using a different route. Brackett eventually formed a deal to lease access on his road to the railroad for moving construction equipment and supplies. While it was still used on a limited basis by prospectors in late 1898 and 1899 it was left largely unused and abandoned after that. Later life and death After the end of the White Pass wagon road, Brackett and his sons invested in a mining operation near Atlin Lake, British Columbia. In 1905 he returned to Minneapolis and lived a quiet retired life at his lake home in Orono, Minnesota. He died in 1921 and is buried at Lakewood Cemetery. Brackett Field Park in Minneapolis is named in his honor. Electoral history *Minneapolis Mayoral Election, 1873 **George Augustus Brackett 2,188 **Eli B.
