The bombing took place near an area where many minority Shiite Muslims live. At least ten Hazara, including nine Shiites, were among the dead. Two paramilitary soldiers were also killed in the bombing. PM Imran Khan expressed condolences for the lives lost, directed the authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured, and ordered an increase in security for Shiites and Hazara people. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and ISIL later accepted responsibility for the attack, stating that \\"their target were Hazara people.\\"  Background  Hazaras have been frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. They have been heavily targeted in Afghanistan in attacks claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State. 509 Hazara people has been killed in terror related incidents in the last 5 years alone in Quetta. Most of them have been killed in targeted killings, mass shootings, and suicide attacks. Sunni extremist groups consider Hazara people to be kafirs, as they are predominantly Shia.  Blast  A suicide attack was carried out in the late afternoon of 12 April 2019 by the Sunni militant at a potato stall in a crowded Hazarganji vegetable market. One survivor reported the blast being so powerful that the air was filled with black smoke and people were unable to hear each other. 20 people including one paramilitary soldier were killed, as well as the perpetrator. On 16 April, one more paramilitary soldier died of his injuries.  Responsibility  Initially, no group claimed responsibility for the blast. After some hours, the leader of Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack and issued a warning that more attacks were planned. A spokesperson of the group, Qari Saifullah, told CNN \\"We claim responsibility for the attack in Quetta, we targeted the Hazara community.\\" The same group had previously carried out attacks against Hazara minorities. ISIL also claimed the responsibility of this attack, releasing a photograph of the bomber along with his name. Various Sunni militant groups in Pakistan, including Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, have been backed by ISIL for several years.  Reaction  Pakistan's ruling Government PTI condemned the attack and wrote on Twitter: \\"We strongly condemn the terrorist attack in #Quetta that resulted in the loss of innocent lives. Prayers for the injured and for the precious lives lost in this heinous attack. Condolences to the families who lost their loved ones. Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's restive southwestern province of Balochistan, is often targeted by militants, although this was the first such attack this year. \\"We will not bow before terrorists,\\" Balochistan's chief minister, Jam Kamal Khan, said in a statement shortly after the bombing. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan echoed the condemnation. In a tweet, he wrote: \\"Deeply saddened & have strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Hazarganji market area of Quetta targeting our innocent people. I have asked for an immediate inquiry & increased security for the (people). Prayers go to the families of the victims & for early recovery of the injured.\\" Minister of state of Interior Shehryar Khan Afridi condemn the attack and wrote on Twitter,\\" A coward attempt to hit the civilians in Quetta.

I wil(will) stand by my words.\\" After 4 days of sit-in, protesters ended the protest after the successful talks, he wrote on Twitter,\\"Our Hazara Community calls off to sit in; reflecting the tradition of high values & trust they have on the state Pak. Thanking Prov & Federal Govt for sharing their pain. I am indebted to respect bestowed by community elders for ending sit in. Thankful to CM Balochistan & @sayedzbukhari.\\" Opposition Party, Pakistan Peoples Party's leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari condemned the attack. In a tweet, he wrote: \\"Condemn the terrorist attack in #Quetta. The government must stop dragging its feet & take action to counter violent extremism. Thoughts and prayers with the families of the victims.\\" People of Pakistan strongly condemned this attack, alongside Pakistani journalists, anchors, TV and political personalities. Though, no one from the ex-ruling Pmln party condemns the attack significantly, let alone Ahsan Iqbal and Maryam Aurangzeb. Ahsan Iqbal wrote in the tweet, \\"Extremely saddened to hear Quetta blast news. Strongly condemn this attack. Govt must ensure those behind this attack are brought to justice. Prayers for the departed souls\\" Thomas Drew CMG is a British diplomat who is High Commissioner to Pakistan, condemn the attack, he wrote in a tweet, \\"Horrific attack this morning in #Quetta.

We mourn with our Pakistani brothers and sisters for the attack in Quetta. Terrorism is a monster to be defeated. Heartfelt condolences @SMQureshiPTI.\\" ‚ÄúWe received the news with deep sorrow that a bomb blast which took place at a marketplace today in Quetta, capital of the Balochistan province of Pakistan, resulted in many loss of lives and left many others wounded, We condemn this heinous terrorist attack and wish Allah's mercy upon those who lost their lives, a speedy recovery to the wounded, and convey our condolences to the Government and brotherly people of Pakistan,‚Äù the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in the statement. In a statement, the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Pakistan said Saudi Arabia stood with Pakistan against all forms of violence, terrorism and extremism. ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia also shares grief with the government and people of Pakistan and prays for early recovery of those injured in the incident,‚Äù the statement added.  Aftermath  = Protests = The Hazara people protested regarding the perceived lack of security for them, claiming that \\"the Hazara community was being targeted but they weren‚Äôt provided effective security.\\" Provincial Home Minister Zia Lango visited the site but dialogue with the Hazara community failed once again on security purposes. Hazaras demanded security from Prime Minister Imran Khan. Shortly after the bombing struck near a Shiite residential area, dozens of angry Shiite youths rallied in Quetta, demanding more security from the authorities and the arrest of those behind the attacks. They also denounced the violence by Sunni extremists who have killed hundreds in similar attacks over the past years in Balochistan province. \\"It seems people from the (Shiite) Hazara community were the target,\\" said senior police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema. Members of the Hazara community staged a sit-in at Quetta's Western Bypass for over 23 hours, demanded better security measures following the blast. Women and children are among those who staged a sit-in since shortly after the blast. The protesters demanded that the government implements an effective security plan and ensure the protection of the Hazara community. Pakistani Shiite youth from Hazara community burn tires to block the main road during a protest to condemn the attack. Hazara protesters refuse to end the Quetta sit-in even after the third day, with protesters continuing to block the western bypass. Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Syed Ali Haider Zaidi arrived in the provincial capital and met the affected families on the behalf of Prime Minister Imran Khan, stating \\"Federal government claimed full responsibility of protecting its citizens regardless of their caste, creed, religion or province and Government is taking strict action and seriously pursuing the investigations into the suicide attack.\\" However, the protesters refused to call off their sit-in, demanded the attendance of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the capture of people behind the suicide attack and security of Hazara people. Representing the protesters, advocate Tahir Hazara expressed dismay over the federal government's attitude and regretted that Prime Minister Imran Khan had no time to visit Quetta after the tragic incident. However, he stated no one was safe in Quetta, saying that along with ordinary people, security personnel too had been martyred, adding that it raised questions over the capabilities of the government. He said the state must act without further delay because the people were tired of lifting the coffins of their loved ones. Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) president Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal visited the protest camp of the Hazara community and expressed solidarity with the protestors. A large number of people also staged a protest demonstration outside the Quetta Press Club after marching on main roads, protests erupted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab too. After 4 days, the Hazara community ends sit-in after receiving assurances from state minister, Balochistan CM. However, protesters still demanded Imran Khan to visit them, \\"Prime Minister Imran Khan should come and console us,\\" Muhammad Raza, another participant of the sit-in, had said. \\"This time the government should go beyond words and do something practical for our protection.\\" Minister of state of Interior Shehryar Khan Afridi had visited the Imam Bargah located in Hazara town to condole with the bereaved family members, speaking to the media, Afridi said \\"The federal government will play its role in making sure that these heinous crimes end, I stand with the community and I assure you that the government has been working to ensure that such crimes end. That is why this was the first such incident to occur over the span of nine months,\\" \\"we won't let anyone divide Pakistan\\", he added. On 16 April, both President Arif Alvi and the opposition party's leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited Quetta to offer condolences to Hazara community, President Arif Alvi showed solidarity to families and said \\"The entire nation stands by the Hazara community in this hour of grief,\\" acknowledged it was the responsibility of the state to protect the people and said \\"Nation stands united.\\"Earlier, talking to media persons in Quetta, the president had reaffirmed the government's commitment towards the implementation of the National Action Plan and commended CM Balochistan's commitment of announcing a compensation package for the victims. Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Bilawal Zardari condemns the government and point out their duel standards, he said, \\"On one hand they say the government is standing with the victims of the incident, and on the other a video exists where a federal minister is seen giving assurances to murderers and saying that no one will be able to touch them, Till when will have these dual standards, till when will this terrorism continue, victims need to be mainstreamed not terrorists.\\" He showed condolence to the victims and also praised the army for eliminating the terrorists in recent years but he also provoked the emotional sentiments, stated, ‚ÄúNo one can fight extremism alone, but we have to decide for the future. We need to fight this extremist mindset. When we ask for justice, we are called an enemy of the state. When I speak against banned organisations, I‚Äôm branded an enemy of the state.\\" he referred to his recent controversy where he was accused of using the Indian Sentiments against Pakistan's Government of not taking strict action against terrorist's organisations. Arif Alvi also promised that Imran Khan will visit Balochistan on April 18. Khan will visit the victims in Quetta, he is scheduled to preside over an important meeting to analyse peace and security situation in Balochistan.

The film produced by Shri Narotam Ji Films and bankrolled by Ankit Vijan, Navdeep Narula, Gurjit Singh and Santosh Subhash Thite, stars Sargun Mehta, Gurnam Bhullar, Rupinder Rupi and Nisha Bano. Film production started on 4 April 2019 and was theatrically released on 30 August 2019 to positive reviews with Gurnam Bhullar and Sargun Mehta's chemistry being highly praised by critics and audiences. The film performed well at the box office with a domestic gross of INR 7.20 crores ($1.02 million) . Synopsis Surkhi Bindi (Red dot sticker which women apply on their forehead) is the story of a village girl's dream to migrate to Canada and how her husband fulfills her dream by giving her wings with his limited resources but someone with a very big heart. Randeep Kaur alias Raano (Sargun Mehta) as a child in a Punjab village always dreamt of marrying her Prince Charming and moving to Canada. But when she grows up she soon realizes that her dreams were dreams only as all her school friends made it big in life except for her. She works in the city at a beauty parlour and is brilliant at her job. One day as per suggestion from her younger sister, she visits an immigration consultant who advises her to join a two-year course in a Canadian cosmetology college post which she can obtain her permanent residence status. She is supposed to pay Rs. 4 lakhs every semester plus Rs. 5 lakhs upfront as their commission. Raano says she doesn't have any money at which the immigration consultant tells her not to worry as there were several guys here who are willing to shell out that much money to obtain a Canadian permanent residence by marrying her on paper. She is hesitant to do this contract marriage but the immigration consultant sends a prospective groom to the beauty parlour where she works, without her knowledge and he creates a scene with her and everyone there. She is therefore fired from the job and when she returns to her village, her father gets her married to Sukhwinder Singh alias Sukha (Gurnam Bhullar) against her will. She then moves to her in-law's house where she has to live with Sukha's non-cooperative aunt and abusive brother-in-law. She is very unhappy with Sukha and starts cursing her fate as she is now become a housewife but Sukha then starts changing her mind towards him by telling her not to give up in life and that she should temporarily start her own beauty parlour and move to Canada within six months from the earnings. Sukha's brother-in-law gets jealous and drives them away from the house and they then move to the city where the landlady helps her by set up the beauty parlour in her leased upper floor apartment and also helps her to get new clients by referring her shop customers to the beauty parlour. Sukha personally helps Raano in the beauty parlour by doing all the odd jobs like cleaning, mopping and serving tea to her clients. Soon their world turns around and they start earning money and even the landlady later helps them in their personal life by getting Sukha's cousin brother freed from the jail and then the aunt changes for good and starts living together with Sukha and Raano along with her son. Sukha and Raano have saved money but still fall Rs. 2 lakhs short to give to the immigration consultant. So they borrow some money from the landlady and collect some more from Sukha's company friends who start a chit fund to help each other. Meanwhile, Sukha's brother-in-law gets to know of the money which Sukha has collected and demands its from him otherwise he threatens to throw Sukha's sister out from his home. Sukha gives in to this threat and therefore gives him the money but still Sukha's sister and her kids leave that house as her husband beat her up and they therefore start living with Sukha and Raaano. Now with no money left for Raano to migrate to Canada, the landlady advises her to participate in a bridal make-up artist contest held by real life actress Neeru Bajwa. Raano is looked down by the event manager as she is a simpleton and doesn't know English but still goes on to win the competition through her hard work and supportive husband who keeps encouraging her to never give up. On the stage when she receives the trophy, she gives a speech that no one in her life ever supported her and everyone including her father crushed her dream but her husband lifted her up and supported her at every step and made her dreams turn into reality and that every girl should get a thoughtful & supportive husband like Sukha. She also conveys that she will now not go to Canada as Canada is here in India only through the love and happiness that her husband gives her. She then invites him on stage and everyone applauds them. The film closes by showing them having a new beauty parlour at Sukha's village where she is taking care of her client who is Sukha's classmate.

Production =Background= On June 5, 2018 it was reported that AAA secured two dates to run a show at Madison Square Garden due to MSG executives being unhappy with WWE running rival venue Barclays Center instead of Madison Square Garden with MSG executives being more open to other wrestling promotions running the venue.http://www.pwinsider.com/article/118328/does-aaa-still-have-dates-at- madison-square-garden.html?p=1 On June 22, 2018 it was reported by Pro Wrestling Insider that AAA would push the show date from fall 2018 to September 2019 with the promotion using the second date as backup date for Las Vegas show.https://www.pwinsider.com/article/118328/does-aaa-still-have-dates- at-madison-square-garden.html?p=1 In April 2019, it was announced that Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide would be running a show at Madison Square Garden. During the press conference held about the future event in MSG, it was announced that tickets would be available for sale on May 5. Lucha Invades NY was intended to be the second professional wrestling event held at Madison Square Garden (the first being G1 Supercard) by a professional wrestling promotion not owned by the McMahon family since November 14, 1960. It was later reported by Wrestling Observer Newsletter journalist Dave Meltzer that AAA initial ticket sales for the event were 2,000 tickets. On August 16, it was announced that the event would be held in the much smaller Hulu Theater inside of Madison Square Garden. Later it was reported by Pro Wrestling Insider that AAA's decision of running Hulu Theater was made two weeks before the announcement after meeting with MSG executives to move the venue due to its poor initial ticket sales. =Storylines= The show featured eight professional wrestling matches, with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in wrestling matches. In her return to Impact Wrestling on September 27, 2018, Taya Valkyrie challenged Tessa Blanchard to a title match for the Impact Knockouts Championship. At Bound for Glory, Blanchard retained the title by using the ring ropes. Three weeks later, Taya received a rematch, which was once again won by Blanchard who attacked the referee and got herself disqualified, retaining the title in the process. At Homecoming, which took place on January 6, 2019, Taya won the Impact Knockouts Championship after the special guest referee Gail Kim (whom Blanchard had attacked during their match) performed her finishing move that allowed Taya to execute her own finishing move before she pinned her. A rematch from Homecoming, this time for Blanchard's AAA Reina de Reinas Championship, was later signed for Lucha Invades NY. On October 26, 2018, at H√©roes Inmortales XII, Blue Demon Jr. betrayed Dr. Wagner Jr. during Wagner's match against Jeff Jarrett, which Wagner still won. In December, Blue Demon Jr. continued to cement his role as Wagner's rival. On February 10, 2019, Wagner emerged victorious against Blue Demon Jr. in a Street Fight and that same night, challenged Demon to a Lucha de Apuestas, a challenge that was not answered at the time. On February 27, AAA announced that Blue Demon Jr. and Wagner would face off in a Luchas de Apuestas as the main event of Tripleman√≠a XXVII. At Tripleman√≠a, Blue Demon Jr. defeated Wagner, forcing Wagner to shave his head. After the match Wagner announced his retirement from professional wrestling, however, the next day after Tripleman√≠a XXVII, Wagner declared that it was not his last match as a wrestler and he would fulfill his commitments before his final retirement in 2020. A Tripleman√≠a No DQ rematch was then announced for Lucha Invades NY. In February 2019, former UFC heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez made statements branding Lucha Libre as \\"fake\\" and \\"a show without real blows.\\" On March 26, at an AAA press conference, Velasquez announced that he had signed with the company and was then confronted by a group on AAA wrestlers, including Texano Jr. On July 2, AAA announced that a trios match pitting Velasquez, Psycho Clown, and Cody Rhodes against Los Mercenarios (Texano Jr. and Taurus) and a surprise partner was signed for Tripleman√≠a XXVI. At the event, Velasquez's team was victorious. Velasquez's second match, which will see him team with Psycho Clown and Brian Cage against Los Mercenarios (Texano Jr., Taurus, and Rey Escorpi√≥n), was later announced for Lucha Invades NY.

C. Emmons or J. P. C. Emmons, was an American attorney and politician who served as the 12th Florida Attorney General.  Early life and education  Emmons was born on January 1, 1818 in Hudson Falls, New York. Emmons moved to Detroit, Michigan with his father and brother in 1836; his father, Adonijah, was an attorney, and his brother, Halmor Hull, would later become a federal judge. Upon arrival, Emmons became the private secretary for Michigan Governor Stevens T. Mason, and much of his early legal education came from Mason. In 1838, Mason appointed Emmons as the Clerk of the Michigan House of Representatives, though he would only stay in that position for a year in order to continue his legal studies. Emmons was admitted into the Michigan Bar in 1840 and began a law practice in Detroit with his father and brother the same year, named A. Emmons & Sons.  Political career  In 1848, Emmons, a Democrat, was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives, representing Wayne County. Although he served on the powerful State Affairs and Ways and Means committees, Emmons resigned within the year, opting to return to private practice. In 1851, Emmons was appointed to be the commissioner of the circuit court of Marquette County, Michigan by Governor John S. Barry. In 1853, he was elected to the Wayne County School Board, though he would resign the following year. In 1855, Governor Kinsley S. Bingham appointed Emmons as the Prosecuting Attorney for Wayne County. He held this position until 1857. In 1854, Emmons joined the newly created Republican Party. With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Emmons enlisted in the Union Army, serving in Company K of the 1st Michigan Cavalry. Emmons, who began as a private and rose all the way to captain, was also part of the Michigan Brigade, which was under the command of Brigadier General George Armstrong Custer. This brigade, a collection of various Michigan cavalry regiments, fought in every major campaign of the war from the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 to the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse in April 1865. After the war, Emmons settled in Jacksonville, Florida. In 1872, Florida Governor Harrison Reed, another carpetbagger Republican from the Midwest, appointed Emmons as Florida Attorney General following the resignation of Horatio Bisbee, Jr. Emmons served in this position until January 1873, when Judge William A. Cocke was officially elected to be Bisbee's successor.  Personal life and death  Emmons was married to Martha Eason Davisson, a native Illinoisan. Emmons died at his home in Jacksonville on April 15, 1877. He is buried in Detroit's Elmwood Cemetery.

Her works also include middle grade novels, short stories, and historical, socio-political, and economy-related non- fiction.  Personal life  Magoon was born in Michigan and grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She is the biracial daughter of a white American mother with Dutch and Scottish ancestry and a black Cameroonian father. As a child, she spent a few years living in Cameroon. Prior to becoming a writer, she worked for non-profit organizations in New York City. She graduated with a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University, where she majored in History, with a concentration on Africa and the Middle East. Magoon has a master of fine arts degree in Writing from Vermont College of Fine Arts, which she was able to study via a low-residency program for children's writers. In 2015, she taught writing in New York City and served as a judge for School Library Journal. In 2017, she was faculty at the Highlights Foundation, a non-profit organization in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, where she taught a workshop about developing new creative strategies through meditation sessions, workshop elements, and discussion, together with authors Laurie Calkhoven and Nicole Valentine. She is a member of the NWP Writers Council. Magoon lives in Vermont and teaches writing at the Vermont College of Fine Arts.  Selected works  Magoon says that all her novels deal with how ordinary kids can make a difference in the world. Her debut novel, The Rock and the River, set in 1968 Chicago and follows the story of the 13-year-old son of a civil rights activist and follower of Martin Luther King Jr., who has to deal with his brother joining the Black Panther Party. It discusses issues of class, race, and poverty. Magoon says she spent time deliberately researching the non-violent civil rights movement, has always had an interest in history, and majored in History in college. She initially had the idea to write the novel between her first semester at Northwestern University and revised the first draft during her second and third semester, before submitting The Rock and the River as her thesis. She wrote her fourth young adult novel, How It Went Down, about the aftermath of the shooting of a black teenager, in response to the shooting of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. Frustrated by the media coverage's bias, she decided to write a fictionalized story that explored what it would be like to be personally affected through a close family member or friend being killed. Magoon's sixth young adult novel X is a fictionalized account of civil rights activist Malcolm X's formative years and co-authored with his daughter, Ilyasah Shabazz. Shabazz says her agent chose Magoon as a co-writer based on the quality of her previous work and the themes she tackled in her novels. Her seventh Middle Grade novel, The Season of Styx Malone, about three African American boys living in a small town in Indiana, United States, who swap their little sister for fireworks, was published by Wendy Lamb books in 2018. Magoon says that she loosely based the novel on a real event from her childhood, when an ice cream parlor clerk in North Carolina told them about how his father and uncle once tried to trade their baby sister. In July 2019 it was announced that Magoon would be publishing a non-fiction young adult novel about the legacy of the Black Panthers, called Until All Are Free: The Black Panther Party's Call for Revolution and slated for a tentative publication date with Candlewick in 2021.  Critical reception  Magoon's novels have earned starred reviews from multiple literary magazines. Her novels Light It Up, The Season of Styx Malone, X, and Ibi Zoboi's anthology Black Enough: Stories of Being Young and Black in America that she contributed a short story for, and How It Went Down have received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly. They also chose How It Went Down as a Publisher's Weekly Pick. Kirkus Reviews awarded her debut novel Camo Girl How it Went Down, Marc Aronson and Susan Campbell Bartoletti's 1968: Today's Authors Explore a Year of Rebellion, Revolution, and Change, and The Season of Styx Malone a starred review, calling the latter \\"Heartening and hopeful, a love letter to black male youth grasping the desires within them, absorbing the worlds around them, striving to be more otherwise than ordinary.\\" School Library Journal gave starred reviews to Rebellion of Thieves, Jessica Spotswood's anthology A Tyranny of Petticoats: 15 Stories of Belles, Bank Robbers and Other Badass Girls, and The Season of Styx Malone. The Season of Styx Malone was especially praised by critics, also earning a starred review from Shelf Awareness and The Horn Book, and being named one of the best books of 2018 by Kirkus Reviews. X, co- authored with Ilyasah Shabazz, was one of five novels in 2015 to receive six starred reviews.

It was co-written with novelist Christophe Bataille and published in 2011 by Grasset Publishing. This book is also an essay and report that documents the one-on-one conversations between Rithy Panh and Duch, a former Khmer Rouge officer.. To better represent the Khmer Rouge regime and to further influence the reader's mind, Rithy Pan juxtaposed his own personal story with the interviews with Duch Rithy Panh's testimony is in line with the most famous, such as Primo Levi and Claude Lanzmann. Using a detailed analysis of the horrors committed by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979, the Elimination reflects the totalitarian regime that claimed the lives of more than 1.7 million people.  The author  Rithy Panh is a Cambodian director and writer born in 1962 in Phnom Penh. He first became known to the general public through the release of a documentary on the high school transformed into a torture centre, S-21, The Khmer Rouge Death Machine. Rithy Panh was 13 years old at the time of the genocide.  The objective of the book  In The Elimination, Rithy Pan undertook to paint a portrait of Kaing Guek Eav - better known as Duch - and the first Khmer Rouge officer to have appeared before the United Nations courts for crimes against humanity, torture and murder. The director recounts in parallel his interviews with Duch, which lasted three years, and how he felt about them. In the book, he explains that he initially tried to understand the reasons for this basic crime. But, quickly, he acknowledges that it is impossible to want to understand what is not understandable. His objective then became to push Duch to take responsibility for the crimes committed, to record by word what happened during these four years. The Elimination is also a fight led by Rithy Pan against the falsification of history.. Its literary and cinematographic productions present the same dynamic. Rithy Pan works against the erasure and denial of reality in a society where young Cambodians are confronted with overwhelming silence from their elders. One third of the population witnessed this period. Elimination makes the reader both a spectator and a repository of knowledge that he or she must in turn pass on. The author follows the approach adopted by sociologist Marcel Mauss  Historical background  The Khmer Rouge have abolished all Cambodian institutions. The land was collectivized, schools and pagodas were transformed into torture centres. Angkar has established itself as the only legitimate organization to lead the country. Everything was submitted to Angkar: identity, social and professional life, as well as the family sphere. The only family that now existed was Angkar and the regime encouraged denunciation. Angkar gave new surnames to Cambodians in order to dehumanize them and remove all ties. Rithy Panh tells in The Elimination that he became Mr. Bald in reference to his shaved head. Mr. Panh writes: \\"From that day on, I, Rithy Panh, thirteen years old, have no more history, no more family, no more emotions, no more thoughts, no more unconscious. Was there a name? Was there an individual? There's nothing anymore.\\" Proceeding like the Nazi regime, the novlangue was mobilized.. In short, the objective of the regime was elimination. During an interview, Duch said to Rithy Pan \\"Mr. Rithy, the Khmer Rouge is about elimination.

He is sometimes confused with Johannes (Jan or Johan) Baethen, a printer active in Leuven and Cologne between 1552 and 1562, who was likely his brother. Jacob was active in Leuven, Maastricht and D√ºsseldorf. He is mainly remembered for his publication of the so-called Maastricht songbook of 1554, which is one of only five surviving song books in the Dutch language from the 16th century.Ben J.P. Salemans, Jacob Bathen, printer, publisher and bookseller in Louvain, Maastricht and D√ºsseldorf c. 1545 to c. 1557, in: Quaerendo, Volume 19. Issue 1-2Susan Bain, \\"Baethen [Batius, Bathenius, Jacob]\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell, London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001 Life Little is known about the early life of Jacob Bathen as many of the Leuven city records relating to the period of his life in Leuven have been lost. It is believed that he was born in Leuven in or before 1516. He parents were Arnold Bathen and Marie Stroots. He had two brothers named Johan or Jan (who was possibly also a printer) and Godfried. Bathen grew up on the homestead in Vinckenbosch (Vinkenbos), which was part of the Park Abbey near Louvain. In 1530 he matriculated under the name 'Jacobus Baten de Parco' as an 'artes' (arts) student at the university in Louvain. He graduated in about 1535 with the title of 'magister'. Colophon of 'Des chansons reduictz en tabulature de lut ‚Ä¶' published by Phalesius in 1547 Bathen trained in the art of printing, most likely with a printer based in Louvain, who may have been Servaas van Sassen (also called Servatius Sassenus). He may also have worked for some time as a corrector or proofreader at this printing press. He started out as a printer for his own account in 1545 working in partnership with Reynier Velpen van Diest. He obtained on 4 November 1546 and 5 October 1547 patents that permitted him to print and sell books. These patents apparently did not extend to bookbinding. It looks very much as if Jacob Bathen was one of the two bookbinders or booksellers who stamped their bindings with the Spes plate stamp. Possibly the lines of the IB monogram form the initials of Bathen's name. He worked as a book printer for local publishers such as Petrus Phalesius, a publisher who specialized mainly in musical scores. For Phalesius he printed the first, third, fourth and perhaps also the fifth edition of the collection Des chansons reduictz en tabulature de lut a deux, trois et quatre parties ‚Ä¶, Leuven, 1547. This was the first musical edition of Phalesius and the first collection of scores for lute in the Low Countries. In addition to music scores, Bathen printed official publications and religious pamphlets, some of which were published by Petrus Phalesius and Martinus de Raymaker (known as 'Martinus Rotarius'). Title page of Jean de Latre's 'Lamentationes aliquot Ieremiae', part for tenor, published by Baethen in 1554 Bathen married Katrien van den Berghe with whom he had at least six children. The competition in the Leuven printing market was fierce and to cope with it some printers partnered up with one another. The difficulty to make ends meet likely forced Jacob Bathen to leave Leuven at the end of 1551 or early 1552 and to settle in Maastricht. Here he was the first printer and as a result he operated in a cultural environment in which he was unlikely to find many customers.Benito Rial Costas, Print Culture and Peripheries in Early Modern Europe: A Contribution to the History of Printing and the Book Trade in Small European and Spanish Cities, BRILL, 9 Nov 2012, p. 151 In three or four years, he published at least eleven books, including two music editions.Louis Peter Grijp, The Maastricht Songbook (Niewe Duytsche Liedekens, 1554), 1999 In 1554 he printed a musical work in Maastricht by the composer Jean de Latre from Li√®ge. The work was entitled Lamentationes aliquot Jeremiae musicae harmoniae noviter adaptatae, adjectis aliquot sacris cantionibus, trium, quatuor, quinque et sex vocum and was dedicated to Anton of Schauenburg, at that time the dean of the Saint Servatius chapter in Maastricht, and later archbishop of Cologne. Bathen used so-called 'movable musical note types' for the first time. The movable types are now in the Heilbronn city library and constitute one of the most important musical artefacts from this period. In Maastricht Bathen was still not able to thrive as a printer and bookseller. At the end of 1554 or the beginning of 1555 he moved his business to D√ºsseldorf to become a printer at the court of the Duke of J√ºlich, Willem V van Kleef. Here he was the first publisher of polyphonic songs.Henri Vanhulst , Le Bassus novi prorsus et elegantis libri musici (1561). Un recueil allemand de motets et de chansons fran√ßaises, tant spirituelles que profanes, de compositeurs des anciens Pays-Bas, in: Revue belge de Musicologie / Belgisch Tijdschrift voor Muziekwetenschap Vol. 53 (1999), pp. 19-39 In 1555-1556 he published three bundles of motets for the heirs of Arnold Birckmann. In 1557 he published a music theory book by the Dutch teacher, publisher and music theorist Johannes Oridryus, entitled Practicae musicae utriusque praecepta brevia. The typeface that Bathen used in Maastricht and D√ºsseldorf for his music editions is the same as that used by Phalesius in Leuven during this period. It has been assumed that Bathen took it with him from Leuven. It is not clear whether it was Bathen or Phalesius who invented this font. In the end Bathen's business did not fare better in D√ºsseldorf. Jacob Bathen returned before 1558 to his parental home near Heverlee possibly travelling via Cologne where his brother Johan is believed to have been active as a printer at the time. In 1558 Johannes Oridryus and his cousin Albertus Buysius continued Bathen's printing business in D√ºsseldorf. It was in particular Oridyrus who ensured that Bathen's music printing materials were put to good use.Jan Willem Bonda, De meerstemmige Nederlandse liederen van de vijftiende en zestiende eeuw, Uitgeverij Verloren, 1996, p.138 Oridyrus and Buysius, among others, published another fifty psalms (Souterliedekens), set to music by Cornelis Boscoop. Bathen died in 1558, probably in Leuven or Heverlee. His widow remarried. Printed works A total of 57 publications have been ascribed to the printing press of Bathen. While Bathen's speciality was certainly the printing of musical works with musical notation such as staves and tablature for the lute, his press also printed ordinances and decrees for both religious and government authorities and works on a wide range of subjects such as mathematical, poetical, medical and grammatical works, sermons and musical treatises. Niewe Duytsche Liedekens (The Maastricht Songbook), 1554 Title page of Niewe Duytsche Liedekens. published by Bathen in Maastricht in 1554 His best-known work is the Niewe Duytsche Liedekens, met III. IIII. V. VI. ende VIII. partyen (New Dutch songs in 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 parts), printed in 1554. The publication is also referred to as Dat ierste boeck vanden Niewe Duytsche Liedekens (That first book of New Dutch songs) as well as The Maastricht Songbook, first of all because of the place where it was published. The title page shows in the background a panorama of some landmarks of Maastricht and includes the city arms with a single star handing from a tree branch. The publication groups polyphonic Dutch songs by various composers, of whom some were famous in their time such as Jacobus Clemens non Papa and others who were of rather local renown such as Ludovicus Episcopius, Franciscus Florius and Jean de Latre. When the music printer Petrus Phalesius for whom Bathen had previously printed some publications, published in 1572 in Leuven his collection of Dutch- language songs under the title Een Duytsch musyck boeck (A Dutch music book), no less than half of the songs were copied from The Maastrich Songbook. One of the principal reasons why the publication is relevant for music history is that the songs collected in it were in the Dutch language. The compositions in The Maastricht Songbook used the standard written Dutch that was common at that time. At the time of publication, secular music for the elite was primarily written in the French language. Even Dutch-language composers tended to use French or even Italian for their songs. The first music publisher in the Dutch (Flemish) speaking world to challenge this dominance of French was Tielman Susato, a music publisher and composer active in Antwerp. Susato launched an appeal to Flemish and Dutch-speaking composers to create songs in their mother tongue in order to show that native language music was not inferior to that made with French, Latin or Italian lyrics. Susato issued his appeal in his lerste musyck boexken (First music booklet) of 1551. This publication included four-part vocal music composed in the Dutch language. Susato followed up with a Tweeste musyck boexken (Second music booklet) in the same year, and continued to print Dutch-language songs with the three-part Souterliedekens (Psalter-songs) by Clemens non Papa (1556-57) and the four- part Souterliedekens by Gerardus Mes (1561), both published in four volumes. Susato's initiative was taken up by other Flemish publishers the first of whom was Jacob Bathen with The Maastricht Songbook of 1554. Phalesius would follow in Leuven in 1572 with Een Duytsch musyck boeck, half of the songs of which were recycled from The Maastricht Songbook. Sheet music for the song \\"Al hadde wy vijfenveertich bedde\\" by Jean de Latre from the \\"Niewe Duytsche Liedekens\\" The Maastricht Songbook contains music by a number of local composers. Eight compositions are by Ludovicus Episcopius and these are the only ones in five, six and eight parts. Other composers chose were working in other locations in the Netherlands, including Jacobus Clemens non Papa in Bruges who worked in 's Hertogenbosch and probably Ypres, Jan van Wintelroy who was active in 's-Hertogenbosch and Servaes van der Meulen who worked in Bergen op Zoom. The composers Joannes Zacheus, Claudius Salmier, Theodor Evertz and Pierken Jordain who also had works included in the publication remain fairly unknown otherwise and it is not known where they worked. The soprano part in the five part books has been lost. It has been possible to recover the soprano part for some songs as they were also included in Phalesius' Een Duytsch musyck boeck and some other documents. The Maastricht Songbook was most likely used for entertainment by the upper and middle class of that time. The prevalent theme of the songs is love, and in particular the May songs which describe how the blooming and awakening of spring makes the blood of lovers race. In the song De Iustelijcke mey (The joyful May) (no. 4) a lover presents his sweetheart with a May branch. Some of the love songs are quite suggestive, such as the Een aerdich meysken seer jonck van jaren (A nice girl, very young of age) (no. 28) in which a shepherd lets his 'piglet' root in the girl's 'garden'. Some of the songs in The Maastricht Songbook clearly have a comical intention, such as a number of songs that deal with drinking including one by the respectable religious composer Clemens non Papa. There is also a humorous song called Ick zou studeren in eenen hoeck (I would study in a corner) (no. 15) describing a student who cannot concentrate on his studies because of the noisy street outside.

On 9 April the trade union SAFTU stated their support for the protests and called on other areas in Gauteng province to join.

Bradley, based on the Marvel Comics series of the same name. It explores what would happen if major moments from the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) occurred differently. The series is produced by Marvel Studios, their first animated series since becoming their own production company. Bradley serves as head writer of the series, with Bryan Andrews directing. Jeffrey Wright stars as the Watcher, who narrates the series. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of series for Disney+, and one based on the What If...? comic was first reported in March 2019. The series was officially announced a month later, with many characters in the series set to be voiced by the actors who portray them in the films. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' cel-shaded animation style, which was designed to reflect the films. Half of the first season's animation is provided by Squeeze, with Stephan Franck serving as head of animation on the series. What If...?s first season is expected to be released in mid-2021, and will consist of 10 episodes. It will be part of Phase Four of the MCU. A second 10-episode season has been announced.  Premise  The series explores what would happen if major moments from the Marvel Cinematic Universe occurred differently.  Cast and characters  = Main = * Jeffrey Wright as Uatu / The Watcher: A member of the extraterrestrial Watcher race, who observes the multiverse and occasionally intervenes with events therein. Head writer A.C. Bradley said the Watcher is \\"above everything else\\" and compared the character to a viewer watching the \\"pizza rat\\" video, stating that he is \\"a guy watching a rat drag a slice of pizza across the platform. He has no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things. He just goes, 'Man, this is remarkable. Look at the little guy go'! That is The Watcher's relationship with humanity\\". Bradley said Wright was cast in the role because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \\"warm personality\\". = Guests =  Production  = Development = By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+; Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was set to take a \\"hands-on role\\" in each series' development, focusing on \\"handling\\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films. By March 2019, Marvel Studios was planning to create an animated series based on the What If...? Marvel comics for Disney+. The anthology series, which would be produced by Feige, would explore how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if Loki wielded Thor's hammer Mjolnir. The hope was to have the actors who portray the characters in the MCU voice them in the series as well. A month later, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series. In December 2019, Feige revealed that the first season would consist of 10 episodes, and that work had already begun on a second 10-episode season. = Writing = Feige explained with the announcement of the series that the events that would be depicted as changed would be \\"pivotal moments\\" from throughout the MCU. He revealed that, for example, the first episode features Peggy Carter taking the super soldier serum instead of Steve Rogers. A.C. Bradley serves as head writer of the series, with Matthew Chauncey serving as story editor. Episodes were conceived and written by Bradley, Chauncey, series director Bryan Andrews, executive producer Brad Winderbaum, junior executive Simona Paparelli, and script coordinator Ryan Little, with the What If...? comics providing inspiration for potential story points. After creating 30 potential episode concepts, Feige chose his favorites, which were then narrowed down further to get the first season of episodes. Bradley originally pitched an episode which would have explored a possible reality in which Jane Foster became Thor. However, since the upcoming MCU film Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) is set to feature Foster as Thor, the idea was scrapped. After a rumor incorrectly stated that each episode would focus on one film from the Infinity Saga, Bradley clarified that multiple films and characters would be represented in each episode, with the intention of featuring most of the characters from all the films throughout the season. = Casting = Marvel's plan for the series was to have actors who portray characters in the MCU films reprise their roles in the series. At San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019, Feige revealed a cast list of these actors that included Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, Karen Gillan as Nebula, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, Sean Gunn as Kraglin, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, Taika Waititi as Korg, Toby Jones as Arnim Zola, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster, and Michael Rooker as Yondu. Feige also announced that Jeffrey Wright had been cast as the Watcher, who narrates the series. A month later, Atwell revealed that voice recording for the series had already begun. Goldblum indicated in November 2019 that Robert Downey Jr. would be reprising his role as Tony Stark in the series. = Animation = The series, directed by Andrews, will feature a cel-shaded animation style, with character likenesses based on the actors from the films. Ryan Meinerding, the head of visual development at Marvel Studios, worked with Andrews to find the animation style for the series, which Bradley described as more of a \\"cinematic style\\". Bradley added that Marvel was \\"trying to use the color palette, the lighting, [and] the character design to tell as much story as you can\\" similarly as in live-action film. Animation studio Squeeze will work on five of ten episodes in the series' first season. Stephan Franck serves as head of animation on the series. Production continued remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, with on-site work at the Walt Disney Studios lot suspended.  Marketing  Footage from the series' first episode was shown during the D23 2019, with footage from the series also included in Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.  Release  What If...? is expected to debut in mid-2021, and will consist of 10 episodes. It will be part of Phase Four of the MCU. A second season has been announced.

The company was formed after Colfax Corporation acquired Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH (STE) from Siemens in October 2017 for ‚Ç¨195 million. The old brand name K√ºhnle, Kopp & Kausch has been returned to use. The K√ºhnle, Kopp & Kausch AG (AG KK&K;) was a German mechanical engineering company based in Frankenthal. The company was acquired by Siemens and bore the name Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH (STE) until 2017. The company was renamed Howden Turbo GmbH through the sale to Colfax Corporation and Howden. History It was founded in 1899 by the merger of three family businesses by Georg Adam K√ºhnle, Hans Kopp and Rudolf Kausch. In 1983, the Motoren- und Turbinen-Union (MTU), Munich, acquired the majority of shares. After MTU was acquired by Daimler-Benz two years later, K√ºhnle, Kopp & Kausch became (indirectly) a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. The Penske Corporation acquired in 1994 the majority of Kuhnle, Kopp & Kausch from the Daimler-Benz group MTU. In 1997, BorgWarner Automotive, a leading global automotive supplier, acquired the majority of the shares in K√ºhnle, Kopp & Kausch. In 1998 the turbocharging systems division was spun off to become 3K-Warner Turbosystems as a subsidiary of BorgWarner. The company \\"Turbo Group\\" and the Frankfurt private equity firm ECM acquired K√ºhnle, Kopp & Kausch in March 2005. In July 2006 K√ºhnle, Kopp & Kausch was taken over by Siemens Power Generation Group. On November 22, 2006, this acquisition was completed by Siemens. K√ºhnle, Kopp & Kausch supplements the Siemens PG with industrial steam turbines up to five megawatts; in the case of \\"Tridem\\" and \\"Quadriga\\" systems (three or four turbines work together), up to ten megawatts are possible. Turbo compressors and process gas compressors complete the range offered by Siemens PG, with the turbocharger division for motor vehicles sold to BorgWarner in 1997. The turbines from K√ºhnle, Kopp & Kausch are used for power generation or as mechanical drives in industry. Compressors are used in the chemical industry as well as in the water and wastewater industry. Fans are used in power plants, mines and in the steel and cement industries. On June 12, 2007, the name of the company was changed to Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH (STE). In October 2015, Siemens Power Generation announced its intention to relocate the production of turbines to the Czech plant in Brno for cost reasons ; that would have meant cutting back 210 of the then 600 jobs. Following fierce protests and many discussions, including with the works council and IG Metall, Siemens Power Generation then began selling the complete plant from the beginning of 2016. The Scottish engineering company Howden, announced in March 2018 that it would take over the company. Howden is part of the US engineering group Colfax Corporation. The purchase price was 195 million euros. Along with the Palatine factory there are also branches in Springfield, Missouri, Helsingor, Denmark and Mornago, Italy.

The detainees launched a coordinated uprising to facilitate a breakout, but were foiled by the quick intervention of local security forces and the United States Air Force.  Background  As the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by the international CJTF‚ÄìOIR coalition, defeated the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in a number of campaigns during the Syrian Civil War, thousands of ISIL members were captured and detained at several facilities throughout Rojava. One of the most secure detention centers for ISIL members is the D√™rik prison in al-Malikiyah, a town near the Iraq-Syria border, where about 400 ISIL fighters were held. These included many international jihadists, including 20 French citizens, some of whom had been involved in the 2012 Toulouse and November 2015 Paris attacks. The French detainees are believed to have been among the chief organisers of the prison escape.  Escape attempt  On the morning of 5 April 2019, the prisoners took advantage of the lessened security amid their toilet hour. About 200 detainees simultaneously attacked the prison guards in an attempt to take a guard hostage, and capture firearms to facilitate an escape. The local security forces quickly responded to the uprising, and sent many SDF reinforcements to D√™rik prison. The United States Air Force dispatched two fighter jets which flew on a low altitude over the prison to frighten the revolting prisoners to surrender. After a few hours, the prison uprising was quelled, reportedly \\"peacefully\\". None of the prisoners managed to escape, though the revolt had reportedly come close to being a success.  Aftermath  CJTF‚ÄìOIR aircraft conducted aerial observation of the area after the escape attempt, ensuring that none of the inmates had fled. Security at D√™rik prison was heightened. The French prisoners were subsequently distributed to other detention centers at the request of the French government. This was done so that another organized escape attempt became less likely. SDF foreign relations official Redur Xelil stated that the escape attempt \\"shows that these people are terrorists, killers and constitute a danger, a situation we have repeatedly voiced before.\\" He also once again requested on behalf of the SDF international help in managing the prisoners.

His main collections were insect specimens and several species have been named after him. Fenichel was born in Nagyenyed and went to Bethlen College where he was influenced by K√°roly Herepey. Initially interested in archaeology, he spent some time working at the Bucharest archaeological museum from 1888. He travelled to Dobrudja in Romania during which time he met Albert Grubauer, a German naturalist who was planning an expedition to New Guinea. Fenichel showed interest, resigned from his post and joined Grubauer but with the understanding that he would obtain material for the Hungarian National Museum. They reached German New Guinea in 1891 and began collecting insect specimens. Grubauer left due to poor health but Fenichel stayed on collecting nearly 25000 specimens. Fenichel too fell ill, possibly from malaria, and in 1893 this led to severe kidney problems that led to his death at Stephansort. Fenichel was an inspiration for the naturalist- explorer Lajos B√≠r√≥. Fenichel's collections including insects and objects of ethnographic interest are now in the Hungarian National Museum. A memorial plaque in Port Moresby University commemorates his life.

From 1914, she ran her own dancing school for children in Copenhagen and in 1927 she founded the Asta Mollerup School for Female Dancers (Asta Mollerup Danserindeskolen). Apart from the Royal Danish Academy of Music, it was Denmark's only dancing school. Biography Born on 22 May 1881 in Copenhagen, Asta Malthea Mollerup was the daughter of the museum director Arthur Julius William Mollerup (1846‚Äì1917) and Caroline Susanne Ewald Rothe (1853‚Äì1938). She was initially trained as a dancer by a Russian ballet master in Oslo. On returning to Copenhagen in 1914, she opened a ballet and rhythmic dance school for children and young adults. Until 1925, she also taught gymnastics and dance at Marie M√∏rk's School in Hiller√∏d and at I. Ingwersen & H. Ellbrecht's School in Copenhagen. During this period, she continued her training as a dancer spending periods with Duncan and the Russian dancer Lyubov Yegorova in Paris and Wigman in Dresden. Her own courses developed from a foundation in classical ballet to far more expressive choreography based on trends in modern dance. The school she opened in 1927 (Danserindeskolen) was very special in that it not only taught dance with special attention to anatomy, Mensendieck gymnastics, history of dance, music, costumes and scenography, but covered the normal school curriculum with Danish, German, French, English, maths, geography and cultural history. Every two years the pupils displayed their skills, sometimes also appearing on the stages of Copenhagen and the provinces. For her attention to French language and culture, Mollerup was awarded the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques. The school continued to prosper, especially in the 1930s. Among its students were the actress Lilian Ellis, the dancers Bodil Genkel and Else Knipschildt, and the ballerina Nini Theilade. Asta Mollerup's niece Mette Mollerup (1931‚Äì1983) also attended the school. Asta Mollerup died in Copenhagen on 25 September 1945. She is buried in Taarb√¶k Cemetery.

It also criticizes funding for unemployed people and how politicians yell at each other and spent millions on military defense, while the average little man has to pay for all this.

He was born in Bloomsbury, London. He played Dr. Rogers in the 1913 film Riches and Rogues, and took the lead role of Dr. Thomas \\"Tom\\" Flynn in the 1914 comedy The Lucky Vest. After having worked on Charlie Chaplin films including Shanghaied and The Bank in 1915, he was hired by the Morosco Photoplay Company in 1916 as it expanded. Before and after working in silent films, Holland had a theatre career in the United Kingdom. His West End roles include Bella Donna, One-Act Plays, and Treasure Island. He also performed as the title character in the UK tour of Sherlock Holmes in 1919. As a playwright, he wrote the 1918 war play True Values, a propaganda piece encouraging women at home to work and invest in the war, and 1927 play The Big Drum, an early self-referential play set in a fictional theatre. Other works written by Holland include BW and Break the Sword. His later film career, in the United States, included work in the early silent Westerns, for which he was called \\"a silent star\\", and noted roles in various films dealing with foreign ethnicity, including two roles as Irish policemen who prevent organized crime by Chinese gangs.

His most notable works are his films depicting Alpine landscapes and his mountain-climbing expeditions in Europe between 1913 and 1918, his explorations of Borneo in 1920, and his excursions to various sites in the United States and Canada in the early 1920s. He was also an accomplished still photographer and book author, publishing in 1914 How to Become an Alpinist, which is illustrated with his photographs. Burlingham initially produced films while working in London for the British and Colonial Kinematograph Company, but he later developed his films independently and released them under contract with licensed distributors. Early life and journalism Born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1877, Frederick was the second of four children of William and Lillian (n√©e Brooks) Burlingham.\\"Tenth Census of the United States: 1880\\", Baltimore City, Maryland, June 9, 1880.

The federal census of 1880 documents that the Burlinghams were still living that year in Baltimore, where Frederick's father worked as a mechanic or, as identified in that record, a \\"Pump maker\\". Frederick's first jobs were as a grocery boy and a bookkeeper, and his musical talent as a pianist earned him a scholarship to Peabody Institute, a prestigious conservatory in Baltimore.Dench, Ernest A. \\"Taking Pictures in Extraordinary Places\\", Motion Picture Magazine, March 1915, p. 89.

By the late 1890s, Burlingham began to focus on a career in journalism, which afforded him opportunities to write and, more importantly, to travel. He relocated to New York City, where he worked for the Evening Post, Commercial Advertiser, the American, and The Evening World. Then, following brief stints as a reporter and editor with other newspapers in Virginia and West Virginia, he sailed to London in 1904.\\"Noted Explorer Here with Pictures\\", Motion Picture News, July 20, 1918, p. 438.

Finally, after years of working for an array of newspapers, Burlingham in 1912 turned away from traditional print media and decided to study cinematography, to use the motion-picture camera to record his travels and to share his experiences with audiences in a far more visual, dynamic way. Film career Burlingham's wife L√©ontine and their guide during ascent of Mont Blanc, 1913 Burlingham left Paris near the end of 1912 and returned to London, where he was soon hired by the British and Colonial Kinematograph Company. In 1913 the company assigned him to travel to Switzerland to film ski-jumping, curling, sleighing, and other Alpine winter sports around St. Moritz. Equipped with a bulky hand-cranked movie camera, a half-plate still camera, and a set of tripods, he also recorded his trek at higher elevations through deep snow at the Bernina Path, as well as ascents of the Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, and the Jungfrau. He continued from those sites to southern Italy, capturing additional scenic footage as he traveled to Mount Vesuvius. There he filmed on December 21, 1913 a deep descent into the volcano's interior. Burlingham and his three Italian assistants were nearly asphyxiated by sulphuric fumes as they used ropes to lower themselves down over 1200 feet \\"to the bottom of the cone\\".\\"Down Into Crater of Vesuvius\\" Reel Life (New York, N.Y.), January 24, 1914, p. 8.

In addition to releasing Burlingham's films The Ascent of the Matterhorn and Descent into the Crater of Vesuvius, the British and Colonial Company between the latter half of 1913 and August 1914 distributed to English cinemas 21 much shorter travelogues shot by him. Most of those short subjects, which averaged only about seven minutes in running time, consisted of tourist- style depictions of the countryside and resorts in southern France, Switzerland, and in the lake district of northern Italy. At the time British and Colonial hired him, Burlingham already had experience as a mountaineer. He had traveled to the Alps and was familiar with members of the French and Swiss mountain-climbing communities, which included his future wife L√©ontine, whom he met in Paris and married in London in 1912.\\"Services For Explorer\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, June 13, 1914, p. 16.

The widening armed conflict, however, continued to restrict and disrupt European travel outside the neutral territory of Switzerland, so he launched return-expeditions to the Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, the Jungfrau, and to other Alpine locations far removed from the war's effects. After the United States entered the war in April 1917, Burlingham returned to New York City by July 1918 with his personal film library of over 30,000 feet of master negatives from his European travels. In Manhattan he resumed his work as a producer of \\"educational\\" films, and he also registered there in September for American military service.\\"United States World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918\\", digital image of original United States document with handwritten entries by Frederick H.

Ink, the first book in the trilogy, was her debut novel. The publication rights were acquired by Scholastic UK for a three-book deal in early 2016. The books follow main protagonist, Leora Flint, who lives in a society where every significant moment, good or bad, is tattooed onto your skin and then preserved in a 'skin book' once you die. However, the blank community do not follow this practice, leaving their skin free of ink, which has caused a divide between the people of Saintstone and the blanks of Featherstone, and has resulted in a continued feud. When Leora uncovers secrets about her father, the blanks, and her true origin, the uneasy truce between the two societies is broken as the truths from both sides are unveiled. Leora and her allies wish for peace between Saintstone and Featherstone, while others within both communities wish for war and the destruction of the other. Broadway began writing the book in order to process her \\"crisis of faith\\" after leaving the evangelical community she and her family had been a part of due to feeling bullied and manipulated. She shares her sense of loss and idea of no longer belonging within a community after a lifetime of living by their rules with her main protagonist, Leora. Publication History The first book in the trilogy, Ink, was published in the UK in paperback and ebook on February 2, 2017 and published in the US in hardcover on January 2, 2018. The sequel Spark was published on April 5, 2018 in the UK and is due to published in July 2019 in the US. The final book in the trilogy, Scar, was published on April 4, 2019 in the UK and currently has no estimated release date in the US.  Synopsis  = Ink = In the first installment of the series, main protagonist Leora Flint lives in the town of Saintstone, where the residents mark their skin with important life events through the medium of tattoos. When a person dies, their skin is flayed and then, should the deceased be found worthy, preserved in a 'skin book' for remembrance. A tradition which has been passed down through generations, the marked community are taught that the purpose of inking their skin is to unburden their lives of secrets and deception, and after death they are flayed so they may live freely in the afterlife. Leora aspires to become an 'inker'; a professional tattoo artist. When Leora's father dies, she finds comfort thinking that his skin book will be kept and remembered, believing he had led a good life. But when she discovers that his book has been tampered with and a mark removed, she begins to question his legacy and seeks to learn the truth. With the help of her friends, Verity and Oscar, and her mentor Obel, Leora sets out to solve the mystery behind her father's edited skin book and clear his name. However, her investigations uncovers connections between her father, her own past, and the 'blanks'. The blanks live beyond the borders of Saintstone ‚Äì those who do not ink their skin and were banished from Saintstone's marked society. Their differences and 'otherness' have led to the belief that they are secretive and dangerous; a belief that has been encouraged by their government to inspire fear and disdain towards those who do not adhere to the marked way of life. Leora learns that the government are keeping her father's book, and with her friend's help she steals the page displaying the mark of the crow; a sign that indicating that a person should be Forgotten. However, Leora is betrayed and at the ceremonial weighing of her father's book she is told of her heritage; her father was disgraced and was inked with the crow for his connection with the blanks, and her mother was a blank woman. This shocks Leora so much she condemns her father's book to be burned, but later regrets her rash decision, and by Obel's hand she has herself marked with a crow. = Spark = After her defiance against the teachings of Saintstone and its government, Leora is presented with an opportunity only possible because of her mixed heritage. The government want to use her to infiltrate Featherstone, home to the blanks, so that they can be forever rid of them. However, Leora wishes to learn more about herself and her parents, and now no longer welcome among her own people and the mayor, Longsight, threatening her loved ones should she not comply with his demands, she is sent to earn the trust of the blanks. Her arrival at the blank settlement sparks a debate over her trustworthiness, and despite the promises she made to the mayor, she yearns for acceptance and the truth about her past. It is agreed that she may stay and, so long as she abides by their ways, and she stays with the Whitworth's ‚Äî whom she learns are Obel's family ‚Äî and befriends the daughter, Gull. As she spends time with the impoverished residents of Featherstone, she begins to see that they are not so different from the people back home; their stories are the same, but read from a different perspective. They hold the belief that sin can be washed away with a ceremonial baptism on the birthday of the younger inhabitants, and think that those who mark their skin are sinful. Distrust of one another's societies runs deep on both sides, with the blanks blaming the marked community for their misfortune. Leora learns how they were attacked and exiled, forced to live in poverty, and must send out parties in order to steal supplies from Saintstone in order to survive. Leora sneaks out for the first meeting with the mayor's contact, who turns out to be Verity ‚Äî her best friend who believes she was betrayed by Leora in the first book ‚Äî but after they argue decides to end any further communications. However the information that she did pass on leads to an unsuccessful raid, and Featherstone is left without enough food or medical supplies, sparking rage against the Saintstone. After the party have returned, Leora is introduced to Sana, unofficial leader of Featherstone and her late mother's best friend; Sana tells her a little about her mother and the past of Featherstone. Later, the arrival of her friend Oscar and his news of Obel's arrest trigger unrest, and Leora sets out to Saintstone with Sana and her crew to free Obel. However, when Leora returns she is intercepted by government official and Mayor Longsight's right-hand man, Jack Minnow, and escorted to the mayor. A town meeting is called in which Leora is to renounce the blanks, but before she takes the stage a hooded figure stabs Mayor Longsight, and in the confusion Leora escapes back to Featherstone. Upon her return, Leora confesses he previous agreement with Longsight, and is shunned by the majority of the blank community. She attends Gull's birthday ceremony from the outskirts, uninvited, but when Gull does not return to the surface of the lake, Leora pulls her out of the water to safety. After Gull has recovered a little, they return to find the water supply has been poisoned, with the marked being labelled as the culprits. Later, Leora and her friends make their way to Featherstone's elderhouse on a hunch, and Leora discovers the bloody knife used to stab Longsight. Sana arrives and confesses to the act, as well as starving the people, poisoning the water and more, to provoke the people of Featherstone into action against Saintstone. This leads to Leora and Gull leaving for Saintstone, but upon their arrival, they find Mayor Longsight alive and they are captured. =Scar= In the final installment of the series, Leora finds herself prisoner of the corrupt mayor of Saintstone, and must convince both sides of her honesty and intentions to unite the two communities, whilst exposing the truth and also trying to protect her loved ones, even when she doesn't know where they are, or if they would count her as friend or foe. The mayor appears to have performed miracles ‚Äî cheating death and tattoos disappearing from his skin ‚Äî but she and her mentor, Mel, set out to find the truth behind these acts with help from the stories of both communities. Leora, accompanied by Mel, travel to Featherstone in an attempt to broker peace between the two societies, but find that Sana has planned an attack on the marked. When they return to Saintstone the hall of remembrance ‚Äî where the marked community go to speak the names of those who have died ‚Äî is destroyed, and after Mel leaves for her home she is captured. Leora seeks out Jack Minnow for information and safety regarding her friends, but she is instead rejected by them. As she leaves, a crowd is forming in the square and the mayor brings Gull forward who has now been marked. The people of Saintstone do not perceive this as the act of unity it was intended to be, and Leora intercepts the mob and the guards to protect Gull. Leora is imprisoned and then later brought in front of the people, where Mayor Longsight intends to flay her alive; he removes one piece of her skin before he is stopped. Minnow then claims on the part of the mayor, and takes control over Saintstone, while Leora heals at home. After some time, a few members of Featherstone travel Leora's home for safety from Sana. After waking from a seemingly prophetic dream, Leora leaves her home for the museum ‚Äî now filled with the communities skin books after the attack on the hall of remembrance ‚Äî and finds a confrontation between Sana and Minnow. Sana hits Minnow with a lantern which in turn sets the museum on fire. Minnow attacks Leora and in the ensuing fight falls over a barrier and into the fire. Leora attempts to save the books and in her search for them finds Mel, who saves herself and Leora by jumping from a window. At the end of the book Mel is in charge of Saintstone and Leora is beginning to heal from her burns, as is the relationship between the blank and marked communities.  Themes  Religious Themes: One of the major themes of the books is the concept of faith and its effect on people's lives, after the author's own religious experiences. They also focus on the understanding of death and a sense of loss that changes between different beliefs, Broadway having taken inspiration from evangelical Christianity and ancient Egypt. The concepts of judgment, afterlife, and preservation are often presented with the marked's ceremonial weighing of the skin books and the blank's baptismal birthday ceremony. Social Themes: Another main focus of the books is the fear of 'otherness' and the unknown; the people of Saintstone have been taught to fear the blanks since childhood, while Featherstone have been taught to hate marked people. However, as Leora spends time with both societies, she learns they share many similarities and that it is the stories and lies told on both sides that keep them divided. Within both communities, there are those who see the views of the other, and who strive for acceptance and peace between the two people. Coming-of-age Themes: The book looks at two different issues within the coming-of-age bracket; challenging authority and self-expression. Throughout the series not everything is as it seems and characters must challenge their leaders, their teachings, and their own preconceptions to find the truth. There is also a focus on society's expectations on the looks and behaviour of the younger generation, from children to teens to young adults. This is most obviously demonstrated through the use of tattoos; Saintstone require all residents to mark their skin with important life events, while Featherstone was founded by those who refused to tattoo themselves and were banished. Fairytales and myths: Throughout the books there are references to myths and fairytales, such as Sleeping Beauty and Rapunzel. In an interview Broadway mentions how these well-known tales can be used and interpreted in different ways depending on the teller or the receiver, and she uses this idea of multiple interpretation ‚Äî the different societies' stories steming from the same place, the sisters Moriah and Belia, but manipulated to illustrate the ideals of those who are in charge ‚Äî to demonstrate the similarities between the two communities.  Characters  * Leora Flint: The main protagonist of the trilogy. Though raised in Saintstone amongst the marked community, she is the child of Miranda Flint, a blank woman, and Joel Flint originally Joe Elliot, a marked man.Raised by Sophie Flint. When she discovers that she was born already marked despite her blank heritage, she embarks on a journey that many consider to be her destiny; to bring the blanks and the marked together again. * Joel Flint: Leora's father, whose death acts as a catalyst for the events in the trilogy. Originally a resident of another local inked community, Riverton, he was sympathetic to the blanks and their suffering. After saving the life of a blank man, he was shunned by Riverton but welcomed into the Featherstone community where he met and fell in love with Miranda, Leora's birth mother. Upon Leora's birth, Joel entered Saintstone in order to protect and raise Leora in safety. * Verity Kohl: Leora's childhood best friend from Saintstone. Verity helps Leora in trying to clear her father's name as she works within the government, however she feels betrayed by Leora's growing sympathy and friendship with the blanks. * Oscar Drew: Leora's friend and love interest. After his father is publicly marked with the crow ‚Äî a symbol to show that his skin book will be burned and he will be forgotten ‚Äî he befriends Leora and encourages her relationship with the blank community-leading the two to become close. * Gull Whitworth: A new friend that Leora makes from the blank community of Featherstone. Gull is the younger sister of Obel, and struggles to fit in within blank society. She is intrigued by Leora's stories of Saintstone and the marked community. * Obel Whitworth: A local inker who acts as Leora's employer and teacher. Though he lives within Saintstone and is praised and revered for his artistic inking talents, he is secretly an exile from Featherstone. * Mel: The official story-teller of Saintstone and mentor to Leora. Chosen at childhood to carry the stories of Saintstone whilst forbidden to have a family of her own. Leora's conflicting feelings about the two communities and their histories challenge all that Mel has been brought up and taught to believe, and she begins to see the truth and the lies in both side's stories. * Mayor Longsight: The Mayor of Saintstone. Longsight preaches that the blanks intend to wage war upon Saintstone due their opposing beliefs, and that the only way to stop the coming war is to defeat the blanks first. * Jack Minnow: Righthand-man to Mayor Longsight. While he leads the investigation against Leora and blank sympathisers in book one, Leora tattoos Minnow and, in inking and reading his other marks, discovers his taste for violence.  Reception  Initial response to the series was generally positive, with the first book in the series, Ink, being shortlisted for several awards, including the Waterstones Children's Book Prize 2018, the Books Are My Bag Award, the Leeds Book Awards, the Trinity Schools Book Award, and within the top ten shortlist for the 2018 Federation of Children's Book Groups Children's Book Award. It was also longlisted for the 2018 CILIP Carnegie Medal, and within top twenty longlist for 2018 Branford Boase Award. It also achieved best-seller status for a debut novel in 2017. = Reviews = Elizabeth Finlayson with The School Librarian praises the author's use of \\"formal, reflective language\\" and the \\"moving\\" tone when addressing sensitive topics, though they also comments that it is a \\"longish read\\", with a suggested age range of between 16-19. Publishers Weekly comments on how the story explores loss and grief, and how Broadway shows power becoming \\"manipulative, controlling, and deceptive\\", although they express confusion about why the tattooing and flaying are they only way to remember someone. Their suggested reading age is 14+. An interview with The Guardian suggests some divided opinion over the books' use of flaying; the action making some readers \\"squeamish\\" and consider it to be too much for a YA novel, while others commend the edgy ideas and inclusion of tattoos. Kirkus Reviews praises Ink for introducing an intriguing and original dystopian premise, and \\"dramatic climax\\", though criticizes the ambiguous definitions regarding the two communities, and Leora's \\"vacillating\\" narrative voice. Their review of Spark again comments on the tone of narration and \\"inconsistent worldbuilding\\", but approves of the authors prosaic language for the in-world stories, \\"taut and suspenseful\\" pace, and again a dramatic ending. Goodreads figures show Ink to have an overall rating of 3.66 out of 5 stars, Spark having and overall average of 3.92, and Scar reaching an average of 4.01 stars. = Sales = Sales figures according to Nielsen BookScan indicate UK sales of over 29,000 between February 2017 and August 2018. Sales for the second and third books in the series are lower, Spark reaching 6,875 sales between April 2018-2019, and Scar totalling 1,722 between its publication date in April and May 2019.  Translations and International Release  In advance of Ink's UK publication, Scholastic sold the rights to the first book in the series in Australia, France, Italy, Latin America, The Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and the US. Further translations have been made since, with more alternative book covers being produced for Lithuania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Mexico.

The main objective of the Academy is to be the authoritative voice of microbiology in Europe and thus enhance the potential of microbiology and microbiologists in Europe and globally . The Federation of European Microbiology Societies (FEMS) founded and supports the EAM, and many EAM members collaborate with FEMS in various capacities (e.g. directors, editors in chief of FEMS journals, etc.).  Origins  The idea of establishing an ‚ÄúAcademy‚Äù of senior microbiologists within Europe, aimed to be an advisory source both for the Federation and governmental/other bodies, was strongly supported by FEMS executives. For this purpose, an ad-hoc committee for the admission of new member societies was set up to discuss and support this initiative, that was brought to the attention of the FEMS Council in 2007. The European Academy of Microbiology was established in June 2009 in Gothenburg (Sweden), with the goal of promoting excellence in microbiology across Europe.  Members  The members of the European Academy of Microbiology are experts in microbiology with a notable record of publications, patents or inventions and important results and contributions to the microbiological community. The recruitment process is highly selective and based on a peer-review evaluation by the current members to uphold the high scientific standards of the EAM. Members of the EAM include Cecilia Arraiano, Fr√©d√©ric Barras, Melanie Blokesch, Emmanuelle Charpentier, Petra Dersch, Alain Filloux, Geoff Gadd, David Holden, Stipan Jonjiƒá, Hilary Lappin-Scott, Tracy Palmer, Philippe Sansonetti, Geoffrey L Smith, Victor Sourjik and many more prominent microbiologists .  Activities  In collaboration with other institutions and societies (e.g. FEMS) the Academy is involved in: * the organization of high standard meetings and colloquia to discuss critical issues in microbiology; * the publication of recommendations on critical issues in microbiology; * the promotion of microbiology education; * the establishment of special awards/prizes for microbiological achievements; * supporting FEMS activities. Examples of recent EAM activities are the 2011 meeting ‚ÄòEHEC infection and control‚Äô following the European outbreak of the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strain O104:H4, which was attended by world renowned experts in pathogenic E. coli and resulted in an authoritative case report. In May 2019, EAM and FEMS organized at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, a tribute to the life and work of Stanley Falkow (1934-2018) the founder of molecular microbial pathogenesis.

In 1978, Chamberlin scored 10 tries in 19 games as Cronulla finished 2nd on the table and qualified for the finals. Cronulla defeated Manly in the opening week of the finals series 17-12. Cronulla then defeated minor premiers Western Suburbs to reach their second grand final against Manly. In the Grand Final, Chamberlin played at centre partnering Steve Rogers as Cronulla went to a 9-4 lead in the second half before Manly came back to hit the front 11-9. A Steve Rogers penalty squared it at 11-all but he then missed a desperate late field- goal attempt and at full-time the scores remained locked. Just 3 days later, Cronulla and Manly were required to contest a grand final replay to declare a winner as the Australian team had been announced the same week and were heading to England. Both Manly and Cronulla went into the replay with tired players but it was Manly who prevailed in the replay 16-0 winning their fourth premiership in front of a low crowd of 33,552.

The bell tower, carved pews and the de Tracy tomb (see below) are medieval. The chancel-arch mosaic and the 'archangel' window were designed by Selwyn Image. The later parts of the building are of the 14th and 16th centuries.

Wrang joined the Waffen-SS in 1939 but deserted and instead fought the Soviets in Finland during the Winter War. Wrang also participated in the Continuation War and saw action in the Battle of Hanko. After the war, Wrang re-entered the Swedish Army and was placed in the reserve in 1946. He worked as a factory manager for a few years, before resuming his military career. Wrang served as commanding officer of the Swedish Army Paratroop School in the late-1950s and served as a UN observer in Kashmir and with the Swedish battalions during the Congo Crisis and during the Cyprus dispute in the 1960s. He retired in 1977. Career Wrang was born in Liding√∂, Sweden, the son of lieutenant colonel Ragnar Vrang and his wife Hild (n√©e Stenhammar). Wrang passed studentexamen in G√§vle in 1936 and was commissioned as an officer in H√§lsinge Regiment (I 14) with the rank of f√§nrik in 1939. Wrang joined the Waffen-SS in 1939 but never experienced active service. Instead he deserted from his unit in order to cross the Norwegian frontier. His intention, however, was not SS service. In 1939 he applied to the French Army, as he felt war between France and Germany was imminent. Foreign service being limited to the French Legion, he remained in Sweden. Instead, Wrang joined the Finnish Army during the Winter War and was promoted to f√§nrik and took part in the battle of M√§rk√§j√§rvi. Returning to Sweden in April 1940, he re-entered the Swedish Army for fear that his country would share the fate of Norway and Denmark. Then invasion not materialising, he applied to joint British forces fighting the Italians in Greece. He was, much to his consternation, denied a travel permit. The reason for his subsequent desertion was he hoped to find his way to Finland via Norway. The only way to do this was to enlist in the SS. To this he readily agreed. Flown via Copenhagen to Berlin, he was persuaded to remain in SS service despite a complete lack of interest. On discovering a Finnish volunteer battalion was being raised, he applied for an immediate transfer to the unit's base at Stralsund training camp, which was granted. Promoted to Obersturmf√ºhrer on arrival, his application for transfer to Finland was granted following the discovery that the volunteers would be deployed in the Ukraine. He then served with the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS of the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking for several weeks in 1941. Wrang subsequently joined the Swedish Volunteer Battalion on the Hanko Front during the Continuation War and saw action in the Battle of Hanko in 1941. One who opposed his discharge was SS recruitment manager Gottlob Berger, who felt the decision should be challenged as Wrang could be useful for \\"future work\\" in Sweden centering on recruitment. In 1941, he was promoted to lieutenant in the Finnish Army. Returning home following his service, he rejoined the Swedish Army and was promoted to lieutenant there as well. Wrang was transferred to the reserve as lieutenant in 1946, where he became captain in 1947. Wrang worked as a factory manager at SMS-industri AB from 1946 to 1953. In 1953, he was appointed captain in the Svea Life Guards (I 1) and from 1954 to 1956 he attended the Royal Swedish Army Staff College. He then served as commanding officer of the Swedish Army Paratroop School from 1957 to 1959 when he transferred to North Scanian Infantry Regiment (I 6) where he served as major. Wrang served as a UN observer in Kashmir from 1961 to 1962 and then in the Congo, part of the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) in 1963. In 1964, Wrang served in Cyprus, part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). Wrang retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1977. Personal life In 1942 he married Karin Gustafsson (born 1917), the daughter of Rulle Gustafsson and Maria S√∂derstedt. They had three children; Peter (born 1943), Stefan (born 1947) and Margareta (born 1952). He was a member of the Swedish Order of Freemasons. Wrang died on 18 September 1998 in Vallentuna.

The game has many editions that were released during that time including some that feature special events or airports like the former Kai Tak International Airport in Hong Kong or Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa. It is the third version of the Air Traffic Controller series of simulations.  Gameplay  The objective of each level is the reach a required number of points to pass while avoiding many of the dangers of being an air traffic controller. There are many reasons that can cause a game over for the stage, including a near miss, head-ons during take-off or taxiing, or having enough points to pass the level. Players must also avoid making the stress level for aircraft go up, which results in a game over if it reaches 100%. Players must also direct aircraft on to the runway direction facing into the wind, or else the aircraft will do a automatic go-around on the captain's decisions. In some games, players are able to control traffic from other airports. At the end of every is a cutscene with a different version of the game's opening theme.

CHIRP (Continuous High- resolution Image Reconstruction using Patch priors) is a Bayesian algorithm used to perform a deconvolution on images created in radio astronomy. The acronym was coined by lead author Katherine L. Bouman in 2016. The development of CHIRP involved a large team of researchers from MIT‚Äôs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the MIT Haystack Observatory, including Bill Freeman and Sheperd Doeleman. It was first presented publicly by Bouman at the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in June 2016.  Development  The CHIRP algorithm was developed to process data collected by the very-long-baseline Event Horizon Telescope, the international collaboration that in 2019 captured the black hole image of M87* for the first time. CHIRP was not used to produce the image, but was an algebraic solution for the extraction of information from radio signals producing data by an array of radio telescopes scattered around the globe. Stable sources (that don't change over short periods of time) can also gain signal by integrating the change at each location with the rotation of the earth. Because the radio telescopes used in the project produce vast amounts of data, which contain gaps, the CHIRP algorithm is one of the ways to fill the gaps in the collected data.  Evaluation For reconstruction of such images which have sparse frequency measurements the CHIRP algorithm tends to outperform CLEAN, BSMEM (BiSpectrum Maximum Entropy Method), and SQUEEZE, especially for datasets with lower signal-to-noise ratios and for reconstructing images of extended sources. While the BSMEM and SQUEEZE algorithms may perform better with hand- tuned parameters, tests show CHIRP can do better with less user expertise.

He became the CEO in 2014, after spending over 15 years with the company. Eilam played an influential part in evolving the strategic direction of the company, leading its transition into an enterprise software company. This was done through the sale of a number of subsidiaries to create a cloud and analytics focus. This was achieved through organic developments as well as acquisitions of a number of businesses based in the United States. Eilam's acquisition strategy has led the share price of NICE Ltd. to rise substantially between 2014 and the present day. While CEO of NICE Ltd., Eilam has won multiple awards for his achievements including some in his country of birth, Israel. Education and early life Eilam studied at the Tel Aviv University, where he received a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. He also attended INSEAD Management in France. Career Early in Eilam's career, he joined NICE Ltd. and later became Vice President of the Interaction Analytics Group, an extension of NICE. He later moved to the United States and became Head of Sales and the General Manager for the company's Enterprise Group in the Americas. He served as President of NICE Americas, where he focused on expanding the customer base and regional reach of the company throughout the Americas. Eilam was announced as the CEO in 2014. He replaced Zeevi Bregman, who retired from the post. Following the announcement, David Kustman as Chairman of the Board stated, \\"Barak has proven success in establishing business units and achieving results, and has made a significant contribution to NICE's growth and success. During his career he has demonstrated a high ability to lead organizations, including product and sales teams, to introduce new technologies and foster innovation. His appointment points to the depth of the managerial avenue at NICE. I am confident that he is the right person to motivate NICE to realize the many opportunities in the market and to lead the company to continued growth in the coming years.\\" When Eilam was announced as the CEO, many Israeli newspapers stated that NICE Ltd. was one of the largest Israeli companies to be floated on the NASDAQ. Eilam underwent a restructuring operation of the company, which led to selling various services and making a number of new acquisitions. In 2015, the company sold a number of intelligence related services for $158 million to the firm Elbit Systems. along with physical security division for $100 million. This led the company to acquire a number of companies, mainly based in the United States. This included the cloud-based customer service provider, inContact, based in Utah. The acquisition was the largest in the history of NICE Ltd. and completely repositioned the company. According to Fortune it allowed the company to focus more on mid-market, but also on large financial companies to integrate their existing product range. The acquisition was for a total of $940 million. They also acquired analytics firm Nexidia for $135 million during a similar period. This was seen by many in the media as Eilam further repositioning the company into the customer interaction analytics market. In late 2017, the company also announced the acquisition of workforce analytical software provider, WorkFlex. Previous acquisitions such as Causata enabled NICE Ltd. to have a diversified portfolio of analytical products. The ongoing acquisitions and strategic realignment meant the stock price of the company also grew by 27% between 2017 and 2018. In 2018, it was rumored that Eilam and NICE Ltd. were considering an acquisition offer for Mattersight Corporation. The deal was eventually completed later that year for a total of $90 million. The company which was a SaaS-based enterprise behavioral analytics software provider, became a subsidiary product offering of NICE Ltd. following the acquisition. During the same year, NICE Ltd. and Eilam posted a number of positive results regarding company growth. These results were mainly focused on two products, CXone and X-Sight. Following the launch of CXone, the cloud business arm of the company grew its revenues by 29% during Q4 of 2018. During an earnings call, Eilam explained how X-Sight was growing in stature within the financial crime market. During this year, Eilam also oversaw the integration of IFM-X into X-Sight, which would give clients an integrated fraud management suite, using machine learning to reduce the cost of operating a fraud management system. Since becoming the CEO of NICE Ltd., the company has regularly posted strong financial results. In the third quarter of 2018, it was announced that the financials were better than expected for the quarter. Cash held by the company reduced following the acquisition of Mattersight, but reached a market cap of $6.6 billion by the end of 2018, following a 25.5% rise in share price over the previous twelve months. This coincided with overall growth in revenue of 9% over the entire year. Towards the end of 2018, Eilam was interviewed on CNBC, speaking about the success of NICE Ltd. and the growth it has experienced over recent years. Eilam stated that since he had become CEO, the company had experienced a fivefold growth in a little over four years at the helm of the company. Eilam outlined a strategy on how NICE Ltd. would further expand in the coming years. He believed that by increasing the quality of analytics across all sectors of the business, for both internal and customer requirements, it would create more efficient software. He expected NICE Ltd. to reach a turnover of $2 billion in a short timeframe, with an operating margin of 30%.

Personal life  Hartfield was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a white Jewish father and a black mother and has three sisters. At 10, she was chosen to dance with the Russian Bolshoi ballet company while they were vising Chicago and later became a member of the Yaledancers in college, the oldest group of ballet dancers at Yale University. Despite being a writer focusing on historical events now, Hartfield says that she never really enjoyed history class in school, because she found that the texts they read were unrelatable and unapplicable to her life. It wasn't until college, when attended an anti-apartheid rally with her friends and read a book about the life of South African anti-apartheid activist Steven Biko, that she developed an interest in history. She graduated with a B.A. degree from Yale College and a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School. Hartfield has three children, all daughters, named Emily, Caroline, and Corinne.  Selected works  Hartfield's non-fiction novel A Few Red Drops: The Chicago Race Riot of 1919, tells the story of the 1919 Chicago Race Riots that killed 38 people and wounded 537, two thirds of which were black victims. Hartfield first heard of the Chicago Race Riots through her grandmother, who lived through them and found herself in the middle of the riots at twenty years old when stepping out of her home in summer 1919. A few years prior to writing the book, she was again reminded of her grandmother's story when she saw the way police were interacting with protestors in the United States and wrote A Few Red Drops with the goal in mind to inspire coming generations to figure out a way to bring about change. The novel's title was inspired by a line in the Carl Sandberg poem \\"I Am the People, the Mob,\\" published in 1916, which reads \\"Sometimes I growl, shake myself and spatter a few red drops for history to remember.‚Äù Hartfield encountered the poem well into writing the novel while researching poems from the early 20th century and found that it summed up the message of her story perfectly.

Biography  Kulundzic was originally trained as an architect and graduated from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris (Paris National Fine Arts School) in 1998. In 2012, he was awarded the Claude Berthault prize. He has taught at the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d‚ÄôArchitecture of Paris Val- de-Seine, at Paris-Sud University, at Honolulu Museum of Art School and he now teaches classical drawing at Hawaii University.  Work  In 2012, Kosta Kulundzic founded the Under Realist movement with Serbian artist Vuk Vidor and French artist Stephan Pencr√©ac‚Äôh. The movement was created as a reaction against the over-conceptualisation of contemporary painting : for them, the image is more important than the idea. The Under Realism is a grouping of artists who share the same vision of the artist's condition and are trying to free themselves from the diktats of markets and trends. Kosta Kulundzic is the grandson of an orthodox pope, and in his work he builds parallels between religious texts and the violence of contemporary society. He stages a carnivalesque reversal of values, an depicts a world in which women took power over men and perform the most ghastly of crimes in a playful atmosphere. Kosta Kulundzic has shown that he was a committed artist on several occasions. For instance he sketched the hearings of the trial between Trump and the State of Hawaii in 2017. He has shown his work in (Germany), Belgium, Bosnia, China; Croatia, United States, Italy, Morocco, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland or Turkey. In 2018, Kosta Kulundizc was selected for an artistic project and asked to paint two in situ frescoes in the car park of the Royal Hamilius, in Luxembourg, a building designed by the architect Sir Norman Foster. Artists Doroth√©e Louise Recker, Lise Stoufflet, Ga√´tan Henrioux, Axel Sanson and Valentina Canseco also participated in the project.

At an age of nine months, Khan was mistakenly shot by his father. Although the bullet passed through his right lung and stomach, he survived. Ascending to the throne after his father's removal from power, he chose to accede to the Dominion of Pakistan in the same year and was invested with full powers by Liaquat Ali Khan in 1951. Three years later, the state merged with Pakistan, removing Khan's sovereign status. Khan fathered two sons, Abbas Raza Khan and Mehdi Raza Khan and one daughter Zahra from his second wife. Early life Khan was born on 29 June 1933 at Brighton, Sussex in United Kingdom to Mir Faiz Muhammad Khan II and Dulhan Pasha Begum. He studied at St Bonaventure's High School in Hyderabad followed by Aitchison College, Lahore, before graduating from the University of Cambridge. At an age of nine months, Khan was mistakenly shot by his father. Although the bullet passed through his right lung and stomach, he survived. Reign Khan's father Faiz Muhammad Khan II was deposed by the British on 19 July 1947, due to being declared mentally unfit. On 24 July, he ascended the throne at Faiz Mahal but a regency board, consisting of his close relatives was created to govern the state on his behalf, as he was a minor. During Khan's reign, Khairpur spanned over with a population of around 300,000 and a substantial part of the Lahore-Karachi railway track was within the state, thus making it a high-value territory for the newly formed Pakistan. On 4 August 1947, the state government issued a notification declaring that 15 August would be celebrated as the state's independence day and finally after rounds of negotiation, on 3 October, Mir Ghulam Hussain Khan‚Äîone of the regents, signed the instrument of accession on behalf of Khan acceding the state to the Dominion of Pakistan. A supplementary instrument signed on 1 February 1949 considerably reduced the effective powers of Khan and the Durbar and not only took control of the armed forces but also bound the chief-minister to be appointed only after consultation with the national government. The Government of Khairpur Act, 1949 was subsequently passed which initiated for quasi-democratic reforms and established a 15-member legislative assembly composed of local representatives. It thus became one of the two states (the other one being Bahwalpur) of Pakistan, where universal adult franchise was enabled for the first time. But, democratic ideals failed to develop, given that the proceedings of the assembly were allowed to be veto-able by the Chief-minister and additionally, the Chief Minister was granted absolute authority to promulgate laws without the consent of the assembly. In 1951, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan investitured an 18 year old Khan with absolute ruling powers and disbanded the regents-council. The Government of Khairpur Act was soon passed in 1953 despite strong reservations of Khan, converting Khairpur into a province and consolidating further powers in the hands of centrally appointed chief-minister. On 25 May 1954, the assembly passed a resolution that rejected proposals of being merged with Sindh. Finally, on 10 November 1954, the state assembly was somewhat compelled to pass a resolution to absolutely merge with the Dominion of Pakistan and remove Khan's claim to any minimal extent of sovereignty. Personal life Khan's first wife was Ghulam Saddiquah Begum, the daughter of Nawab Sadeq Mohammad Khan V of Bahawalpur State, whom he married at the Sadiqgarh Palace in Bahawalpur. His second wife was Alya Talpur, a daughter of religious scholar Rasheed Turabi. She died on 8 February 2019.

Kennell (January 9, 1922 ‚Äì August 29, 2013) was a doctor of pediatrics and researcher known for his work in maternal bonding during childbirth and support of doulas.  Biography  John Hawks Kennell was born on January 9, 1922 in Reading, Pennsylvania to Doris Hawks and Carlyle Kennell. He grew up in Buffalo, New York and was valedictorian of Bennett High School. He attended medical school at the University of Rochester receiving his M.D. in 1946. He completed his residency at Harvard Medical School after a stint in the Navy. After his residency, he became chief resident at Boston Children's Hospital. In 1952, Kennell moved to Cleveland as attending pediatrician in the neonatal unit of Case Western Reserve University Hospital. In this role, Kennell noticed how babies were being separated from their mothers promptly after birth and in the 1960s began researching how mothers bond with their babies along with Dr. Marshall H. Klaus. In 1976, the pair published ‚ÄúMaternal-Infant Bonding‚Äù which claimed that in the first few hours of birth, mothers and their infants were hormonally primed to form crucial bonds as a survival technique. These bonds created in the first few hours were said to improve mothering, increase the likelihood of breastfeeding, enhance child development, and decrease chide abuse. The research came under criticism with opponents citing the inherent problems studying human behavior and claiming that the improved bonding effect is small and limited. Kennell and Klaus republished the book with a new title, \\"Parent-Infant Bonding\\" in 1982 which acknowledged their mistakes and weren't as specific about the bonding timetable as in the previous version. This research led to many hospitals to change their procedures to give new parents time with their infants, allow partners in the delivery room, and the baby's siblings to visit. Kennell later became interested in the bonding of parents whose infants died in delivery or soon after being born. This research led him to recommend parents hold their deceased infants. In 1984, he was awarded the C. Anderson Aldrich Award from the American Academy of Pediatrics. During Kennell's studies of maternal- infant bonding in the 1980s, he also noticed shorter labors when a female research assistant supported the women during delivery. The study \\"Effects of social support during parturition on maternal and infant morbidity\\" with Klaus, Steven Robertson, and Roberto Sosa demonstrated that trained labor companions, often known as doulas, reduces labor time, perinatal complications, and the need for medication and cesarean delivery.

A Steve Rogers penalty squared it at 11-all but he then missed a desperate late field-goal attempt and at full-time the scores remained locked in front of 51,000 fans.

Santmyers (September 15, 1889 ‚Äì December 26, 1960) was an American architect who practiced in Washington, D.C. for fifty years, beginning in 1909; he was one of the city's most prolific and important architects of the twentieth century. While Santmyers is credited with the design of a variety of commercial buildings, banks, churches, public garages, and thousands of single-family residences, he is most celebrated for his contribution to apartment building architecture, working in most areas of the nation‚Äôs capital. As the architect of over 440 apartment buildings in the course of his long career, Santmyers devoted his skills and energy to producing notably- designed buildings with efficient plans. Most of his work was for the city‚Äôs commercial property developers, doing speculative structures. His ability to craft distinctive creations within a variety of budgets has given the city a fine legacy of buildings. Santmyers was born in Front Royal, Virginia on September 15, 1889, and spent his early years in Baltimore, Maryland. He moved to Washington as a teenager, completed high school and then studied architecture at the Washington Architecture Club Atelier from 1908 to 1912. He had several years of training through apprenticeship in the offices of local architects. In 1913, he married Dorothy Featherstone. Santmyers' name first appears on a building permit in 1909, and by 1914, at age twenty-five, he had opened his own architectural office. The work produced by his office far outstripped that of any other Washington, D.C., architect. The D.C. permit database credits Santmyers with designing more than 16,000 buildings, many times more than the next-busiest architects in the city. In 1960, still designing and running his office, he completed his last apartment building design at the age of 72, just six months before his death. He died in Wheaton, Maryland on December 26, 1960. 3901 Connecticut Avenue, NW. A six-story Tudor Revival apartment building, designed by George T. Santmyers in 1927. His work included a range of styles, from Tudor Revival to Gothic to Colonial Revival; and as the Art Deco style became popular, he created some memorable apartment buildings in that motif.Best Addresses, by James M. Goode (Smithsonian Books, 1988), p. 378, Two of the more prominent buildings that he designed are: 3901 Connecticut Avenue, NW (1927); and 2101 Connecticut Avenue, NW (1929), where he was assisted by Joseph Abel. The imposing brick structure of \\"2101\\" is now a co-op, and is considered to be one of the finest apartment houses in the city. Both of these are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Santmyers created many other exceptional apartments houses, most often in the Northwest areas of Washington; and several of these have also been historically registered. For instance, Meridian Manor, built in 1926 in the Colonial Revival style, and located in the Columbia Heights neighborhood, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. A large number of his other works were standard residential structures, usually brick; many were rowhouses. Today, numerous, and diverse, blocks that make up the basic background landscape of the city of Washington are composed of buildings designed by George T. Santmyers.

G. Wells. It is the second installment in Universal's Dark Universe franchise. It follows a woman who believes she is being stalked by her abusive and wealthy boyfriend even after his apparent suicide, and ultimately deduces that he has acquired the ability to become invisible. The film stars Elisabeth Moss, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Harriet Dyer, Michael Dorman, and Oliver Jackson-Cohen. It is an international co-production of the United States and Australia. The development of a new film based on Wells's 1897 novel began as early as 2006. The project was revived as part of Universal's shared cinematic universe in 2016, intended to consist of their classic monsters, with Johnny Depp attached to star in the title role. After The Mummy was released in 2017 to critical and financial failure, development was halted on all projects. In early 2019, the studio changed their plans from a serialized universe to films based on individualized story-telling and the project reentered development. Principal photography lasted from July to September 2019 in Sydney, Australia. The Invisible Man was released in the United States on February 28, 2020, by Universal Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Moss' performance, its inventive modernization of the novel's plot, and the combination of scares with \\"a smart narrative about how people can be manipulated and abused in harmful relationships\\". The film grossed $134 million worldwide against a $7 million budget and became the tenth highest- grossing film of 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing theaters across the world, Universal announced the film would be made available for digital rental just four weeks after it was released theatrically.  Plot  Cecilia Kass is trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman Adrian Griffin. One night, Cecilia drugs Adrian with diazepam, and escapes his highly-secured home, assisted by her sister, Emily. Cecilia hides out with acquaintance Detective James Lanier and his teenage daughter, Sydney. Two weeks after Cecilia‚Äôs escape, Adrian seemingly commits suicide and leaves her $5 million in his trust. His lawyer brother, Tom, handles the arrangements. Cecilia suspects another presence in the house after several strange events and calls James, but he assures her she is just traumatized. During a job interview, she finds her work portfolio's contents removed, then faints. The doctor says high levels of diazepam were found in her system. In her bathroom, she finds the same bottle of diazepam with which she drugged Adrian, and dropped, during her escape. Cecilia, accompanied by James, arranges a meeting with Tom. She believes that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but this idea is rebuffed. Later, Sydney is hit by an unseen force, and she and James assume Cecilia did it. Alone at the house, Cecilia tries various tactics to catch the figure. After finding Adrian's old phone and dumping paint on the figure, a violent struggle ensues before she escapes. She goes to Adrian's home to investigate his lab. There, she finds an optical body suit, confirming her suspicions. However, the invisible figure attacks again, so she flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet in a restaurant, but the invisible figure slits Emily's throat and places the knife in Cecilia's hand, framing her for murder. While awaiting trial, Cecilia is remanded to a mental hospital, where she learns she is pregnant. Tom offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to \\"return to him\\" and raise the child, implying that Tom helped stage his brother's fake suicide. He reveals Adrian tampered with her birth control to impregnate her. Cecilia refuses the offer and steals a pen from his briefcase. That night, she attempts to commit suicide. When the invisible figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly with the pen, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrives, but the figure incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital, with Cecilia in pursuit. To protect her unborn child, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves. Cecilia races to James' house and finds the figure attacking him and Sydney. She shoots the figure to death, but when unmasked, she finds Tom in the suit. Police storm Adrian's house and find him alive, tied up and claiming Tom held him prisoner. Cecilia insists the brothers shared the suit, with Adrian sending Tom to the house knowing he would be killed. To get Adrian's confession, she meets him at his house while James listens on a wire. She agrees to mend their relationship, but only if he confesses to being the figure. Adrian insists that Tom did kidnap him and claims the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her. When she cries, Adrian alludes to his abuse, using similar phrasing to that of the figure. Satisfied, Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the security camera captures Adrian seemingly slitting his own throat. Cecilia returns and, apparently distraught, calls the police. Out of the camera's sight, however, she taunts a dying Adrian, revealing to him that she actually retrieved the spare suit she had hidden in the house, with the intention to kill him once and for all. A horrified Adrian then dies, knowing that Cecilia had outsmarted him and he has now lost everything; his control over Cecilia and her unborn child, his millions, and now his life. When James arrives, she confirms what the camera captured. He notices her carrying the suit, but allows her to leave. Relieved she is free of Adrian forever, Cecilia leaves, taking the suit with her. Cast * Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass * Aldis Hodge as James Lanier, a San Francisco police detective, Sydney's father and Cecilia's friend * Storm Reid as Sydney Lanier, James' teenage daughter * Harriet Dyer as Emily Kass, Cecilia's sister * Michael Dorman as Tom Griffin, Adrian's brother and lawyer * Oliver Jackson- Cohen as Adrian Griffin * Benedict Hardie as Marc * Amali Golden as Annie * Sam Smith as Detective Reckley * Nash Edgerton as a Security Guard * Anthony Brandon Wong as Accident Victim Production Development of a new The Invisible Man film began as early as 2006 when David S. Goyer was hired to write the screenplay. Goyer remained attached to the project as late as 2011, with little to no further development on the film. In February 2016, the project was revived with Johnny Depp cast as the titular character and Ed Solomon writing the screenplay. It was revealed to be part of an intended cinematic universe featuring Universal Pictures' modern-day reboot of their classic monsters. The would-be film series was set to begin in 2017 with The Mummy, starring Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, and Russell Crowe, followed by a remake of The Bride of Frankenstein in 2019. An image released in May 2017 of Depp with Cruise, Boutella, Crowe, and Javier Bardem, who was cast to play Frankenstein's monster, announced this shared world as the Dark Universe. The Mummy director Alex Kurtzman stated that fans should expect at least one film per year from the series. However, once The Mummy was released to negative critical reception and box office returns deemed by the studio as insufficient, changes were made to the Dark Universe to focus on individual storytelling and move away from the shared universe concept.  In January 2019, Universal announced that all future movies on their horror characters would focus on standalone stories, avoiding inter-connectivity.‚ÄòInvisible Man‚Äô Finds Director, Sets New Course for Universal‚Äôs Monster Legacy (EXCLUSIVE) Successful horror film producer Jason Blum, founder of production company Blumhouse Productions, had at various times publicly expressed his interest in reviving and working on future installments within the Dark Universe films. The Invisible Man was set to be written and directed by Leigh Whannell, and produced by Blum, but would not star Depp as previously reported. In March 2019, Elisabeth Moss entered early negotiations to star, with her official casting the following month. Storm Reid, Aldis Hodge, and Harriet Dyer later joined the cast,  with Oliver Jackson-Cohen set to play the titular role in July. Principal photography began on July 16, 2019 and ended on September 17, 2019 in Sydney, Australia. On February 22, 2020, during an interview with Cinemablend's ReelBlend Podcast, Whannell stated that the film was never planned to be part of any cinematic universe, including the Dark Universe. He stated, Benjamin Wallfisch composed the music for the film. Back Lot Music has released the soundtrack. Release The Invisible Man was theatrically released in the United States on February 28, 2020 by Universal Pictures. It was originally scheduled for release on March 13, 2020, but in August 2019 was moved up two weeks. On March 16, 2020 Universal Pictures announced that the film would be released digitally in the United States and Canada through Premium VOD on March 20, just three weeks after the film's theatrical debut and before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run. This was because of movie theater closures that started in mid March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Other films distributed by the studio, such as The Hunt and Trolls World Tour, were also released earlier than expected for the same reason. As pandemic restrictions were loosened, the film was released in three Santikos Theatres locations in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020. Reception =Box office= The Invisible Man grossed $64.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $69.8 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $134.7 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $24‚Äì30 million from 3,610 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $9.8 million on its first day, including $1.65 million from Thursday night previews. The film went on to debut to $28.9 million, topping the box office. The film made $15.1 million in its second weekend (dropping 46%) and then $5.9 million in its third weekend. In the film's fourth weekend, due to the mass theater closures around the country caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it made $64,000 from 111 locations, mostly drive-in theaters. The film continued to play almost exclusively at drive-ins in the following weeks; it made $444,000 in its 13th weekend, $320,800 in its 14th, and $209,000 in its 15th. The film reclaimed the top spot atop the box office in its 16th weekend, making $383,000 from 187 theaters. =Critical response= Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 91% of 388 reviews of the film were positive, with an average rating of 7.71/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Smart, well-acted, and above all scary, The Invisible Man proves that sometimes, the classic source material for a fresh reboot can be hiding in plain sight.\\" Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 58 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an overall positive score of 76% and an average four out of five stars, with 53% of people they polled saying they would definitely recommend the film. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Moss's performance \\"gives the movie its emotional stakes,\\" adding, \\"while her agony can be unnerving, it is even more shivery when her weeping stops and this horror-movie damsel in distress becomes a threat.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Jesse Hassenger gave the film a \\"B+\\", also praising Moss's performance and the film's centering of her character's experience; the publication followed up with a video review from senior writer Katie Rife and Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who also gave a positive review, for the aesthetic and filmmaking of Blumhouse Productions and Moss's performance. Alison Willmore of Vulture commented about the effectiveness of Moss's facial expressions, and said that she \\"has established herself as an empress of the onscreen breakdown, our lady of ruined eye makeup\\". Patrick Cavanaugh of ComicBook.com gave the film four out of five stars, and wrote that Whannell's film is \\"an experience that is both effective as a full-blown horror film and as a chilling reminder of the abuse one can suffer from a supposed loved one.\\" Conversely, Nicholas Barber from BBC gave the film two out of five stars, opining that \\"the latest remake of the HG Wells tale offers a timely feminist spin ‚Äì but it's lacking in thrills.\\" He criticized the film's vagueness, concluding, \\"at a time when small-scale horror movies can be as stunning as A Quiet Place and Get Out, a film as perfunctory as The Invisible Man feels insulting.\\" Jake Coyle of the Associated Press was also less than positive, describing it as \\" a bracingly modern #MeToo allegory that, despite its brutal craft, rings hollow.\\" Future * The Invisible Woman: In November 2019, it was announced that a spin-off film centered around the female counterpart to Invisible Man was in development. Elizabeth Banks was set to star in, direct, and produce a new adaptation of The Invisible Woman (1940), based on her own original story pitch. Erin Cressida Wilson will write the script for the reboot of the female monster, while Max Handelman and Alison Small will serve as producer and executive producer, respectively. Banks was allowed to choose a project by Universal Pictures from the roster of Universal Classic Monsters, ultimately choosing The Invisible Woman. * Untitled sequel: In February 2020, after the release of the first film, Whannell and Moss stated that the movie was standalone with a definitive ending. Whannell explained that once the movie is released, and some time passes he may consider working on a follow-up film.https://www.etonline.com/the-invisible-man-elisabeth-moss-weighs-in-on- that-ending-and-a-potential-sequel-exclusive-142208 In May, Whannell and Blum stated that discussions regarding a sequel were ongoing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uogq-LSMRPE By June when asked about a sequel, Moss stated: \\"Look, if people want it that's kind of a big part of what we need in order to do it.

Early life  Miloslav Masopust was born on September 26th, 1924 in ƒåesk√Ω Straklov in Volhynia, Dubno district. At the time, the city was part of Western Ukraine, which was occupied by Poland. Miloslav attended a Polish grammar school until the Soviet Union occupied the region in 1939. During the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, Miloslav witnessed a German pilot, who piloted a Czechoslovak aircraft, bomb train transports full of refugees and wounded soldiers. Shortly after the occupation began, the Soviets disbanded grammar schools and replaced them with ten-year schools. Ukrainian grammar schools were re-established when the Nazis invaded in 1941. Miloslav continued his education at the Simeni Petljura Grammar School until it was closed down nine months after it was reestablished. He was able to find a job in a meat factory and avoided forced labor. When the Nazis invaded, they set up a ghetto in Dubno where they sent all the Jews in the Western Ukraine. Eventually, after robbing them of their possessions, the Nazis transported the inhabitants to the site of an unfinished Soviet airfield near Dubno. After undressing them and forcing them into the pits designated for the construction of hangars, they were executed. Those who managed to escape the pits to a nearby village were eventually slaughtered along with the families housing them.  Czechoslovak Army Corps  By February 1944, the Soviets were headquartered in Volhynia (now Northwest Ukraine) and locked in a stalemate with the Germans fortified behind the River Ikva near Dubna on high ground.

This decision reversed a previous decision by the High Court that Sweeney's incarceration violated the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995 and 1997.  Background  The appellant in this case, Vincent Sweeney, was convicted of serious drug offenses in the United Kingdom on 7 December. The court sentenced him to 16 years imprisonment. Under English Law, this imprisonment consisted of serving 8 years in custody and serving the remaining half of his sentence on release on license in the community. During his sentence, the appellant sought to serve the remainder of his time in Ireland. On 16 December 2008 the appellant was transferred into Irish custody on a warrant issued by the High Court on the application of the Minister. This warrant stated that the plaintiff was the subject of a sentence of imprisonment of 16 years, with the respondent taking the Irish position that the plaintiff was entitled to be released, with remission, after 12 years in custody. In 2014, before the High Court, the appellant sought to have a declaration that the warrant issued was ultra vires the provisions of the Act of 1995 and the principles contained in the Convention, and be released from custody immediately. The High Court refused the declaration and the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court arguing the correct sentence of imprisonment was of 8 years.  Opinion of the Court  Murray J. delivered the judgment to a unanimous court. They held that under section 1(1) the 1995 Act and the Convention the word \\"sentence\\" referred to a period of actual imprisonment and does not include any period of remission: > Sentence is defined as, any period of deprivation of liberty decided by a > court or a tribunal as punishment in respect to an offense. The sentence imposed onto the appellant by the Crown court was one of a period of a \\"deprivation of liberty\\" of 8 years and a second period of liberty under license of the final 8 years. Murray J. states that the Minister's interpretation of the appellants sentence was misconceived and that the actual term of imprisonment of the appellant should be 8 years as set out by the Crown Court, not 16 years: > \\"Murray J can see no reason to why the appellant would be required to spend > his 16 sentence under the deprivation of liberty subject to the Irish terms > of imprisonment especially the period of remission given by the Minister to > prisoners for good behavior. This would mean the appellant would serve a > sentence longer than what he was sentenced to in England. Murray J decided > due to these reasons that the appellant is only required to serve 8 years > imprisonment.\\" The administrating state should be bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence imposed in the sentencing state. The sentence must be of continued enforcement by the administrating state and the court states that the warrant issued to transfer the appellant should be consistent with the sentence given by the Crown court following his conviction: > \\"Under subsection (5) to (7), a warrant shall be used to allow for a > continued enforcement in the administrating state of a sentence ordered by > the sentencing state including ant period of remission. The warrant shall > have the same force and legal nature as the original sentencing warrant.\\" = Conclusion = The Court allowed for the appellants appeal and directed the High Court to make the declaration \\"that he was not entitled to be detained on foot of the High Court order in question as and from the expiry of the first half of his sentence, namely, the 8 year period.\\"  Subsequent developments  Fintan Paul O'Farrell v Governor of Portlaoise Prison (No. 2) [2014] IEHC 420 and Ciara Fogarty v Provost and Others [2014] IEHC 417 rely on Sweeney.

Early life and education  Brown was born in San Antonio, Texas. Her father was a Black American and her mother is Mexican-American. Brown identifies as a Black Mexican American person. Growing up, Brown struggled to find representations of herself in literature, so she decided to write poetry for young women who struggle to feel represented.

Brown received her Bachelor's of Arts degree in African Diaspora Studies and Mexican American Studies from the University of Texas at Austin. She also received a Master of Fine Arts in poetry at the University of Pittsburgh and is working on a poetry manuscript about her life, the formation of a racial identity, cultural politics, and authenticity among other themes.

Brown writes poetry to uplift Black people and pay homage to her ancestors and the history of her people. She wants to inspire and uplift disempowered communities through her poetry. She also uses her poetry to validate Black girl rage. Brown has been dubbed a \\"part-time curandera\\" because her poetry deals with healing issues of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and sexual orientation.

They were used to illustrate the book The Eternal Peter Pan: Selections from Peter Pan and Wendy by James M. Barrie (1987), published by Tundra Books. In these etchings Hudson elaborated on some of the more whimsical and intriguing aspects of Barrie's writing. The etchings, tackling the theme of Peter Pan, were enhanced with hand-painted water colour patterned borders. The Eternal Peter Pan was the first volume of a trilogy which also included Peter Pan: The Complete Book (1988) and Peter Pan: The Complete Play (1988), each illustrated by Hudson. Hudson was the chairperson at the Concordia University Department of Design Art as an associate professor. In 1998 she retired from Concordia and relocated to Lunenburg. In 1999 she was elected into the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Hudson is a founding member of the ViewPoint Gallery in Halifax and a co-founder of the Peer Gallery co-operative in Lunenburg. Collections Three of Hudson's photographs were purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for the Canadian Photography Institute, one in 1975: Shadows (1973); two in 1977: The Strongman and Double Bill Nightmare (1975).

It was occupied in 1984 and legalised from 2002 onwards. It spans two sides of a city block and has entrances on both Van Broeckhuysenstraat and Tweede Walstraat. The project consists of two separate housing co-operatives living above a cafe on one side and Extrapool and a music venue on the other. Groups with shared political objectives are hosted at the centre. History of building The building was first used by two newspapers, the Provinciale Geldersche and the Nijmeegsche Courant. Afterwards it was a furniture shop before becoming derelict in the 1980s. Occupation De Grote Broek was Squatting in the Netherlandssquatted on November 4, 1984. At first it was called De Grote Karel (English: the Big Karel) after the owner's name. The name later became De Grote Broek since one side of the block is on Van Broeckhuysenstraat. One resident was Louis S√©v√®ke. Legalisation Following the death of the owner in 2002, the city of Nijmegen bought the building and a legalisation process began. Negotiations were made between the occupiers and a housing corporation, Standvast Wonen. The squatters therefore became renters and the renovations were completed in 2009. Activities *The cafe is called De Klinker and serves vegan food. It actually began in another squat in the 1970s. There is also an anarchist library called De Zwarte Uil (English: The Black Owl). *The venue is called De Onderbroek (English: The Underpants). It is located in the basement and hosts a variety of events, including punk and hardcore gigs. It is running since 1986. *Extrapool is an artist-run initiative. *Anarchist Black Cross Nijmegen. *Stichting Gast works with migrants. *Stichting Straatmensen works with homeless people. Recent events The Grote Broek celebrated 30 years of existence in November 2014. In 2018, an extreme right group was offended by the Grote Broek organising a 'Refugees Welcome' picnic. The group demonstrated for the closure of the centre, which they termed \\"a violent breeding ground for extreme leftism\\". In the same time period there were also scuffles outside the Grote Broek between rightwing supporters of Zwarte Piet celebrations and leftwingers who see it as racism. In 2019, a person was arrested near the Grote Broek and charged with making a death threat against politician Thierry Baudet because the previous day they had been at a demonstration in Amsterdam and had shouted \\"If you want to shoot Thierry dead say pow!\\" (Dutch: Als je Thierry dood wil schieten, zeg dan paf!).

That theater was severely damaged and nearly burned down in 1944 due to bombardments during the Second World War. After a laborious restoration in 1998 the theater was reopened. In recent years, the theater has hosted visiting performances from the Rete Lirica delle Marche.https://www.fondazioneliricamarche.it/ Fondazione Rete Lirica delle Marche The main hall, the Sala Poletti, recalls the Neoclassical-style of the Poletti-designed opera house, but updated in various forms. The ceiling has a concentric crown motive with a repainted copy of the original fresco of the Fasti di Apollo painted by Francesco Grandi. Grandi also designed the sipario or theater curtain that depicts the Entrance of the Emperor Caesar Augustus into the ancient Colonia Iulia Fanestris. Other less well preserved lunettes by Gioachino and Mariano Grassi are in the vaults of the first atrium. There are a few remnants of the 16th-century frescoes once found in the loggia of the Palazzo del Podest√†. A second Verdi Hall is used for concerts, conferences, and cultural events; the auditorium was designed by architect Gianni Fabbri.History of the Teatro della Fortuna, official site.

Pelham (1855‚Äì1941) was an American journalist and clubwoman. She wrote for the Detroit Plaindealer.  Early life  Meta E. Pelham was born in the free black community of Fredericksburg, Virginia in 1855, to Robert A. Pelham and Frances (Butcher) Pelham. The family, including younger brother Robert Pelham Jr., moved to Detroit, MI. Meta Pelham was one of only four black students in her class, and she graduated valedictorian. She then attended Fenton College Normal School in central Michigan.  Career  Pelham briefly taught school in the American south, but returned home to Detroit due to bad health. Around 1886, she joined the editorial staff of the Detroit Plaindealer as a writer. She wrote for other newspapers as well. By historian Gloria Wade- Gayles's count, Pelham was one of 46 black newswomen whose work was published between 1883 and 1905. Pelham was a member of the Michigan State Association of Colored Women (a chapter of the National Association of Colored Women), the Detroit Study Club, and the Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs. In 1925, Pelham encouraged African-American women to join her in the field of journalism or to help fund a black newspaper, so that positive news about the African-American Detroiters would reach the public.

Systematics Microcotyle isyebi was described and illustrated by Bouguerche et al., based on and 31 specimens (including one with molecular information), from the gills of the bogue Boops boops (Sparidae) collected at Bouharoune off the Algerian coast. The study that led to the description of M. isyebi, was derived from the atypical situation of Microcotyle erythrini. M. erythrini has been recorded from several fish host species in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, unlike many species which are considered strictly specific. This could indicate a true lack of specificity or that several cryptic species are involved. In a partial attempt to solve this issue, specimens of a monogenean resembling M. erythrini were collected from bogues, Boops boops, caught off Algeria. A comparison with previous published descriptions and also with museum specimens of M. erythrini did not yield clear morphological difference. BUT, sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) differed by 16.3% from that of M. erythrini available in GenBank and collected from the type-host Pagellus erythrinus), which indicate that the species was different. The species from B. boops was thus described as Microcotyle isyebi. Description Microcotyle isyebi has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a symmetrical elongate body and a narrow anterior end, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is triangular, subsymmetrical or symmetrical, and bears 54‚Äì102 clamps, arranged in 2 equal or sub-equal lateral rows, one on each side. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two septate oval buccal suckers at the anterior extremity, provided with a row of tiny papillae visible on ventral rims. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a small subspherical pharynx, a long thin oesophagus without lateral diverticula and a posterior intestine that bifurcates at level of genital atrium in two lateral branches apparently fused just anterior to the haptor; the left branch extends into haptor for a short distance. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium, comprising the anterior atrium proper and two posterior \\"pockets\\". The atrium proper is shaped as inverted heart, armed with numerous conical spines of similar sizes; the spines are more dense in the centre than in lateral parts, arranged as one main anterior group and two postero-lateral smaller groups called ‚Äúpockets‚Äù, a vagina with a middorsal pore visible in most specimens, posterior to genital atrium, a single complex ovary and 13‚Äì29 testes, subspherical to oval, post- ovarian, occurring in 2 rows generally intercaecal, limited to posterior half of body proper. The eggs are fusiform with two filaments at both ends, often coiled. Three sequences of the cox1 gene has been published. Etymology The species name, isyebi refers to \\"ISYEB\\", an acronym for \\"Institut de Syst√©matique, √âvolution, Biodiversit√©\\" as an acknowledgement of the help offered to the first author. Hosts and localities The bogue Boops boops is the type host of Microcotyle isyebi The type-host and only recorded host is the bogue (Boops boops, Sparidae). The identity of fish host was confirmed by barcoding. The type-locality is off Algeria.

She appeared in comedies in London and Dublin. She had relationships with her mentor Arthur Murphy, with Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol and with Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland. Life Elliot was born in Tonbridge in 1743 to Mary and Richard Elliot. Her father was the sexton of the local church. Elliot became a servant in London before she was known as a high class courtesan under the name of \\"Miss Hooper\\". She met Arthur Murphy who was a barrister and writer. Title page and scene from 1823 printing of The Citizen, produced in 1761 An example of Murphy's theatrical writings is The Citizen, a farce, first produced at Drury Lane in 1761. The play included Elliot as Maria. Ann was Murphy's protege and mistress. David Garrick was disparaging about her acting, but he did offer her a contract. However Garrick did not say that he would pay her so she went to Spranger Barry's Crow Street Theatre in Dublin. She returned to work in London spending three years in comedies at Covent Garden. In about 1765 Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol wanted her to leave the stage and become his mistress. Hervey was known as the \\"English Casanova\\". Her friendship with Murphy continued. In 1767 she took the role of Mary Ann in his new play \\"A School for Guardians\\". Murphy was given the profits from two of the six nights it was performed and he gave that money to Elliot. Death and legacy Elliot died after a long illness in a house in Greek Street in Soho that had been given to her by the Duke of Cumberland. Cumberland was the King's younger brother and she had been his mistress. She left thousands of pounds to her family including a contribution by the Duke. He arranged for her body to be buried and for a memorial to be created that includes lines attributed to Arthur Murphy. After her death an anonymous biography appeared of her life noting how Arthur Murphy was devoted to her and how he missed her after her death. After Arthur Murphy's death this relationship was written about by Fanny Burney who found Murphy's devotion to Eliot fascinating.

(born 1969), known as the 10 Killer, is a suspected German serial killer who murdered at least three prostitutes in Spain between August and September 2011. He is currently awaiting sentencing. Early life and move to Spain A native of Wiesbaden, Germany, Salhi was born to a Moroccan father and a German mother. He developed a deep disgust towards prostitutes from a young age, since his mother's extramarital activities resulted in the separation of his parents. In 1988, while trying to rob a woman, Salhi killed her, which landed him an 18 year prison sentence. After his release, Salhi illegally moved to Spain in 2007 under another identity, settling in a residence at Fontana Beach, Riviera del Sol. According to his Moroccan girlfriend, Sara Er Rezyni, he was constantly jealous when it came to his privacy and constantly avoided contradicting himself. He also held four forged passports (including Irish, French and Italian) and spoke four languages. Murders According to investigating authorities, Salhi contacted his victims through telephone after seeing their adverts in a local English- language newspaper. In order to gain their trust, he first visited them several times, having casual sex with them. After killing the women, he would steal their mobile phones, cash and credit cards, with his girlfriend later withdrawing 1,000 euros from the first two victims' bank accounts. Sara's mother was later found out to be in possession of one of the phones.  WOMAN Originally from Argentina but with Spanish nationality, the 45-year-old was killed in her rented apartment at the Complejo Alhamar in Calahonda on August 10, 2011. She had been stabbed 17 times, with a pillowcase later being tied around her neck and a pillow put on her head. Her son found her body the following morning. =Brigitte SR= The 49-year-old German prostitute was found dead by police at her Calahonda apartment on September 2, although it was estimated that she had died a week before. At the time of discovery, the corpse was at an advanced stage of decomposition, but police managed to find that Salhi's number was the last one the victim had called before her death. =Maryuri Alice P√©rez Garc√≠a= The 47-year-old Ecuadorian-born P√©rez was killed at her shared apartment in San Pedro de Alcantara on September 10. She had been stabbed 13 times and then robbed of her phone, credit card and 100 euros. It was noted that in this instance, the killer had taken the knife with him, but after the murder, had cleaned it up before leaving it at a kitchen drawer in P√©rez's house. Arrest and trial Detectives working on both cases began developing a theory that the murders were committed by the same person, backed up by the fact that the victims were supposedly chosen because they were vulnerable women who received their clients in rented flats. Through examination of phone records, they received another clue to the killer's identity, but the discovery came after 2,000 euros were withdrawn from one of the women's bank accounts. Authorities later arrested Salhi while he was working out in a local gym under the assumed name of Martin Sparitt. During the subsequent five hour investigation, he confessed to the Costa del Sol murders, providing great detail in both instances. Brigitte SR's case was later connected to the series, and he is currently being investigated for possible other murders around Spain. Despite the evidence presented, Salhi later recanted his confessions, claiming that the arresting officers had threatened and beaten him into signing the confessions. However, Rezyni admitted during questioning that on the day of one the murders, she had seen wounds on Abdelkader. Currently, his trial continues, and if convicted, Salhi could face up to 63 years imprisonment.

Her work involves experimenting with colors, themes, etc. She is not tied to a single theme, medium or style. The majority of her work revolves around engaging with the community by collaborating together with other artists and teaching classes. She experiments with various colors and uses easily definable lines in her paintings and murals. Ayala's paintings and murals display a mix of colorful images reminiscent of childhood, earthly materials such as rocks and water with a mix of ancient culture. This is the reason for the word \\"primitive\\" to describe her work.  Early life  Marta Ayala's artistic career began when she immigrated from El Salvador to San Francisco in 1968 along with her family. Ayala started producing paintings and drawings as a child. She received inspiration from her uncle Camilo Minero. He was a muralist and she followed in his footsteps. Her artwork has primitive and childlike characteristics. She is self-taught, evident from the outlines used in her images. She attended schools throughout San Francisco and in Venezuela to further her skills. Ayala received her college education in San Francisco. She attended San Francisco City college between 1977 and 1978. After a short break, in the years 1980-82, Ayala left San Francisco for Venezuela to study at the Art Institute of Sucre. From 1989 through 1993 she went to the Precita Eyes Mural Center to apprentice with Susan Cervantes (Latina muralist). She returned to San Francisco City college after her apprenticeship.  Career  She teaches various members of the Bay area community about murals, especially children. She works with young children in a \\"Spanish Through Art\\" class. Because of the murals she painted all over the city (with contributions from others) she received Best Public Art award in San Francisco. Ayala has contributed to the infamous Balmy Alley in the Mission District of San Francisco. Las Mujeres Muralistas paved the way for Ayala and other Latinas in the San Francisco mural movement.  Works  =Self portrait= This 18 √ó 24 inch painting was created with oil on canvas. Ayala painted herself grinning with satisfaction while her dream-like self is depicted in darker colors with a serious demeanor in the background. The style is primitive as there is a clear distinction between herself and the background. = Dreaming= Dreaming was created using charcoal. Ayala contributes to a theme that is common to many Latin American artists‚Äìdreams. In this piece, a woman is lying down dreaming of a naked angel-looking-man that the woman is drooling over. The third part of the image appears to be a heart inflamed. It is stated that Ayala is trying to depict the sin of lust. The woman seems content, but a mixed emotions flow because of the enflamed heart‚Äìportraying shame. =Manjushri (2001)= The Manjushri mural is in Balmy Alley. It shows an enlightened Buddhist creature painted with various colors surrounding the piece. Ayala uses elements from Tibetan Art with a mix of Latin American Art. = Waiting for 52 Excelsior (2001)= This public mural was created with paint on a wall. Nature and urbanism are displayed in this mural but without clear distinctions; everything flows together, symbolizing both worlds living together. The mural is located on Excelsior Avenue. = Garfield High Mural (2006)= This mural was painted on a wall at Garfield High School in Palo Alto, California. This work involved the students of the high school as instructed by Ayala. It has childlike characteristics as it was painted by children. The mural displays a small town on a grassy hill filled with butterflies full of color and flowers throughout. It irepresents the transformation of their city or hopes for transformation to a more positive and beautiful one. The cursive words above the mural read, \\"Latino Power Hope to Transform Our City, Our Future Community, Leadership, Our Friendships, Family.\\" = Silver Avenue Family Health Center (2006)= The Silver Avenue Family Health Center mural is a colorful piece. The mural displays people dancing in different ways in various color schemes. This was a piece of art created with the community.

It was released on December 2, 2016 through the indie hardcore label Closed Casket Activities. Shortly after the release, Full of Hell announced all proceeds from the album on Bandcamp for the remainder of 2016 would be donated to The Trevor Project and Planned Parenthood. After releasing their third studio album You Will Never Be One of Us in June 2016, Nails went on a short US headlining tour with Full of Hell. Full of Hell's vocalist Dylan Walker said the split EP came out a mutual respect for each other and that the music each band brings to the release represents where they were mentally at the time. Walker elaborated that, \\"The Nails song is an external war against anyone that holds you down and devalues you. The Full of Hell side is the inverse: an internal war against innate human violence in our genealogy and the struggle against complacent fear.\\" At the time of the EP's announcement, it was a surprise to see new music from Nails because fans and music critics believed the band had quietly gone on hiatus and it was unclear of their contribution to the EP was new or archival material. Nails cancelled some European tour dates and one of those venues' statements to ticket holders was leaked online, which suggested the band had called it quits. Nails later denied the claims of hiatus, and booked new tour dates by the end of 2016. Vince Bellino of Decibel said Nails' track \\"No Longer Under Your Control\\" speeds through with \\"nothing less than the than the unchecked rage the band have consistently delivered\\" and that Full of Hell's vocals \\"come through the storm of noise and grind like a piercing assault\\".

It became the largest wind generating facility in the state upon completion of the fourth construction phase in early 2015. The facility allowed the investor-owned utility company, Minnesota Power, to obtain more than 25% of its electricity generation from renewable sources, exceeding Minnesota's 2025 renewable portfolio standard requirement. Details The project was developed by Minnesota Power, and its parent company Allete Inc., to harvest the highly productive wind resources in the adjacent state of North Dakota. The utility provides electricity to several energy-intensive industrial customers which dominate consumption within northern Minnesota's mostly rural economy. In 2009, the company prepared for the first construction phase with the purchase and upgrade of a 465 mile high-voltage direct current transmission line that would efficiently transport the electricity from the Square Butte Substation near Center, North Dakota to the Arrowhead Substation near Duluth, Minnesota. The company's plan also called for reducing its purchases of electricity from the coal-fired generating units feeding the Square Butte Substation as the Bison wind facility grew. Construction of the first phase of 33 wind turbines began in June 2010. It included 16 Siemens SWT-2.3 MW and 17 Siemens SWT-3.0 MW turbines. The nacelle and hub components were transported by ship from Siemen's manufacturing facilities in Denmark to Allete's headquarters in Duluth, then trucked to the facility site about 40 miles west of Bismarck. The blades and the 80 meter tower sections were manufactured Fort Madison, Iowa and West Fargo, North Dakota, respectively. A new 22 mile 345 kV transmission connects the new Bison facility substation to the Square Butte Substation. Phase 1 began sending power to Minnesota by the end of 2010, and was fully commissioned in February 2012, with a total capital cost of about $177 million. Construction phases 2 and 3 each consist of 35 Siemens SWT-3.0 MW turbines. Two phase 1 turbines were transferred to an initial phase 1B grouping which was ultimately included in phase 3. Phases 2 and 3 both came online at the end of 2012. The latest and largest construction phase 4 began in the fall of 2013 and consists of 64 Siemens SWT-3.2 MW turbines. These more powerful turbines enable direct drive of the generator unit, thus reducing the number mechanical components and increasing reliability. The 92 meter tower sections were manufactured in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, a portion of the generator units in Hutchinson, Kansas, and the blades in Fort Madison, Iowa. A new 11 mile 345 kV transmission line and substation were constructed to connect the west side of the facility to an expansion of original Bison substation. The cost of this expansion phase was about $345 million, bringing the total investment in the facility to nearly $800 million. Phase 4 came online at the beginning of 2015. In September 2015 Siemens announced that it had been contracted to provide operational and maintenance (O&M;) support for the 3.0 MW and 3.2 MW turbines (total of 149 units) at the Bison Wind Energy Center for their first 10 years of operation. Minnesota Power is continuing to provide O&M; support for the remaining 2.3 MW turbines (total of 16 units).

She has worked in engraving, painting, sculpture, and most prominently in tapestries, defining herself by her profound artistic use and arrangement of native Mexican natural materials. She was one of the first Mexican artists to focus on themes around women's and immigrants' experiences during the 1970s, especially in her Ilerda series of tapestries and later with her Nahual sculptures. Early life Marta Palau Bosch was born on July 17, 1934 in Albesa, Spain. As her parents were exiled during the era of Francoist Spain, the family moved to Mexico in 1940. From 1955 to 1965 she studied at \\"La Esmeralda\\", the school of painting and sculpture for the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) in Mexico City. Her engraving professor at the Institute was the Colombian engraver Guillermo Silva Santamar√≠a. She traveled to California and Barcelona in order to specialize in tapestry technique, and in San Diego State University she was a student of Paul Lingren while in Barcelona she was a disciple of . Career In 1968 Palau was a founding member of the , an artistic project collectively organized as a response against the Institute's convocation of the \\"Exposici√≥n Solar\\" (Solar Exhibition), highlighting current artistic themes in Mexico as a parallel cultural event for the 1968 Summer Olympics. The Salon's response reflected the societal context of the repression of student activist movements in Mexico during that year as part of the . Some of the artists involved were Helen Escobedo, Lilia Carrillo, Gilberto Aceves Navarro, , Manuel Felgu√©rez, , , Brian Nissen and , among others. The Salon continued its political dissidence with exhibitions in 1969 and 1970, after which it dissolved. From 1973 to 1976, Palau Bosch served as coordinator of the Centre d'Art Modern de Guadalajara, Jalisco. At the beginning of the 1980s she created an experimental workshop in Havana. In 1981, Palau Bosch presented an homage to the former Mexican president L√°zaro C√°rdenas del R√≠o, in Jiquilpan, in thanks for his work accepting refugees from the Spanish Republican Party into Mexico after the Spanish Civil War. The silk-screen prints that she exhibited there are some of the works that most closely reflect her personal history. In her own words she related this aspect of her life: > \\"I was not conscious of what L√°zaro C√°rdenas had done, for my parents and > for many other Spanish Republicans, until years after my arrival in Mexico. > I was not conscious of what it meant to live in exile far away from a > country where justice had been trampled and torn apart by fascism. I was too > small when I arrived to Mexico to realize the pain that all of this > represented. I learned later that L√°zaro C√°rdenas was the man who had given > a second country and a new nationality to the Spanish refugees. He gave to > me the only country I have had, and the other one, the Spanish one, I had > lost before even knowing it.\\" (translation) Selection of screen prints from her Homage to L√°zaro C√°rdenas del R√≠o: File:Serie C√°rdenas por M Palau 7.jpg File:Serie C√°rdenas por M Palau 9.jpg File:Serie C√°rdenas por M Palau 2.jpg File:Serie C√°rdenas por M Palau 4.jpg File:Serie C√°rdenas por M Palau 1.jpg File:Serie C√°rdenas por M Palau 5.jpg Exhibitions The artist has exhibited in various parts of the Mexican Republic, including the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. There she has exhibited in three shows: The first one in 1974, Del tapiz a la escultura; later in 1985, Mis caminos son terrestres and finally in 2012, Tr√°nsitos de naualli. She has also had an important artistic presence in the United States, Spain, and in various Latin American countries. Since 1982, she has organized the Sal√≥n Michoacano del Textil en Miniatura (Michoacan Miniature Textile Salon) with the help of governor Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas Sol√≥rzano. In 1996, Palau Bosch organized the first Sal√≥n Internacional de Estandartes (International Banner Biennial), which in her words \\"serves to introduce artists from Baja California to international circles, as representatives of the vigorous cultural movement that has surged on our border during the last ten years.\\" The Salon had its first three editions (1996, 1997, 1998), later converting to a biannual exhibition. The artist was responsible for recovering the use of the banner as a technique to reflect the specific problems inherent in the border. The 2010 Biennial convened 37 artists from Latin America and the United States, with special emphasis on border zones. Also, the format of the banner combined with the particular museography and display required by the Centro Cultural Tijuana imposed new possibilities and technical challenges on the artists. Emilio Carballido comments: \\"The inventor of everything, Marta Palau, at the , has had to do something new. That's what the art of the world owes them now. And of course the art of Mexico.\\" In 1998, Palau Bosch conceived and directed an ambitious international show at the Museum of the City of Mexico titled Cinco continentes y una ciudad (5 continents and a city), for which she invited a curator from each continent. This exhibit returned in 2015 for a second edition. The artist is a member of the consulting group for the Museo de Mujeres Artistas Mexicanas (MUMA) since its formation in 2008, together with artists and art students such as Ana Quiroz, Karen Cordero, Grace Quintanilla and M√≥nica Mayer. The mission of this museum is to record the history of Mexican women in the visual arts during the 20th Century. In 2010, Palau Bosch won the Mexican Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in Fine Arts. She resides in Tijuana part of the time, and the other part in Mexico City.

In order to create her works, she utilizes a mix of elements of land art, abstract expressionism, and pop art. Some of her works reflect her interest for the cave paintings of Baja California. In her tapestries, she uses natural Mexican fibers, and in some of her paintings she uses native Amate paper from Mexico. In incorporating materials such as wire, cord, and fiber into her weaving, Palau and others such as Olga de Amaral, Myra Landau, and Feliciano B√©jar, have created \\"a highly original form of aesthetic expression\\" specific to Latin America. The exploration of tapestries serves an important role in her work. After having developed her techniques in engraving, during the 1970s she began to work with weavings, initially beginning with the serape. According to Raquel Tibol, in those years many artists were interested in weaving, which incited Palau Bosch to travel to Barcelona where she met Grau Garriga and assimilated his style. Her reevaluation of tapestry as a medium led to a reconsideration of the division between the artist and the artisan: when the former returns to a technique relegated to the \\"lower arts\\", they recover their status as a manual worker. For Tibol, the value of the artist's works woven with henequen, wool or synthetic yarns align them more with the world of sculpture. Many critics have agreed that in Palau Bosch's tapestries there is an exaltation of sensuality as an artistic value. Her works reflect the influence of Catalan Informalism, a movement that reached its apex at the end of the 1950s and believes in the footprint of the temperament and the wisdom of instinct on artistic language. However, she uses her works to develop ideas around specific themes, such as the critique of censorship and repression of the Franco dictatorship in Los Sellos de la Espa√±a Sellada (The Stamps of Stamped Spain) in 1976. In 1970, the artist participated for the second time in the Salon Independiente, exhibiting Ambientaci√≥n Alqu√≠mica (Alchemical Atmosphere), one of her most well known pieces that currently forms part of the standing collection of the Museo Universitario Arte Contempor√°neo. It is an open, walk-in structure with movable wooden wall panels and geometric forms made from carton and newsprint, with numbers and syllables painted on it that form the word \\"Tetragramaton\\". While inside it, the spectator becomes an active and ludic element in the work itself, a concept that had barely begun to be explored in that time. According to the artist, the installation is: > \\"un talism√°n de protecci√≥n y fuerza, en el cual el p√∫blico participa porque > parte de su chiste es que hay que entrar y, al hacerlo, las puertas giran y > siempre aparece la misma imagen: un tri√°ngulo basado en la alquimia, en el > nombre de Dios que no se puede pronunciar, que es Yav√©, que est√° dividida en > cuatro letras, que son cuatro s√≠labas\\" \\"a talisman of strength and > protection, in which the public participates, because part of the joke is > that you have to enter, and upon doing so, the doors revolve and the same > image appears over and over: a triangle based in alchemy, in the name of God > that should not be spoken, Yahweh, that is divided into 4 letters, that is 4 > syllables\\" (translation) Her later works consist of installations and tapestries made with natural materials such as coco fibers and dyed corn husks. The ensemble of pieces titled Mis caminos son Terrestres (My roads are lands) has been interpreted by as approaching an identity somewhere between the structure of myth and art. Of her large-scale installations, some of which have used Amate bark, salt, and earth, Palau Bosch has stated that her use of natural fibers has led to her desire to learn more about native peoples' rituals and practices. She says that \\"Art begins as ritual magic\\" and believes that even modern, urbanized peoples continue the traditions of magic in their world. In her installation Nomadas II, Palau plays with the dimensions of a series of sizes of disembodied outstretched feet, referencing cave paintings made by early humans found in the rockshelters of Baja California. In Doble Muro, the artist comments on the issue of undocumented immigrants and the proposed border wall between the United States and Mexico, by creating a structure of two walls on a base of wooden columns. Inside, on the floor of the structure is the outline of a human body woven with fibers, surrounded by the 2 symbolical walls, evoking the chalk silhouettes made by police or medical personnel to demarcate the position of a cadaver on the ground.  Themes on the subject of women  Her works around the Naualli (Nagual), the feminine figure of the shaman, are characterized by vaginal indents and forms of the vulva that serve as symbols of magic and the curative powers of the female warrior, the witch, or the priestess. The materials she uses in this group of works, vegetable fibers, leaves and dry branches, have been interpreted as a link to the natural and sacred world. For Gonz√°lez Mello, in Recinto de Shamanes (Shaman's enclosure) (which in the words of the artist \\"is like a great vagina representing fertility\\"), the work problematizes the relationship between \\"the outside and the inside\\", dislocating and incommoding the spectator, as in her Ambientaci√≥n Alqu√≠mica - that for certain contains symbols referring to the masculine and the feminine. In the latter work, a structure with a particular \\"inside\\" bursts into the architectonic space of the museum and plants a familiar nature, interior and distinct, from the menacing nature that opposes masculine reason. Palau's work Front-era is a 10 foot-high organic structure consisting of the geometric shapes formed by small ladders woven from twigs. According to curator Rachel Teagle, this work reflects the triangle as a symbol of feminine mysticism, along with a metaphor for immigration, citing that simple ladders were used by immigrants crossing the border between Mexico and the United States during the 1980s.  Other works  Palau has been a stage designer for theatre and dance on numerous occasions. She has worked in conjunction with the dramatist Emilio Carballido, who has written about her work. In 2002, she illustrated Carballido's book Venus-Quetzalc√≥atl y cinco cuentos. In 2007 and 2014, the artist has participated in exhibitions in honor of Carballido and his artistic works. In 1995, the artist published a children's book titled Cueva Pintada (Painted cave), published by the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, in conjunction with the Centro Cultural Tijuana and Tel√©fonos del Noroeste. In the book, she narrates a legend about the pictographic cave paintings in Baja California which are the subject of the accompanying illustrations.  Exhibitions  Selected exhibitions: * 2014.

Biography  Goldblatt was born March 14, 1891 in Iowa to Phillip and Jennie Spitz Goldblatt. Goldblatt graduated from McGill University with a B.A. in 1912 and an M.D. degree in 1916. He then served at Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal and as a member of the Medical Reserve Corps of the United States Army, before doing a residency at Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. He studied pathology and surgery at the Lister Institute of Preventative Medicine and University College London. From 1924 to 1946, he was a professor of pathology at Western Reserve University. He then was the director of the Institute for Medical Research Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, before returning to Cleveland in 1953 to work at Mount Sinai Hospital. Goldblatt married Jeanne Rea on June 25, 1929, and had two sons, both doctors. He retired in 1976 and died of pulmonary edema in 1977.  Research  As a pathologist, Goldblatt had observed narrowing of renal blood vessels in autopsies of people with hypertension. He hypothesized that decreased blood flow to the kidneys could have a role in increasing blood pressure. To test this, he partially clamped shut the renal arteries in dogs to decrease the blood flow, and observed a rise in blood pressure in response. He published these findings in 1934. In later years, it was discovered that the lack of blood flow to the kidneys causes a release of renin, triggering vasoconstriction and a corresponding increase in blood pressure. Because of his contributions, the World Health Organization has designated \\"Goldblatt units\\" as the standard unit of measure of renin.  Honors  In 1973, Goldblatt was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences. And in 1976, he received the Scientific Achievement Award of the American Medical Association. The American Heart Association has established the Harry Goldblatt Award in Cardiovascular Research.

Known as the \\"Apostle of the Istro-Romanians\\", he is recognized for his struggle for the Istro-Romanian culture and language, being notable his book Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie, the first in history written in this language in collaboration with Constantin Diculescu. He also managed to the creation of an Istro-Romanian municipality in 1922 being he the first mayor, giving classes in Istro-Romanian in the only school of the municipality. Glavina was born in 1881 in the village of ≈†u≈°njevica. At age 12, he was taken to Romania by the Romanian ethnographer and folklorist Teodor Burada to be educated at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Ia»ôi. Then he would return to Istria to teach in two other villages until the opening of the first school in ≈†u≈°njevica by Italy just after the end of the World War I. Biography Andrei Glavina was born on 30 November 1881 in the village of Frascati- Susgnevizza (now ≈†u≈°njevica), at the moment part of the municipality of Bogliuno (now Boljun). Teodor Burada, a Romanian ethnographer and folklorist that visited the region of ƒÜiƒáarija to study the Istro-Romanian language, meet the 12-year-old Glavina in 1893. He was convinced that he could save the fates of the Istro-Romanians, so, with the permission of his parents, Teodor took Glavina to Romania to study in the University of Ia»ôi. He passed his studies even after not going to school for a while. At the beginning of the 20th century, Glavina returned to Istria as a qualified teacher of the Romanian and Italian languages to teach at secondary schools, first in Parenzo (now Poreƒç) and then in Santa Domenica d'Albona (now Sveta Nedelja), where he remained until 1918. In 1905, he published the first book written entirely in the Istro-Romanian language alongside the Romanian historian Constantin Diculescu, Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie, in which Istro-Romanian popular words, proverbs and stories are compiled. Later, in 1920, he published the historical-political text I romeni dell'Istria and L'educazione nazionale, a magazine about the bilingual education of the Italian-Romanian schools. His last works were collected in Promemoria e lettere by his spouse, Fiorella Zagabria. Glavina died on 9 February 1925 due to tuberculosis in a hospital in Pula. Adult life =Scholar life= Glavina wanted to awaken the identity of the other Istro-Romanians and transmit his language and culture to them. Therefore, he struggled unsuccessfully for the severely deficient education of the Istro-Romanians, despite having the support of some Istro-Romanians and having addressed the Romanian professor Alexiu Viciu with the intention that Romania pressured the Austria-Hungarian Empire to establish a Romanian school for the Istro-Romanians. Later, Glavina would go to the only Istro-Romanian village outside of ƒÜiƒáarija, ≈Ωejane, to find out if they also wanted a Romanian school and to get Romania to support the project. However, Austria- Hungary, partly due to the Croatian pressure, remained firm in its decision, so Glavina had to limit himself to advertising campaigns in local and national newspapers and failed contacts with deputies of the empire. However, after World War I, when Istria was annexed by the Kingdom of Italy, Glavina made the same petiton again. The school of Frascati-Susgnevizza was immediately opened with Glavina as its leader. To celebrate it, Glavina wrote a patriotic anthem for the Istro-Romanians, Imnul istro-romanilor. The popularity among the children of the school began to grow to the point that between 1919 and 1920, there were 180 students, later extending to a total of 443. Although the classes were given in Istro-Romanian, the textbooks were in Italian and later in Romanian. Nevertheless, after his death, the Romanian school was replaced by an Italian one. Due to his efforts to preserve the culture of his people, Glavina is commonly called as the \\"Apostle of the Istro-Romanians\\". =Political life= At the same time, Glavina aimed to unify the Istro- Romanian villages in one single municipality south of the Uƒçka mountain range, as the economic and social conditions there were bad. Although Austra-Hungary always opposed the project, Italy took it into consideration. Finally, it was approved by the Provincial Council and the municipality of Valdarsa was created on 19 January 1922, of which Glavina was its first mayor. After being named mayor, Glavina worked on the economic conditions of the municipality and planned the construction of a larger school, a road to connect with the Adriatic coast, a post office and a telegraph, among others. However, his greatest ambitions were to recover the Ra≈°a River basin (although this was previously proposed by Venice and Austria), which was completed in 1932, and the exploitation of a nearby semi-abandoned coal mine. By the time these projects were completed, Glavina had already passed away. He was succeeded as mayor by a local, Francesco Bellulovich.

TAG Industries went out of business in the 1980s, and its assets, including the Crimson Dragon Miniatures line, were purchased by Ravens Forge Miniatures in 1996. Reception In the January 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue 81), Kim Eastland reviewed the first offerings in the Crimson Dragon Miniatures line, and commented, \\"this initial line is... impressive.\\" He liked the sculpts, noting the \\"good detail and some nice touches (like the fighter mage's armor and magical sword.).\\" Eastman was also impressed by size of some of the figurines, saying, \\"What is most noticeable about the line is the company's fearlessness in casting big figures. The Messenger of the Gods is nearly 40 mm tall, and looks like he could be from some fantasy pantheon as he towers over most other figures.\\" In the May 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue 85), Eastland reviewed two of the company's fantasy dinosaur miniatures and commented, \\"For those miniaturists who love the unusual, TAG has created some fascinating creatures... A particularly nice touch is the crawling, lizardlike appearance of the Dragon, reminiscent of the old Lost World-type movies.\\" In the March- April 1985 edition of Space Gamer (No. 73), Edwin J.

As a two-year-old she was initially trained in Ireland where she failed to win in four races although she did finish third in the Marble Hill Stakes. Later in the year she was moved to England and improved, winning a minor race and being placed in both the Rockingham Stakes and the Rockfel Stakes. In the following year she developed into one of the best fillies of her generation in Europe, winning the Nell Gwyn Stakes and the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches as well as finishing third in both the 1000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes. After her retirement from racing she became a broodmare and had modest success as a dam of winners. Background Valentine Waltz was a bay mare bred in Ireland by the County Limerick-based Kilfrush Stud. As a yearling she was consigned to the Tattersalls Houghton Yearling Sales on 1 October and was bought for 75,000 guineas by Kern/Lillingston Associates. The filly entered the ownership of the Kirby Maher Syndicate and was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. She was from the twentieth crop of foals sired by Be My Guest, an American- bred stallion who won the Waterford Crystal Mile when trained in Ireland by Vincent O'Brien. Be My Guest's other offspring included Assert, Pentire Go and Go, Luth Enchantee and On The House. Her dam, Save Me The Waltz, won one race in France and became a successful broodmare who also produced the Matron Stakes winner Sense of Style. She was a half-sister to Last Tycoon and closely related to Assert, Bikala and Eurobird. Racing career =1998: two-year- old season= On her racecourse debut Valentine Waltz started the 6/4 for a maiden race over five furlongs at Cork Racecourse on 26 April but finished only fourth of the eleven runners behind Show Me The Money. Seventeen days later she went off favourite for a similar event at Navan Racecourse but was beaten again, coming home third behind the colts My Chief and Rainbows Forever. Despite her two defeats she was stepped up in class for the Listed Marble Hill Stakes at the Curragh on 23 May. Starting a 25/1 outsider she stayed on well in the closing stages to take third place behind Access All Areas and Coralita, beaten half a length by the winner. The filly was dropped back to maiden class at the Curragh on 27 June but disappointed as she was beaten more than nine lengths into fourth place in a race won by Fear and Greed. Shortly after her second defeat at the Curragh Valentine Waltz was transferred to England and joined the stable of John Gosden. On her first run for her new trainer the filly started 5/2 second choice for a seven furlong maiden at Brighton Racecourse on 30 September. Ridden by Daragh O'Donohoe she recorded her first victory as she led from the start and won \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths. Ten days later at Doncaster Racecourse she finished strongly to take third place behind the colts Undeterred and Indiana Legend in the Listed Rockingham Stakes. On 17 October she was stepped up to Group 2 class for the Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and produced her best performance of the season. Starting a 20/1 outsider she overcame interference in the final furlong to finish second of the fourteen runners, beaten one and a quarter lengths by Hula Angel. =1999: three-year-old season= On 13 April Valentine Waltz was ridden by Frankie Dettori when she began her second campaign in the Group 3 Nell Gwyn Stakes (a trial race for the 1,000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket and started the 7/2 favourites against ten opponents. After racing just behind the leaders she went to the front approaching the final furlong and accelerated away from her rivals to win by three lengths. In the 1999 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 2 May the filly was partnered by Ray Cochrane and went off at odds of 11/1 in a field of 22. Racing up the far side of the track, she briefly took the lead a furlong out but was headed in the closing stages and finished third, beaten half a length and a short head by Wince and Wannabe Grand who raced up the opposite side of the course. Two weeks after her run in the Guineas Valentine Waltz was sent to contest the French equivalent, the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. With Cochrane again in the saddle she started the 4.3/1 third favourite behind Moiava (Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte) and Rangoon Ruby, while the best-fancied of the other eleven runners included Calando (May Hill Stakes), Comillas (Prix des R√©servoirs) and Venize (Prix de la Grotte). After turning tinto the straight in seventh place, Valentine Waltz produced a strong late run, took the lead inside the last 200 metres, and won by two lengths from the 42/1 outsider Karmifira. John Gosden commented \\"They went a cracking pace and I liked the way she won. She ran a grand race in the Guineas from a terrible draw... She is a tough little thing to come back and run like this after her hard race in the Guineas\\". At Royal Ascot on 16 June Valentine Waltz was partnered by Pat Eddery when she started second favourite for the Coronation Stakes. After being restrained in the early stages ahe finished well without being able to reach the lead and dead-heated for third with Wannabe Grand behind Balisada and Golden Silca. Valentine Waltz did not race again and was retired at the end of the year. Breeding record After her retirement from racing, Valentine Waltz became a broodmare for the American breeder George Strawbridge. She produced at least seven foals and two winners between 2002 and 2014: *Bahja, a chestnut filly, foaled in 2002, sired by Seeking The Gold. Failed to win in two races. *Vienna Prince, bay colt (later gelded), 2003, by Kingmambo. Failed to win in six races. *Metternich, brown colt, 2005, by Seeking The Gold. Failed to win in two races. *Dyna Waltz, bay filly, 2007, by Dynaformer. Won two races including the Lingfield Oaks Trial. *Utterance, bay colt (gelded), 2009, by Dansili. Won one race. *Perfect Lyric, bay filly, 2011, by Pivotal. Failed to win a race. *Dream Waltz, bay filly, 2014, by Oasis Dream. Failed to win in two races. Pedigree * Valentine Waltz was inbred 2 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the second and fourth generations of her pedigree.

According to Ho, she was embarrassed as a child by the \\"brothy, weirdly fishy\\" dishes that her family ate, at least in part because of how other children might react. Ho graduated from Grinnell College in 2009. As a chef, Ho has worked at restaurants in New Orleans , Minneapolis, Portland, Oregon, and Puerto Vallarta, where her mother owned a restaurant. In 2019, she replaced Michael Bauer, who retired after 32 years as the restaurant critic for the San Francisco Chronicle. Ho has joked that Bauer, her predecessor at the newspaper, held the job since she was \\"not even a fetus\\".  Literary works  Ho is careful about the connotations of the words she selects. A specific example is that she does not use the term \\"kaffir lime\\" because kaffir is a racial slur in South Africa. More generally, she does not think that \\"ethnic\\" food is a legitimate concept. Ho says \\"The imprecision of the word‚Äîand the assumption that it doesn‚Äôt apply equally to people and cuisines associated with Europe or white America‚Äîgives me such a headache.\\" She considers terms like \\"sustainable,\\" \\"responsibly grown\\" and \\"farm-to-table\\" to be marketing buzzwords that are too often abused.

The game allows the player to take control of the novel's young hero, the teenage beggar Kim, as he begins his practical training as a field agent working for British intelligence in \\"The Great Game\\". Along the way, Kim meets an aged Tibetan lama and adopts him as his traveling companion, joining his search for a spiritual river of healing. Carry secret messages for Mahbub Ali the charismatic horse trader and undercover British agent, dicker for food with street vendors, collect maps to speed your travel, and experience the wonder of the \\"te-rain\\" that connects British India from Lahore to Benares.  Gameplay  The game's open-world format encourages players to explore at their own pace, either following the plot of Kipling's novel through a series of quests or charting their own path among the lively cities, roads, and countryside of India. Players gain and lose merit for their choices on the road, and can also increase their score by winning the good opinion of the game's major NPCs. The game ends once Kim reaches manhood at the age of 18. There is an element of stealth involved in some parts of the game, as attempting to break into a building or attacking an NPC will attract the attention of the police. Avoiding the sight lines of NPCs (pictured as cone- shaped patches of light) will ensure that the player's activities remain unnoticed. Being caught will result in a time penalty, advancing the player closer to the end-point of Kim's eighteenth birthday. The player can acquire different suits of clothing, which unlock new options for interaction with NPCs and locations, and equip various period-relevant weapons such as the \\"Brown Bess\\" flintlock musket. Food and drink increase Kim's health and happiness, which decline over time more or less quickly depending on the player's choices; for example, travelling quickly on foot will sap health while costing a shorter amount of time, and purchasing sweets or other treats from a street vendor will increase Kim's happiness.  Dialogue and environments  The game features passages quoted directly from Kipling's novel to populate the text-based NPC dialogue interactions and provide descriptions when the player enters newly-discovered locations. These location introductions also include period photographs of cities and major landmarks, while the game environments are 2.5D hand-painted town maps and procedurally generated countryside. The wide variety of NPCs which populate the world capture the cultural, social, and religious diversity in British colonial India, ranging from English policemen to Hindu merchants, Sikh letter writers, Muslim priests, and many more.  Reception  Glitch Free Gaming praised Kim as \\"deep and intelligent,\\" being characterized by \\"beautiful language,\\" a \\"unique setting,\\" and a \\"subtle and atmospheric\\" soundtrack, while noting the \\"time and investment\\" required to get into the game. The Idle Weekend podcast criticized the game's \\"intrusive\\" combat mechanics, contrasting them to the \\"personable\\" and \\"charming\\" quality of Kim's coming-of-age story, something that TechRaptor also alluded to, complaining that \\"the game has a lot of moving parts but most of them never seem to interact with each other.\\" Several other reviewers focused on the game's character as an adaptation of a classic literary work. Rock Paper Shotgun referenced Kipling's reputation as an orientalist writer, but saw the game as \\"channel[ing] much of the appeal of the novel,\\" which is \\"charming and warm, open-minded even as it betrays a mind shaped by casual, offhanded racism.\\" Gamasutra compared Kim to The Witcher 3 (which was released the year before [2015]) in that both games are adaptations of classic novels, and interviewed Jeremy Hogan (founder of The Secret Games Company) on the unusual decision to make a game based on a British novel more than a century old.

It lies on the eastern slopes of the Menashe Heights and the western edge of the Jezreel Valley. As of the beginning of the excavations in 1975, almost half of the site was still visible, but today the entire site is covered by the houses of HaZore'a. The site spans an area of one hectare and is believed to have been a dependency of the nearby Tel Yokneam. The site hosted some human activity during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, as well as parts of the Bronze Age. An uninterrupted sequence of settlement lasted from the Iron Age to the Roman- Byzantine period. Unlike all urban centers in northern Israel, the village in Tel Qiri, which flourished during the Iron Age, escaped all military events and no traces of destruction can be found there. This minor, damaged and seemingly insignificant site yielded an amazingly rich and diverse quantity of remains of different periods.A. Ben-Tor, M. Avisar, Ruhama Bonf√≠l, I. Zerzetsky and Y. Portugali, A Regional Study of Tel Yoqne øam and Its Vicinity, Qadmoniot 77‚Äì79, 1987 p. 3 (Hebrew)Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, p.1‚Äì4 The excavation of Tel Qiri is part of the Yoqneam Regional Project, which conducted excavations at nearby Tel Yokneam and Tel Qashish.Ben-Tor, 1979, p.105 Geography Tel Qiri is located on the slopes of Menashe Heights, on the connecting point between the heights and the Jezreel Valley. It does not have the typical shape of a mound, but is more like a terrace, sloping steeply towards the nearby Shofet River. It is situated on the route between the two major ancient cities of Yokneam and Megiddo, which are located on major junctions of the international Via Maris route. The climate is moderate, water is abundant, and the soil is fertile, making it an excellent place for an agricultural settlement. The site is located within the boundaries of Kibbutz HaZore'a. The activity of the kibbutz, as well as the digging of defensive positions during the 1948 war, have severely damaged the site.Ben-Tor, 1979, pp.106‚Äì107 Archaeology The excavations in Tel Qiri took place between 1975 and 1977. A total of three seasons of six weeks each were conducted. The excavation was a rescue excavation, as the site was destined to be destroyed by the further expansion of the nearby settlement. The excavation was partially funded by the Israel Antiquities Authority and was a joint project of the authority along with the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and the Israel Exploration Society. It was headed by Amnon Ben-Tor and Yuval Portugali.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, p.XIX Archaeologists have unearthed eleven strata of settlement. The deepest, eleventh layer contains remains of an agricultural settlement from the Neolithic period (c. 10,000 ‚Äì 4500 BCE) and potsherds from the Ghassulian culture (c. 4400 ‚Äì 3500 BCE) and first half of the Early Bronze Age (c. 3000 ‚Äì 2200 BCE). The village was re-established during the Middle Bronze Age, c. 1750 ‚Äì 1650 BCE, and ceased to exist in the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550 ‚Äì 1200 BCE). An era of uninterrupted settlement begins at the start of the Iron Age (c. 1200 ‚Äì 539 BCE) and continues through the Achaemenid (539‚Äì330 BCE), Hellenistic (330‚Äì63 BCE), and up until the Roman Empire and Byzantine periods (63 BCE ‚Äì 634 CE). = Bronze Age = The Middle Bronze Age remains include some walls and pottery. It most likely existed during the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age, from 2000 to 1550 BCE. It seems the settlement was limited to the eastern part of the site and did not have any fortification system.Ben- Tor and Portugali, 1987, p. 272 Only fragmentary remains from the Late Bronze Age were found and these do not include any remains of buildings or walls. One explanation may be that upon constructing the succeeding Iron Age settlement, the Late Bronze Age settlement was completely leveled and its stones were looted, but this is a bit far-fetched. It seems that the Late Bronze Age settlement, had there been one, was much more limited than the preceding Iron Age settlement. Out of the handful of remains are two Mycenaean and Cypriot ceramics, as well as other luxury and high-quality ceramics. This phenomenon has no clear explanation, but it may be that these all were imported to the site. This group of ceramics is specifically dated to the beginning of the Late Bronze Age (1550‚Äì1300 BCE), but can also represent the entire period (up until 1200 BCE).Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, pp. 257‚Äì8 = Iron Age period = Tel Qiri was settled throughout the entire Iron Age period. The excavation has revealed five settlement strata, further divided into twelve phases.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, p.53 Most of the remains from the later days of the Iron Age were partially or completely lost due to modern residential construction. Several oil mills from this period were found. The farmers grew bitter vetch, wheat, pistachios, olives, and pomegranate. Most of the bones found were of sheep and goats; a minority of the bones belong to cows and other wild animals such as gazelle, deer, wild pig, and bear.Ben-Tor, Portugali, 1987, p.137 The earliest Iron Age layer is dated to the beginning of the Iron Age I period, around the 12th century BCE. Remains of a large building, with a system of rooms and an oven, are noteworthy. A Canaanite jar was discovered, which seems to have been carried over from the previous Late Bronze Age. The absence of Philistine pottery is also noteworthy and implies this layer represent a time before the Philistines settled the region.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, pp. 99‚Äì101 A system of houses and agricultural installations was found dated to the Iron Age I period, between the 12th to 10th centuries BCE. Some of the pottery belongs to Philistine types. One of the houses, dated to the 11th century BCE yielded several tools used in religious rituals. An Egyptian amulet made of faience in the form of the Egyptian deity of Ptah-Sokar, typical of this period, was found, as well as an incense burner. An interesting discovery from a later stage of the building was an abundance of animal bones. Most of the bones belonged to sheep and goats, and most of them were the right forelegs of the animals. Such a collection of bones is unique to this building and indicates animal sacrifices, similar to a type of sacrifice described in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 29:22 and Leviticus 7:32). This type of Israelite sacrifice was common in the Near East during this period and originated in this region. An example of this sacrifice method is found in a Late Bronze Age temple at Tel Lachish. Although this temple looks like a regular house, it is common to find religious activity in regular houses during this period and mentions of rituals done inside regular houses can be found in the Hebrew Bible in Judges 17:5. Another prevalent finding in Tel Qiri's Iron Age layers is the large quantity of chalices, which constitute a much higher percentage of Tel Qiri's ceramics than in other sites. It is possible that Tel Qiri had more temples and was a religious center in the region, or that it was connected to the extensive religious activity of the nearby Mount Carmel.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, pp 86‚Äì98 At the beginning of the Iron Age II period, around the 9th century BCE, the supposed time of the United Kingdom of Israel and later the Samarian Kingdom of Israel, an entire residential section of the village was replaced by an oil production industry. Some of the structures were leveled off for these new installations. Pottery found from that period included very large cooking pots, some marked with unknown, letter-like marks.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, pp. 67‚Äì74 A large public building, wide and long, with massive walls between wide, was found from this era. The building first had a large courtyard room and two small rooms. In a later period, new walls were built inside to create two small and two large rooms. Some of the ceramics have been proven to be imported thanks to a study of their clay composition. The ceramics are dated to the 8th- century BCE.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, p.105 In 720 BCE the northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire along with Tel Qiri and the rest of the north. By looking at the architectural remains it seems the settlement underwent some changes in its plan. An Assyrian-style bottle was discovered close to the surface, next to a modern road. In 586 BCE the Assyrian rulers were replaced by the Neo-Babylonian Empire and a pilgrim-flask of this period was found. A flower pot was discovered, and parallels of this vessel were later found at the nearby Tel Yokneam and Tell Keisan. These vessels are foreign to the Jezreel Valley and seem to have been imported from the coastal region and are probably of Phoenician origin; and Tel Keisan is a possible option.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, p. 62‚Äì66  Philistine presence  Typical Philistine pottery The Philistines were an ancient nation mentioned numerous times in the Hebrew Bible for their wars and conflicts against the Israelites. Philistine-type pottery was found in almost every site in the Jezreel Valley dating from the early 12th century through the late 11th century, corresponding to the time of the Biblical judges who, according to the Bible, ruled over the Israelites during the time of their settlement in Canaan. Vessels with Philistine decorations and pottery with collared-rims were often found nearby, leading archeologists to relate them to the Philistines as well. In the Iron Age I settlement, dated to the said period, some Philistine pottery was found. Items included a decorated jug and collared-rim sherds. Scholars have attributed the appearance of Philistine pottery in northern Israel to their role as Egyptian mercenaries during the time Egypt ruled over the Levant, and either an indication of their expansion north or their trade with Israelite and Canaanite cities. Several mentions of the presence of Philistines in the north are found in the Book of Judges.Avner Raban, =Persian cemetery= The actual settlement during the Persian period was not discovered, but pottery scattered all over the site indicates that the site was inhabited throughout the entire Persian period (539‚Äì330 BCE). The excavation did find a Persian cemetery with some 18 tombs dated between 450 and 300 BCE. One distinct feature of these burials is that they lack any grave goods. This may indicate a certain burial custom of the ethnic group that lived there, or otherwise their poverty.Ben-Tor, Portugali, 1987, pp.15-26 The number of people buried in each grave varies from one to three. In the latter case there are usually a male, a female, and a child, and around a third of them are younger than 17, while only one skeleton belonged to a person older than 50. An extensive study of the skeletons was made by Baruch Arensburg of the Tel Aviv University. The female individuals buried in the graveyard appear to have been considerably shorter than the men, with an average height of and , respectively. The difference in the height between the sexes () is greater than the modern average difference (). This was hypothesized to be because of social conditions discriminating against women, possibly in terms of food consumption. The features of the skulls resemble people from Iron Age sites in Iran rather than to Iron Age Mediterranean people. One theory suggests that these are Jews who were expelled during the Babylonian captivity and returned by the royal decree of the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great. Changes in morphology due to migration only were recorded in the past. Another theory suggests that these people were Jews who had intermarried before they returned to their homeland. The most plausible explanation for the Iranian-looking skulls is simply that these people originated in a non-Mediterranean region and most probably from Iran. They may have been the families of ex-soldiers or mercenaries.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, pp. 27‚Äì28, 31‚Äì33 =Later periods= Out of the poor remains of the Hellenistic period, it can be understood that the site housed human activity throughout the entire Hellenistic period (330‚Äì63 BCE), most of it between 250 BCE and 150 BCE. Four coins from this period were found. Three coins attributed to Ptolemy II Philadelphus, ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom were found. The first is a silver coin, bearing the face of Ptolemy himself, struck at the year 252 BCE in Acre. The second coin is a bronze coin, bearing the face of Zeus, struck between 246 and 271 BCE in Tyre. The third is essentially like the second but much smaller and its date unknown. Another coin is a much later bronze coin struck on 112‚Äì111 BCE. During this time Tel Qiri was under the rule of either the Seleucid Empire or the Hasmonean dynasty.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, p. 51 The remains from Roman times were quite poor. Not a single plan of a building could be reconstructed. The finds from the Early Roman period included many cooking pots and storage jars. The Early Roman settlement is dated from 63 BCE ‚Äì immediately after the Romans conquered the region ‚Äì to 25 CE. The latest settlement layer yields poor remains, including potsherds, which overlap in their date at between 300 and 350 CE, which is the proposed date of this layer. These can be dated as early as 230 CE and as late as 450 CE and even later.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, pp. 9-15 Sixteen Muslim burials were discovered, dug into the latest settlement layers from Roman and Hellenistic times. The faces of the deceased faced south, towards Mecca. Three of the burials yield remains such as beads and a stone pendant, which helps determine that most of the burials are from the 18th to 19th centuries CE, when the country was under Ottoman rule. Otherwise, one of the burials may be dated to the 13th century CE.Ben-Tor and Portugali, 1987, pp.7-8 A bronze coin from the Umayyad period was found, with the inscription \\"By the name of Allah this fils was struck at Tiberias\\".

Hip-Hop Therapy (HHT) is a contemporary approach in mental health treatment that takes into account the profound impact of Hip-Hop culture and its capacity to promote individual and communal transformation. Dr. Edgar Tyson (1963-2018) coined the term and created the foundational model in 1996, and Hip-Hop Therapy has evolved into a conceptual framework with significant global resonance. HHT refers to the purposeful use of Hip-Hop culture by a mental health professional within the context of the therapeutic relationship. The approach embodies a wide array of interventions that mix the inherently cathartic components of the culture with well- established treatment models, from music therapy, poetry therapy and other expressive therapies to cognitive behavioral therapy and narrative therapy. Hip-Hop Therapy is a culturally relevant remix of therapeutic conceptions that revitalizes the many merits of established forms that have traditionally overlooked disenfranchised populations. Origins Hip-Hop Therapy is rooted in the social work tradition as a strengths-based, culturally competent framework focused on fitting the model to the client. Although Hip-Hop has always been therapeutic for the communities that have produced it, Dr. Edgar Tyson founded the approach in attempts to systematically integrate the culture into mental health settings. In the mid-1990s, as a clinical social worker in a residential facility for homeless and justice-involved youth in Miami-Dade county, Tyson was inspired to incorporate Hip-Hop into individual and group therapy sessions. Upon witnessing the results, he decided to formally study the model's implementation, which would later be expounded upon in his pioneering scholarly article in 2002. After conducting his initial study in 1997, Tyson presented his model at the 30th Annual Conference of the National Association of Black Social Workers in 1998. Tyson (1998) would also present that year at the 20th Annual Symposium for the Association for the Advancement of Social Work with Groups, which would serve as a guide for Ciardiello's (2003) implementation of HHT, where the therapeutic act of creating different aspects of the culture was introduced to the literature base. According to Tyson (2002), the most significant finding of his exploratory study was that most of the youth expressed the desire to create their own songs to share and discuss in group, which he would then go on to facilitate. Ciardiello (2003) effectively built off of this implication for further research, as have several others since. Although Tyson's (2002) initial intervention focused primarily on Hip-Hop music, he emphasized that it \\"must be understood as one component and within the larger context of the hip hop culture,\\" which he referred to as the \\"central mechanism of HHT\\" (p. 134). Built within his founding model is the understanding that the music is but one artifact of a much larger culture and therefore cannot be analyzed in isolation. This is a key distinction that separates HHT from other rap music interventions, such as Elligan's (2000) contemporary Rap Therapy model. Thus, Hip-Hop Therapy represents the prospective inclusion of each cultural facet into the therapeutic process.

His role in the 1949 Yangtze River Crossing Campaign was adapted into the 1954 film Reconnaissance Across the Yangtze directed by Tang Xiaodan. He was awarded the rank of major general in 1955 and served as deputy chief of staff of the Fuzhou Military Region. He lived to the age of 107, the longest- lived founding general of the People's Republic of China.  Wartime career  Xiong was born in February 1912 in Yongding, Fujian, Republic of China. He enlisted in the Chinese Red Army in 1929, joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in 1931, and became a member of the Communist Party of China in 1933. After the Red Army went on the Long March toward Yan'an in North China, Xiong remained in the south and fought a guerrilla war against the Kuomintang government for three years. The Chinese Civil War was suspended with the Japan invasion in 1937, and Xiong joined the communist New Fourth Army and fought in the resistance war against Japan. Starting as a company commander in the Fourth Regiment of the army, he rose through the ranks to become battalion commissar, chief of staff of the New Third Regiment, political commissar of the 47th Regiment, and deputy commander of the Third Military Subdistrict of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Military District. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Chinese Civil War soon resumed. During the second phase of the war, Xiong served as commander of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui border region, and later as deputy commander of the South Anhui Military District. His forces played a major role in the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign of 1949. People's Republic of China After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Xiong served as deputy commander of the North Anhui Military District, chief of staff of an army corps, and deputy chief of staff of the Fujian Military District. He received the rank of major general in 1955, when the PRC awarded military ranks to its founding generals, and served as deputy chief of staff of the Fuzhou Military Region from 1959 to 1966. He disappeared from public life during the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976). After re-emerging in 1977, he again served as deputy chief of staff of the Fuzhou Military Region from 1980 to 1982. After Xiong retired in 1983, he repeatedly lobbied the national government to invest in infrastructure in the poverty-stricken areas of western Fujian, and helped win approval for the construction of the Meizhou- Kanshi railway () and the Ganzhou‚ÄìLongyan railway in the region. By the time Xiong celebrated his 107th birthday (108th in East Asian age reckoning) in February 2019, he had become the longest-living of China's founding generals.

W. Forester. She is most famous as the author of the 1902 style manual The Cult of Chiffon, and has been described as \\"one of the first truly outspoken high-profile fashion journalists.\\" Biography Marian Elizabeth Westropp-Dawson was born on 6 April 1869 to Walter Mountiford Westropp-Dawson and Laura Felicia Susan Clay. Her first husband was the paediatrician George Eric Campbell Pritchard (1864-1943), whom she married in 1894 and had a son with. When she began writing, she was known as Mrs. Eric Pritchard. The marriage ended in divorce in 1912, a petition from George Pritchard naming the Honourable Charles Cecil Orlando Weld-Forester as a co-respondent. On 1 April 1913, Marian married Weld-Forester, although continued writing as \\"Mrs. Eric Pritchard\\" until 1918, when The Daily Telegraph first noted she was now the Hon Mrs. C. W. Forester on 12 October 1918, and by December 21, noted that she was now \\"solely described\\" as Mrs C. W. Forester. Charles Weld-Forester died on 23 November 1937 at the age of 68, and Marian died, aged 76, on 1 December 1945. Career Writing as Mrs. Eric Pritchard, Marian was a regular columnist for The Lady and fashion editor for The Lady's Realm in the 1890s and 1900s. As a writer, Pritchard's work was noted for its sensuality and appreciation of the romantic and erotic potential of fashion, and how clothing could be used to present and construct the wearer's femininity. Her pieces for The Lady's Realm often discussed underwear at great length, arguing that even the most virtuous women could appreciate attractive lingerie without being accused of immorality. Pritchard compared the pursuit of chic and the appreciation of fashion to a modern-day religion, echoing her contemporaries such as the Comtesse de Tramar, who wrote books on beauty with purposefully religious- sounding titles such as Le Br√©viaire De La Femme (1903), and L'Evangile Profane: Rite F√©minin (The Profane Gospel: Female Rite, 1905). Whilst praising intelligence in a woman, both Pritchard and Tramar acknowledged the necessity of having to maintain one's appeal to a husband in order to preserve quality of life at that time, and encouraged their readers to combine their intelligence with clever dressing and good grooming. A contemporary review of Pritchard's Cult of Chiffon (1902) summarised this as \\"Man desires intelligence, but he hopes to find it clothed in becoming garments.\\" However, Pritchard's writing has also been criticised for showing \\"aggressive\\" and \\"conventional middle-class attitudes\\" and of using the language of \\"cultural terrorism\\" as defined by Pierre Bourdieu to attack athletic women and progressive or practical clothing. As a friend of Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, Pritchard moved in the same circles as the fashion designer Lucile and her sister, the novelist Elinor Glyn, which made her well-positioned to commentate on fashion for a society audience. In 1904, Pritchard started writing for The Daily Telegraph, for whom she wrote fashion columns and articles until May 1937. =The Cult of Chiffon= The Cult of Chiffon by Mrs. Eric Pritchard was a style manual intended to explain chic and stylish dressing, using the concept of the \\"Lady of Chiffon\\" to represent the New Woman of the early 20th century. The Lady of Chiffon was confident and self- assured, aware of her seductive femininity, and while she followed fashion with interest, she also enjoyed expressing her individualism and personal taste. The book was originally published by Grant Richards in 1902, with illustrations by Rose le Quesne, and dedicated to the Countess of Warwick. An unabridged reprint was produced by Dover Publications in 2017. The Cult of Chiffon is particularly noted for its emphasis on the importance of attractive underwear to a woman's self-esteem, and its role in maintaining successful marriages. Pritchard compared the enjoyment of wearing fine lingerie to loving art and poetry, arguing that it should be a universal right. When considering the unattractive but practical underwear of the 19th century such as grey coutil corsets and \\"drab\\" high-necked merino wool combinations, Pritchard bluntly stated that such \\"hideous\\" garments caused the failure of marriages, driving husbands to have affairs or go where they could \\"admire the petticoat of aspiration\\", and argued that women should prioritise beautiful underwear in their wardrobes. She gave advice for those on tight clothing budgets on how they could use cheap muslin and washable silk to make themselves attractive underwear. Despite the popularity of white undergarments, which Pritchard approved of, she also encouraged women to consider having their underwear in flattering shades of blue, pink and yellow, and even noted an emerging trend for black lingerie which could be flattering and effective if worn well. While black was often associated with mourning dress, Pritchard recommended that every woman, whatever their budget, should own at least one good, well-cut black dress for regular wear. Writing as Mrs. C. W. Forester, she published another style manual in 1925 titled Success Through Dress.

His request for asylum was granted and he remained a resident in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012. In 2019, an indictment from 2017 was made public following the termination of his asylum status and the subsequent arrest by the Metropolitan Police of UK in London. According to the indictment, Assange was accused of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in order to help Chelsea Manning gain access to privileged information which he intended to publish on Wikileaks. This is a less serious charge in comparison to those levelled against Manning, and carries a maximum sentence of five years with a possibility of parole. Assange was arrested on 11 April 2019 by the London Metropolitan Police for failing to appear in court and now faces possible extradition to the US. His arrest caught media attention, and news of it went viral on social media, especially on Twitter and Facebook as it involved the possibility that the founder of Wikileaks and its editor-in-chief would be brought to the US to face trial. Assange himself does not consent to extradition to the US, in an ongoing move to prevent this from happening. On 23 May 2019, a grand jury added 17 espionage charges related to his involvement with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, thus bringing a total of 18 federal charges against Assange in the US. On 15 July 2019, CNN reported that Assange had used the Ecuadorian embassy to meddle in the 2016 US Presidential election and had met with Russian and various hackers from around the world to do so. Background =Publication of material from Manning= Assange and some of his friends founded Wikileaks in 2006 and started visiting Europe, Asia, Africa and North America to look for, and publish, secret information concerning companies and governments that they felt should be made public. However, these leaks attracted little interest from law enforcement. In 2010, Assange was contacted by Chelsea Manning, who gave him classified information containing various military operations conducted by the US government abroad. The material included the Baghdad airstrike of 2007, Granai Airstrike of 2009, the Iraq War Logs, Afghan War Diaries, and the Afghan War Logs, among others. Part of these documents were published by Wikileaks and leaked to other major media houses including The Guardian between 2010 and 2011. Critics of the release included Julia Gillard, then Australian Prime Minister, who said the act was illegal, and the Vice- President of the United States, Joe Biden, who called him a terrorist.\\"WikiLeaks acting illegally, says Gillard,\\" Sydney Morning Herald, 2 December 2010.

Salon. 27 April 2011. Retrieved 15 March 2014. Assange broke bail to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning, and became a fugitive. The Australian government distanced itself from Assange.

Retrieved 29 August 2014. A warrant issued to Google by the district court cited several crimes, including espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, theft or conversion of property belonging to the United States government, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and general conspiracy. The indictment continued to remain sealed as of January 2019, although investigations seemed to have intensified as the case neared its statute of limitations. Arrest by the Metropolitan Police After Assange's asylum was revoked, the Ambassador of Ecuador to the UK invited the Metropolitan Police into the embassy on 11 April 2019. Following this invitation, Assange was arrested and taken to a central London police station. Assange was carrying Gore Vidal's History of the National Security State during his arrest. The news of the arrest went viral on Twitter and Facebook within minutes of its happening and several media outlets reported it as breaking news. President Moreno is quoted to have referred to Assange as a \\"spoiled brat\\" in the wake of the arrest. CNN reported that \\"British police entered the Ecuadorian Embassy in London... forcibly removing the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on a US extradition warrant and bringing his seven-year stint there to a dramatic close.\\" At a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court a few hours after his arrest, the presiding judge found Assange was guilty of breaching the terms of his bail. On 1 May 2019, Assange was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison. =Sealed indictment= In 2012 and 2013, US officials indicated that Assange was not named in a sealed indictment.Mark Hosenball, \\"Despite Assange claims, U.S. has no current case against him\\", Reuters, 22 August 2012. Retrieved 28 March 2014.Sari Horwitz, \\"Assange not under sealed indictment, U.S. officials say\\", The Washington Post, 18 November 2013. Retrieved 15 March 2014. On 6 March 2018, a federal grand jury for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a sealed indictment against Assange.Charlie Savage, Adam Goldman & Eileen Sullivan,Julian Assange Arrested in London as U.S. Unseals Hacking Conspiracy Indictment, The New York Times (11 April 2019). In November 2018, US prosecutors accidentally revealed that Assange had been indicted under seal in US federal court; the revelation came as a result of an error in a different court filing, unrelated to Assange. =Charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion= On 11 April 2019, the day of Assange's arrest in London, the indictment against him was unsealed. He was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion (i.e. hacking into a government computer), a relatively minor crime that carries a maximum 5-year sentence if found guilty. The charges stem from the allegation that Assange attempted and failed to crack a password hash so that Chelsea Manning could use a different username to download classified documents and avoid detection. This information had been known since 2011 and was a component of Manning's trial; the indictment did not reveal any new information about Assange. =Charges under the Espionage Act= On 23 May, Assange was indicted on 17 new charges relating to the Espionage Act of 1917 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Espionage Act charges carry a maximum sentence of 170 years in prison. The Obama administration had debated charging Assange under the Espionage Act but decided against it out of fear that it would have a negative effect on investigative journalism and could be unconstitutional. The new charges relate to obtaining and publishing the secret documents. Most of these charges relate to obtaining the secret documents. The three charges related to publication concern documents which revealed the names of sources in dangerous places putting them \\"at a grave and imminent risk\\" of harm or detention. The New York Times commented that it and other news organisations obtained the same documents as Wikileaks also without government authorisation. It also said it is not clear how Wikileaks's publications are legally different from other publications of classified information. Most cases brought under the Espionage Act have been against government employees who accessed sensitive information and leaked it to journalists and others. Prosecuting people for acts related to receiving and publishing information has not previously been tested in court. In 1975, the Justice Department decided after consideration not to charge journalist Seymour Hersh for reporting on US surveillance of the Soviet Union. Two lobbyists for a pro-Israel group were charged in 2005 with receiving and sharing classified information about American policy toward Iran. The charges however did not relate to the publication of the documents and the case was dropped by the Justice Department in 2009 prior to judgement. Assistant Attorney General John Demers said \\"Julian Assange is no journalist\\". The US allegation that Assange's publication of these secrets was illegal was deemed controversial by Australia's Seven News as well as CNN. The Cato Institute also questioned the US government's position which attempts to position Assange as not a journalist. The Associated Press said Assange's indictment presented media freedom issues, as Assange's solicitation and publication of classified information is a routine job journalists perform. Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, stated that what Assange is accused of doing is factually different from but legally similar to what professional journalists do. Vladeck also said the Espionage Act charges could provide Assange with an argument against extradition under the US-UK treaty as there is an exemption in the treaty for political offences. Forbes magazine stated that the US government created outcry among journalists in its indictment of Assange as the US sought to debate if Assange was a journalist or not. Suzanne Nossel of PEN America said it was immaterial if Assange was a journalist or publisher and pointed instead to first amendment concerns. Freedom of expression and information Several jurists, politicians, associations, academics and campaigners consider that the arrest of Assange constitutes an attack on freedom of the press and international law. =Freedom of expression and information in UK and Europe= Assange is the publisher of WikiLeaks, recognised as a \\"media organisation\\" in 2017 by a UK tribunal, contradicting public assertions to the contrary by some US officials, and possibly supporting Assange's efforts to oppose his extradition to the United States. This is why the Dutch senator Tiny Kox asked the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatovic, whether the arrest of Assange and his possible extradition to the US are inline with the criteria of the European Convention on Human Rights, because Assange can benefit from the protection of the right to freedom of expression and information according to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Eva Joly, magistrate and MEP, states that \\"the arrest of Julian Assange is an attack on freedom of expression, international law and right to asylum\\". Sevim Dagdelen, a German Bundestag MP who specialises in international law and press law, describes the whistleblower's arrest as \\"an attack on independent journalism\\" and says that he \\"is today seriously endangered\\". Dick Marty, a former attorney general of Ticino and rapporteur on the CIA's secret prisons for the Council of Europe, considers the arrest of whistleblowers \\"very shocking\\". Several well-known Swiss jurists have asked the Federal Council to grant asylum to the founder of Wikileaks because he is threatened with extradition to the United States, which in the past \\"silenced whistleblowers\\". British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed \\"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\\" and his extradition to the United States \\"should be opposed by the British government\\". Bolivian President Evo Morales and Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also condemned it. Independent United Nations rights experts such as Agnes Callamard said \\"the arrest of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange by police in the United Kingdom, after the Ecuadorian Government decided to stop granting him asylum in their London embassy, exposed him to the risk of serious human rights violations, if extradited to the United States\\". According to Amnesty International's Massimo Moratti, if extradited to the United States, Assange may face the \\"risk of serious human rights violations, namely detention conditions, which could violate the prohibition of torture\\". =Freedom of expression and information in US= While US politicians encourage the arrest and indicment of Julian Assange, several non-governmental organisation of press freedom condemn it. Ecuadorian president Len√≠n Moreno, the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the British Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, U.S. Senator Mark Warner, Hillary Clinton campaign advisor Neera Tanden, and British Prime Minister Theresa May, who commented that \\"no one is above the law,\\" are in support of the arrest. Alternatively, it has been asserted that such a move would be a threat to freedom of speech as protected by the first amendment to the US Constitution. This view is held by Edward Snowden, Daniel Ellsberg, Rafael Correa, Chelsea Manning, Jeremy Corbyn, Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch, and Glenn Greenwald, who said \\"it's the criminalization of journalism\\". Ecuadorean president Len√≠n Moreno said in a video posted on Twitter that he \\"requested Great Britain to guarantee that Mr Assange would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty. The British government has confirmed it in writing, in accordance with its own rules.\\" On 14 April 2019, however, Moreno stated in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian that no other nation influenced his government's decision to revoke Assange's asylum in the embassy and that Assange did in fact use facilities in the embassy \\"to interfere in processes of other states.\\" Moreno also stated \\"we can not allow our house, the house that opened its doors, to become a centre for spying\\" and noted that Assange also had poor hygiene. Moreno further stated \\"We never tried to expel Assange, as some political actors want everyone to believe. Given the constant violations of protocols and threats, political asylum became untenable.\\" On 11 April 2019, Moreno described Assange as a \\"bad mannered\\" guest who physically assaulted embassy security guards. Mark Warner, vice-chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, welcomed the arrest of Assange, saying that Assange is \\"a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security\\". The president of the Center for American Progress and former Obama aide Neera Tanden also welcomed the arrest and condemned Assange's leftist supporters, tweeting that \\"the Assange cultists are the worst. Assange was the agent of a proto-fascist state, Russia, to undermine democracy. That is fascist behaviour. Anyone on the left should abhor what he did.\\" According to the editorial in The Times \\"the prosecution of Mr Assange could become an assault on the First Amendment and whistle- blowers\\". Ben Wizner from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) speculated that if authorities were to prosecute Assange \\"for violating US secrecy laws [it] would set an especially dangerous precedent for US journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\\" The Reporters Without Borders said Assange's arrest could \\"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistle-blowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future.\\" Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, wrote that Assange's prosecution for publishing leaked documents is \\"a major threat to global media freedom\\". Freedom of the Press Foundation said: \\"Whether or not you like Assange, the charge against him is a serious press freedom threat and should be vigorously protested by all those who care about the first amendment.\\" The French Union of Journalists (), said that \\"the dissemination of documents or information of public interest\\" could not be considered a legal offence. The union called on Britain \\"to refuse the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States and to release him.\\" NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg and former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa condemned Assange's arrest. Snowden tweeted that \\"Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom.\\" Daniel Ellsberg said \\"Forty-eight years ago, I was the first journalistic source to be indicted. There have been perhaps a dozen since then, nine under President Obama. But Julian Assange is the first journalist to be indicted. If he is extradited to the U.S. and convicted, he will not be the last.The First Amendment is a pillar of our democracy and this is an assault on it. If freedom of speech is violated to this extent, our republic is in danger. Unauthorized disclosures are the lifeblood of the republic.\\" According to Ron Paul, Assange should receive the same kind of protections as the mainstream media when it comes to releasing information. He said \\"In a free society we're supposed to know the truth ... In a society where truth becomes treason, then we're in big trouble. And now, people who are revealing the truth are getting into trouble for it.\\" He added \\"This is media, isn't it? I mean, why don't we prosecute The New York Times or anybody that releases this?\\" The yellow vests movement called for Assange's release. =Criticism of Espionage indictment= Widespread criticism from the news media and other public advocates ensued following Assange's arrest on Espionage charges. Multiple organisations and journalists criticised Assange's arrest as a journalist citing first amendment claims. *The New York Times state \\"Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks leader, has been indicted on 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act for his role in obtaining and publishing secret military and diplomatic documents in 2010, the Justice Department announced on Thursday ‚Äî a novel case that raises profound First Amendment issues.\\" *The Guardian said: \\"By bringing new charges against the WikiLeaks founder, the Trump administration has challenged the first amendment\\" *Edward Snowden said: The Department of Justice just declared war‚Äì‚Äì¬Ä¬înot on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself. This is no longer about Julian Assange: This case will decide the future of media. *HuffPost said: \\"The charges against the WikiLeaks founder bring up huge First Amendment issues.\\" *The Nation said: \\"The Indictment of Julian Assange Is a Threat to Press Freedom.\\" *The American Civil Liberties Union said: \\"For the first time in the history of our country, the government has brought criminal charges under the Espionage Act against a publisher for the publication of truthful information. This is a direct assault on the First Amendment.\\" *Jonathan Turley described the Assange indictment under the Espionage Act of 1917 as \\"the most important press freedom case in the US in 300 years\\". Aftermath of his arrest =Indictments and possible extradition to the US= Immediately following the arrest of Assange, the Eastern District of Virginia grand jury unsealed the indictment it had brought against him. According to the indictment, Assange was accused of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in order to assist Chelsea Manning gaining access to privileged information which he intended to publish on WikiLeaks. This is a less serious charge than those levelled against Manning, and carries a maximum sentence of five years. Assange was arrested in April after being carried out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had been living since 2012, avoiding an international arrest warrant, was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison by a British judge on 1 May 2019. Judge Deborah Taylor said Assange's time in the embassy had cost British taxpayers the equivalent of nearly $21 million, and that he had sought asylum in a \\"deliberate attempt to delay justice.\\" Assange offered a written apology in court, claiming that his actions were a response to terrifying circumstances. He said he had been effectively imprisoned in the embassy; two doctors also provided medical evidence of the mental and physical effects of being confined. To which the judge Deborah Taylor said \\"You were not living under prison conditions, and you could have left at any time to face due process with the rights and protections which the legal system in this country provides\\". On 23 May 2019, Assange was indicted, in a superseding indictment, under the Espionage Act of 1917, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for offences relating to the publication of diplomatic cables and other sensitive information. In the past the Act was used to charge Socialist congressman and newspaper editor Victor L. Berger, Emma Goldman and Eugene V. Debs. The 23 May indictment adds 17 federal charges to the earlier federal indictment, thus bringing a total of 18 federal criminal charges against Assange from the US federal government with a sentence of up to 175 years in prison.https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/julian- assange-charged-18-count-indictment-wikileaks-disclosures/story?id=63234593 The charges are related to his involvement with Chelsea Manning, a former US Army intelligence analyst who gave Assange classified information concerning matters surrounding the US Defense Department. On 25 March 2020, a London court denied Assange bail after Judge Vanessa Baraitser rejected his lawyers' argument that his stay in prison would put him at high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to his previous respiratory tract infections and a heart problem. Judge Baraitser said that Assange's past conduct showed how far he was willing to go to avoid extradition to the United States. In late June 2020, the United States Justice Department expanded the indictment against Assange.Milligan, Ellen (29 June 2020). Julian Assange Lawyers Say New U.S. Indictment Could Derail Extradition. MSN News via Bloomberg News. Archived from the original on 2 July 2020. Retrieved 2 July 2020. =Extradition hearings= On 25 February 2020, Edward Fitzgerald, one of the barristers representing Assange, revealed to District Judge Vanessa Baraitser that Dana Rohrabacher as an emissary of President Donald Trump had offered Assange a pardon from President Trump if Assange could offer material identifying the source of email leaks from the Democratic National Committee during 2016. =Revelations about use of Ecuadorian Embassy= On 15 July 2019, CNN obtained documents from an Ecuadorian intelligence official which confirmed that Assange used the embassy as the command center for Wikileaks. =Reactions to the indictment= Several jurists, politicians, associations, academics and campaigners viewed the arrest of Assange as an attack on freedom of the press and international law. The Reporters Without Borders said Assange's arrest could \\"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistle-blowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future.\\" Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, wrote that Assange's prosecution for publishing leaked documents is \\"a major threat to global media freedom\\". United Nations rights expert Agnes Callamard said the arrest of Assange exposed him to the risk of serious human rights violations, if extradited to the United States. Reactions in the UK and the EU Dutch senator Tiny Kox (Socialist Party) asked the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatoviƒá, whether the arrest of Assange and his possible extradition to the US were in line with the criteria of the European Convention on Human Rights. In January 2020, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted to oppose Assange's extradition to the US. In 2019, British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed \\"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\\" and his extradition to the United States \\"should be opposed by the British government\\". In February 2020, Corbyn again praised Assange, demanding a halt to the extradition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded vaguely with \\"it‚Äôs obvious that the rights of journalists and whistleblowers should be upheld and this government will continue to do that.‚Äù Eva Joly, magistrate and MEP for Europe Ecology‚ÄìThe Greens, said that \\"the arrest of Julian Assange is an attack on freedom of expression, international law and right to asylum\\". Sevim Dagdelen, a German Bundestag MP for The Left who specialises in international law and press law, describes Assange's arrest as \\"an attack on independent journalism\\" and says that he \\"is today seriously endangered\\". Dick Marty, a former state prosecutor of Ticino and rapporteur on the CIA's secret prisons for the Council of Europe, considers the arrest of whistleblowers \\"very shocking\\". Several well- known Swiss jurists have asked the Federal Council to grant asylum to the founder of Wikileaks because he is threatened with extradition to the United States, which in the past \\"silenced whistleblowers\\". The French Union of Journalists (), said that \\"the dissemination of documents or information of public interest\\" could not be considered a legal offence. The union called on Britain \\"to refuse the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States and to release him.\\" In a letter,the two French Unions of Journalists () and () asked Emmanuel Macron to enforce Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. According them, \\"Faced with threats to Julian Assange's health and at the risk of seeing him sentenced to life imprisonment, we are saying loud and clear, with the IFJ (F√©d√©ration internationale des journalistes) that 'journalism is not a crime'\\". They add: The yellow vests movement called for Assange's release. Reactions in the US While some US politicians supported the arrest and indictment of Julian Assange, several non- governmental organisations of press freedom condemned it. Mark Warner, vice- chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, welcomed the arrest of Assange, saying that Assange was \\"a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security\\". The president of the Center for American Progress and former Obama aide Neera Tanden also welcomed the arrest and condemned Assange's leftist supporters, tweeting that \\"the Assange cultists are the worst. Assange was the agent of a proto-fascist state, Russia, to undermine democracy. That is fascist behaviour. Anyone on the left should abhor what he did.\\" The deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Robert Mahoney, said \\"With this prosecution of Julian Assange, the US government could set out broad legal arguments about journalists soliciting information or interacting with sources that could have chilling consequences for investigative reporting and the publication of information of public interest.\\" According to Yochai Benkler, a Harvard law professor, the charge sheet contained some \\"very dangerous elements that pose significant risk to national security reporting. Sections of the indictment are vastly overbroad and could have a significant chilling effect ‚Äì they ought to be rejected.\\" Carrie DeCell, staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the charges \\"risk having a chill on journalism\\". She added, \\"Many of the allegations fall absolutely within the first amendment's protections of journalistic activity. That's very troubling to us.\\" Ben Wizner from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) speculated that if authorities were to prosecute Assange \\"for violating US secrecy laws [it] would set an especially dangerous precedent for US journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\\" NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg condemned the indictment. Snowden tweeted that \\"Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom.\\" Daniel Ellsberg said: According to Ron Paul, Assange should receive the same kind of protections as the mainstream media when it comes to releasing information. He said \\"In a free society we're supposed to know the truth ... In a society where truth becomes treason, then we're in big trouble. And now, people who are revealing the truth are getting into trouble for it.\\" He added \\"This is media, isn't it? I mean, why don't we prosecute The New York Times or anybody that releases this?\\" Reactions in Australia In October 2019, former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce called for the federal government to take action to stop Assange being extradited from the United Kingdom to the US. Later in October, the cross-party Bring Assange Home Parliamentary Working Group was established. Its co-chairs are independent Andrew Wilkie and Liberal National MP George Christensen. Its members include Greens Richard Di Natale, Adam Bandt and Peter Whish-Wilson, Centre Alliance MPs Rebekha Sharkie and Rex Patrick and independent Zali Steggall. In the lead up to an extradition hearing on 1 June 2020, more than 100 politicians, journalists, lawyers and human rights activists from Australia wrote to Foreign Minister Marise Payne asking her to make urgent representations to the UK government to have Assange released on bail due to his ill-health. Other reactions Former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa condemned Assange's arrest. Bolivian President Evo Morales also condemned it. Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, condemned the indictment. The ex- President of Brazil Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva said that \\"Humanity should demand its freedom. Instead of being imprisoned he should be treated like a hero\\", during his visit in Genebra. On Assange's birthday in July 2020, 40 organizations including the International Federation of Journalists, the National Union of Journalists, the National Lawyers Guild, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the Centre for Investigative Journalism and the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters wrote an open letter demanding that Assange be released.

She was a retainer of Ry≈´z≈çji clan, after her husband and Ry≈´z≈çji Takanobu was slain in the Battle of Okitanawate, she became the head of Kamafunatsu castle and Hyakutake clan.  Life  Born in 1553, she was the wife of Hyakutake Tomokane, the castellan of Kamafunatsu castle. Hyakutake (meaning \\"100 warriors\\"), who served the Ry≈´z≈çji clan, was given his last name because his valour in battle was so great that he was said to have the skill of 100 warriors. During battles against the ≈åtomo clan, Miyohime wielded a naginata and led soldiers into battle herself in order to defend their castle. In 1570, Miyohime assisted Nabeshima Naoshige in defending Saga Castle when it was surrounded by a 60,000-man ≈åtomo clan army, and it is said that she commanded standing soldiers at the door. When Ry≈´z≈çji Takanobu attacked the Arima clan in 1582, Shimazu Yoshihisa declared war against the Ry≈´z≈çji clan. In the Battle of Okitanawate on May 3, 1584, the Shimazu and Arima army commanded by Shimazu Iehisa marched to Shimabara. The Ry≈´z≈çji army was well armed with muskets and intimidated the enemy. Miyohime and her husband were part of the siege defense. When the Shimazu enticed the Ry≈´z≈çji into a false retreat, Takanobu led his troops to pursue the Shimazu. Many Shimazu soldiers attacked Takanobu from behind and beheaded him. Tomokane died in the battle. Miyohime heard the death of Takanobu first, and believed it was certain that her husband had also been killed. She became a Buddhist nun and changed her name to Enky≈´-ni. However, Naoshige ordered her to defend her husband's castle, so she re-entered Kamafunatsu castle with a small garrison. In September, Tachibana D≈çsetsu and Takahashi J≈çun rebelled against Ry≈´z≈çji clan. Miyohime successfully defended Kamafunatsu castle, clearing the enemy with reinforcements from Nakano Kiyoaki. After the victory, on the grounds that being a nun made her unsuitable to be castellan, she renounced her role of castellan. After resigning her military career, she probably lived as a Buddhist nun until the last day of her life. Enky≈´-ni survived the entire Period of Warring States, dying on August 16, 1615, months after the Siege of Osaka, the final battle that ended the Sengoku period and initiated the Tokugawa shogunate.ÁôæÊ≠¶ÂøóÊë©ÂÆà„Å®Âúì‰πÖÂ∞º  See also  * List of female castellans in Japan  References   Bibliography  * ‰ΩêË≥ÄÊñ∞ËÅûÁ§æ (2006/12).„Äé‰∫îÂ∑û‰∫åÂ≥∂„ÅÆÂ§™ÂÆàÈæçÈÄ†ÂØ∫ÈöÜ‰ø°„Äè.

Mixed doubles is the most common format of doubles curling, where the term 'mixed' specifies that each team is composed of one man and one woman. The term mixed is also used to describe a specific format of 4-person team curling where the team consists of two men and two women and the throwing order alternates genders, see mixed team. With its smaller teams and quicker games, doubles curling has provided an opportunity for more countries to participate in international competition. At the 2019 World Mixed Doubles Championship 48 of the 61 World Curling Federation member countries were represented, including the first international curling competition for Kosovo, Ukraine, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico.  History  The idea was developed by Curling Canada's Warren Hansen in 2001 to be one of four discipline variations for the inaugural Continental Cup of Curling. The first World Mixed Doubles Championship took place in 2008. Since its inception, Switzerland has won six of the first ten titles. Russia and Hungary have won their first world curling titles in the mixed doubles championship, and New Zealand, France, Austria, and the Czech Republic won their first world curling medals. The IOC did not approve the events for inclusion into the 2010 Winter Olympics, but an attempt to include the mixed doubles in the following winter Olympiad succeeded, making its Olympic debut at the 2018 Winter Olympics. John Morris and Kaitlyn Lawes won the first mixed doubles gold medal for Canada, defeating Switzerland in the final. The Olympic Athletes from Russia won the bronze medal match only to have their medal stripped from them after Alexander Krushelnitsky failed a drug test. Team Norway, who had finished fourth, was then awarded the bronze medal.  Rules of play  In doubles curling each two person team plays with six stones, one of which is positioned in play before the start of the end. One stone is placed on the center line in the 4-foot circle of the house such that the back edge of the stone is aligned with the back edge of the circle. The other positioned stone is placed on the center line as a guard in front of the house. The exact placement of this positioned guard is chosen from six possible locations and must be agreed upon by the teams before the game. The six possible locations are immediately in front of and behind three points along the center line, the midpoint between the hog line and the front of the house and 3 feet in front of and behind that midpoint. The teams decide on the guard location based on ice conditions, such as the amount of curl expected, and the same location must be used the entire game. The team that did not score in the previous end decides which team's stone is placed in the house and which team's stone is placed as a guard. The team whose positioned stone is the guard throws the first stone that end. If there was no score the previous end then the team that threw the first stone gets to decide which team's stone goes where; this means that unlike traditional team curling the team with the hammer does not usually get to keep it if the end is blanked. The team that has the decision on the placement of the positioned stones also has the option to use their power play. Each team may use the power play only once per game and it cannot be during an extra end. The power play allows the positioned stones to be moved to the side of the sheet (which side is at the discretion of the team using the power play) with the back edge of the stone in the house positioned on the tee line where the 8-foot and 12-foot circles meet and the guard correspondingly moved to the side of the guard zone. Of the five stones each team delivers during an end, one player throws the first and last stone while the other player must throw the three in between. Unlike traditional curling the throwing order may change between ends. The player that is not delivering the stone may act as a sweeper or as skip at the far end. The player throwing the stone often gets up after releasing the stone to sweep. No stone, including those in the house, can be removed from play prior to the delivery of the fourth stone of an end. If there is a violation, the delivered stone is removed from play and any stones moved are returned to their original position by the non-offending team. The game is scored the same as traditional curling, where the team with a stone in the house closest to the button scores one point for every stone in the house closer to the button than the closest opposing stone.  Rule changes  * 2008: Mixed doubles rules formalized by World Curling Federation. * 2015: Positioned stone in the house is moved from just behind tee line to just in front of the back edge of the 4-foot. Teams are no longer separated to opposite ends of the sheet at the start of delivery. A stone delivered out of rotation is \\"burned\\" instead of rethrown. Power play is introduced. * 2019: Blank due to equal measurement no longer gives up hammer/positioned stone placement decision.

Since almost the beginning of settlement in the area by European descendants, the St. Anthony Falls have been used for waterpower. The first allowed settlers were at Ft. Snelling, where construction began in 1820. A sawmill was operating 1821 and a flour mill in 1823. As soon as the land at the sides of the falls became available it was purchased with the intent of using the waterpower of the falls. First lumber mills covered the falls, cutting lumber floated down the Mississippi. After 1870 flour mills started to dominate the area. From 1880 to 1930 the area was the number one flour producer in the US. In later years, some of the power came from steam, but in 1923 half of the waterpower used was for flour milling. Other industries have also used the waterpower. Hydroelectric production started very early in 1881, and the companies that owned the waterpower rights encouraged or developed three early major hydroelectric plants 1894/1911, 1895 and 1908. For comparison, the first large scale production of electricity in the world was at the Adams (Tesla) plant at Niagara Falls starting 1895, which used alternating current. Large scale generation was not practical before alternating current was used. After the third plant was in operation in 1908, 45% of the waterpower being used was for hydroelectric. One of the historic St. Anthony Falls plants is still operating. Many of the features in this article are contributing resources to the St. Anthony Falls Historic District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.  Origin of St Anthony Falls  About 13,000 years ago Glacial River Warren drained Glacial Lake Agassiz in a huge flow of water that produced a waterfall that progressed up the Mississippi, then up the Minnesota River. As it passed through St. Paul 13,000 years ago, the waterfall was a barely imaginable 2700 ft wide and 175 ft high. When the waterfall went past the Mississippi - Minnesota River confluence 10,000 years ago it left an approximately 180 ft high waterfall from the Mississippi river to the north. That waterfall progressed up the Mississippi producing a deep gorge and the remains of the waterfall is at St. Anthony Falls. To protect the falls from imminent destruction from the Eastman Tunnel \\"Nomination of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District to be on the National Register of Historic Places\\": 1971, 1991; \\"Contributing resource\\" to the St. Anthony Falls Historic District disaster, the falls were encased in a concrete apron and spillway. The \\"Horseshoe\\" (Upper) Dam built on top of the falls was partly to increase the waterpower available, but also keeps the limestone layer that forms the falls wet, protecting it. The power that can be derived from a falls (or dam) is determined by the flow rate and \\"head\\". The head is the difference in elevation between the pond above the falls and the water level below the falls. At St. Anthony falls the head is 49 ft., including the falls and the horseshoe dam. The head (lift) at the Ford dam (Lock and Dam No. 1) 6 miles downstream is 38 ft., and that is the largest (or tied) lift/head at any dam downstream on the Mississippi. The natural drop in elevation in the short 6 miles that includes the falls, the lower dam and the Ford dam is 97 ft, or 111 ft. if the horseshoe dam is included. Use \\"USGS Topo\\". The few elevations on the map above and below dams were the same as in List of locks and dams of the Upper Mississippi River All of that is the remains of the 'great waterfall'. And it is over 25% of the change in elevation from St. Anthony Falls to below the last lock and dam on the Mississippi.  Waterpower rights  Rights to use the St. Anthony Falls waterpower was controlled by the owners of the land on the west and east bank The Minneapolis Mill Company (west bank) and the St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company (east bank) were chartered by the territorial legislature of Minnesota in 1856, and each was granted a perpetual right to use half the water flowing in the river.

Other than that, directions are normal compass directions.  Brush Electric Central Station 1882  In 1881 the Pillsbury \\"A\\" Mill added a hydroelectric Brush Electric plant, which may have been the first installation in a flour mill in the world. The Washburn mill and several other buildings installed their own Brush Systems. The Brush Systems were a generator that powered arc-lights (this was just before incandescent lights were practical). Coordinates: Approximate The Minnesota Brush Electric Co., built a plant on Upton Island, on the west bank. It produced power starting September 1882 eventually using five water powered Brush generators., and became the first hydroelectric \\"Central Station\\" (supplying multiple users) hydroelectric plant in the US. Soon Minneapolis street lights were added, including a 257 ft high tower at Bridge Square. For comparison, Edison's Pearl Street Station also started producing electric power September 1882 (using steam). Not only is the Brush central station long gone, the remains of Upton Island were removed when the locks were installed in the 1960s. Waterpower was not entirely reliable, so in 1894 the generators were moved to the West Side Power Plant \\"Nomination of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District to be on the National Register of Historic Places\\": 1971, 1991; \\"Contributing resource\\" to the St. Anthony Falls Historic District near 3rd Avenue North and West River Road This was the first steam powered electric plant in Minneapolis. In 1886 generators were added for incandescent lights. In 1895 the generators were moved to the Main Street Station.  Main Street Station 1894 1911  Coordinates: 1911 Main Street Station with Pillsbury \\"A\\" Mill behind William de la Barre was the chief engineer for the waterpower companies. He was interested in maximizing the efficiency of waterpower use at the west side of the falls. One way was to maximize the \\"head\\" used by enlarging the headrace water power canal and making sure the turbines were near the water level below the falls. The goal was to use the entire \\"head\\". The west bank \\"power canal\\" supplied water to numerous mills. The east bank was less effective in waterpower use. It had a tunnel that supplied the huge Pillsbury A-mill plus another mill. Plus there were sawmills that operated at the edge of the falls. De la Barre saw the potential of using the hydropower to generate electricity. He offered to lease some hydropower to Minneapolis General Electric. GE combined that with other waterrights, including from sawmills that had burned down, and built the Main Street Station at the falls, constructed 1894-1895. About 38% of the generation was from waterpower (the rest was steam). The original station burned down and a new one was built in 1911 \\"Nomination of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District to be on the National Register of Historic Places\\": 1971, 1991; \\"Contributing resource\\" to the St. Anthony Falls Historic District that used only hydropower for three 480 kW generators. The Plant was the \\"main generating facility\\" for the city, so Minneapolis General Electric wanted the plant back in operation rapidly. That resulted in a plant that was significantly more primitive than the 1908 Hennepin Island Hydroelectric Plant built three years earlier. The turbines survived the fire and were reused. That required the new generators be powered by a \\"rope drive\\" (rope used as a drive belt), and the electrical production was far smaller than the Hennepin Island Plant. The Station continued to produce electricity until 1968 Shown in the picture, the plant is very visible at 206 Main St.. One side, with intake gates, is against the upper pond. A dam was built in 2000 to protect that side (it is now the access to a Water Power Park). FERC Online eLibrary, Docket: P-2056, search for: May 25, 2011, Application for non-capacity amendment Includes history of hydroelectric projects The visible part of the plant is above the limestone cap that forms the Falls. The east-side channel of the river (around Hennepin Island) used to flow through where the Plant is and over the east-channel Falls \\"Nomination of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District to be on the National Register of Historic Places\\": 1971, 1991; \\"Contributing resource\\" to the St. Anthony Falls Historic District about 300 ft. downstream from the Plant. The Plant was built between Hennepin Island and the east bank.  Lower dam 1895 1953 2011  Coordinates: Right after the Main Street Station, de la Barre built a \\"lower dam\\" and the lower dam hydroelectric powerhouse about a half mile below the falls. Construction was 1895-1897. This was the first dam built exclusively for hydroelectric generation in Minnesota. and had a much larger electrical capacity plant than any other plant in the state. The plant also used an innovative horizontal shaft direct mechanical connection between turbines and generators instead of a belt drive common previously. Power was sold to the streetcar company (TCRT), which was replacing old streetcars with electric streetcars starting 1889. Generation was 35 Hz (8 generators) and DC (2 generators), 8.5 megawatt. About 1950 electric streetcars were replaced by buses and The TCRT no longer bought power. In addition, the Corps of Engineers rebuilt the dam adding a lock and auxiliary lock, and creating a higher 24 ft. head. As a result, the powerhouse was replaced (1950-1953) The new plant was 60 Hz, 8.25 megawatts, 10 generators using a vertical shaft. In 1987 a large hole eroded under the powerplant that drained the upper pond. The powerhouse was damaged and was removed 1988. Reconstructing a powerplant was determined to not be feasible. (The lower dam is outside the St. Anthony Falls Historic District.)

Hennepin Island Hydroelectric Plant 1908  Coordinates: Hennepin Island Hydroelectric Plant and tailrace In yet another De la Barre project, 1906-1908 he designed and built the Hennepin Island Hydroelectric Plant.\\"Nomination of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District to be on the National Register of Historic Places\\": 1971, 1991; \\"Contributing resource\\" to the St. Anthony Falls Historic District It is located near the center of Hennepin Island and is not very visible. A 400 ft. headrace canal connects the plant to the upper pond.. The plant was the first in the US to use \\"surplus power\\". Waterpower users had a right to a specified flow. The plant operated on flow that was above that total amount. The plant originally produced power at 35 Hz, 9.9 megawatts, using four horizontal shaft direct drive generators. The total output was leased to Minneapolis General Electric who subleased it to the streetcar system. In 1955 as streetcars were replaced by buses the plant was converted to 60 Hz and a fifth generator was added for a total capacity of 12.4 megawatts. The fifth generator was vertical shaft, with the turbine below the generator. This places the turbine at a lower level than horizontal shaft setups, which allows the available head to be better used. Vertical shaft installations were not practical until bearings were developed that could bear the weight of the generator rotor. The rotating turbine \\"runners\\" were replaced and generators were rewound, completed 2013. The historic turbine outer shells were not affected. The changes raised the capacity from 12.4 megawatts to 13.9 megawatts and raised the maximum flow from 4,025 cfs to 4,366 cfs. This the only historic plant still in operation.

Northern States Power  Northern States Power Co is the corporate successor to the historic hydroelectric projects in this article, and wound up with the historic assets - three hydroelectric plants (one still operating, one demolished) and most of the water rights. The St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company built the Lower Dam and Hydroelectric Plant, then the Hennepin Island Hydroelectric Plant. The St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company and Minneapolis Mill Company merged into the Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Company in 1889. Assets wound up with Pillsbury Flour Mills Company in 1923, and that year the waterpower companies (and the Lower Dam Hydroelectric Plant, and Hennepin Island Hydroelectric Plant and the waterpower rights) were sold to a subsidiary of Northern States Power. The waterpower companies became a direct part of NSP in 1937. The Minnesota Brush Electric Company was absorbed by the Minneapolis General Electric Co. by 1893. In 1912 Consumers Power acquired the Minneapolis General Electric Company (and Main Street Station). Consumers Power reorganized in 1916 and became Northern States Power NSP became part of Xcel Energy in 2000 through mergers. It is now Northern States Power Company (d/b/a Xcel Energy).  Water over the falls  The 2004 FERC license renewal for NSP (the Hennepin Island Power Plant) requires a minimum flow over the Falls 2 inches deep. That translates to a flow of about 100 cfs (cubic feet per second). If the flow drops below that NSP has to reduce its water flow. The requirement actually is that the flow is required only when people are likely to be present, during daylight, and not in the winter. The revised A-mill FERC licence allows the A-mill to use water when there is flow more than what NSP requires, with the same requirement of 100 cfs over the Falls. The 2004 NSP license renewal also requires that NSP execute an Aesthetic Flow Adequacy Plan that determines what the flow should be. That includes opinion surveys from people at the falls using pictures of different flow rates. The report from NSP to FERC was issued March 30, 2017 and recommends a minimum flow of 300 cfs all the time. FERC Online eLibrary, Docket: P-2056, search for: March 30, 2017, Aesthetic Flow Adequacy Plan The Minneapolis Park Board, and others, want a minimum flow of 2000 cfs.

Crown Hydro couldn't come to an agreement with the building owner. Crown Hydro then proposed a license change locating the generators at the former Fuji-Ya Restaurant site. The Minneapolis Park Board said it owned the site and opposed the change. FERC determined that the Park Board did own the site and Crown Hydro had no way to use it. Crown Hydro then proposed another license change locating the generators about 250 ft. north of the Crown Roller Mill on property owned by the Corps of Engineers (associated with the locks). This location results in potential impact to numerous historic properties, particularly from a new tailrace tunnel. That requires a Section 106 review (which protects historically significant properties such as the Ida Dorsey Bordello). Review is ongoing. There is, however, strong opposition to this project, including by the Park Board.

They were removed from service in 1960 after fatigue analysis revealed that the fuselage structure at the wing attachment point had only a short life. Design and development In 1948 Hungarian National Flying Association (OMRE), which in 1951 became the Hungarian Aeronautical Association (MRSz), invited tenders for a two seat primary glider. The Z-03 Ifj√∫s√°g won the contract for 100 aircraft, with a design by Ferenc Zseb≈ë capable of exploiting thermals and performing basic aerobatics. Its first flight was in February 1953. There were two production variants, the Z-03A and the Z-03B. The Z-03 had a wooden, single spar mid-mounted wing which was trapezoidal in plan, with plywood covering ahead of the spar forming a torsion resistant D-box, and with fabric covering aft. On the Z-03A, the inner halves of the trailing edges were occupied by split flaps and the rest with Frise- balanced ailerons. Just inboard of the ailerons G√∂ppingen-type spoilers, mounted aft of the spar at 40% chord, opened both above and below the wing. The Z-03B had no flaps. Structurally, the fuselage of both Z-03 variants was all-metal and built in two distinct halves. The differences were in the forward parts which stretched from nose to wing trailing edge. The forward part of the Z-03A's fuselage was a welded steel-tube structure with light alloy formers to shape the fabric covering. Its cockpit held two seats in tandem. The forward position was provided with instruments and the rear seat was over the c.g., so the aircraft could be flown solo from the front with or without a rear-seat occupant. The two seats were covered by a one-piece, rear- hinged canopy. The Z-03A's landing gear had an exposed, rubber sprung nosewheel and a semi-exposed mainwheel under mid-chord. The Z-03B had a new forward fuselage, longer and wider and of light alloy monocoque structure. The roomier cockpit had a lower, side-opening canopy, lengthened at the back and the rear seat was instrumented, opening the possibility of blind-flying training. The landing gear of the Z-03B was similar to that of the earlier variant but the mainwheel had been moved aft to the trailing edge and was rubber sprung. Both variants could be winch-launched using a pair of nose hooks connected to Y-ended cables. The rear fuselage of both variants was a light-alloy monocoque, with formers and longerons giving it an elliptical section. Four pins joined it to the forward section. The tail units were also the same on both models. All had light-alloy structures and all fixed surfaces were light-alloy skinned. The control surfaces were fabric-covered. The Ifj√∫s√°g's horizontal tail was trapezoidal in plan as was the fin, though it had a very low forward extension on which the tailplane was mounted. The profile of the broad, unbalanced rudder was also angular and extended down to the keel. The rudder profiles of the two variants were a little different in that the bottom edge of the Z-03As rudder swept up significantly rearwards. The prototype Z-03 was exhibited at the Leipzig Fair in 1955. Operational history The first of 32 production Z-03s first flew in January, 1955. Two of them were exported to Belgium. The glider performed well in distance, speed and height-gain flights and in August 1955 the first pilot went solo in one. However, later that year a serious structural weakness was revealed during an aerobatic flight, when the wing-fuselage connection failed. Fortunately, its two occupants escaped by parachute. Subsequent fatigue tests, concluded in 1960, showed the problem was fatigue failure in the steel fuselage structure after only 275 hours, rather than the joint or the wing. As a result, the Z-03 was withdrawn from service. The Z-03B Ifj√∫s√°g, with its more comfortable, roomier and blind flying equipped cockpit, first flew in May 1956. During a demonstration flight the first example was over-stressed. Minor modifications were made and 32 were built, one of them exported to Austria. Without the flaps of the Z-03A and heavier, the Z-03B was not an easy aircraft for students to land gently. Several were damaged in heavy landings. Like the Z-03As, all Z-04Bs were withdrawn from use in 1960 after the fatigue tests. Variants Z-03A Ifj√∫s√°g ;Z-03: Prototype, first flown February 1953.

It is known for developing carbon finance projects in developing countries that reduce carbon emissions and support the Sustainable Development Goals. CO2balance also provides businesses and individuals with carbon footprint calculation and reduction services, bestowing the label of ‚ÄòCarbonZero‚Äô on those organisations that completely offset the footprint of their operations. CO2balance has two local subsidiaries in Kenya and Uganda, under the titles of CarbonZero Kenya Ltd and CO2balance Uganda Ltd.  History  CO2balance was founded in 2003 by former research chemist Mark Simpson and associated colleagues. Their goal was to create an organisation that worked to mitigate climate change, using the then- novel method of carbon finance. CO2balance started out by developing locally- based carbon finance initiatives in the UK, such as forestry projects in Bishops Wood and Somercombe Wood in Devon, and Sand Martin Wood in Cumbria. As the carbon market developed, the company started to explore the possibility of implementing carbon projects in Africa, as a means to channel revenue from carbon finance into the sustainable development of some of the world‚Äôs poorest communities. In 2007, CO2balance began investing in solar power and improved cookstove projects in East Africa. Soon thereafter the company established two local offices in Kenya and Uganda. In 2008, the company collaborated with 7 other carbon management organisations to found the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance (ICROA), a non-profit organisation that promotes best practice across the voluntary carbon market. By 2012, CO2balance had started to implement energy-efficiency projects under the Gold Standard, VCS and CDM carbon standards, with a particular focus on fuel efficient cookstoves and safe water technology. In 2013 CO2balance registered the first multi- country programme of activities (PoA) for micro-scale projects under the Gold Standard. Since then CO2balance has expanded its scope of activities from East Africa into Southern Africa, West Africa and Southern Asia. In 2017, CO2balance began developing projects for the Gold Standard‚Äôs new Gold Standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG), and became the first organisation to pilot SDG 5 (Gender Equality) for the standard. In November 2018, representatives of CO2balance presented the 2018 .eu Web Award for a Better World to the STARDUST Smart Cities project in Brussels.  Operations  CO2balance operates as both a primary project developer and a consultant for a range of carbon management services for both private and public sector organisations. CO2balance hosting a community meeting in Uganda. = Project development = CO2balance designs and delivers climate protection projects in sub-Saharan Africa, generating marketable carbon credits from the resultant emissions reductions. However, the company is also dedicated to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), so ensures that as well as reducing emissions, the projects also deliver real and demonstrable benefits to target communities. CO2balance adheres to a profit for purpose approach, whereby revenue from the sale of carbon credits is used to maintain projects over the long term and reinvested into new project development. The company typically works in partnership with in-country NGOs to implement their projects. The impacts of projects are verified primarily under the Gold Standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG), as well as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Verra. GS4GG requires projects to demonstrate a clear and direct contribution to at least 3 SDGs, such as gender equality, health, and water/sanitation, to accelerate global progress towards climate security and sustainable development. In 2017, CO2balance became the first organisation to pilot the GS4GG methodology for SDG 5 (Gender Equality). Workers building improved cookstoves as part of a CO2balance clean cooking project in Kenya. CO2balance projects contribute primarily to the following SDGs: * SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing: by reducing exposure to household air pollution and water borne diseases. * SDG 5: Gender Equality: by reducing time-poverty amongst women who disproportionately carry out unpaid domestic duties. * SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation: by providing access to safe water for communities without improved water sources. * SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy: by replacing inefficient traditional cooking methods with improved clean cooking technology. * SDG 13: Climate Action: by reducing the amount of wood burned to cook and purify water, reducing carbon emissions. = Carbon management = CO2balance works with businesses on a range of carbon management services, such as carbon footprinting, energy efficiency assessments, life cycle analyses and carbon offsetting. Footprinting and life cycle assessments typically represent the first step in the carbon management process and are used to identify the key sources of emissions within an organisation‚Äôs operations and any potential areas of savings. Audits are conducted to comply with BSI PAS 2060, ISO 14064 and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard 2011. Footprints may then be negated via the purchase of project- generated carbon credits. CO2balance also conducts carbon and energy auditing for large companies‚Äô Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) assessment reports. CO2balance has worked with organisations such as Toshiba, Canon Medical and Sky. Workers preparing solar panels for a health centre in Uganda, as part of a CO2balance CSR programme. = CarbonZero = CarbonZero is a standard set up by CO2balance. It is provided under license to client organisations for whom a product, service or their entire operations have achieved a net carbon footprint of zero, achieved by purchasing CO2balance carbon credits. Organisations that have been branded CarbonZero include Toshiba, Canon Medical and Hill Dickinson. = Corporate social responsibility (CSR) = CO2balance offers a CSR service to corporate clients, to complement the environmental and social benefits of their climate protection projects. Such CSR projects focus on developing key facilities within rural communities, such as WASH facilities for schools, disease management training, solar systems and renovation of healthcare centres.

He was the first to establish the academic field of Persian language and literature in Italy. Biography From a noble family, at age fifteen Pizzi showed a particular interest in studies of oriental languages and in high school he was encouraged by his Latin and Greek teacher, a Sanskritist, to deepen those studies. For this he went to the University of Pisa, studying among other things Hebrew and other Semitic languages and Sanskrit, as well as Italian literature. Already in Pisa ‚Äì working on the Calcutta edition curated by Turner Macan in 1829 ‚Äì he began to tackle the immense work of the Persian poet Ferdowsi, the Shahnameh, whose bulk of over 100,000 verses makes it longer than the Iliad and the Odyssey put together. An essay of his was published on Rostam and the AkvƒÅn Div, thanks to the active interest of Angelo De Gubernatis.\\"Storia di Rustem e di Akv√¢n\\", Rivista Orientale, Florence, 1868. After graduating in 1871, he began working as a teacher of literature in his native city, without ever abandoning his interest in Orientalism and, more specifically, Iranian languages. He moved to Florence in 1879 and in 1880 he became deputy librarian of the Laurentian Library, earning a lectureship in Iranian studies at the Royal Institute of Higher Studies. On 11 May 1885 he obtained a teaching position at the University of Turin, moving to the Piedmontese capital with his wife, who would bring their only son, Carlo, into the world the following year. In 1887 he became an extraordinary professor of Persian and Sanskrit. Among his pupils at the University of Turin was the young Carlo Alfonso Nallino. During this period, from 1886 to 1888, he published the first (and still the only complete) Italian translation of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh in 8 volumes. He also translated a number of other Persian poets into Italian. He was appointed Director of the Oriental Institute of Naples (the former name of the University of Naples \\"L'Orientale\\"), but remained in Naples for a short time, returning to Turin. Finally he attained the role of full professor on 21 December 1899.  Works  * Storia di Sohrab. Episodio del Shahnameh di Firdusi recato dal persiano in versi italiani.

It was powered by a V6 biturbo engine with a 90 ¬∞ bore of 2975 cm¬≥ of displacement. The biturbo, derived PRV / EIA engine, was capable of delivering 408 hp, with a torque of 530 Nm and acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.1 seconds.i Thanks to St√©phane Ratel, director of competition services for the French company, the Gentlemen Drivers Trophy was created, a championship created specifically to compete with the 400 Trophy (similar to what Porsche had done with Porsche Cup). The principle proposed by Ratel was simple, and was similarly resumed by other manufacturers (for example from Ferrari with FXX): in addition to selling the car, they were sold for little more of 100.00 Fr all the services necessary for participation in the competition. The cars had the same technical preparation, which guaranteed the same chances of winning for all the participants, beyond the financial possibilities of the same. The first edition of the trophy is a success, and the championship includes six races on as many circuits: Le Mans, Pau, Paul Ricard, N√ºrburgring, Magny-Cours and Dijon. In total, the Gentlemen Drivers Trophy lasted for four seasons.  400 GT  From the racing version came the Venturi 400 GT, a road model whose production was definitely much more limited. It was presented by the famous French racing driver Henri Pescarolo in 1994 at the company headquarters, at Cou√´ron. The main differences consisted of a series of small changes aimed at road homologation, while the engine was the same as the race version, with a 5-speed manual gearbox and a top speed of 290 km/h. The passenger compartment, which was obviously of higher quality, was very different, taking up that of the Venturi 260.

Early life and education  Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was born in 1960 in the village of Qandto in the River Nile State in Northern Sudan, to a religious family. al-Burhan studied elementary and intermediate level in his village school, and later moved to Shendi to complete his education before joining the Sudanese Military College among the 31st batch. Military career After graduating from the Military Academy, al-Burhan worked in Khartoum, as part of the Sudanese army, and participated in the fighting fronts in the Darfur war and in the Second Sudanese Civil War in South Sudan and other regions. He later traveled to Egypt and then to Jordan to receive training courses in his military field until in 2018 he was appointed commander of the ground forces of the army. Al-Burhan held several positions throughout his career as he began as a soldier with the Border Guard Forces and later became Commander of this Force before becoming Deputy Chief of Staff of the Ground Forces Operations and then Chief of Staff of the Sudanese Army in February 2018 before he served as Inspector General of the Army for a period of time. By February 26, 2019, during the massive protests that swept the country and demanded the fall of Omar al-Bashir's regime; Abdel al-Fattah al-Burhan was elevated to the Lieutenant General rank. Chairmanship of Military Council Burhan with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2020 Shortly after his appointment, Burhan ordered the release of all jailed prisoners who had been arrested by his predecessor, Omar Al-Bashir, in a televised address. = Khartoum massacre = In early June 2019, following al- Burhan's and Dagalo's visits to the Egyptian, UAE and Saudi leaders, the Sudanese Security Forces and Rapid Support Forces, including Janjaweed militias, led by al-Burhan and his deputy cracked down on peaceful protests in Sudan, starting with the 3 June Khartoum massacre. Dozens of peaceful protesters were killed and about forty of the bodies were thrown in the river Nile, hundreds were tortured, violated and raped in the streets of Khartoum. Al-Burhan's talks with the opposition on forming a combined government were then cancelled. During the days that followed, the TMC arrested several of the opposition leaders. ƒ∞yad el-Baghdadi interpreted the decision-making by the TMC under al-Burhan's leadership as being strongly influenced by the general context of the Saudi, UAE and Egyptian leaders being afraid of democratic movements. Mahmoud Elmutasim, a political activist and doctor who graduated from the University of Khartoum, similarly stated that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are opposed to the existence of democracies in the Middle East, since if \\"the idea of democracy itself [should] ever take root, or become widespread in the Middle East,\\" then it would constitute a threat to the governmental systems of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. = Internet shutdown = Several human rights organizations including Human Rights Watch condemned the Burhan-led TMC for shutting down internet. A spokesperson, Shamseldin Kabbashi, stated that the internet would be shut down for a long time because it represented a threat to national security. The move was described by HRW as a \\"Gross violation of human rights\\". International media saw this as a sign of dictatorship and condemned the act. Many believe it was an attempt to hide what Al Burhan's allied militia known as the Janjaweed were doing in Khartoum and to delay uploading evidence of the violations that took place on the 3 June 2019 and the days that followed. =Civilian government negotiations= Numerous protesters asked for a civilian government. On Saturday 13 April 2019, Burhan announced that a civilian government would soon be established. Burhan promised that the transitional period would take a maximum of two years. Negotiations started to take place with the opposition leaders to achieve this. In late May 2019, al-Burhan visited the Egyptian president el- Sisi and the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. ƒ∞yad el-Baghdadi, a human rights activist who became famous during the Arab Spring, later interpreted these visits (together with a visit by TMC deputy leader Dagalo to Mohammad bin Salman in Saudi Arabia) as encouragements for the TMC to cancel negotiations with the opposition.

Part is a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds nature reserve. The estuary has large areas of salt marsh. Sea purslane is dominant above the mean high water mark and glasswort below. There are also intertidal mudflats which are nationally important for ringed plovers and other wading birds include redshanks and dunlin. There is no public access to the RSPB reserve. History The Adur Estuary has been an active feature, influenced by the deposition of sediment by the river, the longshore drift of shingle and the efforts of humans to maintain a port. Originally the port was located at Old Shoreham which is now off the current coast and the Adur could be navigated as far as Bramber. In the eleventh century, the river had silted so much that the port was moved downstream to the modern town of Shoreham, then known as New Shoreham. When the coast was surveyed in 1587 in preparation for defence against the Spanish Armada the course of the river flowed east from New Shoreham to enter the English Channel between New Shoreham and Kingston-by-Sea. To the west of the mouth there was a shingle beach which was wide at New Shoreham and which tapered away as it approached Lancing. By 1648, records indicate that there had been a noticeable extension of the spit at Shoreham of and the total length of the spit was . A 1698 record shows that it had extended a further and that many bars had formed within the river. As Shoreham beach grew eastwards it thinned to less than by 1698 and the lagoons opposite New Shoreham had silted up and become marshland. A number of artificial cuts were made in the late 17th and 18th centuries but these all silted up. By 1757, the Adur entered the sea at Aldrington, and in 1760 the decision was taken to create an artificial cut at Kingston to improve access to the port and upstream drainage upstream. The new cut resulted in increased tidal floes which overwhelmed the saltmarshes on the north bank. A map of 1778‚Äì1783 showed that there was a belt of marsh which was protected by the shingle bar to the east of the exit, then wider than the present bar. Deposition of sediment meant the entrance to the port continued to drift and in 1818 the original 1760 cut was re-excavated and groynes and breakwaters were built to protect it. In 1821 the cut was made a permanent opening by the building of walls while in 1860 the old channel east of Kingston was canalised to become a basin where water levels were controlled by locks. The estuary appears to have been stabilised from 1816, however, the mud and sand banks within the estuary have shifted. The western arm of the shingle bar has gained sufficient material for housing development to be permitted. The eastern arm has seen the amount of shingle slowly decrease and this has caused concern about the safety and stability of the former power station at Shoreham. Wildlife The intertidal flats of the Adur Estuary and the saltmarsh are important for feeding and roosting birds. Eurasian teal and mallard are the commonest wildfowl species while waders include Northern lapwing, grey plover, common redshank, common snipe and ruddy turnstone. The estuary is most important as a wintering site for common ringed plover and the numbers here regularly attain a level representing 1% of the total British population of this species. A reedbed next to the estuary, on the northern side of the A27, holds breeding populations of common moorhen, Eurasian reed warbler and sedge warbler. The embankment close to the car park is home a large colony of viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara).

The blast destroyed several buildings and damaged dozens of others, killing two people and injuring 25 others, including 9 firefighters. City officials have cited a gas leak to be the cause of the blast. On June 22nd, 2020, four separate lawsuits were filed in relation to the explosion. Each lawsuit represented separate victims of the blast, including one of the two deceased. Background The explosion occurred at a local coffee shop by the name of Kaffeinate. The store was run by shop owner Kong Lee and his family. At 9:38am, firefighters responded to a call of a potential gas leak near the Kaffeinate shop. Many witnesses reported the smell of gas prior to the explosion taking place. Durham officials stated that they evacuated eight to ten people from the coffee shop prior to the blast. The leak was reportedly caused by a gas line being breached by contractors with valid work permits. Explosion At 10:07am, an explosion was reported near downtown Durham. The damage was widespread, as businesses roughly two blocks away suffered damage although this was mostly limited to shattered windows. Fifteen buildings suffered damage in and around Brightleaf. The coffee shop, Kaffeinate, was reduced to rubble as a result of the blast. An adjacent building holding a Porsche collection was destroyed. An office building directly in front of the coffee shop suffered extensive damage to its interior and exterior. The explosion could be felt several miles away, and a large smoke cloud from the resulting fire could be seen from miles away ‚Äî this smoke cloud also showed up on weather radar. The Durham School of the Arts suffered damage to its interior, although no injuries were reported. =Casualties= 25 people were treated for injuries and at least 10 people were sent to local hospitals. Duke Regional Hospital and Duke University Hospital each received 5 patients. Kong Lee, the owner of Kaffeinate, was killed in the blast while preparing to evacuate the store. Jay Rambeaut, a Dominion Energy first responder, was sent to UNC Medical Center, where he died from his injuries on April 25. Five of the injured were in critical condition. Nine of the 25 injured were responding firefighters. One firefighter suffered major injuries and underwent surgery. Vincent E. Price, the president of Duke University, confirmed that 10 Duke employees were injured in the explosion. Aftermath Passersby rushed to the scene quickly after the explosion, seeking to help the injured, while others helped motorists who were trapped in their cars by inflated airbags. City firefighters soon began arriving to fight a fire triggered by the explosion. Once the blaze was extinguished, a search-and-rescue effort began; it continued until the evening of the following day. Following an investigation, officials in the Durham Fire Department released a reporthttps://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2019/08/09/18560197/8.8.19_N_Duke_Street_Gas_Explosion_Report_Appendices- DMID1-5jr9s37is.pdf which determined that a three person crew from Optic Cable Technology digging horizontally to install underground cables breached a 3/4 inch gas line in front of Kaffeinate on the morning of the explosion. Shop owner Kong Lee went outside to complain about the gas smell ‚Äì the report includes images from a nearby security camera that shows Lee waving his hand in front of his nose as he talked with the crew ‚Äì but there was no evidence that Lee or anyone from Optic Cable called 911 to report the gas leak.

The film is an examination of the global textile industry. Production Production for The Grand Bizarre began in 2013 as Mack was touring internationally with a program titled Let Your Light Shine. She had previously made multiple films showing patterned textiles, and during a stop in Oaxaca, Mexico, she shot footage of fabrics owned by a man from a weaving village. After Mexico, she proceeded to film in China and Poland. She stopped touring her earlier films so that she could travel for production of The Grand Bizarre. Observing the omnipresence of international brands, she began focusing on the influence of commerce on art, the impact of tourism on regional economies, and the ethics of ethnography. Over course of five years, Mack collected footage in fifteen countries, including Turkey, Greece, Israel, Morocco, and Indonesia. Mack shot The Grand Bizarre on 16 mm film using a Bolex camera. As a result, the maximum length she was able to use for a shot was 30 seconds. Post-production Mack edited the film from a total of six hours of footage. She decided to make it an hour long because that was the most that she could fit on a 16 mm reel. She also thought it was fitting to match the film's duration to a unit of time. She received support through a fellowship with the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. This allowed her to spend more time on the project during the final year of making The Grand Bizarre. The Grand Bizarre uses twelve songs, ten of which are by Mack. In recording the music, Mack focused on exploring tropes in pop and electronic music, such as Auto-Tune and repeated phrases in 4/4 time. She was interested in looking at the connection between mass production and homogenous music. An earlier cut of the film used more vocal performance, which she removed to simplify the experience. To avoid having the songs overpower the visuals, Mack often played the songs where she was shooting and re-recorded them. This introduced diegetic sounds from the locations into the film. Release Filmmaker Jodie Mack presenting The Grand Bizarre at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival The film premiered August 3, 2018 at the Locarno Festival. Reception The Grand Bizarre received positive reviews from film critics. In a review for Film Threat, Nick Rocco Scalia called it an \\"extremely eye-opening\\" film that forces the audience \\"to consider how complicated and incredible every single stitch of a rug, or a scarf, or a dishtowel actually is, and how easily it is to overlook that fact.\\" For NOW Toronto, Kevin Ritchie said that \\"the film bursts with energy and invention to the point of sensory overload.\\" Film Comment magazine ranked The Grand Bizarre eighth on its \\"Best Undistributed Films of 2018\\" list.

She has been Regional Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM; now part of UN Women) for the Andean Region (2002‚Äì2004) and for Brazil and the Southern Cone Countries (2004‚Äì2009). She is a researcher and Professor at the National University of C√≥rdoba (UNC), where she is the Director of the Housing and Habitat Research Institute (INVIHAB). In the field of feminist action, she promoted numerous institutional initiatives and contributed to the establishment of women's rights to the city, to housing, and to the habitat. She is co-founder of the Women and Habitat Network of Latin America, of the Centro de Intercambio y Servicios para el Cono Sur Argentina (CISCSA), of UNC's Interdisciplinary Program of Women's and Gender Studies (PIEMG), and of Articulaci√≥n Feminista Marcosur, among other areas of action in favor of women's rights. In 2013 she won the Feminist Career Award together with other Argentine women. Early years Ana Fal√∫ was born in San Miguel de Tucum√°n in 1947, the granddaughter of Syrian immigrants. She is the sister of singer Juan Fal√∫, disappeared student activist , and lawyer and politician Dr. Jose Ricardo Fal√∫. She studied architecture at the National University of Tucum√°n's Faculty of Architecture and graduated a few months before the 1976 coup d'√©tat. This event marked her life, as she had to leave the country, along with her husband and two children, traveling first to Brazil and then, because of Operation Condor, to the Netherlands. Fal√∫ became involved in politics as a student, through groups interested in the living conditions of the poorest sectors of the population, visiting towns and neighborhoods without conditions of habitability. This helped her to start work on social housing and habitat conditions. In her final year's project she developed some houses for a sugar cooperative in which she also proposed using low-cost technologies such as cane bagasse as a material to make prefabricated panels. Career In the Netherlands, Fal√∫ completed a Diploma in Social Housing at the TU Delft Faculty of Architecture's Department of International Studies. She continued to study precarious and informal settlements, focusing on issues related to land tenure, services and infrastructures. Her thesis was titled Low Income Housing and Infrastructure. At TU Delft, she worked as a teacher in a section of the Architecture faculty called the \\"Third World\\". At this institution she would complete her doctoral thesis on social housing in the Netherlands. In the early 1980s she moved to Ecuador on a Dutch international cooperation technical assignment. The combination of different experiences made her start working with the relationship between woman and habitat. The cooperation assignment comprised the construction of residential villas in the Ecuadorian Amazon basin for the families of oil workers. This work was done jointly with Fernando Chaves and Carlos R√≠os, who managed the construction system with wood from the area, and she was in charge of managing the project. Fal√∫'s years in Ecuador were marked by intense feminist activism. She connected with the feminist movement in the country, with those who went to the first meetings of feminist women in Latin America and the Caribbean. Since then her activism has crossed into all aspects of her professional and personal life. The implications of feminism gave rise to other issues, and she met with Mar√≠a Arboleda in a study group to construct a conceptual theoretical framework of women and habitat. Over years they worked to implement policies for a city without violence against women. Working with the United Nations, she met with governments and especially women's organizations throughout Latin America, which led her to being invited to direct the UNIFEM Andean Region, a post she held from 2002 to 2004, and for Brazil and the Southern Cone Countries from 2004 to 2009. Her position at the UN allowed her to establish more than 10 programs in the region, one of the most important being Safe Cities for Women, Safe Cities for All. This was a pioneering effort which served to inspire other global programs. In 2009 she returned to C√≥rdoba to do research and work at UNC, where she teaches and directs the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism's Housing and Habitat Research Institute. Fal√∫ has maintained her connection with the United Nations, and she is currently the coordinator of UN-Habitat's gender advisory group.

The Grimshaws are one of the most well-documented enslaved families who lived at Mount Airy. Though the Grimshaws were a well-regarded slave family at Mount Airy, it wasn‚Äôt enough to keep their master from dissolving her family ties.  Family and childhood  Portrait of William Henry Tayloe by Charles Bird King Her parents were Esther Jackson and Bill Grimshaw, enslaved by William Henry Tayloe. Both were valuable to Mount Airy, as Esther was a spinner, and Bill served as Tayloe‚Äôs head carpenter from 1832 to 1845. Bill worked on the Octagon in Washington D.C., the Tayloe‚Äôs winter residence and later the temporary home of President Madison and his family for six months after the British burned the White House. Mount Airy did not keep birth records, but Winney Grimshaw is listed on the inventory for the Old House on January 1, 1827, recorded as being one year old. Esther and Bill had seven children, Lizza (1824), Winney (1826), Anna (1827), Juliet (1829), James (1831), Charlotte (1834), and Henry (1837). In 1830, at four years old, Grimshaw was sent to Washington D.C. to live with her grandmother and namesake, Winney Jackson, who worked as Anne Tayloe‚Äôs chambermaid. At age five, she returned to Mount Airy lived with her mother in the Old House, and her father lived a few miles away at the home quarter of Mount Airy. Grimshaw did not have an assigned job until 1839, when she was thirteen years old. Most enslaved children had been working for a few years by this age. Due to Esther‚Äôs role as a spinner, she was often in close proximity to the household where Grimshaw spent much of her childhood. In 1840, at fourteen, Grimshaw was sent out to her first job accompanied by her sisters - Anna, twelve years old, and Juliet, ten years old. They were lent to Mrs. William N. Ward, the wife of a local clergyman. She was expected to feed, clothe, and house the girls. This was an easy way for masters to train young enslaved girls for the life of domestic service. Around 1841 or 1842, Winney returned to Mount Airy, living for the first time without the company of her family. She lived on a farming quarter with forty other slaves, though her job was to tend to Mrs. Monday, the sickly wife of her white master. A year later in 1843, at seventeen years old, Winney Grimshaw was documented as a spinner, and in 1844 she married Jacob Carrington who had worked in the plantation‚Äôs gristmill since the age of nine. Jacob Carrington‚Äôs father was unusual in that he was an emancipated African American, though this did not benefit Jacob as the law of partus sequitur ventrem ruled that the title of slavery was passed down maternally. Together Winney and Jacob lived in the home quarter, and in 1844 at eighteen years old, Grimshaw gave birth to her first son, John Carrington.  Separation  In 1845, Bill Grimshaw ran away after being whipped as punishment for a disagreement with one of his white supervisors. He was the only Mount Airy slave to run away permanently in the years between 1808 and 1860. As punishment and to discourage other runways, Tayloe broke up the Grimshaw family. Letters between Juliet and her older sister Lizza display the distress felt at the separation of their family. At nineteen Grimshaw, her fourteen-year-old brother James, and her baby John, were all sent to the Oakland cotton plantation in Alabama. Virginia became a large exporter of slave labor in the U.S. after the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves took effect in 1808. William Henry Tayloe sent a total of 218 Mount Airy slaves to Alabama between 1833 and 1862. Winney was a trained spinner and James was training as a carpenter so their usefulness on a cotton plantation was minimal, but their transfer was an example for other Mount Airy slaves. Plantation labor was much more difficult than domestic labor which was seen as a more favorable position. It is unknown the exact cause, but in 1847 during her time at the plantation Grimshaw‚Äôs son, John Carrington, died.  Life in Alabama  During this time in Grimshaw's life, she was faced with the exploitation of her white masters that many enslaved women endured throughout the Atlantic World before abolition. (See for example the biographies of Alice Clifton, Jane the Runaway, Bridge Town, and Betty, George and Martha Washington's enslaved seamstress.) Scholars have found that many enslaved women's most intimate lives were closely managed and dictated by their owners. With her husband remaining at Mount Airy, In 1849, Winney Grimshaw bore her supervisor Richard Donnahan‚Äôs son, naming him John after her late infant. Grimshaw is documented as his black mistress throughout his family correspondence. In 1850, a second child was born, Julia, who died as young baby. In 1853 Grimshaw gave birth to another baby girl Lizza. Both babies shared namesakes with their aunts, Winney‚Äôs sisters Juliet and Lizza, which demonstrates the importance of family ties even after being transferred to the plantation. After the birth of Lizza, William Henry Tayloe attempted to break up the relationship between Grimshaw and Donnahan by first encouraging Donnahan to manage a different plantation that was miles away. When this did not work, Tayloe focused on Grimshaw instead, giving her four-year-old son John as a New Years gift to his niece, Lucy Tayloe, who documented the exchange with a thank you letter. This did not end the relationship between Donnahan and Grimshaw, and in 1855 Willie Anne was born, followed by William Henry. Because Tayloe owned the reproductive rights of his slaves, any of Grimshaw's children would become his property. It was unusual that Tayloe disapproved of her children with Donnahan, as increasing slave ownership would increase prosperity. The remainder of Grimshaw's children stayed with her, and in 1858 Tayloe dismissed Donnahan, separating the white supervisor from his slave. In 1861, Grimshaw was documented as a housekeeper on the Larkin plantation for her overseer John W. Ramey. In 1862, Grimshaw gave birth to another baby, Thorton, fathered by Ramey. This created tensions between Mrs. Ramey and her husband, as well as Ramey and Tayloe. In November 1865 Grimshaw is listed again at the Larkin plantation with five children, suggesting that she had given birth to yet another baby. Shortly after the beginning of the Civil War, Tayloe moved many of his enslaved workers on Mount Airy to Alabama. Many families that had been separated were given the chance to reunite, however, Grimshaw's husband, Jacob Carrington, had determined that freedom was more important than returning to his wife. He left Mount Airy in December 1861; Richard Dunn claims that he \\"deserted to the Yankee army\\" when he found out about Tayloe's plan to move. Carrington's decision demonstrates the difficult choice that many enslaved women and men had to make between family and freedom, like that of Winney's father Bill.  Later years  Though the Grimshaw family is considered to be well-documented, other than the mention of the births of Winney Grimshaw's children her documentation is sparse. She is listed as a domestic worker at the Oakland plantation between the ages of 19 and 28, then at the Woodlawn plantation between ages 29 and 32, and at Larkin plantation from ages 33 to 40. All three plantations were located in Alabama and were owned by William Henry Tayloe. Winney Grimshaw's name appears for the last time at the Larkin plantation in 1866. Tayloe, reflecting on his time as a slaveholder, mentions Winney's name for the last time in 1868 saying, \\"Winney Grimshaw could fill a volume with interesting events, if [she] could write.\\" Neither Grimshaw nor any of her children are listed on the 1870 US census.

From left to right: a dancer, then a man and a woman with cymbals, then a lute-player, and finally two dancers with cymbals in their hands. Hittite music is the music of the Hittites of the 17th-12th century BC and of the Syro-Hittite successor states of the 12th-7th century BC. Understanding of Hittite music is based on archaeological finds and literary source material. Hittite texts mainly describe the use of music in religious contexts. The basic musical elements were instrumental music and singing, as well as shouting and other noises, like clapping. Because of the small amount of evidence, Hittite music is poorly understood compared to Mesopotamian and Egyptian music of the same period.  Cultural and chronological variation  The inhabitants of the Hittite empire did not belong to a single ethnicity. The north, up to the Black Sea, was inhabited by the Hatti, which had a large influence on Hittite culture. Their language, Hattian, was regularly used in Hittite religious rituals. The Luwians, who were closely related to the Hittites, lived in southern Anatolia, and it seems that the horn played a particularly important role in their religious rituals. Several song introductions in the Luwian language are transmitted in Hittite texts. Influence from the Hurrians who lived to the east of the Hittites only came relatively late. In the later period of the Hittite empire, they had a great influence on the Hittite mythology. The oldest complete piece of musical notation is a Hurrian hymn from Ugarit.Anne Draffkorn Kilmer: \\"The Cult Song with Music from Ancient Ugarit: Another Interpretation.\\" Revue d‚ÄôAssyriologique. Vol. 68, 1974, pp. 69‚Äì82, at p. 69. Hittite musical history can be divided into three periods. The oldest evidence from Anatolia is archaeological finds of noise-makers which are classified as pre-Hittite. The best understood period is the music of the Hittite empire. After the fall of the empire around 1180 BC, there were several small Syro-Hittite principalities in southeastern Anatolia and Syria. The Luwian texts from this period provide no information about music, but several sculpted relief scenes contain detailed depictions of musicians, alongside various other scenes of daily life. With the final conquest of these states by the Assyrians in the 7th century BC, evidence for Hittite culture and thus Hittite music disappears.  Evidence  , (17-16th century BC), with various ritual and musical scenes. In the bottom frieze, a man plays a large lyre, and another musician to the right plays a smaller one. In addition, lute-players, women with cymbals, and dancers performing somersaults are shown. The textual evidence for Hittite music comes mainly from Bronze Age archives of the Hittite capital Hattusa. These texts in Hittite cuneiform deal mainly with music for religious contexts. The texts provide detailed information on when singing, recitation, or dancing should occur in a ritual, which musical instruments should be used and who should play them, as well as when no music should be played. Unlike Mesopotamia and Egypt, there are no known texts on music theory. The little archaeological evidence that there is consists largely of depictions on ritual vessels and on stone reliefs. Musical instruments or their components are rarely recovered, in comparison with the situation in Mesopotamia and Egypt.

Image and sistrums have been recovered from pre-Hittite times. Cult vases from the early Hittite period, such as the , the , and the H√ºseyindede vases have depictions of people playing music, often accompanied by acrobats and sacrifices. From the late Hittite period there are several stone reliefs with musical groups, often accompanied by jugglers, such as those from Carchemish, Kahramanmara≈ü, Sam'al, and Karatepe. They show Mesopotamian influences. At Karatepe, Greek elements have also been detected. An 8th century orthostat from that site is the oldest known depiction of an aulos player with a ().Schuol, Hethitische Kultmusik, p. 131  Instruments  Hittitetexts mention many musical instruments, not all of which can be certainly identified. A problem for understanding the Hittite names for musical instruments lies in the fact that no bilingual texts or word lists which deal with music are known to us. Even many of the Akkadian terms for musical instruments are not yet entirely certainly understood. Names of Hittite musical instruments may be transmitted to us in Hittite, Luwian or Hattian languages. Yet others are recorded in Sumerograms, so their actual Hittite names are not known to us. For understanding how instruments it can be helpful to know whether an instrument was blown (Hitt. paripariya-), plucked (Hitt. ·∏´azzikk- or ·∏´azzi≈°k-), or drummed (Hitt. wal·∏´-) - the last two terms were used for noisemakers, percussion instruments, and string instruments; the first term only for wind instruments.de Martino. \\"Musik. Bei den Hethitern,\\" RdA, p. 484. Rarely there is other information on the construction of the instrument which can enable a clearer identification. A final method of identifying named instruments is the relative frequency of references to the instrument in texts and imagery. = Lyre = The lyre (Hittite: zinar; Summerogram: GI≈†.dINANNA 'Ishtar- Instrument' after the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar) is the best attested musical instrument. The textual and archaeological evidence distinguishes between small and large lyres. The two kinds of lyre could be played one after the other, but probably never at the same time. Lyres were played by musicians and cult-singers - in texts, the only named lyre players are women. The large standing lyre (Hittite: ·∏´unzinar; Sumerogramm: GI≈†.dINANNA.GAL 'large Ishtar instrument') was about two metres high and is shown in art as being played by two men simultaneously.Rainer Michael Boehmer: \\"Von zwei Musikanten gespielte Leiern.\\" in Heinrich Otten et al. (ed.): Hittite and other Anatolian and Near Eastern Studies in Honour of Sedat Alp. Sedat Alp‚Äôa armaƒüan. T√ºrk Tarih Kurumu Basƒ±mevi, Ankara 1992, pp. 67 f. The number of strings is not certain. They often appear in cult texts, usually accompanied by singing or played along with a drum or other instruments. It is possible that the sound box was also used as a percussion instrument. The small lyre (Hittite: ippizinar; Sumerogramm: GI≈†.dINANNA.TUR 'small Ishtar-instrument) had around ten strings and was played during drinking ceremonies by cult-singers, usually on its own, without any accompaniment. It was seldom held or played by a man. Like other cult and temple equipment, lyres could be worshipped as divine. Sacred lyres were anointed and given offerings of drink and food. Since some texts refer to the \\"sweet news of the lyre\\", it is possible that the lyre was considered to be an intermediary between the offerers of a sacrifice and the deity receiving the offering. The oldest depictions of lyres in Anatolia and North Syria come from the first half of the third millennium BC (, Carchemesh, Urkesh). There are images from the second millennium BC from K√ºltepe, Tarsus, and Mardin.√Öke Norborg: Ancient Middle East Lyres (= Musikmuseets Skrifter. Volume 25). Musikmuseet, Stockholm 1995. All of these early depictions come from cylinder seals, whose small size means that few details can be made out beyond their five or six strings. Small lyre on the ƒ∞nandiƒ±k vase Lyres on the Boston Fist The lyres on the ƒ∞nandƒ±k vase are asymmetrical. They have a square sound box and two arms shaped like a swan's neck which terminate in the heads of an unidentifiable animal. The cross-bar is attached to the arms and itself terminates in animal heads at both ends. The seven strings were fastened to the sound box with a tailpiece. It is not clear how the strings were tuned. The Boston Fist, a Hittite drinking vessel in the shape of a fist, with a depiction of an offering scene for the weather god has two asymmetrical box lyres, which are not decorated. Bird and animal head decoration are also found on lyres from the Aegean, like the lyre-players in the Mycenaean palace at Pylos and in Ancient Egypt, where the lyre first appeared around 2000 BC.Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, pp. 57f., 104f; Hans Hickmann: √Ñgypten (= Musikgeschichte in Bildern. Series 2, Volume 1). Deutscher Verlag f√ºr Musik, Leipzig 1961. In Mesopotamia, on the other hand, the sound boxes of lyres were often depicted as reclining bulls or with the protome of a bull.Schuol, Hethitische Kultmusik, pp. 104f. In Late Hittite reliefs, only hand lyres are depicted, which take various forms and are different from the Old Hittite lyres. At Karatepe there is a depiction of a lyre which bears a striking resemblance to the ancient Greek phorminx.Schuol, Hethitische Kultmusik, p. 73 = Lute = Lute player from Alaca H√∂y√ºk The Long-necked lute (Sumerogram: GI≈†TIBULA \\\\- the traditional Hittological transcription of the Akkadian tigidl√ªMiguel Civil, \\"The Tigidlu Bird and a Musical Instrument.\\" Nouvelles assyriologiques br√®ves et utilitaires (NABU). 1987, p. 27.) is also well- attested and could be played alone or accompanied by singing or dancing. In Hittite rituals, the lute played an important role along with the lyre, which was very much unlike the situation in Mesopotamia and Egypt, where the lute only appeared at the beginning of the 18th dynasty.Schuol, Hethitische Kultmusik, p. 110 The meaning of the Akkadian word tigidl√ª used to be unknown, but it was revealed by a word list from Emar that there was a three-stringed tigidl√ª instrument, which suggests a lute, and the reference to a \\"traveling tigidl√ª\\" in this list fits well with a lute.Theo Krispijn: \\"Musical ensembles in Ancient Mesopotamia.\\" in Richard Dumbrill, Irving Finkel (ed.): Proceedings of the International Conference of Near Eastern Archaeomusicology Held at the British Museum, December 4, 5 and 6, 2008. ICONEA Publications, London 2010, pp. 135‚Äì150 (PDF). Based on artistic depictions, the Hittites used lutes with relatively small sound boxes and long fingerboards, which resemble the Pandura later used by the Greeks and Romans. Lutes were also known in Mesopotamia and Egypt. There, a pumpkin or other gourd was covered with a resonance board, with a long rod which served as the fingerboard. This fingerboard might be fretted and have two or three strings. The earliest depiction of a long-necked lute in Anatolia is on a cup from Samsat (Layer XIII, 17th century BC), which shows a man with a particularly broad triangular torso, holding a long-necked lute with a round soundbox. No details can be discerned.Nimet √ñzg√º√ß: \\"A Lute Player of Samsat.\\" In Heinrich Otten u. a. (Hrsg.): Hittite and other Anatolian and Near Eastern studies in honour of Sedat Alp. Sedat Alp‚Äôa armaƒüan. T√ºrk Tarih Kurumu Basƒ±mevi, Ankara 1992, pp. 419‚Äì423; Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, p. 110. In Hittite depictions, the lutist hold the relatively small soundbox in the curve of their right elbow. The strings were strummed with the right hand or with a plectrum that was tied to the instrument with a string. The fretted fingerboard was held up with the left hand. The number of strings is not absolutely clear, but may have been either two or three. The lutes in artistic depictions are built in a number of different ways. The clearly recognisable lutes on the ƒ∞nandƒ±k vase have an oval soundbox with six sound holes. The lute on the Sphinx Gate at Alaca H√∂y√ºk on the other hand has an octagonal soundbox with ten small sound holes, which is often referred to in general works as the earliest image of a guitar. While the strings with which the strings were tied to the head of the fingerboard were often left hanging loose in the Bronze Age, in Late Hittite times, they were tied to long cords which hung down and were tied to a knot underneath, as was also the case in contemporary Mesopotamian lutes. = Harps = The Harp has not been identified in literary sources. Artistic depictions which might depict a harp, are very rare and only survive in fragmentary form. This starkly contrasts with the situation in Mesopotamia, where harps were the most important instrument, especially in ritual.de Martino: Musik. Bei den Hethitern, RdA, p. 485. = Horn = The Horn (Hittite ≈°awetra, Luwian ≈°awatar) was shaped like a bull's horn, according to a Late Hittite relief from Carchemesh (9th century BC). The same word was also used for a drinking horn, but never for the horn of an actual animal. It was particularly used in Luwian rituals and could be played by a bugler or a drummer. In the cult of I≈°tanuwa, the same horn was used as a libation vessel and as a musical instrument. Due to its limited tonal range, it was used mainly to give signals rather than play melodies. = Woodwind instrument = Woodwind instruments (Sumerogram: GI.G√çD \\"long tube\\") are also mentioned in Hittite texts. Since there are no Bronze Age depictions of woodwinds, it is not clear whether this instrument was a reed instrument or a flute. Monika Schuol considers a 'double oboe' most likely for musicological reasons.Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, pp. 129‚Äì131 The woodwind instrument was particularly associated with thecult of the mountain god ·∏™ulla, which was part of the originally Hattian cult of the town of Arinna. The woodwind could be accompanied by singing and the player might double as a singer. In Late Hittite reliefs, many musicians are depicted with a double wind instrument which looks a bit like a Greek aulos. A striking example is the musician at Karatepe, who wears a mouth band (8th century BC).Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, pp. 73, 131 A poorly preserved relief from Gaziantep (8th century BC) appears to depict a syrinx player.Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, p. 76 = Drum = Group of musicians from Karatepe (9th century BC): two men playing the frame drum and two lyre-players Drums (Hittite arkammi-; Sumerogram: GI≈†BALAG.DI) were often used at the beginnings of musical pieces and to accompany dancing, where different kinds of drum were apparently not distinguished. They were played by both male and female musicians, who would also sing or blow the horn as required. A Late Hittite relief from Carchemesh (9th century BC) shows a drum with a diameter of about a meter, carried and played by two men with shoulder-straps, while a third man whose role is not clear stands behind the drum. Reliefs from Zincirli (8th century BC) show men holding frame drums in their left hands and beating them with their right hands.Schuol, Hethitische Kultmusik, p. 71 = Cymbals = Cymbals are first attested archaeologically in the early Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC) at Alaca H√∂y√ºk, Horoztepe and other locations.Werner Bachmann: Fr√ºhbronzezeitliche Musikinstrumente Anatoliens. In: Ellen Hickmann et al. (ed.): Musikarch√§ologie fr√ºher Metallzeiten. Vortr√§ge des 1. Symposiums der International Study Group on Music Archaeology im Kloster Michaelstein, 18.‚Äì24 Mai 1998 (= Studien zur Musikarch√§ologie. Band 2). Verlag Marie Leidorf, Rahden/Westf. 2000, pp. 145‚Äì177. Cymbals have also been found at karum-period K√ºltepe (18th century BC). A pair of cymbals with a diameter of 8.5 cm was found in the wreckage of the Uluburun shipwreck (14th century BC).George F. Bass: \\"A Bronze Age Shipwreck at Ulu Burun (Ka≈ü): 1984 Campaign.\\" American Journal of Archaeology. vol. 90, 1986, pp. 269‚Äì296, at p. 288f, with image (doi:10.2307/505687). In artistic depictions, cymbals are often hard to distinguish from frame drums. A Hittite offering vessel in the shape of a fist (the 'Boston fist') shows an offering ceremony for the Weather god, in which a musician plays a pair of cymbals which are tied together with a string. Generally cymbals are depicted being played by women, generally in pairs, and often accompanied by acrobats or other musicians. The GI≈†·∏´u·∏´upal instrument could be beaten and struck, and also served as a libation vessel in offering rituals, which makes an identification difficult, but it may have been a cymbal.de Martino: Musik. Bei den Hethitern, RdA, p. 484. The ·∏´u·∏´upal could be played alongside the lyre. In the city of I≈°tanuwa, the Luwian dancing god Tarwaliya was honoured with the ·∏´u·∏´upal. An account of a ritual from this city includes the use of the ·∏´u·∏´upal for libations of wine. The URUDUgalgalturi instrument was made from metal, wood, or clay and was played as part of a pair, so it was probably also a cymbal.Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, pp. 124‚Äì128de Martino: Musik. Bei den Hethitern, RdA, p. 486. ·∏´u·∏´upal and galgalturi instruments were often played along with arkammi drums. These three instruments were closely associated with the goddess ≈†au≈°ka. In the Hurrian myth of ·∏™edammu, ≈†au≈°ka and her servants Ninatta and Kulitta bewitch the sea- dragon ·∏™edammu by playing the arkammi, ·∏´u·∏´upal, and galgaturi instruments. The Night Goddess of Samuha, a form of ≈†au≈°ka, received a pair of bronze cymbals, a pair of boxwood or ivory ·∏´u·∏´upal instruments, and a drum, as an offering. = Other percussion instruments = Pre-Hittite sistrum from Horoztepe, 3rd millennium BC. Sistrums are archaeologically attested from the early Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC). They consist of a U or V-shaped frame with three crossbars, which each hold two metal plates. There are two well-preserved sistrums from Horoztepe, which are decorated with birds, cattle, deer, and other animals.Werner Bachmann: \\"Fr√ºhbronzezeitliche Musikinstrumente Anatoliens.\\" In Ellen Hickmann et al. (ed.): Musikarch√§ologie fr√ºher Metallzeiten. Vortr√§ge des 1. Symposiums der International Study Group on Music Archaeology im Kloster Michaelstein, 18.‚Äì24 Mai 1998 (= Studien zur Musikarch√§ologie. Band 2). Verlag Marie Leidorf, Rahden/Westf. 2000, pp. 145‚Äì177. A late Hittite relief from Karkemesh shows a young man holding a kind of rattle or claves in his hand. There was also an instrument called the GI≈†mukar, which may have been a sistrum, rattle, or some other percussion instrument.Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, p. 120 A textual reference seems to indicate that it consisted of several rods. The mukar was alsoemployed in protective and apotropaic magic. In the Hattian cult of Nerik, the Weather god of Nerik was invoked using a mukar. The instrument was also used by the \\"man of the Weather god of Zippalanda\\".Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, pp. 120‚Äì122 = Spears = A unique feature of Hittite music was the men of the Hattian city of Anunuwa. These men participated in special events, including the in Hattusa, at which they beat their spears (Hitt. marit) rhythmically against one another and sang songs in the Hittite language. At another event, the men of Anunuwa beat their lances rhythmically in time to a lyre played by the 'Man of the Protective god'.Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, pp. 122‚Äì124 = Clapping= The meaning of the Hittite verb palwai- and the personal describtion palwatalla is uncertain. Either \\"clapper\\" or \\"reciter / psalmist\\" are possible based on the general context, and a combination of clapping and recitation is also conceivable.Schuol: Hethitische Kultmusik, pp. 172‚Äì174Johann Tischler: Hethitisches Handw√∂rterbuch (= Innsbrucker Beitr√§ge zur Sprachwissenschaft.

Band 64). Carl, N√ºrnberg 1979, pp. 369‚Äì372. Since other words for 'speaking', 'calling' and 'reciting' are known in Hittite, it has also been proposed that the word means 'rhythmic speech', which might be a hint at a kind of ritual Sprechgesang.

He rose to the rank of admiral and was commander of the Pacific Fleet. Born into the family of a Cossack ataman, Panteleyev and his father both were keen yachtsmen, living in Saint Petersburg. With the Russian Revolution in 1917 Panteleyev volunteered with a group of sailors of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Navy, and was soon given his own commands. He took part in the defence of Petrograd during the Russian Civil War, and in the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921. Undertaking further studies and naval courses, Panteleyev specialised in navigation and served on a number of ships of the Black Sea Fleet, and then as a staff officer of the Northern Military Flotilla. After command of submarine brigades in the Black Sea, Panteleyev was appointed chief of staff of the Baltic Fleet, in anticipation of future hostilities. He served during the Soviet-Finnish War, and after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, was tasked with the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn and then took charge of the naval defence of Leningrad. Success in this area was followed with an appointment to take charge of the and establish a safe supply of fuel for the armies operating in the region. Having achieved this, he then was appointed commander of the , with the important task of defending and keeping open the approaches to the Northern ports. He successfully arranged the escort and defence of the Arctic convoys, and made airfields and support available to British bombers carrying out attacks on the Tirpitz. For this service he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath by the British. After the war Panteleyev served in several staff positions, before being made commander of the Pacific Fleet. Towards the end of his career he maintained an interest in academic affairs, and served in several positions in the Naval Academy, including as its head. Retiring from service, he continued to write, producing several works including his memoirs. He died in 1983, and was buried in Leningrad. The navy honoured his legacy with the naming of the Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Panteleyev. Family and early years sailing competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Both Yuri and his father sailed to watch the competition. Panteleyev was born on in Saint Petersburg, the son of . Aleksandr Panteleyev was the son of the Cossack ataman of the stanitsa, in Rostov Oblast. Aleksandr, a graf (count) before the Russian Revolution, became a film actor and director after it, working at SovKino film studies (later Lenfilm). One of his works was Anatoly Lunacharsky's 1918 film Congestion (), with Aleksandr being awarded the title of . His wife, and Yuri's mother, Anna Alekseevna, also worked at the film studios. Both Aleksandr and Yuri were keen yachtsmen. In 1912, when Yuri was eleven years old, they sailed the yacht Ruslan to Sweden to watch the Russian team competing off Stockholm in the sailing at the 1912 Summer Olympics. In 1917 Yuri graduated from the Second Saint Petersburg Gymnasium, in the last class to graduate before the revolution. With the upheaval of the revolution, Yuri Panteleyev attended volunteer classes at local sailors' club and in March 1918 enlisted at the age of 16 with a group of sailors assigned to guard the institutions of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Navy in Petrograd. He then took a series of navigational courses, and in November 1918 he was appointed to command of the 1st Naval Education Unit, which from August 1919 guarded the mouth of the River Neva on the line between the Lakhta and Sea Canal dam on the Baltic Sea. In March 1921 he took part in the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, commanding a detachment of skiers made up of Komsomol members who carried out reconnaissance of the approaches to Kotlin Island, marking the way for the advancing troops. For this he and nine others of his detachment were awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Panteleyev then took the course for navigators, followed by practical experience as assistant captain on the Soviet sailing merchant ship Lauristin during a voyage to Estonia in summer 1921. Navigator and Black Sea officer In May 1922 Panteleyev was appointed junior navigator of the battleship Marat, and advanced to senior navigator in April 1923. He was sent to Moscow in December 1923 to take further specialist courses in navigation. From December 1923 to February 1925 he studied the Higher Special Courses of the naval command staff, which included practical experience with a voyage aboard the Vorovskiy, which ended in Vladivostok on 20 November 1924, having sailed through the North Sea, past Gibraltar, through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Strait of Malacca, visiting many of the local ports. After graduating from the Academy Panteleyev was sent to serve in the Black Sea Fleet as navigator aboard the submarine Politruk, until July 1925. He would spend the next five years serving on the Black Sea. Shaumyan, Panteleyev's ship from July 1925 to April 1926 From July 1925 to April 1926 Panteleyev was senior assistant to the commander of the destroyer Shaumyan, and then from April 1926 to December 1928 he was senior navigator of the cruiser Chervona Ukraine. His next posting, until October 1930, was an assistant to the head of the combat training department of the Black Sea Fleet. He returned to his studies in October 1930, enrolling in the Naval Academy and graduating in April 1933. Panteleyev was then appointed assistant sector chief of the Combat Training Directorate of the Naval Forces, and in June 1933 became chief of the 1st sector (operational and combat training) of the headquarters of the Northern Military Flotilla, also acting as the flotilla's chief of staff from 25 September to 21 March 1934. During this time a number of warships were transferred from the Baltic Fleet to the White Sea via the White Sea-Baltic Canal. To the Baltic Fleet In April 1935 Panteleyev returned to the Black Sea Fleet as the commander of the 1st submarine brigade until November 1936, and then until August 1938 as commander of the 2nd submarine brigade. In summer 1938 he was transferred to the Navy Commissariat and from August 1938 to October 1939 was member, and then deputy chairman of the State Commission for the Acceptance of Ships. It was at this time that Admiral Ivan Yumashev, then commander of the Pacific Fleet, requested that Panteleyev serve as commander of his minesweeping brigade. Panteleyev agreed, but the appointment was blocked by Naval commissioner N.G. Kuznetsov, who anticipating trouble with Finland, arranged with Stalin to appoint Panteleyev as chief of staff of the Baltic Fleet. destroyer leader Minsk, Panteleyev's ship during operations in the Gulf of Finland during the Soviet-Finnish War In October 1939 Panteleyev became acting chief of staff of the Baltic Fleet, and in June 1940 was confirmed in post, holding this position until 29 August 1941. During the Soviet-Finnish War the Baltic Fleet deployed submarines and patrol ships in the Gulf of Finland, while carrying out air reconnaissance and providing supporting fire against fort artillery. Panteleyev personally carried out reconnaissance of the island of Kopisari, at the entrance to the port of Kotka. His detachment, consisting of the destroyer leader Minsk, two destroyers and several supporting vessels approached the island, but came under fire from a Finnish battery. The Soviets were unable to suppress the Finnish guns and had difficulty in firing on coastal targets because of a lack of spotters to observe the fall of shots. During the battle a shell fragment fell into the fur collar of Panteleyev's coat, a fragment he kept as a souvenir. Promoted to rear admiral on 4 June 1940 Panteleyev was one of the officers based at the fleet headquarters at Tallinn as the possibility of war with Nazi Germany became ever greater. Great Patriotic War =Defending Leningrad= Kirov under a smoke screen during the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn The Navy was one of the only branches of the Soviet military to be at full readiness when the German invasion of the Soviet Union began. It had been placed at readiness No. 2 on 19 June, and at midnight on 21 June commander in chief of the navy Admiral Kuznetsov moved it to readiness No. 1. As Baltic Fleet chief of staff, Panteleyev was heavily involved in bringing the fleet to war readiness. In late August, during the invasion, he participated in the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn, commanding a covering detachment of Soviet warships, and on 1 September took charge of a flotilla of transports, gunboats and other vessels to evacuate part of the 50th Rifle Corps from Koivisto. He described the scene in Tallinn in his diary: > Beat off strong attack on city during the night. Enemy has changed tactics, > infiltrating in small groups ... All airfields captured by the enemy. Our > planes flew off to the east. Fleet and city under bombing and shelling. > Lovely Pirita burning ... Other suburbs also burning. Big fires in the city. > Barricades being built at the approaches to the harbour. Smoke everywhere > ... Fire of ships and shore batteries has not slackened. Our command post at > Minna Harbour constantly under fire. Panteleyev rejoined the Navy Commissariat between September and October 1941, and on 4 October was appointed commander of the Leningrad Naval Base. He held this post, which included the responsibilities of commander of the naval defence of Leningrad and the Ozerny region. In cooperation with army units he organised counterattacks against the German forces at Strelna, and oversaw the evacuation of several divisions of the 8th Army from Oranienbaum to Leningrad. Under Panteleyev's direction the naval defences were divided up into sectors, providing anti-mine and anti-aircraft defence for the city, while naval artillery disrupted enemy attacks. Experienced sailors and yachtsman supported relief efforts entering the city across Lake Ladoga, and also during the winter when the lake froze over. Panteleyev also coordinated naval support for land offensives by troops of the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts in spring 1942. He was also charged with destroying the vessels anchored at Kronstadt, if they could not be saved from an enemy advance, though this did not become necessary. =On the Volga= In April 1942 Panteleyev became Assistant Chief of the Main Naval Staff. His attestation written about this time recorded that he was \\"lively and energetic ... loves naval service, a good commander- sailor.\\" He also edited the naval journal Morskoi Sbornik during his time as Assistant Chief, and in May 1943, took command of the . He was tasked with clearing the Volga between Astrakhan and Kuibyshev of German mines, and of protecting vessels, especially those transporting fuel, from air attacks. Arriving to take up his post on 14 May, all civilian shipping was promptly placed under his command, with operators required to transfer ships and their crews for conversion to warships. Panteleyev compensated the operators by making awards to the rivermen under the same terms as the naval sailors. The mine problem was dealt with by establishing two minesweeping brigades making regular sweeps of the river, and convoys following behind minesweepers. Two more brigades of armed vessels protected convoys from attack, while sailors and the local population were mobilised to watch for enemy minelaying attempts. False river markers were also installed to encourage German aircraft to lay mines outside of the usual shipping channels. Eventually more than 8,000 vessels were involved on the waterway, delivering over 7 million tons of fuel, for which the flotilla was praised by General Vasily Chuikov, commander of the 62nd Army. With the pushing back of the German armies throughout the summer of 1943, the danger of airdropped mines on the Volga lessened, and in late August a number of the flotilla's vessels were transferred to the Dnieper military flotilla. By the end of Panteleyev's time in command in December 1943 751 German mines had been destroyed. =White Sea operations= Leningrad- class destroyer, of the same class as the Baku, Panteleyev's flagship for a time with the In December 1943 Panteleyev was once more appointed Assistant Chief of the Main Naval Staff, and on 29 January 1944, two days after the lifting of the siege of Leningrad, he was promoted to vice admiral. In July 1944 he was appointed commander of the , part of the Northern Fleet, which was responsible for securing sea communications in the White Sea, the eastern part of the Barents Sea, and into the Arctic Ocean, stretching across thousands of square kilometers. Panteleyev often took personal charge of operations; one in particular involved conveying two large icebreakers, Severniy Veter and Stalin from Eastern Arctic waters to Arkhangelsk, where they were needed to keep the approaches to the port open during the winter freeze. Panteleyev assigned eight destroyers, five large patrol craft and five minesweepers to escort the icebreakers. Panteleyev himself oversaw the operation from aboard the destroyer Baku. After rendezvousing with the icebreakers at the entrance to the Kara Strait, in the midst of a Force 10 gale, Panteleyev began to escort them towards their destination. With sonar detecting enemy vessels in the vicinity, Panteleyev chose to avoid the usual route, bypassing the narrows and straits where his ships would be particularly vulnerable. The tactic paid off and the ships safely reached harbour. Operation Paravane, British bombers attacking the Tirpitz. Panteleyev oversaw the arrangements for the use of Soviet facilities and technical support. In 1944, Panteleyev, and the commander of the Northern Fleet's Air Force, became jointly responsible for providing support for attempts by British aircraft to sink the German battleship Tirpitz. Tirpitz was anchored in Norwegian waters, with the distance involved making it hard for British aircraft to launch from British airfields, complete their bombing mission, and then return to their bases. Therefore it was decided that, in what was designated Operation Paravane, the British bombers would instead fly to airfields in the north of the Soviet Union following their raids, refuel and if necessary rearm, and then, if the Tirpitz was still afloat, attempt to bomb her again on their return to Britain. Panteleyev helped to make the necessary arrangements to make Soviet airfields such as Yagodnik available, with Soviet navigators assisting in transferring aircraft and carrying out reconnaissance. On 15 September Tirpitz was crippled by British bombers which staged from Yagodnik, and was later sunk in Operation Catechism by British bombers launched from Scotland. Panteleyev was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his work in assisting the British. In March 1945 he was appointed commander of the White Sea naval defence area, holding the position until after the war, when in July 1946 he became Chief of the Combat Training Directorate. Postwar career =Pacific command= Panteleyev served as Chief of the Combat Training Directorate until April 1947, when he briefly became Deputy Chief of the Main Naval Staff, until July 1947, and then Chief of the Operational Directorate of the Naval General Staff until April 1948. He then became commandant of the Naval Academy, before becoming commander of the 5th Fleet in August 1951. The 5th Fleet had been by splitting the Pacific Fleet into two separate commands, the 5th and 7th Fleets, in 1947. In August 1951 the fleets were recombined into a single Pacific Fleet, with Panteleyev continuing as its commander until January 1956. He had been promoted to admiral on 3 August 1953, and combined his naval career with serving as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 1954 until 1958. In January 1956 he became head of the A. N. Krylov Naval Academy of Shipbuilding and Armaments, serving as a teaching professor there from 1962, and with the merger of the Academy into the main Naval Academy in November 1960, Panteleyev took over the position of the combined institution and held it until January 1967. He remained interested in strategic questions, contributing an article to the 1961 edition of the military journal Voyennaya Mysl on the subject of submarine transports and tankers. =Academic life and later years= Panteleyev's namesake, the Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Panteleyev, in 2012 From April 1967 Panteleyev served as a professor- consultant to the Naval Academy's Academic Council, retiring in March 1968. He had written several non-fiction books during his career, including Naval Armaments of the Baltic Countries (), published in 1933; The Underwater War and the Merchant Fleet () in 1934, and a biography of Admiral Stepan Makarov, published in 1949. In 1965 he published The Sea Front (), and in retirement in 1974 published his memoirs Half a Century in the Navy (). He continued his love of yachting, and in 1958 was awarded the title of Master of Sports. The final part of his memoirs, Sail is my life () appeared posthumously in 1984. Over the course of his career Panteleyev received the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner four times, the Order of Nakhimov First Class and the Order of the Patriotic War First Class, as well as the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, the Order of the Red Star three times, and the British honour of Companion of the Order of the Bath. Panteleyev died on 5 May 1983 and was buried at the Serafimovskoe Cemetery in Leningrad. He was honoured after his death with the naming of the Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Panteleyev, which since 1992 has been part of the Pacific Fleet. Notes a. Two other Soviet officers involved were recommended for British honours; Colonel Loginov, Chief of Staff of the White Sea flotilla, and Major-General Dzymba, Chief of the White Sea Flotilla Naval Air Forces.

Drawing on game theory, Singh argues that a pivotal factor in a coup's success or failure is not its intrinsic popularity but rather its leaders' ability to persuade others that the coup is broadly supported and likely to succeed, while any resistance is negligible and unlikely to prevail. Consequently, seizing control of radio facilities, for instance, can be important as a way to project the impression of the coup's solidified control.

The floor of the rift valley is deep and wide and the bounding rift mountains are at a depth of about , or about above the floor. The rift valley is long and it is offset to the eastward in the north at Fracture Zone A; in the south, it is offset westward at Fracture Zone B.  Methodology  ALVIN submersible of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1978 A significant obstacle in marine surveys was the use of echo sounders with a wide transmit beam, which smeared-out details of the sea floor features. The crustal accretion or creation process was thought to take place over a few kilometers width of sea floor, which was below the resolution of ship echo sounders. Thus, near-bottom and on-bottom approaches were employed along with new sonar mapping tools. Investigations included airborne magnetics, advanced surface ship sonar,Renard, V., Schrumpf, B., and Sibuet, J.

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts provided surface ships and the submersible ALVIN; the French provided surface ships and the bathyscaph Archim√®de and submersible CYANA. The British conducted side scan sonar surveys and on-bottom seismic experiments. Lead institutions were WHOI and the French Centre Oceanologique de Bretagne, Brest, France. Project leaders were James Heirtzler, Claude Riffaud, and Xavier Le Pichon. alt= = Operational challenges = In the 1960s, Canadian scientists had begun a detailed study of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at a latitude of 45¬∞ N that included multiple expeditions by surface ships. With Project FAMOUS located on the ridge in more clement latitudes around 37¬∞ N, a coordinated multi-national, multi-ship series of more than twenty expeditions took place over four years, between 1971 and 1974. Bilateral briefing meetings were held as new expeditions were completed. The unique operational features of Project FAMOUS included the use of newly developed narrow-beam and multibeam echo sounders along with deeply-towed instruments and manned submersibles to achieve a new, higher level of resolution of a spreading center. Key to this approach was improved ship navigation with transit satellites to allow detailed mapping, in an era before GPS. This was augmented by use of acoustic on-bottom transponder navigation of ships, instruments, and submersibles. Besides the approach using instruments with increasing detailed resolution, the submersible divers were trained to recognize the volcanic terrain they could encounter through prior field exercises undertaken in Iceland and Hawaii. The pressure hull of the ALVIN submersible was also specially upgraded to allow it to reach the great depths of the rift valley. In total, forty-four dives with the three submersibles were completed over dive seasons in 1973 and 1974.  Main results  Project FAMOUS represented a new experimental approach to sea floor geology and was considered a major technical achievement at the time. The demonstration of the viability of sea floor observations by submersibles made possible the subsequent discoveries of hydrothermal vents at the Galapagos spreading center and on the East Pacific Rise at 21¬∞ N. The project succeeded in defining the morphology and structure of the spreading center or median rift valley along with locating the zone of crustal accretion in the median valley floor. On the large scale, sonar mapping and deep-tow instrument surveys found that the median valley is asymmetric in shape with the rift mountains on the west about 11 km from the deepest part of the valley floor, and those on the east about 20 km from it. This finding indicated that seafloor spreading here is not the same on either side of the valley floor as might be expected with the most simple idea of the process. Instead, the computed rate is 7 mm/year to the west and 13.4 mm/year to the east. The higher resolution surveys were able to establish that the median valley is formed by faulting and not volcanism. In the FAMOUS area the median valley displays four provinces: the outer walls of the valley, which are normal faults with vertical movements that border the rift mountains; a mostly level terrace of varied width below these walls; inner walls to the valley floor that are also normal faults, and the relatively narrow median valley or rift valley floor at the deepest point. The heights of the rift mountains diminish away from the median valley by additional systems of faults that decrease rather than increase relief. Deeply towed geophysical instruments explored the rift valley floor where most of the dives took place. These efforts observed the zone of crustal accretion aligned along the center of the valley floor. In the FAMOUS area valley floor the accretion zone is marked by several low and elongate volcanic hills about 100‚Äì250 m high and 1‚Äì2 km long. These are bordered by a fissured terrane where the crust is cracked. Divers observed that these hills are constructed mainly of pillow lavas that are without sediment cover, indicating they are new or young. Sediment covers most of the inner valley floor away from these hills indicating accretion is not taking place beyond the hills. Conceptual models suggest that volcanism within the valley floor is cyclic or episodic, with volcanic activity recurring every 5,000 to 10,000 years. The observed continuous background seismicity infers that faulting is continual and ongoing. In the fracture zones explored by dives and deep towed instruments, shear zones a few meters wide were found. These mark the transform faults between adjacent spreading centers and rift valleys. Because the fracture zones are up to 10 km wide in places, this observation indicates the shear zone or transform fault, migrates over time within the fracture zone itself. The bounding fracture zones, A and B are not orthogonal or perpendicular to the rift valley as is expected for transform faults and spreading ridge connections. This has led to the notion that spreading here is oblique to the trend of the rift valley. However. the near- bottom and on-bottom observations find that the narrow shear zones are in fact at right angles to the rift valley trend as would be required by plate tectonics. The observation of pervasive faulting and fracturing of the crust indicated the spreading center was under tension; thus revealing that the driving force for plate motion was a puling apart of the plates rather than a pushing apart from the mantle below. These observations; of the architecture of the median valley, of the fracture zone transform faults, and of the crustal accretion zone, mark the first ground-truth data of plate boundaries for a slow rate spreading center.

The Alps make up the northern section of Lombardy and then shrink into the Prealps, which themselves ease into hills and the valleys of the Po Valley. Along the Prealps are some of the largest lakes in Italy (Garda, Maggiore, and Como) while numerous rivers and streams (Po, Adda, Oglio, Mincio, and the Ticino) cut the mountains into deep and narrow valleys. In a small area of the Oltrep√≤ Pavese rise hills and the . The Lombard Alps are all named after the ancient peoples who dwelled in them in the time of the Roman Empire. The Lepontine Alps are named for the Lepontii, the Rhaetian Alps for the Rhaetians, and the Orobie Alps for the Orobii. There are four prominent massifs in the Lombard Alps: the Bregaglia Range, Piz Bernina, , and the . The first three of these rise between the Rhine and Inn in the north and the Adda and Oglioto in the south and therefore are only partly in Italy. The Adamello Range on the other hand is located between the Adda and Adige and thus entirely within Italy. The highest elevated locality to be found in Lombardy is the secondary peak of the Piz Bernina, La Spedla, at . Another prominent peak is Monte Cevedale, standing tall. The Forni glacier () is located in the Ortles-Cevedale Range. To the west of Lake Maggiore and the east of Lake Garda are the Lombard Prealps, whose peaks average at a little over . They are made up primarily of calcerous sediments, which allowed glaciers to carve their many valleys and rivers now contained within.

The genus of such a surface is g. A genus g surface is a two-dimensional manifold. The classification theorem for surfaces states that every compact connected two- dimensional manifold is homeomorphic to either the sphere, the connected sum of tori, or the connected sum of real projective planes. Definition of genus The genus of a connected orientable surface is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting closed simple curves without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected.Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000. It is equal to the number of handles on it. Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the Euler characteristic œá, via the relationship œá = 2 ‚àí 2g for closed surfaces, where g is the genus. The genus (sometimes called the demigenus or Euler genus) of a connected non-orientable closed surface is a positive integer representing the number of cross-caps attached to a sphere. Alternatively, it can be defined for a closed surface in terms of the Euler characteristic œá, via the relationship œá = 2 ‚àí g, where g is the non-orientable genus. Genus 0 An orientable surface of genus zero is the sphere S2. A non-orientable surface of genus zero is the disc. File:Sphere filled blue.svgA sphere S^2 File:1-ball.svgA closed disc (with boundary) Genus 1 A genus one orientable surface is the ordinary torus. A non-orientable surface of genus one is the projective plane. Elliptic curves over the complex numbers can be identified with genus 1 surfaces. The formulation of elliptic curves as the embedding of a torus in the complex projective plane follows naturally from a property of Weierstrass's elliptic functions that allows elliptic curves to be obtained from the quotient of the complex plane by a lattice.
