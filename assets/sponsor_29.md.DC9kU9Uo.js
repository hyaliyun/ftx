Seagle), and produced by Cartoon Network Studios. The series is about a 10-year-old boy named Ben Tennyson who gets a watch-style alien device called the \\"Omnitrix\\". Attached to his wrist, it allows him to transform into various alien creatures with different abilities, allowing him to fight evil from Earth and space with his cousin Gwen and grandfather Max. The series first aired on Cartoon Network as a sneak peek on December 27, 2005 as part of \\"Sneak Peek Week\\", airing alongside other shows, including My Gym Partner's a Monkey, Robotboy, and Zixx. The show later began airing on January 14, 2006 and ended on April 15, 2008. The series gradually became popular and was nominated for two Emmy Awards, winning one for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation\\". The show would go on to spawn a franchise. Ben 10 was succeeded by Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien, and Ben 10: Omniverse. A remake of the series was launched as the 2016 version.Confirmation of 5th Ben 10 Series by Official Twitter Page of CN PR Premise The series centers around Ben Tennyson (Tara Strong), a ten-year- old boy on a cross-country summer vacation, with his cousin Gwen (Meagan Smith) and their grandfather Max (Paul Eiding). On their first night camping in their grandfather's RV affectionately named the \\"Rustbucket,\\" Ben finds an alien pod with a mysterious watch-style device named the Omnitrix. The device then permanently attaches itself to his wrist giving him the ability to transform into a variety of alien life-forms each with its own unique skills and powers. With his newfound superpowers Ben has to learn the responsibilities of being a hero. During their vacation, the Tennysons are attacked by various enemies ranging from space aliens to supernatural entities. Characters *Benjamin Kirby \\"Ben\\" Tennyson: :Ben is a cocky, immature boy, who is not above enjoying attention and enjoys making jokes even during fights. Though his immaturity makes a bad impression on some people, Ben is good-hearted, noble and loyal, and his actions are motivated above all by a strong and sincere will to help and save others in need. He will stop at nothing to protect his family or anyone in danger whether human or alien. Ben proves to be resourceful, intelligent (Ben has been known to have an eidetic memory), shrewd and cunning when needed, which saved him from many situations, especially when the Omnitrix cannot activate or doesn't provide him with the alien he originally wanted. *Gwendolyn Catherine \\"Gwen\\" Tennyson: :She is depicted as a kind and intelligent girl, very skilled with computers and possessing a level of martial arts skills. She is also very independent but is very organised, sometimes to the point of compulsive, but can be a light- hearted schemer. Overall, her most notable skill is her innate, if latent, ability at magic. She got her powers from her alien grandmother, Verdona Tennyson. She is extremely skilled at magic as in \\"Tough Luck\\" when she picks up Hex's staff to defeat Charmcaster, Charmcaster replies that it can only be worked in the hands of a master magician and Gwen could still fire a yellow energy beam from it, even though she hadn't learned about them. *Grandpa Maxwell \\"Max\\" Tennyson: :Max mentions having spent his childhood summers on his Uncle Jedediah's farm, where he learned about the merits of hard work. A \\"not-quite-all-there\\" Max, under the effects of Zombozo's happiness draining, mentions having been afraid of heights as a kid and then, when \\"enough was enough\\", Max \\"climbed up to the top of the water tower\\" and \\"scared the fear\\" right out of him. It was shown that Max had a childhood friend called Donovan Grand Smith, who sums up Max: \\"growing up he always was the worrywart never the risk-taker\\", like himself. Thirty years earlier, Donovan and Max had both been broke when Donovan offered Max a business opportunity which he turned down. Max later became a Plumber (Donovan thought Max was an actual plumber), establishing that Max's career as a Plumber lasted for about twenty-eight years before he retired (Max mentioned that after twenty-eight years on the job, he'd never figured out who was behind the Bermuda Triangle). It was revealed that Max had been an astronaut and would have been the first man on the moon, but left the program before the Apollo Moon mission. In his own words, Max said he just \\"took his step for mankind in other ways\\". =Main villains= *Vilgax ‚Äì A Chimera Sui Generis warlord regarded as one of the most feared aliens in the galaxy, who stops at nothing to take the Omnitrix, which he wishes to use in order to create a transforming super army. In the past, Vilgax was an enemy of Max. Vilgax was injured and remained in a regeneration chamber in the first season, but when completely healed, he was cybernetically enhanced, giving him colossal size, strength and durability that made him a match for every alien Ben could access at that time, therefore becoming the boy‚Äôs archenemy. Vilgax was the main antagonist of the first season, and was a recurring antagonist in the following seasons. **Sixsix ‚Äì A Sotraggian bounty hunter **Kraab ‚Äì A Piscciss Premann bounty hunter *Kevin Ethan Levin ‚Äì An 11-year-old delinquent sociopath with a mutant power that allows him to absorb energy. He uses the ability to commit crimes to benefit himself, never caring if it hurts anyone. He originally wanted to team up with Ben to become unstoppable, but after Ben refuses the offer, he absorbs power from the Omnitrix instead. He uses this to frame Ben for robberies using the alien forms, but the constant changes makes his DNA unstable and he eventually becomes a combination of all ten of the alien forms. Becoming a monster makes him hate Ben more than ever, as he blames him for his new form, and he swears revenge, becoming Ben's secondary archenemy and foil: \\"Kevin 11\\". Kevin is a minor antagonist in the first season, the main antagonist of the second season and a minor antagonist in the fourth season. *Zs'Skayr ‚Äì An Ectonurite high king whose rule over the Anur star system saw an opportunity to expand when he learned of the Omnitrix from one of Vilgax's crash-landed data probes. Searching the galaxy, he tried to sample Florana DNA into the Omnitrix but ended up having his own DNA sampled along with it, becoming the genetic donor of Ghostfreak. His powers include invisibility, intangibility, possession, tentacles, energy beam projection, telekinesis and firing energy beams from his hands. He was a minor antagonist in the second season and the main antagonist of the third season. **Doctor Viktor **The Yelnodooshi **The Mummy *The Forever Knights ‚Äì A secret British paramilitary organization formed during the Middle Ages and evolved into an international syndicate that first came to the United States in the 1920s. **Driscoll / Forever King ‚Äì A former Plumber kicked out in disgrace after being caught stealing technologies from alien criminals for personal gain, who joined the Forever Knights and eventually became their leader with the goal of achieving world domination. After learning of the Plumbers' secret \\"sub-energy\\" weapon the Forever King assembles the Negative 10, a team of the Tennysons' human enemies, to steal it to achieve his goal. He was the main antagonist of season four. **Enoch ‚Äì *Dr. Aloysius James Animo ‚Äì A promising veterinary scientist whose career was cut short when he was discovered performing twisted genetic experiments on animals. He had hoped that his research would win him the Verties Award. Because of the nature of his research, he lost the award to another doctor named Kelly. This drove him insane, and he dropped off the map for five years until he could perfect his research. After being defeated by Ben for the first time, Dr. Animo makes himself a personal nemesis to the boy, always hoping to defeat him and rule the world. His powers include controlling animals, reviving them and creating them. He is Ben's tertiary archenemy. *Hex ‚Äì A self-proclaimed master magician and sorcerer from the inter-dimensional world of Ledgerdomain. **Charmcaster ‚Äì Hex's gifted 15-year-old niece, who at first appears loyal to her uncle but was actually using him to get power for herself. She later attempts to use a spell to swap bodies with Ben in order to gain possession of the Omnitrix only to switch with Gwen by mistake and be foiled, and have her spell book stolen by Gwen. She later becomes a member of the Negative 10 to get revenge on the Tennysons, though her grudge is mainly against Gwen. Her powers include mana manipulation and spellcasting. She is Gwen's archenemy.

Gordon's original concepts for Ben 10, in which a red-haired Ben Tennyson uses the Omnitrix to transform into ten human superheroes. =Development= Ben 10 was created by \\"Man of Action\\" and was produced by Cartoon Network Studios. Man of Action is a group consisting of comic book creators Duncan Rouleau, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Steven T. Seagle. The group worked on Ben 10's concept roughly 3 years before Cartoon Network picked up the series. Dave Johnson also helped in the design development. Early on in development, it was decided that a villain would be within the Omnitrix. After Ghostfreak was created the creators added dialogue into the first season to give the audience that there is something more to Ghostfreak.The Complete Second Season: Commentary for \\"Ghostfreak Out\\" (DVD). Warner Bros Entertainment. Originally Cannonbolt the 11th alien transformation in the series, was going to be in the original set of aliens, but was replaced with Ghostfreak. When doing test animations for the series the first alien transformation to be tested was Four Arms. It was the most popular transformation out of all the aliens for \\"Man of Action\\". Many of the unused designs for Upchuck were recycled in the episode \\"Ben 10,000\\" as two of Ben's aliens \\"Spitter\\" and \\"Articguana\\", and as villain Sploot. Steven E. Gordon worked on an early version of the show. His concept work reveals that Ben Tennyson was originally going to be a red-headed young boy. Gordon also has early designs of the Omnitrix which look more like a watch than the final version, as well as different designs and names for the alien transformations. Some of the early names for the transformations were \\"StrongGuy\\", \\"Inferno\\", \\"RazorJaws\\", \\"Dragonfly\\", \\"Plantguy\\", and \\"Digger\\". Some of the early designs for the aliens are more human and superheroic, similar to Dial H For Hero. Sunmin Image Pictures, Dong Woo Animation and Lotto Animation, Inc. contributed some of the animation for this series. =Theme song= The theme song for the series was written by Andy Sturmer and sung by Mz. Moxy. The main title were created by Renegade Animation, who was well-known for Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, which was created by Ben 10's executive producer Sam Register. The flash animated sequence during the main title was designed to let the audience know that the show is going to be fun and not just an action show.The Complete First Season: Commentary for \\"Secrets\\" (DVD). Warner Bros Entertainment.

A trailer of the film was released with the film Billy & Mandy: Wrath of the Spider Queen, and it aired August 10, 2007. Michael Ouweleen described the film's villain, which was actually Vilgax, as \\"like Darth Vader without the sense of humor.\\" A different version of Secrets of the Omnitrix, which introduced a different alien (Eye Guy) to the one in the original (Heatblast), aired on September 1, 2007. A third version (in which XLR8 was featured) aired on October 20, 2007. It was stated during the premiere of Alien Force that Secret of the Omnitrix was intended to be the chronological finale of Ben 10, even though it was broadcast long before the last episode, which was not canon.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 3 October 2005. She was written out in 2006 after new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood took over and axed a number of characters. Storylines Olivia split up with her long-term boyfriend Julian before moving to Hollyoaks to study history. She found it hard to adjust to student life. She became close friends with Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall), but lived in her shadow as she was not as outgoing as Jessica or their new friend Steph Dean (Carley Stenson). Olivia's closest thing to a relationship was her bond with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), which he described as friends who sometimes have sex. She proved to be a good friend to Jessica in her relationship troubles with Mark Jury (Ash Newman) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan), and began learning to be more assertive as she was often walked all over by others. She and Jessica did a naked protest, as they were fired from Il Gnosh by Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) when Jessica became ill from meningitis. The local newspaper came to cover the story and Olivia \\"accidentally\\" told them about Jessica playing Gilly and Mark against each other. However, Jessica decided to forgive Olivia and the two stayed friends until Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy), a new student, arrived and saw that Jessica was bossing Olivia around. Kris taught Olivia to stick up for herself and one night at The Dog in the Pond public house, she told Jessica that she wasn't going to be her slave anymore; this upset Jessica and unfortunately this was their last conversation. Sam Owen (Louis Tamone) came into the pub and set fire to it; a beam fell down onto Olivia pinning her down. Joe Spencer (Joe Milburn) came in to look for her and pulled her out, but the spirit bottles fell from the shelves and into the fire and exploded, which killed both Joe and Olivia. Olivia continued to have a presence on the show after her death. Kris used some of her diary entries to hurt Jessica soon after Olivia was killed. Her face, along with the faces of Joe and the Burton twins, were put on a mural at the centre of town. When Jessica left the village in December 2007, she took one final look at the mural. Hollyoaks characters Television characters introduced in 2005 Female characters in television ","title":"Olivia Johnson"},{"id":"3501919","text":"Jessica Harris is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks, played by Jennifer Biddall. She debuted on-screen during episodes airing in October 2005. Biddal decided to leave the serial in December 2007, Jessica last appeared on 31 December 2007, And Biddall has since admitted she doesn't want to return to the serial. Jessica's notable storylines include affairs, being unlucky in love, gambling and a carbon monoxide plot. Casting In 2005, Jessica was created by executive producer David Hanson and actress Jennifer Biddall was cast into the role. In 2007, it was revealed that Biddall had quit the serial in order to pursue other projects. Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood stated: \\"Jenny Biddall is in the pipeline to be leaving at the end of the year. She steps rather too readily into Zoe's shoes when Darren starts on his winning streak and they form a Bonnie and Clyde partnership which is very funny but she leaves in a dramatic twist in the New Year episode.\\" Biddall later said she wouldn't consider a permanent return to Hollyoaks. Character development During an interview with the BBC, Biddall spoke about Jessica, she described her as: \\"She's a new university student studying Marketing and Advertising. She's confident, outgoing, she wants to be the life and soul and she's had a long term boyfriend since she was 15. She's part of the perfect couple and she's hoping to stay with him, so we'll see how that one pans out.\\" Jessica only sees status as an attractive quality in males, commenting on this Biddall adds: \\"My character tends to go for the ones who have a bit of a status. So I think she quite likes Lee, who's the student president, there's a bit of an interest there. But she might have a few surprises up her sleeve and she might not necessarily go for the guy you'd expect her to.\\" BBC America describe her as \\"The spoiled little rich girl always has Daddy on the line if she breaks a nail.\\" They also say it isn't wise to \\"call her a snob\\" because she \\"just used to the finer things in life.\\" They also state that \\"she's not beyond working for her keep, or fraternizing with the plebes. Quite the contrary, she quite fancies people who are different from her. For instance, she's had a romance with the quite-offbeat, usually penniless Gilly Roach. However, she does have a boyfriend from home named Mark.\\" A writer from E4.com described her as having an extremely turbulent love life. In 2007 Jessica was involved in a high-profile storyline in which she held a house party in which she has a boiler illegally fixed. It resulted in a carbon monoxide leak, which it was then revealed had helped save a viewers life who was going through exactly the same ordeal at the time of viewing. Cordinly stated: \\"The only respite I had in the middle of all my pain was Hollyoaks. I can‚Äôt believe I owe my life to it.\\" Storylines When Jessica first arrived she couldn't be parted from her mobile phone and her link to ex-boyfriend Mark Jury (Ash Newman) but over time it seems she was drifting apart from her long-term boyfriend. When Mark turned up at the college Jessica had to retrieve a letter she sent dumping him for Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan). The two stayed together until the letter finally showed up revealing all. Mark and Gilly battled for her affections when she was in hospital for meningitis but she couldn't decide between them, so she wanted to date both of them. She later dumped Mark and Gilly saying that it was unfair on both of them. She and Olivia Johnson (Rochelle Gadd) protested about the fact that they were unfairly sacked at Il Gnosh, going to lengths such as a naked sit-in. Her best friend, Olivia, died in The Dog in the Pond fire which left her heartbroken even though she didn't want to show it. New flatmate Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy), who had convinced Olivia to stand up for herself, taunted and insulted Jessica for not being a true friend to Olivia, going so far as to read to Jessica unflattering comments Olivia had made in her diary. In autumn 2006, she battled with Will Hackett (Oliver Farnworth) for the position of Editor of HCC's school newspaper. She got the position by using Russ Owen's (Stuart Manning) social anthropology research on the class differences between the Owens and the McQueens as her article, which caused Russ and Mercedes to break up for a while. Jessica and Kris have had a somewhat turbulent relationship. Kris kissed a man in front of Jessica to make her jealous. In return, to make Kris jealous, she kissed Elliot Bevan (Garnon Davies), who had a crush on her. In early 2007 they were locked in the flat bathroom together, and finally admitted their attraction for one another. They were leaning in to kiss when flatmate Will opened the door. Kris stood up for Jessica against Will, Kris tried to throw her out of his room by saying \\"It looks as if we're done here\\" Jessica then continues to slam Kris' door with them both inside, saying \\"We are far from being done,\\" before kissing him passionately. The two are seen continuing to kiss and falling back onto Kris' bed. They end up making love and in the morning they seemed to be happy with what had happened until they began to argue again. In an emotional twist in the storyline, Jessica feared for her health after Kris is tricked into believing that he is HIV positive after Will changed Kris's negative drug test results. Jessica had an HIV test which comes back negative. A few days later, Kris found out he was also HIV negative, but had a difficult time forgiving Jessica for her reaction. In March 2007, Jessica discovered that her father had been declared bankrupt, thus putting an end to her glamorous lifestyle and plunging her into the harsh realities of being a strapped-for-cash student. She slept with Kris's brother Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace), to make Kris jealous and get back at him for sleeping with Nathan. Jessica also helped Kris tell Malachy about his cross-dressing, bisexual nature. Malachy at first was disgusted but after speaking to Kris, ended up thinking that it was just a phase he was going through, although Kris knows differently. Jessica and Kris also slept together again, but Kris admitted to Jessica that he's only good for sex at the minute, Jessica seemed to be able to understand that and continued to support Kris. Kris then left town for several months. Jessica was told about Freeganism by Elliot when she was unable to afford food, however rather than taking wasted food from the Ashworth's store she took food off the storeroom shelves. Due to Jessica's shortage of money, bailiffs visited her room and took some of her belongings. Jessica tried desperately to find money. After Tony refused to give her job back, OB offered her a job as MOBS, dressing as a Strawberry. A passerby offered her a job surveying property for resale at a high mark-up. Jessica soon began to feel guilty about conning people, however desperate for money, she scammed items for Jack and Frankie and then spend the money on new clothes. When Frankie found out she was angry and kicked Jessica out of The Dog in The Pond. On 30 August her father returned and offered to repay her debts for her, claiming he had gotten his money back. However her father was still bankrupt and wanted to use Jessica to seduce a potential business partner. However he was arrested before he could close the deal. Jessica was upset at this and refused to visit her father in prison, until Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley) convinced her. Her father told her she was just like him, telling her he had stashed ¬£1000 in the flat. He said she would more likely spend the money on herself then paying her debts. After some consideration, Jessica gave the money to Darren as repayment for conning him earlier. When the hot water goes Jessica asks Danny Valentine (David Judge) to fix it cheaply for the housewarming party for John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) plus to welcome Kris back. Problem is that the boiler goes wrong and carbon monoxide fills the room. The smoke alarm goes off as a warning but Zak takes it out. The carbon monoxide makes everybody at the party feel ill. During this party Kris and Jessica danced together and shared a brief moment before it was ruined by Darren, Jessica said that she has missed him and they had been emailing each other over summer. Jessica was terrified she would be sued, but the school sent her a letter claiming all responsibility. When John Paul moved into the halls, Jessica gave him Elliot's room and lied to him that he had to pay her money she would then give to the school. This went on for some weeks until Elliot returned to find his belongings clumsily thrown into another room, some of them broken. He locked himself in her room for hours and hours as a protest, only to leave when he had to go to the bathroom. Meanwhile, John Paul moved back home. When Zoe asked Jessica to place some money on a horse Jessica decided after much debating to treat herself with the money and lie to Zoe and say the horse lost, Zoe already found out the horse won and came to collect her money from an empty-handed Jessica. The tension between them ended in a fist fight when Jessica got drunk at the Freshers' ball, spilt a drink on Zoe's new dress and ripped it. On Friday 23 November, Jessica slept with Zoe's boyfriend Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson), after the pair had some luck at a casino, which led to them sleeping together on the pool table in The Dog in The Pond with money scattered around them. Two days after their steamy encounter on the pool table Jessica and Darren slept together again but both regretted it. Kris then found out and Jessica and Kris had a confrontation where Kris worked about Jessica and Darren's affair and Darren and Jessica going to the casino behind Zoe's back and the whole conversation was recorded on the radio. Zoe and the whole of Hollyoaks heard it and this led to Zoe moving out of the student flats. Zoe then got revenge by writing crude insults on Jessica's door and throwing her clothes all around the village. Jessica got her own back by editing Zoe's instructional video for Evissa salon to make it seem as if Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna) was prostituting herself. When Darren arranged a poker game with Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) in the loft, Jessica came with him. The stakes got very high and Darren offered Warren his half of The Dog in The Pond - he promptly lost it to Warren. A couple of days later whilst walking through the village, Darren and Jessica followed a drunk Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee) home, so Darren can confront Warren. They walk in to find Louise passed out on the bed. Jessica and Darren see Evissa's takings on the bedside table and decide to steal the money. The following day, Jessica and Darren went to the casino with Evissa's takings and won ¬£200,000. Jessica asked Darren what they would spend their money on, and Darren revealed that he was going use the money to buy The Dog in The Pond back from Warren. He also revealed that he planned to get back together with Zoe, much to the shock of Jessica. On New Year's Eve, Darren and Warren had a showdown and when Warren asked for the money on the stroke of midnight, Darren was shocked to discover that all of his money was gone. As Darren frantically searched for the money, Jessica departed Hollyoaks village for good - ¬£200,000 richer.

Casting In July 2005, it was announced that the serial's production team planned to write out some of their established characters. Kris Green of Digital Spy said he had heard that Greenwood's contract would not be renewed. In November, it was reported Greenwood had already finished filming with the series. Greenwood said that she was already pursuing other projects. Producers remained secretive about how they would write Zara out of the series. Storylines Zara was introduced as the youngest member of the Morgan clan. Zara struggled to settle in Hollyoaks and as a result caused endless trouble at her new school, culminating in her trying to burn down her school after an argument about her art project, and she was sent for psychological assessment. Zara was affected by her parents' marriage problems and often found herself second to her elder siblings, especially Luke Morgan, who was trying to cope with his rape ordeal, and later Adam Morgan, after he was paralysed. Zara was also very protective of her family as she defended her father after her mother was dating another man. She also supported Adam through his disability and Beth Morgan through her trial. Zara was friends with Steph Dean, who proved to be a bad influence on her, and later she made friends with Abby Davies, who proved to be a more grounded friend than Steph, but who was not averse to getting into trouble. After causing trouble by inventing a fictitious relationship with Paul Millington, Zara set her sights on Brian Drake. She became a Goth and won his heart, only later to lose him to Steph and then Lisa Hunter. Zara then began to grow up into a young woman, but was hurt when she realised she had to leave for France; however, Abby kindly offered Zara a place to stay with the Davies'. Since Brian, Zara didn't have many love interests, but did share a brief kiss with Norman Sankofa, who wasn't interested. After a visiting her parents in France, Zara returned and boasted about losing her virginity to a French guy named Hugo. Soon Hugo turned up in Hollyoaks in search of Zara, leaving her to tell the truth that she was still a virgin. Her virginity wasn't to last long as Zara turned her attentions to Abby's boyfriend Lee Hunter (Alex Carter). She ended up having a one-night stand with him, in which she lost her virginity. However, Lee didn't want much more to do with Zara and as soon as their secret got out, her friendship with Abby was at risk. Soon after, the pair eventually made up, but Zara still had a keen interest in Lee. She began to date Cameron Clark, but only to make Lee jealous, and that relationship didn't work out either. With the departure of Abby leaving for Brighton, Zara felt more isolated than ever. She moved into the halls at Hollyoaks Community College. It was there she started a law degree, something she became interested in a couple of years previously after her sister Beth Morgan was raped by Scott Anderson. She soon took a shine to fellow Law student Sam Owen but he wasn't interested and eventually Zara found comfort with English literature student Freddy Watson, but it wasn't to last as Zara was thrown out of HCC after she tried to break into the college to try to help Lee after he had been framed by Chris Fenwick for a fire in the media lab which had actually been started by Freddy for an animal rights demonstration.

The character first appeared in February 2005 as the feisty, glamorous girlfriend of Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson). McKee has been nominated for several awards for her portrayal of the character. In 2008, it was revealed McKee had quit her role as Louise and planned to depart later in the year. She made her final appearance in December 2008 when fianc√© Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) murdered her on their wedding day. Creation and casting Roxanne McKee portrays Louise Summers. Actress Roxanne McKee auditioned for the role of Louise in 2004 as part of Hollyoaks: On the Pull, a nationwide search to find a new actor for Hollyoaks. After being chosen from over 35,000 applicants, McKee began portraying Louise, who was introduced by series producer David Hanson in 2005. In 2008, McKee hinted at a possible exit for her character, despite refusing claims that she wanted to leave. She told Look Magazine: \\"I'm not going to be there forever. I don't mind the long hours but I'll have been doing that for four years in October when my contract ends.\\" After her contract ended in October, McKee decided to leave the show in order to focus on other projects, mainly theatre. Several months after her final on-screen appearance, tabloid newspapers began to speculate that McKee would reprise the role to coincide with the exit of Jamie Lomas's character, Warren. McKee had previously told Digital Spy: \\"Well, Louise might not be dead! That's the exciting twist in the future....On screen, you'll feel like she's dead but depending on me and whether I want to come back for an episode in March ‚Äî I might be back. I filmed an extra scene showing that I'm still alive. There are flashbacks which show me being killed, but then there's a flashback which viewers won't see for a while, that will be used if I choose to come back for the episode. I kind of want to come back and finish off Louise's storyline, but at the moment, I might be doing something else. It would be really good, though ‚Äî I'd be going back to kill a few people off.\\" Character development Following McKee's decision to leave, she said: \\"I have enjoyed my time at Hollyoaks immensely and I'm going to really miss everyone at Lime Pictures. I have learned so much and will take away with me many happy memories ‚Äî not just from everyone I have worked with but from Liverpool as a city too, which has become my second home. I know I will shed a few tears on the day I leave but I am so excited about what the future holds.\\" Hollyoaks series producer Bryan Kirkwood commented on her departure, stating: \\"As well as being the nation's sexiest soap star for two years running, Roxanne has worked incredibly hard to prove herself as a talented actress. She has been at the centre of one of our biggest storylines for the past two years and her exit scenes will be a fitting climax. Roxanne is a real star in the making and I'm sure this won't be the last that we hear of her.\\" Louise's final storyline featured her form a plan with Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn) to make Louise's fianc√© Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) admit to the murder of Louise's former husband Sean Kennedy (Matthew Jay Lewis). However, another twist saw Louise plan to kill Warren and frame Mandy for the murder. Despite this, Warren foiled Louise's plan and ended up killing her. In an interview with Digital Spy, McKee explained her initial desire for the climax to Louise's storyline. She said: \\"I've known for over a year that I've wanted to leave, so I went to the writers last year to let them know that I wouldn't be signing another contract and asked for a nice exit at the same time. It ended up that they've given me a fantastic exit! I originally asked for Louise to commit suicide because I thought that would have been a good exit for her after everything she's been through. But it turned out that I got an even better exit!\\" After being told of her exit, McKee admitted, \\"I was so pleased with it. It's the kind of script that you can get your teeth into. Although I have to admit that Louise has always had something to get her teeth into. It's not like I've been unlucky with storylines ‚Äî they've always been heavy and quite gritty.\\" Lysette Anthony was cast as Louise's mother Yvonne Summers. Storylines =Backstory= Louise grew up without a father, and only her mother Yvonne (Lysette Anthony). In 2008, Louise's mother was introduced. Roxanne McKee commented on Louise and Yvonne's relationship, saying: \\"You see a softer, vulnerable side to Louise when she's around her mum. She's like a shy child due to the way her mum has treated her. You see why Louise is as cold as she is.\\" After leaving home, Louise moved to Ibiza. There she met Sean Kennedy (Matthew Jay Lewis).

While on holiday with Mandy Hutchinson (Sarah Jayne Dunn) and Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) in Hollyoaks: Back from the Dead, the three ladies eventually end up at a country house owned by Louise's estranged husband, Sean. They had been involved in a time share scam in Ibiza, started by Sean, and Louise had left him when she caught him in bed with a barmaid. Sean follows Louise to Hollyoaks for a reconciliation. While she denies she has feelings for him, it becomes obvious that she does. They eventually get back together. However, Sean's old friend, Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas), whom he had caused to be put in prison, turns up for ¬£100,000, which of course Sean does not have after setting up beauty salon, Evissa. Instead of the money, Sean offers Warren one night with Louise. Louise reluctantly agrees, under the impression it is Warren's idea. When Louise meets Warren in a hotel room, she finds out that it was Sean who put forward the idea. She returns to Sean, who lies about offering her to Warren. Louise then asks him for a divorce due to his lies. Before his departure, Sean is made to sign Evissa and his and Louise's flat over to Warren. As Sean leaves for good, Warren feels guilty and gives Louise half of Evissa and makes her the manager. Louise becomes friends with Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna) and Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson), who she hires at Evissa to replace Sophie and Mel who died in a fire. Warren moves into the flat with Louise and there is clearly chemistry between the pair. They began going on dates until Louise catches Warren snorting cocaine with Clare in the toilets of The Loft, disgusted at what she has seen, she quickly ends it with Warren. Warren begins to try to get Louise back, however she goes on holiday and meets a man named Andy. They become lovers and she begins to hope for a relationship with him, however a woman calls her and reveals she is married to Andy. After, Louise begins a relationship with Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle). Sean returns to the village asking for money from Louise. Louise refuses and he ends up hitting her, which leaves her with a black eye. Warren returns from a holiday and discovers Louise's black eye. She covers up saying it was a burglar, however he discovers it was Sean and he gives him the money he wants. Louise and Calvin then become engaged. Unknown to Louise, before Sean manages to leave with her and Warren's money, Warren locks him in a cab and drives off. Warren kills Sean by accident after a struggle in a forest. Warren buries him. The police acknowledge Sean's disappearance and begin to search for him. Louise assumes that Warren is behind it and confronts him. Warren denies everything. Aware the police are searching for him, Warren, with the help of Justin Burton (Chris Fountain), goes to the forest and digs Sean up. Sean had left a note for Calvin saying that Louise had taken drugs in Ibiza and helped him out in his dodgy business. Calvin believes everything and does not give Louise a chance to explain. He then breaks off the engagement. Louise is comforted by Warren and they end up sleeping together. Warren admits that he has loved Louise for a long time. However, Calvin apologises, they get back together and she moves in with the Valentines. When Louise forces Justin to move out of the house, he confronts her and tells her he knows that she slept with Warren. Louise discovers she is pregnant and does not know if either Warren or Calvin are the father. She tells Calvin, who is thrilled over the prospect over being a father. Clare convinces Louise to have an abortion. Clare tells Louise to tell Calvin that she had a miscarriage, not to arouse suspicion. After learning of Sean's murder, Louise goes to visit his mother. Clare tells Calvin everything about the abortion and her affair with Warren. On Louise's return, Calvin is furious and throws her clothes out. She is left to pick up her clothes off the street with a smug Clare watching. Louise moves in with the McQueens. Louise spots Clare and punches her before attacking her in the street. Louise then becomes a suspect for an attempted murder of Clare, who is pushed over The Loft balcony. Louise becomes worried and cannot remember anything on the night of Clare's attempted murder. She inevitably believes she had pushed Clare and tells Warren she will hand herself in. Calvin and Louise agree to be each other's alibis for the night Clare was pushed. They end up sleeping together. Calvin tells her that he was distracted and does not want to get back together. Louise visits Warren in prison and tells him she thinks she may have been responsible. Louise finds out that Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) slept with Warren on the night of Clare's attack but is still refusing to give him an alibi because it will destroy her relationship with Russ Owen (Stuart Manning). Louise sets off for the church where Russ and Mercedes are getting married and interrupts the ceremony, informing everyone of Mercedes and Warren's affair. Mercedes convinces Russ that Louise is lying. Louise is then punched and thrown out of the wedding by Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper). Darren admits to calling a taxi for Louise on the night of Clare's attack. Louise is then removed from investigation by the police. Mercedes decides to do the right thing and admits at Warren's court case that he was with her on the night of the attack, this ultimately ends her marriage to Russ. After being found not guilty, Louise and Warren kiss and she tells him she loves him. Louise has doubt when Warren tells her he will change his ways. Warren makes Clare sell him The Loft after threatening to kill her. Louise, Warren, Justin, O.B. (Darren Jeffries), Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) and Katy Fox (Hannah Tointon) show up at The Loft to make sure Clare leaves. Clare then leaves, but returns in secret to kidnap Katy, demanding that Warren kills Justin after finding out he was the one who tried to kill her. Clare ends up going over a quarry into water in her car and is incorrectly presumed dead. Louise and Warren then start afresh. Louise calls an old acquaintance of Warren's and tells him to offer Warren a dodgy deal. Warren refuses and Louise feels guilty she could not trust him. The police call Louise and tell her they had found a body matching Sean's description. She goes to identify it with a terrified Warren, but it is revealed not to be Sean. Katy keeps on pressurising Warren to tell Louise that he killed Sean. Katy and Justin rush to Louise's flat to tell Louise. Warren ends up asking Louise to marry him, seeing no other option. Warren throws a surprise engagement party at The Loft for Louise. Warren tells Louise he knows she phones his old friend to offer him a job dealing with stolen goods and they end up having an argument. Louise leaves and goes to Evissa, just as Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) arrives to get revenge on Warren by setting a fire. Louise tries to escape but ends up getting knocked out and left for dead, however, Calvin saves her. Warren discovers Ste is responsible for the fire and beats him up. Louise, in hospital, apologises to Warren and tells him she loves him. After Evissa was refurbished, Louise decided to start hairdressing and hired Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane), who Warren assumed was mugging Louise. During a game of poker, Warren bets The Loft against Darren's half of The Dog in the Pond. Warren wins and tells Louise he has got The Dog for her Christmas, however she assumes he has conned Darren into selling it until he tells her he won it fairly and legally. Louise feels guilty knowing Frankie would be devastated. Warren and Louise go to the pub and tell Jack and Frankie they now own half of the pub. Jack is in shock and collapses with a heart attack, but luckily survives. Frankie begins to struggle with sharing The Dog. Warren's old friends, Carl and Anthony, turn up and hold everyone, including Frankie, Jack, Barry \\"Newt\\" Newton (Nico Mirallegro) and Louise at gunpoint demanding money. Jack refuses to give any money to them. Warren turns up as Anthony drags Louise by her hair. Warren apprehends them and struggles to get the gun off them but is knocked unconscious. Newt secretly calls the police. As armed police arrive on scene, Anthony and Carl use Louise and Jack as human shields to escape the pub without being arrested. Darren realises it is partly his fault his dad's life is in danger and runs to help, however he is shot by Anthony, who then escapes as Carl is arrested. The following day, Louise books into a hotel and tells Warren that she has had enough. Warren manages to persuade her not to leave him. Warren decides to get Louise back on side by giving Jack and Frankie his half of The Dog. Louise realises he wants to make amends and forgives him. Louise catches Katy and Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley) kissing in The Loft but after a talk, promises not to tell Justin. Meanwhile, Sean's body is found and Warren confesses to Louise that he killed him. Louise is shocked and is angry to discover that Katy knew about it, as revenge, she exposes her and Zak's affair to Warren. Louise decides to be Warren's alibi for the night of Sean's death, which infuriates Katy. Katy tells Warren to admit to the murder and pay for his crime, but he refuses. Katy hits Warren and leaves. Justin catches Katy and Zak kissing and runs out. She chases after him but he does not want to hear what she has to say. Katy decides to leave the village for good. As Katy is leaving in a taxi, Louise and Warren stop it and Louise violently drags Katy out of the car and confronts her. Warren tells Louise to let him and Katy talk. Warren tries to get her to stay, but Katy tells him he and Louise are pathetic and deserve each other. She then leaves. Louise is arrested as the police believed she killed Sean. Warren gets Darren to persuade his stepbrother, Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre), who has just been put in a mental hospital, to confess to the murder in exchange for ¬£100,000 which Darren can use to pay off his family debts. When Louise finds out, she is not happy about the arrangement and even suggests to Warren that he confesses that he was responsible. Warren refuses and Louise is released. Warren gets Darren to plant Sean's wallet in Jake's flat. Frankie accuses Louise of framing her son. Louise begins to turn to alcohol to deal with Warren's lies. Mandy returns to the village in mid-2008 and the pair team up and become wedding planners. They begin to plan the wedding of Carmel and Calvin. Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) begins stirring things up in Warren and Louise's relationship by insisting that Warren was cheating with Mandy. Louise is angry and accuses them of sleeping together, not knowing they are planning her wedding to Warren. Louise finally realises Cindy is lying. Louise gets drunk and brings up Sean in an argument with Warren. Warren goes to The Loft and ends up sleeping with Mandy. Drunken Louise is locked out of the flat and ends up sleeping in a skip. Warren and Mandy are caught in their affair by Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal), who agrees not to say anything. Louise finds a pair of Mandy's pants in the flat and confronts Warren, who tells her that Cindy had tried to seduce him and had planted the pants to make Louise jealous. Louise attacks Cindy, who claims she is innocent. Warren tells Mandy he wants to run away with her. After a fight with Louise, Warren goes to The Loft before running away with Mandy, there, he is beaten up by Mark Gascoyne (Craig Russell) and left for dead. Mandy is left waiting in the rain and assumes she has been stood up. Warren returns from hospital to be looked after by Louise. Mandy visits him and asks if he still wants to leave with her. Warren states that he is happy with Louise and no longer wants to leave with her. Warren insults Mandy, who then tells Louise about the affair. Louise decides to get revenge on Warren and comes up with a plan with Mandy to tell the police he killed Sean before leaving with his money after the wedding. Louise watches a CCTV tape of Warren and Mandy's affair and decides to get revenge on her as well by killing Warren and pinning it on Mandy before leaving with his money. Louise is horrified when she discovers she is pregnant. She gets a gun which she will use to kill Warren. On the day of the wedding, Warren hires himself and Louise a private suite for the night of the wedding. Louise hides the gun under her pillow, so she can shoot him after the wedding. However, Warren enters the room whilst Louise is not there and hides a Christmas present for Louise under her pillow but finds the gun. Louise enters the room and is shocked to see Warren sitting in a chair. Warren gives Louise her present and reveals he has the gun. Warren wants to know why she has a gun. Louise tells Warren that he has made her life miserable and how he killed her one true love, Sean. She reveals she knows about his and Mandy's affair. Warren pleads with her, telling her that he can change, but Louise refuses to believe it. She then takes the gun and pulls the trigger, however, Warren reveals he had removed the bullets before she entered the room. Warren tries to stop her from leaving and is angry that she tried to kill him. Warren is then seen sitting crying as Louise's motionless body lies on the bed beside a pillow, suggesting he used it to kill her. However, whether Louise died or not would only be revealed the following year, when Warren admitted to Calvin that he had killed her. On 13 February 2009, a Valentine's Day card was sent to Warren signed by Louise. However it was revealed that Sasha sent the card. On 11 May 2011, Warren confessed to his former girlfriend Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) that he killed Louise. Warren was arrested for her murder in December 2011, when the police discover him at the location where he buried her. In June 2016, Warren was released from prison off-screen but returned to the village on 1 July 2016 after the help of his solicitor James Nightingale (Gregory Finnegan).

The character first appeared on 6 July 2005. Since the character's inception she has been involved in many notable storylines such as: a love triangle; coping with the death of her eldest sister Becca (Ali Bastian); marrying Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre); drug abuse; domestic violence; being the victim of two attempted rapes by Jake and Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice); marrying Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson); suffering a miscarriage; prematurely giving birth to Darren's son Oscar Osborne who is deaf; an addiction to painkillers; a highly-publicised storyline where Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) attempts to steal Darren and her family away from her; Sienna seriously attacking her which gives her brain damage; her affair with Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener); a fling with Rick's son Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham); discovering Darren and Maxine Minniver (Nikki Sanderson) buried Patrick Blake's (Jeremy Sheffield) body in village wall and helping cover their tracks; and accidentally running over her friend and colleague John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) resulting in his blindness; discovering her husbands affair with Mandy Richardson; Nancy discovered she was pregnant with her boyfriend, Kyles‚Äôs, child but she later miscarried after being stabbed. Her latest storylines have seen the character be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and discovering Darren's affair with her best friend, Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn). In the character's early stages, she was portrayed as a less conventional character compared to the rest of the Hollyoaks teenagers. As of 2020, Nancy has been on the show for 15 years, making her one of the longest running characters. Character creation and casting Nancy was created as the younger sister of Becca, who arrives to visit. The character was initially only intended to feature in three episodes. Auditions were held for the role with actress Jessica Fox securing the role. Fox auditioned for the role and was given the part. She began filming the next day for which she said she was \\"completely underprepared\\" for and \\"scared out of [her] witts\\". She was initially contracted for three episodes but on Fox's second day of filming, she was given more scripts and asked to stay on longer which she agreed to, before she was again given more scripts. She has since remained on the serial. Fox extended her contract in January 2012 and predicted that the year would feature Nancy's \\"biggest storyline\\" so far. Character development =Characterisation= On Nancy's personality, Fox described her as different from other Hollyoaks girls, dubbing her the \\"anti- Hollyoaks girl\\". She said that Nancy has \\"always got some kind of bitchy comeback for everyone\\". She explained that Nancy \\"says that you don‚Äôt have to be the skinny blonde or the skinny brunette, you can be the one who does whatever the hell she likes\\". After the character had gone through certain transformations, the actress spoke about these changes saying: \\"Nancy's gone full circle and she's had the chance to become a whole character, rather than just one who has no end of tragedy and no end of silly affairs\\". Fox has said that her character is \\"a control freak. Nancy has very definite ideas of what she wants and what she doesn't\\". She added that Nancy is \\"a bit posh and stiff\\" and \\"uptight\\" but that she can get \\"really wild\\" when she has \\"had a few drinks\\". Fox has described Nancy as \\"a bit of a moral compass for the show. She knows what's right and she's often the voice of that. I think that's a really good role for her, and it's quite an important one. I think it's quite good to have a strong, intelligent woman in the show\\". She added that Nancy \\"has a very short fuse and loses her temper quickly\\". On Nancy, E4's official Hollyoaks website say: \\"they say good things come in small packages and that's definitely the case when it comes to Nancy, the feistiest fun-size female in Hollyoaks. [...] Nancy has been determined to establish herself as a career woman - though she hasn't always been sure what career\\". A Channel 4 official Hollyoaks website states that Nancy is vibrant and eccentric\\" and feisty\\". What's on TV described Nancy as \\"fiercely protective of her quirky appearance\\" and as having \\"a tough personality\\". They added that the character \\"has weathered the numerous tragedies in her life\\". Holy Soap describes the character as \\"cool and independent and a total mess\\". Nancy's hair has dominated her many styles and she has had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's \\"crazy\\" hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': \\"I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when we came out of the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked me if I wanted to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'\\". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was \\"definitely not a good look\\". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a \\"few hair disasters\\", especially the in between stages when she \\"went back to black from red and then to blonde\\". She said that since her character has been through so much she no longer feels it necessary to \\"desperately shock\\" everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has \\"evolved\\" as she has \\"been a Goth, she‚Äôs been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It‚Äôs a bit Duffy, a bit ‚Äô50s-style, and now I‚Äôve got the red hair it gives us more to play with\\". Fox added that \\"one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot\\". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had \\"cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully\\". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be \\"too masculine\\". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it \\"great to be different\\" but felt that it was difficult playing the \\"alternative\\" character of Nancy when her colleagues were such \\"gorgeous, glamourous women\\". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said \\"Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment her slim shape\\". =Introduction and drug abuse= Nancy arrives in the village to visit Becca. Bastian told a reporter from Inside Soap that \\"Becca's flabbergasted when Nancy turns up!\\" The pair have not seen each other for some time and Nancy has changed. Nancy is a punk and more \\"strong-willed\\" than Becca remembers her. The actress added that Nancy is nothing like Becca. Her arrival gives Becca someone to confide in with her relationship with Justin Burton (Chris Fountain). Nancy forms a relationship with former tattoo artist Foz. The relationship sees her becoming dependent on him mainly because he was a hippy and free, which at the time represented everything Nancy stood for. During her relationship with Foz, the character begins abusing drugs. Fox revealed how her character's longing to fit in with people like Foz who were different from the rest of society, ended with her taking drugs to be different from others but the same as the hippy scene. Fox spoke about this saying: \\"I think Nancy's character is very strong, she's opinionated, but if you take all that away she's still very young particularly then, at the time of the drug storyline she was 16 she still wanted desperately to fit in even though she told everyone she didn't. At that particular party she was at she was surrounded by all these people who were traveling, really into their music, they had the life style that Nancy wanted, and she just desperately wanted to fit in at the end of the day, and that's what happens she took LSD and it went horribly wrong\\". =Jake Dean= During Nancy's relationship with Jake Dean, Nancy's character was rapidly transformed due to her abuse at the hands of Jake. Fox told a journalist from OK! that when the relationship begins Jake is \\"very controlling\\" towards Nancy and he takes away \\"all the things that made Nancy Nancy ‚Äì the way she was opinionated and outspoken\\". She explained that during the storyline Nancy acts out of character which she found challenging to portray. She added that Nancy's abuse at the hands of Jake is psychological abuse rather than physical abuse. Sacre explained that Nancy wants to call off the wedding but Jake \\"dismisses her concerns and insists the wedding goes ahead. He's kind of bulldozing his way through it all\\". He added that Jake Nancy still does not feel the wedding is right after he makes the arrangements but Jake still \\"keeps on pushing and pushing and she gives in\\". Sacre said that Nancy regrets marrying Jake as soon as she has gone through with the wedding. Jake \\"ends up trying to force himself on her on their wedding night\\". Sacre commented that in reaction to this Jake \\"plays the victim and tries to blame Nancy for what's happened\\". The actor revealed that while Jake is in \\"a desperate state\\" he accidentally tells Nancy that he made allegations that she was having a sexual relationship with a pupil. Nancy is \\"incensed\\". Fox stated that she and the production team were careful not to have the character return to her previous self, saying: \\"We've tried really hard to make sure that Nancy didn't just snap back into her old self after the whole Jake incident last year. There's always a bit of darkness with her. That's something that really annoys me in soap, when something really dramatic happens to a character and they forget about it a couple of weeks later\\". =Bisexual love triangle= In another storyline Nancy became romantically involved with both Kris Fisher and Ravi Roy, who also begin a relationship unbeknownst to Nancy. Fox said that when series producer Bryan Kirkwood told her of the storyline she was initially pleased as she had always felt that Kris and Nancy \\"would go well together\\" but when he revealed the full details, that Nancy would also be involved with Ravi at the same time she was \\"quite shocked\\". She expanded on this, saying: \\"Nancy's never cheated on anyone in her life because that's not who she is. But Bryan said to me 'we're going to have a lot of fun with this and I want it to be like a Carry on with loads of door-shutting and times when you don't know who's going to get caught'. So that's what we went for in the end\\". Fox explained that upon Nancy discovering that Kris and Ravi have been having a relationship she thought she would \\"be flying in there, fists flailing, but this has completely stumped her. For the first time ever, Nancy has nothing to say. She just bolts\\". She added that Nancy is \\"speechless\\" which is different for her as \\"she's always got a comeback for everyone, but in this case she just doesn't do anything\\". Fox said that Nancy has \\"no right\\" to be angry with Kris and Ravi as they have all been having sex with each other without the other knowing. Nancy, Kris and Ravi decide to carry on having relationships with each other with each other's consent, Fox was shocked when she learned of this development, saying: \\"No words could describe how I felt when I read it for the first time!\\" The actress revealed that Hollyoaks' time slot restricted the characters having a threesome so instead the characters having an open three-way relationship was introduced. Fox explained that when Nancy begins the three-way relationship she soon realises she is not comfortable with it so she decides to end the relationship. She added Nancy wants a relationship with \\"someone who'll love and look after her. Deep down, she wants that security which a conventional relationship brings as she hasn't had that for so long\\". =Darren Osborne= Nancy begins a relationship with Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson). Fox commented that the relationship \\"came out of nowhere\\" but because the writers and audience were \\"charmed\\" it was kept long term. Fox told Laura-Jane Tyler of Inside Soap that she \\"never thought they were going to last, but we just went for it full throttle\\". Fox added that she was initially surprised when she heard the about the pairing. She explained that \\"it was only ever intended to be quite a short-term thing\\". Dawson also said that he was initially surprised when their characters were paired together, adding that the initial scene in which the pair got together was \\"absolutely hilarious. Darren just looked up and there she was!\\" Dawson explained that the two are \\"complete opposites\\" as Darren is a \\"male chauvinist pig\\" while Nancy is a \\"feminist\\" but \\"somewhere in all the madness, they seem to be on the same page\\". He added that the pair bring out the best in each other and \\"work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman\\". Fox commented that the pair would make good parents but have \\"a lot of growing up to do themselves\\", before adding that she hoped Nancy and Darren would stay together for a long time\\" as she enjoyed the pairing. On Darren's feelings for Nancy, Dawson said she has \\"really calmed Darren down. He's totally in love with her\\". He added that the pair share a \\"tempestuous relationship, even if it's also very sweet\\". On Darren's feelings for Nancy, Dawson said: \\"He's besotted with her. He feels she's good for him and that he almost doesn't deserve her. He feels like a bit of a failure and Nancy is this strong woman who's organised and everything Darren isn't\\". Dawson felt that Nancy is the love of Darren's life and that she had helped Darren mature. Dawson said that Darren and Nancy have \\"know each other for a long time\\" and that they \\"work well together\\". On 19 December 2011 Digital Spy announced that a future storyline would see Darren plan the couple's wedding as a surprise for Nancy. Dawson explained that it is initially Darren's idea to have a surprise wedding as he is content with his life and wants a way to \\"show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that\\". Dawson felt that this was not a good idea as Nancy would want a \\"classy\\" wedding which Darren can not afford. He said that when Nancy discovers his plans Darren expects she will be \\"delighted\\" but Nancy is \\"the sort of woman who'd be fussy about her wedding\\" so she may not react how Darren would expect. Fox said that Nancy would \\"be horrified [...] because she is a control freak. [...] I don't know if it's Darren's wisest move, but I think Nancy would also see that he has good intentions\\". Dawson felt that Darren is \\"incredibly excited\\" for the wedding, especially because of the hard work and planning he has put into it. He said that as far as Darren is \\"concerned, it's going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to\\". Dawson added that in his opinion, Nancy and Darren are the \\"perfect match and are incredibly sweet together\\". He expressed that Darren \\"brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order\\" and felt that the couple are \\"destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!\\" To coincide the storyline it was announced Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton would return to the serial with the possibility of causing trouble for Darren's wedding plans. Fox revealed that Margaret would decide to split Nancy and Darren up as she believes Nancy can do better. She said Margaret would be \\"quite vindictive\\" while doing this and she would \\"try to make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren. It's underhand and cruel, because she plays on Nancy's insecurities and self-doubt. Margaret starts making Nancy feel very insecure in the relationship, and she also starts to feel quite unsure about her future in Hollyoaks\\". Fox revealed that Darren's ex-girlfriend, Cindy Cunningham would become involved in the storyline when Margaret begins trying to \\"push\\" Cindy and Darren together. Nancy begins to suspect Darren is having an affair with Cindy which begins because he has \\"been behaving a bit strangely\\" while planning the secret wedding. When Cindy helps Darren with planning the wedding they embrace which is witnessed by Nancy which \\"confirms everything that she thought. To Nancy, it seems that everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair\\". Her portrayer explained that she would have expected Nancy to confront Cindy but Nancy can not \\"bring herself to do it. [...] you see that this relationship has meant more to Nancy than any other. She's deeply, deeply hurt\\". Dawson explained that the storyline is \\"just a case of Nancy getting things misconstrued\\" and that it is not a \\"obvious affair plot\\". Nancy and Darren marry. Fox explained that \\"getting married is important to Nancy. For all her wanting to be alternative and different, she really just wants to be loved\\". Dawson said that Darren is relieved that the wedding goes ahead as he worries that Nancy is \\"too good for him\\". On how marriage will affect the couple Dawson said: \\"the only way it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger\\". Commenting on the couple's future Dawson said that children are \\"definitely something that they both want, as everything's going well [...] Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future\\". Fox said that Nancy's life is going well and she has a \\"got this big family that care about her, having had no-one for so long\\". She added that her character \\"loves Darren to pieces\\" and she wanted to get married and then \\"have babies and be happy. I think that's what she really wants\\". She teased that Nancy may not immediately want children but she may not have a choice in the matter. =Miscarriage and premature birth= Fox revealed that \\"there's some really big, emotional stuff coming up\\" for the couple and that herself and Dawson \\"spent the last three weeks of filming crying non-stop\\". She said that the serial \\"will really explore Darren and Nancy's relationship this year, and I can't wait to see how it all plays out\\". Nancy soon feels that she may be pregnant, Fox said that if Nancy were pregnant \\"It would be great to watch them trying to cope with it\\", adding that the potential scenes would be \\"hilarious\\". Nancy discovers she is pregnant and suffers a pregnancy scare. Fox told an Inside Soap reported that if Nancy suffered a miscarriage the couple's relationship may not survive. Her portrayer explained that Nancy begins to suffer stomach pains and blood loss but believes going to the hospital will solve the problem. Fox said that Nancy is in \\"quite a lot of pain and is really frightened\\" and she \\"knows that there's a real possibility she could lose the baby, but that's too awful for her to contemplate\\". Nancy suffers a miscarriage which Fox said is a \\"really traumatic time\\" for both Nancy and Darren. She said that Nancy feels like she has \\"failed, which is something she doesn't deal with very well\\". The actress added that the miscarraige will \\"be a really difficult thing for her to ever get over\\". Fox revealed that the scenes took \\"three or four weeks\\" to film the \\"quite intense\\" material. She felt that the scripts for the scenes were \\"some of the best scripts I've ever had. The way that it was written just felt really true, and it wasn't hard to conjure up that emotion\\". Speaking on This Morning, Fox said she was stopped in the street by people who praised the storyline as being true to life which she said was \\"overwhelming\\". Dawson felt the storyline was being \\"very true to life\\" as the scenes are \\"what people go through. It's nice that they're holding onto that and it doesn't just end there. It's an ongoing thing like any relationship, so it's just nice to do it justice. The feedback's been great\\". Nancy soon after becomes pregnant. Nancy begins helping her friend, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) who has escaped from prison. Mitzeee was in prison for the stabbing of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has \\"always known her friend was innocent\\" as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying \\"something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined\\". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her \\"really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!\\" Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: \\"They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I think those are all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile\\". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy has a bit of a \\"bad girl\\" in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got \\"more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised\\". Nancy does not tell Darren that she is helping Mitzeee, which Fox told a reporter from What's on TV is because \\"Darren is so focused on the baby that if she told him he'd be really angry. Nancy feels he doesn't understand the relationship she has with Mitzeee and he hasn't been terribly supportive\\". When questioned if Nancy feels her involvement with Mitzeee may place strain on the baby, Fox answered: \\"At the moment she feels incredibly tired, but she's sure that everything's fine and all she needs to do is focus on her friend\\". Darren discovers Nancy is helping Mitzeee, making him \\"absolutely furious\\" as he can not believe Nancy is \\"going against the law, is running around and getting stressed - especially while she's heavily pregnant\\". When urged to put their child first by Darren, Nancy dismisses him as she believes he is \\"just being silly\\". Fox said that \\"Nancy thinks she knows best, as Nancy always does\\", adding that Nancy is \\"a bit like a dog with a bone. If she's decided that she's going to do something, it's very difficult to change her mind\\". While Nancy is with Mitzeee, she gets \\"sudden twinges\\" which she does not worry about until \\"the contractions really start to kick in. She's only 26 weeks' pregnant and she's totally terrified\\". Nancy calls Darren who takes her to hospital where she is \\"doubled over in agony\\". The doctors try giving Nancy medication to stop the contractions which fails. Nancy has an emergency Caesarean and gives birth to a boy who the doctors are unsure if he will \\"make it through the night\\" which Fox said is a \\"terrible time for Nancy and Darren\\". Darren blames Nancy for their babies premature birth, Dawson explained that this is because he believes that Nancy did not \\"take proper care of herself during her pregnancy\\". He said that Nancy seemed to be preoccupied with Mitzeee and \\"wouldn't listen to him when he told her to back off. In his heart of hearts, Darren feels she's responsible for all of this\\". Fox revealed that she researched premature births, reading up on the subject and attending a meeting at the Liverpool Women's Hospital along with a writer for the serial. There, Fox spoke to a midwife who deals specifically with premature babies, which she found \\"really helpful\\". The actress added that although the serial tried to stay true to life there is \\"a bit of artistic licence that goes into the scripts, to make things more dramatic or to let the story flow better\\". On how Nancy would behave as a mother, Fox said: \\"I imagine that she'll be a bit of a neurotic mother, particularly as the baby has arrived so early. I think she'd want to wrap him up in cotton wool and not let him out of her sight\\".

What with Darren‚Äôs cheeky escapades and Nancy‚Äôs no-messing attitude, they‚Äôll make the perfect parents\\". She added that if Nancy is \\"as organised at being a mum as she is at being a journalist, then they will cope brilliantly! We‚Äôre hoping the writers will leave them to be a happy for once and let Nancy have a stress-free pregnancy, but we don‚Äôt fancy their chances\\". Crick's colleague Laura Morgan commented on Nancy going into premature labour saying \\"Our hearts were breaking for the couple as they faced the reality of their situation [...] we‚Äôre keeping our fingers crossed there will be a happy ending to their nightmare\\".

He is described in the Almadel of Solomon as one of the chief angels of the first and fourth chora.Davidson, Gustav. A Dictionary of Angels, including the Fallen Angels.

Iconography Statue of Saint Baraquiel In iconography Barachiel is sometimes shown holding a white rose against the chest, or with rose petals scattered on the clothing particularly the cloak. The scattering of rose petals was to symbolize or represent God's sweet blessings showering down on people. In Roman Catholicism, Barachiel is depicted holding a bread basket or a staff, both of which symbolize the blessings of children that God bestows on parents.http://angels.about.com/od/AngelsReligiousTexts/p/Meet-Archangel- Barachiel.htm Patronage Barachiel's responsibilities are as varied as the blessings for which the archangel is named. Barachiel is also the chief of the guardian angels and it is written that Barachiel may be prayed to for all the benefits which the guardian angel is thought to confer if one is not praying to the guardian angel directly, but as an intercession. He is seen as an official saint in Byzantine Catholic and Eastern Orthodox tradition, in particular a patron of family and married life. http://angels.about.com/od/AngelsReligiousTexts/p/Meet-Archangel- Barachiel.htmHe is also seen as the angel assigned by God to watch over converts (also called \\"adopted children of God\\") to assist them in their lives. http://findingthewaytotheheart.blogspot.com/2010/12/the-holy- archangels-prayers-asking-for.html Barachiel is also traditionally associated with the month of February and the Zodiacal sign Pisces.Sisung, Kelle S., editor. Angels A to Z. New York: Gale Research, Inc. 1996. . He is also sometimes described as being the ruler of the planet Jupiter and the zodiacal sign Scorpio. Biblical texts The Third Book of Enoch describes archangel Barachiel as one of the angels who serve as great and honored angelic princes in heaven, and mentions that Barachiel leads 496,000 other angels. He is considered one of the seraphim class of angels who guard God's throne, as well as the leader of all the guardian angels.http://angels.about.com/od/AngelsReligiousTexts/p/Meet-Archangel- Barachiel.htm Prayers A general prayer to St. Barachiel common in Byzantine Catholic and Orthodox traditions is as follows: O Powerful Archangel, St. Barachiel, filled with heaven‚Äôs glory and splendor, thou art rightly called God‚Äôs benediction. We are God‚Äôs children placed under thy protection and care. We are in the world filled with confusion and demonic influences. Come to our aid as we do not know our left and right; how to relate to Jesus on daily bases; how to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit - Spirit of truth. Let the joy of the Lord be our strength. Hear our supplications (name them). Grant that, through thy loving intercession, we may reach our heavenly home one day. Sustain us and protect us from all harm that we may possess for all eternity the peace and happiness that Jesus has prepared for us in Heaven.

He is the author of investigations into the extreme right-wing (particularly about the National Front militias, which are the object of a parliamentary investigation and caused a separation of the extreme right-wing party), as well as into the Catholic church (Opus Dei, for example). Meyssan's book 9/11: The Big Lie (L'Effroyable imposture) challenges the official account of events of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  Career  In 1994, Meyssan became a staff member of the Radical Party of the Left (PRG), a centrist political organization, and he participates in the campaign of Bernard Tapie (1994 European elections) and Christiane Taubira (2002 presidential elections). In 1994, he founded the Voltaire Network and also created Project Ornicar, associations promoting freedom of expression and thinking, of which he is currently president. From 1996 to 1999, he worked as substitute coordinator of the National Committee of Surveillance against the extreme right, which held weekly meetings with the 45 major political parties, unions and associations belonging to the French left-wing in order to draw up a common response to escalating intolerance. Between 1999 and 2002, Meyssan replaced Emma Bonino in the leading post of the Anti-prohibitionist Radical Coordination, an international organization aiming to decriminalize drug use as a means to cut organized crime's main source of income.  Publication of The Big Lie  In 2002, he published a book on the September 11 terrorist attacks‚Äî9/11: The Big Lie‚Äîin which Meyssan argues that such attacks were organized by a faction of the US military‚Äìindustrial complex in order (1) to impose a non-democratic regime in the United States and (2) to extend US imperialism. The book was translated into 28 languages. It is one of \\"the first wave of book-length conspiracy speculations\\" in France and Germany about 9/11.Peter Knight \\"Outrageous Conspiracy Theories: Popular and Official Responses to 9/11 in Germany and the United States\\" New German Critique, No. 103, Dark Powers: Conspiracies and Conspiracy Theory in History and Literature (Winter, 2008), pp. 165-193 Published by: Duke University Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/27669225 Accessed: 30-01-2018 16:25 UTC His following book was Le Pentagate, a book arguing that the attack against the Pentagon was not carried out by a commercial airliner but a missile. The central thesis of the book is that a Boeing 757 did not hit The Pentagon. This was heavily criticised by other prominent 9/11 Truth Movement members such as Jim Hoffman.Jim Hoffman, The Pentagon No-757-Crash Theory: Booby Trap for 9/11 Skeptics, 9/11 Research blog (first published: 7 October 2004. revised: 15 November 2004). He started a campaign at the United Nations to initiate an international investigation commission to revisit the general consensus regarding the 9/11 attacks, but he was not able to reach his objective. There was little support, except from the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council. 2011 Libyan civil war On 22 August 2011, Meyssan while stuck at the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli, reported live, by voice, to the Russian television network RT (formerly known as Russia Today). He claimed that the Attorney General of the International Criminal Court was lying and that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi had not been taken prisoner. He also claimed that loyalist forces had regained ground. The next day, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi appeared in public, but the loyalists looted the land they had released. At the same time he described that he felt in danger, accusing other CNN and BBC journalists at the hotel of being spies from the CIA and the MI6, who were allegedly giving information on objectives to the NATO and the NTC militias. That same day, Meyssan reported that U.S. agents, disguised as journalists at the Rixos hotel had marked him for assassination. He then stated that the identities of these spies would be released in due course.Thierry Meyssan and Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya under death threat in Tripoli Voltaire Network, Tripoli, Libya. 22 August 2011. Five countries offered protection to Meyssan and Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya in their embassies, but they were unable to reach any of them, because of the heavy fighting around the hotel and the encirclement of some of those embassies by NTC militiashttp://www.silviacattori.net/article1824.html Tripoli: Voltaire Network concerned about the death threats hanging over Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya and Thierry Meyssan Voltaire Network, Tripoli, Libya. 22 August 2011.  Later activities  In November 2005, Meyssan presided over the Axis for Peace 2005 Colloquium, which gathered over 130 participants from 37 nations in order to discuss the international situation and call a people's mobilization in favour of international law and world peace and against the neoconservative trend. Meyssan believes the Beslan massacre was thought out and perpetrated by the CIA, through the terrorist leader Shamil Basayev, who Meyssan insists was a CIA strawman. The purpose of the massacre in Beslan had been, claims Meyssan, an attempt by the USA to gain control of the resources of the Caspian Sea.Thierry Meyssan, \\"Beslan: the mystery clarified one year later,\\" www.voltairenet.org (7 September 2005).

The Moroccan government considers the Polisario Front as a separatist movement given the alleged Moroccan origins of some of its leaders. The Polisario Front argues that according to international organizations, like the United Nations or the African Union, the territory of Western Sahara has the right of self- determination, and that according to those organizations Morocco illegally occupies the parts of Western Sahara under its control. Polisario regards this as a consequence of the vision of a Great Morocco, fuelled in the past by the Istiqlal and Hassan II, and considers itself a national liberation movement aiming at leading the disputed territory to independence under the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The United States, the European Union, the African Union and the United Nations do not recognize the sovereignty of Morocco over Western Sahara. Human rights The Western Sahara conflict has resulted in severe human rights abuses, most notably the aerial bombardments with Napalm and White phosphorus of the Sahrawi refugee camps, the consequently exodus of tens of thousands of Sahrawi civilians from the country, and the forced expropriation and expulsion of tens of thousands of Moroccan civilians by the Algerian government from Algeria in reaction to the Green March as well as violations of human rights and serious breaches of the Geneva convention by the Polisario Front, the Moroccan government and the Algerian government. Both Morocco and the Polisario accuse each other of violating the human rights of the populations under their control, in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara and the Tindouf refugee camps in Algeria, respectively. Morocco and organisations such as France Libert√©s consider Algeria to be directly responsible for any crimes committed on its territory, and accuse the country of having been directly involved in such violations. Morocco has been repeatedly condemned and criticized for its actions in Western Sahara by several international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as: *Amnesty International *Human Rights Watch *World Organization Against Torture *Freedom House *Reporters Without Borders *International Committee of the Red Cross *UN High Commissioner for Human Rights *Derechos Human Rights *Defend International *Front Line Defenders *International Federation of Human Rights *Society for Threatened Peoples *Norwegian Refugee Council *Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights *Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies *Arabic Network for Human Rights Information *Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network Polisario has received criticism from the French organization France Libertes on its treatment of Moroccan prisoners-of-war, and on its general behaviour in the Tindouf refugee camps in reports by the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center. A number of former members of Polisario who have joined Morocco accuse the organisation of abuse of human rights and sequestration of the population in Tindouf During the war (1975‚Äì91), both sides accused each other of targeting civilians. Neither claim has met with support abroad. The USA, EU, AU and UN refused to include the Polisario Front on their lists of terrorist organizations. Polisario Front leaders maintain that they are ideologically opposed to terrorism, as they had condemned terrorist attacks and signed the \\"Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism\\", in the framework of the African Union. Human rights are repressed in the Moroccan-controlled territories of Western Sahara, according to Amnesty International in 2003 and Human Rights Watch in 2004. While the situation has improved since the early 1990s, the political liberalization in Morocco has not had the same effect on Western Sahara according to Amnesty International in 2004., when it comes to having a pro-independence position. There are allegations of police abuse and torture by Polisario-organisations., and suspected dissidents are harassed. The United States State Department reported in 2000 that there were arbitrary arrests of Sahrawis and no organized labor. Prisoners of conscience were kept in squalid conditions according to Polisario-groups. Some Sahrawis also complain of systematic discrimination in favor of Moroccan settlers. The Moroccan response to the demonstrations of 2005 was very aggressive, and provoked international reactions. In a criticised mass trial in December 2005, 14 leading Sahrawi activists were sentenced to prison sentences; many more had previously been detained. Most of these prisoners were later released by royal decree in the spring of 2006, but some have since again been rearrested. According to the US State Department's 2006 report on Morocco \\"The law generally provides for freedom of speech and of the press. The government generally respected these rights in practice, as long as Islam, the monarchy, and territorial integrity (the inclusion of the Western Sahara) were not criticized. Throughout the year several publications tested the boundaries of press freedom.\\" The US State Department's 2005 report on Morocco's attitude towards human rights noted that \\"[i]n 2004 various international human rights groups estimated that 700 persons were imprisoned for advocating Western Saharan independence.\\". Foreign journalists and visiting missions have been prevented from visiting the territory and in some instances deported from it. In 2004, Moroccan newsman Ali Lmrabet was sentenced to heavy fines and ten-year ban on practicing journalism, for referring in an article to the Sahrawis in Tindouf, Algeria, as being \\"refugees\\" rather than \\"sequestered\\" or \\"kidnapped\\", as is the official Moroccan position. Sahrawi human rights organizations have been refused permission to operate in Morocco: the Sahrawi branch of the Moroccan Forum for Truth and Justice (FVJ) was dissolved in 2003, and its members arrested. They were later released in the royal amnesties of 2006, or before that, even if some have since been rearrested again. Presently, several organisations, such as the ASVDH, operate illegally, with activists occasionally subject to arrests and harassment, whereas others, such as the Polisario close AFAPREDESA, are mainly active in exile. Sahrawi activists have tried to compensate for this through extensive use of the Internet, reporting from illegal demonstrations, and documenting police abuse and torture through online pictures and video. Morocco has responded by blockading Internet access to these sites in Morocco and in Western Sahara, prompting accusations of Internet censorship. On 20 December 2005 Reporters Without Borders reported that Morocco has added Anonymizer to its Internet blacklist, days after the association recommended the service to Moroccans and Sahrawis wishing to access the banned Sahrawi sites. \\"These websites, promoting independence for Western Sahara, have been censored since the beginning of December\\" it reports. Human rights in Morocco-controlled Western Sahara The most severe accusations of human rights abuses by the Kingdom of Morocco are the bombings with Napalm and White phosphorus of the improvised refugee camps in Western Sahara in early 1976, killing hundreds of civilians, as well as the fate of hundreds of \\"disappeared\\" Sahrawi civilians sequestered by Moroccan military or police forces, most of them during the Western Sahara War. Other accusations are the torture, repression and imprisonment of Sahrawis who oppose peacefully the Moroccan occupation, the expulsion from the territory of foreign journalist, teachers and NGO members, the discrimination of the Sahrawis on the labor and the spoliation of the natural resources of the territory. On the 15th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, former prisoner, human rights defender and second vice-president of CODESA (Collective of Sahrawi Human Rights Defenders) El Mami Amar Salem denounced that more than 30,000 Sahrawi citizens had been tortured by Moroccan forces since 1975. =The \\"disappeared\\"= In 2010 around 520 Sahrawi civilians remained \\"disappeared\\" by Moroccan forces, according to human rights groups; some estimate that the total number of \\"disappeared\\" could be as high as 1,500. In the past, Morocco denied that any such political prisoners existed, but in 1991 released nearly 200 \\"disappeared\\" prisoners, many of whom had been held in secret detention centers since the mid-1970s. Since then, there have been no further releases of \\"disappeared\\" prisoners. Amnesty International stated in a 1999 report that: . In May 2005, the remains of 43 Sahrawi \\"disappeared\\" were exhumed from secret prisons on the south of Morocco (Kalaat Maguna, Tagunit). They were detained in Western Sahara (Laayoune, Smara) & southern Morocco (Tan-Tan, Assa) in the 1970s & 1980s. In 2008, the head of CORCAS & former leader of the Sahrawi National Union Party, Khelli Henna Ould Rachid declared: :\\"Some Moroccan army officers have made what might be called war crimes against prisoners outside the scope of the war ... Many civilians were launched into space from helicopters or buried alive simply for being Sahrawis\\". The same year (4 January) construction workers uncovered a mass grave with approximately 15 skeletons in Smara, in former military barracks built during the 1970s, the period during which many Sahrawis disappeared or were murdered by Moroccan authorities. Resulting from the \\"Reconciliation tribunals\\" in Morocco in 2005, some graves of political dissidents of Hassan II regime (Sahrawis & Moroccans) were uncovered, although the responsible persons of those crimes have never been judged or their identities revealed. Also, the testimonies of witnesses have not been published yet. In March 2010, a new grave was found by Bou Craa workers on a phosphate mine with 7 corpses, supposedly Sahrawi nomads killed by Moroccan forces during the mid-1970s. =Freedom House= Sahrawi civilian showing his head wounds caused by Moroccan police during a demonstration in Dakhla, 2 March 2011. In late 2005, the international democracy watchdog Freedom House listed the abuses of human rights by Morocco. Those relating to political processes were: controlling elections and not allowing Sahrawis to form political associations (such as labor organizations) or non-governmental organizations. The paper included reports of repressive measures against demonstrators. =Amnesty International= Sahrawi human rights defender Ali Salem Tamek during his imprisonment in Ait Melloun prison, in Agadir, Morocco. 29 August 2005. After repeatedly calling attention to alleged human rights violations in Moroccan- controlled Western Sahara, Amnesty International (AI) received, in April 2006, two detailed responses from the Moroccan Ministry of Justice. The Ministry declared that human rights defenders were not stopped and were not taken into custody because of their opinions, but because of their implication in acts liable to infractions of the law. It stressed that they were guaranteed their full civil liberties and gave precise details concerning the investigations in progress into the allegations of torture relating to Houssein Lidri and Brahim Noumria. In addition, the letter refuted the specific allegations of harassing and intimidation with regard to other demonstrators in the Sahara. Amnesty International responded by claiming that the authorities have not answered the principal concern of the organization regarding the equity of the lawsuits of Sahrawi protestors. For instance, no mention was made in connection with the allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, and allegations that defendants were not authorized to quote witnesses for the defence. In June 2006, Amnesty International released its 2005 report on Morocco and Western Sahara, again citing excessive police force, leading to the death of two demonstrators. In the section: \\"Protests in Western Sahara\\" Amnesty reports: \\"Dozens of people were charged with inciting or participating in violence in the demonstrations. Over 20 were later convicted and some were sentenced to several years in prison. Among those sentenced were seven long-standing human rights defenders who were monitoring and disseminating information on the crackdown by the security forces. Two alleged that they had been tortured during questioning. An eighth human rights defender was detained awaiting trial at the end of the year. All eight were possible prisoners of conscience.\\" =Child recruitment= War Resisters' International, stated in 1998 that Morocco conscripts citizens, including Sahrawis in the Moroccan- controlled parts of Western Sahara, into the army; it was a punishable offence to resist. The WRI also cited sources from 1993 saying that \\"[r]eports indicate that Moroccan authorities in the south have strongly urged under- eighteens to enlist in the armed forces. Fourteen and fifteen-year-old boys in southern Morocco and in the occupied territory of Western Sahara have been allowed to enlist\\", further citing a source from 1994 that \\"there are many human rights abuses against the Sahrawi population.So far there has been no investigation of the conduct of the Moroccan army in this conflict.\\" Conscription for the Moroccan army was abolished in 2006. =Polisario Prisoners of War= In addition to the civilian \\"disappeared\\", the Polisario Front accuses the Moroccan government of refusing to provide information on the Sahrawi prisoners of war, who were captured on the battlefield during the war years (1975‚Äì91). Morocco long denied holding any war prisoners, but in 1996 released 66 Polisario Front POWs, who were then evacuated to the refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria under international supervision. Polisario maintains that 151 POWs are still missing after being captured by the Moroccan Army, and requests that the Moroccan government shall release them or clarify their fate. Morocco claims it no longer holds any prisoners of war. =Expulsion of Christian foreign workers= Morocco has occasionally expelled small numbers of missionary groups, many funded by U.S. evangelical churches, in Morocco and in the Western Sahara parts that it controls. But in March 2010, aid groups and Western countries diplomats denounced that only in that month 70 Christian foreign aid workers were expelled without any trial. Some of them were from USA, New Zealand, Netherlands and United Kingdom, causing the protest of some ambassadors. While the Moroccan government accused them of trying to convert children to Christianity, and of proselytism, the Christian groups claim that the government was trying to restrict their work at the \\"Village of Hope\\" children's home, for abandoned and orphaned children. Another case was the deportation from El Aaiun of the Spanish teacher Sara Domene. She had been working as a Spanish teacher since 2007. The Moroccan governor of the El Aaiun province sent an expulsion note to the Spanish embassy in Rabat, accusing her \\"being a serious threat to the public order and her expulsion is imperative to safeguard public order\\", in other words, an accusation of proselytism. Sara stated that despite being Evangelic, she is a philologist, and that she exclusively taught Spanish language classes, using the money she earned for a centre for handicapped persons. Sara was expelled 48 hours after she was given notice. = Status at 2010= In October 2006, a secret report by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees leaked to the media by the Norwegian Support Committee for Western SaharaForwarded by Norwegian Support Committee for Western Sahara report by detailing the deteriorating condition of human rights in the occupied territory of Western Sahara. The report details several eyewitness testimonies regarding violence associated with the Independence Intifada, particularly of the Moroccan police against peaceful demonstrators. In March 2010, the Sahrawi human rights activist Rachid Sghir was beaten by Moroccan policemen after an interview with the BBC. On 28 August, Moroccan police arrested 11 Spanish activists, who were demonstrating for independence for the disputed territory in El Aaiun. They claimed that the police had beat them, releasing a photo of one of the wounded. In September 2010, a delegation comprising 70 Sahrawis from the Moroccan-controlled part of Western Sahara participate in the International Symposium \\"The right of peoples to resist: the case of Sahrawi people\\" in Algiers. On their return to El Aaiun airport, the group decided flying in three different groups, accompanied with international observers and journalists. The first group entered without difficulties, but some individuals of the second group were beaten by the police. The third group joined the rest in a house in El Aaiun, surrounded by the police, and finally held a sit in protest in the street, with their mouths taped-up. In October, thousands of Sahrawis fled from El Aaiun and other towns to the outskirts of Lemseid oasis (Gdeim Izik), raising up a campament of thousands of \\"jaimas\\" (Sahrawi tents) called the \\"Dignity camp\\", in the biggest Sahrawi mobilization since the Spanish retreat. They protest for the discrimination of Sahrawis in labor and for the exploitation of the natural resources of Western Sahara by Morocco. The protest, that started with a few jaimas on 9 October, grew up to more than 10,000 persons on 21 October. Other campaments were erected in the outskirts of Bojador, Smara and El Aaiun, but were disbanded by Moroccan police. The \\"Gdeim Izik\\" campament was surrounded by troops of the Moroccan Army and policemen, who made a blockage of water, food and medicines to the camp. On 24 October, a SUV that was trying to enter the camp was machine-gunned by Moroccan soldiers, killing Elgarhi Nayem, a 14-year-old Sahrawi boy, and wounding the other five passengers. The Moroccan Interior ministry claimed that the SUV was gunned after shots rang out of the vehicle, which was denied by their families. According to Sahrawi sources, Elgarhi was buried in secret by the Moroccan authorities, without autopsy or the consent of his family. By that days, the camp had grow to more than 20,000 inhabitants. The Moroccan Army had encircled the camp with a wall of sand and stones, controlling the only access to the camp. On 31 October, Tiago Viera (president of the World Federation of Democratic Youth) was expelled from El Aaiun airport, first to Casablanca and then returned to Lisbon, for alleged \\"irregularities\\" when he was trying to visit the camp. Also that day, eight Spanish activists that also tried to reach Gdeim Izik were retained by Moroccan police on a boat in the port of El Aaiun, when they were confronted by a crowd of Moroccans who make death-threats on them. Police stated that they can't guarantee their safety, and denied them entering the territory, so they had to return to Las Palmas. On 6 November, three Spanish regional MP's that tried to visit the \\"Dignity camp\\" were retained in Casablanca and expelled to Spain the next day without any explanation. Human rights in Polisario-controlled refugee camps Sahrawi refugee camp of Awserd, in Tindouf Province, Algeria. The most severe accusations of human rights abuses by the Polisario Front have been about the detention, killing and the abusive treatment of Moroccan prisoners of war from the late 70s to 2006. Other accusations were that some of the population are kept in the Tindouf refugee camps against their will and did not enjoy freedom of expression. Moroccan newspapers have aired reports of demonstrations being suppressed violently by Polisario forces in the Tindouf camps, but these reports have not been confirmed by international media or human rights organizations. Several international and Spanish human rights and aid organizations are active in the camps on a permanent basis, and contest the Moroccan allegations; there are several people and organizations that claim the Tindouf camps are a model for running refugee camps democratically. In November 2012, the Representative of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Algeria, Mr. Ralf Gruenert stated: ‚ÄúWe have not seen cases of torture in the Saharawi refugee camps‚Äù. In April 2010, the Sahrawi government called on the UN to supervise Human rights in the liberated territories (Free Zone) and refugee camps, hoping that Morocco would do the same. =Moroccan Prisoners of War= Until 1997, Morocco refused to recognize the soldiers captured by the Polisario as POWs, even rejecting their repatriation to their homeland, as it happened with the first groups, liberated unilaterally and unconditionally by the Polisario Front in 1984 and 1989 (by demand of the Italian government of Ciriaco de Mita). On 19 November 1995, the first group of Moroccan soldiers were repatriated to Morocco by mediation of the ICRC, Argentina and the United States. In April 1997, another group of 84 prisoners were released, followed by around 191 more released for the Ramadan festivities on 23 November 1999. Again, Morocco refused to repatriate the soldiers, allegedly because that would mean recognizing that Morocco was at war against the Polisario. Finally on 26 February 2000, a groups of 186 prisoners were repatriated to the Inezgane military base, in Agadir, and another 201 were liberated and repatriated on 13 December 2000. On 17 January 2002, another 115 POW's were released and repatriated, by request of the Spanish government of Jose Maria Aznar. 100 POW's were released on 17 June 2002, by request of the German government of Gerhard Schr√∂der, and were repatriated to Agadir on 7 July 2002. On 10 February 2003, the Polisario liberated 100 POW's on request from the Spanish government. In April 2003, the France Libert√©s foundation led an international mission of inquiry on the conditions of detention of Moroccan prisoners of war long held by the Polisario Front in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Algeria and in the Liberated Territories of Western Sahara. The prisoners (under Red Cross supervision since the 1980s) had been held since the end of hostilities, awaiting the conclusion of a formal peace treaty, but as the cease-fire dragged on over a decade, many prisoners had at this time been held between 15 and 20 years, making them the longest-serving POWs in the world. Polisario had begun releasing a few hundred prisoners at 1984, and continued with that liberations during the 1990s and 2000s, in what were referred by countries like USA, Italy, Ireland, Libya, Qatar or Spain as \\"humanitarian gestures\\", but its refusal to release the last prisoners remained under criticism from the United Nations. In its report, the French foundation produced detailed accusations of torture, forced labour, arbitrary detentions and summary executions of captured soldiers, and claimed that these and other systematic abuses had evaded the Red Cross. Most of the crimes had allegedly been committed in the 1980s, but some were of a later date. The foundation, which supports Sahrawi self-determination and had worked in the camps before, decided to suspend \\"its interventions in the Saharawi refugee camps of Tindouf where the forced labour of the POWs has been going on for the past 28 years\\". The report also accused Algeria of direct involvement in crimes against the POWs, and overall responsibility for their situation. On 14 August 2003, 243 Moroccan POW's were released and repatriated, and another 300 POW's were released on 7 November 2003, by the mediation of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, through the GIFCA. On 21 June 2004, another group of 100 prisoners of war was liberated, by a previous request from the Irish government of Bertie Ahern. They were repatriated by the ICRC on 23 June. The Polisario Front finally released the last 404 POWs on 18 August 2005. =Freedom of movement= In a report published in 2003 Amnesty International concluded that \\"Freedom of expression, association and movement continued to be restricted in the camps controlled by the Polisario Front, near Tindouf in southwestern Algeria. Those responsible for human rights abuses in the camps in previous years continued to enjoy impunity.\\". However, in its 2006 update of the annual report, the references to a lack of basic freedoms had been removed. In 2005 the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants stated: \\"The Algerian Government allowed the rebel group, Polisario, to confine nearly a hundred thousand refugees from the disputed Western Sahara to four camps in desolate areas outside Tindouf military zone near the Moroccan border 'for political and military, rather than humanitarian, reasons,' according to one observer. According to Amnesty International, \\"This group of refugees does not enjoy the right to freedom of movement in Algeria. [...] Those refugees who manage to leave the refugee camps without being authorized to do so are often arrested by the Algerian military and returned to the Polisario authorities, with whom they cooperate closely on matters of security.' Polisario checkpoints surrounded the camps, the Algerian military guarded entry into Tindouf, and police operated checkpoints throughout the country.\\" The main concern of most human rights organizations seems to be the refugees' problems of basic subsistence, living on a meager diet of foreign aid. Human Rights Watch carried out an extensive research mission in the region in 1995, visiting Morocco, Western Sahara and the Tindouf refugees. Its conclusion on the human rights situation for the Sahrawis in Tindouf was that \\"we found conditions to be satisfactory, taking into account the difficulties posed by the climate and desolate location\\". In 1997 and 1999 respectively, the Canadian Lawyers Association for International Human Rights performed two investigative missions to Western Sahara, the first focused on the Tindouf refugee camps, and the second on conditions in Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara. The conclusion of the Tindouf mission states that \\"the refugee camps in Algeria are highly organized and provide more than just the most basic needs to their inhabitants\\" and that \\"It appears that a significant effort is being made to ensure that the population is well- educated and that they participate in the governance of the camps. =Cuba students programme= Polisario is regularly accused by Morocco of deporting Sahrawi children by groups of thousands to Cuba for Communist indoctrination, something which has been supported by alleged former Tindouf refugees now living in Morocco, and former Cuban government officials. This would be considered a case of forcible family separation. Morocco has also alleged that the Polisario exports Sahrawi minors to Cuba in order to force them into child prostitution and to train them as child soldiers. Polisario which was founded on a left-wing ideology, responds that the children in Cuba, numbering tens or hundreds rather than thousands, are students at Cuban universities, and are there of their own free will under a UNHCR-sponsored student exchange program. It regards the Moroccan accusations as a smear campaign aimed at cutting off access to education for Sahrawi refugees. While there exists primary education, there are no universities in the refugee camps, and so Sahrawis have to go abroad to study. Similar programmes exist for Sahrawi students in cooperation with universities in Algeria, Spain and Italy, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic has repeatedly pleaded for more countries to accommodate Sahrawi students. The UNHCR, which oversees the program, has twice investigated the Moroccan claims. In its 2003 report, after having interviewed all 252 Sahrawi students in Cuba, it states that it was the children's own personal will to continue taking advantage of the opportunity to study in Cuba. In 2005, the UNHCR again examined the issue, after continued Moroccan allegations. The number of students was now down to 143, and the UNHCR program was not expected to be renewed after the graduation of those students. The report states that many of the Saharan refugee children have availed themselves of scholarships offered within the framework of bilateral relations between the refugee leadership and various countries. The report suggests that this scholarship programme meets the standards of treatment and care required by the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, especially in: * Protection of the minors from all forms of discrimination while in Cuba, they enjoy equal educational opportunities as well as slightly more advantageous treatment in terms of material and health support provided in Cuban schools. * Fully respect and guaranty of the rights of the students, in regard to health, nutrition, culture, personal liberty and security. * Children are not subjected to any form of abuse or exploitation of any type whatsoever. This also covers military recruitment and training and child labour activities that would qualify as exploitative as defined by the CRC. * All information gathered during the mission affirms the voluntary nature of participation in the programme of the children, the direct role of the parents in determining whether their child would participate, and the opportunity for the children who do not wish to continue the programme, to abandon it and return home. =Child recruitment= According to a 1998 report by War Resisters International, \\"during the guerrilla war\\" ‚Äì i.e. between 1975 and 1991 ‚Äì \\"Polisario recruitment formed an integral part of the education programme. At the age of 12, children were either integrated into the \\"National School of 12 October\\" which prepares the political and military cadres, or they have been sent abroad to Algeria, Cuba and Libya to receive military training as well as regular schooling. At conscription age (17) they returned from abroad to be incorporated into Polisario's armed forces. They received more specialised training in engineering, radio, artillery, mechanics and desert warfare. At nineteen they became combatants.\\" See also *AFAPREDESA *Ali Salem Tamek *Aminatou Haidar *ASVDH *BIRDHSO *Brahim Dahane *History of Western Sahara *Human rights in Morocco *Internet censorship and surveillance in Western Sahara *Mohamed Daddach *Mohamed Elmoutaoikil *Tazmamart References External links *H.R.W. world report 2010: Morocco & Western Sahara *Amnesty International: Morocco/Western Sahara 2006 Report *Freedom House: Western Sahara 2010 Report *Human Rights Watch: Morocco ‚Äì Summary page for Morocco/Western Sahara *IFEX: Morocco Puts Squeeze on Western Sahara News ‚Äì IFEX *UNHCR Western Sahara page *Human Rights Watch: Keeping It Secret ‚Äì 1995 investigative mission to Western Sahara and Tindouf. *R.S.F. ‚Äì Morocco ‚Äì Annual report 2006 *R.S.F. ‚Äì Morocco ‚Äì 2005 annual report *R.S.F. ‚Äì Morocco ‚Äì Annual Report 2002 *N.R.C.

Whann. At the beginning of the American Civil War she was taken into service by the Confederate Navy as CSS General Sterling Price. On 6 June 1862, she was sunk at the Battle of Memphis. She was raised and repaired by the Union army, and on 16 June 1862 was moved into Union service as USS General Price and served until the end of the war. (Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships 1968 p525)  CSS General Sterling Price  CSS General Sterling Price, often referred to as General Price or Price, was built as Laurent Millaudon, (or L. Millandon or Milledon) at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1856. She was acquired for Confederate service and fitted out at New Orleans, Louisiana, for the River Defense Fleet (See DANFS appendix II) and was renamed after the Confederate general Sterling Price. On 25 January 1862, Captain Montgomery began to convert her into a cottonclad ram by placing a 4-inch oak sheath with a 1-inch iron covering on her bow, and by installing double pine bulkheads filled with compressed cotton bales. (This evidently increased her displacement from the 483 tons specified for the Laurent Millaudon to the 633 tons specified for the General Price.) On 25 March, General Price commanded by Captain J. H. Townsend, sailed from New Orleans to Memphis, Tennessee, where she stayed until 10 April having her ironwork completed. She was then sent to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, where she operated in defense of the river approaches to Memphis. On 10 May 1862, off Fort Pillow, General Price under First Officer J. E. Henthorne (or Harthorne), in company with seven other vessels under Captain Montgomery attacked the ironclad gunboats of the Union Mississippi River Squadron. In the action of Plum Point Bend, which followed, the Confederate ram CSS General Bragg struck halting her retreat. This allowed General Price to violently ram the Federal gunboat, taking away her rudder, stern post, and a large piece of her stern, decisively disabling her. At the same time General Price's well directed fire silenced Federal Mortar boat No. 16, which was being guarded by Cincinnati. General Price was heavily hit in this action. Her upper works were severely damaged, and she was struck by a 128-pound shell which cut off her supply pipes and caused a dangerous leak. Destruction of the Confederate force at the Battle of Memphis. CSS General Sterling Price is the ship directly behind the bow of the closest ship (?) The Confederates quickly repaired General Price and later she participated with Montgomery‚Äôs force in holding off Federal vessels until Fort Pillow was successfully evacuated on 1 June. The Confederate vessels then fell back on Memphis to take coal. Following the Federal capture of Fort Pillow, Flag Officer Charles H. Davis USN, commanding the Mississippi River Squadron, pressed on without delay and appeared off Memphis with a superior force on 6 June. Montgomery, unable to retreat to Vicksburg, Mississippi because of his shortage of fuel, and unwilling to destroy his boats, determined to fight against heavy odds. In the ensuing Battle of Memphis, General Price charged the Federal ram but instead collided with the Confederate ram , also attacking Monarch. General Price lost her wheel and was disabled. While the two Confederate vessels were entangled, Federal rams attacked them mercilessly. General Price collided with the Federal ram under Col. Charles Ellet, Jr., commander of the United States Ram Fleet. As Queen of the West captured her crew, General Price sank slowly onto a sand bar. She was later raised by the Union army and taken into Federal service.  USS General Price  USS General Price was a cottonclad river ram and gunboat in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. She was formerly a Confederate ram named CSS General Sterling Price that was sunk and captured during the battle of Memphis on 6 June 1862 by Union naval forces under Flag Officer Charles H. Davis. After the Union victory, she was raised by the Union army and taken to Cairo, Illinois for repairs. She was moved into the Union service under Lt. LeRoy Fitch on 16 June 1862 and was moved to Cairo for repairs. The ram was formally transferred to the Navy by Quartermaster H. A. Wise at Cairo on 30 September 1862. Although at that time she was renamed USS General Price, she continued to be referred to as General Sterling Price in Union dispatches. Lithograph of the Mississippi River Squadron running the Confederate blockade at Vicksburg on 16 April 1863. The lead ship is the flagship with a coal tender, followed by with General Price lashed to her starboard (right) side. Completing repairs and conversion at Cairo on 11 March 1863, General Price departed for duty with the Mississippi River Squadron, arriving at Black Bayou a few days later, to join in the Union's Vicksburg campaign. The commander of the squadron, Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter was at that time attempting to move up the shallow and overgrown Steele's Bayou on the Mississippi river in a move to cut off Vicksburg, Mississippi from the rear, and General Price joined the expedition. After several days of slow and difficult progress, harassed by Confederate troops, the gunboats were forced to withdraw on 22 March 1863. General Ulysses S. Grant and Admiral Porter then conceived a plan to attack Vicksburg from the south. This would require the Mississippi squadron to slip past the Confederate blockade of the river at Vicksburg in order to defend and transport Grant's army across the Mississippi south of the city. As a member of Admiral Porter's flotilla, General Price ran the Confederate blockade at Vicksburg on 16 April 1863. Lashed to the starboard side of the ironclad during the run, she suffered little damage, and arrived safely at New Carthage, Louisiana early the next day with the rest of the fleet. Porter was then in a position to assault Grand Gulf, Mississippi, and, during the heavy engagement with the batteries there on 29 April and 3 May 1863, General Price, under the command of Commander Selim E. Woodworth, carried troops across the river and conveyed transports under fire. The Confederacy was forced to evacuate this vital point on the river, and the fate of Vicksburg was sealed. General Price departed Grand Gulf for the Red River on 3 May and took part in the capture of Alexandria, Louisiana, and assisted in the partial destruction of Fort De Russy, Louisiana between 3 May and 17 May. During this period, General Price acted briefly as Admiral Porter's flagship, and on 10 May she was sent on a reconnaissance up the Black River, where she engaged strong Confederate batteries at Harrisonburg, Louisiana. On 22 June 1863 the Sterling price received 8 replacements to augment the 12 aboard that were fit for duty, the remainder of the crew being ill. As Union pressure against Vicksburg mounted, General Price played a major part in the continuing bombardment of the city and in gunfire support of the Union troops until the Confederacy's river stronghold finally surrendered on 4 July. She was at Bayou Sara, Louisiana below Vicksburg on 7 July 1863 and was in Memphis on 16 July and left there for Cairo and much-needed repairs, which were not completed until about 19 November. General Price rejoined the squadron at Memphis on 2 December 1863 and soon became part of Rear Admiral Porter's planned expedition up the Red River. Before joining Porter, she accidentally rammed on 8 March 1864 after a confusion in whistle signals, causing the latter ship to sink quickly as a total loss. Accompanying the Red River expedition as far as Alexandria, Louisiana, General Price returned to the mouth of the river on 6 April convoying transports. She then took up regular cruising station on the lower Mississippi River, protecting transports, landing reconnaissance parties, and keeping the river free from Confederate guerrillas. While on this duty, she engaged a Confederate battery off Tunic Bend, Louisiana on 19 May forced it to withdraw, and landed a shore party which burned the Confederate headquarters. General Price continued her patrol duties between New Orleans, Louisiana and Donaldsonville, Louisiana until the end of the war. She decommissioned at Mound City, Illinois on 24 July 1865 and was sold on 3 October 1866 to W. H. Harrison.

They recorded the self-produced 2-track MCD Garzweiler II which was published as an exclusive W√≥d-V√°n release and limited to one copy.Ver√∂ffentlichungen, accessed on 19 November 2012. After the recordings, Chaos left the band in March 2000. The same month, Nagelfar signed a contract for two albums Ars Metalli from Frankfurt (Oder). The three remaining members recorded their third album, Virus West, in June 2000, again at the Stage-One-Studio. It was followed by a contribution to a limited split EP with Bluttaufe released in autumn 2000 via Christhunt Productions. Virus West was released in summer 2001. As the band could not find a suitable bass player, they decided to continue with the remaining lineup and hired Gnarl from the band Graupel as a constant session bassist for live performances. In April 2002, Nagelfar disbanded, a decision that surprised the scene. Years later, Meilenwald explained that Zorn had told Zingultus and him that he lacked the energy and motivation he would have needed for Nagelfar, and Zorn and Meilenwald had decided that the band would not exist without one of them. Nagelfar refuse any offers for reunion concerts. Nagelfar are often referred to as an important or legendary band. Legacy journalist Johannes Paul K√∂hler wrote they have achieved \\"world fame\\". Rock Hard journalist Wolf-R√ºdiger M√ºhlmann called them the \\"kings of the Westwall\\", \\"legendary protagonists\\" and \\"by far the most important German black metal band of the so-called second generation\\" whose three albums \\"let the scene [‚Ä¶] explode\\". He called their debut album \\"the most important German black metal album\\", placed on rank 16 of 25 on the magazine's list Die 25 wichtigsten Black-Metal-Alben aller Zeiten ('the 25 most important black metal albums of all times').Wolf-R√ºdiger M√ºhlmann: Nagelfar. H√ºnengrab im Herbst. In: Rock Hard, no. 269, October 2009, p. 95. Their two following albums were featured on the magazine's list 250 Black-Metal-Alben, die man kennen sollte ('250 black metal albums you should know').250 Black-Metal-Alben, die man kennen sollte. In: Rock Hard, no. 269, October 2009, p. 75. After the band's breakup, drummer Alexander von Meilenwald went on to form the one-man band The Ruins of Beverast and became the drummer of Heemat and a session member of Kermania (whose leader Weigand is influenced by early Nagelfar) and Truppensturm. He, Zingultus and Hackelnberg founded the W√≤d-V√°n, a group of black metal fans mainly (but not exclusively) from the region around Aachen. Zingultus also plays in the bands Graupel and Graven. Zorn formed Simple Existenz.  Musical style  In 2002, when asked about the band's influences, Alexander von Meilenwald once replied that comparisons with diverse Scandinavian bands could \\"(unfortunately) not be denied\\", but that he could not tell what bands influence him when writing songs, or if any do, and another time mentioned the early releases of Burzum, Darkthrone, Emperor, Marduk and Immortal. In a 2009 interview, he mentioned the early Scandinavian pioneers as an undeniable influence in the beginning. Jander's vocals were influenced by Burzum, whom he calls his most important influence, and whom all early band members were fascinated by according to Meilenwald. Meilenwald mentioned that the first Srontgorrth chapter was influenced by Enslaved's \\"Slaget i skogen bortenfor\\". But he believes the band already distanced themselves from that on H√ºnengrab im Herbst; the album \\"did not sound as black metal did at that time\\". On their debut album, Nagelfar combined Northern black metal influences with their own rhythmicity and influences from their Teutonic thrash metal background. The vocals were party \\"crazily screamed\\", partly clean and \\"heroically sung\\". The production by Andy Classen, who had never worked with black metal bands before, gave them \\"a brutal yet 'true' sound\\". The production, which was \\"extremely fat and punchy for black metal conditions\\", is considered \\"an important building stone for the success of this album\\". After their first album, the band took another approach to their music and experimented with industrial elements on Srontgorrth. Virus West is more inspired by traditional black metal than the first two albums, except the production.NAGELFAR. E-Mail Interview mit Alexander von Meilenwald , accessed on 19 November 2012. Meilenwald \\"think[s] 'Virus West' already indicated that Nagelfar were departing from the shores of all-too dreamy, melodic and 'beautiful' Black Metal. The development to the point of founding The Ruins Of Beverast merely strengthened me in my decision to create music of immense gloom and trepidation, surreal and dark.\\"Sargon the Terrible: The Ruins of Beverast Interview, 18 June 2007, accessed on 19 November 2012.  Lyrics and ideology  Naglfar took their name from the ship Naglfar from Norse mythology but used its German spelling because they were a German band and used the Pagan symbols \\"more related to (Western) German history\\". Despite the Pagan lyrics, and although \\"[i]t was Euronymous' dogma that Black Metal necessarily had to have a satanic background\\" and \\"Nagelfar has never been a satanic band\\",Johu: The Ruins of Beverast - \\"Perhaps I'm all and nothing, probably I am not interested at all...\\" , 9 February 2010, accessed on 19 November 2012. they always considered themselves \\"pure black metal in every aspect\\" and not as a pagan metal band. The band considered some statements of the black metal scene hilarious and distanced themselves from them, which earned them respect by some and hatred by others and let \\"to bizarre, ambivalent insults [‚Ä¶]. We were dirty punks for some, dirty fascists for others.\\" The debut album's lyrics dealt with mythology and the depths of the human soul. According to Legacy journalist Johannes Paul K√∂hler, the second album, Srontgorrth, dealt with the total solar eclipse in 1999, while Meilenwald explained it as the fictional story of an individual freed from the prison of the unconscious and striving to reclaim his past, understand the present and look into the future. While K√∂hler wrote that with vocalist Zingultus, the band moved away from the Pagan lyrics, Meilenwald wrote that the mythological aspects had almost completely disappeared on Srontgorrth and were more important to Virus West again. The third album's cover displays the Westwall, which, according to Alexander von Meilenwald, is not supposed to be interpreted politically but \\"is the dark side of the Western German landscape and supposed to support the musical scenario. 'Virus West' is a pathogen coming from the west‚Äîthat's us.\\" According to Meilenwald, most people \\"may have realised by now that the political content in black metal contradicts the original idea and has a weak ideological fundament\\". He called politics a \\"mixture of lies, hunger for power and megalomania\\". The band considered it to be important to remain apolitical; Zorn called radical politics in music annoying but added he does not care about political beliefs that are kept out of the music.

O. Matthiessen and Kenneth Murdock, First edition 1947 The Notebooks of Henry James are private notes made by the American-British novelist and critic. Usually the notes are of a professional nature and concern ideas for possible or ongoing fictions, but there are a number of personal notes as well. James made entries in the Notebooks throughout most of his career.  Publication history  The Notebooks weren't published until 1947, when they appeared in a heavily annotated edition compiled by F. O. Matthiessen and Kenneth Murdock. The editors pointed out notebook entries that eventually turned into finished works by James, and then went beyond that simple editorial function to discuss and evaluate the works themselves. Some objected to such critical commentary, while others accepted it as the editors' opinion and nothing more. In 1987 Leon Edel and Lyall Powers published another edition of the Notebooks that eliminated critical commentary on James' finished works, and added substantial new material from other, less formal notes written by James. The new edition also cleared up some obscure references to people mentioned in the Notebooks.  Notebook contents  For those interested in the planning and writing of fictional narratives, the Notebooks are of substantial value. They show James thinking through various possibilities for character and plot development in his fictions, as well as their overall structure and length. James himself seems to have referred to the Notebooks frequently when he wrote the prefaces to the New York Edition (1907-1909) of his fiction. Occasionally the Notebooks feature encouraging comments by James to himself. A famous example is his brief but emotional note after the failure of his play, Guy Domville. The later Edel-Powers edition includes many more personal notes. Though sometimes trivial, this additional material gives some insight into James' everyday schedule, his wide circle of friends and acquaintances, and even his financial affairs.

It is located three nautical miles (6 km) northeast of the central business district of Glens Falls, in the town of Queensbury. This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. The airport is named in honor of Floyd Bennett. It was formerly known as Warren County Airport. The annual Adirondack Balloon Festival is held at this airport. History  From 1918 to 1946, the county's only airport, Floyd Bennett Field, was located on what are now the grounds of Queensbury High School. In 1941, ground was broken a few miles east at what is now the current site of the airport. The airport has been served commercially by Colonial Airlines (1940s), Eastern Air Lines (1950s), Mohawk Airlines (1950s‚Äì1970s), Allegheny Airlines (1970s), and Air North (1960s‚Äì1980s).  Facilities and aircraft  Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport covers an area of 628 acres (254 ha) at an elevation of 328 feet (100 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 1/19 is 5,000 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m) and 12/30 is 3,999 by 100 feet (1,219 x 30 m). The north-facing runway 1 is equipped with an instrument landing system and a medium intensity approach lighting system with runway alignment lights. GPS-based instrument approaches are available to all four runway ends. A VORTAC is located at the field and during the 1990s and earlier was used as the basis for IFR approaches to the main runway. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2011, the airport had 33,015 aircraft operations, an average of 90 per day: 85% general aviation, 12% air taxi, and 3% military. At that time there were 50 aircraft based at this airport: 92% single-engine, 4% jet, 2% multi-engine, and 2% helicopter.  Incidents  On November 19, 1969, Mohawk Airlines Flight 411 crashed into Pilot Knob Mountain while attempting to land at the conclusion of a flight from Albany. All 14 passengers and crew were killed in the accident. On June 21, 1983, a Beechcraft BE-58 landed without deploying the landing gear after a training flight around the airport. The accident was blamed on the pilot's failure to deploy the landing gear. No injuries were reported, however, the plane was destroyed. On June 30, 1984, an Aeronca 11AC collided with a rock ledge approximately 1/4 of a mile north of runway 19 during takeoff. The pilot of the aircraft was killed in the incident. On September 27, 2002, a charter jet operated by Heartland Aviation Inc. suffered a landing gear failure during a hard landing on runway 1. The hard landing was attributed to the pilot's efforts to avoid deer that had wandered onto the runway. There were no injuries or fatalities. On May 15, 2010, a 1999 American Champion crashed on takeoff from runway 19. The crash was blamed on a large wind gust, which caused the pilot to lose control of the plane and crash into a ditch. No injures or fatalities resulted from the crash. On July 2, 2011, a Piper Cherokee lost electrical power while on final approach into the airfield. As a result, the pilot was unable to deploy the plane's landing gear. The pilot was uninjured. On July 16, 2012, a single engine Cessna 208 was landing on runway 19 when it blew a tire, causing the plane to flip multiple times. The pilot suffered a hand laceration and the plane was destroyed.

They were formed in 1996 by Georgia businessman Billy Ballew.  Fasscore Motorsports  In 2003, Ballew began running a second truck under the name Fasscore Motorsports with Christopher Beckington as the owner. Rich Bickle finished eighth in its first race, followed by Andy Houston the next race. After Lance Hooper started their next event, Kenny Hendrick drove for the rest of the season, providing a best finish of 31st. The team disbanded at the end of the season. Truck No. 15 history Krisiloff's 2006 truck qualifying at Texas The 15 truck of Billy Ballew Motorsports had been its original truck since the 1996 season. Originally based in Georgia, the team debuted at Bristol Motor Speedway with Mark Gibson driving the Ford F-150 with sponsorship from Isaac Leasco. In their first race, Ballew Motorsports finished 12th, and followed it up with a ninth-place run at their next race at The Milwaukee Mile. After running the next five races with L.C. Smith Sales sponsorship, Gibson stepped out of the ride and was replaced by Bobby Gill. Gill brought Nashville Auto Auction sponsorship, and had two eleventh-place runs before Rick Johnson finished out the season. His best finish was a fifteenth at Phoenix International Raceway. In 1997, Mike Cope was hired to run a limited schedule with Penrose Meat Snacks sponsorship. They ran six races that year, with a best finish of 12th coming at Louisville. After taking nearly a year off, the team returned at Milwaukee in 1998. Scott Hansen qualified the Oshkosh Trucks/Neihus entry eighth but finished twenty-fourth. Bickle would then drive in two races later that season with Turbine Solutions sponsorship, finishing in the top-five in both races. The team's first start in 1999 came at Martinsville, where Joe Ruttman finished thirteenth in the Ortho truck. Their next start came late in the season at Las Vegas Motor Speedway when Cope returned and finished thirtieth with sponsorship from Manheim Auctions. The team gained notoriety in 2000 when their truck, sponsored by Line-X and driven by former Daytona 500 winner Geoffrey Bodine was involved in a fiery crash in the tri-oval at Daytona International Speedway. Bodine survived, and for the next three weeks, his son Barry drove the truck, and had two top-twenty finishes. Bobby Gill then returned for two races, but he did not finish higher than 32nd. At Chicago Motor Speedway, the briefly switched to the No. 32 to accommodate Anthony Lazzaro, who finished 22nd in the race. For 2001, the team had originally with African-American driver Preston Tutt, but the deal fell through.Petree shuffles Nemechek's staff Their first race of the year came at Martinsville Speedway, Jon Wood made his first start in the Mark Warner-sponsored truck, and finished 31st. Derek Gilcrist then drove at Darlington Raceway, and finished seventeenth, followed later by Rick Beebe finishing 30th at Kansas Speedway in the Trailside RV entry. Ballew's No. 15 changed its name to Countryman-Ballew Motorsports, the team improved its standings from 23rd to 14th would run full- time in 2002 with driver Trent Owens and jeans manufacturer Dickies sponsoring the truck. After Owens attempted seven races, he was replaced by Rich Bickle, who had a sixth-place run in his first race. Before the Power Stroke Diesel 200, Dickies had signed a deal to sponsor Bobby Hamilton Racing's No. 18 truck and driver Robert Pressley for the remainder of 2002 and all of 2003, causing the team to go without major sponsorship. Mark Gibson returned for two races, followed by Brian Rose before Andy Houston finished out the year. Houston was signed for 2003 with Vokal Clothing sponsoring. Houston had a top-five finish at Daytona, but was released after five races, and Bickle returned with a top- ten finish. Mike Skinner then drove for four races as the team switched to Dodge for various races. After separate three-race runs by Ryan Hemphill and Robby Benton, Bickle returned to run Fords and had two twelfth-place runs. In 2004, Ballew switched to Chevrolet and hired Shane Hmiel to drive the truck full-time, with sponsorship from Small's Harley-Davison, Whittaker Farms, and later Trim Spa. Hmiel would bring Ballew his first Truck Series win at the Las Vegas 350, passing Todd Bodine late in the race. Hmiel moved to the Busch Series in 2005, and Kerry Earnhardt was originally hired to drive the 15, and won the pole for the season-opening race in the Kraft Foods truck, but was replaced after two races for Hmiel. Kyle Busch and ditech then took the truck, and won his first two races in the ride. Blake Feese, Martin Truex, Jr., Kenny Wallace, Johnny Sauter, and David Gilliland ran one-race deals for the team, and John Andretti had two top-tens in four races. Busch finished out the season, and added another win at Atlanta. In 2006, Ballew signed on ARCA RE/MAX Series driver Kyle Krisiloff, with sponsorship from ditech. However, after conflicts with Kyle's father Steve, a famous USAC driver, Ballew would release Krisiloff and again field multiple drivers. The rotation included recently reinstated driver Kevin Grubb, Andretti, Mike Wallace, and Busch returned to the team. The best finish came for Busch, who finished second at Texas. For 2007, African-American driver Bill Lester was tapped to drive the No. 15 truck. However, with ongoing sponsorship difficulties midway through the season, Lester stepped out of the truck, handing it over to drivers Denny Hamlin, Andrew Myers, J. R. Norris and Shane Sieg. Rookie Marc Mitchell was signed to compete for Rookie of the Year in the 15 with Hyprene Ergon sponsoring for 21 races in 2008. He drove thirteen before being replaced by a variety of drivers, including Hamlin, David Stremme, Ryan Lawler, Kenny Wallace, John Andretti, James Buescher, and Jason White. For 2009, Sieg, Ickler, Aric Almirola, and Blake Feese shared the No. 15. Ted Musgrave, Steve Wallace, Johnny Benson, Nelson Piquet Jr, and Johanna Long shared the 15 in 2010. =Vision Aviation Racing= Vision Aviation Racing team logo In 2011, Ballew merged his organization with K&N; West Series team Vision Aviation Racing. Their drivers Dusty Davis and Justin Johnson ran for Rookie of the Year. However, since neither driver was approved to run at Daytona International Speedway, two-time Daytona 500 winner Michael Waltrip drove the No. 15 at Daytona in the 2011 NextEra Energy Resources 250 with sponsorship from the Wounded Warrior Project and NASCAR.com RaceView. Waltrip would later win the race, on the 10th anniversary of his first Cup Series win as well as the 10th anniversary of the death of Dale Earnhardt in the 2001 Daytona 500. Just seconds after winning, a broken rear spoiler was discovered on his truck. Despite the infraction, Waltrip kept the emotional victory and his truck builder was fined $15,000 and put on probation for the broken piece. The team fielded West Series driver Dusty Davis for only two races before shutting down temporarily. VAR fielded Formula One World Champion Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen in his NASCAR debut at Charlotte Motor Speedway. The team then shut down and laid off many of its employees. The No. 15 was used by Kyle Busch Motorsports as a second entry for other drivers. Engine builder Joey Arrington bought VAR's remaining equipment and fielded trucks for David Starr and Dusty Davis. Truck No. 51 history The 51 truck made its debut at Lowe's Motor Speedway in 2006 with Kyle Busch driving. The use of the number and the name \\"Rowdy Busch\\" over the door were a tribute to Rowdy Burns in the film \\"Days of Thunder\\". With sponsorship from National Land Liquidations, Busch won his first race in the truck, and finished eighth in his next race in the truck at Dover. Johnny Sauter and Martin Truex Jr also ran one race apiece in the 51. In 2007, Busch ran a majority of the races with the Flanders Beef Patties truck, and winning twice. Kenny Wallace, Aric Almirola, and Paul Menard each ran one race in the truck, with Kelly Sutton driving in four races with Copaxone sponsorship. In 2008, Busch and Shane Sieg shared driving duties in the 51, running Toyota Tundras with NOS Energy Drink, Miccosukee Indian Resort & Gaming, and San Bernardino County as sponsors. Busch drove the No. 51 part- time in 2009 with NOS and Miccosukee returning as sponsors, and Brian Ickler drove the races when Busch did not. After 2009, Busch formed his own team, Kyle Busch Motorsports, and signed Ickler as a driver. Aric Almirola ran the full 2010 season with Graceway Pharmaceuticals sponsoring. Almirola took two wins and scored 21 top-tens en route to finishing 2nd in points to Todd Bodine. Almirola left the team to drive JR Motorsports' No. 88 Chevrolet. Almirola drove for VAR at Daytona, though the No. 51 was intended to be driven by VAR development driver Justin Johnson. Financial problems forced Vision Aviation owners to shut down the Truck team. Chris Fontaine drove the truck at Dover. The team was bought out by Ballew once more and fielded a Ford for Colin Braun in 2 races. Kyle Busch Motorsports ran the 51 for various drivers, including Josh Richards and German Quiroga for a few races in 2011. On August 31, 2012, Billy Ballew Motorsports returned to truck competition by fielding the No. 51 Chevy for Sprint Cup Series driver Kurt Busch in the Jeff Foxworthy's Grit Chips 200 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. This was the team's first race in 2012, after shutting its doors at the end of the 2011 season. Busch qualified the truck in 19th out of 36th place and finished in 10th. The truck used for this race was chassis number 11, which enjoyed a long history of wins for the team (12 total). That truck was fielded with support from Phoenix Racing.

It is a student-run publication that publishes weekly on Wednesdays during the academic year with additional issues during commencement and orientation. The Mirror staff has won numerous Excellence in Journalism Awards from the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists. History The students of Fairfield University founded and published the first edition of The Mirror in 1977. The newspaper was founded after the merging of two prior publications: one produced under the supervision of the University (The Voice), and one published independently (The Free Press and Review). The genesis of the change to The Mirror, was Ned Barnett. who as Editor in Chief of The Voice, was one of the driving forces to create an independent newspaper. In addition, the University was seeking to limit its liability from the publication of a student-run media outlet. The Mirror's first Editor in Chief was Robert M. \\"Doc\\" Dougherty, who was responsible for the editorial content, and Frank Godfrey, the Business Manager, who was responsible for the paper's finances and operations as an independent, incorporated entity. The paper was printed by Stratford Printing, and delivered weekly to campus dorms, classroom buildings, and the Campus Center. The online edition was founded in 2000, and it was the first partner to have a signed contract with the now ubiquitous College Publisher network of online student newspapers. The Mirror incorporated full-process color in the print edition for the first time in the early 2000s. Dr. James Simon had been the adviser of The Mirror since 1998, but the role was given to Associate English professor Tommy Xie in spring 2011 before being passed on to professor Matt Tullis in fall 2018. =2009 He Said/She Said controversy= In 2009 a controversy erupted over the recurring humorous columns He Said/She Said, which typically offer a male and female perspective on some issue. The October 1, 2009 issue's columns focused on best practices for conducting one night stands and the walk of shame at Fairfield. The columns (especially the \\"He Said\\" column by student Chris Surette) resulted in immediate controversy among students and administrators.http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/northeast/view/20091112fairfield_u_newspaper_faces_discipline_over_columns_harassment/srvc=home&position;=recent There was a sit-in protest of students at the Mirror's campus offices, and public rebukes from the University president and from dean of students Thomas Pellegrino. Pellegrino informed The Mirror was that they had violated the ethical guidelines in the paper's funding agreement with the University, and that this funding agreement was \\"null and void\\". Later, a group of students sought disciplinary action against The Mirror claiming the offensive content in the \\"He Said\\" column had violated the school's harassment policy. *Chris Surette's \\"He Said\\" column In its first issue of 2010 the Mirror announced that He Said/She Said column would be discontinued. =Excellence in Journalism Awards= *In 2007, six Mirror staff writers won ten collegiate journalism awards from the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists including four first place awards for editorial writing, general column writing, sport story writing and sports photography.Campus Currents :: June 2007 *In 2008, seven Mirror staff writers won nine collegiate journalism awards from the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists including four first place awards for editorial writing, general column writing, sport story writing and sports photography.WINNERS 2007 EXCELLENCE IN JOURNALISM CONTEST *In 2009, eight Mirror staff writers won fourteen collegiate journalism awards from the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists including four first place awards for editorial column, feature photo, news photo, sport story. *In 2017, four Mirror staff writers won five collegiate journalism awards from the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists including four first place awards for front page layout, non-front page layout and one second for news story.

He is believed to have been the longest serving police officer in California with more than 50 years of continuous service. He is a well-known figure in the California law enforcement community. Plummer worked to get the ACSO certified by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), the American Correctional Association (ACA), National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) and the California Medical Association (MA). Three of these accreditations are known as the \\"Triple Crown\\" and are considered a high honor in the law enforcement community. The ACSO is one of a handful of agencies to hold this distinction nationwide. Throughout his career, Plummer had been known to impose strict limits on the issuance and distribution of Concealed Weapons permits to Alameda County residents, maintaining that citizens should be required to show a legitimate need for protection before the permit would be issued. In the year 2000, a total of only 150 concealed weapons permits were issued, out of the thousands of applicants. In addition, Plummer required that permit holders carry liability insurance for $1,000,000 and demonstrate to his Department's rangemaster that the applicants were proficient in the use of firearms. Plummer was a field commander for the Berkeley Police Department when riots erupted in People's Park in 1969. Prior to being elected as sheriff, he was the Chief of Police for Hayward, California. Plummer retired 13 January 2007 after serving five terms as sheriff. Gregory J. Ahern, a 26-year veteran of the sheriff's office, was elected to succeed him. Plummer continued to work one or two days a week at the department's Office of Emergency Services as an unofficial \\"sheriff emeritus\\" until his death. On January 8, 2007, at his retirement ceremony celebrating 50-plus years in law enforcement, outgoing Alameda County Sheriff Charles Plummer remained unrepentant about his role as a Berkeley police officer during the People's Park riots.

Opened on July 4, 1976, it was located at 940 Early Maxwell Blvd. It was structured under the nonprofit 501(c)4 US tax code. It closed due to financial reasons in 2005. History Libertyland opened as an amusement park on the Mid-South Fairgrounds on July 4, 1976. Before then, the fair had operated on the land, including the Coaster Pippin renamed Zippin Pippin with the opening of Libertyland and the Grand Carousel. The city of Memphis decided it was time for a theme park for the city. It opened in 1976 with several rides, including the pre-existing rides that had operated in that place before. The Zippin Pippin was widely popular as it was Elvis Presley's favorite wooden roller coaster. In fact, on August 8, 1977, Elvis rented Libertyland as a gift for his daughter, Lisa Marie Presley. From 1 am until dawn, Elvis, Lisa Marie, Elvis' then-fiance Ginger Alden and about a dozen friends rode the park's then fourteen rides. The Grand Carousel was also a classic and was widely appreciated. The park gradually drew in decent crowds over the years, but never made a great profit. It continued to add attractions, such as a steel coaster called the Revolution, and others. During the late 1990s, it added a Top Spin ride, dubbed \\"Tidal Wave.\\" It was removed later, and in April 2002, the drop tower Rebellion was added. It featured a drop and drew larger crowds to the park. Attractions Libertyland featured around 24 attractions. *Bumper Boats *Car-Go-Round *Casey's Cannonball Train Ride *Dragon Wagon *Fun Run *Grand Carousel *Kamikaze *Little Bumper Boats *Old Hickory Log Flume *Paratrooper *Park's Peak *Pirate Ship *Rebellion *Red Baron *Revolution *Screamer *Sea Dragon *Surf City Water Slide *Tennessee Tilt *Thriller *Turnpike Antique Cars *Twain's Twister *Umbrella Ride *Wipeout *Zippin Pippin Financial troubles For many years, it was widely known that Libertyland was having financial difficulties, failing to turn a profit. Few new attractions were being added, and crowds began to diminish. In 2005, it commissioned a firm to redo its image. A new logo was designed and buildings were repainted, but the effort did not bring in enough of a profit, if any, to maintain the park as a viable ongoing operation. Although the operating loss was minimal compared to the tax revenue generated in area around he park by tourist. The city later spent more than the operating loss on a youth jobs creation program to replace the jobs lost by teenagers who worked at the park. Closure The park operated its last day for a corporate day on October 29, 2005. In early November, a meeting was called before the Mid-South Fair board of committee to close it. The vote was passed and the announcement was made public. Their reasonings included lack of profit, a steady decline of attendance, and they wanted to extend the midway for the annual Mid-South Fair which operates adjacent to the park's site for 10 days in October. Its closure followed that of Adventure River, Memphis' only water park by less than ten years. The City of Memphis had also closed Bud Boogie Beach in the early 1990s. Grass Roots Effort Within days of the announcement to close the park, a group formed to save it. Save Libertyland! fought against Mid-South Fair to keep it open, citing that it drew in hundreds of jobs for the Memphis area teens and was one of the few places for families to spend time there., Misty J. White - Join in bold re-imagining of fairgroundsThe Commercial Appeal, April 3, 2009. Several benefits were held to gain support for the movement. The park brought in a few companies willing to purchase it, mainly Joyland, Inc. (T-Rex Entertainment), which was known for buying financially troubled amusement parks and turning them around. Though there was a debate over who actually had rights to the rides since, in reality, the city actually owned some of them. Mid-South Fair did not back down and went on with plans to auction the assets off. Auction & Post-Movement Mid-South Fair brought in an auctioneer group and the auction was held on June 21, 2006. Most of the rides were sold, including the Zippin Pippin, which sold for only $2,500. It was bought by a traveling rock museum who only wanted one of the train's cars. Carolina Crossroads later bought it but decided not to move it. It has now been bought by the city of Green Bay, Wisconsin, which rebuilt it at their city-owned Bay Beach Amusement Park. The Revolution was bought by DelGrosso's Amusement Park but has yet to be erected as of April 2010. Other rides were dispersed to other locations around the country. The Rebellion was sold to Ghost Town in the Sky and reopened in 2007. In December 2006, Joyland Inc. made a bold move and sent the city a letter of intent stating their intention of reopening the park, more as a new amusement park on the former site. The deal was to be completed on a three-year lease plan. However, upon viewing it in person, Joyland Inc. pulled out of the deal due to extensive damage including infrastructure damage, wiring, and plumbing. Outcome The Grand Carousel was bought by The Children's Museum Of Memphis and has been in operation for many years following its closure. The Revolution was bought by an amusement park in the Philippines and now operates as The Zimerman Corkscrew Coaster. The Zippin Pippin is in Wisconsin and is still operating to this day. People with Tennessee State IDs or drivers licenses can ride the Pippin for free. The area is now a massive parking lot and green space known as Tiger Lane that has also added a disc golf course named Libertyland to a large part of it on the south end.

The only crossing between Burton Upon Trent and Nottingham, it is currently Grade I Listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. =History= Swarkestone bridge was built in the 13th century to cross the river and its surrounding marshes, between the villages of Swarkstone and Stanton by Bridge. It was financed by the two 'Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fianc√©s, however, had to meet the local barons on the far side of the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen; eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback: both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so that no one else would suffer the tragedy they had. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge. Swarkstone bridge is three quarters of a mile long and has 17 arches. It is the longest stone bridge in England, and the longest inland bridge in England. In 1745, Swarkstone Bridge was the furthest point South Bonny Prince Charlie, and his troops, got in his attempt to reclaim the British Throne. According to Pevsner, the present part actually crossing the river, which has 5 arches, dates from the 18th century and was designed by Thomas Harrison.Pevsner N, The Buildings of England . Derbyshire 2nd edition revised (1978) by Elizabeth Williamson, Penguin Books. 'Swarkeston', p.337 Substantial work was carried out in 1795‚Äì1797 by Thomas Sykes, County Surveyor of Bridges for Derbyshire, at a cost of ¬£3,550. =The bridge today= The bridge is undersized for modern traffic and is scarcely two-lane for cars at several points. Though there is a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes, the walls of the bridge often take damage from traffic. =Local legends= The bridge is subject to several local legends. It is supposed to be haunted by the ghosts of the two Bellamont Sisters that constructed the bridge. Others have alleged the bridge is haunted by Bonny Prince Charlie's troops. The most commonly reported phenomenon is the sound of horses approaching at speed when there is nothing about. The bridge is also subject to a local legend which says that the river must claim 3 lives every year in order for it to be 'pacified'. The bridge is a local accident black-spot, with 15 reported road-traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010.A CAR that caused a fatal crash on Swarkestone Bridge should not have been on the road, according to a police vehicle examiner.

The barrow is a registered national monument. In the Domesday Book, Swarkestone was held by the King (William the conqueror) and by Henry de Ferrers. In the Battle of Swarkestone Bridge during the English Civil War (1643) it was defended by the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, but the outnumbered Cavaliers lost the day. In 1745 during the Jacobite rising led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, the advance party of his army reached here to gain control of the crossing of the Trent. Finding no reports of support from the south, they turned back to Derby; the invading army then retreated to Scotland and final defeat at the Battle of Culloden. Swarkestone thereby being the most southerly point reached during that army's advance on London.

Parallax Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells BASIC Stamp microcontrollers, Propeller microcontrollers, microcontroller accessories (such as LCDs, sensors, RF modules, etc.), educational robot kits, and educational curriculum. Parallax is headquartered in Rocklin. The Rocklin office employs thirty-five people in research and development, sales, manufacturing, education, marketing, and technical support. Parallax Inc. has over seventy distributors around the world, including Radio Shack, Jameco Electronics, and Fry's Electronics. History Originally established in 1987, in Rocklin, California, Parallax Inc. manufactured products such as the ISEPIC, TopRAM, and the first third- party Microchip PIC Programmer. In 1992, the BASIC Stamp 1 microcontroller module was released. In 1995, the BASIC Stamp 2 module was added to the product lineup. By 2002, there were over three million BASIC Stamp microcontrollers in use around the world. In 1997, the Stamps in Class program was created to provide educational resources that addressed the needs of electronic students ages 14 and up. The Boe-Bot is one of the company‚Äôs most popular products in the educational program. In 1998, Parallax Inc. formed a partnership with Ubicom (formerly Scenix Semiconductor) to develop tools and BASIC Stamps using their new SX microcontrollers. Company founder Chip Gracey designed the SX-Key Programming Tool to make programming Ubicom‚Äôs SX chips affordable. And in 2005, Parallax Inc. and Ubicom formed an agreement in which Parallax Inc. was made the exclusive supplier of the SX microcontroller. In 2006, after eight years of development time, Parallax launched their Parallax Propeller microcontroller. The Propeller 2 multicore processor is under development and does not have a release date yet. The Propeller 2 processor includes features commonly requested by customers such as code protection, additional RAM and more input/output pins. Popular chips and robots =The Propeller chip= The Propeller is a multicore system that can do real-time simultaneous multiprocessing. It uses eight 32-bit cores called cogs controlled by a bus controller called the Hub. It can be programmed in assembly, C, or in the interpreted Spin programming language. It comes with a software library of objects for a various sets of input/output devices, such as UARTs and a video display controller emulated fully in software. The Propeller is also supported by third-party compiler developers who have developed platforms in C and BASIC. The Parallax Propeller is also recognized as being easy to program. =The BASIC Stamp and BASIC Stamp 2= Released in 1995, the BASIC Stamp was so named because it was about the size of a postage stamp. Programmed in PBASIC, the BASIC Stamp found an audience in electronic hobbyists with powerful I/O commands that made it easy to connect to other electronic components. =The Boe-Bot= The Boe-Bot is a programmable wheeled robot with a BASIC Stamp 2 brain that is used by educators and hobbyists. After being introduced in 1998, it is one of Parallax's top selling robots. =Sensors= Parallax manufactures sensors to measure distance, color, humidity, temperature, pressure, RPMs, heat, and altitude. These sensors are either surface-mounted components on a printed circuit board or in packages that are readily acceptable for breadboard-style mounting. Each sensor is supported with educational curriculum and documentation. Education =Stamps in Class= Launched in 1997, Stamps In Class curriculum was designed to introduce students and educators to BASIC Stamp microcontrollers using software basics, circuit building, and simple hardware. One tutorial in the Stamps in Class series is the Boe-Bot, a simple yet versatile rolling robot that has a BASIC Stamp brain. =Propeller education labs= The Propeller education program was developed to teach how to operate the Propeller chip. The Propeller features eight 32-bit processors. The Propeller education program demonstrates how to program the microcontroller for use in process control, measurement and signal generation and robotics. The program is designed for engineering students who have product design requirements in their curriculum. Featured in magazines Filling a niche in the technology market by offering robotics for hobbyists, enthusiasts, and students, Parallax has been featured in magazines including: Make Magazine, SERVO Magazine, Robot Magazine, and Nuts and Volts. Unofficial Propeller Expo =History= The original UPE, the Unofficial Propeller Expo North East (UPENE) was hosted by a long time Parallax Forum member, \\"Oldbitcollector.\\" He labeled it \\"Unofficial\\" so hobbyists could meet and exchange projects, ideas, and advice about Parallax robotics without getting permission to host an \\"Official Propeller Expo.\\" However, Parallax came on board and now many Parallax employees can be found at each expo, talking with hobbyists, students, and inventors. =Unofficial Propeller Expo North East (UPENE)= The UPENE was an annual event located in Norwalk, Ohio, at the Norwalk Community Center. The expo consists of educators, engineers, hobbyists and students setting up tables and sharing their experiments, demonstrations, and products based on or inspired by microcontrollers such as the Parallax Propeller. The UPENE was the first of the three existing UPE's. As Parallax unofficially sponsors the expo, the company was joined by a second sponsor: the company Gadget Gangster. =Unofficial Propeller Expo Chicago (UPEC)= The UPEC, also known as the \\"Chicagoland Propeller Expo,\\" was a one-day event held at the 807 Building in Ottawa, Illinois. =Unofficial Propeller Expo West (UPEW)= The UPEW, was the only one of the three UPE's to be located at Parallax's offices in Rocklin, California. This UPE also offers a special educator's course hosted by Parallax's engineer and author Andy Lindsay. The Parallax forum Before 2004, the Parallax product user support forum was hosted in Yahoo!

It is stationed at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Known as \\"America's Cryptologic Wing\\", is the only Air Force wing that supports the National Security Agency, the Sixteenth Air Force, and the entire United States Air Force with cryptologic intelligence. The 70th Reconnaissance Group conducted observation, artillery adjustment and fighter and bomber support training with United States Army ground forces during World War II. The group served as a reserve unit for two years later in the decade. During the Cold War, the 70th was a component wing of Strategic Air Command's (SAC) deterrent force as a strategic reconnaissance organization and heavy bombardment wing. Mission The main entrance to Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, home of the 70th ISR Wing. The wing's mission is to provide multi-source, multi-service intelligence products for the Department of Defense (DoD) by gaining and exploiting information as a major component of the Air Force and DoD global intelligence mission. It trains and equips cryptologic and information operations specialists to carry out Air Force ISR Agency and National Security Agency joint-service operations. The wing has six groups, 19 squadrons, 10 detachments and 26 operating locations spanning four continents. The wing falls under the Sixteenth Air Force at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. 543d Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group is based at the Medina Annex, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. A unique group within the wing. Organized according to mission, rather than by geography, the 543rd ISR Group has two squadrons within the United States that are part of Regional Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Operations Centers. Providing command and control, personnel, communications, computer and logistics support for all Regional SIGINT Operations Centers conducting information operations, the 543rd ISR Group provides timely and accurate multi-regional SIGINT to warfighters and other intelligence users.

After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the unit began antisubmarine patrols along the Pacific Coast, and provided support to II Bomber Command heavy bomber training units. It was largely unmanned after August 1943 when the United States Navy took over antisubmarine duty. The group moved to Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma under Third Air Force in November 1943, and was programmed for training as a photo-reconnaissance unit, but the unit was never manned or equipped and was inactivated 30 November 1943. The group was reactivated as part of the Air Force Reserve in 1947 as a reconnaissance group at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. It was assigned to Fourth Air Force, but it is unclear whether or not the unit had any assigned aircraft or personnel. It was inactivated in 1949 when Continental Air Command converted its reserve units to the Wing-Base organizational system (Hobson Plan). =Strategic Reconnaissance= 70th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing patch (unofficial) The 70th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was established by SAC on 23 March 1953, at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. However, Little Rock AFB was still under construction at the time, so the unit was temporarily stationed at Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio until October. Few wing components were manned until October when Little Rock was ready for operational use.Ravenstein, Combat Wings pp. 109‚Äì110 The 70th SRW's mission was to gather intelligence on a global scale as part of the strategic reconnaissance force of SAC. Equipped with Boeing RB-47E Stratojets, the wing conducted a variety of spectacular overflights of the Soviet Union during the 1950s, including overflying Murmansk. RB-47s had a fairly low operational ceiling of 40,000 feet and relied on speed, as opposed to altitude, to evade interception. Some of these flights were mounted from Thule, Greenland, and probed deep into the heart of the Soviet Union, taking a photographic and radar recording of the route attacking SAC bombers would follow to reach their targets. The risks involved in mounting these dangerous sorties speaks volumes for the courage and skill of the crews involved. Flights that involved penetrating mainland Russia were termed SENSINT (Sensitive Intelligence) missions. One RB-47 even managed to fly 450 miles inland and photograph the city of Igarka in Siberia. The 70th SRW also assumed an air refueling mission in 1955 and was deployed at Sidi Slimane Air Base, Morocco, from 26 October to 17 December 1956. Beginning in February 1958, operations with the RB-47 were reduced, primarily as the aircraft was determined to be vulnerable to Soviet air defenses, but also its mission was being taken over by the Lockheed U-2. From June 1958 to September 1961, the wing became a B-47 bombardment and reconnaissance organization, providing B/RB-47 combat crew training for other SAC units, while undertaking RB-47 and Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker operations. The refueling squadron transferred in August 1961, and the final RB-47 class graduated in October 1961. It converted to B-47s in late 1961 but inactivated prior to becoming combat ready. =Strategic bombardment= 4123rd Strategic Wing emblem 4123d Strategic Wing On 10 December 1957, SAC established the 4123d Strategic Wing (SW) at Carswell Air Force BaseTexasMueller, pp. 63‚Äì70 and assigned it to the 19th Air Division. The wing was assigned the 4123d Air Base Squadron, which had been the host unit at Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, Oklahoma since July 1955, preparing Clinton-Sherman, a former World War II Naval Air Station, to receive operational SAC aircraft plus the 98th Bombardment Squadron (BS), consisting of 15 Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses, which had been one of the three squadrons of the 7th Bombardment WingMaurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 326 and a maintenance squadron at Carswell. The air base squadron was expanded into the 4123d Air Base Group and assigned component squadrons on 1 July 1958. At the end of 1958, the wing's first operational squadron, the 902d Air Refueling Squadron, flying Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, was activated at Clinton-Sherman and the wing moved its headquarters to the base on 25 February 1959 and was reassigned to the 816th Air Division at the beginning of March. Within a week the 98th Bombardment Squadron joined the wing at Clinton-Sherman as part of SAC's plan to disperse its Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. The same month, the 55th Aviation Depot Squadron was activated to oversee the wing's special weapons. Starting in 1960, one third of the wing's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled, armed and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike. This was increased to half the wing's aircraft in 1962. The 4123d (and later the 70th) continued to maintain an alert commitment until inactivation. In 1962, the wing's bombers began to be equipped with the GAM-77 Hound Dog and the GAM-72 Quail air-launched cruise missiles, The 4123d Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron was activated in November to maintain these missiles However, SAC Strategic Wings could not carry a permanent history or lineage and SAC looked for a way to make its Strategic Wings permanent. 70th Bombardment Wing Patch 70th Bombardment Wing In 1962, in order to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive bombardment units with illustrious World War II records, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue its Major Command controlled (MAJCON) strategic wings that were equipped with combat aircraft and to activate Air Force controlled (AFCON) units, most of which were inactive at the time which could carry a lineage and history.MAJCON units could not carry a permanent history or lineage. Ravenstein, Guide to Air Force Lineage, p. 12 As a result, the 4123d SW was replaced by the newly redesignated 70th Bombardment Wing, Heavy (70th BW), which assumed its mission, personnel, and equipment on 1 February 1963.The 70th Wing continued, through temporary bestowal, the history, and honors of the World War II 70th Reconnaissance Group. It was also entitled to retain the honors (but not the history or lineage) of the 4123d. This temporary bestowal ended in January 1984, when the wing and group were consolidated into a single unit. In the same way the 6th Bombardment Squadron, one of the unit's B-47 reconnaissance squadrons, replaced the 98th BS.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 759 The 857th Medical Group, 55th Munitions Maintenance Squadron and the 902d Air Refueling Squadron were reassigned to the 70th. The 4123d's maintenance and support units were replaced by units with numerical designation of the newly established wing. Under the Dual Deputate organization, all flying and maintenance squadrons were directly assigned to the wing, so no operational group element was activated. Each of the new units assumed the personnel, equipment, and mission of its predecessor. The 70th BW conducted strategic bombardment training and air refueling missions from February 1963 to December 1969. It was upgraded to the B-52D in 1968 by SAC along with receiving some older B-52Cs, which had limited use for training new aircrews. For several months in both 1968 and 1969, all of the 70th BW aircraft, most of the aircrew and maintenance personnel and some of its support people were loaned to other SAC units engaged in combat operations in the Far East and Southeast Asia. It was one of 11 SAC bomb wings that rotated such combat duty under the program known as Arc Light. By 1969, Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) had been deployed and become operational as part of the United States' strategic triad, and the need for B-52s had been reduced. In addition, funds were also needed to cover the costs of combat operations in Indochina. The 70th Bombardment Wing was inactivated 31 December 1969, and its aircraft were reassigned to other SAC units. As part of the inactivation, Clinton-Sherman AFB was closed. =Modern era= The wing was redesignated the 70th Air Base Group and operated and maintained Brooks Air Force Base, Texas from October 1994 until that installation's BRAC-directed closure in September 2011. It supported the Human Systems Center until October 1998, when the Center was redesignated as the 311th Human Systems Wing. The group's mission, personnel, and equipment were all transferred to the 311th Air Base Group. In August 2000, the unit was activated as the 70th Intelligence Wing, then later the 70th Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Wing, and has managed the USAF portion of the DoD's cryptology mission, exploiting intelligence, integrating it into air and space operations, and assisting commanders and others with intelligence requirements.

The airport is privately owned by Princeton Aero Corp. The airport houses the Raritan Valley Flying School, Elite Flight Experience/Cirrus Training Center, Pacific Aircraft, Analar Helicopter Charter and Platinum Helicopters.  History  The airport was established by Richard A. Newhouse (original spelling Neuhaus). Among his other aviation-related projects, in 1911 he built a plane of his own design, featuring separate floating ailerons -- a major innovation, as the planes of that time used wing warping for roll control. The paved runway opened about 1965, and the airport has since had occasional commuter airline flights-- e.g. in 1979, Princeton Airways was operating fifteen scheduled passenger flights to Newark each weekday with Britten-Norman Islander STOL capable aircraft. Princeton Airways also flew scheduled passenger service from the airport with the GAF Nomad STOL capable turboprop. On March 29, 1985, the airport was purchased by Princeton Aero Corp. Principals of the company are members of the Nierenberg family, previously the fixed-base operator at Kupper Airport for eighteen years.  Facilities  Princeton Airport covers and has one paved runway (10/28), 3,500 x 75 ft (1,067 x 23 m). In the year ending July 2, 2012 the airport had 39,421 aircraft operations, average 108 per day: 87% general aviation and 13% air taxi. 48 aircraft are based at the airport: 85% single engine, 2% multi-engine and 13% helicopters.

Biography Lindley grew up in the south-west London suburb of Surbiton. He was an only child and his father was a local building contractor. Lindley recalled (to Adrian Smith) that the family had \\"little culture\\" and that both his parents were \\"proud of the fact that they had never read a book.\\" The school Lindley attended, Tiffin School, introduced him to \\"ordinary cultural activities.\\"\\"The Lindley Prize ‚Äì Dennis V. Lindley\\", International Society for Bayesian Analysis, accessed 28 June 2008 From there Lindley went to read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1941. During the war the degree course lasted only two years and, on finishing, Lindley had a choice between entering the armed forces and joining the Civil Service as a statistician. He chose the latter and, after taking a short course given by Oscar Irwin which he \\"did not understand\\", he joined a section of the Ministry of Supply doing statistical work under George Barnard. After the war Lindley spent some time at the National Physical Laboratory before returning to Cambridge for a further year of study. From 1948 to 1960 he worked at Cambridge, starting as a demonstrator and leaving as director of the Statistical Laboratory. In 1960 Lindley left to take up a new chair at Aberystwyth. In 1967 he moved to University College London. In 1977 Lindley took early retirement at the age of 54. From then until 1987 he travelled the world as an \\"itinerant scholar\\", and later continued to write and to attend conferences. He was awarded the Royal Statistical Society's Guy Medal in Gold in 2002. Lindley first encountered statistics as a set of techniques and in his early years at Cambridge he worked to find a mathematical basis for the subject. His lectures on probability were based on Kolmogorov's approach which at that time had no following in Britain. In 1954 Lindley met Savage who was also looking for a deeper justification of the ideas of Neyman, Pearson, Wald and Fisher. Both found that justification in Bayesian theory and they turned into critics of the classical statistical inference they had hoped to justify. Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley's move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: \\"it was as though a Jehovah's Witness had been elected Pope.\\" In 1959 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.View/Search Fellows of the ASA, accessed 2016-07-23.

Big Rock operated from 1962 to 1997. It was owned and operated by Consumers Power, now known as Consumers Energy. Its boiling water reactor was made by General Electric (GE) and was capable of producing 67 megawatts of electricity. Bechtel Corporation was the primary contractor. History Big Rock was Michigan's first nuclear power plant and the nation's fifth. It also produced cobalt-60 for the medical industry from 1971 to 1982. Ground was broken on July 20, 1960. Construction was completed in 29 months at a cost of $27.7 million. Its license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was issued on August 29, 1962. The reactor first went critical on September 27 and the first electricity was generated on December 8, 1962. A promotional video for the plant featured then GE spokesman Ronald Reagan. Facts and figures * Reactor vessel dimensions: tall x in diameter * Thickness of rector vessel walls: 5¬Ω inches * A single 10-ton load of uranium nuclear fuel in Big Rock's reactor could generate the same amount of electricity as 260,000 tons of coal. *The stack that once stood behind the main generator of the plant was used as a navigational landmark to let boaters aboard freighters have a visual landmark to Charlevoix, Michigan. Closure and decommissioning Consumers Energy had previously announced that Big Rock Point's operating license would not be renewed when it expired on May 31, 2000. However, economics proved in January 1997 that it was not feasible to keep Big Rock Point running to the license's expiration date. The reactor was scrammed for the last time on at 10:33 a.m. EDT on August 29, 1997, 35 years to the day after its license had been issued. The last fuel was removed from the core on September 20. Decontamination was completed in 1999. During the decommissioning process it was discovered that a backup safety system at the plant had been inoperable for at least the previous 14 years. The Liquid Poison System (LPS) consisted of a tank filled with a liquid solution containing boron, a neutron absorber. In the event of a control rod failure during a reactor scram, the LPS system would have drained the boron solution into the core thus halting the nuclear chain reaction. However, during decommissioning when technicians attempted to drain the tank they were unable to do so due to a corroded pipe. Because of its contributions to the nuclear and medical industries, the American Nuclear Society named Big Rock Point a Nuclear Historic Landmark. The reactor vessel was removed on August 25, 2003 and shipped to Barnwell, South Carolina on October 7, 2003. All of Big Rock Point's area has been torn down. Other than eight spent fuel casks, there are no signs that the site was home to a nuclear power plant. Decommissioning costs totaled $390,000,000. Reuse of property In July 2006, the state of Michigan announced it was considering buying the site, which features a mile of Lake Michigan shoreline, for a possible state park. As part of the sale of Consumers' Palisades Nuclear Plant, the new owner Entergy accepted the responsibility for a basketball court size piece of property at Big Rock containing that plant's eight casks of spent fuel.

This measurement is typically obtained by an orthoptist, ophthalmologist or optometrist during an eye examination using a phoropter. After the patient's distance correction is established, he or she is instructed to view small letters on a card 40 cm from the eyes.

He is an unusually large homunculus, a humanoid being said to be created by means of alchemy. Initially revived by Liz Sherman, Roger is one of the early supporting characters of the \\"Mignola-verse\\", appearing alongside other \\"enhanced\\" B.P.R.D. agents including Sherman, Abe Sapien and Johann Kraus under Dr. Kate Corrigan. Fictional character biography Roger was discovered in 1996 in a medieval alchemist's lab beneath the ruins of Czege Castle, Romania by BPRD agents Liz Sherman, Bud Waller, and Sidney Leach during the Wake the Devil affair. Waller explained that a homunculus is created from blood and herbs, stewed in a jar, and then incubated in horse manure. Although lifeless upon discovery, the as- yet nameless Roger was activated when Liz touched the socket on his chest, absorbing her pyrokinesis as she was subconsciously looking to rid herself of it. As Liz enters a coma, Roger springs to life in a violent rage, killing Waller before fleeing the castle into the countryside. After Liz is rushed to the hospital under the supervision of BPRD doctors, Hellboy and Kate Corrigan arrive to find the homunculus in the hope that Liz's power could be restored to her. Meanwhile, the homunculus was racked by guilt and prayed for God to kill him. However, he soon encountered his 'brother', a more crude homunculus created before himself. The brother sought to take revenge on humanity using a colossal homunculus that he created from human fat. The sinister homunculus captured Kate and planned to sacrifice her for use in the giant homunculus. Roger saved her, but his brother entered the body of the gigantic colossus and began to rampage. While Hellboy struggled against the colossal homunculus, Roger intervened by asking his brother to forgive him. His brother forgave him, and Roger is allowed to join the colossus. Roger then used Liz's power over fire to melt the giant body and slay his brother. Roger returned to base with Hellboy and Kate, and restored Liz's pyrokinesis. Roger, now without a source of energy, returned to his comatose state. Three years later, BPRD scientists were stopped from dissecting Roger's comatose body by Abe Sapien, who used an overdose of electricity to awaken the dormant homunculus. The BPRD fitted Roger with a mobile generator and made him an agent. At the same time, they planted a bomb within him to prevent any uncontrolled outbursts. This decision would later be a factor in Hellboy leaving the Bureau. However, during the Hunte Castle affair in 2001, Roger proved himself as an agent at last when he managed to contain the Conqueror Worm (an energy-based monster from space) within himself, which nearly subsumed his psyche as he managed to destroy Herman von Klempt by throwing them both off a mountain. Roger was saved by the ghost of Lobster Johnson, who used a lightning rod to shock the worm out of Roger. =B.P.R.D.= Roger returned to work with the Bureau, fitted with a new generator. During the invasion of America by frog monsters, Roger proved to be very effective in wiping them out and eventually got promoted to a leadership role and led his own squadron of agents. However, his new-found cockiness proved to be his undoing. Surprised by the villainous Black Flame, who was leading the frog monsters, Roger and his team were blown to pieces. Kate Corrigan went to France to secure the book that could restore Roger to full health. However, the ageless marquis who held the book attempted to bargain for Roger's corpse, using Kate as collateral. Kate managed to overpower the marquis by releasing the demon Marchosias, but in the ensuing carnage the book was lost and Roger's fate was sealed. As of the end of The Universal Machine, Roger's body remained destroyed. When Johann Krauss communicates with Roger's spirit and asks him why he has not \\"gone on,\\" Roger explains that because he is not human, there is no place for his spirit to go, so it simply remains within his body. Roger's spirit exists in a peaceful dream-world resembling an Etruscan shrine dedicated to Cloacina. Roger tells Johann that he is finally at peace and would prefer to stay \\"dead,\\" but tells Johann that he would like his body to be buried in the ground, \\"like a man.\\" Roger's grave, marked with a false identity of \\"Archie Stanton\\", was shown in the first issue of B.P.R.D.: The Garden of Souls.

It originated in Sunderland, Vermont, and is critically endangered. Origin The Randall is a breed of purebred cattle developed in Sunderland, Vermont, USA, on the farm of Samuel Randall, and later his son, Everett Randall. It is a rare breed, thought to descend from the local cattle common in New England in the nineteenth century. The Randall family kept a closed herd for over 80 years. The Randall cattle were bought after the death of Everett Randall by a couple in Massachusetts, who were not interested in keeping them, but merely wanting to make money off of them. Cynthia Creech, then living in Tennessee, to preserve the genetics from extinction stepped in to purchase most of the remaining animals including 5 cows, 4 heifers, 2 yearling bulls, a weanling bull, 2 other calves and a herd bull. Unfortunately most of the cattle were in critical condition, two of the cows died while in Massachusetts, one broke her horn during the trip, many were covered in lice and blood. But due to Cynthia's hard work they were turned into a wonderful herd of working cattle. http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/cattle-breeds#/5Cynthia's Randall Cattle Pages Randall Cattle are an all-purpose breed, meaning they originally served as dairy, meat, and draft animals. From fewer than 20 animals the breed population has increased to over 350 breeding females. Characteristics Randall cattle are quite variable in size and conformation and have a constitution that is suited to the New England climate. Randalls on average are medium in size with the cows weighing about 600-1100 lbs. and bulls weighing from 1000 to 1800 lbs. or more. Randall cattle have a \\"Colour- sided\\" lineback pattern, black markings on a white base, varying from almost white to very dark. Other subtle shades such as blue, mahogany, and gray have been observed, and there are now a number of recessive reds. Randall meat characteristics can vary between different family lines, for example some produce a lean carcass with yellow fat and others produce a beefier well marbled carcass. Calving difficulties are rare, and metabolic disorders have not been seen. They have strong maternal and survival instincts, high intelligence, and are very docile when handled regularly. This breed is uniquely adapted to extensive or low input farming systems. Historically, the most suitable and natural environment for these cattle has been on small scale forage-based farms, subsistence farms, and homesteads. It is on such farms and homesteads that the unique genetic attributes of the Randalls can be fully expressed. .Randall Cattle. Milk production on grass. Philip B.

It is available as either for download or in streaming, as opposed to first airing on broadcast or cable television. The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial.Stelter, Brian (2008-08-31). For Web TV, a Handful of Hits but No Formula for Success. The New York Times. Retrieved on 2009-01-23. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 3-15 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term webisode (a portmanteau formed from the words web and episode) was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009. History Webisodes have become increasingly common in the midst of the post-broadcast era, which implies that audiences are drifting away past free- to-use television design. The Post-Broadcast era has been influenced by new media formats such as the internet. Contemporary trends indicate that the Internet has become the dominant mechanism for accessing Media Content. In 2012, the Nielsen Company reported that the number of American households with television access has diminished for the second straight year, showing that viewers are transitioning away from broadcast television. The post-broadcast era is best defined as embodiment by a complex mediascape that cannot be maintained by broadcast television; in its wake, the popularity of webisodes has expanded because the internet has become a potential solution to television's ailments by combining interpersonal communication and multimedia elements alongside entertainment programing. These original web series are a means to monetize this transitional audience and produce new celebrities, both independently on the web and working in accordance to the previous media industry standards. Content has moved onto the web not through the conventional media's branded websites, but through video services like YouTube; the distribution of television increasingly occurs through viral, rather than broadcast, networks such as those available through blogs or social networking services. Webisodes are also noted for their use of the Internet for further exchange of information, news and gossip about the series on various social networks. Uses in marketing Webisodes are part of a trend called branded entertainment, which is growing due to the increased demand for marketers to find new methods to reach consumers in an era where the traditional media is losing viewers to the social web.Elliot, Stuart (2009-11-23). Shows Online, Brought to You by .... The New York Times Companies create a social buzz online using digitalmedia marketing to generate branded community-based destinations. Webisodes are regularly used by marketers to form these destinations. In 2006, for example, hip-hop entrepreneur Sean Combs, aka P. Diddy, started his own YouTube channel called \\"DiddyTV,\\" which he used to post webisodes and blog about his life on tour.Stanley, T.J. (2006-10-16). Sean Combs Models Himself as a Master of Marketing. \\"Advertising Age\\" Combs built hype around the web series by using his social media sites, such as Myspace, to direct users to the YouTube channel. Combs' webisodes were sponsored by Burger King, which used the web series to generate a brand community. In 2007, Mini Cooper initiated an online marketing campaign to promote their new line of vehicles. The campaign consisted of six webisodes that were each four minutes in duration. Each week a new webisode went up on sites like YouTube. The series was a spoof on the retro television show, Starsky & Hutch and was titled \\"Hammer & Coop.\\" The series told the story of a 1970s based character named Hammer and his car named Coop, while highlighting the improvement of new Mini Cooper's interior.Voight, Joan (2007-03-19). Mini Cooper: Retro Webisodes. Adweek In 2011, Jeff Schroeder, known for his role in the reality series The Amazing Race, assisted AT&T; with a digital marketing scheme based around webisodes. The campaign followed Schroeder around the world in 100 days using only his phone and netbook.Cardona, Mercedes (2011-11-01). Webisodes promote AT&T.; Direct Marketing News Web-based comedy series Some of the most notable webisodes are original comedies generated for an audience online viewers. Original comedies have become the preferred genre for webisodes because they deliver a low budget format for experimentation and prompt results. These original web comedies are a means to monetize the audience. The model for the popular website Funny or Die, is based entirely on distributing a variety of original comedy web series. Comedians Will Ferrell and Adam McKay started this initiative with their series of webisodes about a vulgar two-year-old landlord. The series was streamed over 50 million times on Funny or Die and led the site to earning over $50 million annually.[Graeme Turner, Jinna Tay] Funny or Die received serious attention from major television outlets, resulting in a partnership with HBO and the program Funny or Die Presents, which aired its first episode on HBO in February 2010 and featured recycled footage that had already run on the website.

The first ever SAARC summit hosted by India was held at Nandi Hills in 1986. Etymology There are many stories about the origin of the name Nandi Hills. During the Chola period, Nandi Hills was called Anandagiri meaning The Hill of Happiness. It is also perhaps called Nandi Hills because the hills resemble a sleeping bull. Another theory holds that the hill gets its name from an ancient, 1300-year-old Dravidian-style Nandi is temple situated on this hill.

Biodiversity Vegetation on Nandi Hills The vegetation of the hills is typical of high hills. Inside the fort at the summit, many of the large trees are planted exotics such as Eucalyptus and the undergrowth consists of Coffea arabica along with some native species. The forest acts as a substrate for cloud condensation and every morning the trees are covered in water. This allows for many moist forest species of plants and animals. The hills are very rich in birdlife making it a popular location for birdwatchers and bird photographers. The evergreen forest patch on top of the hill being a favoured wintering location for many migrant species of warblers, flycatchers and thrushes. The forest patch is also home for a relict population of the Nilgiri woodpigeon.Subramanya, S. (2005). Nesting of Wood- Pigeon Columba elphinstonii in Nandi hills, Karnataka, India.

He was the second Bishop of Oklahoma City, as well as an author and diplomat. He was a Catholic priest for 54 years, and bishop for 23 years. Early life Francis Clement Kelley was born in Vernon River, Prince Edward Island, Canada, to John and Mary Kelley. His sister was poet Lucy Gertrude Clarkin. He was educated at St. Dunstan's College, Prince Edward Island, and ordained a priest for the diocese of Detroit, Michigan, in 1893. Father Kelley served as a military chaplain during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, as a captain with the Michigan National Guard. He was later promoted to the rank of colonel. Kelley served as vice commander general of the Military Order of Foreign Wars, a veterans' group, for five years. While pastor in Lapeer, Michigan in 1905, he founded the Catholic Church Extension Society of the United States with the help of James Edward Quigley, Archbishop of Chicago. Kelley was elected its first president. The Extension Society continues to promote the mission of the Catholic Church in rural and mission areas of the United States. Kelley also founded and edited the quarterly Extension Magazine, which had more than 3 million subscribers during his administration. In addition to his editorial duties, he authored numerous books. As a diplomat, Kelley represented the bishops of Mexico during the World War I Peace Conference in Paris. He also initiated unofficial negotiations between the Vatican and the Italian government for a settlement of the Roman Question. Two years after the war, Kelley was sent to England by the Vatican to settle postwar differences over German and American missions. As president of the Extension Society, Kelley also represented the Mexican bishops during the Carranza Revolution. He established a seminary in Texas for exiled Mexican seminarians and clergy. Episcopacy Bishop Kelley's coat of arms Kelley was consecrated Bishop of Oklahoma in 1924. During his years as Bishop, he successfully resisted the agitation of the KKK and continued his work as the \\"Extension Bishop.\\" Like other missionary dioceses in the country, Oklahoma received funds from the Catholic Extension to build and to furnish churches. In 1931, Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church became the new cathedral for the diocese, which had become the Diocese of Oklahoma City-Tulsa in 1930. In 1932, Kelley succeeded Bishop Joseph H. Conroy of Ogdensburg, New York as Chairman of the Bishops Catholic Committee on Scouting. Under his leadership the Catholic Committee expanded to include 22 Archbishops and Bishops, one from each Ecclesiastical Province in the United States. In 1934 the American hierarchy approved a \\"Plan of Cooperation\\" recognizing Scouting as serving the church's interest in the spiritual welfare of Catholic youth, and approving it as an approved youth program in the Church. Bishop Kelly was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1939, the first member of the catholic clergy to be so recognized. Death and legacy Bishop Kelley died in Oklahoma City on February 1, 1948, aged 77. Bishop Kelley High School (in Tulsa, Oklahoma) and Bishop Kelley Catholic School (in Lapeer, Michigan) are named for Bishop Francis Kelley.

Facilities and operation The station is equipped with a passing loop on the largely single-track route, as well as a water-tower for the steam locomotives which chiefly work the line. The passing loop was removed by British Rail some years prior to the end of nationalised operations, as an economy measure. However, this severely restricted the timetable by preventing the simultaneous operation of two trains, and so the loop was reinstated upon privatisation of the line. It is now common for trains to pass each other at this point during the more intensive summer timetable. For operational purposes the railway is divided into three block sections. These are Aberystwyth to Capel Bangor, Capel Bangor to Aberffrwd, and Aberffrwd to Devil's Bridge. Each block station has a passing loop, and the other three (apart from Aberffrwd) also have additional sidings.

This grant led to the Vale of Rheidol Railway making substantial investment in five of its smaller stations. At Aberffrwd this funding has allowed for the construction of two raised and surfaced platforms, permitting passengers to join or alight from trains on the level, and also the construction of a station building containing an open waiting shelter for passengers, and a station office for staff.

He is featured in the comic book B.P.R.D., published by Dark Horse Comics. Kraus is a disembodied ectoplasmic spirit with psychic abilities, who inhabits a containment suit, without which his form would eventually dissipate and be lost forever. A live action version of Kraus, named Johann Krauss, appeared in the 2008 sequel film Hellboy II: The Golden Army, with his voice provided by Seth MacFarlane. Fictional character biography Born in Stuttgart, West Germany, in 1946, Johann Kraus became aware of his psychic abilities when he was ten years old. Frustrated with his inability to help the spirits that appeared to him, he sought out spiritualists in attempts to better understand his powers. Disappointed with occultism, Kraus turned to the church, which allowed him to focus on the spirits themselves rather than the occultist's focus on study and academia. In 1971, he opened an office in Munich, where he became a well-respected medium before relocating to Heidelberg. In early 2002, Kraus was the only survivor of a seance affected by a mystical disaster. His ectoplasmic form survived when his body was incinerated, and knowing he would dissipate without a physical body, he sought out the best paranormal minds on the planet for help: the B.P.R.D. At first, he was sustained inside a transparent tank apparatus developed by the B.P.R.D. for other purposes; eventually the technology was sized down into his distinctive containment suit. Kate Corrigan has said of him that, \\"He's not dead. He just doesn't have a body anymore.\\" After the loss of Hellboy, Kraus was hired to replenish the Bureau's pool of \\"enhanced talents\\". Kraus soon proved an invaluable member of the team. His psychic abilities are better than ever due to his condition (similar to a musician who has lost his eyesight). Where once he could speak with the dead, now he can give them temporary physical form. Johann is also an accomplished scholar in occult lore and, since he no longer requires sleep, works constantly. It was largely he who researched and organized the mountains of files culled from the sub-basement of the Bureau's new base in the Colorado mountains, resulting in the revelation that Ben Daimio's grandmother had been a Nazi occult war criminal. There was tension between the two for some time after this. Their sometimes difficult relationship was perhaps not helped by the death of Roger the homunculus, who Johann had been closer to than perhaps anyone else, owing at least partly to Daimio's actions. When the Bureau came into possession of two giant vat-grown bodies awaiting a soul in the aftermath of the Garden of Souls storyline, Johann took possession of one of these. Overcome by giddy euphoria at finally having regained life, at being able to taste and touch once more, Johann let himself be seduced by the pleasures of the flesh. He all but abandoned his work and commitments to the Bureau to indulge his vices. This proved to be the worst possible time for such a lapse, as the halls of the Bureau came under attack by two separate monsters, one of them the were- jaguar form of Captain Ben Daimio. Johann returned in the nick of time, saving the lives of Kate and Abe, but was himself savagely killed. Condemned to his ectoplasmic half-life once more, Johann began pursuing a private obsession with Ben Daimio, trying to track down his living relatives and hiding the ceremonial dagger that is supposedly the only weapon that can destroy him in his were-jaguar form. In 2009, Johann returned to his beloved Munich for the first time since his 2002 accident during The Warning, only to see it destroyed and its inhabitants killed by a subterranean robot army, a blow from which he has found it hard to recover. Johann has developed a brotherly relationship with zombie Iosif Nichayko, the director of Russia's \\"Special Sciences Service\\" who also lives confined to a containment suit. After a successful mission, Iosif gifted Johann an altered form of his own more advanced containment suit to Johann's delight. By Johann's own admission, his new suit has changed his life as it feels like a body - so much so that he once even fell asleep and dreamed for the first time since his \\"accident\\". Johann dies when he sacrifices himself to destroy the Ogdru Jahad that landed on Earth. Powers and abilities Kraus possesses the ability to both communicate with spirits and grant them temporary physical forms to allow them to talk with non-mediums. Kraus has limited body possession powers, which enable him to take possession of any form lacking a soul. He has temporarily inhabited the corpses of humans, a dog, and a moose, using them as last-minute containers for his vulnerable form. It was once believed that Johann was vulnerable to psychic attack and his ectoplasm could be taken over by stronger spirits, but it was discovered that he is immune to possession and can take dominance over malevolent spirits - even an Ogdru Hem. The only protection Johann has from dissipation is his B.P.R.D.-built containment suit; once the suit is breached, he must find a new container for his essence or he will cease to exist. In other media Johann Kraus appeared in the 2008 film Hellboy II: The Golden Army.Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) In the film his name is spelled \\"Johann Krauss\\". His character's movements were supplied by British actors John Alexander and James Dodd, and his voice was performed by Seth MacFarlane. Thomas Kretschmann was previously cast for the voice, but was replaced. Krauss is head of the B.P.R.D.'s Ectoplasmic Research division in Washington, D.C., and is sent to the Bureau's headquarters to take command of the team, after Hellboy embarrasses the Bureau and the government by revealing himself to the public. The cause of his condition is not explained, but he hints that it was connected with the loss of the woman he loved - a fianc√©e or a wife, whose ring he still carries around with him. He said that his containment suit was designed by the B.P.R.D.'s former head, Trevor Bruttenholm. According to the film commentary, Guillermo del Toro stated that, in the planned story for the third Hellboy film, Krauss would also have some history with the character of Nazi scientist Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. Krauss immediately strikes Abe Sapien and Tom Manning as knowledgeable and efficient, while Hellboy dislikes him, possibly because he feels overshadowed, and as Hellboy himself says, Johann's name \\"sounds German... I don't like Germans\\", due to his hatred of Nazis. Krauss is punctilious, strait-laced, and scrupulously \\"by-the-book\\". In the commentary, Guillermo del Toro said that he used the character to express his idea of the perfect bureaucrat: lacking a face, body, or any individual identity. This is a departure from the comics version, where Krauss is portrayed as quite compassionate and feeling, often playing an avuncular role towards the rest of the team. Both the comic and film version of Johann can leave their containment suit at will, though it is uncertain how long he can do so without dissipating; once freed from his suit, his ectoplasmic form can physically manipulate objects (as demonstrated when he gives Hellboy a sound thrashing in the B.P.R.D. locker room with a set of locker doors), or can be used for teleplasty (from the Greek œÑŒ∑ŒªŒµ \\"far\\" + œÄŒªŒ±œÉœÑŒµŒπŒΩ \\"to mold or form\\"; the word ectoplasm derives from the same root), enabling him to temporarily reanimate dead creatures and possess mechanical objects or living things. He uses this talent to great effect near the film's climax, when he takes over one of the Golden Army's soldiers and uses it to fight the others. Outside his containment suit, he appears as a roughly humanoid shape in whispy, ghostly form. When Liz Sherman and Abe decide to disobey orders and take the dying Hellboy to Prince Nuada, Krauss initially forbids them to, but reconsiders, remembering his own lost love.

It is a networking technology used in vast, private networks with a great diversity of communication requirements, such as subway systems, pipelines, the mining industry, tunnels and the like (ref). It permits all kinds of applications such as video images, different forms of speech and data traffic, information for process management and the like to be sent flawlessly and transparent over a practically unlimited distance. The system is a mix of Transmission and Access NE, communicating over an optical fiber. The communication protocols include serial protocols (e.g. RS232) as well as telephony (POTS/ISDN), audio, Ethernet, video and video-over-IP (via M-JPEG, MPEG2/4, H.264 or DVB) (ref). Open Transport Network is a brand name and not to be mistaken with Optical Transport Network.  Concept  The basic building block of OTN is called a node. It is a 19\\" frame that houses and interconnects the building blocks that produce the OTN functionality. Core building blocks are the power supply and the optical ring adapter (called BORA : Broadband Optical Ring Adapter) (ref). The remaining node space can be configured with up to 8 (different) layer 1 interfaces as required. OTN nodes are interconnected using pluggable optical fibers in a dual counterrotating ring topology. The primary ring consists of fibers carrying data from node to node in one direction, the secondary ring runs parallel with the primary ring but carries data in the opposite direction. Under normal circumstances, only one ring carries active data. If a failure is detected in this data path, the secondary ring is activated. This hot standby topology results in a 1 + 1 path redundancy. The switchover mechanism is hardware based and results in ultrafast (50ms) switchover without service loss. Virtual bidirectional point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections (services) between identical interfaces in different nodes are programmed via a configuration software called OMS (OTN management system). By doing this, OTN mimics a physical wire harness interconnecting electronic data equipment but with the added advantages typical for fiber transmission and with high reliability due to the intrinsic redundant concept. This concept makes the Open Transport Network the de facto transmission backbone standard for industrial high reliability communication sites that require errorfree communication for a large spectrum of protocols over long distances like pipelines, metros, rail, motorways and industrial sites. The optical rings transport frames with a bitrate of (approximately) 150 Mbit/s (STM-1/OC-3), 622 Mbit/s (STM-4/OC-12), 2.5 Gbit/s (STM-16/OC-48) or 10Gbit/s (STM-64/OC-192). The frames are divided into 32 kb payload cells that carry the service data from source to destination. Via the OTN management system (OMS), as many cells as required by the service are allocated to connections. This bandwidth allocation is transferred to the non-volatile memory of the control boards of the nodes. As a result, the network is able to start up and work without the OMS connected or on line.

There is a station building, the current structure being completed in 2013. History and Description 350px The village community at Capel Bangor was once much larger than it is today, and in the earliest days of the Vale of Rheidol Railway Capel Bangor was the third principal station along with the two termini. It had a resident Station Master, and was equipped with waiting shelters, booking office, passing loop, sidings, and a large carriage shed.Photographs of these facilities, including the Station Master, may be viewed on the County Council website . These facilities were all removed with the gradual decline of the village population, although in the 1980s British Rail, then the operators of this line, rebuilt a stone waiting shelter, and provided a picnic area for passengers alighting from trains here. In 2001 the new operator embarked upon a process of restoration of operating facilities at Capel Bangor. The passing loop was restored, as was a single carriage siding, accessed 'out and back' via a lengthy headshunt. Subsequently, the 1980s waiting shelter was demolished, but the single carriage siding was joined by a second, parallel line (accessed via the same headshunt), and a large modern train shed was constructed.

European Union funding In 2012 a substantial grant from the European Union for infrastructure development in rural communities led to the Vale of Rheidol Railway making substantial investment in its smaller stations. At Capel Bangor this funding allowed for the construction of two raised and surfaced platforms, permitting passengers to join or alight from trains on the level, and also the construction of a station building, based upon one of the station's original structures. Funding also permitted fencing work, and the development of a station garden. The new station building includes an open waiting shelter for passengers, and a station office.

History Dr. Kate Corrigan first appeared in The Wolves of St. August (set in May 1994) as a foil to Hellboy. She is described as a professor of history at New York University (specializing in folklore) before she joined the B.P.R.D. in 1984 as a consultant. She is said to have written sixteen books on folklore and occult history, including the confessions of Isobel Gowdie. In it, she and Hellboy investigated the mass murders in the small European village of Griart. Kate uses her extensive knowledge of folklore to deduce that the village must be St. August and that the killings are being performed by werewolves. She encounters her first ghost on this mission, as well as a werewolf that nearly kills her before being slain by Hellboy. Corrigan was promoted to a regular cast member of B.P.R.D. during the Plague of Frogs arc.

Urban legend of sex bracelets During a resurgence in popularity in 2003, gel bracelets became the subject of a widespread urban legend linking them to a supposed sex game explaining their popularity among young teenagers: they were subsequently dubbed \\"sex bracelets\\". According to rumors, people who wore the jewelry implied they were willing to engage in various acts with whoever pulled them from their wrists; the acts ranged from hugging and kissing to sexual intercourse, and were determined by the bracelet's color. In October 2003, the rumors were prominent enough in Alachua Elementary School in Gainesville, Florida that the principal banned the bracelets to avert disruption and inappropriate comments about them. They were subsequently banned in other schools around Florida and elsewhere. The effectors of these early bans did not insinuate that the rumors were true; however, some later media reports suggested that they may have been,For example, see: generating something of a moral panic. The supposed meanings of the colours of the bands were reported in the British press in 2005. A very similar set of stories surfaced (or re-surfaced) in the British media in 2009, in which the bracelets were allegedly nicknamed shag bands. Similar stories circulated widely in Brazil during the 2009‚Äì2010 summer, where the bracelets were referred to as pulseiras do sexo. In March 2010, a 13-year-old girl in Brazil was raped by three teenage boys after one of them snatched the bracelet she was wearing. The police stated that the crime was motivated by the use of sex bracelets. Different versions associate different colors with sex acts (similar to the handkerchief code). For example, purple might be associated with kissing, red with lapdancing, and black with intercourse. Some versions said the involved action occurs at parties held for the purpose, making them similar to contemporary rumors of \\"rainbow parties\\", a gathering at which groups of girls wearing varying shades of lipstick supposedly take turns fellating their classmates, leaving an array of colors on their penises. Other tales of teenage sex parties have circulated at various times. Folklorist Barbara Mikkelson of snopes.com associates the \\"sex bracelet\\" stories with similar ones of the past. In the 1970s, pulltabs from aluminum cans and labels from beer bottles were supposedly considered \\"sex coupons\\" and obligated any girl presented with one to sleep with the bearer; by the 1990s the rumors shifted to include an assortment of plastic items, including some worn as bracelets. According to Mikkelson, there is likely little truth behind the stories, and the vast majority of teenagers who contact her site express shock and disappointment that so many have believed them. At least one particular type of gel bracelet called the MY Single Band was specifically designed to advertise the wearer's relationship status. The response to this bracelet was largely critical, with Natasha Burton of Cosmopolitan saying she doubted men would look for such a bracelet, given that she was still approached even while wearing her engagement ring. The staff of Glamour were reportedly uncomfortable with the concept, and Eliana Dockterman of Time magazine compared the concept to wearing one's OkCupid profile on one's t-shirt. alt=  See also  Make Poverty History white \\"awareness bracelet\\" * Awareness ribbon ‚Äì developed from 1917 through 1986 to symbolize remembrance of service members and other causes * Gospel bracelet * Lockets and eye miniatures ‚Äì mementos of loved ones c. 1785 **Lock of hair ‚Äì memento dating to antiquity * POW bracelet ‚Äì from 1970 to 1976, engraved with name of an American serviceman captured or missing during the Vietnam War **Memorial bracelet ‚Äì later appearance of bracelets for service members References External links * Guide to wristbands (CBBC Newsround) Symbols 2010s fashion Clothing controversies Bracelets Sexual urban legends 1980s fashion 1990s fads and trends 2000s fads and trends ","title":"Gel bracelet"},{"id":"3502459","text":"Black Mark Production (founded 1991) is an independent record label originally based in Berlin, later on with offices in Stockholm, Toronto and New York City etc. Black Mark Production today is a worldwide operating business placed in Villa Hammerheart, Bruzaholm, Sweden, that specializes in extreme metal releases, perhaps best known for its close connection to Quorthon, leader of the defining black metal band Bathory until his death in 2004.

The prophecy was that the Virgin Mary (referred to as Our Lady of F√°tima), would appear and perform miracles on that date. Newspapers published testimony from witnesses who said that they had seen extraordinary solar activity, such as the Sun appearing to \\"dance\\" or zig-zag in the sky, careen towards the Earth, or emit multicolored light and radiant colors. According to these reports, the event lasted approximately ten minutes. The local bishop opened a canonical investigation of the event in November 1917, to review witness accounts and assess whether the alleged private revelation from Mary were compatible with Catholic theology. The local priest conducting the investigation was particularly convinced by the concurring testimony of extraordinary solar phenomena from secular reporters, government officials, and other skeptics in attendance. Bishop Jos√© da Silva declared the miracle \\"worthy of belief\\" on 13 October 1930, permitting \\"officially the cult of Our Lady of Fatima\\" within the Catholic Church. At a gathering on 13 October 1951 at F√°tima, the papal legate, Cardinal Federico Tedeschini, told the million people attending that on 30 October, 31 October, 1 November, and 8 November 1950, Pope Pius XII himself witnessed the miracle of the Sun from the Vatican gardens.Joseph Pelletier. (1983). The Sun Danced at F√°tima. Doubleday, New York. pp. 147‚Äì151. The early and enduring interest in the miracle and related prophesies has had a significant impact on the devotional practices of many Catholics. There has been much analysis of the event from critical sociological and scientific perspectives. According to critics, the eyewitness testimony was actually a collection of inconsistent and contradictory accounts. Proposed alternative explanations include witnesses being deceived by their senses due to prolonged staring at the Sun and then seeing something unusual as expected. Background Beginning in the spring of 1917, three Catholic shepherd children living near Fatima reported apparitions of an Angel, and starting in May 1917, apparitions of the Virgin Mary, whom the children described as the Lady of the Rosary. The children reported a prophecy that prayer would lead to an end to the Great War, and that on 13 October of that year the Lady would reveal her identity and perform a miracle \\"so that all may believe.\\"De Marchi 1952: 118 Newspapers reported the prophesies, and many pilgrims began visiting the area. The children's accounts were deeply controversial, drawing intense criticism from both local secular and religious authorities. A provisional administrator briefly took the children into custody, believing the prophecies were politically motivated in opposition to the officially secular First Portuguese Republic established in 1910.Bennett, 2012 The event The crowd at Cova da Iria looking towards the Sun on 13 October 1917 Estimates of the number of people present range from 30,000 and 40,000, by Avelino de Almeida writing for the Portuguese newspaper O S√©culo,De Marchi 1952a to 100,000, estimated by lawyer Dr. Jos√© Almeida Garrett, the son of a professor of natural sciences at the University of Coimbra.Donal Anthony Foley.

According to many witnesses, after a period of rain, the dark clouds broke and the Sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It was said to be significantly duller than normal, and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The Sun was then reported to have careened towards the Earth before zig-zagging back to its normal position. Witnesses reported that their previously wet clothes became \\"suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling\\".De Marchi 1952b: 150 Not all witnesses reported seeing the Sun \\"dance\\". Some people only saw the radiant colors, and others, including some believers, saw nothing at all. Names Izabel Brandao de Melo, and a few vague or unverifiable accounts. The only known picture of the Sun taken during the event shows nothing unusual. The three children (L√∫cia dos Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto) who originally claimed to have seen Our Lady of F√°tima also reported seeing a panorama of visions, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people.De Marchi 1952b: 151‚Äì66 In the fourth edition of her memoirs, written in 1941, L√∫cia said that on the occasion of their third visit to the Cova da Iria, on 13 July 1917, she asked the Lady to tell them who she was, and to perform a miracle so that everyone would believe. The Lady told her that they should continue to come to the Cova each month until October, when the requested miracle would occur.Bennett, Jeffrey S., When the Sun Danced: Myth, Miracles, and Modernity in Early Twentieth- Century Portugal, University of Virginia Press, 2012 =De Marchi accounts= Descriptions of the events reported at F√°tima were collected by Father John De Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher.

A shrine was erected near the site in Fatima, which has been attended by thousands of faithful. Pope Pius XII approved the \\"Fatima apparitions\\" in 1940. Four times during the week that he declared the dogma of the Assumption of Mary (33 years after the actual event said to have occurred in Fatima), Pope Pius XII claimed to have witnessed the same \\"Miracle of the Sun\\". At 4:00 pm on 30 October 1950, during a walk in the Vatican gardens, he arrived at the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes and began to see the miracle. He described himself in his handwritten notes as \\"awestruck.\\" He saw the same miracle on 31 October, again on 1 November (the date of the definition of the dogma) and then again on 8 November. He wrote that on other days at about the same time he tried to see if he could observe the Miracle of the Sun, but was unable to. He confided this information to a number of Vatican cardinals, to Sr. Pascalina Lehnert (the nun in charge of the papal apartments) and finally to handwritten notes (discovered in 2008) that were later placed on display at the Vatican. In 2017, Pope Francis approved the recognition of a miracle involving two of the children, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, who were involved in the Fatima event of 1917, which paved the way for their canonization.  Believers' explanations  Within Catholicism, the event is seen as the fulfillment of a promise by Mary, mother of Jesus to the shepherd children she appeared to several times before 13 October 1917. According to the children's accounts, Mary, referred to as the Lady of F√°tima, promised them she would perform a miracle to show people they were telling the truth, and so caused the crowds to see the Sun make \\"incredible\\" movements in the sky. Catholics have regarded Mary as a \\"miracle worker\\" for centuries, and this view has continued into the 21st century.Miracles of Our Lady by Gonzalo de Berceo, Richard Terry Mount, Annette Grant Cash 1997 pp. 6‚Äì7 Various theologians and apologetic scientists have discussed the limits of scientific explanations for the event and proposed possible mechanisms through which divine intervention caused the solar phenomenon. Fr Andrew Pinsent, research director of the Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion at Oxford University, states that \\"a scientific perspective does not rule out miracles, and the event at Fatima is, in the view of many, particularly credible.\\" He states that a usual prejudice involves a lack of understanding of the scope of scientific laws, which merely describe how natural systems behave isolated from free agents. Concluding that the event is \\"a public miracle of the most extraordinary kind and credibility\\", he sees the year of the event, as connected to significant historical milestones that call for Fatima's message of repentance: Protestantism in 1517, Freemasonry in 1717 and Atheistic Communism in 1917. Theologian, professor, and priest Stanley L. Jaki, concurs, concluding that by divine intervention, a coordinated interplay of natural meteorological events, an enhancement of air lens with ice crystals, was made to occur at the exact time predicted, and this is the essence of the miracle. He assumed as fact that the Sun didn't move since observatories did not perceive any solar movement and the vast majority of the Earth's populace didn't notice it either. Jaki described the phenomenon thus: :...a sudden temperature inversion must have taken place. The cold and warm air masses could conceivably propel that rotating air lens in an elliptical orbit first toward the earth, and then push it up, as if it were a boomerang, back to its original position. Meanwhile the ice crystals in it acted as so many means of refraction for the sun‚Äôs rays... Only one observer, a lawyer, stated three decades later that the path of descent and ascent was elliptical with small circles superimposed on it. Such an observation would make eminent sense to anyone familiar with fluid dynamics or even with the workings of a boomerang. There is indeed plenty of scientific information on hand to approach the miracle of the sun scientifically... The carefully co-ordinated interplay of so many physical factors would by itself be a miracle, even if one does not wish to see anything more in what actually happened. Clearly, the \\"miracle\\" of the sun was not a mere meteorological phenomenon, however rare. Otherwise it would have been observed before and after, regardless of the presence of devout crowds or not. I merely claim, which I did in my other writings on miracles, that in producing miracles God often makes use of a natural substratum by greatly enhancing its physical components and their interactions. According to Jaki, the faithful should believe that a miracle occurred at Fatima, and \\"those who stake their purpose in life on Christ as the greatest and incomparably miraculous fact of history\\", need to pay attention to facts that support miracles. Father De Marchi believed related miraculous phenomena, such as the Sun's effect on standing water from heavy rains that immediately preceded the event, to be genuine. According to De Marchi, \\"...engineers that have studied the case reckoned that an incredible amount of energy would have been necessary to dry up those pools of water that had formed on the field in a few minutes as it was reported by witnesses.\\" De Marchi wrote that the prediction of an unspecified \\"miracle\\", the abrupt beginning and end of the event, the varied religious backgrounds of the observers, the sheer numbers of people present, reports of sightings by people up to away, and the lack of any known scientific causative factor make a mass hallucination or mass hysteria unlikely.(De Marchi 1952b: 150, 278‚Äì82) De Marchi concludes that \\"given the indubitable reference to God, and the general context of the story, it seems that we must attribute to Him alone the most obvious and colossal miracle of history.\\" Leo Madigan, a former psychiatric nurse and local journalist at F√°tima in the late 20th century, also dismisses suggestions from critics of mass hypnosis, and believes that astonishment, fear, exaltation and the spiritual nature of the phenomenon explain any inconsistency of witnesses descriptions. Madigan wrote that what people saw was \\"the reflection of the Lady's own light projected on the Sun itself\\". Criticism parhelion in rainbow colors, photographed in 2005 Theologians, scientists, and skeptics have responded to claims that conflict with established scientific knowledge regarding the behavior of the Sun. Science writer Benjamin Radford maintains that \\"the sun did not really dance in the sky. We know this because, of course, everyone on Earth is under the same sun, and if the closest dying star to us suddenly began doing celestial gymnastics a few billion other people would surely have reported it\\". Radford wrote that psychological factors such as the power of suggestion and pareidolia can better explain the reported events. According to Radford, \\"No one suggests that those who reported seeing the Miracle of the Sun‚Äîor any other miracles at F√°tima or elsewhere‚Äîare lying or hoaxing. Instead, they very likely experienced what they claimed to, though that experience took place mostly in their minds.\\" Radford also responds to the claims regarding the sudden drying up of water by pointing out that it is not clear, and photography from the time of the event does not show, that it had been raining as much or as long as was reported. In The Evidence for Visions of the Virgin Mary Kevin McClure wrote that the crowd at Cova da Iria may have been expecting to see signs in the Sun, since similar phenomena had been reported in the weeks leading up to the miracle. On this basis, he believes that the crowd saw what it wanted to see. McClure also stated that he had never seen such a collection of contradictory accounts of a case in any of the research that he had done in the previous ten years. According to theologian Lisa J. Schwebel, claims of the miracle present a number of difficulties. Schwebel states, \\"not only did all those present not see the phenomenon, but also there are considerable inconsistencies among witnesses as to what they did see\\". Schwebel also observes that there is no authentic photo of the solar phenomena claimed, \\"despite the presence of hundreds of reporters and photographers at the field\\" and one photo often presented as authentic is actually \\"a solar eclipse in another part of the world taken sometime before 1917\\".Lisa J. Schwebel. Apparitions, Healings, and Weeping Madonnas: Christianity and the Paranormal. Paulist Press; 2014. . pp. 2‚Äì. There is some evidence to the effect that the miracle was expected by witnesses. The witness Joaquim Gregorio Tavares, who was present at Fatima on October 13th, states, \\"We must declare that, although we admit the possibility of some miraculous fact, we were there while having in mind conversations we had earlier with cool-headed persons who were anticipating some changes of colour in the Sun\\" The villagers in Alburitel were preparing for a Sun miracle too. According to Maria do Carmo, \\"It was anticipated that the miracle would involve the stars\\". This is likely due to the fact that in the months of July, August and September people at Fatima claimed the Sun's light dimmed and the sky became dark enough for stars to become visible. This was denied too by many witnesses from the previous months. She also states that on the morning of October 13th, \\"the people of Alburitel were darkening bits of glass by exposing them to candle-smoke so that they might watch the Sun, with no harm to their eyes.\\" Supernatural explanations, such as those by Father Pio Scatizzi, who argues that observers in F√°tima could not be collectively deceived, or that the effect was not seen by observatories in distant places because of divine interventionDe Marchi 1952b:282 have been dismissed by critics who say those taking part in the event could certainly be deceived by their senses, or they could have experienced a localized, natural phenomenon. Others, such as professor of physics Auguste Meessen, suggest that optical effects created by the human eye can account for the reported phenomenon. Meessen presented his analysis of apparitions and \\"Miracles of the Sun\\" at the International Symposium \\"Science, Religion and Conscience\\" in 2003.Hallet, M. (2011) Les apparitions de la Vierge et la critique historique (new expanded edition)Apparitions and Miracles of the Sun. Auguste Meessen. International Forum in Porto \\"Science, Religion and Conscience\\" October 23‚Äì25, 2003 Meessen.net While Meessen felt those who claim to have experienced miracles were \\"honestly experiencing what they report\\", he stated Sun miracles cannot be taken at face value and that the reported observations were optical effects caused by prolonged staring at the Sun. Meessen contends that retinal after- images produced after brief periods of Sun gazing are a likely cause of the observed dancing effects. Similarly, Meessen concluded that the color changes witnessed were most likely caused by the bleaching of photosensitive retinal cells.Auguste Meessen 'Apparitions and Miracles of the Sun' International Forum in Porto \\"Science, Religion and Conscience\\" 23‚Äì25 October 2003 Shortly after the miracle, the Catholic lawyer named Coelho said in his article that he returned to Fatima with his friends the day after and saw the exact same motions and colour changes in the Sun. He says, \\"One doubt remained with us however. Was what we saw in the Sun an exceptional thing? Or could it be reproduced in analogous circumstances? Now it was precisely this analogy of circumstances that presented itself to us yesterday [Sunday]. We could see the Sun half overcast as on Saturday. And sincerely, we saw on that day the same succession of colors, the same rotary movement, etc.\\" Meessen observes that Sun Miracles have been witnessed in many places where religiously charged pilgrims have been encouraged to stare at the Sun. He cites the apparitions at Heroldsbach, Germany (1949) as an example, where many people within a crowd of over 10,000 testified to witnessing similar observations as at F√°tima. Meessen also cites a British Journal of Ophthalmology article that discusses some modern examples of Sun Miracles.\\"Solar retinopathy following religious rituals\\". M Hope-Ross, S Travers, D Mooney; Br J Ophthalmol 1988, 72: 931‚Äì934 Prof. Dr. St√∂ckl, a meteorologist from Regensburg, also proposed a similar theory and made similar observations. Critics also suggest that a combination of clouds, atmospheric effects and natural sunlight could have created the reported visual phenomena. Steuart Campbell, writing for the edition of Journal of Meteorology in 1989, postulated that a cloud of stratospheric dust changed the appearance of the Sun on 13 October, making it easy to look at, and causing it to appear to be yellow, blue, and violet, and to spin. In support of his hypothesis, Mr. Campbell reported that a blue and reddened Sun was reported in China as documented in 1983.\\"F√°tima's dusty veil\\", New Humanist, Vol 104, No 2, August 1989 and \\"The Miracle of the Sun at F√°tima\\", Journal of Meteorology, UK, Vol 14, no. 142, October 1989 Paul Simons, in an article entitled \\"Weather Secrets of Miracle at F√°tima\\", stated that it is possible that some of the optical effects at F√°tima may have been caused by a cloud of dust from the Sahara.\\"Weather Secrets of Miracle at F√°tima\\", Paul Simons, The Times, 17 February 2005. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell wrote that the \\"dancing sun\\" effects reported at F√°tima were \\"a combination of factors, including optical effects and meteorological phenomena, such as the sun being seen through thin clouds, causing it to appear as a silver disc. Other possibilities include an alteration in the density of the passing clouds, causing the sun‚Äôs image to alternately brighten and dim and so seem to advance and recede, and dust or moisture droplets in the atmosphere refracting the sunlight and thus imparting a variety of colors\\". Nickell also suggests that unusual visual effects could have resulted from temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, or have been caused by a sundog, a relatively common atmospheric optical phenomenon. Nickell also highlights the psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, noting that devout spectators often come to locations where Marian apparitions have been reported \\"fully expecting some miraculous event\\", such as the 1988 Lubbock apparition of Mary in Texas, the Mother Cabrini Shrine near Denver, Colorado, in 1992, and Conyers, Georgia, in the early to mid-1990s.

It was later shown that the two Catholics were actually in prison when the alleged offense took place. Regardless, Jones was arrested, severely tortured and scourged. Topcliffe then took Jones to his house where he was further tortured, \\"To him (Topcliffe) was granted the privilege, unique in the laws of England, or, perhaps, of any country, of maintaining a private rack in his own home for the more convenient examination of prisoners.\\"Waugh, Evelyn, Edmund Campion, Longmans, Green and Co. 1935, p. 110 Following his torture, Jones was imprisoned for nearly two years. During this time Jones helped sustain John Rigby in his faith, who later also became one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. On 3 July 1598 Father Jones was tried on the charge of \\"going over the seas in the first year of Her majesty's reign (1558) and there being made a priest by the authority from Rome and then returning to England contrary to statute\\".

Like Margaret Clitherow, Wiseman refused to enter a plea and was therefore condemned to the peine forte et dure, although she was eventually pardoned. =Execution= As by this time the people had grown tired of these butcheries, the execution was arranged for an early hour in the morning. The place was St. Thomas's Watering, a small bridge over the Neckinger crossing the Old Kent Road, at the site of the junction of the old Roman road to London with the main line of Watling Street. This marked the boundary of the City of London's authority; it was also a place of gibbets. The execution was delayed by about an hour because the hangman forgot to bring a rope. Jones used the time to preach to the people and answer their questions. Butler, Alban. Butler's Lives of the Saints. Revised ed. Collegeville: Burns & Oats, 2000, p. 89 When the time came to draw away the cart, the hangman whipped the horses; but they were held back by three or four fellows till Jones had finished what he was saying. John Jones' dismembered remains were fixed atop poles on roads leading to Newington and Lambeth (now represented by Tabard Street and Lambeth Road respectively). His remains were later reputedly removed by at least two Catholic Englishmen, one of whom suffered a long imprisonment for this offense. One of the relics eventually reached Pontoise, where Jones had taken his religious vows.

Situated downstream from Kinsale on the River Bandon, the fort was built to defend the harbour and seaborne approaches of the town. Following the construction of Charles Fort on the opposite side of the harbour in the late 17th century, James Fort became known as the \\"old fort\\" (). Listed as a protected National Monument, and managed by the Office of Public Works, the fort is open to visitors. History The waterfront blockhouse Before James fort was constructed, an earlier medieval fortification existed on the site. This fortification, named Castle Ny-Parke was occupied for a time by Spanish forces during the early part of the Siege of Kinsale (1601). It was captured however from the Spanish by Sir Richard Smyth who led the attacking English forces of Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy. Construction of James Fort commenced in 1602 - immediately after the Siege of Kinsale. The fort was named after James I of England and VI of Scotland, and was built to designs by Paul Ive (to replace and supplement the older medieval structure). Completed by 1607, the central structure was a half-bastioned four-sided stone fortification, surrounded by pentagonal earthworks to a bastion fort or star-shaped fort design. A hexagonal blockhouse was built on the water's edge - a water battery at the narrowest point in the channel. As with Charles Fort on the other side of the harbour, James Fort was occupied by Jacobite forces during the Williamite War in Ireland. It was captured however in 1690 by Williamite forces, after being damaged by an explosion of gunpowder stores. Though Charles Fort (the \\"new fort\\") was operated as a military garrison through to the early 20th century, James Fort (the \\"old fort\\") declined in use during the 18th century, and texts and maps describe it as a ruin by the 19th century. Today James Fort was subject to a number of archaeological excavations in the late 20th and early 21st centuries - including a survey commissioned by D√∫chas (the Heritage Service) in 1998. The fort site is listed as a National Monument (number 525), and as such under \\"state guardianship\\". As of 2016, An Taisce (the National Trust for Ireland) listed the fort in an \\"at risk\\" category, noting that while it had been subject to preservation works, it required \\"a long-term conservation management plan to prevent future deterioration\\". The James Fort site is publicly accessible, and visited both as a tourist attraction and as an amenity park (by walkers and runners).

It prevents shops over 280 m¬≤/3,000 sq ft from opening on Christmas Day in England and Wales. Shops smaller than the limit are not affected. The Act was introduced to the House of Commons by Kevan Jones, MP for North Durham as a Private Member's Bill on 7 January 2004. The aim of the Act was to keep Christmas Day a \\"special\\" day, whereby all major retailers would be closed. Although it was traditional for major retailers to close on 25 December, some retailers, such as Woolworths, began to open some stores in the late 1990s. Both religious groups and shop worker unions were against the idea of Christmas openings, leading to pressure on the Government to pass legislation to prevent the practice.

These application specific databases are required because general purpose databases have historically not provided enough performance for EDA applications. In examining EDA design databases, it is useful to look at EDA tool architecture, to determine which parts are to be considered part of the design database, and which parts are the application levels. In addition to the database itself, many other components are needed for a useful EDA application. Associated with a database are one or more language systems (which, although not directly part of the database, are used by EDA applications such as parameterized cells and user scripts). On top of the database are built the algorithmic engines within the tool (such as timing, placement, routing, or simulation engines ), and the highest level represents the applications built from these component blocks, such as floorplanning. The scope of the design database includes the actual design, library information, technology information, and the set of translators to and from external formats such as Verilog and GDSII. Mature design databases Many instances of mature design databases exist in the EDA industry, both as a basis for commercial EDA tools as well as proprietary EDA tools developed by the CAD groups of major electronics companies. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, SDA Systems and ECAD (now Cadence Design Systems), High Level Design Systems, and many other companies developed EDA specific databases over the last 20 years, and these continue to be the basis of IC-design systems today. Many of these systems took ideas from university research and successfully productized them. Most of the mature design databases have evolved to the point where they can represent netlist data, layout data, and the ties between the two. They are hierarchical to allow for reuse and smaller designs. They can support styles of layout from digital through pure analog and many styles of mixed-signal design. Current design databases =The OpenAccess design database= Given the importance of a common design database in the EDA industry, the OpenAccess Coalition has been formed to develop, deploy, and support an open-sourced EDA design database with shared control. The data model presented in the OA DB provides a unified model that currently extends from structural RTL through GDSII-level mask data, and now into the reticle and wafer space. It provides a rich enough capability to support digital, analog, and mixed-signal design data. It provides technology data that can express foundry process design rules through at least 20 nm, contains the definitions of the layers and purposes used in the design, definitions of VIAs and routing rules, definitions of operating points used for analysis, and so on. OA makes extensive use of IC-specific data compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint, to address the size, capacity, and performance problems of previous DBs. As of 2007, OA is the only modern IC database where the implementation is publicly available. =Synopsys Milkyway= The Milkyway database was originally developed by Avanti Corporation, which has since been acquired by Synopsys. It was first released in 1997. Milkyway is the database underlying most of Synopsys' physical design tools: * IC Compiler and Astro physical synthesis * Star-RCXT RC parasitic extractor * Hercules LVS/DRC physical verification Milkyway stores topological, parasitic and timing data. Having been used to design thousands of chips, Milkyway is very stable and production worthy. Milkyway is known to be written in C. Its internal implementation is not available outside Synopsys, so no comments may be made about the implementation. MDX C-API At the request of large customers such as Texas Instruments, Avanti released the MDX C-API in 1998. This enables the customers' CAD developers to create plugins that add custom functionality to Milkyway tools (chiefly Astro). MDX allows fairly complete access to topological data in Milkyway, but does not support timing or RC parasitic data. MAP-in Program In early 2003, Synopsys (which acquired Avanti) opened Milkyway through the Milkyway Access Program (MAP-In). Any EDA company may become a MAP-in member for free (Synopsys customers must use MDX). Members are provided the means to interface their software to Milkyway using C, Tcl, or Scheme. The Scheme interface is deprecated in favor of TCL. IC Compiler supports only TCL. The MAP-in C-API enables a non-Synopsys application to read and write Milkyway databases. Unlike MDX, MAP-in does not permit the creation of a plugin that can be used from within Synopsys Milkyway tools. MAP-in does not support access to timing or RC parasitic data. MAP-in also lacks direct support of certain geometric objects. MAP-in includes Milkyway Development Environment (MDE). MDE is a GUI application used to develop TCL and Scheme interfaces and diagnose problems. Its major features include: * Graphical editor for viewing and editing Milkyway databases * TCL command interpreter * Scheme command interpreter * Translators to read and write popular formats like Verilog, LEF, DEF and GDSII =Falcon from Mentor= Another significant design database is Falcon, from Mentor Graphics. This database was one of the first in the industry written in C++. Like Milkyway is for Synopsys, Falcon seems to be a stable and mature platform for Mentor‚Äôs IC products. Again, the implementation is not publicly available, so little can be said about its features or performance relative to other industry standards. =Magma's database= Magma Design Automation‚Äôs database is not just a disk format with an API, but is an entire system built around their DB as a central data structure. Again, since the details of the system are not publicly available, a direct comparison of features or performance is not possible. Looking at the capabilities of the Magma tools would indicate that this DB has a similar functionality to OpenAccess, and may be capable of representing behavioral (synthesis input) information. Major features of an EDA specific database An EDA specific database is expected to provide many basic constructs and services.

A four-door crossover sport-utility vehicle, the Meta One made its debut at the 2005 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. The Meta One is notable for being the first concept vehicle designed with a PZEV diesel-hybrid powertrain.\\"Mercury Meta One Concept Vehicle.\\" Ford Motor Company. February 4, 2007  Design  Loosely based upon the body of the production Ford Freestyle, the Mercury Meta One was a luxury crossover SUV with four seats. Serving as a testbed for in-vehicle technology, the Meta One featured an always-on Wi-Fi connection; along with the ability to connect handheld devices and the built in Sirius Satellite Radio, it also allowed the on-board navigation system to deliver real-time updates for traffic and route conditions. Instead of a traditional instrument panel, the vehicle featured multiple computer displays that were reconfigurable to fit driver needs. A special design for the smart key allowed it to double as a PDA, allowing it to also store emergency contacts. In collaboration with Volvo, the Mercury Meta One was designed with a number of safety technologies unseen on a production Ford Motor Company vehicle. These included lane departure control and collision mitigation by pre-charging the brakes if an on-board camera and radar sensor senses the likelihood of an accident.  Powertrain  The Meta One was powered by a 248 hp twin-turbocharged diesel V6; the 2.7L engine was sourced from the Australian Ford Territory (sized similar to the Freestyle) and the Land Rover Discovery product lines. Coupled with the continuously variable transmission (as used in the Freestyle) was an electric motor, providing start-stop technology to increase fuel economy. The combined torque output of the powertrain was ; it was 97% cleaner than the Tier I emissions standard for NOx . While the technology has not been applied to diesel engines, the Ford EcoBoost family of gasoline engines has utilized turbocharging in the same manner in the effort to lower emissions while increasing power. In place of a traditional V8 engine, the Ford Taurus SHO and Lincoln MKS utilize a 365 hp twin-turbocharged V6.  Fate  Although sharing the architecture of the Ford Freestyle, the Meta One was not released as a production vehicle.Neff, John. \\"UPDATE: Mercury Meta One not happening.\\" AutoBlog, October 20, 2006. February 4, 2007 . In late 2006, during the development of the Ford Taurus X, prototype development mules were spotted using front bodywork of Meta One prototypes, leading to speculation that the Mercury division would be given a production form of the Meta One, possibly named either the Mercury Monticello or Mercury Magellan. As with its Ford Freestyle predecessor, the Ford Taurus X reached production without a Mercury (or Lincoln) counterpart. The Meta One's current location, or if it still exists, is unknown.

It is a jungle filled region that is sparsely populated. More than 180 sanctuaries were found in a protected area of . Only about two dozen monuments can be visited by tourists because most of the sanctuaries are hidden in the forest and the whole area is not fully demined. Koh Ker is the modern name for an important city of the Khmer empire. In inscriptions the town is mentioned as Lingapura (city of lingams) or Chok GargyarHigham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, (translated as city of glance, or as iron tree forest). Under the reign of the kings Jayavarman IV and Harshavarman II Koh Ker was briefly the capital of the whole empire (928-944 AD). Jayavarman IV enforced an ambitious building program. An enormous water-tank and about forty temples were constructed under his rule. The most significant templecomplex, a double sanctuary (Prasat Thom/Prang), follows a linear plan and not a concentric one like most of the temples of the Khmer kings. Unparalleled is the -high seventiered pyramid, which most probably served as state temple of Jayavarman IV. Really impressive too are the shrines with the twometer high lingas. Under Jayavarman IV, the style of Koh Ker was developed and the art of sculpture reached a pinnacle. A great variety of statues were chiseled. Because of its remoteness, the site of Koh Ker was plundered many times by looters. Sculptures of Koh Ker can be found not only in different museums, but also in private collections. Masterpieces of Koh Ker are offered occasionally at auctions. These pieces, in present times, are considered stolen art. The site is about two and half hours away from Siem Reap, and guests cana stay in the nearby village of Seyiong, 10 kms from the temples where there is a number of guests houses. Travellers can also stay in Koh Ker Jungle Lodge Homestay, a sustainable tourism project built in the village of Koh Ker in 2009, by booking in advance of arrival. The Koh Ker community in May 2019 open a basic wooden community rest house in the village. Since 1992 the site of Koh Ker is on the UNESCO tentative world heritage list. Geography Koh Ker is situated between the southern slopes of the Dangrek mountains, the Kulen mountains (Phnom Kulen) in the south-west, and the Tbeng mountain (Phnom Tbeng, near Tbeng Meanchey) in the east. Most parts of the hilly ground are covered by jungle, but most of the trees shed their leaves seasonally. The city of Koh Ker was on the most important strategic route of the Khmer empire. Coming from Angkor and Beng Mealea to Koh Ker this road led to Prasat Preah Vihear and from there to Phimai in Thailand and Wat Phu in Laos . The region of Koh Ker is relatively dry. Numerous water-tanks and canals were built during the 9th and the 10th century to ensure the water supply. These days water is pumped up from a depth of meters. History =Jayavarman IV= Jayavarman IV ruled from 928 to 941 at Koh Ker. He was a believed to have been the local king at this remote site, possibly his homeland, before he became king of the whole empire. That could explain why he had his residence at Koh Ker and not at Roluos (Hariharalaya) or at Yashodharapura (Angkor) like the kings before him. Some historians think that Jayavarman IV was an usurper; but, the majority of them believe that he was a legitimate ruler who could ascend to the throne because he married a half-sister of king Yasovarman I (889 ‚Äì 900). What is certain is that the two sons of Yasovarman I (Harshavarman I, who ruled from 900 to 922 and Isanavarman II, who ruled from 922 to 925?) had no children. In the short time that Jayavarman IV reigned in Koh Ker, an ambitious building program was realised. That was only possible because of a restrictive system of raising taxes as seen on inscriptions found at the site. About 40 temples, the unique seven-tiered pyramid and a huge baray (water-reservoir) were built. Under Jayavarman IV, the Koh Ker-style was developed and the art of sculpture reached a pinnacle. =Harshavarman II= After the death of Jayavarman IV, the designated prince became did not take his place. Harshavarman II (another son of Jayavarman IV) claimed the throne. Like his father, he ruled at Koh Ker (941 ‚Äì 944) but after three years he died; likely not due to natural causes. None of the temples at Koh Ker can be ascribed to him. His follower on the throne, a cousin of his, returned Roluos (Hariharalaya) to the seat of power. =Koh Ker after 944 AD= Even after 944, as the capital of the Khmer Empire had changed back to the plains north of the Tonle Sap-lake, more temples were built at the site of Koh Ker. An inscription mentions the reign of Udayadityavarman I in 1001. At the beginning of the 13th century the last sanctuary was realised there. Under Jayavarman VII, the Prasat Andong Kuk, a so-called hospital-chapel, was built, one of more than 100 of hospital- sanctuaries built under this ruler. History of research =19th century= In the second part of the 19th century, French adventurers ranged the forests around the site of Koh Ker while hunting game. They brought word of the structures in the area back to France. The French researchers Lunet de Lajonqui√®re and √âtienne Aymonier came to Koh Ker. They saw the main temple- complex Prasat Thom/Prang, the Baray and a group of linga-shrines. They also discovered a few subsections of a chauss√©e (i.e. highway) with a breadth of more than . They supposed that a road once connected Koh Ker with Wat Phu (today in southern Laos). Around 1880, members of a French expedition arrived at Koh Ker and looted numerous statues and reliefs. These pieces are now in the Mus√©e Guimet in Paris. =20th century= At the beginning of the 20th century, art historians realised that a full-fledged style was developed at Koh Ker. Georges Coed√®s concluded from inscriptions that Koh Ker was capital of the Khmer empire (928 ‚Äì 944 AD) under the reign of Jayavarman IV and his follower Harshavarman II. In the 1930s, again French researchers came to Koh Ker. They discovered numerous monuments and counted fifty sanctuaries in an area of . Henry Parmentier made a number of drawings. After an interruption because of the reign of terror of the Khmer rouge, research at Koh Ker continued by APSARA, French, Japanese and Australian scientists. =21st century= At the beginning of the 21st century, scientists concluded that not all of the monuments could have been built in the short time when Koh Ker was capital of the Khmer empire (928 ‚Äì 944 AD). A new era started at Koh Ker as photographs made by satellites were analysed. In 2004 the protected area was extended to . For five years, Japanese researchers explored and described 184 monuments, including documenting their exact locations. The Australian researcher Damian Evans and his team were able to verify Lajonqui√®re's theory that there once was a Khmer route between Koh Ker and Wat Phu, probably the most important strategic road of the Khmer empire. Excavations in December 2015 by Cambodian and international teams near Prasat Thom and the Rahal in the ancient urban core area of Koh Ker have yielded radiocarbon dates that clearly place significant habitation and activity beginning as early as the 7th-8th centuries CE - often noted as the Chenla period by historians. Some pottery types may date to the earlier Funan period. Over 24,000 artifacts and ecofacts were recovered from three test sites. Artifacts are mostly pottery fragments with local and exotic types representing over 1000 years of site use throughout the occupational sequence. Exotic pottery types include Chinese stoneware and glazed ware from the Song Yuan periods. Other exotic pottery include Thai and Vietnamese stoneware that generally date to the late Angkor and post-Angkor periods. Possible Persian pottery dating to the 9th century has been noted as well. Thus, Koh Ker has been linked to long distance value chains for considerable time spans. Although the area may have been significantly repurposed during the 10th century construction-boom heyday of Jayavarman IV, site use and activity continued well beyond the 10th century. Intensity of activities and density of occupation may have oscillated over time in relation to political and socio-economic factors. Natural and human resource management variables as well as environmental phenomena may have also played significant roles related to changes in popularity, population and productivity. The project is part of the Nalanda - Sriwijaya Centre (NSC) Field School led by Dr. D. Kyle Latinis (NSC) and Dr. Ea Darith (APSARA National Authority) with further support from the National Authority for Preah Vihear (NAPV). Religion Before Koh Ker became capital of the Khmer empire (928 AD), numerous sanctuaries with Shiva-lingas existed already. Koh Ker was a cult site where Shiva had been worshipped a long time. Also Jayavarman IV was an ardent worshipper of this Hindu god. As later kings (whose residence was not in Koh Ker) changed from Hinduism to Buddhism they gave orders to make the necessary adjustments at their temples. Because of its remoteness, the sanctuaries at Koh Ker were spared from these interventions. Inscriptions Several inscriptions were found which mention Koh Ker as capital of the empire in Siem Reap, Battambang, Takeo and Kampong Cham (city).A short guide to the temples of Koh Ker, Heritage Watch, p. 7 From inscriptions discovered at Koh Ker, it is estimated that more than ten thousand people lived at Koh Ker when it was the capital (928 ‚Äì 944 AD). The inscriptions explain how manpower was organised: taxes in form of rice were raised in the whole country and served to provide for the workers who came from different provinces. An inscription at Prasat Damrei says that the shrine on the top of the state temple (Prang) houses a lingam of about and that the erection of this Shiva-symbol gave a lot of problems\\". A Sanskrit inscription at Prasat Thom gives evidence of the consecration of a Shiva-lingam 921 AD which was worshipped under the name of Tribhuvaneshvara (\\"Lord of the Threefold World\\"). Style of Koh Ker None of the immense, expressive and beautiful sculptures are left at the site. Numerous of them were stolen and are standing now in museums and also in private collections. Some statues were put away by government organizations to protect them from looters. Many masterpieces of Koh Ker are now in the collection of the National Museum in Phnom Penh. In late 2011, the remote location drew media attention worldwide when Sotheby's attempted to sell a statue of a mythical Khmer Empire warrior. In March 2012, the US and Cambodian governments filed court documents to seize the statue that they purport was illegally removed from the site. A twin statue, also linked to the Koh Ker site, is on display at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California. Ancient city Koh Ker The center of the ancient city was in the north-east corner of the baray (water-tank). Inscriptions say at least ten thousand inhabitants lived there during the rule of Jayavarman IV. Past researchers believed a square wall with a side length of protected the town. But new research indicates that the linear structures found in this part of Koh Ker were dykes of ancient canals. Concerning the wooden buildings of the Khmer time no artefacts are found. Laterite, sandstone and brick were used as construction materials in Koh Ker. Laterite and sandstone of excellent quality were quarried in great quantities in the region of Koh Ker, so the transport of the stones to the site was no problem. The bricks produced were small, regular and very solid. A thin layer of organic mortar of unknown formula was used, possibly some form of plant sap. After more than a millennium the brick sanctuaries in Koh Ker are in a much better condition than the laterite ones. The roofs of some temples in Koh Ker had a wood construction and were covered with tiles. In these monuments, holes for the wooden girders are found. The main sanctuary (the temple-complex Prasat Thom/Prang) was not standing in the middle of the ancient city. Water-Tanks =Rahal= The huge Baray (water- tank) called Rahal is the largest object at the site of the ancient capital Koh Ker. Its length is about and its breath about . The water-tank has three dams covered by steps of laterite. The orientation of the Rahal is not from east to west like the huge water-reservoirs in Angkor; it follows an orientation of North 15¬∞ West. Because the most important monuments at Koh Ker have the same orientation it is thought that the Baray was constructed first and the rest of the structures were laid out around it. The Rahal was carved out partly of the stone ground but it's not clear if a natural hollow was the reason for its orientation. These days most parts of the Baray are dried out and covered by grass. Some puddles can be seen in the corner next to the double-sanctuary.Csaba K√†das: Koh Ker, Shortguide, Hunincor 2010, , S. 31, =Trapeang Andong Preng= south of the double-sanctuary Prasat Thom/Prang is a basin dug into the earth with a length of . It has steps of laterite on all sides. During the rainy season the water is standing to a depth of . The Trapeang Andong Preng does not belong to a temple, but it could have been a royal bath, because near this place was once the wooden palace of the king. =Trapeang Khnar= (carvings) Temples and shrines =Complex of the double sanctuary Prasat Thom/Prang= Linear plan The complex of the main monument in Koh Ker has a linear plan and is about long. Its orientation is E15¬∞N, that is parallel to the Baray. The parking area cuts the complex in two parts. On the east side of the parking are two structures, called palaces. On the west side are the other monuments. They are standing behind the restaurants and are from east to west: an immense entrance pavilion, two towers, a red brick entrance-tower (Prasat Krahom), a surrounding wall with two courts (in the eastern court is the temple-complex Prasat Thom with a moat, in the western court stands the seven tiered pyramid, named Prang). Behind the enclosure is an artificial hill, the socalled Tomb of the White Elephant. Except the Prasat Krahom and the Prang (pyramid). This temple- complex is in a bad condition. Palaces At the east side of the parking area are two structures the so-called palaces. Each consists of four rectangular buildings surrounding a court. All eight buildings have three rooms, some have a patio with pillars. Possibly these palaces served as meditation- or prayer-rooms for the king or nobles. Entrance pavilion and laterite towers Between the palaces and the closest monument is a distance of . On the left side of the parking area (behind the restaurants) is the entrance pavilion made of sandstone. It stands away from the double sanctuary and has a cruciform ground-plan. The crossbar is long; the stringer has a length of . Parallel to the cross-bar are two halls. Directly behind the entrance-pavilion are the ruins of two huge laterite towers. Prasat Krahom Behind the ruins of the entrance-pavilion and the laterite towers is a red brick tower, called Prasat Krahom (krahom = red), which gives entrance to the enclosed monuments. It has a cruciform plan, is in a good condition and once housed a statue of the Dancing Shiva with five heads and ten arms. The sculpture had a height of , but is now broken completely. A fragment of a hand of can be seen in the National Museum in Phnom Penh. Outer enclosure The outer enclosure has a length of and a breadth of An additional wall divides the inner area in two. In the eastern court are a moat and the temple-complex Prasat Thom; in the western court is the pyramid, called Prang. The eastern court with a length of is nearly square, the western court has a length of . Moat The moat in the eastern court is about wide. It borders the Prasat Thom. Lined by trees it looks very picturesque. Two dams, one at the east side, the other at the west side are leading to the ground within the moat. The dams are flanked by Naga-balustrades. On the eastern dam between the Nagas was additionally a colonnade with pillars. Behind each Naga of the east side was standing a huge Garuda. Prasat Thom Probably some parts of the Prasat Thom including the moat and the 1. (inner) enclosure were built before 921 AD. The sanctuary was expanded under the reign of Jayavarman IV and has now two surrounding walls inside of the moat. The first wall (inner wall) is made of brick; the second wall (outer wall) with a length of and a breath of is made of laterite. Two doors are in the east and in the west. The doors of the second wall have a cruciform plan. The doors of the first wall are smaller and not of cruciform layout. The plane between the first and second wall is completely overbuilt with rectangular structures, possibly later additions. In the center court is the sanctuary and opposite it are two socalled libraries. Behind the sanctuary on a rectangular platform stand nine towers in two rows (one of five, one four towers). Twelve smaller prasats in groups of three surround the platform. All 21 towers once housed lingas. Prang The seventiered pyramid called Prang was probably the state temple of Jayavarman IV. Construction of the sanctuary was started in 928 AD. At ground level one, side of the square building measures . The height is . Originally on the top platform stood a huge lingam probably more than high and having a weight of several tons. Inscriptions say that it was the tallest and most beautiful Shiva-ling-am. The ling-am probably stood in a shrine which some researchers say could have been about high. On the north side of the pyramid is a steep staircase leading to the top. The original stairs are in a very bad condition as is the bamboo-ladder which was constructed in the 20th century, so it is forbidden to climb to the top of the pyramid via this route. There is however a new staircase which can be used to ascend to the top tit of the pyramid. Concerning the seventh tier some scientists say, this was the platform of the shrine because on its sides beautiful reliefs of Garudas were made. There is just one Khmer temple which resembles the temple Baksei Chamkrong in Angkor. But the fourtiered monument there is much smaller and has a staircase on each of the four sides. On the platform on the top of the Baksei Chamkrong is a prasat in a good condition. Tomb of the White Elephant Behind the court with the seventiered pyramid is an artificial hill of exact circle form covered with trees. It is named Tomb of the White elephant. \\"The white Elephant\\" is a very well-known legend in southeast Asia. There are different theories about the hill. Some say that this structure could be the foundation of a second pyramid. Others say that it could be the grave of Jayavarman IV. The steep path leading to the top of the hill is closed now because of security reasons. =Sanctuaries along the access road= Prasat Pram The most south sanctuary of this group is the Prasat Pram on the west side of the road. A small () long path leads to the monument. It has five towers or prasats (pram = five). Three brick towers stand in a row on the same platform. They face east. The central one is a bit taller than the others. In each of these prasats, once stood a lingam. These and the beautifully carved lintels were looted. Two prasats (faced west) are standing in front of the platform. One is built of brick and has diamondshaped holes in the upper part. This fact indicates that this tower once served as a fire sanctuary (fire cults were very important during the era of the Khmer kings). The other building is small, made of laterite and (in comparison with the brick towers) in bad condition. The bricks of small regular size are held together with an organic mortar of unknown composition (plant sap?). Originally the towers were covered by white stucco; remains of it can still be seen. Two of the towers are pictorially covered by roots. The five towers are surrounded by an enclosure. The collapsed entrance door (gopuram) is at the east side. Two artefacts of the Prasat Pram can be seen in the National Museum in Phnom Penh: A damaged lion statue and fragments of a standing four-armed Vishnu. Prasat Neang Khmau Prasat Bak More north than the Prasat Neang Khmau and on the west side of the road is the Prasat Bak, a small square sanctuary built of laterite; one side measures only . The temple which is in a very bad condition today housed till 1960 a colossal statue of Ganesha (Ganesha is a Hindu god, son of Shiva and Uma. He is depicted with a human body and an elephant's head). It is known, that the sculpture with the sitting Ganesha now is in a collection outside of Cambodia.A short guide to the temples of Koh Ker, Heritage Watch, p. 10 Prasat Chen This sanctuary is the most north of this group and lies too on the west side of the street. It has two enclosures. The main entrance door (now collapsed) was itself a sanctuary with a square central room (one side measured ). Three laterite towers (partially collapsed) stand on the same platform. In front of them are the remains of two brick libraries. The statue of the two fighting monkey kings Sugriva and Valin (figures of the Hindu epic Ramayana) was found at this site and is now in the National Museum in Phnom Penh. A fragment of a multi-armed statue of Vishnu was found in front of the tower in the middle. In this temple are five inscriptions. They mention the names of all the numerous peoples connected to the temple site and their function. =Monuments along the ring-road= Prasat Balang (Prasat Leung Moi) The Prasat Balang is the first of three Linga-Shrines standing along the ring-road. It is a square laterite building standing on a platform and has one doorway and an open roof. In the sanctuary is an impressive lingam standing on yoni. The phallus-symbol is about high, has a diameter of nearly and a weight of several tons. Together with the yoni it was carved out of the bedrock at this place. The lingam is in a good condition. The yoni is about high and looks like an altar. On all four sides once were carved reliefs. In each of the four corners stood a beautiful chiselled Garudu with raised arms giving the impression these mythical figures would bear the yoni. Unfortunately the reliefs and the Garudas were looted. Around the Yoni there is just a small space giving room for some priests to perform the prescribed rituals. The water they put on the lingam became holy by touching the symbol of Shiva, run down and was collected in a ditch of the yoni. Then via a spout (with is still intact) it flowed to the outside of the shrine where believers could touch the blessed water. Prasat Thneng (Prasat Leung Pee) The Prasat Thneng is very similar to the Prasat Balang. Unfortunately looters tried to hack away the impressive lingam but were not successful. A notch of about a depth of half a meter (20 in) is left but the Shicva-symbol is still standing unshakeable at its place on the damaged yoni. Leung Bye Prasat Leung Bon Prasat Andong Kuk (Prasat Sralau) Prasat Krachap Prasat Bantaey Pee Chean Prasat Chrap Prasat Damrei A small path leads from the ring-road to the Prasat Damrei (damrei = elephant). This sanctuary has an enclosure and stands on a high platform. On each of its four sides is a staircase with about ten steps. Eight stone lions once flanked the stairs but only one remains in its original place. A beautiful elephant sculpture once stood at each of the four corners of the platform but only two remain. The sanctuary is built of brick and is in good condition. A Sanskrit inscription found at the temple offers evidence that an erstwhile lingam was once erected on the top of the pyramid (Prang).

It covers an area of , and the population as of 2000 is 16,504, of which 5,500 live in the central town of Mengen. The mayor is Turhan Bulut (CHP). Mengen is famous for its cooks and its annual cookery festival; chefs trained in Mengen can be found in the best hotels all over Turkey. The town is along the historical travel route between the large cities of Istanbul and Ankara, and a popular lodging destination for travelers between the cities. The cookery school in Mengen has traditionally trained chefs for the Turkish president in Ankara and other high government officials. Mengen is a forested district and the largest plain in the mountainous area surrounding it, where the traditional lifestyle has persisted. It is one of the few places in Turkey where the tradition of the k√∂√ßek (male belly dancers) at village weddings remains widespread. The k√∂√ßek also perform at the food festival in August. Mengen is from Ankara and is a popular weekend retreat for the people of the city. Hunting is a popular visitor sport in the district. In the summer, walking trails in the high country above the town become popular. The town prominently advertises its cookery tradition; it dons many billboards and statues of smiling chefs throughout the district. Dinner in Mengen is typically grilled meats and pilav rice served with lashings of Turkish rakƒ±, the traditional aniseed beverage. However, although Mengen trains and exports chefs to Turkey as a whole, there are not that many restaurants in the small town itself.

It is a member of the family of mathematical theories of concurrency known as process algebras or process calculi. ACP was initially developed by Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem Klop in 1982,J.C.M. Baeten, A brief history of process algebra, Rapport CSR 04-02, Vakgroep Informatica, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, 2004 as part of an effort to investigate the solutions of unguarded recursive equations. More so than the other seminal process calculi (CCS and CSP), the development of ACP focused on the algebra of processes, and sought to create an abstract, generalized axiomatic system for processes,Bas Luttik, What is algebraic in process theory, Algebraic Process Calculi: The First Twenty Five Years and Beyond , Bertinoro, Italy, August 1, 2005 and in fact the term process algebra was coined during the research that led to ACP.  Informal description  ACP is fundamentally an algebra, in the sense of universal algebra. This algebra is a way to describe systems in terms of algebraic process expressions that define compositions of other processes, or of certain primitive elements. =Primitives= ACP uses instantaneous, atomic actions (mathit{a,b,c,...}) as its primitives. Some actions have special meaning, such as the action delta, which represents deadlock or stagnation, and the action tau, which represents a silent action (abstracted actions that have no specific identity). =Algebraic operators = Actions can be combined to form processes using a variety of operators. These operators can be roughly categorized as providing a basic process algebra, concurrency, and communication. * Choice and sequencing ‚Äì the most fundamental of algebraic operators are the alternative operator (+), which provides a choice between actions, and the sequencing operator (cdot), which specifies an ordering on actions. So, for example, the process : (a+b)cdot c : first chooses to perform either mathit{a} or mathit{b}, and then performs action mathit{c}. How the choice between mathit{a} and mathit{b} is made does not matter and is left unspecified. Note that alternative composition is commutative but sequential composition is not (because time flows forward). * Concurrency ‚Äì to allow the description of concurrency, ACP provides the merge and left-merge operators. The merge operator, vert vert, represents the parallel composition of two processes, the individual actions of which are interleaved. The left-merge operator, vertlfloor, is an auxiliary operator with similar semantics to the merge, but a commitment to always choose its initial step from the left-hand process. As an example, the process :(a cdot b) vert vert (c cdot d) : may perform the actions a, b, c, d in any of the sequences abcd, acbd, acdb, cabd, cadb, cdab. On the other hand, the process :(a cdot b) vert lfloor (c cdot d) : may only perform the sequences abcd, acbd, acdb since the left-merge operators ensure that the action mathit{a} occurs first. * Communication -- interaction (or communication) between processes is represented using the binary communications operator, vert. For example, the actions r(d) and w(d) might be interpreted as the reading and writing of a data item d in D = {1,2,3,ldots}, respectively. Then the process :left(sum_{d in D} r(d) cdot yright) vert (w(1) cdot z) :will communicate the value 1 from the right component process to the left component process (i.e. the identifier mathit{d} is bound to the value 1, and free instances of mathit{d} in the process mathit{y} take on that value), and then behave as the merge of mathit{y} and mathit{z}. * Abstraction -- the abstraction operator, tau_I, is a way to \\"hide\\" certain actions, and treat them as events that are internal to the systems being modelled. Abstracted actions are converted to the silent step action tau. In some cases, these silent steps can also be removed from the process expression as part of the abstraction process. For example, : tau_{{c}}((a+b)cdot c) = (a + b) cdot tau :which, in this case, can be reduced to : a + b :since the event mathit{c} is no longer observable and has no observable effects.  Formal definition  ACP fundamentally adopts an axiomatic, algebraic approach to the formal definition of its various operators. The axioms presented below comprise the full axiomatic system for ACPtau (ACP with abstraction). = Basic process algebra = Using the alternative and sequential composition operators, ACP defines a basic process algebra which satisfies the axiomsJ.A. Bergstra and J.W. Klop, ACPœÑ: A Universal Axiom System for Process Specification, CWI Quarterly 15, pp. 3-23, 1987 : begin{matrix} x + y &=& y + x (x+y)+z&=& x+(y+z) x+x&=&x; (x+y)cdot z &=& (xcdot z) + (ycdot z) (x cdot y)cdot z &=& x cdot (y cdot z) end{matrix} = Deadlock = Beyond the basic algebra, two additional axioms define the relationships between the alternative and sequencing operators, and the deadlock action, delta : begin{matrix} delta + x &=& x delta cdot x &=& delta end{matrix} = Concurrency and interaction = The axioms associated with the merge, left-merge, and communication operators are : begin{matrix} x vertvert y &=& x vertlfloor y + y vertlfloor x + x vert y a cdot x vertlfloor y &=& acdot ( x vertvert y) a vertlfloor y &=& a cdot y  (x+y) vertlfloor z &=& (x vertlfloor z) + (y vertlfloor z) a cdot x vert b &=& (a vert b)cdot x a vert b cdot x &=& (a vert b)cdot x a cdot x vert b cdot y &=& (avert b)cdot (x vert vert y) (x + y)vert z &=& xvert z + yvert z x vert (y + z) &=& xvert y + xvert z end{matrix} When the communications operator is applied to actions alone, rather than processes, it is interpreted as a binary function from actions to actions, vert : A times A rightarrow A. The definition of this function defines the possible interactions between processes -- those pairs of actions that do not constitute interactions are mapped to the deadlock action, delta, while permitted interaction pairs are mapped to corresponding single actions representing the occurrence of an interaction. For example, the communications function might specify that :a vert a rightarrow c which indicates that a successful interaction a vert a will be reduced to the action c. ACP also includes an encapsulation operator, partial_H for some H subseteq A, which is used to convert unsuccessful communication attempts (i.e. elements of H that have not been reduced via the communication function) to the deadlock action. The axioms associated with the communications function and encapsulation operator are : begin{matrix} a vert b &=& b vert a (a vert b) vert c &=& a vert (b vert c) a vert delta &=& delta partial_H(a) &=& a mbox{ if } a otin H partial_H(a) &=& delta mbox{ if } a in H partial_H(x + y) &=& partial_H(x) + partial_H(y) partial_H(x cdot y) &=& partial_H(x) cdot partial_H(y) end{matrix} = Abstraction = The axioms associated with the abstraction operator are : begin{matrix} tau_I(tau) &=& tau tau_I(a) &=& a mbox{ if } a otin I tau_I(a) &=& tau mbox{ if } a in I tau_I(x + y) &=& tau_I(x) + tau_I(y) tau_I(x cdot y) &=& tau_I(x) cdot tau_I(y) partial_H(tau) &=& tau x cdot tau &=& x tau cdot x &=& tau cdot x + x acdot(taucdot x + y) &=& acdot(taucdot x + y) + acdot x  tau cdot x vertlfloor y &=& taucdot ( x vertvert y) tau vertlfloor x &=& tau cdot x  tau vert x &=& delta x vert tau &=& delta taucdot x vert y &=& x vert y x vert taucdot y &=& x vert y end{matrix} Note that the action a in the above list may take the value Œ¥ (but of course, Œ¥ cannot belong to the abstraction set I).

From 1977 to 1985, he was a lecturer in anthropology at the University of Durham. He has been a fellow of King's College, Cambridge since 1987, and Leverhulme Professor of Human Evolution at the University of Cambridge since 2003. Early career Foley was born on 18 March 1953 in Sussex, England, to Nelson and Jean Foley. He was educated at Ardingly College and Peterhouse, Cambridge where he earned an MA and PhD in archaeology. Academic career From 1977 to 1985, Foley was a Lecturer in Anthropology at the University of Durham. He then returned to the University of Cambridge to take up a post in the Department of Biological Anthropology. From 1986 to 1998, he was a lecturer in Biological Anthropology. Since 1987, he has been a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. From 1998 to 2003, he was Reader in Evolutionary Anthropology. He co-founded the Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies in 2001 with Marta Miraz√≥n Lahr, and has been its director since its inception. The Centre was designed to provide a home for the Duckworth Collection, and first class laboratories and facilities to support research in human evolution which integrated genetics, anthropology, and other fields. In 2003, he was appointed Leverhulme Professor of Human Evolution. Research Foley has carried out research in many aspects of evolutionary theory, human evolution, prehistory and more recently human evolutionary genetics. His early work was on the Later Stone Age of East Africa, where he developed methods and ideas to study the landscape distributions of artefacts, giving rise to the sub-field of Off-Site Archaeology. In his work on human evolution he has emphasized an evolutionary ecological approach, seeing human adaptations as solutions to the problems faced by hominins in the environments in which they were living. This evolutionary research has also explored the relationship between climate and evolutionary change, the evolution of social behavior (finite social space model), and patterns of hominin diversity. This approach was summarized in two books ‚Äì Another Unique Species, and Humans Before Humanity. Since the 1990s, Foley has collaborated with Marta Miraz√≥n Lahr on research relating to the evolution of modern humans and their diversity. Their work has argued for multiple dispersals of early humans out of Africa, and the use of the ‚Äòsouthern route‚Äô. Their approach has emphasized the role of geographical factors in shaping human evolution, and a central role for dispersals as the process by which diversity evolves. He has co-led expeditions and archaeological excavations with Mirazon Lahr in the Solomon Islands, the Central Sahara, and Kenya, particularly in the Turkana Basin. In Turkana, Foley and Mirazon Lahr study the late Quaternary record of human occupation in the basin, and have recently described a group of 10,000 year-old skeletons from the site of Nataruk that died as part of conflict between hunter-gatherer bands. In the last decade, Foley has been involved in several aspects of evolutionary psychology and linguistics, exploring questions related to the evolution of human cognition, human language and its use as a mechanism is the evolution of society and social boundaries. Honours In 2007, Foley was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA).  References  Selected publications  External links *Robert A.

The image also shows the village which straddles the neck of land joining the James's Fort townland to the main body of the peninsula. James's Fort, which is not pictured, is off to the left The Castlepark peninsula in Kinsale harbour on the coast of County Cork, on the south coast of Ireland is really more a presque-isle than a peninsula, being joined to the mainland only by an extremely narrow neck at its north-western corner. Thus, the Castlepark peninsula is almost surrounded by water: the River Bandon, flowing from the north-west, bounds the peninsula on the north; the entrance to Kinsale harbour bounds the peninsula on the east; the Atlantic Ocean bounds it to the south; and the tidal inlet known as Sandycove Creek bounds the peninsula on the west. Most traffic into Castlepark now arrives via the Duggan Bridge, built 1976, which crosses the River Bandon from the northern, Kinsale, bank just east of the neck which joins the peninsula to the mainland. Among the old buildings on the peninsula are: James's Fort (early 17th century); Ringrone Castle (12th or 13th century), a former seat of the Barons Kingsale; and the ruins of Ringrone Church, the latter surrounded by an ancient graveyard that is still in use. Located within the parish of Courceys, the peninsula, which has an area of a little under , contains three townlands: James's Fort, Castlepark and Castlelands. The James's Fort townland, which contains James's Fort, is, itself, a peninsula, protruding out of the north- eastern corner of the Castlepark peninsula. On the western side of the neck which joins the James's Fort peninsula to the main Castlepark peninsula there is a marina; on the eastern side of the neck, there is a sandy beach; a small village, most of whose houses were built in the 1970s although some date back to at least the early 19th century, straddles the neck. The rest of the peninsula consists of farmland with scattered housing. Most of the land is used for tillage (cereals and sugar beet), although there is some grazing of cattle and sheep. By the late 1990s, only one of the farms was still involved in dairying. Sandycove Island, at the mouth of Sandycove Creek, is uninhabited; a herd of goats grazes the island so, presumably, fresh water is available.

He attended the ‚ÄúLeibniz Gymnasium‚Äù in Bad Schwartau where he did his Abitur (A-level) in 1984. After his military service he studied history and Romance philology. He graduated Magister Artium. During his studies he worked as a corrector and translator for the Carlsen-Verlag (Carlsen-press). Sick explains in the foreword of the Carlsen anniversary issue ‚ÄúSpirou & Fantasio‚Äù that the work experience as a translator and corrector coined his sense for orthography and punctuation. In 1995 Bastian Sick started working as a documentation journalist in the photo archive of German news magazine Der Spiegel. In 1999 he joined the editorial team of the magazine ‚ÄúSpiegel online‚Äù and became a literary editor. In 2003 he became famous as the author of the column ‚ÄúZwiebelfisch‚Äù. In those columns he writes in a funny and entertaining way about the case of doubt in the German language, for example grammar, spelling, punctuation and style. In 2004, 50 of these columns were published in print by Kiepenheuer & Witsch in Cologne. The title of the book called Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod (literally The Dative is to the Genitive its Death) use puns employing the his genitive, which is not used in standard German and often considered unaesthetic, instead of the normative genitive case. More than 2 million copies of this book were sold within two years. Two sequels have been published within the same time period. The ‚ÄúZwiebelfisch‚Äù was the first Internet column which became a bestseller after it was published as a book. Besides his columns Bastian Sick published other books about language curiosities. For instance ‚ÄúHappy Aua‚Äù,A pun of English hour and German Aua, meaning ouch or booboo part 1-4. From the content of the book series ‚ÄúDer Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod‚Äù board games, computer games and calendar were produced. Sick has done several tours of reading where he also performed as an entertainer. On the 13 of March 2006, Bastian Sick performed in the Cologne Arena in front of an audience of 15.000 people in ‚Äúthe biggest German lesson of the world‚Äù. Therefore, he was supported by others such as Thomas Bug, Joachim Hermann Luger, J√ºrgen R√ºttgers, Frank Plasberg, Frank Rost, Cordula Stratmann, and Annette Frier. Recordings from this event and recordings from his tours were published as audio books. Due to an invitation of the Sony-BMG in 2007, Bastian Sick published a CD called ‚ÄúLieder voller Poesie‚Äù, a homage to the musician and singer Udo J√ºrgens. In the year 2008 Sick hosted a temporary TV-Show on WDR. With artists like Jochen Busse, Konrad Beikircher and Susanne P√§tzold Sick presented in his thirty minutes show oddities out of the language everyday life. In the following year Sick left the Spiegel publishing company and became a self-employed author and speaker. With his program ‚ÄúNur aus Jux und Tolleranz‚ÄùA pun of German Tollerei meaning nonsense and German Toleranz meaning tolerance he went on tour through Germany in 2011 and 2013. Invited by the Goethe Institute, German schools and other educational establishments Sick did many performances in foreign countries, for example in Montr√©al (Canada), Hungary, Spain, Portugal, South Tyrol (Italy), Great Britain and Egypt. In addition he did a South-America tour with eight performances in six countries in 2008. Bastian Sick lives and works in Hamburg. Works =Books= * Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod.

Rocket stove Type: L-Tube A rocket stove Rocket stove Type: L-Tube Rocket stove illustration A rocket stove is an efficient and hot burning stove using small-diameter wood fuel. Fuel is burned in a simple combustion chamber containing an insulated vertical chimney, which ensures almost complete combustion prior to the flames reaching the cooking surface. Rocket stove designs are most often used for portable stoves for cooking but the design is also used for large fixed stoves in institutions, and to make rocket mass heaters for heating. In field tests in India, rocket stoves used 18 to 35 percent less fuel compared to the traditional stoves and reduced fuel used 39-47 percent compared to the simple traditional open three- stone fire, as well as a large reduction in emissions.  History  A precursor to the rocket stove was the argand lamp, which was patented in 1780. This was a major development of the traditional oil lamp, which introduced a glass chimney above the flame to increase air-flow. As well as being used for lighting, this design was also used for cooking and heating water due to it \\"affording much the strongest heat without smoke\\". Dr. Larry Winiarski, Technical Director of Aprovecho, began developing the Rocket Stove in 1980 based on a VITA stove, designed by Sam Baldwin, and rediscovered the principles of the systems developed by the Romans in hypocaust heating and cooking systems. TWP and AHDESA were winners at the Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy in 2005 in the \\"Health and Welfare\\" category for their work in Honduras with the \\"Justa Stove\\", based on principles of the rocket stove. Aprovecho were winners of the Special Africa Award at the Ashden Awards in 2006 for their work with rocket stoves for institutional cooking in Lesotho, Malawi, Uganda, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia.  Use in Developing Countries  Many developing countries use traditional wood fuel stoves without proper ventilation, which produces indoor concentrations of particles \\"typically 10 to 100 times the long-term levels recommended by the World Health Organization.\\" Chronic exposure to these particles are linked with pneumonia, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Rocket stoves are an alternative method to wood fuel stoves as they use less fuel and have lower emissions. In Rural Kenya, a comparison of traditional three-stone stove and rocket mud stoves (RMS) showed that RMS use resulted in a 33% reduction of carbon monoxide production in the kitchen and a 42% reduction in \\"personal\\" carbon monoxide production, which was measured with loggers placed on clothing in the study.

Any aircraft's airworthiness category is shown on its airworthiness certificate. The name \\"transport category\\" is used in the US, Canada, Europe and many other countries. A principle behind transport category design standards is that any element in an airplane or helicopter can fail, but the risk of such a failure causing an accident should be extremely low. Consequently, transport category airplanes and helicopters have duplicated elements wherever failure of one element is likely to cause an accident. For example, transport category airplanes must have at least two engines and be flown by at least two pilots. The loads on the wings and tailplanes are usually carried by multiple load paths. If one element of the primary structure fails due to metal fatigue or corrosion the remaining sound elements of the structure must carry the loads until the failed structural element is discovered in routine maintenance. This fail-safe principle is not necessary in airplanes and helicopters that are not certificated in the transport category. If an element in a transport category airplane or helicopter is not highly critical, or if its failure is relatively benign, it is possible for that element not to be duplicated. For example, most transport category airplanes do not have duplicated nosewheel assemblies; and some do not have duplicated wheels on each main undercarriage. A transport category helicopter is permitted to have only one main rotor head, and may have only one engine. If a transport category helicopter has only one engine it is only eligible to be a Class B (or Performance Group 2) helicopter. An example of a transport category helicopter with only one engine is the Bell 204/205.  Standards  In the United States, Federal Aviation Regulations Parts 25 and 29 are applied to transport category airplanes and helicopters. In Europe the European Aviation Safety Agency has similar certification specifications, also titled Parts 25 and 29, for application to large airplanes and helicopters. = FAA =  Airplane  Transport category airplanes are either:FAA design approval Transport Airplanes * Jets with 10 or more seats or a maximum takeoff weights (MTOW) greater than 12,500 lb (5700 kg); or * Propeller-driven airplanes with greater than 19 seats or a MTOW greater than 19,000 lb (8618 kg). Easily recognizable examples of transport category airplanes are Boeing and Airbus aircraft, Learjet 30 series, de Havilland Canada Dash 8, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.  Helicopter  Transport category helicopters typically have maximum takeoff weights greater than 7,000 lb (3 175 kg) although there is no lower weight limit.

Waters, 515 F.2d 485 (6th Cir. 1975) was a 1975 legal case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit struck down Tennessee's law regarding the teaching of \\"equal time\\" of evolution and creationism in public school science classes because it violated the Establishment clause of the US Constitution. The plaintiffs were school teachers supported by the National Association of Biology Teachers. Background Various state laws prohibiting the teaching of evolution had been introduced during the 1920s. These laws were challenged in 1968 in the case Epperson v. Arkansas, which established that such laws were to be held in violation of the constitutional separation of Church and State.. The creationist movement reacted to the decision by turning to the promotion of the teaching of creationism in school science classes as equal to evolutionary theory.Creationism/ID, A Short Legal History By Lenny Flank, Talk Reason The act The Tennessee law stated that, from the beginning of the school year of 1975-76; :\\"Any biology textbook used for teaching in the public schools, which expresses an opinion of, or relates a theory about origins or creation of man and his world shall be prohibited from being used as a textbook in such system unless it specifically states that it is a theory as to the origin and creation of man and his world and is not represented to be scientific fact. Any textbook so used in the public education system which expresses an opinion or relates to a theory or theories shall give in the same text-book and under the same subject commensurate attention to, and an equal amount of emphasis on, the origins and creation of man and his world as the same is recorded in other theories, including, but not limited to, the Genesis account in the Bible.\\" The law defined the Bible as a \\"reference work\\", which did not have to carry the disclaimer \\"that it is a theory ...and is not represented to be scientific fact\\" required in textbooks. The ruling The Federal District Court ruling was that the Tennessee law was \\"a clearly defined preferential position for the Biblical version of creation as opposed to any account of the development of man based on scientific research and reasoning. For a state to seek to enforce such preference by law is to seek to accomplish the very establishment of religion which the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States squarely forbids.\\" Effect of the ruling The ruling did not prevent the Bible from being taught in public schools in an appropriate way. The Court stated (quoting from a prior decision): \\"While study of religions and of the Bible from a literary and historic viewpoint, presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, need not collide with the First Amendment's prohibition, the State may not adopt programs or practices in its public schools or colleges which \\"aid or oppose\\" any religion.\\". Following this ruling, several states then passed new legislation which required that creation science be given equal time with teaching of evolution. This came to court as McLean v. Arkansas (1982), which resulted in a detailed ruling that it was similarly unconstitutional to teach this in public school science classes. This was a District level ruling and, while setting a persuasive precedent, it was only a binding precedent in the relevant district. It was not until Edwards v. Aguillard (1987), a similar case in Louisiana, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court that creation science was ruled unconstitutional at the federal level,. which resulted in its removal from public school science classes nationwide. The reaction from the creationist forces would be to create the new concept of intelligent design specifically in order to circumvent this ruling.

Van Slingelandt was a staunch republican, who wanted to keep the House of Orange out of the centre of power. He was a strong advocate of an alliance with Great Britain; otherwise, he thought, the United Provinces wouldn't survive. He mediated peace between Great Britain and Austria in 1732 and between France and Austria in 1736.

It is located on the Merthyr Tydfil branch of the Merthyr Line. Passenger services are provided by Transport for Wales. History The station was opened as \\"Quakers Yard Low Level\\" by the Taff Vale Railway in 1858. Isambard Kingdom Brunel built the Goitre Coed Viaduct, it was opened in 1841. Its height is approx 100 ft the Goitre Coed Viaduct was widened in 1862 with another stone bridge of slightly differing design sitting embedded next to the original one, this addition can easily be spotted when passing underneath the viaducts arches on the Taff Trail cycle route 8. This viaduct still exists as the gateway to the Taff Valley for the Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil railway line. In a recent TV appearance, a Brunel expert put the Goitre Coed Viaduct as the finest example of Brunel's viaducts in Wales. Two more viaducts existed at the north end of Edwardsville which were demolished shortly after the Beeching cuts of the 1960s. The main reason for their demolition was subsidence and the viaducts had been strengthened with huge wooden supports for a number of years. Until June 1964 (when the adjacent Vale of Neath Railway High Level station was closed, along with the Pontypool Road to Neath line that passed through it),Page, James. (1988), Forgotten Railways: Volume 8 - South Wales (2nd Ed), David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbott, , p.37 this was a large, two-level junction with services to numerous locations and a hub through which large amounts of coal were transported. The line from Abercynon-Merthyr Tydfil is now a single line operation, the dual track being removed in the early 1970s, although some dual track has since been brought back at Merthyr Vale running towards Merthyr Tydfil to help with the increased frequency of services. Location Today the station is situated below the Taff Vale estate where bespoke detached properties have been built on the high level line area and also on the incline that existed from the lower level which ran towards Treharris. The derelict upper level was partitioned when the Taff Vale estate was built. The land to the east below Edwardsville cemetery was earmarked for business units - but was eventually sold off to Bailey Homes house builders - mainly detached houses were built and named Forest Grove. A small senior citizen sheltered bungalow complex buffers this site with the Taff Vale site. Quakers Yard station is provides access to and from the Taff Trail cycle route. The beauty spot at Pontygwaith Bridge over the River Taff lies about 1 mile north on the trail. Arriva Trains Wales allow cyclists on local trains with some restrictions on timing. Access to the Taff Trail is via a foot crossing over the railway line a short distance north of the railway platform. This section of the Taff Trail includes the original stone sleepers from Edwardsville towards Pontygwaith and beyond towards Mount Pleasant, where Richard Trevithick ran the first ever steam locomotive to run on rails and the first to carry passengers in 1804. Services Trains run every half-hour each way, north to and south to & . Southbound trains continue alternately to and via the Vale of Glamorgan Line. On Sundays there is a two-hourly service each way to Merthyr & Bridgend.GB National Rail Timetable 2015-2016 Edition, Table 130 (Network Rail)  Edwardsville  Edwardsville is the name given to the small urban area that grew up around the Quakers Yard station. The railway pre-dated the villages of both Edwardsville and Treharris. Although not close to Quakers Yard village, this was the only local placename of any note at the time. The Edwardsville area began as a public house and a few houses on the road along the valley to Merthyr. The Great Western Hotel, still exists just above the railway station, with strong links to the railways obvious by its name. Around 1900 the area acquired its name from the landlord of this pub, Edmund Edwards. Mrs C M Williams of Grove House, Edwardsville, wrote: The suffix ‚Äò-ville‚Äô was popular for new placenames around this time, particularly those largely built by speculative builders or landlords. It suggested both a pastoral ‚Äòvillage‚Äô and also a then-fashionably French aspect of 'ville' (town). Edwardsville expanded on both sides of the road and soon had a board school and chapel. On 27 October 1913, much destruction was caused in Edwardsville when it was hit by a tornado. The roofs of many houses, the school and chapel were destroyed. Three people were killed and over a hundred injured. Damage was caused over a wide area, with chimneys also demolished as far down the valley as Pontypridd. This toll remains Britain's highest for a tornado. Recently Edwardsville has expanded below the main road, with new houses filling the space of the previous high-level station. Edwardsville is part of the Treharris community, as is Quakers Yard. Boosted by the pit, Treharris has grown to be larger than both.

He left for the Indies in 1514 along with Hernando de Luque on a fleet commanded by Pedro Arias D√°vila. Conflict between Quevedo and Arias D√°vila soon ensued as Quevedo strongly protested against the cruel acts committed by the governor and his officers, not only against the Indians, but also against rivals, such as the beheading of Vasco Nu√±ez de Balboa, the discoverer of the Pacific Ocean.Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Juan de Quevedo\\" retrieved January 11, 2015 Counter charges were brought against Quevedo with Bartolom√© de Las Casas accusing him of having violated a trust, accumulated wealth, and neglected the Indians, but the veracity of Las Casas' accusations has not been established. Quevedo returned to Spain in (1518) and presented two memorials to King Charles. One was against Arias D√°vila, and the other advocated restricting the powers of all governors in the New World for the better protection of the natives. When these documents were shown to Las Casas, in spite of differences between the two, he offered to countersign them. Bishop Quevedo soon fell sick and died at Barcelona. In spite of Quevedo's record as a champion of the rights of Native Americans, his views were still coloured by his time and his missionary fervour. He regarded all the aborigines of America to be a race of men whom it would be impossible to instruct or improve unless they were collected in villages or missions and kept under continual supervision.

The collective cases are often colloquially called the ‚ÄúSatanic Panic.‚Äù A prominent case in Kern County, California, United States, first publicized the issue of day-care sexual abuse, and the issue figured prominently in news coverage for almost a decade. The Kern County case was followed by cases elsewhere in the United States, as well as Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, and various European countries. Causes =Anxiety= During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many more mothers were working outside of the home, resulting in the opening of large numbers of day-care facilities. Anxiety and guilt due to leaving young children with strangers may have created a climate of fear and readiness to believe false accusations. =Suggestions and false allegations when interviewing children= Children are vulnerable to outside influences that can result in fabrication of testimony. Their testimony can be influenced in a variety of ways. In an article published by the American Psychological Association and titled Jeopardy in the Courtroom: A Scientific Analysis of Children‚Äôs Testimony, Dr. Maggie Bruck‚Äîa professor within the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine‚Äîwrote that children incorporate aspects of the interviewer's questions into their answers, as an attempt to tell the interviewer what the child believes is being sought. Studies also show that when adults ask children questions that do not make sense (such as: \\"is milk bigger than water?\\" or \\"is red heavier than yellow?\\"), most children will offer an answer, believing that there is an answer to be given, rather than understanding the absurdity of the question. Furthermore, repeated questioning of children causes them to change their answers. This is because the children perceive the repeated questioning as a sign that they did not give the \\"correct\\" answer previously. Children are also especially susceptible to leading and suggestive questions.Carter, p. 21.

Krugman: Erroneous Concerns about Child Sexual Abuse. Child Abuse & Neglect 24: 149‚Äì57, 2000 \\"There were 14 (2.5%) erroneous concerns emanating from children.\\"Everson, M.D., and B. W. Boat: False Allegations of Sexual Abuse by Children and Adolescents. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 28, 230‚Äì35, 1989. Other studies have shown that children understate occurrences of abuse. Interviewer bias also influences child testimony. When an interviewer has a preconceived notion as to the truth of the matter being investigated, the questioning is performed in a manner to extract statements that evidence these beliefs. As a result, evidence that could disprove the belief is never sought by the interviewer. Additionally, positive reinforcement by the interviewer can taint child testimony. Often, such reinforcement is given to encourage a spirit of cooperation by the child, but impartiality can quickly end as the interviewer nods, smiles, or offers verbal encouragement to \\"helpful\\" statements. Some studies show that when interviewers make reassuring statements to child witnesses, the children are more likely to fabricate stories of past events that never occurred. Peer pressure also influences children to fabricate stories. Studies show that when a child witness is told that his or her friends have already testified that certain events occurred, the child witness was more likely to create a matching story. The status of the interviewer can also influence a child's testimony, because the more authority an interviewer has, such as a police officer, the more likely a child is to comply with that person's apparent agenda. Finally, while there are endorsers of the use of anatomically correct dolls in questioning victims of sexual abuse/molestation, there are also critics of this practice. These critics say that because of the novelty of the dolls, children will act out sexually explicit acts with the dolls even if the child has not been sexually abused. Another criticism is that because the studies that compare the differences between how abused and non-abused children play with these dolls are conflicting (some studies suggest that sexually abused children play with anatomically correct dolls in a more sexually explicit manner than non-abused children, while other studies suggest that there is not any correlation), it is impossible to interpret what is meant by how a child plays with these dolls.

Significant cases Most of those accused in these cases were eventually freed, but no U.S. Governor has pardoned a prisoner convicted falsely as a result of the hysteria. On January 14, 1997, many of those freed attended a \\"Day of Contrition\\" conference in Salem, Massachusetts.https://www.religioustolerance.org/day_cont.htm =McMartin Preschool= The McMartin Preschool case was the first daycare abuse case to receive major media attention in the United States. The case concerned the McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach, California, where seven teachers were accused of kidnapping children, flying them in an airplane to another location, and forcing them to engage in group sex, as well as forcing them to watch animals being tortured and killed. The case also involved accusations that children had been forced to participate in bizarre religious rituals, and being used to make child pornography. The case began with a single accusation, made by a mother‚Äîwho was later found to be a paranoid schizophrenic‚Äîof one of the students, but grew rapidly when investigators informed parents of the accusation, and began interviewing other students. The case made headlines nationally during 1984, and seven teachers were arrested and charged that year. However, when a new district attorney took over the case in 1986, his office re-examined the evidence, and dismissed charges against all but two of the original defendants. Their trials became one of the longest and most expensive criminal trials in the history of the United States, but in 1990, all of these charges were also dismissed. The trial was met with disapproval by both its jurors and academic researchers, who criticized the interviewing techniques that investigators had used in their investigations of the school, alleging that interviewers had \\"coaxed\\" children into making unfounded accusations, repeatedly asking children the same questions, and offering various incentives until the children reported having been abused. Most scholars now agree that the accusations these interviews elicited from children were false. Sociologist Mary de Young and historian Philip Jenkins have both cited the McMartin case as the prototype for a wave of similar accusations and investigations between 1983 and 1995, which constituted a moral panic.https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3292&context;=jssw =Country Walk= Frank and Ileana Fuster owned the Country Walk Babysitting Service in the Country Walk suburb of Miami, Florida. In 1985, Frank was found guilty of 14 counts of abuse. He was sentenced to prison with a minimum length of 165 years. Fuster's alleged victims testified that he led them in Satanic rituals, and terrorized them by forcing them to watch him mutilate birds‚Äîa lesson to children who might reveal the abuse. Fuster had been previously convicted for manslaughter and molesting a 9-year-old child. Testimony from children in the case was elicited by University of Miami child psychologists Laurie and Joseph Braga, who resorted to coercive questioning of the alleged victims when the desired answers were not forthcoming. Fuster's wife, Ileana, recanted her court testimony in an interview with the television program Frontline, saying that she had been kept naked in solitary confinement, and subjected to other forms of physical and psychological duress until she had agreed to testify against her husband. The case was prosecuted by Dade County state's attorney Janet Reno, who also prosecuted day-care sex-abuse cases against Grant Snowden and Bobby Fijnje. Ileana said Reno visited her in jail and pressured her to confess. The incident also inspired a 1986 book and a 1990 made-for-television movie named Unspeakable Acts. , Fuster continues to serve a 165-year prison sentence, allegedly making him the last person imprisoned by the hysteria. =Fells Acres Day Care Center= During April 1984, Gerald Amirault was arrested and charged with abusing children in his care at the Fells Acres Day Care Center in Malden, Massachusetts. After Amirault changed the pants on a young boy who had wet himself, the boy's mother, uncle, and therapist questioned him over a period of months, until the boy alleged that Amirault had been sexually abusing him. The boy's mother then telephoned a child abuse hotline to report that her son had been abused sexually, and Amirault was arrested soon thereafter. As a result of the 1986 trial, Amirault was convicted of assaulting and raping nine children, and sentenced to thirty to forty years in state prison. In a separate trial, his mother, Violet Amirault, and sister, Cheryl Amirault LeFave, were also convicted of similar charges, and sentenced to jail for eight to 20 years. According to Richard Beck, the case developed \\"in the usual way\\" compared to other moral panic cases, with more and more children making increasingly bizarre allegations against the accused during the course of the investigation. The allegations included reports of \\"bad clowns,\\" robots, \\"magic rooms,\\" and animals tortured.\\"Profile: Case of Gerald Amirault, a convicted child sex offender, and the prosecution of child sexual molestation cases.\\" All Things Considered, April 19, 2000. General OneFile (accessed May 3, 2017). According to Beck, one of the prosecutors responsible for the case commented that coaxing allegations out of the children had been like ‚Äúgetting blood from a stone.‚Äù During 1995, The Wall Street Journal journalist Dorothy Rabinowitz questioned testimony from the children that had been elicited with dubious interrogation techniques, and wrote: \\"no sane person reading the transcripts of these interrogations can doubt the wholesale fabrications of evidence on which this case was built.\\" Rabinowitz was a finalist in 1996, and winner in 2001, of the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for her newspaper columns on the issue, and made the Amirault's case a centerpiece of her book No Crueler Tyrannies: Accusation, False Witness, and Other Terrors of Our Times. Violet and Cheryl were granted a new trial in 1997, on the basis that they had been denied the right to face their accusers and had been represented inadequately at trial, but Violet died, and a judge reduced Cheryl's sentence to time served before the new trial could proceed.Kathleen Burge, \\"Board Grants Parole to Amirault,\\" Boston Globe 18 October 2003. During 2001, the Massachusetts Board of Pardons recommended that Gerald's sentence be commuted, citing \\"substantial doubt\\" about his guilt. He was granted parole in 2003.\\"Freedom for Gerald Amirault,\\" Hartford Courant, 23 October 2003 Writing about the case at the time of Gerald's release, the magazine The Economist suggested in an editorial that while the Amiraults had long maintained their innocence and had attracted a \\"string of prominent supporters\\" who believed that they had been convicted wrongly, \\"many others continue to believe that Mr. Amirault committed the crimes.\\"\\"A matter of evidence; crime and punishment,\\" The Economist. 1 May 2004. =Bernard Baran= On October 4, 1984, a drug addicted couple acting as police informants telephoned their contact within the police department of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and accused Bernard Baran of molesting their son. The child had been attending the government operated Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC) where Baran, an openly homosexual 19-year-old, worked as a teacher's aide. The accusers had complained previously to the board of directors that they \\"didn't want no homo\\" around their son.Superior Court Criminal Action No. 18042-51. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Memorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant's Motion For A New Trial. 2006-06-21. Background, p. 6. \\"In 1984, Bernard Baran worked at the Early Childhood Development Center ('ECDC') as a teacher's aide. The allegations in this case emanate from his contact with pre-school children who were enrolled in this facility. The first family to bring accusations against Mr. Baran was that of Boy A. Previously, the boy's father had filed a complaint with ECDC objecting to Mr. Baran being allowed to work with children because he was a homosexual. On September 12th, 1984, the ECDC Board of Directors discussed Mr. Baran's sexuality and his possible termination. On October 5th, 1984, this family contacted the police to report that Mr. Baran had molested their child.\\"\\"Video helps clear convict of abuse after 21 years.\\" http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32341725 Associated Press / NBC News. 2009-08-09. His case had followed a tortured path ‚Äì the first complaint came from a drug- addicted couple, acting as narcotics informants, who told their police connection they \\"didn't want no homo\\" watching their son. Within days of the first allegation, ECDC hosted a puppet show, and delivered letters to parents notifying them about a child at the day care who had gonorrhea. Five other allegations were made. Baran was tried in the Berkshire County courthouse 105 days after the first allegation, a swiftness noted in the later court rulings. The courtroom was closed during the children's testimony, which Baran claimed violated his right to a public trial. Baran's defense attorney was later ruled ineffective. Baran was convicted on January 30, 1985, of three counts of rape of a child, and five counts of indecent assault and battery. He was sentenced to three life terms, plus 8 to 20 years on each charge. Baran maintained his innocence throughout his case.Pollitt, Katha. 2000-02-03. \\"Justice for Bernard Baran.\\" The Nation \\"Baran maintained his innocence throughout his imprisonment, making him ineligible for parole.\\" In 1999, a new legal team accepted his case. In 2004, hearings began in a motion for a new trial. In 2006, Baran was granted a new trial, and released on $50,000 bail. In May 2009, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the new trial ruling, setting aside the 1985 convictions. The Berkshire County District Attorney's office dismissed the original charges, and Baran's record was cleared.\\"D.A. Capeless decides not to continue prosecuting Baran.\\" 2009-06-09. The Berkshire County District Attorney's Office. =The Bronx Five= Prosecutor Mario Merola brought prosecutions resulting in the conviction of five men, including Nathaniel Grady, a 47-year-old Methodist minister, of sexually abusing children in day care facilities throughout the Bronx. Grady spent ten years in prison before being released in 1996. Three employees of another Bronx day- care center were arrested during August 1984 on the charges of abusing at least ten children in their care. Federal and city investigators then questioned dozens of children at the day care. They used 'dolls, gentle words and a quiet approach'. More children reported being abused sexually, increasing the total to 30. Three more day care facilities also were investigated for sexual abuse. On August 11, 1984, federal funds were ended to the Head Start preschool program at the Praca Day Care Center and three employees had been arrested. In June 1985, the day care facility was reopened with new sponsorship. In January 1986, Albert Algerin, employed at the Praca Day Care center, was sentenced to 50 years for rape and sexual abuse. In May, Praca employee Jesus Torres, a former teacher's aide was sentenced to 40 years. Praca employee Franklin Beauchamp had his case overturned by the New York Court of Appeals during May 1989. All five convictions were ultimately reversed. =Wee Care Nursery School= In Maplewood, New Jersey, during April 1985, Margaret Kelly Michaels was indicted for 299 offenses in connection with the sexual assault of 33 children. Michaels denied the charges. \\"The prosecution produced expert witnesses who said that almost all the children displayed symptoms of sexual abuse.\\" Prosecution witnesses testified that the children \\"had regressed into such behavior as bed-wetting and defecating in their clothing. The witnesses said the children became afraid to be left alone or to stay in the dark.\\" Some of the other teachers testified against her. \\"The defense argued that Michaels did not have the time or opportunity to go to a location where all the activities could have taken place without someone seeing her.\\" Michaels was sentenced to 47 years in the \\"sex case\\". Michaels \\"told the judge that she was confident her conviction would be overturned on appeal\\". After five years in prison her appeal was successful and sentence was reversed by a New Jersey appeals court. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the appellate court's decision and declared \\"the interviews of the children were highly improper and utilized coercive and unduly suggestive methods\\". A three judge panel ruled she had been denied a fair trial, because \\"the prosecution of the case had relied on testimony that should have been excluded because it improperly used an expert's theory, called the child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome, to establish guilt\\". The original judge was also criticized \\"for the way in which he allowed the children to give televised testimony from his chambers\\". =Glendale Montessori= James Toward and Brenda Williams were accused of kidnapping and sexually abusing six boys who attended Glendale Montessori in Stuart, Florida, as preschoolers during 1986 and 1987. Investigators claimed to know as many as 60 victims, mostly from the ages 2 to 5. In 1988, Williams, an office manager, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. She pleaded no contest to sex and attempted kidnapping charges involving five boys and she was released from prison in 1993 after serving five years. In 1989, Toward, owner of Glendale Montessori School, pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse charges and received a 27-year sentence. While technically maintaining his innocence, he allowed a guilty plea to be entered against him, convicting him of molesting or kidnapping six boys. Toward was placed in involuntary commitment due to the Jimmy Ryce Act. Although he maintained his innocence, Toward said he plea-bargained to avoid an almost certain life sentence. =Little Rascals= In Edenton, North Carolina, in January 1989, a parent accused Bob Kelly of sexual abuse. During the next several months, investigations and therapy resulted in allegations against dozens of other adults in the town, culminating in the arrest of seven adults. Despite the severity of some of the alleged acts, parents noticed no abnormal behaviour in their children until after initial accusations were made. Bob Kelly's trial lasted eight months and on April 22, 1992, he was convicted of 99 out of 100 counts against him. In 1995, the North Carolina Court of Appeals granted new trials to two defendants, including Kelly. Charges were ultimately dismissed for both. The remainder of the defendants received a variety of sentences. =Dale Akiki= Dale Akiki, a developmentally-delayed man with Noonan syndrome, was accused of satanic ritual abuse during 1991. Akiki and his wife were volunteer babysitters at Faith Chapel in Spring Valley, California. The accusations started when a young girl told her mother that \\"[Akiki] showed me his penis,\\" after which the mother contacted the police. After interviews, nine other children accused Akiki of killing animals, such as a giraffe and an elephant, and drinking their blood in front of the children. He was found not guilty of the 35 counts of child abuse and kidnapping in his 1993 trial. In 1994, the San Diego County Grand Jury reviewed the Akiki cases and concluded there was no reason to pursue the theory of ritual abuse. On August 25, 1994, he filed a suit against the County of San Diego, Faith Chapel Church, and many others, which was settled for $2 million. Akiki's public defenders received the Public Defender of the Year award for their work defending Akiki. =Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial= Frances Keller and her husband, Dan Keller, both of Austin, Texas, were convicted of sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl in their care, and sentenced to 48 years in prison. They spent 21 years in prison until their release in 2013. The case began on August 15, 1991, when a 3-year-old girl told her mother that Dan Keller had spanked her. However, the ‚Äúallegation quickly morphed into an allegation of sexual abuse.‚Äù The mother and daughter were on their way to a scheduled appointment with the girl's therapist, Donna David-Campbell, who elicited details that included Keller defecating on her head and sexually assaulting her with a pen. During the time leading up to the trial, two other children from the day care offered similar accusations. According to the children, the couple served blood-laced Kool-Aid, and forced them to have videotaped sex with adults and other children. The Kellers, they said, sometimes wore white robes and lit candles before hurting them. The children also accused the Kellers of forcing them to watch or participate with the killing and dismemberment of cats, dogs, and a crying baby. Bodies were unearthed in cemeteries, and new holes dug to hide freshly killed animals and, once, an adult passer-by was shot and dismembered with a chain saw. The children recalled several airplane flights, including one to Mexico, where they were sexually abused by soldiers, before returning to Austin in time to meet their parents at the day care. The only physical evidence of abuse in the case was presented by Michael Mouw, a then-novice emergency room physician at Brackenridge Hospital, who examined the 3-year-old girl in 1991, on the night she first accused Dan Keller of abuse. Mouw testified at the Kellers' trial that he found ‚Äúdeformities‚Äîdescribed as possible lacerations to the hymen and a tear of the fourchette,‚Äù and constituted what he considered possible ‚Äúsigns of sexual abuse.‚Äù Mouw‚Äôs determination was confirmed by pediatrician Beth Nauert, who agreed at the time that the child had ‚Äúdeformities to her vaginal area that could be signs of sexual abuse.‚Äù However, Nauert would notably examine the child two weeks after Mouw, and ‚Äúfound no signs of any deformities.‚Äù Three years after the 1992 trial, Mouw attended a medical seminar hosted by Nauert that ‚Äúdetailed normal variations of female genitalia‚Äù in a slide presentation. Mouw stated that the presentation included a photo that was identical to what he had observed in the girl. In 2009, Mouw issued a reversal on his prior claims, after being contacted by The Austin Chronicle, as a part of their story titled ‚ÄúBelieving the Children‚Äù that covered the Kellers‚Äô case. Mouw stated that his erroneous medical testimony was caused by his ‚Äúlittle experience, if any formal education at all, in conducting sexual abuse examinations of children.‚Äù On November 26, 2013, the Travis County district attorney's office announced that Fran Keller, now age 63, was being released on bond and her husband, Dan Keller, who was convicted at the same time, would be released within a week as a result of a deal with their lawyers. \\"There is a reasonable likelihood that (the medical expert's) false testimony affected the judgment of the jury and violated Frances Keller's right to a fair trial,\\" said the district attorney. On June 20, 2017, the Travis County district attorney's office announced that the case against the Kellers had been dismissed, citing actual innocence. They were awarded $3.4 million in compensation from the state of Texas for the 21 years they spent in prison. =Wenatchee child abuse prosecutions= In Wenatchee, Washington, during 1994 and 1995, police and state social workers performed what was then termed the nation's most extensive child sex-abuse investigation. Forty-three adults were arrested on 29,726 charges of child sex abuse involving 60 children. Parents, Sunday school teachers and a pastor were charged, and many were convicted of abusing their own children or the children of others in the community. However, prosecutors were unable to provide any physical evidence of the charges. The main witness was the 13-year-old foster daughter of police officer Robert Perez, who had investigated the cases. A jury found the city of Wenatchee and Douglas County, Washington, negligent in the 1994‚Äì1995 investigations. In 2001, $3 million was awarded to a couple who had been accused wrongly as a result of the inquiry. =Christchurch Civic Cr√®che= Peter Ellis, a child-care worker at the Christchurch Civic Cr√®che in New Zealand, was found guilty of 16 counts of sexual abuse against children in 1992 and served seven years in jail. Four female co-workers were also arrested on 15 charges of abuse, but were released after these charges were dismissed. Peter Ellis has consistently denied any abuse, and the case is still considered controversial by many New Zealanders. =Martensville satanic sex scandal= In 1992 a mother in the central Saskatchewan city of Martensville alleged that a local woman who had a babysitting service and day care facility in her home had sexually abused her child. Police began an investigation, resulting in a sudden increase of allegations. More than a dozen persons, including five police officers from two different forces, were ultimately charged with more than 100 charges associated with participating with a Satanic cult named The Brotherhood of The Ram, which allegedly practiced ritualized sexual abuse of numerous children at a \\"Devil Church\\". The son of the day care owner was tried and found guilty, then a Royal Canadian Mounted Police task force assumed control of the investigation. It concluded the original investigation was motivated by \\"emotional hysteria\\". During 2003, defendants sued for wrongful prosecution. In 2004, Richard and Kari Klassen received $100,000 each, out of the $1.5 million compensation awarded for the malicious prosecution.

This version has articles and a total of edits have been made (live count). It has registered user accounts, out of which are active (defined as having performed an action on Wikipedia in the last 30 days), and administrators. Since 2013, the Croatian Wikipedia has received attention from international media for promoting a fascist worldview as well as bias against Serbs of Croatia and anti-LGBT propaganda by the means of historical revisionism and by negating or diluting the severity of crimes committed by the Usta≈°e regime. Apart from whitewashing the crimes and vices of World War II-era criminals, the same is done for contemporary Croatian politicians and public figures; this is supported through massive usage of unreliable sources. Throughout 2014, fewer than two dozen editors made more than 100 edits a month; around 150 made more than 5 edits a month. Over 750 articles are ranked as featured (). 2011 reliability analysis In a study by Kubelka and ≈†o≈°tariƒá from 2011, the reliability of the Croatian Wikipedia was compared to the Croatian Encyclopedia - the Croatian national encyclopedia. Twenty-four reviewers, experts in specific fields, analyzed a representative selection of articles according to the parameters of informativeness, accuracy of presented information, sufficiency, direction and objectivity. Articles were analyzed in 11 thematic categories: arts and culture; history and biographies; medicine and health; technology and applied science; geography; religion; science; mathematics and logic; philosophy; sport and society; and social sciences. Articles were sorted into categories using machine learning techniques, and feature weight statistics were calculated using tf‚Äìidf. A total of 500 articles in 250 pairs were randomly chosen and sorted into categories to serve as representative samples. In both samples facts were manually enumerated - 3015 from the Croatian Encyclopedia and 3315 from Croatian Wikipedia. Comparison for factual accuracy showed that for every error in the Croatian Encyclopedia 2.25 errors were found in Croatian Wikipedia. Analysis by individual categories showed that most errors in Croatian Wikipedia were in the philosophy category, where on average two errors in ten articles were found. The only category where the Croatian Encyclopedia had more errors was natural sciences, where the ratio was 1.25:0.75 in favor of Croatian Wikipedia. Of those factual errors, the ratio was 21:12 for major errors, and 34:23 for minor errors. The overall ratio for minor factual errors was thus lower, the only exception being the society and social sciences category, where the minor error ratio was 3:1. The reliability analysis for Croatian Wikipedia indicated that 74% of articles were error- free, and 11% had minor errors. Major factual errors were found in 5% of articles, while 4% of articles had both major and minor errors. Overall 85% of articles were deemed \\"satisfactory\\" (error-free and containing minor errors), while in comparison 92% of articles in the Croatian Encyclopedia achieved the same rating. Forty percent of articles in Croatian Wikipedia were assessed as sufficiently informative, as opposed to sixty-two percent of articles in the Croatian Encyclopedia. Sixteen percent of Croatian Wikipedia articles were assessed as \\"insufficiently informative\\", as opposed to five percent of articles from the Croatian Encyclopedia. The criterion of objectivity measured the neutral point of view in articles; 91% of Croatian Wikipedia articles were assessed as being neutral, as opposed to 98% in the Croatian Encyclopedia. Two percent of Croatian Wikipedia articles were assessed as non-neutral, as opposed to zero in the Croatian Encyclopedia. According to their subjective preference, reviewers chose 53% of articles in the Croatian Encyclopedia as their preferred article version, while only 19.5% of Wikipedia articles were preferred, with 27% of articles being assessed as equal in quality. Controversy about right-wing bias = Media reports about bias = Croatian Wikipedia sitenotice that translates to \\"official and public refutation of yellow journalism by Jutarnji list\\" In September 2013, complaints about right-wing bias of administrators and editors on the Croatian Wikipedia began to receive attention from the media, following the launch of a Facebook page titled Razotkrivanje sramotne hr.wikipedije () which was created with the intent of bringing attention to the issue. According to Jurica Paviƒçiƒá, a professor at the University of Split and Jutarnji list columnist, the gradual takeover of the Croatian Wikipedia was started in 2009 by \\"a small group of conservative administrators\\" who blocked editors for having \\"liberal- to-moderate views on controversial topics\\". Reported examples of bias include historical revisionism such as watering-down and denial of the crimes committed by the Ustashe regime, and equating anti-fascism with forms of totalitarianism. Other issues included the bias against Serbs of Croatia and the LGBT population.Trolls hijack Wikipedia to turn articles against gays, Gay Star NewsTko prepravlja LGBT Hrvatsku na Wikipediji? Editors who tried to remove the biased sections were reportedly being harassed by administrators and quickly received permanent blocks under various pretexts. The issue was reported by Croatia's daily Jutarnji list and even made its print edition's front page on 11 September 2013. =Government reaction= Two days later, Croatia's Minister of Science, Education and Sports, ≈Ωeljko Jovanoviƒá, called for pupils and students in Croatia to avoid using the Croatian Wikipedia. In an interview given to Novi list, Jovanoviƒá said that \\"the idea of openness and relevance as a knowledge source that Wikipedia could and should represent has been completely discredited ‚Äì which, for certain, has never been the goal of Wikipedia's creators nor the huge number of people around the world who share their knowledge and time using that medium. Croatian pupils and students have been wronged by this, so we have to warn them, unfortunately, that a large part of the content of the Croatian version of Wikipedia is not only dubious but also [contains] obvious forgeries, and therefore we invite them to use more reliable sources of information, which include Wikipedia in English and in other major languages of the world.\\" Jovanoviƒá has also commented on the Croatian Wikipedia editors ‚Äì calling them a \\"minority group that has usurped the right to edit the Croatian-language Wikipedia\\". Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales said that complaints about the bias of the Croatian Wikipedia were \\"nothing new\\" but that Jovanoviƒá's denunciation was alarming. Wales also reiterated his opinion that the existence of separate Croatian and Serbian Wikipedias, both written in Serbo-Croatian, is wrong. =Interviews with historians= In an interview given to Index.hr, Robert Kureliƒá, a professor of history at the Juraj Dobrila University of Pula, has commented that \\"the Croatian Wikipedia is only a tool used by its administrators to promote their own political agendas, giving false and distorted facts\\". As two particularly prominent examples he listed the Croatian Wikipedia's coverage of the term Istrijanstvo (Istrian regionalism), defined as a \\"movement fabricated to reduce the number of Croats\\", and antifa≈°izam (anti-fascism), which according to him is defined as the opposite of what it really means. Kureliƒá further advised \\"that it would be good if a larger number of people got engaged and started writing on Wikipedia\\", because \\"administrators want to exploit high- school and university students, the most common users of Wikipedia, to change their opinions and attitudes, which presents a serious issue\\". Snje≈æana Koren, a historian at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, has judged the disputed articles as \\"biased and malicious, partly even illiterate\\", in an interview with Croatian news agency HINA. She further added that \\"These are the types of articles you can find on the pages of fringe organizations and movements, but there should be no place for that on Wikipedia\\", expressing doubts on the ability of its authors to distinguish good from evil. Koren concludes that the ulterior motive of such writings is to rehabilitate the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi Germany puppet state, and that \\"there is no other way to characterize such efforts than as Ustashi movement\\". The Croatian Wikipedia page on the Jasenovac concentration camp is a prime example of its distortions. The Croatian version of the page refers to the WWII Jasenovac concentration camp as a ‚Äúcollection camp‚Äù and labour camp, downplays the crimes committed there as well as the number of victims and relies on right-wing media and private blogs as references. Hrvoje Klasiƒá, also a historian at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb, stated to the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network that although Jasenovac was in part a labour camp, referring to it as that alone is \\"misleading\\", arguing that referring to Jasenovac as simply a collection and labour camp is to use \\"the same language as Ustasa propaganda\\" and also added that \\"a number of articles and topics are done in a completely revisionist manner [on the Croatian Wikipedia], with highly emphasised nationalist and, I would dare to say, pro-Ustasa sentiment\\".

History The ruler of Avathi Mallabiregowda's son Marigowda was hunting one day in Kodimanchanahalli forest. A rabbit stood in front of the fierce hunting dogs without fear. Seeing this, ruler was elated and told his son that the strength of the rabbit is due to the valour of the region's citizenry. As such the ruler took permission from King of Vijaynagar and built an elaborate fort and formed a city which is now known as Chickballapur. Baichegowda, King of Mysore later attacked the fort but had to withdraw due to the valiant efforts of the Chikkaballapura citizens and aid from the Marathas. Sri Dodda Byregowda who came to power after Baichegowda acquired the land, which was taken by Mysore king. In 1762 during the ruling of Chikkappanayaka, Hyder Ali captured the town for a period of 3 months. Then Chikkappanayaka agreed to pay 5-lakhs pagodas, and then the army was taken back. After this, Chikkappa Nayaka with the help of Murariraya of Guthy tried to restore his powers. He was hiding at Nandi Hills along with Chikkappa Nayaka. Immediately, Hyder Ali acquired Chikkaballapur and other places and arrested Chikkappa Nayaka. Then with interfere of Lord Corn Wallis, Chikkaballapur was handed over to Narayanagowda. After knowing this, Tippu Sultan again acquired Chikkaballapur . In 1791 British occupied Nandi & left Narayanagowda to rule the town. Due to this treachery, a fight broke out between the Britishers and Tippu Sultan. Narayanagowda lost his administration. Later, the British defeated Tippu in a bitter battle which led to tremendous loss of life on both sides. The citizens of Chikkaballapur, however, refused to be subjugated and maintained their warrior pride. Chikkaballapur later came under the administration of Wodeyars of Mysore, who later merged with the present state of Karnataka. Demographics India census, Chikkaballapur had a population of 191,122.

Beckwourth Pass is located at the eastern edge of Sierra Valley at Chilcoot-Vinton, California in Plumas County, east of Portola, California and northwest of Reno, Nevada. California State Route 70 crosses over Beckwourth Pass and the Feather River Route of the former Western Pacific, now Union Pacific Railroad beneath it via the Chilcoot Tunnel. Route 70 and the railroad line provide an alternate route between Sacramento, California and Reno, Nevada when Interstate 80 and the Overland Route, which cross the Sierra Nevada near Donner Pass, are impassable due to winter storms. History James Beckwourth is credited with the discovery of Beckwourth Pass in 1850. In 1851, he improved what was originally a Native American path into Sierra Valley to create his Beckwourth Trail. The trail ran from Truckee Meadows (what is now known as Sparks, Nevada) through the pass into California and on to Marysville. In late summer of 1851, James Beckwourth led the first wagon train of settlers along the Beckwourth Trail into Marysville. Between 1851 and 1854, the Beckwourth trail was frequently traveled; however, in 1854, use dropped sharply when the Beckwourth Trail became a toll road. The toll cost to move a ton of freight from Bidwell Bar to Quincy was about $18. This made using the Beckwourth Road an expensive enterprise and the use of the Beckwourth Trail declined. Between 1895 and 1916, the pass was used by the Sierra Valley & Mohawk Railway narrow gauge. The abandoned right-of-way is still visible on the south, and eastern slope of the pass. In 1906, the Chilcoot Tunnel at was constructed beneath Beckwourth Pass by the Western Pacific Railroad as part of its Feather River Route. This line is now owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1937, a bronze plaque was erected at Beckwourth Pass by the Native Daughters of the Golden West to commemorate the discoverer and the pioneers who passed along the trail. On August 8, 1939, Beckwourth Pass was designated as California Historical Landmark Number 336.

It moves away from her previous stories about vampires and witches to tell a ghost story. Plot summary The book is set in numerous places, including Vienna, New Orleans and Rio de Janeiro. The novel tells the story of three people: a middle-aged woman yearning to become a musician, a ghostly violinist, and the ghost of Beethoven. The story begins with Triana, who apparently becomes insane due to the death of her second husband, Karl, who had AIDS. Her first husband was Lev, with whom Triana had a daughter. Stefan, the ghost, appears the day Karl dies and plays his Stradivarius (s long Strad) (apparently also a ghost). Triana secludes herself in her house for several days without informing anyone of Karl's death. The book tells the story of both Triana and Stefan. Stefan takes Triana in a travel through time, visiting scenes from his life and his afterlife in an attempt to reclaim his violin, which had been taken by Triana. Stefan had many mentors including Beethoven and Paganini, but it is Beethoven whom Stefan cherished the most. After Stefan's story is \\"told\\" Triana returns to her rightful time but not to New Orleans where the story began but to Vienna, and now seemingly possessing a talent to improvise in the violin. The ghost of this great musician is shown wabout two times in the novel, the first one in a scene where Stefan's house in Vienna is burning, and the second one almost at the end where Beethoven appears in modern Vienna in the hotel room where Triana was staying. With Triana still in possession of the strad, Stefan continues his attempts to reclaim the violin but to no avail, until finally, after achieving success with her improvisations it is in Brazil that Triana returns the violin to his rightful owner and Stefan finally crosses over. 1997 American novels Novels by Anne Rice American horror novels Alfred A.

It refers to the eastern portion of Cape Breton County fronting the Atlantic Ocean on the southeastern part of Cape Breton Island. Geography The area comprising Industrial Cape Breton includes the following communities within the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and earned its name from the various industrial activities relating to steelmaking, heavy water production, coal mining, and spin-off industries. =Northside= Referring to the north side of Sydney Harbour. * northeastern tip of Boularderie Island at Point Aconi * Bras d'Or * Florence * Sydney Mines * North Sydney =Southside= * Sydney * New Victoria * South Bar * New Waterford * Lingan * Dominion * Glace Bay * Reserve Mines * Donkin * Port Morien * Broughton History =Early mining= The southeastern part of Cape Breton Island is home to the Sydney Coal Field, an extensive underground coal seam extending at an angle from the shore beneath the seafloor of the Cabot Strait. This large deposit of high- sulphur coal was first extracted by French soldiers from Fortress of Louisbourg in 1720 at nearby Port Morien. A major coal industry developed during the 19th century, becoming the largest energy project in British North America at its height of production. The largest integrated steel mill in the British Commonwealth was constructed on Sydney Harbor in 1901. The coal and steel industries went into decline following World War II and never fully recovered. They were nationalized by the federal and provincial governments during the late 1960s with the intention of closing them by the 1980s, however production increased in the 1970s as a result of rising world oil and steel prices. By the 1990s, environmental degradation (see Sydney Tar Ponds) and economic ruin was facing the industrial Cape Breton region. The steel mill and last coal mine were closed in 2001 and the area has been struggling to adapt. While the urban area of eastern Cape Breton County influenced by the coal and steel industries came to be referred to as \\"Industrial Cape Breton\\", many rural communities in the rest of Cape Breton Island have been relatively stable economically, largely due to the mix of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and a growing tourism industry as a result of the spectacular scenery found throughout the island. =General Mining Association= General Mining Association's steam locomotive 'Samson' at Albion Mines, Pictou County. The locomotive was built by Timothy Hackworth of Shildon, County Durham, UK and went into service on the first part of the new railway in 1839. In 1826 all mining rights in Nova Scotia were transferred from the Duke of York to a monopoly named the General Mining Association. The GMA developed some mines in the Eastern Cape Breton but mostly concentrated on the mainland part of Nova Scotia. In 1858, the GMA's monopoly was broken and many American-financed mining companies were developed in the area, particularly in Glace Bay, New Waterford, Sydney Mines and surrounding areas. =SCOTIA and DOMCO= In the 1890s, two large conglomerates were formed; the Dominion Coal Company (DOMCO) merged all the mines on the south side of Sydney Harbour and built the Sydney & Louisburg Railway with its headquarters in Glace Bay, to transport coal from the mines to the ports at Sydney and Louisbourg. At its high point, the Dominion Coal Company operated eleven mines in the town of Glace Bay which were responsible for forty percent of Canada's coal production. The GMA was transformed into Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company (SCOTIA) and developed mines on the north side of Sydney Harbour. In 1899, DOMCO financed the construction of a large integrated steel mill in Sydney's Whitney Pier neighbourhood, which was named Dominion Iron and Steel Company (DISCO); the DISCO mill smelted iron ore mined in Bell Island, Newfoundland. SCOTIA also built a steel mill in Sydney Mines. The booming economy in the Industrial area experienced immigration from Newfoundland and Eastern Europe to fuel the labour demand. =BESCO= In 1914 the SCOTIA steel mill was closed and in 1920 both DOMCO/DISCO and SCOTIA were merged into a new company named British Empire Steel and Coal Company (BESCO). _The copyright of this section might be in question and is likely from UMWA material._ =DOSCO= BESCO was reorganized in 1930 as Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO). At one point, DOSCO was the largest private employer (in terms of the number of employees) in the nation. While employment in coal and steel peaked in 1913 in the industrial Cape Breton area, production increased until the early 1940s as a result of mechanization and increased consumption during World War II. Following the war, coal production went into a decline as newer and cheaper open-pit mines were opened in western North America, railways switched to diesel fuel for locomotives, and nuclear energy and hydroelectricity gained increased acceptance. In the mid-1960s, DOSCO fell into financial difficulty as coal and steel usage continued to decline. DOSCO announced that its mines had 15 years of production left and that its steel mill was uneconomic to operate without significant modernization. In 1965‚Äì1966, a federal Royal Commission of Inquiry called the \\"Donald Commission\\" recommended that the federal government create a Crown corporation to take over operation of DOSCO mines with the aim being to gradually wean the industrial area economy off natural resources and into a more diversified service-oriented economy. =DEVCO and SYSCO= On July 7, 1967 the Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO) was created and on March 30, 1968 all DOSCO mines were expropriated for $12 million by DEVCO. At the same time, the provincial government formed the Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO) and took over DOSCO's steel mill, with the aim being to gradually control the shut down of this industry. DEVCO brought in new tourism initiatives throughout Cape Breton Island and funded various community economic development programs, however politics and other factors such as the 1973 oil crisis brought about by the OPEC embargo following the Yom Kippur War saw demand for coal increase dramatically, particularly for electrical generation. The federal government reversed course and chose to expand, rather than retract, the production of coal and opened new mines and modernized its DOSCO-inherited properties to serve new electrical generating stations. It is significant to note that until 1992, Nova Scotia Power was a crown corporation, and as such treated locally produced coal with preference. During the 1980s the provincial government also modernized the steel mill, however both coal and steel encountered production and financial difficulties in the 1990s and DEVCO and SYSCO both decommissioned their operations by the turn of the century or shortly thereafter. The last underground coal mine on Cape Breton Island closed in November 2001. =Post-industrial phase= Industrial Cape Breton's economy faces significant challenges with unemployment and out-migration, as well as ongoing efforts to clean up the Sydney Tar Ponds; a legacy of DOSCO, and later DEVCO, producing coke to fuel the blast furnaces at the steel mill. The Muggah Creek estuary opening onto Sydney Harbour near the coke ovens site is contaminated with a variety of coal-based wastes. After extensive public consultation and technical study, a CDN$400-million cleanup plan, jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments awaits further environmental assessment. In a classic case of adjustment from an industrial to post- industrial economy, the region is forecast to undergo a rapid depopulation as workers with limited skills and financial means are migrating to Alberta energy projects or Ontario and U.S. urban centres, while young people and entrepreneurs are leaving due to the shrinking population and lack of economic opportunity left in the void. It has been projected that the Cape Breton Regional Municipality will depopulate from 100,000 residents in 2006 to approximately 75,000 by 2020. Currently there are no coal mining operations on Cape Breton Island, aside from numerous bootleg mines . Record world energy prices during 2004-2005 resulted in plans to reopen an abandoned colliery at Donkin. Xstrata Coal, a subsidiary of Switzerland's Xstrata Plc Group, was awarded the right to develop the Donkin colliery by the provincial government, and re-opened the mine in 2017, however due to several Cave-ins the mine closed in 2020.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/donkin-coal-mine-in- cape-breton-closing-permanently-1.5514689 The Donkin project had been estimated by promoters that it would create hundreds of jobs for Industrial Cape Breton. It is also envisioned that the Donkin project would help improve the fortunes of the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway, whose railway line from Port Hawkesbury to Sydney has been unprofitable since the closure of the coal mines and steel plant.

The mission is to explore the ever-changing relationship between humans and whales through inquiry-based education and interpretation of artifacts that emphasize the cultural, scientific and environmental significance of Long Island and the Sea. We help members and visitors make informed decisions about our marine environment. The Museum serves 20,000 visitors annually and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Located in a historic 19th century waterside village on the North Shore of Suffolk County, the Whaling Museum Society was founded in 1936, with the Museum opening its front doors in 1942. Current exhibit space is 2500 square feet, which includes an educational workshop. The Museum is the only facility in New York State open year-round which focuses on the prominent whaling history of the region and its meaningful applications in today's world. The museum holds about 6,000 documents and artifacts from Cold Spring Harbor and other Long Island whaling towns. Highlights of the collection include New York State‚Äôs only fully equipped 19th-century whaleboat with original gear and one of the most notable scrimshaw collections in the northeast. Additional displays include whaling implements, ship‚Äôs gear, navigational aids, ship models and maritime art. The library and archival collection contains 2,800 primary and secondary volumes and manuscript material from the Cold Spring whaling fleet, ship‚Äôs logs, journals and business correspondence of the Cold Spring Whaling Company, family documents dealing with maritime commerce on Long Island, records of the Long Island coastwise trade under sail and records from the Cold Spring Harbor Customs House (1798 until 1908). The museum hosts educational events and exhibitions year-round, including films, lectures, performances, and special events, many of which creatively connect the subject of whaling to other subjects in art, science, and culture. The museum's education department runs an extensive \\"Museum to You\\" program, as well as camp weeks during school breaks.  Museum collection  The Museum's collection attests to Long Island's maritime heritage based in the whaling industry. The majority of the Museum's collections were donated over time, starting as a community repository from the Museum's founding in 1936. Over the past 80 years, the Museum has steadily acquired an extensive and varied collection which, when possible, are integrated into the Museum's public programming. Totaling 6,000 pieces, most pieces speak to the 19th century whaling industry, specifically Long Island whaling, as well as the local history of Cold Spring Harbor and its growth as a maritime port. The collection speaks volumes about Long Island's vibrant whaling past and the process by which America was put on the economic world map, including letters recording daring rescues at sea, photographs showing the economic growth of whaling villages, crew lists with signatures of multicultural crew members, iron harpoons revealing the evolution of innovation, glass bottles of amber whale oil which facilitated the Industrial Revolution, and modern whaling tools which pushed whale populations to the brink of extinction. These artifacts show the complexity of whaling and its regional importance ‚Äì and more importantly, its timely lessons for today: these artifacts offer important messages learned from environmental and economic choices of the past. The collection includes: * Scrimshaw: 500 scrimshaw items crafted by whalers at sea, one of the true American folk arts, including decorative pieces on teeth and tusks. The collection excels in its variety of hundreds of utilitarian pieces such as sewing boxes, swifts, busks, fids, and jagging wheels ‚Äì a collection considered one of the finest in the northeast. * Whalecraft, ship gear, and navigational aids: 275 tools, including a 19th-century whaleboat from the Long Island whaleship the Daisy (and the only fully equipped whaleboat with its original gear on display in New York State), with a collection of tools, trypot, figureheads, and navigational tools. * Archives: containing 95% of the existing manuscript material from the Cold Spring Harbor whaling fleet (documenting 44 voyages of 9 ships from 1836 to 1862), including 15 ships logs, 12 journals, and business correspondence; 90% of the records from the local Customs House (1798-1908); records of the Long Island coastwise trade under sail; photos of crewmembers, vessels, and ports; family scrapbooks. * Richmond Collection: documents, letters, receipts, shipping lists, and manuscripts preserved from the Cold Spring Harbor ship The Richmond, wrecked on the Bering Straits in 1849. The archive reveals the Richmond's significant history as the focus of a legal judgment in maritime salvage law. Acquired in 2012. * Models: 12 detailed models of whaling ships, including one by the master ship model maker Henry Culver; a large diorama of Cold Spring Harbor in 1850 (48 inches √ó 72 inches), painstakingly completed in 1970. * Marine art: 150 paintings, lithographs, and daguerreotypes depicting whaling scenes; works by Currier & Ives, S.A. Mount, C. Ashley, W. Brandford, and watercolors of local ships by E.F. Tufnell. * Daily life: 6 costumes, 50 whale oil lamps and candleholders, accessories, and objects of daily living in the 1850s donated by local whaling families; ship in a bottle, early 19th century glass flasks, kitchen tools, and prescription bottles. * Natural history: 25 skeletal whale bones; 2 narwhal tusks; sperm whale jaw; orca skull; ear bones; blubber sample; other biological specimens from ocean life, including coral. * Hewlett Collection: acquired in 1989 from the state of John D. Hewlett including over 200 photographs, 300 pieces of correspondence pertaining to the growth of Cold Spring Harbor as a maritime community, Edward Lange landscapes, portraits by S. A. Mount of local citizens, ledgers from local industries including grist mills, saw mills, and shipyards, providing a wealth of research. * Hoie Collection: 24 whaling- themed watercolor paintings by the locally celebrated Long Island watercolorist Claus Hoie (1911-2007), donated to the museum in 2012. History In 1932 a small number of residents of Cold Spring Harbor, NY commissioned a monument commemorating the village's earlier days as a whaling port. A boulder was dredged from the harbor and erected on the village square and lists the names of the nine vessels in the fleet. In later years the monument was moved to the museum's property, where it remains today.

The ND-500 was a 32-bit superminicomputer delivered in 1981 by Norsk Data. It relied on a ND-100 to do housekeeping tasks and run the OS, SINTRAN III. A configuration could feature up to four ND-500 CPUs in a shared-memory configuration.  Hardware implementations  The ND-500 architecture lived through four distinct implementations. Each implementation was sold under a variety of different model numbers. ND also sold multiprocessor configurations, naming them ND-580/n and an ND-590n, where n represented the number of CPUs in a given configuration, 2, 3, or 4. =ND-500/1= Sold as the ND-500, ND-520, ND-540, and ND-560. =ND-500/2= Sold as the ND-570, ND-570/CX, and the ND-570/ACX. =ND-505= A 28-bit version of the ND-500 machine.

Software LED was a programmer's editor by Norsk Data running on the ND-500 computers running Sintran III. It featured automatic indenting, pretty- printing of source code, and integration with the compiler environment. It was sold as an advanced alternative to PED. There are several remaining copies, and it is installed on the NODAF public access ND-5700. In 1982-83 Logica PLC in London undertook a project, on behalf of ND, to port UNIX 4.2BSD to the ND-500.

Therefore all I/O had to go through the ND-100 which proved very inefficient. For example, running vi on the ND-500 brought the ND-100 to its knees. The purpose of the effort was so that ND could sell the 500 to CERN, who were buying VAX's. But the ND-500 wasn't able to meet CERN's goals.

An implementation is often integrated into the operating system's file IO subsystem. Typically a parent program opens anonymous pipes, and creates a new process that inherits the other ends of the pipes, or creates several new processes and arranges them in a pipeline. Full-duplex (two-way) communication normally requires two anonymous pipes. Pipelines are supported in most popular operating systems, from Unix and DOS onwards, and are created using the \\"\`\`\\" character in many shells.  Unix  Pipelines are an important part of many traditional Unix applications and support for them is well integrated into most Unix-like operating systems. Pipes are created using the \`pipe\` system call, which creates a new pipe and returns a pair of file descriptors referring to the read and write ends of the pipe. Many traditional Unix programs are designed as filters to work with pipes.  Microsoft Windows  Like many other device IO and IPC facilities in the Windows API, anonymous pipes are created and configured with API functions that are specific to the IO facility. In this case \`CreatePipe\` is used to create an anonymous pipe with separate handles for the read and write ends of the pipe. Read and write IO operations on the pipe are performed with the standard IO facility API functions \`ReadFile\` and \`WriteFile\`. On Microsoft Windows, reads and writes to anonymous pipes are always blocking. In other words, a read from an empty pipe will cause the calling thread to wait until at least one byte becomes available or an end-of-file is received as a result of the write handle of the pipe being closed. Likewise, a write to a full pipe will cause the calling thread to wait until space becomes available to store the data being written. Reads may return with fewer than the number of bytes requested (also called a short read). New processes can inherit handles to anonymous pipes in the creation process.

It is located on the water's edge, at the southern end of the village of Summer Cove, on Kinsale harbour, County Cork, Ireland. First completed in 1682, Charles Fort was sometimes historically referred to as the \\"new fort\\" - to contrast with James' Fort (the \\"old fort\\") which had been built on the other side of Kinsale harbour before 1607. The fort is now operated as a heritage tourism site by the Heritage Ireland arm of the Office of Public Works. Construction and history  Charles Fort was built on the site of an earlier stronghold known as Ringcurran Castle. The Ringcurran defences had featured prominently during the Siege of Kinsale in 1601. The new fort, which is named after Charles II, was designed by the Surveyor-general Sir William Robinson - architect of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. Additional site structures are attributed to engineer Captain Thomas Philips. The fort was built between 1677 and 1682 to a design which included elements similar to star fortifications; a layout specifically designed to resist attack by cannon. It became known as the \\"new fort\\" - to contrast with James' Fort (the \\"old fort\\") which had been built on the other side of Kinsale harbour between 1602 and 1607. With a focus on seaward defence, the landward and inland bastions of the fort are overlooked by higher ground. This weakness was of critical importance when the fort was subject to a 13-day siege in 1690 during the Williamite War in Ireland. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (then 1st Earl) besieged Cork and captured Kinsale and its forts. Repairs were made following the siege. Seaward embrasures and lighthouse of Charles Fort An early lighthouse was established here in the 17th century by Robert Reading, and additional works (including the development of internal \\"citadel\\" defences) were added through the 18th and 19th centuries. The fort remained in use as a British Army barracks for two hundred years afterwards, before being relinquished by British forces following the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. The fort fell out of use after being burned by retreating anti-Treaty forces during the Irish Civil War in 1922. Tourism development The complex remained largely derelict for some time, but was named a National Monument of Ireland in 1971. Over the coming decades several sections of the fort were restored by D√∫chas, the Irish heritage service. Restoration and development of the complex was later taken-over by the Office of Public Works (OPW) - including the development of an exhibition space in the former commander's quarters. Charles Fort is one of the most visited OPW sites in the region, attracting in excess of 86,000 visitors in 2015.

The nearest town is Hucknall which is immediately to the south-west. The village grew up around the mills on the River Leen, from which Linby's name is derived. Small streams known as Linby Docks run on both sides of the main street. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 232. History In the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870‚Äì72) John Marius Wilson described Linby: The local parish church is dedicated to St. Michael and is a Grade II* listed building. Containing a number of features which date to the 13th century, the church has been extended several times, including restorations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There are two crosses in the village. The \\"Top Cross\\", a Grade II listed structure, is dated to the 14th century and was restored in the late 19th century. The \\"Bottom Cross\\" is inscribed with the date 1663, and may have been dedicated to the restoration of King Charles II. Linby won Nottinghamshire's \\"best kept village\\" award in 2013. Administration From 1894 to 1974 the village was part of Basford Rural District. It was then transferred to Gedling Borough. However, a small part of the parish had been transferred to Hucknall Urban District Council in 1935. Linby is included in the Hidden Valleys area of Nottinghamshire. Transport The Linby Trail is a 2 km stretch of the National Cycle Route starting at the village and finishing at nearby Newstead Village. The ex-Great Northern Leen Valley line at Linby whare it passed beneath the ex-Great Central Main Line Three railway lines once passed through Linby, with stations on two of them. The first was the Midland Railway (later part of the LMS) line from Nottingham to Mansfield and Worksop, closed to passengers on 12 October 1964 though partly retained as a freight route serving collieries at Annesley. In the 1990s this line was reopened to passengers in stages, the section through Linby in 1993, but Linby station did not reopen with it. The second line was the Great Northern Railway (later part of the LNER) route serving many of the same places as the Midland. It closed to passengers on 14 September 1931 but remained in use for freight until 25 March 1968. The Linby station on this line had closed long before, on 1 July 1916. The third line was the Great Central Railway (also later part of the LNER), the last main line ever built from the north of England to London, opened on 15 March 1899. The stretch through Linby (which crossed over both the other lines), closed completely on 5 September 1966, but there had never been a Linby station on this line.

Its promoters hoped it would form the only railway between central Scotland and England, but it lost out to rival companies. It opened in stages between 1846 and 1850, and on completion of its line it merged with the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway. The combined company took the name Glasgow & South Western Railway (G&SWR;). The G&SWR; formed an alliance with the English Midland Railway and for many years express passenger trains ran between Glasgow and London over the routes. The line is open today, continuing to form part of the Glasgow - Kilmarnock - Dumfries - Carlisle line; but that has diminished in importance and is now a secondary route. Passenger services are operated by Abellio ScotRail. History =A line into Ayrshire, and later to England?= In the 18th century, tracked systems called plateways were constructed in areas of Scotland where minerals were extracted; the need was to convey the heavy product to a river or a harbour, in many cases over a relatively short distance, so that water-borne transport could take it to market. By 1830 the technology had progressed and railway lines using edge rails (in which the vehicle wheels, rather than the plate \\"rails\\" had flanges for guidance) became commonplace. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway of 1826 may be regarded as the pioneer in showing the way forward.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, The Liverpool & Manchester Railway opened in 1830 and demonstrated that inter-city lines could be profitable, and that passenger carriage could be a prime source of business and not just an adjunct to mineral haulage. As railways in England began to develop into a network, business people in Scotland started to think not merely of internal railways, but of eventual connection with England. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, to link Birmingham (and therefore London) with Manchester, it was possible to consider that railways might soon link central Scotland and the south of England. In 1835 a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire was being actively promoted, and a survey to be commissioned from John Miller, and he proposed a route from to Ayr and Kilmarnock. There was a clear view that this could be the start of a line to Carlisle, there linking up with whatever English railway might reach that city. The line into Ayrshire received the royal assent on 15 July 1837, and was called the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;).David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, The company's first shareholders' meeting (while the line was still under construction) was told that \\"the Glasgow & Ayrshire Railway (GPK&AR;) will at no very distant period form part of the great trunk line to England\\".Directors' assertion at Shareholders' meeting, 9 March 1838, quoted in Ross, page 17 The GPK&AR; opened its line to Ayr in 1840, and to Kilmarnock on 4 April 1843. However the process of construction had been difficult, and getting money from subscribersPersons could subscribe to shares and only needed to pay a small percentage of the face value at once; in times when it seemed that easy profits were to be made from railway investments, many people made very ambitious subscriptions; in tighter money conditions later, they found themselves unwilling, or unable, to respond to calls for further sums due on the subscription. had proved difficult due to the tight financial conditions prevailing; moreover other priorities arose for the company, in particular the building of branches in Ayrshire for tactical reasons: to discourage rival companies from entering the area that the GPK&AR; considered its own. Accordingly, the idea of the GPK&AR; extending to Carlisle took a lower priority. It was not only the GPK&AR; who considered making a trunk line southwards: a strong body of opinion considered that a route directly over the hills of the Southern Uplands was superior, with a shorter mileage. This became known as the proposed Annandale route to Carlisle, but Kilmarnock was not an ideal starting point to go that way. The GPK&AR;'s supporters intended a line from Kilmarnock via Dumfries, and this was the proposed Nithsdale route. Although longer, this had much easier gradients‚Äîat the time engine power was considered to be inadequate for a hillier route‚Äîand would go through more populous districts, bringing in more intermediate business; in addition it would be cheaper to build. Meanwhile, many people supported an east coast route that would reach England from Edinburgh by way of Dunbar and Berwick.Campbell Highet, The Glasgow and South Western Railway, The Oakwood Press, Lingfield, 1965 =Controversy over routes= The Annandale and Nithsdale routes compared On 15 March 1841Highet says \\"in 1840\\" on page 15 but this refers to an interim report. a reportCommission on Railway Communication between London, Dublin, Edinburgh and Glasgow, Third Report on the relative merits of the routes was submitted by two commissioners appointed by Parliament, Professor Peter Barlow (of the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich) and Sir Frederick Smith, the first Inspector-General of Railways for the Board of Trade. There were sixteen variations of proposed route; the Commissioners were frustrated that \\"the information supplied to us [by the respective promoters] has been very incomplete\\" and in fact they were unable to get detailed figures of costs and possible income for the Nithsdale route. The commissioners took the view that only one Anglo-Scottish line was viable: \\"We are led to believe ... that the amount of traffic which ... may be expected, is not such a would be likely to afford an adequate return for the construction of two distinct lines of railway, the one from Darlington to Edinburgh, and the other from Lancaster to Glasgow.\\"Barlow and Smith Report, quoted in Robertson, pages 278 - 282 They declared that the Anandale route was to be preferred, but \\"the promoters must prove their bona fide intention to complete the English portion of the line, otherwise preference would be given to the East Coast route\\". However their report was not binding: it was hedged with numerous qualifications, and by no means closed the matter. In particular they stated that if they had considered two routes in Scotland practicable, they would have recommended the east coast route and the decidedly superior mechanical properties of the Nithsdale route might well have offset the greater length. In any case the railways in England did not yet extend north of Lancaster. The Commissioners' report had the effect of suspending the enthusiasm for cross-border railways for a period, and killing off a few fanciful schemes, but after three years when interest in such lines was resumed, the report was completely irrelevant. =Definite proposals at last= So interest did resume, and on 9 March 1844 the provisional committee of the Glasgow & Carlisle Railway Company (GD&CR;) met. There was considerable overlap in membership with the GPK&AR;, and the latter helped out with the committee's expenses at first. A critical need was to generate promises of subscriptions, and to distinguish this proposal from the Annandale route (now being identified as the Caledonian Railway), which was also being heavily promoted once again: the name was soon changed to the Glasgow Dumfries and Carlisle Railway, reflecting also the interests of Dumfries and other more southerly subscribers. The capital would be ¬£1.3 million. This proposal went to Parliament as a Bill in the 1845 session, but so did the Caledonian scheme. Locomotive power had improved in the recent few years, so that the gradients over Annandale were less significant; and the Annandale route could fork as it reached northwards and serve Edinburgh as well as Glasgow. Parliament was still unwilling to sanction two major lines, and on 31 July 1845 the Caledonian Railway won the battle: its Annandale route received the Royal Assent. However, in the same session the GPK&AR; got approval to extend southwards from Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh, south of the mining town of Old Cumnock. The supporters of the Nithsdale scheme did not give up, and resolved to try again in the 1846 session. They dissolved the original GD&CR; and established a new one under the same name; the route would now join the Caledonian line at Gretna, rather than running independently to Carlisle. With several new branches added to the scheme, the capital was once again to be ¬£1.3 million. However it emerged that the British and Irish Union Railway was proposing a line to connect Carlisle and Portpatrick, from where the short sea route to the north of Ireland started. The B&IUR; planned to run between Dumfries and Carlisle, along an alignment that the GD&CR; intended to use; the Caledonian Railway was also considering using this route. In fact in the 1846 session a huge number of railway schemes were being proposed, many of them fanciful, but most of them requiring attention to consider what strategies might be necessary to avoid loss of the GD&CR;'s own scheme. =And finally, authorisation= Most of these schemes fell away when the financial bubble burst, and on 13 August 1846 the Glasgow Dumfries and Carlisle Railway was authorised. Disastrously, the Act gave the Caledonian Railway rights to a \\"perpetual lease\\" of the line between Gretna and Annan. The first ordinary meeting of shareholders took place on 8 September 1846, and it was agreed that an objective was eventual amalgamation with the GPK&AR.; Money was desperately short, and contracts were let for construction of the main line beyond what funds were available to pay; the numerous branches included in the Act were still considered definite intentions, as was a long line from Dumfries to Portpatrick; there was no match between available money and the ambition of these schemes. The GPK&AR; was running its own railway and making a good profit, and it was persuaded to buy up unissued GD&CR; shares; immediate amalgamation was considered, but the GD&CR; was too demanding in its terms and the idea was postponed. Relations with the Caledonian Railway were more often hostile than friendly, and it was a considerable relief when the GD&CR; obtained an Act on 9 June 1847 repealing the authorisation for the CR to lease the Gretna to Annan section. =Opening, in stages= System map of the GD&CR; at completion The GD&CR; proceeded with construction contracts in a state of considerable financial difficulty, and on 21 August 1848 a special train for directors and their friends was run from Dumfries to Annan. The line opened to the public from Dumfries to Gretna on 23 August 1848; operation and provision of rolling stock was in the hands of the GPK&AR;, who also underwrote any loss, or profit, on the operation. Running arrangements into Carlisle had not been finalised, so the passenger trains only ran as far as Gretna, from where passengers could change trains and continue in Caledonian Railway trains. At Dumfries the station was a temporary structure south of Annan Road. On 15 October 1849, the line was opened from Dumfries to Closeburn, and on 20 May 1850, the final section was opened from Closeburn to Horsecleugh, where an end-on junction was made with the GPK&AR;, which opened from Auchinleck to that point on the same day.Stephenson Locomotive Society (SLS), The Glasgow and South Western Railway, 1850‚Äì1923, London, 1950 There was no station at Horsecleugh; it was probably an arbitrary boundary point. its location is thought to be at the Dumfries Road bridge.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain ‚Äî A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, The authorising Acts of Parliament of 1846 and 1847 had confirmed that the GD&CR; would merge with the GPK&AR; on completion of the GD&CR; line; in fact the GPK&AR; as senior partner absorbed the GD&CR;, and changed its name to the Glasgow & South Western Railway.Glasgow and South Western Railway Incorporation Act, 1847, paraphrased in SLS On 28 October 1850 therefore, the Glasgow and South Western railway started its existence, and the GD&CR; was dissolved. =The G&SWR;= The new company had finally won its battle for a through line, though it had lost the race for primacy; the Caledonian Railway had a much shorter route to Glasgow and Edinburgh, and the North British Railway had been running through trains from Edinburgh to London on the east coast route via Berwick-upon-Tweed for two years. On 26 June 1873 a line was opened from Barrhead to Kilmarnock, shortening the Glasgow to Kilmarnock run, and therefore the Glasgow to Carlisle run, considerably. The new company needed an English partner to make a viable service to London, and eventually it found one, when the Midland Railway built its line to Carlisle, opening in 1875/6. From that time a firm alliance was formed, and express passenger trains to London ran over the Dumfries line and via Leeds on the Midland line, reaching London at St Pancras station. The G&SWR; expanded south-westward from Glasgow, where more traffic‚Äîmineral as much as passenger‚Äîwas available than in the moorlands of Nithsdale. The G&SWR; continued in existence until the \\"grouping\\" of the main line railways in Great Britain, under the Railways Act 1921; the G&SWR;, together with the Caledonian Railway, became constituents of the London, Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS). In turn the LMS, together with other railways, was nationalised and the Scottish sections became British Railways, Scottish Region. The G&SWR; lines retained a distinct informal identity through these changes, and the alliance with the old Midland Railway seemed to survive as well: a day train between Glasgow and St Pancras followed the G&SWR; route and the Midland route; it was named the Thames-Clyde Express for most of its existence, ceasing to run in 1976. A night train with sleeping cars ran from Glasgow over the original route via Paisley and Dalry (to give Paisley a direct service) until the 1970s. Now a secondary route, the line carries local passenger services operated by Abellio ScotRail; a moderate volume of freight also operates over the route. Topography The line opened from Dumfries (temporary station) to Gretna (Junction with the Caledonian Railway) on 23 August 1848. It was extended from Dumfries to Closeburn on 15 October 1849, and completed to Horsecleugh on 20 May 1850. On 20 May 1850 the GD&CR; ceased to exist, forming then part of the Glasgow and South Western Railway.

It lies about 50 kilometres (31 miles) southwest of the provincial capital Stuttgart and about 12 km (7 mi) southwest of the district town T√ºbingen. Rottenburg is the second-largest city of the district after T√ºbingen and makes up a secondary centre for the surrounding community. Since 1 May 1972, Rottenburg am Neckar has been a district town (Gro√üe Kreisstadt). Rottenburg agreed to an administrative collective with the municipalities of Hirrlingen, Neustetten and Starzach. Rottenburg is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, being the official centre of the diocese of Rottenburg- Stuttgart. Moreover, it has a college of church music and a university of applied sciences (German Fachhochschule), specialising in forestry.  Geography  Rottenburg is divided into a city core and seventeen (suburban) districts. Suburban districts of Rottenburg: Bad Niedernau, Baisingen, Bieringen, Dettingen, Eckenweiler, Ergenzingen, Frommenhausen, Hailfingen, Hemmendorf, Kiebingen, Obernau, Oberndorf, Schwalldorf, Seebronn, Weiler, Wendelsheim and Wurmlingen.  History  Rottenburg was founded as a Roman town, Sumelocenna, probably around the year AD98, and was one of the most important Roman towns in the southwest of Germany. It had a line of walls built to defend it from the attacks of the Alamanni, who nevertheless destroyed it in 259-260. The name Rottenburg is thought to derive from a Germanic root that is also present in the English word \\"rotten\\", in an older meaning of \\"destroyed\\". According to this hypothesis, the town would have received its name when, in the early Middle Ages, Alemannic people founded their settlement in the vicinity of the ruins of Roman Sumelocenna. An alternative etymology of Rottenburg as \\"red borough\\" is also considered possible, however. In the Middle Ages, the town was first governed by the counts of Hohenberg, who, however, were forced to sell it to the Habsburg dynasty in 1381. Rottenburg remained a part of Further Austria until 1805, when it was assigned to W√ºrttemberg in the Peace of Pressburg. Rottenburg became the seat of a Catholic bishop as late as 1821‚Äì1828, when, after the secularisation and the Napoleonic Wars, a reorganisation of Catholic life in southwest Germany had become necessary. It was then decided not to choose the more important nearby places of Stuttgart or T√ºbingen as a diocesan town, as these were firmly Protestant. Rottenburg is known among Anabaptists as the place of death for Michael Sattler, a former monk who was involved in missionary activities in the Rottenburg and Horb am Neckar region. Sattler was burned at the stake on \\"Gallows Hill\\" on 20 May 1527.  Main sights Dom St. Martin has been the city's cathedral since 1821. Its tower, dating from 1486, is its most prominent feature. The Four Evangelists (15th century) on the choir ceiling of Stiftskirche St. Moriz. Spanning various architectural periods, the Stiftskirche St. Moriz incorporates a Gothic core with elements from an earlier church and a later Baroque hall church. The Gothic feel is what persists, from 14th- and 15th-century frescoes on the pillars to the 15th-century painting of the Four Evangelists on the ceiling in the choir. In the north aisle stands an ornamented column depicting various princes, donated in 1470 by Archduchess Mechthild, the wife of Ludwig I and mother of Eberhard the Bearded. A copy also stands in the city's Marktplatz. There are two museums in town, the S√ºlchgau Museum, specialising in pre- and early history and Roman influences on the area, and the diocesan museum, focusing on ecclesiastical art, painting and sculpture. In nearby Weggental is the pilgrimage church of Wallfahrtskirche St. Maria, rebuilt in 1682‚Äì1695 in Baroque style, but containing a medieval piet√† and a very fine rendition of the Virgin swooning during the Deposition of Christ from the cross. A more modern landmark is the Eckenweiler Water Tower. Built of reinforced concrete in the 1970s, its unusual design, a cube supported by a rectangular column, is notable.  Sister city  Since 1979 Rottenburg's sister city is Saint Claude in France.

The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions (such as add, move data, and branch) but the single processor can run instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs that support multithreading or other parallel computing techniques. Manufacturers typically integrate the cores onto a single integrated circuit die (known as a chip multiprocessor or CMP) or onto multiple dies in a single chip package. The microprocessors currently used in almost all personal computers are multi-core. A multi-core processor implements multiprocessing in a single physical package. Designers may couple cores in a multi-core device tightly or loosely. For example, cores may or may not share caches, and they may implement message passing or shared-memory inter-core communication methods. Common network topologies used to interconnect cores include bus, ring, two-dimensional mesh, and crossbar. Homogeneous multi-core systems include only identical cores; heterogeneous multi-core systems have cores that are not identical (e.g. big.LITTLE have heterogeneous cores that share the same instruction set, while AMD Accelerated Processing Units have cores that do not share the same instruction set). Just as with single-processor systems, cores in multi-core systems may implement architectures such as VLIW, superscalar, vector, or multithreading. Multi-core processors are widely used across many application domains, including general- purpose, embedded, network, digital signal processing (DSP), and graphics (GPU). Core count goes up to even dozens, and for specialized chips over 10,000, and in supercomputers (i.e. clusters of chips) the count can go over 10 million. The improvement in performance gained by the use of a multi-core processor depends very much on the software algorithms used and their implementation. In particular, possible gains are limited by the fraction of the software that can run in parallel simultaneously on multiple cores; this effect is described by Amdahl's law. In the best case, so-called embarrassingly parallel problems may realize speedup factors near the number of cores, or even more if the problem is split up enough to fit within each core's cache(s), avoiding use of much slower main-system memory. Most applications, however, are not accelerated so much unless programmers invest a prohibitive amount of effort in re-factoring the whole problem. The parallelization of software is a significant ongoing topic of research. Cointegration of multiprocessor applications provides flexibility in network architecture design. Adaptability within parallel models is an additional feature of systems utilizing these protocols. Terminology The terms multi- core and dual-core most commonly refer to some sort of central processing unit (CPU), but are sometimes also applied to digital signal processors (DSP) and system on a chip (SoC). The terms are generally used only to refer to multi- core microprocessors that are manufactured on the same integrated circuit die; separate microprocessor dies in the same package are generally referred to by another name, such as multi-chip module. This article uses the terms \\"multi- core\\" and \\"dual-core\\" for CPUs manufactured on the same integrated circuit, unless otherwise noted. In contrast to multi-core systems, the term multi-CPU refers to multiple physically separate processing-units (which often contain special circuitry to facilitate communication between each other). The terms many-core and massively multi-core are sometimes used to describe multi-core architectures with an especially high number of cores (tens to thousands). Some systems use many soft microprocessor cores placed on a single FPGA. Each \\"core\\" can be considered a \\"semiconductor intellectual property core\\" as well as a CPU core. Development While manufacturing technology improves, reducing the size of individual gates, physical limits of semiconductor-based microelectronics have become a major design concern. These physical limitations can cause significant heat dissipation and data synchronization problems. Various other methods are used to improve CPU performance. Some instruction-level parallelism (ILP) methods such as superscalar pipelining are suitable for many applications, but are inefficient for others that contain difficult-to-predict code. Many applications are better suited to thread-level parallelism (TLP) methods, and multiple independent CPUs are commonly used to increase a system's overall TLP. A combination of increased available space (due to refined manufacturing processes) and the demand for increased TLP led to the development of multi-core CPUs. =Commercial incentives= Several business motives drive the development of multi-core architectures. For decades, it was possible to improve performance of a CPU by shrinking the area of the integrated circuit (IC), which reduced the cost per device on the IC. Alternatively, for the same circuit area, more transistors could be used in the design, which increased functionality, especially for complex instruction set computing (CISC) architectures. Clock rates also increased by orders of magnitude in the decades of the late 20th century, from several megahertz in the 1980s to several gigahertz in the early 2000s. As the rate of clock speed improvements slowed, increased use of parallel computing in the form of multi- core processors has been pursued to improve overall processing performance. Multiple cores were used on the same CPU chip, which could then lead to better sales of CPU chips with two or more cores. For example, Intel has produced a 48-core processor for research in cloud computing; each core has an x86 architecture. =Technical factors= Since computer manufacturers have long implemented symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) designs using discrete CPUs, the issues regarding implementing multi-core processor architecture and supporting it with software are well known. Additionally: * Using a proven processing- core design without architectural changes reduces design risk significantly. * For general-purpose processors, much of the motivation for multi-core processors comes from greatly diminished gains in processor performance from increasing the operating frequency. This is due to three primary factors:Patterson, David A. \\"Future of computer architecture.\\" Berkeley EECS Annual Research Symposium (BEARS), College of Engineering, UC Berkeley, US. 2006. *# The memory wall; the increasing gap between processor and memory speeds. This, in effect, pushes for cache sizes to be larger in order to mask the latency of memory. This helps only to the extent that memory bandwidth is not the bottleneck in performance. *# The ILP wall; the increasing difficulty of finding enough parallelism in a single instruction stream to keep a high- performance single-core processor busy. *# The power wall; the trend of consuming exponentially increasing power (and thus also generating exponentially increasing heat) with each factorial increase of operating frequency. This increase can be mitigated by \\"shrinking\\" the processor by using smaller traces for the same logic. The power wall poses manufacturing, system design and deployment problems that have not been justified in the face of the diminished gains in performance due to the memory wall and ILP wall. In order to continue delivering regular performance improvements for general- purpose processors, manufacturers such as Intel and AMD have turned to multi- core designs, sacrificing lower manufacturing-costs for higher performance in some applications and systems. Multi-core architectures are being developed, but so are the alternatives. An especially strong contender for established markets is the further integration of peripheral functions into the chip. =Advantages= The proximity of multiple CPU cores on the same die allows the cache coherency circuitry to operate at a much higher clock rate than what is possible if the signals have to travel off-chip. Combining equivalent CPUs on a single die significantly improves the performance of cache snoop (alternative: Bus snooping) operations. Put simply, this means that signals between different CPUs travel shorter distances, and therefore those signals degrade less. These higher-quality signals allow more data to be sent in a given time period, since individual signals can be shorter and do not need to be repeated as often. Assuming that the die can physically fit into the package, multi-core CPU designs require much less printed circuit board (PCB) space than do multi-chip SMP designs. Also, a dual-core processor uses slightly less power than two coupled single-core processors, principally because of the decreased power required to drive signals external to the chip. Furthermore, the cores share some circuitry, like the L2 cache and the interface to the front-side bus (FSB). In terms of competing technologies for the available silicon die area, multi-core design can make use of proven CPU core library designs and produce a product with lower risk of design error than devising a new wider-core design. Also, adding more cache suffers from diminishing returns. Multi-core chips also allow higher performance at lower energy. This can be a big factor in mobile devices that operate on batteries. Since each core in a multi-core CPU is generally more energy-efficient, the chip becomes more efficient than having a single large monolithic core. This allows higher performance with less energy. A challenge in this, however, is the additional overhead of writing parallel code. =Disadvantages= Maximizing the usage of the computing resources provided by multi-core processors requires adjustments both to the operating system (OS) support and to existing application software. Also, the ability of multi-core processors to increase application performance depends on the use of multiple threads within applications. Integration of a multi-core chip can lower the chip production yields. They are also more difficult to manage thermally than lower-density single-core designs. Intel has partially countered this first problem by creating its quad-core designs by combining two dual-core ones on a single die with a unified cache, hence any two working dual-core dies can be used, as opposed to producing four cores on a single die and requiring all four to work to produce a quad-core CPU. From an architectural point of view, ultimately, single CPU designs may make better use of the silicon surface area than multiprocessing cores, so a development commitment to this architecture may carry the risk of obsolescence. Finally, raw processing power is not the only constraint on system performance. Two processing cores sharing the same system bus and memory bandwidth limits the real-world performance advantage. In a 2009 report, Dr Jun Ni showed that if a single core is close to being memory-bandwidth limited, then going to dual-core might give 30% to 70% improvement; if memory bandwidth is not a problem, then a 90% improvement can be expected; however, Amdahl's law makes this claim dubious. It would be possible for an application that used two CPUs to end up running faster on a single-core one if communication between the CPUs was the limiting factor, which would count as more than 100% improvement. Hardware =Trends= The trend in processor development has been towards an ever-increasing number of cores, as processors with hundreds or even thousands of cores become theoretically possible. In addition, multi-core chips mixed with simultaneous multithreading, memory-on-chip, and special-purpose \\"heterogeneous\\" (or asymmetric) cores promise further performance and efficiency gains, especially in processing multimedia, recognition and networking applications. For example, a big.LITTLE core includes a high-performance core (called 'big') and a low-power core (called 'LITTLE'). There is also a trend towards improving energy-efficiency by focusing on performance-per-watt with advanced fine-grain or ultra fine-grain power management and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (i.e. laptop computers and portable media players). Chips designed from the outset for a large number of cores (rather than having evolved from single core designs) are sometimes referred to as manycore designs, emphasising qualitative differences. =Architecture= The composition and balance of the cores in multi-core architecture show great variety. Some architectures use one core design repeated consistently (\\"homogeneous\\"), while others use a mixture of different cores, each optimized for a different, \\"heterogeneous\\" role. How multiple cores are implemented and integrated significantly affects both the developer's programming skills and the consumer's expectations of apps and interactivity versus the device. A device advertised as being octa- core will only have independent cores if advertised as True Octa-core, or similar styling, as opposed to being merely two sets of quad-cores each with fixed clock speeds. The article \\"CPU designers debate multi-core future\\" by Rick Merritt, EE Times 2008, includes these comments: Software effects An outdated version of an anti-virus application may create a new thread for a scan process, while its GUI thread waits for commands from the user (e.g. cancel the scan). In such cases, a multi-core architecture is of little benefit for the application itself due to the single thread doing all the heavy lifting and the inability to balance the work evenly across multiple cores. Programming truly multithreaded code often requires complex co- ordination of threads and can easily introduce subtle and difficult-to-find bugs due to the interweaving of processing on data shared between threads (see thread-safety). Consequently, such code is much more difficult to debug than single-threaded code when it breaks. There has been a perceived lack of motivation for writing consumer-level threaded applications because of the relative rarity of consumer-level demand for maximum use of computer hardware. Also, serial tasks like decoding the entropy encoding algorithms used in video codecs are impossible to parallelize because each result generated is used to help create the next result of the entropy decoding algorithm. Given the increasing emphasis on multi-core chip design, stemming from the grave thermal and power consumption problems posed by any further significant increase in processor clock speeds, the extent to which software can be multithreaded to take advantage of these new chips is likely to be the single greatest constraint on computer performance in the future. If developers are unable to design software to fully exploit the resources provided by multiple cores, then they will ultimately reach an insurmountable performance ceiling. The telecommunications market had been one of the first that needed a new design of parallel datapath packet processing because there was a very quick adoption of these multiple-core processors for the datapath and the control plane. These MPUs are going to replace the traditional Network Processors that were based on proprietary microcode or picocode. Parallel programming techniques can benefit from multiple cores directly. Some existing parallel programming models such as Cilk Plus, OpenMP, OpenHMPP, FastFlow, Skandium, MPI, and Erlang can be used on multi-core platforms. Intel introduced a new abstraction for C++ parallelism called TBB. Other research efforts include the Codeplay Sieve System, Cray's Chapel, Sun's Fortress, and IBM's X10. Multi-core processing has also affected the ability of modern computational software development. Developers programming in newer languages might find that their modern languages do not support multi-core functionality. This then requires the use of numerical libraries to access code written in languages like C and Fortran, which perform math computations faster than newer languages like C#. Intel's MKL and AMD's ACML are written in these native languages and take advantage of multi-core processing. Balancing the application workload across processors can be problematic, especially if they have different performance characteristics. There are different conceptual models to deal with the problem, for example using a coordination language and program building blocks (programming libraries or higher-order functions). Each block can have a different native implementation for each processor type. Users simply program using these abstractions and an intelligent compiler chooses the best implementation based on the context. Managing concurrency acquires a central role in developing parallel applications. The basic steps in designing parallel applications are: ; Partitioning : The partitioning stage of a design is intended to expose opportunities for parallel execution. Hence, the focus is on defining a large number of small tasks in order to yield what is termed a fine-grained decomposition of a problem. ; Communication : The tasks generated by a partition are intended to execute concurrently but cannot, in general, execute independently. The computation to be performed in one task will typically require data associated with another task. Data must then be transferred between tasks so as to allow computation to proceed. This information flow is specified in the communication phase of a design. ; Agglomeration : In the third stage, development moves from the abstract toward the concrete. Developers revisit decisions made in the partitioning and communication phases with a view to obtaining an algorithm that will execute efficiently on some class of parallel computer. In particular, developers consider whether it is useful to combine, or agglomerate, tasks identified by the partitioning phase, so as to provide a smaller number of tasks, each of greater size. They also determine whether it is worthwhile to replicate data and computation. ; Mapping : In the fourth and final stage of the design of parallel algorithms, the developers specify where each task is to execute. This mapping problem does not arise on uniprocessors or on shared-memory computers that provide automatic task scheduling. On the other hand, on the server side, multi-core processors are ideal because they allow many users to connect to a site simultaneously and have independent threads of execution. This allows for Web servers and application servers that have much better throughput. =Licensing= Vendors may license some software \\"per processor\\". This can give rise to ambiguity, because a \\"processor\\" may consist either of a single core or of a combination of cores. * Initially, for some of its enterprise software, Microsoft continued to use a per-socket licensing system. However, for some software such as BizTalk Server 2013, SQL Server 2014, and Windows Server 2016, Microsoft has shifted to per-core licensing. * Oracle Corporation counts an AMD X2 or an Intel dual-core CPU as a single processor but uses other metrics for other types, especially for processors with more than two cores. Compare: Embedded applications An embedded system on a plug-in card with processor, memory, power supply, and external interfaces Embedded computing operates in an area of processor technology distinct from that of \\"mainstream\\" PCs. The same technological drives towards multi-core apply here too. Indeed, in many cases the application is a \\"natural\\" fit for multi-core technologies, if the task can easily be partitioned between the different processors. In addition, embedded software is typically developed for a specific hardware release, making issues of software portability, legacy code or supporting independent developers less critical than is the case for PC or enterprise computing. As a result, it is easier for developers to adopt new technologies and as a result there is a greater variety of multi-core processing architectures and suppliers.  Network processors  , multi-core network processors have become mainstream, with companies such as Freescale Semiconductor, Cavium Networks, Wintegra and Broadcom all manufacturing products with eight processors. For the system developer, a key challenge is how to exploit all the cores in these devices to achieve maximum networking performance at the system level, despite the performance limitations inherent in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) operating system. Companies such as 6WIND provide portable packet processing software designed so that the networking data plane runs in a fast path environment outside the operating system of the network device.  Digital signal processing  In digital signal processing the same trend applies: Texas Instruments has the three-core TMS320C6488 and four-core TMS320C5441, Freescale the four-core MSC8144 and six-core MSC8156 (and both have stated they are working on eight-core successors). Newer entries include the Storm-1 family from Stream Processors, Inc with 40 and 80 general purpose ALUs per chip, all programmable in C as a SIMD engine and Picochip with three-hundred processors on a single die, focused on communication applications.  Heterogeneous systems  In heterogeneous computing, where a system uses more than one kind of processor or cores, multi-core solutions are becoming more common: Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC has Quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 and Dual-core ARM Cortex-R5.

A typical example of a DSP- specific implementation would be a combination of a RISC CPU and a DSP MPU. This allows for the design of products that require a general-purpose processor for user interfaces and a DSP for real-time data processing; this type of design is common in mobile phones. In other applications, a growing number of companies have developed multi-core DSPs with very large numbers of processors. # Two types of operating systems are able to use a dual-CPU multiprocessor: partitioned multiprocessing and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP). In a partitioned architecture, each CPU boots into separate segments of physical memory and operate independently; in an SMP OS, processors work in a shared space, executing threads within the OS independently.

It opened in 1963. It is home to the Illinois State University Redbirds football team. History ISU vs. Drake at Hancock Stadium Opened in 1963 and named after Illinois State's former athletic director Dr. Howard Hancock. In 1969, Hancock Stadium became Illinois' first college stadium that featured artificial turf as its playing surface. The artificial turf was replaced most recently in 2010 and a new scoreboard was installed. For many years, Hancock Stadium was the home of the Illinois High School football championships. The games moved in 1999. Renovation In 2000 the Kaufman Football Building was opened. This facility is now the home to the players and coaches. In recent years, Redbird football has enjoyed a resurgence of spirit and success, all bringing attention to the ailing facility. Under the leadership of athletic director (Gary Friedman) and university president (Dr. Al Bowman), plans detailing the Hancock Stadium Stadium renovations were unveiled in 2011. The plans boast upgrades to the design of the new east-side grandstand, bleacher- back seating on the entire new east-side grandstand, wide and spacious concourse, entirely new concession and restroom facilities, premium seating options, including 500+ chairback club seats, 5,500 sq. ft, indoor club accessible to club seat holders and 7 suites, state-of-the-art press level above the indoor club, Redbird Team Store, where fans can purchase ISU gear, a brand new ticket office to improve the fan experience on game days, and a new sound system and scoreboard (if funding allows). Newly renovated Hancock Stadium's capacity is 13,391 The estimated cost of the Hancock Stadium renovation is $20 million. In the summer of 2011, the south bleachers of the stadium were removed to potentially start the first phase of renovations. Also fiberglass bleachers are a thing of the past, as new metal bleachers were installed on the west side of Hancock Stadium in August 2011.http://wjbc.com/tags/hancock-stadium/page/4/ Eye to the Future The design of the new east-side grandstand takes into account possible future growth and expansion.

The island has several nearby islands and the general collection of islands is also called Petrie Island. The islands were formed from clay and sand that was deposited following the end of the last ice age. The area incorporates provincially significant wetlands and wooded areas that provide habitat for plants, animals and birds, especially during spring and fall migration. Extensive flooding occurs during the spring. The size of the islands was reduced when water levels were raised by the hydroelectric dam at Carillon. The island was named after a local landowner Captain Archibald Petrie, an early inhabitant of Cumberland Township. In 1955, Donat Grandma√Ætre purchased the island and set up a sand and gravel extraction facility. The island is now owned by the City of OttawaPark Locations - East, City of Ottawa and incorporates the Grandmaitre Ecological Reserve, the Bill Holland Trail, the Al Tweddle Picnic Area, the Friends of Petrie Island Interpretive Centre, and Stuemer Park.Aerial view of Stuemer ParkBridge Study, City of Ottawa Stuemer Park was named after an Ottawa family who sailed from Petrie Island around the world, returning to Petrie to complete their voyage.\\"At last, they understand what they mean to Ottawa\\" , Ottawa Citizen The Petrie Island Park area is classified as Significant Wetlands by the province of Ontario,Petrie Islands- Wetland, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources which defines it as an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. One of the last relatively natural environments on the Ontario side of the Ottawa River below the nation‚Äôs capital, the archipelago features a Carolinian deciduous swamp forest, possibly the only one in Eastern Canada north of Toronto. Seasonal flooding, extensive sand deposits, abundant water plants and thin but fertile soils have helped maintain a variety of life not found in many other places and its habitats are extremely rich. There are several species of turtles, some rare, and well over 130 species of birds have been identified at Petrie. There are also provincially rare plants, including stands of hackberry trees. There is a network of trails through a nature preserve, and a small interpretive center, both maintained by volunteers.

It opened in 1938 and was home to the Southern Illinois University Salukis football team, as well as the track team. It was replaced by Saluki Stadium in 2010. Originally built by the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression of the mid-1930s, it had a construction cost of $150,000, only seated 5,000 and was hailed as one of the most attractive stadiums in the Midwest. The first game at the stadium took place on October 1, 1938, a 27‚Äì0 loss to Southeast Missouri State. Two weeks later, Southern Illinois University defeated Arkansas State, 6‚Äì0, for its first home win in its new stadium. When William McAndrew, the school's first head coach, died in 1943, the University named the stadium McAndrew Stadium in his honor. The most comprehensive renovation to the stadium took place after the 1973 season, when additional seating was erected on both sides. Southern Illinois has played 328 games at the stadium since it first opened and has a record of 168-154-6. Among the more memorable games include a 16‚Äì13 win over nationally ranked Tulsa on Oct. 28, 1967. In 1983, SIU beat Nevada, 23‚Äì7, to advance to the Division I-AA National Championship game. After the 1996 Atlanta Olympics SIU competed to have the track surface and won, which meant that the Olympic track was dismantled and brought from Atlanta to McAndrew Stadium. After a 29-year absence, night football returned to McAndrew Stadium in 2002. The Salukis opened the season with a 78‚Äì0 win over Kentucky Wesleyan on August 29, followed by a fireworks show. Prior to 2002, the last night game at McAndrew was Oct. 20, 1973, when the Salukis hosted Tampa. The lighting system became inoperable the following year. In 2001, a new AstroPlay turf was installed at a cost of $550,000. With its taller surface, the turf resembles natural grass. It also has a soft rubber base to provide added cushioning. In 2003, the university's board of trustees approved a land use plan that will create a new \\"gateway\\" to SIU that includes a new football stadium. The stadium closed at the end of the 2009 football season, and on December 15, 2010, McAndrew began demolition and was completed in February 2011. The track, however, remained until a new one was constructed by Abe Martin Field. Demolition and removal of the remaining stadium structures began in the spring of 2012. It is now home to a parking lot.

It is located on the south side of 21st Street, east of Hillside, on the campus of Wichita State University in northeast Wichita. Cessna Stadium was the home of the Shocker track and field team until 2020. Before the WSU football program was discontinued, the Shocker football team played home games at this stadium. On April 15, 2020, the Kansas Board of Regents approved a demolition of the stadium. History In the early days of Wichita State University, when it was known as Fairmount College, its first football field was located on the north side of 17th Street, immediately east of the current Henrion Hall, when it was the Henrion Gymnasium. In 1929, concrete bleachers were attached to the east side of the same building for football games.Henrion Hall; Wichita State University. In 1940, the school decided to build a new football stadium on the north side of campus at the current site on the south side of 21st Street. On January 6, 1941, ground was broken for Veterans Field, and by September 1942 the bowl was excavated, foundations were poured for the west stands, and a quarter of the west bleachers were completed; however, construction was halted due to metal shortages during World War II. After the war ended, the bleachers were constructed in sections over time as funds were incrementally available. By mid-1946, stands were completed to a point where 6,000 seats were ready by the start of the 1946 football season. Veterans Field was finally completed before the start of the 1948 football season, with 15,000 seats and facilities for the press, concessions stands, and locker rooms. It was dedicated on November 25, 1948 during a football game with the University of Nevada. The stadium was dedicated to the members of the armed forces from Sedgwick County who served in World War II.Notes from Wichita newspapers about Veterans Field and Cessna Stadium; Dr. Edward N. Tihen; Wichita State University.Wichita State to celebrate Veterans Field on Veterans Day; November 1, 2010; Wichita State University. In 1967, Wichita State started considering the expansion of Veterans Field. In 1968, faculty and students voted and approved the expansion by adding on top of the existing stands of Veterans Field. Cessna Aircraft Company pledged a donation of $300,000 for the proposed stadium, and it was renamed to Cessna Stadium. The cost of the expansion was $1.5 Million, and the school had a fund drive to raise the remaining money. Construction was started on February 7, 1969 and completed in September. It was one of the most modern and complete football facilities in the nation at the time of its completion.Cessna Stadium; Wichita State University. Wichita State University rededicated the facility on April 16, 2002 to mark the end of the seven-month, $1.3 million construction that included adding an eighth lane and resurfacing the track, reconfiguring the infield event layout, and building separate locker rooms for the Shocker men's and women's track and field teams, and a reduction of overall seating capacity. The first event in the renovated facility was WSU's annual K. T. Woodman Track and Field Classic, which is scheduled every April. =Football= The Wichita State Shockers football team was an NCAA Division I football program. The Shockers fielded a team from 1897 to 1986. They played home games at Cessna Stadium and were members of the Missouri Valley Conference when the program was discontinued in 1986. Cessna was the location of a Pittsburg State-Mesa State Division II college football game.

His premier works are Hatcher's Notebook and Book of the Garand, along with Pistols and Revolvers and Their Uses and Textbook of Pistols and Revolvers. In the latter work he introduced the Hatcher Scale, probably the first attempt to determine the stopping power of a handgun round by a formula. He was also a pioneer in the forensic identification of firearms and their ammunition. Hatcher retired from the United States Army as a Major General. Afterward, he served as Technical Editor of the National Rifle Association's American Rifleman magazine. Hatcher was born in Hayfield, Virginia and graduated with honors from Annapolis in 1909 [he voluntarily transferred from the Navy to the Army's coast artillery]. He married Eleanor Dashiell and together, they had three children. Chief of the Small Arms Division in the Ordnance Department and the Assistant Commandant of the Ordnance School before and at the beginning of World War II, he worked closely with Springfield Armory as an engineering trouble-shooter in resolving early production issues associated with the early iterations of the M1 Garand Rifle. In 1916, the Hotchkiss M1909 Ben√©t-Merci√© machine gun was in general use with the U.S. Army and was seeing action during the Punitive Expedition against the bandit Pancho Villa. Reports of its use in Mexico indicated the gun was not functioning properly. Investigation revealed that the chief problems were the 30-round metallic feed strips used in the gun and inexperienced gunners. It was Lieutenant Hatcher who was sent to the border to solve the problems. He found that none of the soldiers had been taught the proper use of the weapon. He set up the Army's first machine gun school and was soon turning out trained crews. Soon, the Ben√©t-Merci√© proved to be an effective weapon. Hatcher was later instrumental in developing a solution to the vexing problem of brittle metal in early M1903 receivers built by Springfield and Rock Island Arsenals. His solution to the \\"grenading\\" of receivers when shell cases failed catastrophically was to drill a gas vent hole in the left side of the receiver adjacent to the breech. This hole would allow gases escaping from a ruptured case to be exhausted safely and away from the face of the shooter. Dubbed the \\"Hatcher Hole\\", the modification was typically added to receivers at overhaul. Books * Julian S. Hatcher, Glenn P. Wilhelm and Harry J.

It launched in November 1998 on the ITV Digital platform, and closed down in March 2003, 5 months after Carlton went off the air in the London region, being the last ever Carlton-branded television network to do so. Its sister channels were Carlton Select, Carlton World, Carlton Kids, and Carlton Food Network. The channel launched on cable in March 2000 as an evening only replacement for Carlton Select. The first film shown on the channel was the 1953 film Genevieve. Closure When the ITV Digital platform ceased broadcasting on 1 May 2002, the channel struggled to keep going. It was removed from NTL's digital channel line-up in September 2002, and Carlton was negotiating with BSkyB to get the channel onto Sky, but no deal was agreed. The closure was announced on 9 December 2002. The channel closed on 31 March 2003. On that night came the last two films on Carlton Cinema: Genevieve, which was the first film broadcast on the channel on the launch night in November 1998, and afterwards the 1981 neo-noir Body Heat. Following the conclusion of the latter, continuity announcer Fiona Goldman made the closing announcement: \\"Well, that was the last film on Carlton Cinema. It's been almost four-and-a-half years since we first went to air and during that time, we've shown over 4,000 films. We hope you've enjoyed watching them as much as we've enjoyed showing them. So, from our director of programmes George McKee, myself Fiona Goldman, and all the team here at Carlton Cinema, it's been a great pleasure and thank you for having been with us. Now, all we have to do is pick up the popcorn and turn off the lights.\\"The End of Carlton Cinema, 31/03/2003 Then they aired a montage of scenes and quotes from all the films they showed, to the tune of Alice Faye's You'll Never Know, which was regularly being shown on the channel during the final two weeks of its transmission. The farewell montage concluded with the last words ever heard on the channel: The final image shown was a movie theatre screen curtain (one of the many icons of movie palaces during the Golden Age of Hollywood) closing, revealing (for the final time) the Carlton Cinema logo with the date of launch (15 November 1998) on the top and the date of closure (31 March 2003) on the bottom. After a final fade to black, the channel's DOG was still seen for the last 15 minutes. The channel's transmitters were finally shut down at midnight.

It was the home of the Scarlets region and Llanelli RFC rugby teams. The stadium was a combination of seating and standing with a total capacity of 10,800. With the Scarlets having moved to Parc y Scarlets, Stradey Park was demolished in 2010 and is to be replaced with housing.  History  The ground originally opened in 1879 for use by Llanelli RFC. In 1887, Stradey Park was chosen to host its first international rugby union match. In the early days of international rugby, all the British countries switched venues on a regular basis to allow supporters the chance to see their team and clubs the opportunity of share gate receipts. Stradey Park was selected as part of the 1887 Home Nations Championship, with the opening home match for Wales being against England. The game was arranged for 8 January and a temporary stand was erected to allow a seating area so the club could charge higher ticket prices; but on the day the English team refused to play on the ground as the pitch was frozen.Godwin (1984), pg 16. The adjacent cricket ground was in better condition, so the match was moved there along with the entire crowd, many members of which were extremely unhappy as they lost their seating area. Four years later, Stradey Park was given another chance to host the national side when they were again selected to host the Home Nations Championship. In the final match, Stradey Park played host to Ireland and again temporary stands were erected, this time on the east and west sides. On this occasion there were no problems and the ground successfully hosted an international match on 7 March 1891. Although no official attendance figures were taken, the South Wales Daily News stated 'an immense concourse of people assembled on the park; in fact it was the largest that had ever been witnessed at a football match in the tin plate town'.Godwin (1984), pg 30. Two years later, Stradey Park was the final venue of the 1893 Home Nations Championship, hosting Wales against Ireland. Wales, under the captaincy of Welsh rugby legend Arthur Gould, beat the Irish team by a single try scored by Gould's brother, Bert Gould. The score not only gave Wales the win but also saw Wales lift the Triple Crown for the very first time in the country's history. The ground has seen many memorable games including the defeats of Australia in 1967 and New Zealand in 1972. Stradey Park has twice hosted games in the Rugby World Cup, featuring Argentina on both occasions, against Australia in 1991 and Samoa in 1999. One rugby league game was held at Stradey Park. This was between Wales and Lebanon in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup on 2 November 2000. Wales won 24‚Äì22. Due to the ground's owners, Llanelli RFU Ltd., having financial difficulties following the game turning professional, Stradey Park was sold to the Welsh Rugby Union in 1997 for ¬£1.25 million. The ground was repurchased by Llanelli RFU Ltd. in 2005. When the Scarlets regional side was formed in 2003, it was decided that they would play the majority of their home fixtures at Stradey Park. Llanelli RFC continued to play their home matches at the ground. The stadium was also host for the Llanelli A.F.C. UEFA Cup games in the 2006/07 season. The last ever game to be played at Stradey Park was played on 24 October 2008, when the Scarlets defeated Bristol 27‚Äì0 in an EDF Energy Cup match, with a crowd of over 10,800 witnessing the event. The emotional occasion featured a procession of former club captains, as well as choirs, traditional songs and a firework display to commemorate the closing of the old stadium.  Future  Stradey Park was sold to developer Taylor Wimpey in February 2008. A new stadium, Parc y Scarlets, was built at Pemberton on the eastern outskirts of Llanelli, financed by Carmarthenshire County Council and cost an estimated ¬£23 million. The funding came partly from the re-development of the Stradey site and also from the sale of a fast-food outlet and hotel on the site of the new stadium. Parc y Scarlets opened on 15 November 2008. Stradey Park Stadium will be demolished and a small garden of remembrance placed on the site to remember the sporting heroes who played there and the fans whose ashes were scattered on the pitch. Residents at Stradey still oppose the high density housing development on the stadium site and the threat to nearby Sandy Lake which may be lost by planned diversion of the Cille River to allow building of these new homes. This has caused some controversy as the ground is built on what has been designated by Carmarthenshire County Council as 'Recreation Land', and this has led many local residents to petition for no houses to be built on this land and instead for Stradey Park to be renovated. The site remained derelict for two years after its final match and was eventually demolished in 2010 to be replaced with housing.  Layout  Diagram of Stadium Layout The ground was divided up into six separate blocks for the purposes of accommodating spectators. Two standing terraces at the far ends of the ground, known as the East Terrace (which has no roof) and was also be referred to as the Town End, or more informally the Tanner Bank, and the West Terrace or for sponsorship reasons the CSA Covered Terrace which as suggested has a roof. The West Terrace was also referred to as the Pwll End. There were two seating blocks, the North and South Stands. Again for sponsorship reasons the North Stand was known as the WRW Stand. In front of both stands were standing areas called the North and South enclosures respectively. There were several bars located around the ground both inside and out. Outside of the ground was located the car park, the ticket office and official Scarlets shop. One unusual feature of the ground was the scarlet saucepans placed atop each goalpost. The utensils are a reference to the past of Llanelli as a major tin plating centre, as well as to the traditional club anthem, \\"Sosban Fach\\" (Welsh for \\"little saucepan\\").

It is a technique which several U.S. states' departments of transportation have successfully used in repairs to address faulting in older jointed plain concrete pavements. The typical approach is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture, and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness.  History  As a vehicle travels on jointed concrete roads the weight of the vehicle passes from one concrete panel to the next. As the vehicle traverses the joints its weight is placed on the edge of the panel, where the panel is least able to withstand the deflection force. This can cause cracks as pavement shears off the edge of the panel. On older highways built in the early-to-mid 20th century, dowel bars (steel rods) were placed across the joints to help transfer the load from one panel to the next. This was discontinued because the dowel bars tended to corrode and required frequent replacement. Stainless steel dowel bars are more resistant to corrosion, but stainless steel is relatively expensive compared to other materials. Instead, for several decades, the cohesion between the panels and the strength of the roadbed was relied upon to collectively distribute the load from one panel to the next, a concept known as aggregate interlock. Over time the joints and roadbed tended to break down under stress, resulting in cracks and displacement of the panels. Most highways in the United States built as part of the Interstate Highway System from the 1950s to the 1980s relied solely upon aggregate interlock and began to show problems in the 1970s and 1980s. In contemporary highway construction since the mid-1990s, dowel bars are once again placed across joints and at intervals along the pavement. Today, dowel bars are coated with epoxy to prevent the corrosion problems seen in earlier installations.  Dowel bar retrofit overview  Slots for the dowel bar retrofit are milled into existing concrete with the modified roto mill head Many states are retrofitting older highways with epoxy-coated dowel bars. The retrofit begins with cutting of six slots (three in each wheel path) across all transverse joints or cracks. The slots are cut with ganged diamond saws that make six cuts in each wheel path. The concrete between the saw cuts is then removed with lightweight jackhammers (heavy-weight jackhammers tend to damage the concrete around the cuts). The epoxy-coated dowel bars are placed in the slots, then the slots are filled with grout and the joints or cracks are filled with waterproof caulk. The final step is to diamond-grind the joint to remove both excess grout and any displacement of the panels. The final step often involves diamond-grinding of the entire road surface to remove any bumps or dips. Without the dowel bar retrofit this grinding would have to be repeated every six to eight years, but it is predicted that the retrofit will greatly increase this interval. Dowel Bar Retrofit has been proven to outlast Asphalt Overlay by at least ten years, and significantly improves ride quality.  Dowel bar retrofit process  For dowel bar retrofit, dowels, bond breaker, expansion caps, dowel bar support chairs, foam core insert, caulking filler, non-shrink concrete backfill material and submittals are needed. The dowels need to be smooth, round, epoxy and made of bond breaker coated steel conforming to requirements. The bond breaker is to be applied on all surfaces of the dowel bar. The expansion caps belong at each end of the dowel bar and the dowel bar support chairs are used to firmly hold the dowels centered in the slots during backfill operations. The foam core insert is used to re- establish the joint or crack, which allows the bar within each side of the slot to expand and contract. The caulking filler is used to prevent backfill material from flowing into the joint or crack. Non-shrink concrete backfill material that is tested as rapid set concrete patching materials is recommended for use on DBR projects. First, make two saw cuts in the pavement to outline the longitudinal sides of each dowel bar slot. Saw to a depth and length that allows the center of the dowel to be placed at mid-depth in the pavement slab. Saw slots parallel to each other and to the centerline of the roadway with a maximum tolerance of 1‚ÅÑ4-inch per 12 inches of dowel bar length. Employ saws equipped with gang mounted diamond blades capable of cutting a minimum of three or four slots simultaneously in each wheel path. Skewed joints or cracks may require slots longer than the length specified in the plans. Pick up and remove water and paste residue from the pavement surface immediately by means of a vacuum attachment on the sawing machine. For smaller projects, a slot sawing machine might not be feasible. Consider allowing the use of walk-behind saws for slot cutting when the project contains less than 100 retrofit bars. Remove existing concrete from the slots followed by the cleaning out of all debris. Use maximum weight 30 pound jackhammers to remove the concrete remaining between the saw cuts. If the concrete removal operations cause damage to the pavement that is to remain, discontinue concrete removal operations and only resume after taking corrective measures. During concrete removal operations, use a small bush hammer as necessary to produce a flat, level surface within the slot so the backfill flows and consolidates under the dowel bars. Complete installation of retrofit dowels, with dowel bars and backfill placed prior to reopening the lane to public traffic. Place silicone at all joints and cracks followed by the dowel bar assemblies in each slot. Following that, place patching material and then consolidate and finish patching material. Finally, diamond grind the pavement surface within 30 working days of dowel bar retrofit placement. IGGADowel retrofit restores pavement load transfer: when combined with diamond grinding, it provides a long-lasting solution to faulted joints and cracks. By James W. Mack, P.E., Concrete Readers Digest, April/May 1995.  Problems  Dowel bar retrofits, if done badly, can cause serious problems. These problems are usually due to poor workmanship and can be avoided by careful following of specifications and close supervision of workers. Use of heavy jackhammers (heavier than 14 kg class) tends to cause cracking of the concrete all around the slots. Lack of caulk or voids in the caulk put in the joints or cracks leads to cracks around the joints. Voids in the grout (especially below the dowel bar) can cause failure of the grout.  Confusion with road surface markings  Typical marks of the completed dowel bar retrofit The completion of the dowel bar retrofit process usually leaves marks on the concrete pavements which consist of short parallel lines in two groups, left and right, inward the traveling lane from the lane markings. Each group has 3 or 4 slots that are parallel to the traffic flows. Each rectangular slot has the width of about and the length of about or more. The backfilled slots may sometime give an impression that the highway pavements have been milled into grooves especially after the wear of patching material caused by studded tires. The visible marks may appear to be a symmetrical pattern of dash marks on the roadway, as if there were an associated meaning to the pattern. When there are many of them along the roadway, motorists on the interstate highways may interpret the grind marks as an unknown form of mechanical markers, such as ground-in strips, or strange road surface markings. In some cases, these marks are confusing for motorists. When roads are under construction and lanes are laterally shifted, such marks may interfere with temporary lane markings. As the marks from the dowel bar retrofit are not intended to be any form of road surface markings, the responsible agencies try to make these marks smooth and hope to make them less visible to the motorists.

The film was adapted by Hugh Williams and Margaret Vyner from the play of the same name which they had written and found success with in London's West End. Plot The Earl and Countess of Rhyall (Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr) are facing financial troubles and are therefore forced to permit guided tours of their stately home. A suave, somewhat obnoxious American oil tycoon, Charles Delacro (Robert Mitchum), barges into the lady of the manor's private quarters, either deliberately or by mistake. He introduces himself, explaining the family name was originally \\"Delacroix\\" but his grandfather tired of Americans pronouncing the \\"X\\" in the name. Delacro's attentions to the Countess turn her head. Rather than behave jealously, the Earl invites the American to come visit, taking their guest fishing as part of a bid to impress the importance of heritage on Delacro. Also visiting is an ex-girlfriend of Lord Rhyall's, the American heiress Hattie Durant (Jean Simmons). A love triangle (or quadrangle) soon develops. Determined to remain civilized at all times, the Earl pretends not to know that his wife has begun having an affair with Delacro at his London hotel, or that her new mink coat is a gift from her lover. He does suggest to Delacro, however, that he feels a compulsion to defend his wife's honor, and therefore challenges the American to a duel. They aim and fire once apiece inside the mansion, where the Earl is wounded in the arm while Delacro is unharmed. It is soon revealed that Sellers, the family butler who loaded the pistols, made sure both men were firing blanks while he, Sellers, an expert shot, wounded the Earl with a weapon of his own. As much as she would like to, Hilary cannot bring herself to leave her loving husband for the new man in her life. Delacro drives off, taking Hattie with him. Cast * Cary Grant as Victor, Earl of Rhyall * Deborah Kerr as Hilary, Countess of Rhyall * Robert Mitchum as Charles Delacro * Jean Simmons as Hattie Durant * Moray Watson as Trevor Sellers, the Butler  Casting  Originally Cary Grant turned down the role of Victor. Afterwards the role was subsequently offered to his friend Rex Harrison and he accepted. However right before production began, Harrison's wife Kay Kendall fell gravely ill and he was forced to leave the production in order to tend to her. Grant, out of respect for cast and crew, and to keep the filming running according to schedule, decided then to finally take the part. It was originally intended by director Stanley Donen that Cary Grant would play the part of Delacro, the American tourist, while Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall were respectively cast as \\"Victor Rhyall\\" and \\"Hattie\\". But Kendall died soon after completing an earlier Donen film, \\"Once More With Feeling\\", and Harrison dropped out of the film because of this. Cary Grant agreed to play Victor instead of Delacro, and both Rock Hudson and Charlton Heston were approached about playing the American character.

Cary Grant's third collaboration with Deborah Kerr. They had previously worked together on Dream Wife (1953) and An Affair to Remember (1957). Moray Watson was the only member of the original stage cast to be retained for the film version. Set design British interior decorator Felix Harbord served as the film's special consultant for settings. Osterley Park was used as the location for the stately home. Reception While the film was a moderate success at the United Kingdom box office, it was a box office bomb in the United States. Despite this, it was reviewed positively by critics and has since developed a following and has been a staple of American cable television. At the time of its release, Jean Simmons's performance as a madcap heiress earned some praise and a Laurel Award nomination.

COL1A1 encodes the major component of type I collagen, the fibrillar collagen found in most connective tissues, including cartilage.  Function  Collagen is a protein that strengthens and supports many tissues in the body, including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin and the white part of the eye (sclera). The COL1A1 gene produces a component of type I collagen, called the pro-alpha1(I) chain. This chain combines with another pro-alpha1(I) chain and also with a pro-alpha2(I) chain (produced by the COL1A2 gene) to make a molecule of type I procollagen. These triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecules must be processed by enzymes outside the cell. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that cross-link to one another in the spaces around cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong mature type I collagen fibers. Collagenous function includes rigidity and elasticity.  Gene  The COL1A1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 between positions 21.3 and 22.1, from base pair 50,183,289 to base pair 50,201,632.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the COL1A1 gene are associated with the following conditions: * Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type In rare cases, specific heterozygous arginine-to-cysteine substitution mutations in COL1A1 that are also associated with vascular fragility and mimic COL3A1-vEDS * Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, arthrochalasia type is caused by mutations in the COL1A1 gene. The mutations in the COL1A1 gene that cause this disorder instruct the cell to leave out a part of the pro-alpha1(I) chain that contains a segment used to attach one molecule to another. When this part of the protein is missing, the structure of type I collagen is compromised. Tissues that are rich in type I collagen, such as the skin, bones, and tendons, are affected by this change. Ehlers-Danlos type IV is most attributed to abnormalities in the reticular fibers (collagen Type III). * Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classical type: In rare cases, a mutation in the COL1A1 gene has been shown to cause the classical type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This mutation substitutes the amino acid cysteine for the amino acid arginine at position 134 in the protein made by the gene. (The mutation can also be written as Arg134Cys.) The altered protein interacts abnormally with other collagen-building proteins, disrupting the structure of type I collagen fibrils and trapping collagen in the cell. Researchers believe that these changes in collagen cause the signs and symptoms of the disorder. Ehlers- Danlos type IV is most attributed to abnormalities in the reticular fibers (collagen Type III). Without the hydroxylation of lysine, by the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase, the final collagen structure cannot form. * Osteogenesis imperfecta, type I: Osteogenesis imperfecta is the most common disorder caused by mutations in this gene. Mutations that inactivate one of the two copies of the COL1A1 gene cause osteogenesis imperfecta type I. The mutated copy of the gene does not produce any pro-alpha1(I) collagen chains. Because only one copy of the gene is directing the cell to make pro-alpha1(I) chains, cells from people with this disorder make only half of the normal amount of type I collagen, which results in bone fragility and other symptoms. * Osteogenesis imperfecta, type II: Many different types of mutations in the COL1A1 gene can cause osteogenesis imperfecta type II. These mutations range from missing pieces of the COL1A1 gene to amino acid substitutions, in which the amino acid glycine is replaced by another amino acid in the protein strand. Sometimes one end of the gene (called the C-terminus) is altered, which interferes with the association of the protein strands. All of these changes prevent the normal production of mature type I collagen, which results in this severe condition, type II osteogenesis imperfecta. * Osteogenesis imperfecta, type III: Mutations in the COL1A1 gene may result in the production of a protein that is missing segments, making it unusable for collagen production. Other mutations cause the amino acid glycine to be replaced by a different amino acid in the pro-alpha1(I) chain, which inhibits the essential interaction between protein chains. Type I collagen production is inhibited by the inability of the altered procollagen strands to associate and form the triple-stranded, ropelike structure of mature collagen. These alterations negatively affect tissues that are rich in type I collagen, such as the skin, bones, teeth, and tendons, leading to the signs and symptoms of type III osteogenesis imperfecta. * Osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV: Several different types of mutations in the COL1A1 gene cause osteogenesis imperfecta type IV. These mutations may involve missing pieces of the COL1A1 gene or changes in base pairs (the building blocks of DNA). These gene alterations result in a protein that is missing segments or has amino acid substitutions; specifically, the amino acid glycine is replaced by another amino acid. All of these changes interfere with the formation of the mature triple-stranded collagen molecule and prevent the production of mature type I collagen, which results in type IV osteogenesis imperfecta. * Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is a condition that makes bones progressively more brittle and prone to fracturing. A particular variation (polymorphism) in the COL1A1 gene appears to increase the risk of developing osteoporosis. A specific variation at Sp1 binding site is shown to be associated with increased risk of low bone mass and vertebral fracture, because of the changes the COL1A1 protein produced from one copy of the gene. Several studies have shown that women with this particular genetic variation at Sp1 site are more likely to have signs of osteoporosis than are women without the variation. * Predisposition to hernias. * Predisposition to degenerative disc disease, and disc herniation.

Yippies were known for using dramatic theatrics in their demonstrations, and they used Pigasus as a way to mock the social status quo. At a rally announcing his candidacy, Pigasus was confiscated by Chicago policemen and several of his Yippie backers were arrested for disorderly conduct.

The pig's name was a double entendre on Pegasus, the winged horse in Greek mythology and the famous saying \\"When pigs fly\\" used when a highly improbable event should occur. Selected for the campaign by group members Dennis Dalrymple, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, candidate Pigasus was purchased from a farmer by folk-singer and fellow Yippie Phil Ochs. His candidacy was announced during the massive protests leading up to and during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The Yippies demanded that Pigasus be treated as a legitimate candidate, with U.S. Secret Service protection and White House foreign policy briefings. One reason why the Yippies preferred Pigasus was that \\"if we can't have him in the White House, we can have him for breakfast.\\" Press conference and arrests The nomination of Pigasus for president occurred on the morning of August 23, 1968, at the Chicago Civic Center (subsequently renamed as the Richard J.

At the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial, defense counsel William Kunstler accused the Democratic Party of doing exactly the same thing.The Wonderful Pig of Knowledge!: Pigasus and the Yippies The trial of the Yippies was covered by CBS, NBC, ABC, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Sun Times, the AP and UPI wire services, and many other major U.S. news outlets.

Biography Larson was originally from a fundamentalist Christian Evangelical background but \\"rejected its dogmas and practices\\" when he was about twenty years old. Following service in the United States Navy, he graduated from Kalamazoo College in Michigan, after which he earned a Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Michigan in 1927 with a thesis on the unorthodoxies of Milton, whom he found to have rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. He retired from a career in business at the age of 50 to devote himself to private study, lecturing and writing. Larson's lifelong body of work constructs a complete historical theory of the origins of Christianity and the genesis of its theological controversies, detailing its evolution from the pagan cults of Osiris and Dionysus to modern times. This includes a synthesis of ideas, deities, and personalities that show how they combined to favor the rise and dominance of Christianity over religious competitors such as Mithraism, which lacked a human founder and excluded the general public, and Manichaeism, which invited the general public but lacked a deified founder. The thrust of his work is to show that Christianity evolved from pagan religions and Judaism rather than arose full-blown from the mind of a single religious prophet. Although he had no advanced degree in the subject, his works were popular with Freethinkers, and he defended his theories to his death. A longtime friend of historian Harry Elmer Barnes, Larson was a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee of the Institute for Historical Review's Journal of Historical Review from its first issue in 1980 to his death. Larson was also a tax critic and tax expert who was popular with the Tax protester movement for his books on the tax immunity of organized religion, the Federal Reserve, and how to fight the IRS. His articles have appeared in Parade Magazine, Fortune Magazine, Reader's Digest and other publications, and he had a regular column in The Spotlight entitled \\"Our World In Conflict\\".

He died on October 8, 1970 at Dongtan Beach, Jomtien, Pattaya, after falling from a helicopter during the filming of a stunt for the final scene of Insee thong (Golden Eagle). At the height of his career in the 1960s, Mitr, along with Petchara Chaowarat, made a string of hit films that packed cinemas. Of the 75 to 100 films produced each year by the Thai film industry during this period, Mitr starred in nearly half of them. Early life Mitr was born into poverty as Pichet Pumhem. His parents separated when he was an infant. At age 8, Mitr moved to Bangkok, where he was enrolled in a Thai boxing school. He became the lightweight boxing champion for his school in 1949 and 1951, and went on to win three lightweight division titles. After finishing secondary school, he studied at Pranakhon College. He was then accepted into the Royal Thai Air Force aviation school, where he was trained as a pilot. After graduation, he worked as a flight instructor at Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base. In 1956 some friends showed his photograph to journalist Kingkaew Kaewprasert, who introduced him to Surat Pukkawet, the editor of a movie magazine. Before long Mitra starred in his first film, Chart Sua (Tiger Instinct). It was then he decided to change his name from Pichet Pumhem to Mitr Chaibancha. He caught the attention of movie fans after starring in Chao Nakleng (Gangster Lord), using the character name Rom Ritthikrai from author Sake Dusit's Insee Daeng (Red Eagle) series of novels. He married his wife, Jaruwan, in 1959. In 1961 a son, Yuthana, or Ton, was born. However, the marriage ended in a divorce. Height of fame In 1961 Mitr starred in Banthuk Rak Pimchawee (Love Diary of Pimchawee), his first film with Petchara Chaowarat. This was the beginning of the most celebrated hero-heroine partnerships in Thai cinematic history. The Mitr-Petchara duo made about 165 films together. One of the pair's most famous films was 1970's Monrak luk thung (, or Magical Love of the Countryside), a musical romantic comedy rhapsodizing Thai rural life. Mitr was an extremely busy actor and was always on the move, going from set to set and sleeping as little as a two or three hours per night. Another of his best- known movies, Pet Tad Pet (Operation Bangkok), was shot in both Bangkok and Hong Kong, and featured Kecha Plianvitheee and Luecha Naruenart as the villains, as well as Hong Kong's then top actress, Regina Piping. Monrak luk thung was one of Mitr's last films. It played in Bangkok cinemas for a solid six months in 1970 and took in 6 million baht,Mitr Chaibancha its popularity spurred by the best-selling soundtrack album and Mitr's accidental death while filming Insee Thong. His last film Insee thong was the first film that Mitr produced himself, and it featured the return of his popular character, the masked crime-fighter, Insee Daeng (Red Eagle), the secret alter ego of alcoholic detective Rom Rittikrai. On the last day of shooting, the script called for Mitr, having vanquished the villains, to fly off into the sunset in a helicopter. As the camera rolled, Mitr leapt from the ground to grab a rope ladder hanging from the aircraft, only managing to reach the lowest rung. Unaware of this, the helicopter pilot flew higher and higher, and Mitr finally lost his grip and fell to the ground. The accident was all caught on film and was actually left in the final theatrical release. The fatal fall has since been removed from DVD versions of the film, with Mitr simply flying off into the distance and some onscreen text paying tribute to the star. It was another death that would make 1970 a difficult year for the Thai film industry, as months earlier pioneering director Rattana Pestonji collapsed while giving a speech urging government officials to support the domestic film industry. He died several hours later. Mitr‚Äôs death was ruled as a tragic accident. For safety, there should have been two takes for the final scene. The first would have been of Mitr grabbing the ladder and flying off at low altitude. Then, a stunt double would have performed a second shot at a higher altitude. Funeral and memorial shrine The statue of Mitr Chaibancha in a shrine in Jomtien Beach, Thailand. On the day of his funeral, the streets leading to the Buddhist temple were packed, with tens of thousands trying to attend his cremation rites. On the DVD of Insee thong, release in 2005 in Thailand, one of the special features is footage of the cremation ceremony. Mitr's body is held up so the throngs of onlookers could catch a last glimpse of the dead star. He was survived by his former wife and one son. A memorial shrine to Mitr is situated on a small street in Jomtien, off Jomtien Road in front of the Amphoe Bang Lamung Revenue Department, behind Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel. The shrine is open from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily. Inside the spirit house is a statue of Mitr holding a pistol in his right hand, reminiscent of his numerous roles as an action movie star. The walls are lined with photographs and other memorabilia. Fortune seekers visit the shrine, shake Kau Cim sticks and then check for the corresponding fortune on tablets hung on the shrine. If wishes have been granted, fortune seekers return and purchase a small offering to leave at the shrine.

A Confederate sympathizer and a writer of plays, essays, and novels, Gayarr√© is chiefly remembered for his histories of Louisiana.Appleton's Cyclopedia vol.III p.619 Early and family life The grandson of √âtienne de Bor√©, New Orlean's first mayor who introduced cultivation of indigo and sugarcane to the area, Charles Gayarr√© was born at the Bor√© plantation, which was then outside the city limits of New Orleans. (It has long been incorporated into the city as Audubon Park.) His paternal grandfather, Don Esteban de Gayarre, arrived in the area with Spanish Governor Antonio de Ulloa after France ceded it to Spain, and had been comptroller of the province of Louisiana. His other maternal grandfather was the former colonial treasurer under the French and master of Destrehan Plantation, which was involved in a suppressed slave revolt when Charles was a boy. After studying at the College d'Orl√©ans Gayarr√© began in 1826 legal studies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On January 28, 1856, Gayarr√© married Sarah Anne (Shadie) Sullivan (1820-1914) in Lowndes County, Mississippi. In the 1860 census, he owned about a dozen slaves.1860 U.S. Federal Census, slave schedules for St. Helena, Louisiana show Charles Gayarre as owning six slaves, and the same census results for New Orleans Ward 5 show him owning seven slaves, of whom five were children. Career In 1825, Gayarr√© published a pamphlet criticizing changes that Edward Livingston proposed in the Louisiana Criminal Code, particularly with respect to capital punishment (the fate of nearly 100 recaptured slaves during the 1811 German Coast revolt when he was a child).Appleton's cyclopedia He then traveled to Philadelphia for his legal studies, and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1829. In 1830 upon returning to New Orleans, Gayarr√© was elected a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, and the leadership asked him to draft an address complimenting the French legislators during the Revolution of 1830. In 1831, after admission to the Louisiana bar, Gayarr√© became his state's Deputy Attorney General. In 1833 he became presiding judge of the city court of New Orleans. In 1834 he was elected as a Jackson Democrat to the United States Senate. However, he resigned citing health reasons before taking his seat. For the next eight years, Gayarr√© traveled in Europe and collected historical material from France and Spain. Some of the historical documents that he used were written by his ancestor, Esteban de Gayarr√©, In 1844-1845 and in 1856-1857 he was elected again as a Democratic Party member of the state House of Representatives, and from 1845 to 1853 was appointed as Secretary of State of Louisiana. In 1853 he failed to win election to the U.S. Congress as an Independent, but remained active in Louisiana politics as an ally of John Slidell in the \\"Regular Democratic\\" movement. Gayarre lost his fortune of $400,000 by supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War. In 1863 Gayarr√© proposed that slaves be emancipated and armed, provided that France and England recognized the Confederacy (no foreign country recognized it). After the war, Gayarr√© published his 3-volume History of Louisiana (with an introduction by George Bancroft) and a biography of Philip II of Spain, but was never elected to any office. He became a reporter of decisions for the Louisiana Supreme Court, but he lived chiefly by his pen. He had a long- standing association with the Louisiana Historical Society, of which he was unpaid President from 1860 to 1888,http://louisianahistoricalsociety.org/about-the-louisiana-historical- society/lhs-presidents/ thus working with former Confederate President Jefferson Davis after his release from federal custody. Gayarr√© wrote Histoire de la Louisiane (1847); Romance of the History of Louisiana (1848); Louisiana: its Colonial History and Romance (1851), reprinted in A History of Louisiana; History of Louisiana: the Spanish Domination (1854); Philip II of Spain (1866); and A History of Louisiana (4 vols., 1866), the last collecting and adding to his earlier works in this field. The whole covered the history of Louisiana from its earliest discovery by Europeans to 1861. He wrote also several dramas and romances, the best of the latter being Fernando de Lemos (1872).

Her book, Ginger Pye, which she also created illustrations for, won the Newbery Medal. Three of her books were Newbery Honor Winners, and one was awarded the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award. Estes' books were based on her life in small town Connecticut in the early 1900s. Life Born Eleanor Ruth Rosenfield in West Haven, Connecticut, Estes was the third child. Her father, Louis Rosenfeld, was a bookkeeper for a railway; her mother, Caroline Gewecke Rosenfeld, was a seamstress and story teller. Her father died when Estes was young, and her mother's dressmaking provided for the family. Eleanor Estes attributes her love of reading, children's literature, and storytelling to her parent's fondness for books, and her mother's \\"inexhaustible supply of songs, stories, and anecdotes, with which she entertained us with while cooking dinner.\\" In 1923, after graduating from West Haven High School, she trained at the New Haven Free Library, and became a children's librarian there.Cech, John (editor), American Writers for Children, 1900‚Äì1960, Gale Research, 1983 In 1931 Estes won the Caroline M. Hewins scholarship for children's librarians, which allowed her to study at the Pratt Institute library school in New York.\\"Eleanor Estes Papers\\", University of Minnesota library In 1932 she married fellow student Rice Estes. They both worked as librarians throughout New York, and he later became a professor of library science and the head of the Pratt Institute Library.\\"ELEANOR ESTES PAPERS\\", University of Southern Mississippi library Estes worked as a children's librarian in various branches of the New York Public Library, until 1941. Estes began writing when tuberculosis left her confined to her bed. Her best known fictional characters, the Moffats, live in Cranbury, Connecticut, which is Estes‚Äô hometown of West Haven. She based the Moffats after her family, including patterning younger daughter Janey after herself, and basing Rufus on her brother, Teddy. Eleanor based the story The Hundred Dresses on her real life experience as the girl who (unbeknownst to Peggy) received Peggy's hand-me- down dresses. She felt so guilty for not having defended the Wanda Petronski character in real life, that she wrote the story as both an exercise to assuage her guilt, and to encourage others to stand up against bullies.Estes, Helena (daughter), \\"A letter to readers,\\" in The Hundred Dresses, Harcourt Inc., New York, NY 2004. The Esteses had one child, Helena, born in Los Angeles in 1948, where Rice Estes was assistant librarian at the University of Southern California. In 1952 they moved back to the East coast, where she lived until her death. Besides writing and working as a librarian, Estes also taught at the University of New Hampshire Writer's Conference.Newbery Medal Books: 1922‚Äì1955, eds.

Wakselman, \\"Di-t-butyl Dicarbonate\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. . Since this compound can be regarded formally as the acid anhydride derived from a tert- butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, it is commonly referred to as Boc anhydride. This pyrocarbonate reacts with amines to give N-tert-butoxycarbonyl or so-called Boc derivatives. These carbamate derivatives do not behave as amines, which allows certain subsequent transformations to occur that would be incompatible with the amine functional group. The Boc group can later be removed from the amine using moderately strong acids (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid). Thus, Boc serves as a protective group, for instance in solid phase peptide synthesis. Boc-protected amines are unreactive to most bases and nucleophiles, allowing for the use of the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc) as an orthogonal protecting group. Preparation Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate is inexpensive, so it is usually purchased. Classically, this compound is prepared from tert- butanol, carbon dioxide, and phosgene, using DABCO as a base: 400px This route is currently employed commercially by manufacturers in China and India. European and Japanese companies use the reaction of sodium tert-butoxide with carbon dioxide, catalysed by p-toluenesulfonic acid or methanesulfonic acid. This process involves a distillation of the crude material yielding a very pure grade. Boc anhydride is also available as a 70% solution in toluene or THF. As boc anhydride may melt at ambient temperatures, its storage and handling is sometimes simplified by using a solution. Protection and deprotection of amines The Boc group can be added to the amine under aqueous conditions using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate. Protection of the amine can also be accomplished in acetonitrile solution using 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the base. Removal of the Boc in amino acids can be accomplished with strong acids such as trifluoroacetic acid neat or in dichloromethane or with HCl in methanol. A complication may be the tendency of the t-butyl cation intermediate to alkylate other nucleophiles; scavengers such as anisole or thioanisole may be used. Selective cleavage of the N-Boc group in the presence of other protecting groups is possible when using AlCl3. Reaction with trimethylsilyl iodide in acetonitrile followed by methanol is a mild and versatile method of deprotecting Boc-protected amines. The use of triethylsilane as a carbocation scavenger in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane has been shown to lead to increased yields, decreased reaction times, simple work-up and improved selectivity for the deprotection of t-butyl ester and t-butoxycarbonyl sites in protected amino-acids and peptides in the presence of other acid-sensitive protecting groups such as the benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, O- and S-benzyl and t-butylthio groups. Other uses The synthesis of 6-acetyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine, an important bread aroma compound, starting from 2-piperidone was accomplished using t-boc anhydride. (See Maillard reaction). The first step in this reaction sequence is the formation of the carbamate from the reaction of the amide nitrogen with boc anhydride in acetonitrile using DMAP as a catalyst. :Schematic: synthesis of 6-acetyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate also finds applications as a polymer blowing agent due to its decomposition into gaseous products upon heating.  Hazards  Bottles of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate buildup of internal pressure in sealed containers caused by its slow decomposition to di-tert-butyl carbonate and ultimately tert-butanol and CO2 in the presence of moisture. For this reason, it is usually sold and stored in plastic bottles rather than glass ones. The main hazard of the reagent is its inhalational toxicity. Its median lethal concentration of 100 mg/m3 over 4 hours in rats is comparable to that of phosgene (49 mg/m3 over 50 min in rats).

The aim of the Act was to close an anomaly in employment law in the United Kingdom, whereby shopworkers in England and Wales had the legal right to refuse to work on a Sunday, when shopworkers in Scotland did not enjoy this right. The anomaly arose from the different legislation in force in Scotland and the rest of the UK regarding Sunday trading. In Scotland, there was never any legislation preventing Sunday trading, and shops could choose their own opening hours. However, Sunday trading was illegal in England and Wales under the Shops Act 1950. In practice, Scottish shops did not usually open on a Sunday as a matter of custom. Towards the end of the 20th century, demand for Sunday trading increased, and many Scottish shops began to open on a Sunday. An Act of Parliament, the Sunday Trading Act 1994 was passed to allow shops to trade on a Sunday in England and Wales, subject to certain conditions. The 1994 Act also gave shopworkers in England and Wales the right to refuse to work on a Sunday (unless their contract was for work solely on a Sunday). However, as the Act did not extend to Scotland, the same rights were not enjoyed by Scottish shopworkers. Despite the differences most retailers did not force Sunday working on staff in Scotland and, generally, they were treated the same as staff in the rest of the UK, particularly the Scottish staff of UK wide chains. However, in 2001, the retail chain, Argos sparked fury in Scotland when they sacked several Scottish employees for refusing to work on a Sunday. Although they later backed down, several Scottish MPs raised questions on the different legal rights between the different parts of the UK, and demanded that the right to refuse to work on a Sunday be enjoyed by workers in Scotland also. Thus, a Private Member's Bill was laid before Parliament by Malcolm Savidge, MP for Aberdeen North.

Legal context Baronies were created after the Norman invasion of Ireland as divisions of counties and were used in the administration of justice and the raising of revenue. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions.

By the late 1930s, the publisher was Thurman T. Scott. Its comics division was best known for its pinup-style good girl art, as epitomized by the company's most popular character, Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.  Leadership and location  The company's original location was 461 Eighth Avenue in New York City. At the end of 1929, a New York Times article referred to John B. Kelly as \\"head\\" of Fiction House, Inc., and a new location of 271 Madison Avenue. In late 1932, John W. Glenister was president of Fiction House and his son-in-law, Thurman T. Scott, was secretary of the corporation. By the end of the 1930s Scott had risen to the title of publisher. In January 1950, the Manhattan-based company signed a lease for office space at 130 W. 42nd Street. History =Pulp fiction= Fiction House began in 1921 as a pulp-magazine publisher of primarily aviation, Western, and sports pulps. According to co-founder John W. Glenister: During their first decade the company produced pulp magazines such as Action Stories, Air Stories, Lariat Stories, Detective Classics, The Frontier, True Adventures, Wings, and Fight Stories. Fiction House occasionally acquired other publishers' magazines, such as its 1929 acquisition of Frontier Stories from Doubleday, Doran & Co. By the 1930s, the company had expanded into detective mysteries. In late 1932, however, in the midst of the Great Depression, Fiction House cancelled 12 of its pulp magazines -- Aces, Action Novels, Action Stories, Air Stories, Detective Book Magazine, Detective Classics, Fight Stories, Frontier Stories, Lariat, Love Romances, North-West Stories and Wings -- with the stated goal of eventually reviving them. After a hiatus, Action Stories resumed publishing through this period (lasting until late 1950). In addition, Fiction House relaunched its pulp magazines in 1934, finding success with a number of detective and romance pulp titles. The cancelled pulps Fight Stories and Detective Book Magazine were revived in spring 1936 and in 1937 respectively, with both magazines publishing continuously into the 1950s. Fiction House's first title with science fiction interest was Jungle Stories, which was launched in early 1939; it was not primarily a science fiction magazine, but often featured storylines with marginally science fictional themes, such as survivors from Atlantis. At the end of 1939 Fiction House decided to add an sf magazine to its line up; it was titled Planet Stories, and was published by Love Romances, a subsidiary company that Fiction House created to publish the company's romance titles. =Comic books= Jumbo Comics #1 (Sept 1938). Cover artist(s) unknown. By the late 1930s, publisher Thurman T. Scott expanded Fiction House into comic books, an emerging medium that began to seem a viable adjunct to the fading pulps. Receptive to a sales call by Eisner & Iger, one of the prominent \\"packagers\\" of that time which produced complete comic books on demand for publishers looking to enter the field, Scott published Jumbo Comics #1 (Sept. 1938) under the company's Real Adventures Publishing Company imprint.Real Adventures Publishing Co., Inc., Grand Comics Database.

Archived from the original November 10, 2011 Other features in Jumbo Comics #1 included three by future industry legend Jack Kirby, representing his first comic-book work following his debut in Wild Boy Magazine:Per Kirby's recollection in interview, The Nostalgia Journal #30 (Nov. 1976), reprinted in The Comics Journal Library, Volume One: Jack Kirby (2002) , p. 3 the science fiction feature The Diary of Dr. Hayward (under the pseudonym \\"Curt Davis\\"), the modern-West crimefighter strip Wilton of the West (as \\"Fred Sande\\"), and Part One of the swashbuckling serialization of Alexandre Dumas, p√®re's The Count of Monte Cristo (as \\"Jack Curtiss\\"), each four pages long. Jumbo proved a hit, and Fiction House would go on to publish Jungle Comics; the aviation-themed Wings Comics; the science fiction title Planet Comics; Rangers Comics; and Fight Comics during the early 1940s ‚Äî most of these series taking their titles and themes from the Fiction House pulps. Fiction House referred to these titles in its regular house ads as \\"The Big Six,\\" but the company also published several other titles, among them the Western-themed Indians and Firehair, jungle titles Sheena, Queen of the Jungle and Wambi, and five issues of Eisner's The Spirit.

Aside from the ostensible effects of gory horror in comic books, Wertham cast blame on the sexy, pneumatic heroines of Fiction House, Fox Comics and other companies. A subsequent, wide-ranging investigation by the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, coupled with outcry by parents, a downturn in comics sales, the demise of the pulps, and the rise of television and paperback novels competing for readers and leisure time, Fiction House faced an increasingly difficult business environment, and soon closed shop.

The firm had been founded in 1922 by noted Scottish civil engineer, Brigadier-General Sir Alexander Gibb. For the first ten years the business was not very rewarding financially although it was engaged on several important projects. Gibb and his colleague, noted electrical engineer Charles Hesterman Merz, designed Barking Power Station and later the Galloway Hydro Electric development, the first major work of its kind to be linked to the National Grid. Gibb resolved to make his firm the largest of its kind in the country and in time, the firm grew to the point where it was responsible for projects in several parts of the world. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, the firm was organised as a number of specialised departments in Reading, namely Water and Energy (WAE), Transportation and Marine (TAM), Structures and Services (SAS), Project Management Services (PMS) and Gibb Architects. Outside of the United Kingdom, the firm had associated practices including Gibb Africa (headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya), Gibb Botswana (operating from Gaborone)Business Directory page Gibb Petermuller (Headquartered in Athens) and Gibb Mauritius. In 1989, the firm merged with the larger American company, Law, which then sold Gibb to the US-based Jacobs Engineering Group in 2001. Operations Allied Bakeries, St Pauls Cray, London and its art deco inspired tower. During the 1930s, under the direction of Hugh Beaver, the firm brought together architecture and mechanical services with the founding focus on heavy civil engineering, and so was able to offer to industrial clients a complete service. In 1939 Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners designed three large ordnance factories for the Ministry of Supply; three other smaller factories followed later. Other notable designs were the Kincardine Bridge,Juliet Barnes Guinness and Company's brewery at Park Royal, the Captain Cook graving dock at Sydney, Australia, the Singapore naval base, supervision of construction of Phoenix units for the Mulberry harbours and an underground factory for aeroplane engines at Corsham. Between 1930 and 1936, the firm designed the modernist power stations of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. In 1936, it designed the Kincardine Bridge across the Firth of Forth, then Britain's largest road bridge. In 1937, the firm designed the Capper Pass and Son Smelting Works (as well as a row of houses) in Hull. In 1939, it designed the new Allied Bakeries building, in St Pauls Cray (near Orpington). Originally the Tip Top Bakery in Cray Avenue, now part of the Allied Bakeries division of Associated British Foods. During World War II,the Drakelow Tunnels near Kidderminster were designed and constructed. In 1949, Cliff Quay Power Station in Suffolk was designed. In 1968, Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners was joint consulting engineer on the Cleddau Bridge in Wales. Other later works included the Tripoli International Airport (1978), Devonport Dockyard, Limehouse Link tunnel (1989-1993), Great Man-Made River Project in Libya and several defence and airport projects in the Middle East. In the UK, the firm also worked on Waterloo International Railway Terminal between 1988-1993, with Grimshaw Architects and Bovis Construction (as the main contractors), Brook House in Park Lane in London (with Squire and Partners),Details of the Brook House project Reading Crown Courts and HMP Banstead, Surrey. The firm also undertook a number of important hydro-electric dam projects including the design and supervision of Tongariro Hydroelectric Scheme, (New Zealand), Lar Dam (Iran), Victoria Dam (Sri Lanka) (1975-1985), the Samanalawewa Dam project, (Sri Lanka) (1993), Maentwrog New Dam, WalesConstruction of Maentwrog New Dam Book (1928) and Owen Falls Dam (1954), Uganda. Problems emerged on the Samanalawewa project and two years after its completion, its reservoir still could not be filled because its base was leaking. One Sri Lankan geologist has warned: \\"Samanalawewa is a write off\\". Also, the Victoria Dam in Sri Lanka has not produced the amount of energy envisaged by the designed. In 1997, remedial works were carried out on Owen Falls dam under supervision by the consulting firm. In June 1994, GibbAnglian, a partnership created by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners and Anglian Water International, won a two-year contract from the United Kingdom Government'sOverseas Development Administration to study the impact of industrial effluent in the city of Tianjin in China. The partnership's task was to investigate the technical, institutional, environmental, and financial issues involved in reducing industrial wastewater production and improving the quality of effluent discharges.

They are known as 'Western Gangas' to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas who in later centuries ruled over Kalinga (modern Odisha). The general belief is that the Western Gangas began their rule during a time when multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the Pallava empire in South India, a geo-political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of Samudra Gupta. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruling from Kolar and later, moving their capital to Talakadu on the banks of the Kaveri River in modern Mysore district. After the rise of the imperial Chalukyas of Badami, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the Pallavas of Kanchi. The Chalukyas were replaced by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in 753 CE as the dominant power in the Deccan. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the Chola Dynasty of Tanjavur. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region. Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage toward Jainism resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana of 978 CE, is an important work in Kannada prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from religion to elephant management. History Multiple theories have been proposed regarding the ancestry of the founders of the Western Ganga dynasty (prior to the 4th century). Some mythical accounts point to a northern origin,(Rice in Adiga 2006, p88) while theories based on epigraphy suggest a southern origin. According to some records, the Western Gangas were of the Kanvayana gotra and traced their lineage to the Ikshvakus of the solar dynasty. Historians who propose the southern origin have further debated whether the early petty chieftains of the clan (prior to their rise to power) were natives of the southern districts of modern Karnataka,Adiga and Sheik Ali in Adiga (2006), p89Sarma (1992), pp1‚Äì3Ramesh (1984), pp1‚Äì2 the Kongu Nadu region in modern Tamil NaduBaji and Arokiaswamy in Adiga (2006), p89 or of the southern districts of modern Andhra Pradesh.Kamath (2001), p39Krishna Rao in Adiga (2006), p88 These regions encompass an area of the southern Deccan where the three modern states merge geographically. It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage of the confusion caused by the invasion of southern India by the northern king Samudra Gupta prior to 350, and carved out a kingdom for themselves. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi and included regions of the modern districts of Mysore, Hassan Chamarajanagar, Tumkur, Kolar, Mandya and Bangalore in Karnataka state.Kamath (2001), pp39‚Äì40 At times, they also controlled some areas in modern Tamil Nadu (Kongu region starting from the 6th century rule of King Avinita) and Andhra Pradesh (Ananthpur region starting from the middle of the 5th century). The founding king of the dynasty was Konganivarma Madhava who made Kolar his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years. By the time of Harivarma in 390, the Gangas had consolidated their kingdom with Talakad as their capital. Their move from the early capital Kolar may have been a strategic one with the intention of containing the growing Kadamba power.Sarma (1992), p4 By 430 they had consolidated their eastern territories comprising modern Bangalore, Kolar and Tumkur districts and by 470 they had gained control over Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu, Sendraka (modern Chikkamagaluru and Belur), Punnata and Pannada regions (comprising modern Heggadadevanakote and Nanjangud) in modern Karnataka.Adiga 2006, p97, p100From the Cakra-Kedara grant, Kodunjeruvu grant (Adiga 2006, p99 In 529, King Durvinita ascended the throne after waging a war with his younger brother who was favoured by his father, King Avinita.Kamath (2001), p40 Some accounts suggest that in this power struggle, the Pallavas of Kanchi supported Avinita's choice of heir and the Badami Chalukya King Vijayaditya supported his father-in-law, Durvinita.Sheik Ali and Ramesh in Adiga (2006), p100‚Äì101 From the inscriptions it is known that these battles were fought in Tondaimandalam and Kongu regions (northern Tamil Nadu) prompting historians to suggest that Durvinita fought the Pallavas successfully.Adiga (2006), p101 Considered the most successful of the Ganga kings, Durvinita was well versed in arts such as music, dance, ayurveda and taming wild elephants. Some inscriptions sing paeans to him by comparing him to Yudhishthira and Manu ‚Äì figures from Hindu mythology known for their wisdom and fairness.from the Nallala grant (Kamath 2001, p41)Adiga (2006), p109 Politically, the Gangas were feudatories and close allies who also shared matrimonial relations with the Chalukyas. This is attested by inscriptions which describe their joint campaigns against their arch enemy, the Pallavas of Kanchi.From the Aihole inscriptions and the Jangamarahalli inscription (Adiga 2006, 102) From the year 725 onwards, the Gangavadi territories came to be called as the \\"Gangavadi-96000\\" (Shannavati Sahasra Vishaya) comprising the eastern and western provinces of modern south Karnataka.(Adiga 2006, p103) King Sripurusha fought the Pallava King Nandivarman Pallavamalla successfully, bringing Penkulikottai in north Arcot under his control temporarily for which he earned the title Permanadi.From the Shimoga records (N.L. Rao in Kamath 2001, p41)The title was given to a later Ganga King Rachamalla I (Ramesh in Adiga p115), the Agali grant and Devarahalli inscription calls Sripurusha Maharajadhiraja Paramamahesvara Bhatara (Adiga 2006, pp115‚Äì116) A contest with the Pandyas of Madurai over control of Kongu region ended in a Ganga defeat, but a matrimony between a Ganga princess and Rajasimha Pandya's son brought peace helping the Gangas retain control over the contested region.Sastri in Adiga 2006, p115From Salem plates of Sripurusha dated 771 and the Koramangala grant (Ramesh in Adiga 2006, p116) In 753, when the Rashtrakutas replaced the Badami Chalukyas as the dominant force in the Deccan, the Gangas offered stiff resistance for about a century.Kamath (2001), p42From several Tumkur inscriptions (Adiga 2006, p117) King Shivamara II is mostly known for his wars with the Rashtrakuta Dhruva Dharavarsha, his subsequent defeat and imprisonment, his release from prison and eventually his death on the battle field. The Ganga resistance continued through the reign of Rashtrakuta Govinda III and by 819, a Ganga resurgence gained them partial control over Gangavadi under King Rachamalla.Adiga 2006, p118 Seeing the futility of waging war with the Western Ganga, Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I gave his daughter Chandrabbalabbe in marriage to Ganga prince Butuga I, son of King Ereganga Neetimarga. The Gangas thereafter became staunch allies of the Rashtrakutas, a position they maintained till the end of the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta.from the Konnur inscriptions of 860 and Rajaramadu inscription (Adiga 2006, p119)From the Keregodi Rangapura plates and Chikka Sarangi inscription of 903 (Adiga 2006, p119)Kamath (2001), p43 After an uneventful period, Butuga II ascended the throne in 938 with the help of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha III (whose daughter he married).Kamath (2001), p44 He helped the Rashtrakutas win decisive victories in Tamilakam in the battle of Takkolam against the Chola Dynasty. With this victory, the Rashtrakutas took control of modern northern Tamil Nadu.Tirukkalukkunram and Laksmeshwar inscriptions ‚Äì Kanchi and Tanjore were annexed by Krishna III who was an incarnation of death for the Chola Dynasty (Reu 1933, p83)Thapar 2003, p334Sastri 1955, p162 In return for their valour, the Gangas were awarded extensive territories in the Tungabhadra river valley.From the Kudlur inscription of King Marasimha II (Adiga 2006, p120) King Marasimha II who came to power in 963 aided the Rashtrakutas in victories against the Gurjara Pratihara King Lalla and the Paramara kings of Malwa in Central India.From the Kukkanur inscription (Adiga 2006, p122)These victories were recorded in a Kannada inscription of 964 near Jabalpur (Kamath 2001, p83) Chavundaraya, a minister in the Western Ganga court was a valiant commander, able administrator and an accomplished poet in Kannada and Sanskrit.Kamath (2001), p45Sastri (1955), pp356‚Äì357 He served King Marasimha II and his successors ably and helped King Rachamalla IV suppress a civil war in 975. Towards the end of the 10th century, the Rashtrakutas had been supplanted by the Western Chalukya Empire in Manyakheta. In the south, the Chola Dynasty who were seeing a resurgence of power under Rajaraja Chola I conquered Gangavadi around the year 1000, bringing the Western Ganga dynasty to an end. Thereafter, large areas of south Karnataka region came under Chola control for about a century.Kamath (2001), p118 Administration Saint Bharata chakravartin at Shravanabelagola temple complex The Western Ganga administration was influenced by principles stated in the ancient text arthashastra. The praje gavundas mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities similar to those of the village elders (gramavriddhas) mentioned by Kautilya. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked.Kamath (2001), p46 The kingdom was divided into Rashtra (district) and further into Visaya (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and Desa. From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term Visaya was replaced by the Kannada term Nadu. Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000,Adiga (2006), p10 with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash termsRice in Adiga (2006), p15) or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that divisionSharma in Adiga (2006), p16 or the number of villages included in that territory. Inscriptions have revealed several important administrative designations such as prime minister (sarvadhikari), treasurer (shribhandari), foreign minister (sandhivirgrahi) and chief minister (mahapradhana). All of these positions came with an additional title of commander (dandanayaka). Other designations were royal steward (manevergade), master of robes (mahapasayita), commander of elephant corps (gajasahani), commander of cavalry (thuragasahani) etc.Kamath (2001), p47 In the royal house, Niyogis oversaw palace administration, royal clothing and jewellery etc. and the Padiyara were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol.Adiga (2006), p238 Officials at the local level were the pergade, nadabova, nalagamiga, prabhu and gavunda.Adiga (2006), pp161‚Äì177 The pergades were superintendents from all social classes such as artisans, gold smiths, black smiths etc. The pergades dealing with the royal household were called manepergade (house superintendent) and those who collected tolls were called Sunka vergades.From the Kanatur inscription (Adiga 2006, p161) The nadabovas were accountants and tax collectors at the Nadu level and sometimes functioned as scribes.From the Kanatur inscription (Adiga 2006, p164) The nalagamigas were officers who organized and maintained defence at the Nadu level.From the Mavali inscription of the 8th century and Indravalli inscription (Adiga 2006), p165 The prabhu constituted a group of elite people drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries.Doddakunce inscription, the Karagada and Maruru inscription (Adiga 2006, p167‚Äì68) The gavundas who appear most often in inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region. They were landlords and local elite whom the state utilized their services to collect taxes, maintain records of landownership, bear witness to grants and transactions and even raise militia when required.Bedirur inscriptions of 635 (Adiga 2006, p168) Inscriptions that specify land grants, rights and ownership were descriptive of the boundaries of demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (kote) if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included was the type of soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation.From the Kumsi inscription of 931 and Doddahomma inscription of 977 (Adiga 2006, pp21‚Äì22, p27, p29)From the Mavali inscription and Indivalli inscription (Adiga 2006, p31) Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land.From the Devarahalli and Hosur copper plates (Adiga 2006, p33) There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (bedapalli).From inscriptions and literary writings such as Vaddaradhane (920) and Pampa Bharata (940) (Adiga 2006, p36‚Äì37) From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title arasa. The arasas were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king.Adiga (2006), p208 The velavali who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (vele). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.Adiga (2006), pp233‚Äì234 Economy The Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli was an important center of Jainism during the Ganga period. The famous Begur inscription in old Kannada, dated to c. 908‚Äì938 CE, from the rule of Western Ganga dynasty King Ereyappa. The Gangavadi region consisted of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, betel leaves, cardamom and pepper and the semi- malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds and it was also the base for cattle farming.Adiga (2006), p6 The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane, paddy, coconut, areca nut (adeka totta), betel leaves, plantain and flowers (vara vana) were common.from the Melkote copper plates and Mamballi inscriptions, Medutambihalli inscription of the 9th century (Adiga 2006, p53) Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (Katta).Adiga (2006), p42 Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.Adiga (2006), p45 Soil types mentioned in records are black soil (Karimaniya) in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (Kebbayya mannu)from the Narasimhapura plates (Adiga 2006), p46From the Doddahomma inscription of Rachaballa IV of 977 (Adiga 2006, p47) Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land and to a lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called kalani, galde, nir mannu or nir panya and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water.Kittel in Adiga (2006), p48 The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms gosahasra (a thousand cows), gasara (owner of cows), gosasi (donor of cows), goyiti (cowherdess), gosasa (protector of cows) attest to this.Belagi inscription of 964, Sasarvalli inscription of 1001 (Krishna and Adiga 2006, p55/56) Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this.Adiga (2006), p57 Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (pendir-udeyulcal), abduction of women by bedas (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.From the Kodagu inscription of the 11th century, Guduve inscription of 1032, Kambadahalli inscription of 979 (Adiga 2006, p59, p60, p63) Lands that were exempt from taxes were called manya and sometimes consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without any reference to the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished in the line of duty were called bilavritti or kalnad.From the Narasimhapura inscription of the 9th century (Sircar and Ramesh in Adiga 2006, pp210‚Äì211) When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti.Indian epigraphical glossary, Hecca inscription pF 939 for SriKanteshvara temple (Adiga 2006, p213) Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.From Nonamangala copper plates of the 5th century of King Avinita (Adiga 2006, p216)From the Kuppepalya inscription of the 8th century (Adiga 2006, p218) Siddhaya was a local tax levied on agriculture and pottondi was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. Based on context, pottondi also meant 1/10, aydalavi meant 1/5 and elalavi meant 1/7.Kotutu inscription of the 9th century, Rampura inscription of 905 (Adiga 2006, p219) Mannadare literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax (Kurimbadere) payable to the chief of shepherds. Bhaga meant a portion or share of the produce from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as Kirudere (due to the landlords) and samathadere (raised by the army officers or samantha) are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles.Varuna inscription, (Adiga 2006, p223‚Äì224) Bittuvatta or niravari taxes comprised usually of a percentage of the produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.Adiga (2006), p230 Culture =Religion= Footprint worship at Shravanabelagola The Western Gangas gave patronage to all the major religions of the time; Jainism and the Hindu sects of Shaivism, Vedic Brahmanism and Vaishnavism. However scholars have argued that not all Gangas kings may have given equal priority to all the faiths. Some historians believe that the Gangas were ardent Jains.Dr. Lewis Rice, S. R. Sharma and M. V. Krishna Rao However, inscriptions contradict this by providing references to kalamukhas (staunch Shaiva ascetics), pasupatas and lokayatas (followers of Pasupatha doctrine) who flourished in Gangavadi, indicating that Shaivism was also popular. King Madhava and Harivarma were devoted to cows and brahmins, King Vishnugopa was a devout Vaishnava,Srikantha Shastri in Kamath (2001), p49 Madhava III's and Avinita's inscriptions describe lavish endowments to Jain orders and templesAdiga (2006), p249 and King Durvinita performed Vedic sacrifices prompting historians to claim he was a Hindu.Srikanta Sastri in A mantapa (hall) at the Jain Panchakuta basadi of 9th‚Äì10th century at Kambadahalli Jainism became popular in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I constructed numerous Jain basadis.From the Kulaganga and Narasimhapura copper plates (Adiga 2006, p255) King Butuga II and minister Chavundaraya were staunch Jains which is evident from the construction of the Gommateshwara monolith.From the Kudlur plates of Butuga II (Adiga 2006, p256) Jains worshipped the twenty four tirthankars (Jinas) whose images were consecrated in their temples. The worship of the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism.P.B. Desai and Jaiswal in Adiga (2006), pp263‚Äì264 Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali, the son of Tirthankar Adinatha (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva).Adiga (2006), p264 The worship of subordinate deities such as yaksa and yaksi, earlier considered as mere attendants of the tirthankars was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.Adiga (2006), pp264‚Äì265 Gommateshwara at Shravanabelagola (982‚Äì983) C.E. Vedic Brahminism was popular in the 6th and 7th centuries when inscriptions refer to grants made to Srotriya Brahmins.Adiga (2006), p253 These inscriptions also describe the gotra (lineage) affiliation to royal families and their adherence of such Vedic rituals as asvamedha (horse sacrifice) and hiranyagarbha.From the Bendiganhalli and Bangalore copper plates, the Chaluvanahalli plates, Kutalur grant, Kadagattur and Nallala grants of King Durvinita, Kondunjeruvu grant of King Avinita (Adiga 2006, pp281‚Äì282) Brahmins and kings enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship; rituals performed by the brahmins gave legitimacy to kings and the land grants made by kings to brahmins elevated them in society to the level of wealthy landowners.Adiga (2006), p282 Vaishnavism however maintained a low profile and not many inscriptions describe grants towards its cause.Adiga (2006), p313 Some Vaishnava temples were built by the Gangas such as the Narayanaswami temples at Nanjangud, Sattur and Hangala in modern Mysore district.From the Kalkunda inscription (Adiga 2006, pp314‚Äì316) The deity Vishnu was depicted with four arms holding a conch (sanka), discus (cakra), mace (gada) and lotus (padma).Adiga (2006), p317 From the beginning of the 8th century, patronage to Shaivism increased in every section of the society; the landed elite, landlords, assemblies (samaya), schools of learning (aghraharas)Adiga (2006), p291 and minor ruling families such as the Bana, Nolamba and Chalukya clans.From the Nandi copper plates of Rashtrakuta Govinda III of 800, Koyattur-12000 grant of King Dodda Naradhipa Bana in 810, the Ganiganur inscription, Nolamba King Mahendradhirajas grant of his house towards a Shaiva temple in 878, Baragur inscription of 914 of King Ayappadeva Nolamba, the Ninneshvaradeva temple built by King Dilipayya Nolamba in 942.Among minor Chalukya kings, Narasinga Chalukya of Mysore constructed the Narasingeshwara temple and Kings Goggi and Durga build the Buteshvara temple at Varuna in modern Mysore region ‚Äì From the Kukkarahalli, Manalevadi, Aragodupalli and Torevalli inscriptions, (Adiga 2006, 294) The Shaiva temples contained a Shiva linga in the sanctum sanctorum along with images of the mother goddess, Surya (Sun god)This was popularised by the kalamukha monks (Adiga 2006, p292) and Nandi (a bull and attendant of Shiva) which was normally enshrined in a separate pavilion facing the sanctum.Adiga (2006), p301H.V. Stietencron in Adiga 2006, p303 The linga was man made and in some cases had etchings of Ganapati (son of Shiva) and Parvati (consort and wife of Shiva) on it. Due to the vigorous efforts of priests and ascetics, Shaiva monastic orders flourished in many places such as Nandi Hills, Avani and Hebbata in modern Kolar district.From Nandi copper plates of 800, Avani pillar inscription, Perbetta hero stones, 878 inscription of Nolamba Mahendradhiraja, Baragur inscription of 919, 942 Tumkur grant and Basavanahalli inscriptions (Adiga 2006, p304‚Äì305) =Society= Kalleshwara Temple Complex, built in the 10th century by the Nolambas, a Western Ganga feudatory, at Aralaguppe in the Tumkur district Seeyamangalam Mahavira Rock Cut Temple Hero stone (870‚Äì906 A.D.) with old Kannada inscription at Kalleshvara temple in Aralaguppe The Western Ganga society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of KundatturFrom the Kuntur inscription of the 10th century (Adiga 2006, p203) and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi.Karmarkar (1947), p66 Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of nalgavunda (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, the wife of a fallen hero are examples. When Jakkiabbe took to asceticism, her daughter inherited the position.from the Bandalike inscription of 919 (Adiga 2006, p203)From the Shravanabelagola inscription (Adiga 2006, p204) The devadasi system (sule or courtesan) in temples was prevalent and was modelled after the structures in the royal palace.Adiga (2006), p398 Contemporaneous literature such a Vaddaradhane makes a mention of the chief queen (Dharani Mahadevi) accompanied by lower ranking queens (arasiyargal) and courtesans of the women's royal quarter (pendarasada suleyargal). Some of the courtesans and concubines employed in the harem of the kings and chieftains were well respected, examples being Nandavva at whose instance a local chief made land grant to a Jain temple.From the Perur plates (Adiga 2006, p398) Education in the royal family was closely supervised and included such subjects as political science, elephant and horse riding, archery, medicine, poetry, grammar, drama, literature, dance, singing and use of musical instruments. Brahmins enjoyed an influential position in society and were exempt from certain taxes and customs due on land. In turn they managed public affairs such as teaching, local judiciary, functioned as trustees and bankers, managed schools, temples, irrigation tanks, rest houses, collected taxes due from villages and raised money from public subscriptions.Karmarkar (1947), pp. 72, 74 By virtue of a Hindu belief that killing of a brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, capital punishment was not applicable to them.Altekar (1934), p329 Upper caste kshatriyas (satkshatriya) were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand.From the notes of Alberuni and Bouchet (Karmarkar 1947, p103) Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras.From the notes of Yuan Chwang (Karmarkar 1947, p103) Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. if there were no male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as Dharmadeya (charitable asset).From a modern Bijapur inscription of 1178 (Karmarkar, 1947, p104) Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue.The Svayamvara marriage of Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI to Chandaladevi in the 11th century being an example (Karmarkar, 1947 p105) Memorials containing hero stones (virkal) were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.Karmarkar (1947), p109 The presence of numerous Mahasatikals (or Mastikal ‚Äì hero stones for a woman who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of Sati among royalty.From the writings of Marco Polo, Ibn Batuta, Bernier and Tavernier (Karmarkar 1947, p110) Ritual death by sallekhana and by jalasamadhi (drowning in water) were also practiced.Karmarkar (1947), p110 Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore Saris with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds.Karmarkar (1947), p111 Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces (honnasara and honnagala sara), bracelets (Kaduga) and wristlets (Kaftkina). Women wore a nose jewel (bottu), nose ring (mugutti), bangles (bale or kankana) and various types of necklaces (honna gante sara and kati sutra). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, cock fights and ram fights.Karmarkar (1947), p112 There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as agraharas, ghatikas, brahmapura or matha.Karmarkar (1947), p113 Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, Balligavi, Talagunda, Aihole, Arasikere and other places. =Literature= The famous Atakur inscription (949 C.E.), a classical Kannada composition pertaining to the Western Ganga- Rashtrakuta victory over the Chola dynasty of Tanjore in the famous battle of Takkolam The Western Ganga rule was a period of brisk literary activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana (or Trishashtilakshana mahapurana) of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, Adipurana and Uttarapurana which were written a century earlier by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I.Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian 2003, p160 The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly meant for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor Adikavi Pampa and contemporary Ranna. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty- four Jain Tirthankar, twelve Chakravartis, nine Balabhadras, nine Narayanas and nine Pratinarayanas.Sastri (1955), p357Kulkarni (1975) in Adiga (2006), p256 The earliest postulated Kannada writer from this dynasty is King Durvinita of the 6th century. Kavirajamarga of 850 CE, refers to a Durvinita as an early writer of Kannada prose.Sastri (1955), p355Narasimhacharya (1988), p2 Around 900 CE, Gunavarma I authored the Kannada works, Shudraka and Harivamsha. His writings are considered extinct but references to these writings are found in later years. He is known to have been patronised by King Ereganga Neetimarga II. In Shudraka, he has favourably compared his patron to King Shudraka of ancient times.Kamath (2001), p50Narasimhacharya (1988), p18 The great Kannada poet Ranna was patronised by Chavundaraya in his early literary days.One among the three gems of Kannada literature (Sastri 1955, p356) Ranna's classic Parashurama charite is considered a eulogy of his patron who held such titles as Samara Parashurama. Mahasthambha (pillar) and Chandragupta Basadi at Chandragiri Hill in Shravanabelagola Nagavarma I, a brahmin scholar who came from Vengi in modern Andhra Pradesh (late 10th century) was also patronised by Chavundaraya. He wrote Chandombudhi (ocean of prosody) addressed to his wife. This is considered the earliest available Kannada writing in prosody. He also wrote one of the earliest available romance classics in Kannada called Karnataka Kadambari in sweet and flowing champu (mixed verse and prose) style. It is based on an earlier romantic work in Sanskrit by poet Bana and is popular among critics. Gajashtaka (hundred verses on elephants), a rare Kannada work on elephant management was written by King Shivamara II around 800 CE but this work is now considered extinct.Kamath (2001), p50 Other writers such as Manasiga and Chandrabhatta were known to be popular in the 10th century.Narasimhacharya (1988), p19 In an age of classical Sanskrit literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise Dattaka Sutravritti which was based on an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka. A Sanskrit version of Vaddakatha, a commentary on PƒÅ·πáini's grammar called Sabdavathara and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a Sanskrit work called Kiratarjunneya by poet Bharavi (who was in Durvinita's court) are ascribed to Durvinita.Kamath (2001), p49 King Shivamara II is known to have written Gajamata Kalpana. Hemasena, also known as Vidya Dhananjaya authored Raghavapandaviya, a narration of the stories of Rama and the Pandavas simultaneously through puns.Venkatasubbiah in Kamath (2001), p50 Gayachintamani and Kshatrachudamini which were based on poet Bana's work Kadambari were written by Hemasena's pupil Vadeebhasimha in prose style. and Chavundaraya wrote Charitarasara. =Architecture= Chandragiri hill temple complex at Shravanabelagola The Western Ganga style of architecture was influenced by the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to indigenous Jain features.Reddy, Sharma and Krishna Rao in Kamath (2001), pp 50‚Äì52 The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped Vimana of the shrine with horizontal mouldings and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas. The monolith of Gomateshwara commissioned by Chavundaraya is considered the high point of the Ganga sculptural contribution in ancient Karnataka. Carved from fine-grained white granite, the image stands on a lotus. It has no support up to the thighs and is tall with the face measuring . With the serene expression on the face of the image, its curled hair with graceful locks, its proportional anatomy, the monolith size, and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka.Seshadri in Kamath (2001), p51 It is the largest monolithic statue in the world. Their free standing pillars called Mahasthambha or Bhrahmasthambha are also considered unique, examples of which are the Brahmadeva pillar and Tyagada Brahmadeva Pillar.If there is one aspect of Indian architecture which has its perfection and weakness, it is these free standing pillars (Fergusson in Kamath 2001, p52)Sarma (1992), p153, p206, p208 At the top of the pillar whose shaft (cylindrical or octagonal) is decorated with creepers and other floral motifs is the seated Brahma and the base of the pillar normally has engravings of important Jain personalities and inscriptions.In the whole of Indian art, nothing perhaps equals these pillars in good taste, Vincent Smith in Kamath (2001), p52 Ceiling sculpture, Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli Other important contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories (talas) ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) are used at the top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 are the most important monuments at Shravanabelagola.Some historians claim the Chavundaraya basadi was built by Chavundaraya himself while others argue it was the work of his on Jinadevana (Gopal et al. in Adiga 2006, p256). Another view holds that the original shrine was consecrated in the 11th century and built in memory of Chavundaraya (Settar in Adiga 2006, 256) Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation.Adiga 2006, p269 The Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of Dravidian art.Sarma (1992), pp153‚Äì167 The wall niches here are surmounted by torana (lintel) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (gandharva) and imaginary monsters (makara) ridden by Yaksas (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.Adiga 2006, p268 Other notable constructions were the Vallimalai Jain caves and the Seeyamangalam Jain temple during the reign of Rachamalla II,Aravamuthan (1992), p30 and the 5th or 6th century Parshvanatha temple at the Kanakagiri Jain tirth.Jain (2019), p18 Chavundaraya basadi on Chandragiri hill in Shravanabelagola temple complex The Gangas built many Hindu temples with impressive Dravidian gopuras containing stucco figures from the Hindu pantheon, decorated pierced screen windows which are featured in the mantapa (hall) along with saptamatrika carvings (seven heavenly mothers).Kamath (2001), p51 Some well known examples are the Arakeshvara Temple at Hole Alur,Sarma (1992), pp.105‚Äì111 Kapileswara temple at Manne, Kolaramma temple at Kolar, Rameshvara temple at Narasamangala,Sarma (1992), pp91‚Äì102 Nagareshvara temple at BegurSarma (1992), pp78‚Äì83 and the Kallesvara temple at Aralaguppe.Sarma (1992), pp88‚Äì91 At Talakad they built the Maralesvara temple, the Arakesvara temple and the Patalesvara temple. Unlike the Jain temples where floral frieze decoration is common, Hindu temples were distinguished by friezes (slab of stone with decorative sculptures) illustrating episodes from the epics and puranas. Another unique legacy of the Gangas are the number of virgal (hero stones) they have left behind; memorials containing sculptural details in relief of war scenes, Hindu deities, saptamatrikas, Jain tirthankars and ritual death (such as the Doddahundi hero stone).Sarma (1992), p17, p202, p204 =Language= Old Kannada inscription at the base of Gomateshwara monolith in Shravanabelagola (981 CE.) The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit extensively as their language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions tended to be in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language.Thapar 2003, pp393‚Äì394 The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350‚Äì725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration and the fact that majority of the records from this phase were brahmadeya grants (grants to Brahmin temples).Adiga (2006), p110 In the second phase (725‚Äì1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith.Thapar 2003, p396 Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early copper plate bilingual inscriptions dated 444. The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village. An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern Bangalore that deserves mention is the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a Bengaluru war. This is in Hale Kannada (old Kannada) language and is the earliest mention of the name of Bangalore city. The Western Gangas minted coins with Kannada and Nagari legends,Kamath (2001), p12 the most common feature on their coins was the image of an elephant on the obverse and floral petal symbols on the reverse. The Kannada legend Bhadr, a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image. The denominations are the pagoda (weighing 52 grains), the fanam weighting one tenth or one half of the pagoda and the quarter fanams.  Timeline  The template below shows the Timeline of Karnataka. Note the extent of time (around 700 years) the Ganga kingdom flourished. See also * History of India * History of South India Notes Bibliography Books    Web * \\"Gangas of Talakad\\" by S.

Didim is the site of the antique city of Didyma with its ruined Temple of Apollo. Etymology Didim takes its name from ancient Didyma, situated close to the modern town. During the Ottoman Empire era, the town was known as Yoranda or Yoran, and under the modern Republic of Turkey, it was originally named Hisar (\\"Castle\\"). Following its destruction in an earthquake in 1955, the town was rebuilt and renamed Yenihisar (\\"New Castle\\"). The town was part of S√∂ke district until 1991. The area became a top-level district of Aydƒ±n Province and was given the ancient name Didim in 1997 to distinguish it from the many other places in Turkey named Yenihisar. Geography Didim is located on the north shore of the gulf of G√ºll√ºk, opposite Bodrum peninsula villages such as Torba, T√ºrkb√ºk√º, and Yalƒ±kavak. In antiquity, this formed the Posideium Peninsula but silt from the Meander River has since filled in the inlet to its north, connecting it more thoroughly to the mainland. Didim's district consists of Didim itself, a coastal town of 26,000 people, and a number of small towns including Altƒ±nkum (which means \\"golden sand\\"), G√ºm√º≈ükum (\\"silver sand\\") and Sarƒ±kum (\\"yellow sand\\"). Its neighbours are S√∂ke from north-east and Milas from south-east. Tourism is the main source of income for the area, especially in summer, but agriculture is also an important contributor; the main crops are wheat and cotton. Animals, especially sheep and goats, are raised mainly for local consumption.  Geographic divisions  Altinkum- West Yalƒ±k√∂y - West Mavi≈üehir - West Mersindere - West Cumhuriyet - Central Efeler - Central Yenimahalle - Central √áamlƒ±k - South - third beach, main beach, and D-Marin Didim Altƒ±nkum - South - main beach and second beach Fevzipa≈üa - South Ye≈üilkent - South/East History The area was settled in the neolithic period, established as colony of Crete and then Mycenae in the 16th century BC and subsequently possessed by Lycians, Persians, Seleucids, Attalids, Ancient Romans, and Byzantines as part of the province of Caria. The area came into the hands of Turks following the defeat of Byzantium at the Battle of Malazgirt in 1086. The town was captured again by the Byzantines in 1098, by Mente≈üe in 1280, and then Aydinids in 1300. Didim was brought into the Ottoman Empire by sultan Mehmed I in 1413. At Ottoman Empire Didim's name Was \\"Yoran\\". Tourism Altƒ±nkum This coast has become a very popular holiday resort, known for its long sandy beaches, clear blue sea, ancient ruins, and its own microclimate, benefiting from hundreds of days of sun annually and warm winters, allowing residents to use the beaches and engage in watersports even in January. Less frequented beaches are ones further from the centre, such as Haydar, along a dirt road around the shore of Akb√ºk (meaning \\"white bay\\"). Recent renewal of main roads means the area is easily served by Bodrum and ƒ∞zmir airports. Because of Didim's location, people in the 1980s came from large cities around Turkey, especially Ankara, began to buy holiday homes, apartments, and villas in the area. Most of these were built as cooperative housing projects with private beaches. The attraction of the area is proved by the number of Ankara families that have now been going to Didim for two or more generations. Property values have recently been rising, and the building boom continues as foreign buyers, especially the families of Turks living and working in Europe, follow their lead. The growth of Didim in the 1980s was further accelerated with the building of hotels to accommodate visitors, originally from Britain but now from Turkey itself, on inexpensive package holidays. Since about 2000, British people have begun to buy holiday homes in Didim, establishing themselves as a visible community of many thousands, to the extent that utility bills in the district are now printed in English as well as Turkish.Elsewhere  Weekend  Guardian Unlimited Many bars around Didim are noted for having the Union Jack hanging inside. Didim town has hotels, a weekly market, a waterpark, and the antique Temple of Apollo nearby. Didim is also close to a number of other ancient towns and natural formations, such as Lake Bafa national park, the B√ºy√ºk Menderes River, and historic sites like Miletus and Priene. Didim has a number of discoth√®ques, smaller bars, and clubs, some with live music, mostly T√ºrk√º (Turkish folk music). Rakƒ± consumption is popular among tourists and residents in Didim. The local station, Didim TV, is an amateur project by a television repair shop owner and neighbourhood councillor (muhtar), and is mostly advertisements for local shops and hotels. Recently, a $50 million Didim Marina (D-Marin Didim) was constructed by Doƒüu≈ü Holding and became operational in 2009 with berths for 8 m to 50 m boats, 400-ton boat lift, dry docks, hangars, maintenance yard, yacht club, shopping mall, restaurants, and visitor facilities. The new marina is expected to encourage further tourism and rising property prices in the area.

The Gorantla inscription traces their origins to this region from the time of the Western Chalukyas and Kalachuris of Karnataka.Durga Prasad, p219 The term \\"Saluva\\" is known to lexicographers as \\"hawk\\" used in hunting. They later spread into the east coast of modern Andhra Pradesh, perhaps by migration or during the Vijayanagara conquests during the 14th century. The earliest known Saluva from inscriptional evidence in the Vijayanagara era was Mangaldeva, the great grandfather of Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya. Mangaldeva played an important role in the victories of King Bukka Raya I against the Sultanate of Madurai. His descendants founded the Saluva Dynasty and were one of the ruling lines of the Vijayanagara Empire of Southern India. Three kings ruled from 1485 to 1505 after which the Tuluva Dynasty claimed the throne. They ruled almost the entire South India with Vijaynagara as their capital. Saluva Narasimha was the first king of the dynasty ruling from 1486‚Äì1491. Narasimha spent his reign in relatively successful campaigns to reduce his vassals throughout the kingdom to submission and in unsuccessful attempts to stop the encroachment of the Suryavamsa king of Orissa. Narasimha also opened new ports on the west coast so that he could revive the horse trade, which had fallen into Bahmanƒ´ hands. At his death in 1491, following the siege of Udayagiri and his own imprisonment there by the Suryavamsi king of Orissa, Narasimha left his kingdom in the hands of his chief minister, Narasa Nayaka. The King did not think his sons were ready to take charge of the throne so he gave that power to his most trusted general and minister Narasa. The minister in effect ruled Vijayanagar from 1490 until his own death in 1503. Narasimha's eldest son, Thimma Bhupa, was murdered by an army commander and one of Narasa's enemies in 1492 so Narasimha's youngest son, Narasimha Raya II, ascended his brother to the throne as king. He was enthroned as Immadi Narasimha. Although he was named king, the authentic control came from Narasa's eldest son and successor, best known as Vira Narasimha. He ordered the murder of Immadi Narasimha in 1505. He then ascended the throne and inaugurated the Tuluva dynasty, the third dynasty of Vijayanagar and reigned from 1503-1509 Notes References * WebPage by Dr. Jyothsna Kamat * Durga Prasad, History of the Andhras Till 1565 A.D., P.

In 1950, India became republic and different provinces were formed in the country on basis of language spoken in the particular region and this gave birth to the state of Mysore including various places in south India, which were earlier ruled by the kings. On 1 November 1956, Mysore state, comprising most of the area of the erstwhile princely state of Mysore, was merged with the Kannada-speaking areas of the Bombay and Madras presidencies, as also of the principality of Hyderabad, to create a unified Kannada-speaking sub national entity.

The first Alpha Micro computer was the S-100 AM-100, based upon the WD16 microprocessor chipset from Western Digital. Later computers starting with the AM-100/L and the AM-1000 were based on the Motorola 68000 and succeeding processors, though Alpha Micro swapped several addressing lines to create byte-ordering compatibility with their earlier processor. Early peripherals included standard Computer terminals (such models as Soroc, Hazeltine 1500, and Wyse WY50), Fortran punch card readers, 100 baud rate acoustic coupler modems (later upgraded to 300 baud modems), and 10 MB CDC Hawk hard drives with removable disk packs. The company's primary claim to fame was selling inexpensive minicomputers that provided multi-user power using a proprietary operating system called AMOS (Alpha Micro Operating System). The operating system on the 68000 machines was called AMOS/L. The operating system had major similarities to the operating system of the DEC PDP-11. This may not be coincidental; legend has it that the founders based their operating system on \\"borrowed\\" source code from DEC, and DEC, perceiving the same, unsuccessfully tried to sue Alpha Micro over the similarities in 1984.Moore, Steve (6/1984). \\"Here come the clones.\\" AMUS.LOG, p67. As Motorola stopped developing their 68000 product, Alpha Micro started to move to the x86 CPU family, used in common PCs. This was initially done with the Falcon cards, allowing standard DOS and later Windows-based PCs to run AMOS applications on the 68000-series CPU on the Falcon card. The work done on AMPC became the foundation for AMOS 8.x, which runs natively on x86, but includes a 68K emulator to run older software in a method similar to Apple Inc.'s Mac 68k emulator for PowerPC. For application development, AMOS used a proprietary BASIC-like language called AlphaBASIC (though several other languages, including Assembler, FORTRAN, Pascal, and COBOL, were available). Older versions interpreted a tokenized executable file. Later versions translate the tokenized executable into x86 code for performance. Other programming languages included AlphaFortran, AlphaLisp and AlphaPascal. In the past, Alpha Micro bundled their operating system and tools such as BASIC and their ISAM implementation as part of the hardware sale, also providing patches and OS upgrades for free or at minimal cost. Gradually, Alpha Micro has transitioned to charging for their software as hardware becomes more of a commodity item. Alpha Microsystems package often included software that allow traditional multi-user systems, like AMOS and others such as Sun, DEC, HP and IBM mainframes to interface with Microsoft Windows graphical user interface and supported peripherals. This software would function similar to Citrix or the X Window System. The Alpha Micro computer has never achieved mainstream name recognition, though it has been traditionally popular in certain vertical markets, particularly medical, law, and dental offices. There were two organizations which produced periodic newsletters and held annual meetings; AMUS (Alpha Micro Users Society), and IAMDA (International Alpha Micro Dealer's Association). It was typically at these annual meetings that the latest hardware and software products were announced by Alpha Microsystems and third party developers.

The only described species, Kakuru kujani, is known primarily from evidence of a single tibia, which had been fossilised through a rare process in which the bone through hydration turned to opal. The bone was dug up at the opal fields of Andamooka, South Australia. The opalised tibia was exhibited by a gem shop in 1973 and by chance brought to the attention of paleontologist Neville Pledge. The owner at the time, a certain A. Fleming, allowed pictures and two casts to be made but eventually the specimen was sold at an auction to an anonymous buyer. It was presumed lost to science. In 2004, however, the South Australian Museum succeeded in procuring the fossil for $22,000. Kakuru was formally named in 1980 by Pledge and Ralph Molnar.R. E. Molnar and N. S. Pledge, 1980, \\"A new theropod dinosaur from South Australia\\", Alcheringa 4: 281-287 The type species is Kakuru kujani. The generic name is that of a Rainbow Serpent of Australian Aboriginal mythology. The specific name is that of the local aboriginal tribe, the Kujani or Guyani. Possible phalanx One of the casts is the plastoholotype, SAM P17926. The specimen was discovered in the marine Marree Subgroup dating to the Aptian. Apart from the tibia, the find included some small probable fibula fragments. Later a foot digit was referred that might have come from the same species, specimen SAM P18010, but the assignment is dubious. The tibia is broken into about ten larger pieces and roughly 33 centimetres long. It is very slender in build and shows the impression of the ascending process of the astragalus, an ankle bone itself lost. The process seems to have been very long and narrow. Kakuru is believed to have been carnivorous, was bipedal and about two to three meters in length. This small dinosaur seems to have had long, slender legs. Due to the paucity of the remains it has been difficult to establish the phylogenetic position of Kakuru. Molnar and Pledge gave no more precise determination than a Theropoda incertae sedis. The tibia provides two indications: its gracile form and the tall height and narrow width of the astragalar process. Both seems to point to the Coelurosauria, perhaps the Oviraptorosauria. However, in 2005 Oliver Rauhut pointed out that the Abelisauroidea also have a high ascending process of the astragalus.

Background At this time, the administrative county of Cleveland, established in 1974 from parts of Yorkshire and County Durham in the Teesside area, included four main towns: Stockton-on-Tees, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough and Redcar. It ceased to exist in 1996. History In the years prior to the scandal, levels of reported child abuse in the Cleveland area were consistent with those of other parts of the United Kingdom. However, in 1987, during the period of February to July, many children living in Cleveland were removed from their homes by social service agencies and diagnosed as sexually abused. The 121 diagnoses were made by two paediatricians at a Middlesbrough hospital, Marietta Higgs and Geoffrey Wyatt, using the later-discredited diagnostic of reflex anal dilation. When there were not enough foster homes in which to place the allegedly abused children, social services began to house the children in a ward at the local hospital. Later, the test being used to establish child abuse was contested by the area police surgeon, and cooperation between the social workers, police and hospital doctors involved in diagnosis began to disintegrate. In addition, there was public concern regarding the practices being used by the local social service agency, such as the removal of children from their homes in the middle of the night. In May 1987, parents marched from the hospital where their children were being held to the local newspaper. The resulting media coverage caused the social service agency's practices to receive public scrutiny and criticism. In response, the Butler-Sloss report was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Social Services in July 1987 and published in 1988. The report was led by Elizabeth Butler-Sloss and it concluded that most of the diagnoses were incorrect. As a result, 94 of the 121 children were returned to their homes.Staff writer, The Cleveland Report digest by Robert Shaw, Children Webmag 2011, accessed July 17, 2014 An editorial in The Lancet concluded: \\"The kindest description of Dr Marietta Higgs and Dr Geoffrey Wyatt would be to say that they were naive, but naivety should not number among a consultant paediatrician's characteristics. By their bull-headed approach, Dr Higgs and Dr Wyatt... have set back the cause they sought to promote.\\" In July 1988, six MPs tabled a House of Commons motion for charges of indecent assault and conspiracy to be brought against Higgs and Wyatt. On 14 October 1991, the Children Act 1989 was implemented in full as a result of the Cleveland child abuse scandal and other child related events that preceded it. In 1997, a controversial television documentary, The Death of Childhood, claimed that \\"independent experts under the guidance of the Department of Health later found that at least 70 per cent of the diagnoses\\" were correct. According to the documentary, two years after the scandal a number of children were again referred to social services and determined to be at risk for child abuse. In February 2007, Sir Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer, who was the regional medical officer at the time of the scandal, said of the original diagnoses: \\"The techniques that have been used have not been reliable and it does look as if some mistakes have been made.\\" A few days later, two of the children who had been the focus of the scandal asked the Middlesbrough police for an investigation of their 1987 experience.

Joining in early 2005, Richardson replaced Between the Buried and Me's former drummer Jason Roe. Biography Richardson attended middle school at Calvary Baptist Day School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He later attended Mt. Tabor High School and performed an annual drum solo for a school-club project named 'Spartan Spectacular'. Playing since he was 11 years old, he became an immediate fan of 1990s grunge music. Being inspired by bands such as Soundgarden, Nirvana, and Smashing Pumpkins, his passion for heavy music grew as much as his love for drumming did. After taking lessons for several years from local jazz percussionist/drummer Robert Crutchfield, he developed his skills and started playing with his first band, Glass Casket, at the age of 17. After significant touring throughout the US, he graduated high school in 2003 and attended NC State University for two years. After getting an offer to play drums for home-state friends Between the Buried and Me he helped to start writing the band's third full-length album Alaska and finally left school in 2005 to tour full-time. Since then the band has toured relentlessly. Sharing the stage with friends in Black Dahlia Murder, Bleeding Through, Every Time I Die, and Dillinger Escape Plan helped land them a spot on Ozzfest 2006 with System of a Down and Ozzy Osbourne. After seemingly endless touring to support his first album with Between the Buried and Me, the band began writing for their fourth studio album Colors. This album helped push the band, as well as Richardson's drumming style, into the more progressive metal element. Not going unnoticed, the band's developed new sound and groundbreaking new album helped them earn a spot on the first ever \\"Progressive Nation Tour\\", which featured Dream Theater, Opeth, and Three. Style Richardson's drumming is characterized by a fusion of death metal elements as well as jazz influences. Noted for his blast beats, odd timing, double bass drumming, and fill-heavy style, Richardson is considered a standout in his field. His favorite drummers include Terry Bozzio, Dennis Chambers, Dave Grohl, Simon Phillips, Dave Weckl, Morgan √Ögren, Virgil Donati, Ken Schalk and Tomas Haake. During the Progressive Nation 2008 tour Blake performed alongside Mike Portnoy (ex-Dream Theater) where the two soloed together.

The work concentrates primarily on the history of Medieval Armenia and events occurring in the Caucasus and Near East. The work serves as a primary source for the study of the Mongol invasions and even contains the first recorded word list of the Mongolian language.Zgusta, Ladislav, Franz J. Hausmann and Oskar Reichmann (eds.). An International Encyclopedia of Lexicography. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1991, p. 2368. . The work has been translated into several languages including Latin, French and Russian. Life Kirakos was born in the city of Gandzak (Ganja, presently in Azerbaijan) in or around 1200. He attended the school of New Getik in the village of Tandzut in the region of Kayen (classes were originally taught in a cave and it was only later that they relocated to a one-room building).Hacikyan et al. Armenian Literature, p. 493. He was the pupil of Vanakan Vardapet, a scholar and native from his native Gandzak. In 1215, Kirakos along with his classmates and their teacher Vanakan moved to study at the monastery at Khoranashat in Tavush. With the Mongol invasion of the 1230s, Kirakos and his mentor were captured by Mongol forces in the spring of 1236. As captives, however, he and Vanakan managed to serve as secretaries for the Mongols. During this time, Kirakos learned the Mongolian language and he later compiled his knowledge of it into a list of 55 words with their corresponding Armenian meanings. A ransom was paid to free Vanakan in the summer of that year but Kirakos also managed to escape the same night and returned to the town of Getik.Bedrosian, Robert. Kirakos Ganjakets'i's History of the Armenians: Translator's Preface. Robert Bedrosian‚Äôs Homepage. New York, 1986. Accessed March 7, 2008. Following Vanakan's death in 1251, Kirakos assumed his former teacher's duties and became the head of the school in New Getik. In 1255, he was granted an audience with the leader of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, Hetum I, in the town of Vardenis (in Aragatsotn), informing him of missionary work in the region. He remained in New Getik for several more years; he died in 1271 and was buried there. Works Kirakos completed several works in his lifetime; however, his most prominent is that of History of Armenia (’ä’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂ ’Ä’°’µ’∏÷Å). He began to write the book on May 19, 1241 and completed it in 1265. Divided into two parts, the first part of the History of the Armenians begins with the life of Gregory the Illuminator, the patron saint of the Armenian Apostolic Church, and is devoted largely to the history of the Armenian church from the third century to the twelfth century. The second part of History focuses on the ramifications and physical damage inflicted against the people of the region by the Turkic and Mongol invasions, including the torture and death of Hasan-Jalal, the prince of Khachen. Approximately 47 facsimiles of the 65 chapters of History of Armenia survived and can be found in numerous repositories located around the world including the Matenadaran in Yerevan, Armenia and museums in Vienna, London, Paris, and St. Petersburg.

The company was organized in Maryland with its headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio. As of December 31, 2017, the company owned 29 office buildings, 29 shopping centers, and 78 apartment complexes. On December 7, 2018, the company was acquired by Brookfield Asset Management. History In 1920, Forest City was founded as a family-owned lumber and household hardware business by siblings Charles Ratner, Leonard Ratner, Max Ratner, and Fannye Ratner, immigrants from Poland. Beginning in the 1930s, the company invested in residential garages, apartments, retail strip centers. During World War II, the company manufactured and prefabricated governmental housing. In 1960, Forest City became a publicly traded company. In 1987, the company sold its retail lumber business to Handy Andy Home Improvement Center. In 2011, the company sold a 49% stake in a retail portfolio in New York for $172.3 million. In 2013, the company acquired a 100% interest in a mall in Pittsburgh. The company also sold a Sheraton hotel in Station Square in Pittsburgh for $61 million. It also announced plans to redevelop Ballston Common Mall. The company acquired a key parcel from Macy's for $13.4 million. In 2016, for tax purposes, the company converted into a real estate investment trust. The company also sold its stake in the Brooklyn Nets and the Barclays Center to Mikhail Prokhorov, sold its military housing division to Hunt Companies for $208.8 million, sold Terminal Tower to K&D; Group for $38.5 million, and sold 7.7 acres and 8 buildings in Cleveland to an investor group for $3.5 million. In June 2017, Forest City shareholders voted to eliminate the dual share structure that had enabled the founding Ratner family to control the company. The City of New York also filed a lawsuit against the company in conjunction with the rent due pursuant to a ground lease. In August 2017, the company sold 25 acres in Cleveland. In October 2017, the company sold its interests in 10 malls to Queensland Investment Corporation for $1.55 billion. On December 7, 2018, the company was acquired by Brookfield Asset Management.

The term is generally used to refer to men and women who exert political influence and are not elected representatives to state, territory or federal legislative bodies, yet are elected representatives to bodies that determine political party policies. However, the political tactic of elected representatives canvassing party members for support on policies varies widely amongst Australian political parties. Use of term =Referring to the Australian Labor Party= The term was first used in 1963 by Alan Reid, a journalist working for Sir Frank Packer's conservative Sydney Daily Telegraph, to refer to the 36 members of the Australian Labor Party's Federal Conference, which at that time decided elements of the party's election policy. In the run-up to the campaign for the 1963 federal election, Reid commissioned a photograph of Labor Leader Arthur Calwell and his Deputy Leader Gough Whitlam standing outside the Kingston Hotel in Canberra, where the Conference was meeting, waiting to be told on what policy they were to fight the election. Neither Caldwell or Whitlam were delegates to the Conference, which then consisted of six delegates from each of the six states. Reid commented that the ALP was ruled by \\"36 faceless men\\". In actual fact, there was a woman, Phyllis Benjamin of Tasmania, among the delegates at the Conference at the time. By Robert Menzies The line was used effectively by the Liberal Party and its leader, Prime Minister Robert Menzies. The Liberal Party produced a leaflet headed: \\"Mr Calwell and the Faceless Men\\". The leaflet described Conference delegates as \\"36 unknown men, not elected to Parliament nor responsible to the people.\\" This tactic helped Menzies win the election with an increased majority, and led directly to Whitlam's campaign to reform the Labor Party's structure when he succeeded Calwell as party leader in 1967. The term \\"faceless men\\" henceforth became a permanent part of Australia's political lexicon, nearly always being used in a pejorative sense when making reference to the Labor Party. During 2010 and subsequent use The term was revived in 2010 when a group of Labor factional leaders, including Bill Shorten, David Feeney, Mark Arbib and Don Farrell, with the support of the union leader Paul Howes, arranged for the Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to be removed as party leader and replaced by deputy leader Julia Gillard. Howes later published a book called Confessions of a Faceless Man. The expression was also used to refer to the figures in the NSW branch of the Labor Party, such as Karl Bitar and Arbib who brought about the successive removals of Morris Iemma and Nathan Rees as Premier of New South Wales. The term returned to prominence in February 2012, when Rudd resigned as Minister for Foreign Affairs and announced he would challenge Gillard in an attempt to regain the Labor leadership. Rudd stated: Rudd later stated that \\"..reform of the Labor Party itself, so that our party is equipped for the tasks of the 21st century.

In response, Labor MP Michael Danby, a Gillard supporter, said that Rudd had his own \\"faceless men\\", notably the lobbyist Bruce Hawker. Hawker replied: \\"I don't want to be a faceless man.

She is nicknamed La Leona Dormida (a title of one of her songs which translates to \\"The sleeping lioness\\"). Biography She started her career in showbusiness with her father Poncho D'Alessio who had a musical show called La Familia D'Alessio on a Tijuana television station. She then moved to Mexico City and released a single \\"Mi Coraz√≥n es un Gitano\\", a cover of the Italian song \\"Il Cuore √® Uno Zingaro\\" which won the Sanremo Music Festival, both in 1971. Then she was selected to perform the theme song of the telenovela of Televisa titled Mundo de juguete. She was invited to take roles on Ana del Aire and other productions in the 1970s and 1980s. Lupita sang the title song of telenovela Pacto de Amor, where she also acted. In 1978, she won the Mexican national final to select the country's entrant in the seventh edition of the OTI Festival which was held in Santiago, Chile. Her entry, entitled \\"Como t√∫\\" (Just like you) was received with critical acclaim and as a result she got the third place in the contest. This fact helped her to consolidate her musical career in Mexico. In 1980, Lupita was one of the main characters in Ernesto Alonso's Aprendiendo a Amar, where she played the role of her older daughter (the younger daughter was played by Erika Buenfil). The telenovela starred Susana Dosamantes (mother of Paulina Rubio). Lupita also sang the theme song \\"A M√≠\\". She performed concerts on tour in Central and South America. In 1986, Lupita starred in the movie Mentiras alongside Juan Ferrara, where she played Lupita Montero, an aspiring singer; she performed several songs for the soundtrack of the movie, including \\"Mudanzas\\". In 1987, she appeared in the short telenovela Tiempo De Amar, alongside Fernando Allende. Her last project of the 1980s was 1989's \\"Qui√©n te crees t√∫\\", the theme to her last finished acting project, telenovela Lo Blanco y lo Negro. In 2000, she accepted a telenovela role in TV Azteca's Ellas, inocentes o culpables, although she left the production after a month. She returned to Televisa in 2002 for a guest appearance on the situation comedy La Jaula with Cesar Bono, Carlos Eduardo Rico, and Sheyla Tadeo. For her work in television and as a recording artist, D'Alessio has her handprints and star imbedded on the Paseo de las Luminarias in Mexico City. In 2011, she participated as a critic in several episodes of Parodiando. In 2018, she starred her own biography on the mini series Hoy voy a Cambiar, adding another big number one hit together with the song Yo Sigo Aqui.

It was originally part of the San Jose Symphony as the San Jose Symphony Youth Orchestra (SJSYO). However, in 2002, when the San Jose Symphony was going through financial problems, SJSYO separated itself from the San Jose Symphony and became the San Jose Youth Symphony. SJYS consists of two full symphony orchestras (the Philharmonic and Concert Orchestras), a Chamber Orchestra, two preparatory string ensembles (the Intermezzo and Prelude String Ensembles), and five other instrumental ensembles (the Avant and Avance Flute choirs, the Percussion Ensemble, the Concert Wind Ensemble, and the Harp Ensemble). SJYS has received the Ambassador's Award for Cultural Diplomacy for its performances in Poland as well as letters of commendations from both the City of San Jose and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. As a non-profit organization, the San Jose Youth Symphony is supported by the Silicon Valley Arts Council, the City of San Jose, the San Jose Symphony Foundation, the Steinway Society, and various other foundations and corporations. Ensembles =Philharmonic Orchestra= The Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Maestro Yair Samet, is SJYS's premiere orchestra. Simply referred to as the 'Phil', it is composed of approximately 100 musicians mostly of high-school age. Three concerts are offered each season, usually during December, March and June. The orchestra has performed various works across the classical music spectrum, including works of Antonio Vivaldi, Piotr Tchaikovsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Franz Liszt, √âdouard Lalo, Aaron Copland, and George Gershwin. In addition, the orchestra frequently plays with professional musicians (such as Jon Nakamatsu and Axel Strauss), winners of the Symphony's Young Artist Competitions, and, formerly, winners of the Philharmonic Concerto Competitions (at present discontinued). Philharmonic Orchestra has also partnered with various other musical groups in the past, including Chanticleer, San Jose Taiko, Crystal Children's Choir, Children's Musical Theatre of San Jose, and other assorted non-profit or fundraising groups. Benefit Concerts The Phil is also known for performing in benefit concerts, in which the net proceeds from sold tickets (and, if present, auctions) are donated to welfare causes. In 2008 and 2009, all the various groups in SJYS performed in charity concerts for Kenya Dream, a program that is raising a minimum of $100,000 to be donated to a secondary school in Kenya. In March 2010, the Phil dedicated their second set concert to Chile, which had suffered a massive earthquake weeks before the concert. Because Phil members had toured Santiago in the summer of 2009, the SJYS Board decided to donate all the net proceeds from the March concert to Chile, even though it was a season concert. Furthermore, every Christmas season, the Phil performs a free benefit concert at St. Joseph's Cathedral for the Season Of Hope performance series. Tours Every other year, the Phil conducts an international tour. During the usually-two-week-long trip, the musicians are given the chance to visit important monuments and buildings, spend some time with renowned soloists and ambassadors, and perform in some of the most prestigious concert halls in the world. Often the Phil also combines with the countries' youth orchestras to perform massive joined concerts. Past tours have taken place in Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Japan, and Spain. In the summer of 2009, the Philharmonic was the first California-based youth orchestra to tour South America, namely the countries of Chile and Argentina. In the summer of 2011, the Phil visited Italy, Austria, and Germany. The highlight of this tour was their concert at the world-renowned Mozarteum in Salzburg. In the summer of 2019, they visited Montevideo, Uruguay, as well as Buenos Aires and Rosario, Argentina. The Phil had the opportunity to perform in the world famous, Teatro Col√≥n. =Chamber Orchestra= The Chamber Orchestra is a new addition to SJYS, created in 2010. Conducted by Yair Samet, who also conducts the Philharmonic, this ensemble is a level between the Concert and the Philharmonic Orchestras. Like the Phil, Chamber Orchestra is composed mostly of high school students; however, since it is oriented towards chamber music, it sports considerably fewer members. While the Chamber Orchestra will usually perform as an entire ensemble, members will be given the chance to play in smaller chamber as well. Samet states that \\"It has been a long dream of SJYS to establish a premiere Chamber Orchestra.\\" =Concert Orchestra= The Concert Orchestra, currently conducted by Ryo Fukuda, is one of the two full orchestras in SJYS, with the other being the Philharmonic. It is an intermediate-level ensemble with a mission of providing its musicians with a firsthand experience of playing in a full orchestra. Unlike the Philharmonic, the Concert Orchestra does not embark on international tours, but it still has its own unofficial Concerto Competition within the orchestra. Several conductors have led the Concert Orchestra over the course of SJYS, and many of these conductors have gone on to successfully pursue other musical careers. Ben Jones, who conducted the Concert Orchestra from 2007‚Äì2009, joined the Grammy award-winning men's choir, Chanticleer. =Avant Flute Choir= The Flute Choir is the only ensemble in SJYS dedicated solely to one instrument. It has been conducted by professional flutist Teresa Orozco-Petersen since it was created. In the eight years it has existed, the Flute Choir has grown from 11 to nearly 30 members. The repertoire consists of both classical pieces arranged for flute ensembles and modern pieces covering genres such as jazz, pop, and ethnic. Members are often encouraged to play alto flute or bass flute for these pieces. =Concert Winds= The Concert Wind Ensemble is directed towards woodwind and brass players at the intermediate level. It is also aimed at proficient young musicians who express the desire to learn a woodwind or brass instrument. Led by Charles Ancheta, Concert Winds focuses on repertoire arranged for bands. The relatively small number of members allows for intimate practice and musical development. =Intermezzo String Ensemble= The Intermezzo String Ensemble mostly consists of former members of the Prelude String Ensemble. Conducted by Victoria Morton, Intermezzo musicians graduate from learning technical skills and begin to develop musicality that will help prepare themselves for playing in a full orchestra. While in Prelude the musicians focus on rhythm, dynamics, and other mechanical techniques, Intermezzo teaches the students skills such as listening. =Prelude String Ensemble= The Prelude String Ensemble, conducted by Christina Wong, gives beginning musicians a chance to play in a collective group with each other. In addition to learning music theory, the students also get their first tastes of playing in an ensemble and following a conductor. Many young violinists, violists, and cellists of elementary-school age begin their first year in SJYS in Prelude and progress through the various ensembles as the years go by. =Percussion Ensemble= The Percussion Ensemble is conducted by Jeff Wilson. Members of the Percussion Ensemble play a wide range of percussion instruments, from drums to marimbas and even ethnic percussion. Aside from the usually modern repertoire, the percussionists also learn about instrument care, setting up, and advanced musical techniques. Summer Camp New and returning musicians alike are required to participate in a weeklong summer camp before the official season begins, where they are given the chance to meet their conductors and get to know their fellow SJYS members. While the Prelude, Intermezzo, and Chamber Orchestra musicians attend a day camp together, usually at J.F.S. Elementary School in San Jose, all other ensembles (Flute Choir, Wind Ensemble, Concert Orchestra, and Philharmonic Orchestra) spend the week overnight at Santa Clara University. Those at the overnight camp also attend sectionals with professional orchestra musicians as well as master classes with renowned musicians; Phil and Concert members are also required to go through seating auditions. Rehearsals Rehearsals and the official SJYS season begin in September, usually within the first couple of weeks, and end with the last season concert, usually in June. SJYS has rehearsed in many well-known institutions in the Bay Area, including the San Jose Civic Auditorium, the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts, Castillero Middle School, and River of Life Christian Church. Currently, most of the ensembles rehearse in the Los Gatos United Methodist Church on Monday evenings. Only three ensembles do not ‚Äì the Chamber Orchestra rehearses at Archbishop Mitty High School on Sunday afternoons (because the conductor cannot be in two places at once), Concert Winds at Branham High School on Monday evenings, and the Percussion Ensemble at Valley Christian High School on Wednesday evenings. Those ensembles with older students tend to rehearse longer than the preparatory and intermediate ensembles; the Phil and Chamber Orchestra rehearse for three hours as compared to two for Prelude and Intermezzo. Rehearsals occur almost every week, even on holidays such as Labor Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day. There is, however, a two-week break in December for the holidays. Concerts Musicians are required to perform in two or three concerts with their respective ensembles. These are season concerts, which demonstrate the students‚Äô progress with SJYS. Each season concert has a different repertoire, but the members may receive some or all of the music at summer camp. With the exception of the Phil, the season concerts usually consist of two or three ensembles at the same venue. The usual groupings follow: *Prelude and Intermezzo currently perform at the Jewish Community Center of Silicon Valley *Flute Choir and Concert Orchestra (joined by Chamber Orchestra in the last concert) currently perform at Archbishop Mitty High School *Concert Winds and Percussion Ensemble perform at Valley Christian High School *Phil performs independently at the California Theatre In addition to these places, SJYS has performed their season concerts at San Jose State University and Le Petit Trianon Theatre. =Other Concerts= In addition to the season and summer camp concerts, SJYS members may be asked to perform in other concerts for special occasions. Two notable examples are the annual Phil holiday concert at Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph and the Phil's Bon Voyage Concert featuring all musicians going on tour. It is not only the Philharmonic that performs these additional concerts ‚Äìother ensembles are often called on to perform at senior homes, holiday concerts, and many other special venues. The Flute Choir, for example, has performed annually at the Tree Lighting Ceremony in Santana Row. Occasionally all ensembles are invited to perform for a special cause, such as Kenya Dream.

A layman of the princely Pahlavuni family that claimed descent from the dynasty established by St. Gregory the Illuminator, he was the son of the military commander Vasak Pahlavuni. After the Byzantine Empire annexed the Kingdom of Ani, Gregory went on to serve as the governor (doux) of the province of Edessa. During his tenure he worked actively to suppress the Tondrakians, a breakaway Christian Armenian sect that the Armenian and Byzantine Churches both labeled heretics.See Babken Arakelyan (1976), ¬´’ç’∏÷Å’´’°’¨’°’Ø’°’∂ ’∑’°÷Ä’™’∏÷Ç’¥’∂’•÷Ä’® ’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂’∏÷Ç’¥ IX- XI ’§’°÷Ä’•÷Ä’∏÷Ç’¥¬ª [Social movements in Armenia, 9th-11th centuries] in ’Ä’°’µ ’™’∏’≤’∏’æ÷Ä’§’´ ’∫’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂ [History of the Armenian People], eds.

He collected all Armenian manuscripts of scientific or philosophical value that were to be found, including the works of Anania Shirakatsi, and translations from Callimachus, Andronicus of Rhodes and Olympiodorus. He translated several works of Plato ‚Äî The Laws, the Eulogy of Socrates, Euthyphro, Timaeus and Phaedo. Many ecclesiastics of the period were his pupils. Foremost among his writings are the \\"Letters,\\" which are 80 in number, and which provide information about the political and religious problems of the time. His poetry bears the impress of both Homeric Greek and the Arabic of his own century. His chief poetical work is a long metrical narrative of the principal events recorded in the Bible. This work was purportedly written in three days in 1045 at the request of a Muslim scholar, who, after reading it, converted to Christianity. Grigor was almost the first poet to adopt the use of rhyme introduced to Armenia by the Arabs. Grigor II Vkayaser, a son of Grigor Magistros, was the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church between 1066 and 1105. Like his father, he was also a scholar and author; his name Vkayaser (\\"Lover of martyrs\\") refers to his work compiling and editing the lives of Armenian martyrs. Thomas F.

Electronic pianos work similarly to analog synthesizers in that they generate their tones through oscillators, whereas electric pianos are mechanical, their sound being electrified by a pickup and then amplified through an internal or external amplifier. The first electronic pianos date from the 1970s and were mostly made in Italy , although similar models were made concurrently in Japan. An exception is the range of instruments made by RMI in the United States from 1967 to approximately 1980, which was used by Genesis, Yes, Deep Purple, Elton John and Rick Wakeman . These early electronic pianos (including the RMI) are not velocity sensitive in that, like an organ, they do not vary their volume based on how hard or soft the keys are played. \\"The major drawback of the RMI was its total lack of touch sensitivity. I found this very restricting, especially since any bum- notes are played at full volume, no matter how lightly you brush against them\\" (Tony Banks, quoted in ). The first electronic grand piano was produced in 1979 and patented in 1981 by Wil Decker of St. James, NY. (PianoNova Co.) It contained the first full-touch-sensitive keyboard and working pedals . Electronic pianos became less popular in the 1980s when the digital piano and polyphonic synthesizer became available and affordable enough for both professional and home use as an inexpensive, smaller and lighter alternative to an acoustic piano. In modern usage, the term electronic piano sometimes refers to either a digital piano or a stage piano. This is actually a misnomer, as electronic pianos use analog synthesis to generate its sounds while digital pianos normally use sample-based synthesis. In addition, early digital pianos in the mid-1980s were often referred to as a personal electronic piano.

It is the capital of an administrative department in the Diourbel region. Along with the nearby city of Touba, Mback√© forms an urban conurbation whose population currently stands at about 500,000, making it Senegal's second largest agglomeration. It is connected to Dakar and Touba by the N3 road. History Mback√©, also known as Mback√©-Baol, was founded in the sparsely populated wilderness of Eastern Baol in 1796 by Mame Maram Muhammad al-Khayri (d. 1802), great-grandfather of Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mback√©. Mame Maram was a reputed Muslim jurisconsult. He received the land grant to establish Mback√© from the king of Baol, Amari Ngon√© Ndella Fall, who was also king of neighboring Cayor. During the first half of 19th century Mback√© was a well- known center of Islamic learning. It was destroyed by Maba Diakhou, the Tijani jihadist from the Rip, in 1865 and the Mback√© family, including the young Ahmadou Bamba, was forced to join Maba's court in Nioro. Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba returned to Mback√© in 1884 when he embarked upon his spiritual career. Due to the pressure of his growing following of disciples, Bamba soon moved away from the town, settling first in Darou Salam (now a suburb of Mback√©) and then in Touba, eight kilometers (5 mi) further to the north-east. A spur of the Dakar- Niger railway was built to Mback√© in 1931, at which point the French colonial authorities laid out an \\"escale\\" neighborhood by the train station. A variety of businesses: wholesalers and traders, then opened shop. In 1952, Mback√© was raised to the rank of \\"commune\\" (equivalent to limited municipal status) and in 1958 it became the seat of an administrative subdivision (later called a \\"department\\"). Its population at that time was approximately 7000. The phenomenal growth of near-by Touba began to impact developments in Mback√© in the 1970s. Many of its commercial establishments, including bank branches, relocated to the autonomous holy city of the Mourides, where taxation and real-estate are more favorable. However, as Mback√© lies beyond Touba's sacred precincts, it fulfills certain auxiliary functions, such as public administration and secular entertainment, forbidden in that holy city.

They claim that they had previously been lifelong Conservative and Labour Party voters respectively, Leon-Smith serving as a councillor for 6 years, but had become disillusioned by the breaking of the link between pensions and average earnings by the Conservatives and Labour's failure to restore it. They also campaigned against council tax, proposing a local income tax, and campaign for free personal care for the elderly, free off-peak travel, and free television licences. The party won 42,861 votes in the South East in the European Parliament election, 2004 and stood candidates against Tony Blair and Michael Howard in the 2005 UK general election. Leon-Smith received 151 votes (0.3%) in Folkestone and Hythe, and Pattinson received 97 votes (0.2%) in Sedgefield.

The Hollow-Face illusion (also known as Hollow-Mask illusion) is an optical illusion in which the perception of a concave mask of a face appears as a normal convex face. While a convex face will appear to look in a single direction, and the gaze of a flat face, such as the Lord Kitchener Wants You poster, can appear to track a moving viewer, a hollow face can appear to move its eyes faster than the viewer: looking forward when the viewer is directly ahead, but looking at an extreme angle when the viewer is only at a moderate angle. According to Richard Gregory, \\"The strong visual bias of favouring seeing a hollow mask as a normal convex face is evidence for the power of top-down knowledge for vision\\". This bias of seeing faces as convex is so strong it counters competing monocular depth cues, such as shading and shadows, and also very considerable unambiguous information from the two eyes signalling stereoscopically that the object is hollow. (Lighting a concave face from below to reverse the shading cues making them closer to those of a convex face lit from above can reinforce the illusion.) The Hollow- Face illusion has been used to study the dissociation between vision-for- perception and vision-for-action (see Two-streams hypothesis). In this experiment, people used their finger to make a quick flicking movement at a small target attached to the inside surface of the hollow ‚Äì but apparently normal ‚Äì face, or on the surface of a normal protruding face. The idea was that the fast flicking (rather like flicking a small insect off the face) would engage the vision-for-action networks in the dorsal stream ‚Äì and thus would be directed to the actual rather than the perceived position of the target. The results were clear. Despite the presence of a robust illusion in which people perceived the hollow face as if it were a normal protruding face, the flicking movements they made were accurately directed to the real, not the illusory location of the target. This result suggests that the bottom-up cues that drive the flicking response are distinct from the top-down cues that drive the Hollow-Face illusion. Another example of the Hollow-Face illusion is the \\"Gathering 4 Gardner\\" dragon. This dragon's head seems to follow the viewer's eyes everywhere (even up or down), when lighting, perspective and/or stereoscopic cues are not strong enough to tell its face is actually hollow. Keen observers will note that the head doesn't actually follow them, but appears to turn twice as fast around its center than they do themselves. The Hollow-Face illusion is weaker among people with schizophrenia and other populations with psychotic symptoms, perhaps as a result of reduced tendency to interpret any kind of ambiguous 3D object as convex. It appears to be related to current mental state, namely in regard to current positive symptoms, inappropriate affect, and need for structure. The illusion seems to strengthen among successfully treated patients. Further examples File:Snow Face 8496.jpgHollow-face in snow Image:Hollow dragon front.jpgAn optical illusion.

The stories often feature the company Weyland-Yutani and the United States Colonial Marines. Originally intended as a sequel to James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens, the first mini-series features the characters of Rebecca \\"Newt\\" Jorden and Corporal Dwayne Hicks. Later series also included the further adventures of Ellen Ripley, with other stories being completely unique to the Alien universe and are often used to explore other aspects of the species, such as their sociology and biology, and also tying into Dark Horse Comics' Predator and Aliens vs. Predator lines. Concept The heads of Dark Horse Comics made a decision early on to not publish ongoing or unlimited titles from the license and compose the line as a series of limited series, one-shots and short stories with a main focus on limited series because they believed that it would allow more creative freedom and flexibility for the writers and artists. Dark Horse hasn't published any original graphic novels on the concept. History The first three stories formed a continuation of the two Alien films that had been released by the time they were published. However, 1992 saw the release of Alien 3, which contradicted the events of the comics by beginning with the deaths of Newt and Corporal Hicks. In order to keep the stories relevant to the main Alien film series, Dark Horse changed the names of the characters for future printings of the stories. Newt became Billie while Hicks was now known as Wilks. The only other major difference between the original publications is that as well as being renamed the trade paperbacks were also recolored. Between 1999 and 2008 the line was on hiatus. Publications Dark Horse has produced a number of Aliens comic books and collected volumes: =Initial works= * Aliens 1‚Äì6 (by Mark Verheiden and Mark A.

Story summary =Outbreak= Outbreak starts 10 years after the events of Aliens. Ripley's fate is not revealed to the reader, but Hicks and Newt have been struggling with the aftermath of their encounter with the Xenomorphs. Newt is in a mental institution suffering horrible recurring nightmares, and when nothing seems to help her, the doctors decide to wipe her memory. The badly-scarred Hicks, facing constant fears from his fellow Marines that he is somehow contaminated by the Aliens, has never gotten over the annihilation of his squad, and so agrees to go on a mission to the alien homeworld to recover some eggs and to destroy one of the hives (the hive-destroying serves no purpose other than to satisfy Hicks' hatred). Hicks goes to visit Newt before he departs, only to learn about the planned memory-wipe. Hicks believes Newt to be the only thing that marks his existence and honors his squad's sacrifice, so he extracts her from the institution and smuggles her on board the ship flying to the homeworld. Said ship departs, but is trailed by another, manned by a crew of corporate mercenaries intent on keeping the Aliens' secrets for their paymasters. Meanwhile, strange things are happening on Earth. A scientific corporation has acquired an alien queen, and begins harvesting eggs, intent on creating bio-weapons. A weird cult that believes the Aliens to be God's spiritual rebirth breaks in and its members voluntarily give themselves up for facehugging. They spread the Alien infection across the planet and Earth is soon overrun. While traveling to the home world, Newt falls in love with a Marine named Butler. Arriving in orbit the home world, their ship is boarded and taken over by the mercenaries, thanks to the assistance of the squad's traitorous leader, who promptly is executed by the mercenaries' amoral leader Massey. Newt is overlooked in this process, and hides in the ship's ventilation shafts. The squad is sent by the mercenaries towards the hive with the intent of having them infected with Alien facehuggers to allow for further research, but the mercenaries are forced into the hive themselves when attacked by another hostile species on the planet, this one capable of flight. The squad gathers weapons, and go into the hive to rescue their surviving attackers. The casualties taken during this operation reveal why they undertook this course of action: they are all unknowing synthetic humans, created and trained to be utterly expendable cannon-fodder, but nevertheless installed with an overpowering instinct to save human life. Back on the ship, Newt kills Massey, but is distraught to learn that Butler, while surviving being torn in half, is one of the synthetics. Hicks almost kills them all by waiting until he has planted the nest-destroying charges before taking off, but they receive last-minute Alien-killing assistance from a living \\"Space Jockey\\", a member of the enigmatic species who originally built and launched the derelict ship whose cargo of eggs led to humanity's first encounter with the Aliens. Newt is able to receive terrifying and cryptic psychic messages from the Jockey. Hicks and Newt receive word of the Alien invasion of Earth, but decide to return home anyway, accompanied by the Jockey in his/its own ship. Upon arrival, they are told by a general that Earth's armed forces are abandoning the planet, planning to return once the Alien infestation has run its course and repopulate. There is a mass exodus from Earth, most of the survivors being military. Hicks, Newt and Butler join this flight, commandeering one of the fleet's many unmanned cargo ships. The Jockey remains behind in orbit; as she departs, Newt receives a final psychic warning that any returning humans will find it still there.. waiting. =Nightmare Asylum= Script by Mark Verheiden, art and title illustration by Den Beauvais and lettering by Willie Schubert. The story continues where Outbreak left off, with Newt, the synthetic Butler, and Hicks a short time after having escaped the alien-infested Earth on a cargo ship. The crew discovers the ship is ferrying aliens to an unknown destination. After killing the aliens, the ship autopilots to a military post commanded by General Spears, who is breeding and attempting to train aliens to fight against their own kind on Earth. He is depicted as ruthless, and is called insane by several characters. Throughout the story it is revealed that Spears is extremely paranoid about his own safety and the safety of his aliens, and is willing to sacrifice his own troops without hesitation. As the story progresses, the aliens inevitably escape captivity and begin taking over the military base. Hicks and Newt manage to hide on the same ship General Spears uses to escape. Once aboard the ship Hicks and Newt realize it is full of \\"trained\\" aliens that Spears intends on using to take back the infested Earth. The synthetic Butler also manages to send a transmission saying goodbye to Newt as they were separated in the middle of the story. Since Butler is a synthetic and torn in two the aliens do not engage him in any way. Butler is left alone and abandoned in the military base. Before Spears lands on Earth Hicks and Newt jettison out in a small escape pod towards a different space station called Gateway, which becomes a haven for the few people capable of reaching, aware that their chances of survival on Earth are slim. Once Spears lands on Earth he releases his \\"trained\\" aliens and expects them to attack the Earth-bred aliens. The \\"trained\\" aliens end up turning on Spears. In the end Spears realizes that the aliens were never actually trained, but simply remaining patient throughout their supposed training. The Queen and the other aliens had every intention of getting to Earth and killing Spears. Spears is brutally killed at the end of this realization. On the final page, Ellen Ripley appears, heavily armed, saying the time has come to take the battle to the xenomorphs.

Life Braunfels in 1902 Walter Braunfels was born in Frankfurt am Main. His first music teacher was his mother, the great-niece of the composer Louis Spohr . He continued his piano studies in Frankfurt at the Hoch Conservatory with James Kwast . Braunfels studied law and economics at the university in Munich until after a performance of Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde he decided on music. He went to Vienna in 1902 to study with the pianist and teacher Theodor Leschetizky. He then returned to Munich to study composition with Felix Mottl and Ludwig Thuille . In February 1918 he was wounded at the front and in June 1918 on his return to Frankfurt converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, composing his Te Deum of 1920‚Äì21 \\"not as music for musicians but as a personal expression of faith\\" (Braunfels, cited in ). He achieved early success with the melodious opera Die V√∂gel (The Birds, 1920), such that Adolf Hitler, not realising that Braunfels was half-Jewish, in 1923 invited Braunfels to write an anthem for the Nazi Party, which Braunfels \\"indignantly turned down\\" . Braunfels performed as a professional pianist for many years. In 1949 he played Beethoven's Diabelli Variations on a radio broadcast. At his farewell concert as pianist on 19 January 1952, he played Bach's D major Toccata, Beethoven's piano sonata no. 32 op. 111 and the arrangement of the Organ Fantasy and Fugue in G minor by Liszt . Braunfels was invited by Konrad Adenauer, then mayor of Cologne, to serve as the first director (and founder together with Hermann Abendroth) of the Cologne Academy of Music (Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln) from 1925 to 1933, and again from 1945 to 1950 (; ; ). With the rise of the Nazis to power he was dismissed, and listed as being half- Jewish in the Nazi list of musicians composing what the regime called degenerate music. He retired from public life during the Hitler years but continued to compose. The war passed peacefully for Braunfels and his wife, though his three sons were conscripted into the Wehrmacht . After World War II, he returned to public life and on 12 October 1945 again became director, and in 1948 president, of the Cologne Academy of Music and further enhanced his reputation as a music educator with high ideals . Work as composer Walter Braunfels was well known as a composer between the two World Wars but fell into oblivion after his death. There is now something of a renaissance of interest in his works. His opera Die V√∂gel, based on the play The Birds by Aristophanes, was recorded by Decca in 1996 and has been successfully revived (for example, by the Los Angeles Opera in 2009). In 2014 Die V√∂gel was staged in Osnabr√ºck and Der Traum ein Leben in Bonn. Braunfels's music is in the German classical-romantic tradition. His Phantastische Erscheinungen eines Themas von Hector Berlioz is a giant set of variations. \\"Structurally the work has something in common with Strauss' Don Quixote‚Äîon LSD,\\" noted David Hurwitz of ClassicsToday. \\"The orchestral technique also is quite similar, recognizably German school, with luscious writing for violins and horns, occasional outbursts of extreme virtuosity all around, and a discerning but minimal use of additional percussion\\" . Braunfels composed music in a number of different genres, not only operas, but also songs, choral works and orchestral, chamber and piano pieces.

Position.Brskovo (–ë—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≤–æ) (German: Biersgau, in old local German records Byrsgaw) is a village in northern Montenegro, within the Municipality of Mojkovac which used to have silver mines and a mint. Brskovo encompasses the whole complex of smaller localities, today overgrown with dense wood and weeds, between the Rudnica and Bjelojeviƒái, the tributaries of the Tara River. Brskovo was first mentioned between 1219 and 1228, in a trade charter of Stefan the First-Crowned, addressed to the Republic of Ragusa. The Latin name for Brskovo was Brescoa, and it used to be the centre of a district. Having been regularly visited by merchants from Kotor and Dubrovnik, this town with the Virgin's church administered by the Dominicans from Dubrovnik, had been at its zenith in the 1280s, while from 1350 onwards, it completely declined. As a mine, Brskovo was established by the Saxons inhabiting this area. They had their prince and Catholic priests. During its golden age, at the time of Stefan Uro≈° I, a customs office existed in Brskovo as well as, a century later, a consulate of Dubrovnik. Money called ¬´Grossi de Brescova¬ª was minted in Brskovo. Dante in his Paradiso mentions the mines and mint in Chapter XIX, pp. 139-141. In 1399, the Turks took Brskovo, and according to Dubrovnik sources, in 1433 it was an abandoned place. On the whole inland territory of present-day Montenegro, Brskovo was the only commercial centre whose importance could measure up to that of the coastal towns. Not even coastal towns could boast about such value of production and income. At a dominant position, remains of a fortification ‚Äì Hill-fort‚Äì i.e. a town controlling nearby and the more distant area is situated.

This byname had earlier been given to a theologian and was transferred to the philosopher. Due to confusion with other authors called David and due to an abundant body of medieval legend, almost nothing is known with certainty about the historical David. Armenian tradition makes him a native of Taron, but this is not substantiated in contemporary sources and may be due to conflation with another person.Valentina Calzolari: David et la tradition arm√©nienne.

He supposedly received the byname \\"invincible\\" for his exceptional oratory and argumentative skills. David is said to have returned to his native Armenia later in life, where he was active as a teacher, but he was persecuted by the church and ultimately died in exile in Haghbat. Of the number of works attributed to him, many are pseudepigraphic or doubtful. The works which can be attributed to him with certainty or at least with some plausibility are not scholarly treatises but propedeutic (introductory) handbooks for use in teaching beginners. They were composed in Greek but survive only in Armenian translation. Philologically, these translations are important representatives of the \\"hellenizing\\" tradition in Armenian literature (Yownaban Dproc‚Äò) of the 6th to 8th centuries.Valentina Calzolari: Aux origines de la formation du corpus philosophique en Arm√©nie: quelques remarques sur les versions arm√©niennes des commentaires grecs de David.

Part of the Chattanooga Campaign, it followed a heavy Confederate loss at the Battle of Missionary Ridge from which General Braxton Bragg's artillery and wagon trains were forced to retreat south. The five hour Battle of Ringgold Gap resulted in the Confederate victory of Major General Patrick R. Cleburne and gave the Army of Tennessee safe passage to retreat through the Ringgold Gap mountain pass. Background The disastrous Confederate rout at Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25 forced the Army of Tennessee to retreat into northwest Georgia. On November 26, the army made its way south towards Dalton.Grear, p. 132. To allow time for his artillery and wagon trains to safely pass through the gap, Confederate General Braxton Bragg sent Patrick Cleburne's unit of 4,157 menBohannon, p. 246. to defend it from the Union army. While Cleburne expressed doubt he could defend the gap adequately with his single division, Bragg refused to send any further troops to assist Cleburne.McDonough, pp. 220-222. Cleburne and his men proceeded south and reached Ringgold around 10:00p.m.Grear, p. 133. After crossing through the East Chickamauga Creek, Cleburne's army made camp in the mountain pass known as the Ringgold Gap. All accounts the Union received about Bragg's army suggested a hasty and unorganized retreat following the Battle of Missionary Ridge.Grear, p. 137. The Union commander at Chattanooga, Ulysses S. Grant, had ordered a pursuit of the retreating Confederate army on the morning of November 26, but confusion over the orders prevented the Union forces from getting an early start.Cozzens, pp. 362-66. General Joseph Hooker was given command of divisions from the IV Corps, XI Corps, XII Corps, and XV Corps and sent to cut off the Western and Atlantic railroad in pursuit of the Confederate rear guard.Grear, p. 136. However, when the Union forces arrived, they found that the Confederates had burned the bridges over Chickamauga Creek. Having finally reached Ringgold Gap around 10:00p.m., Hooker halted two and a half miles from the Confederate army during the night of November 26‚Äì27. =Plans and movement to battle= Upon the Confederate army's arrival at Ringgold Gap, Cleburne deployed his men in three strategic locations ‚Äî at Taylor's Ridge, White Oak Mountain, and within the gap itself. To the south, three Alabama regiments were stationed in the woods of Taylor's Ridge under the leadership of Major Frederick Ashford.Grear, p. 135. Brigadier General Mark Perrin Lowrey and Lucius Polk's troops of the Confederate Reserve were sent to guard the passage at Taylor's Ridge.Bohannon, p. 247. Further north, Brigadier General Hiram B. Granbury's Texas brigade was sent to defend against attack from White Oak Mountain. To his right, Major William Taylor was stationed with members of the 17th, 18th, 24th, and 25th Texas cavalry. Inside Ringgold Gap, Brigadier General Daniel Govan led four Arkansas divisions alongside Captain C.E. Talley of the 7th Texas.Bohannon, pp. 247-48. Cleburne's tactical position was completed with the placement of two cannons at the opening of the gap along with a regiment under the leadership of Richard Goldthwaite.Grear, p.136 Around 8:00a.m. on the morning of November 27, Hooker dispatched Major General Peter Osterhaus and his division to scout the area. While out, they encountered Cleburne's watchmen, who raced back to the Ringgold Gap to inform Cleburne of their encounter and the impending battle. Opposing Forces =Union= Ulysses S. Grant had the following forces available in the Battle of Ringgold Gap under the leadership of Joseph Hooker: * The Second Division of the XII Corps, under Brigadier General John Geary.Grear, p.143 ** 1st Brigade, under Colonel William Creighton and Lieutenant Orrin Crane, consisting of the 7th Ohio, 66th Ohio, 28th Pennsylvania, and 147th Pennsylvania.Townsend, p.140 ** 3rd Brigade, under Colonel David Ireland, consisting of the 60th New York and 149th New York.Cozzens, p.374 * The First Division of the XV Corps, under Brigadier General Peter Osterhaus.Grear, p.135 ** 1st Brigade, under Brigadier General Charles Woods, consisting of the 13th Illinois, 3rd Missouri, 12th Missouri, 29th Missouri, 31st Missouri, and 76th Ohio.Townsend, p.138 **2nd Brigade, under Colonel James Williamson, consisting of the 4th Iowa, 9th Iowa, and 26th Iowa. =Confederate= Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee had the following forces available in the Battle of Ringgold Gap under the leadership of Patrick Cleburne: * Liddell's Brigade, under Colonel Daniel Govan, consisting of eight Arkansas regiments including the 2nd Arkansas, 5th Arkansas, 6th Arkansas, 7th Arkansas, 8th Arkansas, 13th Arkansas, 15th Arkansas, and 19th Arkansas.Bohannon, p.247 * Lowrey's Brigade, under Brigadier General Mark Lowrey, consisting of three Alabama regiments under Major Frederick Ashford and three Tennessee regiments. * Polk's Brigade, under Brigadier General Lucius Polk, consisting of the 1st Arkansas and three Tennessee regiments including the 2nd Tennessee, 35th Tennessee, and 48th Tennessee. * Smith's Brigade, under Colonel Hiram Granbury, consisting of the 7th Texas under Captain Charles Talley and the Texas Cavalry under Major William Taylor.Grear, p.135; Townsend, p.138 * Semple's (Alabama) Battery of the Artillery Battalion, under Lieutenant Richard Goldthwaite.Townsend, p.136 Battle Battle of Ringgold Gap, map by Hal Jespersen. Arriving at his lookout point from the depot,Townsend, p.135 Hooker saw a small line of infantrymen and decided to deploy his forces into the gap without his artillery.Grear, p.137;Townsend, p.138 Under the command of General Charles Woods, his brigade entered the gap, but were quickly driven back by Granbury's unit. The Confederates held their fire until the Union line was fifty yards away.Cozzens, pp. 374-79; Broome, pp. 37-29. Upon Cleburne's orders, Goldthwaite's men fired three shots from the disguised twelve-pound Napoleon cannons while the rest of the Army of Tennessee exchanged fire with the bluecoats. Believing they could gain a tactical advantage, Woods sent the 13th Illinois right to seek shelter in the buildings of Jobes Farm.Townsend, p.139 After another failed attempt against Cleburne's troops, Woods' troops were halted by gunfire from Taylor's Ridge and cannon fire from within the gap. To counter the opposition, Osterhaus sent the 76th Ohio and 4th Iowa to attack the Confederate forces on Taylor's Ridge.Grear, p.139 The initial volley disorganized Osterhaus's division and his Union forces were unable to advance from their position for the remainder of the battle. John Geary's XII Corps division was the next to arrive around 10:40a.m. Under the command of David Ireland, one brigade again attacked the Confederate right while another regiment attacked the gap. As they moved further into the gap, both forces were halted by heavy Confederate fire from Taylor's Ridge and White Oak Mountain. Simultaneously, William Creighton and Orrin Crane's 1st Brigade was sent to support Williamson's 2nd Brigade on White Oak Mountain. The brigade was driven back by Polk and Lowrey's regiments, and Creighton was killed during an attempt to rally his men against the Confederates.Townsend, p.141 After holding his position for five hours,Cozzens, p. 384; Broome, p. 40. Cleburne received communications from Bragg around 12:00 p.m. notifying him that the army had made it safely through the gap and he could begin his retreat. Leaving skirmishers along his front to hide his withdrawal, he pulled back from the gap about 2:00p.m. and burned the bridge on the eastern side of the gap. Grant arrived near the gap at this time and, due to the scattered position of his army, decided to return to Chattanooga; no further Union pursuit was organized.Broome, p. 40; Cozzens, pp. 384-85. Cleburne had lost 20 killed and 201 wounded during the battle. Union casualties totaled 509 killed and wounded. Although Hooker was severely criticized for his conduct of the battle by Union Assistant Secretary of War Dana and several of Hooker's men, Grant choose to retain Hooker temporarily.

On the ex-Great Western Railway Cheltenham to Stratford line, the station opened in 1912 to serve the new racecourse at Prestbury Park, home of the famous Gold Cup meeting. The platforms were later extended to accommodate trains of up to 14 carriages. The station was only opened on race days and so facilities were rudimentary, but it continued to serve racegoers until the 1976 Cheltenham Festival. Although most of the stations on the line closed in 1960 the line itself remained open for non-stop passenger services until 1968. Special trains on racedays only served Cheltenham Racecourse station from 1971 until 1976. The line was also used as a diversionary route with no scheduled passenger services until 1976 when a freight train derailed at Winchcombe and damaged the track. The line was officially closed in 1976 and the track was lifted shortly afterwards. Cheltenham Racecourse is now the southern terminus of the 12-mile long heritage Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway, run entirely by volunteers. The line has been reopened in stages. The line trackbed itself was bought in 1984. The track from Gotherington to the racecourse was relaid in 2001. The line was reopened as a heritage railway by the Princess Royal on 7 April 2003. The station is in a cutting fringed by Corsican pine trees. Its northern end, where it emerges from the cutting, affords views towards Cleeve Hill. The original station booking office is believed to be the only remaining example of a Swindon-built flatpack prefabricated building that was brought by train and assembled on site. It is perched at the top of the cutting, next to the A435 roadbridge and close to the main entrance of the racecourse. It has a collection of artifacts housed within it. A gentle slope gives access to the platform where there is a new station building with a canopy, toilets and waiting room. The station has two tracks, one adjacent to the platform and the other to allow locomotives to run around the train. A new signal box was opened in 2005 to control the signals and point work around the station. Access to the station by car is only via the main racecourse entrance. There is a large free car park. A bus service runs from the Network Rail Cheltenham Spa station, through the town centre to the Racecourse Park and Ride, about 10 minutes walk from the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Steam Railway station.  Platform 2 Resurrection  In 2012, as part of a new Development Foundation, the GWSR launched an appeal to reconstruct Platform 2 at Cheltenham Racecourse station. Reconstruction of Platform 2 was completed in 2016.

The first episode determines the winner of a battle between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops, and the second compares the strength of an ankylosaur and Velociraptor. The episodes were broadcast on BBC 1 in August and September 2005. In the U.S., The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs was known as Dinosaur Face-Off. Episodes and animals These are the episodes and the evidence revealed in them. =1 T. rex vs. Triceratops= Tyrannosaurus rex, with a similar design to what is seen on the documentary  Tyrannosaurus  *Evidence of head injuries on Triceratops indicates Tyrannosaurus rex attacked living Triceratops. *Using a steel Tyrannosaurus skull, scientists learned that Tyrannosaurus could easily crush a small car. *Scientists learn that Tyrannosaurus could run at a maximum of . *Scanning an endocast from Tyrannosaurus's skull, scientists theorize that Tyrannosaurus had a brain similar to that of a modern-day alligator. *Tyrannosaurus had good vision, and a good sense of smell. *Tyrannosaurus could bite through bone, at a bite force of at least four tons per square inch.  Triceratops  *Doing a crash test with an artificial Triceratops skull, made of resin, scientists learn that, contrary to portrayals in the media, Triceratops probably did not charge at predators nor other dinosaurs, for its skull would likely break. *Triceratops may have gored its predators. *Triceratops was slower () than Tyrannosaurus, but more agile.  Outcome  An even match. In the episode, it is shown that if the Tyrannosaurus makes a surprise attack, it might kill the Triceratops, but if the herbivore discovers the trap, it could beat his opponent and kill it. Outcome 1: (Winner, Tyrannosaurus) The T. rex is seen stalking the Triceratops. It suddenly runs out of hiding, and being faster, it overtakes the Triceratops. The T. rex bites into the Triceratops' neck, knocks it over, and eats it. Outcome 2: (Winner, Triceratops) The T. rex is wandering through the forest looking for food. It soon comes across two fighting Triceratops. When the two are done fighting, the T. rex singles out one of them as a potential target. After picking its victim, the T. rex charges, but the Triceratops sees it just in time and turns around to face its attacker. The T. rex seizes the horn of the Triceratops and breaks it off. The herbivore tries to retreat, but the T. rex chomps on the Triceratops' frill. After doing a mock charge, the Triceratops slashes its horns into the T. rex's belly. The T. rex limps away, falls down, and slowly dies. The Triceratops watches it die and then goes back to foraging. =2 Velociraptor vs. Ankylosaur=  Velociraptor  *Velociraptor was only the size of a turkey. *Velociraptor had feathers. *A robotic Velociraptor leg provides evidence that Velociraptor did not disembowel its prey.Manning, P. L., Payne, D., Pennicott, J., Barrett, P. M., & Ennos, R. A. (2006). Dinosaur killer claws or climbing crampons?. Biology Letters, 2(1), 110-112. *The fossil of a Velociraptor fighting a Protoceratops shows that the Velociraptor pierced the neck of its prey, possibly to stab the vital arteries or the jugular vein. *Velociraptor's wings were used for balance and agility, much like the wings of an ostrich. *Along with its claws, Velociraptor's teeth were useful weapons. *Velociraptor most likely hunted in small packs. *Teeth of this dinosaur were found among its victims. *The biomechanical claw provides evidence that the Velociraptor could not penetrate the ankylosaur's armour; it broke when tested on a crocodile's skin. Ankylosaur *Ankylosaur armour was similar to a crocodile's, though significantly harder. *Young crocodiles have no armour, especially on the neck. Baby ankylosaurs were probably similar. *A robotic ankylosaur tail shows that the tail club could break wood and bone with ease. *This dinosaur's armour and club was used only on more threatening predators than Velociraptor. *In the U.S version, it was known as Ankylosaurus, although Ankylosaurus itself lived in North America. The ankylosaur in question may in fact have been Pinacosaurus.  Outcome  The ankylosaur would win, although Velociraptor could easily kill young ankylosaurs, which have easily penetrable armor. Outcome 1: (Winner, ankylosaur) The ankylosaur is being harassed by two Velociraptors. They try to attack it multiple times, but its armor proves too thick. The ankylosaur eventually drives them away by swinging its tail (one blow would have killed one of the Velociraptors). Outcome 2: (Winner, Velociraptor) The mother ankylosaur is grazing and her young browse very close to her to avoid danger, but one of them wanders off to an unsafe distance. Two Velociraptors lay a trap around the baby; one of them bursts out of cover to stampede the baby, and the baby escapes the Velociraptor, only to be driven into the clutches of the other one. The two Velociraptors attack the baby, slashing with their claws. The baby tries desperately to defend itself with its tail, but it is inexperienced and is quickly overwhelmed. One of the Velociraptors drives a claw into the baby's neck, killing it. The two Velociraptors have the baby as a meal.  Minor appearances  = Tarbosaurus = *Tarbosaurus appears in the second episode briefly. It fights the ankylosaur, and loses (the tail club breaks its leg). *It was related to Tyrannosaurus. *It was the top predator in the Mongolian plains. = Protoceratops = *Protoceratops appears briefly in two fights against Velociraptor. The first is a re-enactment of the fighting dinosaurs scene, while the second pits it against two Velociraptors, where the latter wins. *Its beak and bony head were powerful weapons, but because of its small size, Protoceratops was most likely preyed upon by many Mongolian predators.

Bush's foreign policies as \\"unilateralist.\\" Reviews The book, written by a conservative, is critical of the policies and practices of George Bush. The author examines many issues where the U.S. has disagreed with the rest of the world: free trade agreements, global warming, the Israel-Palestine conflict, the treaty to eliminate land mines, the creation of an International Criminal Court, the war on Iraq and more. The author argues neither for nor against particular policies, but rather against the manner in which those policies are implemented. He explores the historical roots of unilateralism and shows how it shapes American foreign policy in many important areas: trade and economic policy, arms control, energy, environment, drug trafficking, & agriculture. He states that much of the international community regards the United States as a \\"rogue nation\\"‚Äîwhether they are in fact or not. Prestowitz notes, \\"Nations are very much like individuals. More than desire for material gain or fear or love, they are driven by a craving for dignity and respect, by the need to be recognized as valid and just as valuable as the next person or country.\\" He proposes that America's people and its leaders become better listeners. He interviewed an impressive number of foreign diplomats, ambassadors, and government officials, and he truthfully presents their views even when he does not concur. He provides historical context for various controversies. The book is described by several reviewers as informative and challenging.Multiple independent reviewers on Amazon Review of Rogue Nation on Spirituality and Practice website Review of Rogue Nation on Strategic Foresight website Publisher's comments Prestowitz, a former Reagan Administration trade official, is by no means anti-American.

The film also features Yuen Biao as one of the Master of the Five Fists. Chan was also the film's stunt co-ordinator. It was known in some releases as Karate Ghostbuster. Plot synopsis Yi-Lang (Jackie Chan) is a smart-alec martial arts student at a Shaolin Temple. An anonymous thief steals a book from the library which teaches a potentially fatal style of Kung Fu. Yi-Lang, along with a group of five other monks, is punished for not stopping the thief, but his bravery leads to him signing up to defend a supposedly haunted portion of the school. Upon discovering the ghosts, who are masters of a supposedly lost style of fighting known as The \\"Five Style Fists\\", Yi-Lang offers himself as a student, masters the form and uses it to progress quickly through the ranks of the school. In order to defend the school against the very thief who stole the book from its library, Yi-Lang demonstrates his new style and defeats the invading troupe, with a little help from his five spiritual masters.

As Lo Wei's studio was running out of money, they shelved both films due to cost-cutting measures and Chan was loaned out to Seasonal Films for a two-picture deal. Whilst there he made Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master with Yuen Woo-ping. The success of these two films at the domestic box office prompted Lo to give belated releases to Spiritual Kung Fu (late 1978) and Dragon Fist (1979). Spiritual Kung Fu was Lo Wei's response to Chan's earlier attempt at blending comedy with kung fu in the film Half a Loaf of Kung Fu. The supernatural elements of the film were brought to life by some early examples of Hong Kong special effects. Much of the scripted comedy in the film centred on Chan's exaggerated facial expressions and reactions to his ghostly teachers. The \\"Five Style Fists\\" kung fu style is based on the Five Fists (Animal) Pattern, one of the early Martial Arts practiced at the Shaolin Temple, as discussed in Qiu Yue Chan Shi's book \\"The Essence of the Five Fists\\". This system contains Dragon, Tiger, Snake, Crane and Leopard / Panther styles. Box office During its Hong Kong theatrical run, Spiritual Kung Fu grossed 2,397,558 (). Upon its 1982 release in South Korea, it sold 80,440 tickets in Seoul, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately (). Combined, the film grossed an estimated total of approximately in East Asia, equivalent to adjusted for inflation. Versions * The film was made with the intention of releasing in Mandarin in early 1978 but shelved. Prior to its belated theatrical release late that year, a Cantonese soundtrack and some small edits were made. It wasn't until 1980 that the film was finally given a release with the original Mandarin soundtrack. * Two Chinese versions of the film have surfaced to date.

Licensed to Naperville, Illinois, United States, the station serves the Chicago area. The station is currently owned by North Central College. History The station has been in operation since July 1, 1968, and currently broadcasts from studios in a renovated house at 232 E. Chicago Ave. in Naperville. Before 1997, WONC's studios were located on the fourth floor of the Old Main campus building at 30 N. Brainard St. The broadcast tower is located at 1805 High Grove Lane on the western edge of Naperville. On September 1, 1980, John V. Madormo succeeded Jon Yoder as the faculty advisor and general manager of WONC. Formerly a producer for Chicago's WGN radio, Madormo's experience led WONC to being recognized as one of the premier college radio stations in the country. The station won 20 Marconi awards during his tenure; no other college station won more. Over the years, WONC has been a participating station in the IBS (Intercollegiate Broadcasting System) awards and has won several awards.

The party also served as a send-off for Madormo, who went on to retire after the 2017-18 academic year, having spent 38 of WONC's 50 years as general manager. Madormo was succeeded by North Central/WONC alum Zachary DeWitz. Format The format has been album-oriented rock (commonly known within the radio business as AOR) since approximately 1987 and uses the slogan \\"Pure Rock FM 89.\\" From the station's inception to the 1980s, it was a more typical college free-form station. An adult contemporary format was aired for a time prior to the switch to the current format. The station provides coverage of North Central College's football games, men's and women's basketball games, and select home baseball and softball games. Each October, the station hosts the John Drury High School Radio Awards, honoring the legendary Chicago newscaster.

He was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia in 1787, the son of a Scottish immigrant. He attended the King's Collegiate School in Windsor and went to Quebec in 1805. He became an attorney in 1810 and served in the militia during the War of 1812. In 1816, he became the editor for the Quebec Telegraph, a weekly bilingual newspaper. In 1827, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada representing Gasp√© and was appointed chairman of the Court of Quarter Sessions. He came into conflict with the assembly for removing magistrates who opposed the governor and, in 1829, he was expelled from the Legislative Assembly. However, the constituents of Gasp√© continued to vote him back in and he was expelled four more times. The government in Britain supported Christie. Later, Christie attempted to start a movement in Gasp√© to separate from Lower Canada and join the province of New Brunswick. This alienated the voters of the region and he was not re-elected in 1833. In 1841, however, he was elected to the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada, again representing Gasp√©, and he continue to represent the region until 1854. He introduced the motion in 1842 to move the capital from Kingston to Montreal. He edited the newspaper Quebec Mercury from 1848 to 1850. Christie died at Quebec City in 1856, and was buried at Mount Hermon Cemetery in Sillery.

It is the second of three sequels to that company's The Mummy's Hand of 1940. The film is the sequel to The Mummy's Tomb (1942). Lon Chaney, Jr. again takes on the role of Kharis the mummy. The story was continued in the 1944 sequel The Mummy's Curse. Plot Lobby card featuring Ramsay Ames as Amina Andoheb, the aging High Priest of Arkam (Karnak in the previous films), has summoned Yousef Bey to the Temple of Arkam to pass on the duties of High Priest. Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile, in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, who had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his history class, who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs whenever the subject of Egypt is mentioned. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman, strangles him, and drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist. The next morning, the Sheriff and Coroner discover a strange mold around the dead professor's throat ‚Äì a sign they both know to mean that the mummy stalks Mapleton again. Sheriff Elwood questions Amina, who is dazed, but Tom Hervey arrives and tries to provide an alibi for her. The Sheriff finally dismisses the pair and Tom takes her home. Later, Yousef Bey, who has arrived in Mapleton, calls on Amon-Ra to aid him in his quest and begins to brew the sacred fluid of the tana leaves to summon Kharis. Kharis senses the leaves and heads toward them, murdering a helpless farmer along the way. The Sheriff soon arrives on the scene and organizes a search party. The next day, at the Scripps Museum, Yousef Bey lags behind a tour group viewing the mummy of Ananka. After closing time, Yousef emerges from a hiding place as Kharis breaks into the museum. Kharis attempts to touch the mummified body, but it disintegrates under the wrapping as his hand approaches. Yousef Bey realizes that Ananka's soul has been reincarnated into another form. Kharis is enraged and begins destroying the exhibit, attracting the museum security guard who is mercilessly slaughtered by Kharis. Police Inspector Walgreen and Dr. Ayad from the museum are bewildered as to how Ananka's body has disappeared without disturbing the wrappings. Dr. Ayad matches markings on the tomb to those on a cask of tana leaves and Inspector Walgreen decides to use the leaves to attract and capture Kharis. The plan is to build a pit to confine the creature until a way to deal with him can be found. Amina is still unable to shake the haunted feelings that torture her and Tom, disregarding the Sheriff's warnings, asks Amina to elope with him to New York. She agrees and the two make plans to leave early the next morning. Meanwhile, Yousef Bey calls upon Amon-Ra to lead him to the new home of Ananka's soul and then sends Kharis in that direction to find Ananka. Inspector Walgreen now begins to bait his trap by burning nine tana leaves and Kharis immediately heads toward the Norman home. Amina is awakened by his approach and hypnotically wanders into the yard. Kharis recognizes her as the carrier of Ananka's soul and Amina faints as Kharis picks her up and takes her away. The abduction is witnessed by Mrs. Blake, Amina's guardian, who phones Tom to alert him. Tom immediately sets out in pursuit while Mrs. Blake heads to the Norman house and tells her story to Inspector Walgreen, Sheriff Elwood and a large group of volunteers. Kharis arrives at the mill and presents Amina to Yousef Bey. Bey recognizes the birthmark on her wrist as the symbol of the priests of Arkam. Amina awakens and the priest informs her that she is, indeed, the reincarnation of Ananka. Yousef Bey now begins to admire Amina's beauty and cannot deny the temptations he feels to keep her alive as his bride. He decides to use the tana leaves to keep her young and beautiful forever, which enrages Kharis. Before Yousef Bey can give Amina the fluid, the mummy knocks the cup away and exacts his vengeance on the priest, who falls out a window to his death. Tom Hervey now arrives and witnesses the death of the Priest. He rushes up the stairs to the mill, but is met by Kharis. A struggle ensues and Tom is quickly overwhelmed. Kharis attempts to escape with Amina and the mob pursues the mummy and his princess into the nearby swamps. In Kharis‚Äô arms, Amina/Ananka is now aging rapidly. They are chased deeper and deeper into the swamps and now begin to sink into the bog. Tom's last anguished sight of Amina is that of a 3,000-year-old Egyptian princess as Kharis and Ananka disappear under the water, united at last in death.

In 1904, it was the fifth largest city in S√©n√©gal after Saint-Louis, Dakar, Rufisque and Gor√©e. It is also the capital of the Tijaniyya Sufi brotherhood. Each week, followers come to visit the tombs of religious leaders, especially that of El-Hadji Malick Sy. Visitors flock each year to celebrate the birth of the prophet Muhammad in a festival called the Maouloud (or Gamou, in Wolof, a word borrowed from one of the Serer religious festivals). The influence of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal helps to explain the dramatic demographic growth of the city, which had a population of less than 7900 in 1960.

It was written by Dave Louapre and illustrated by Vince Locke. Plot American Freak focused on a completely new set of characters of the Un-Men mythos created by Len Wein and Berni Wrightson, which were described as the offspring of the original Arcane Un- Men. The plot of American Freak revolves around the second-generation son of two of these \\"horribly disfigured creatures\\", a 23-year-old man named Damien Kane. Per this miniseries, the Army conducted painful, inhumane experiments on the captive Un-Men, toward the goal of ‚Äúmating‚Äù them and then producing a ‚Äúserum‚Äù to eliminate deformity in the offspring. (The military application of all this is not made clear.) The serum proved unstable and all the offspring except for Damien Kane died. Kane developed normally until he turned 23 years of age, at which time (the beginning of this miniseries) he began to horribly mutate. The story follows Kane‚Äôs painful transformation into a freak, and his escape (with the assistance of a telepathic, still-at-large-in-the-swamps first-generation Un-Man named Crassus ‚Äì note: this is not Cranius). Crassus tricks Kane into traveling with him to Romania, promising the lad that his ‚Äúcreator,‚Äù Arcane, might be able to help reverse the mutation. Of course, it‚Äôs a trick: Crassus knows that Arcane is no longer in his castle redoubt. Crassus‚Äôs secret goal is to make Kane rescue a gaggle of other next-generation Un-Men from the clutches of a depraved millionaire who forces them to perform in a private sideshow. Through some form of prophecy that is never explained, the next-generation Un-Men recognize Kane as ‚Äúthe One‚Äù they have long expected to deliver them from captivity. Kane reluctantly helps his cousins revolt and slaughter their tormentors. The Un-Men then board a private jet for America, where they proceed to set the captive, cryogenically frozen original Un-Men free. Army soldiers and guns are involved, and ultimately Kane‚Äôs love interest‚Äîa bald, legless and psychically powered second-generation Un-Woman named Scylla‚Äîis mowed down with bullets. The original Un-Men‚Äîmute and apparently retarded‚Äîtoss themselves into a conveniently situated vat of acid, thereby making a statement about the tragic pathos of freakdom. Meanwhile, Crassus vanishes into the darkness of the swamp. The military experiments are exposed, and Kane and his fellow survivors become celebrities, gracing the cover of LIFE magazine and appearing on TV talk shows. An embarrassed federal government grants them their own reservation settlement (on a former nuclear bomb testing site) and goth teens pay homage to the freaks at the camp perimeter. The Un-Men have become caged curiosities yet again. At the end of issue 5, Kane has mutated into a brooding endomorph, a veiny elder statesman narrating his tale from a private cave high above the new Un-Men encampment.

Biography  Roger Leloup was born in Verviers, Belgium in 1933.De Weyer, Geert (2005). \\"Roger Leloup\\". In Belgi√´ gestript, pp. 136‚Äì137. Tielt: Lannoo. Fascinated by trains and planes since his youth, he studied Decoration and Publicity at the Institut Saint-Luc in Li√®ge. By accident, he came into contact with the Franco-Belgian comics scene when his neighbour, Jacques Martin, told him that he desperately needed a colourist. Leloup got the job and started colouring the Alix album L'√Øle maudite in 1950. Jacques Martin was one of the main artists of the Franco- Belgian comics magazine Tintin, and when Herg√© was looking for someone to help him with the drawings of vehicles for a series, Martin brought him in contact with Leloup. From 15 February 1953 on, Leloup worked for several years at Studios Herg√©, where he drew detailed backgrounds and vehicles for Herg√©'s comics series The Adventures of Tintin. His work is seen in a wide variety of drawings, such as the Gen√®ve-Cointrin airport in The Calculus Affair and the impressive swing-wing supersonic business jet, the Carreidas 160 in Flight 714 to Sydney. Leloup worked for both Jacques Martin, with Alix and Lefranc, and for Herg√©, but as the production at the Studios Herg√© slowed down, and Leloup came into contact with other artists. He worked for a period with Francis, and also collaborated with Peyo on his less well-known series Jacky and C√©lestin. Here, he created a Japanese female character that would later become the inspiration for his own series. On 31 December 1969, Leloup left Studios Herg√© to work full-time on his own series, Yoko Tsuno, with a focus on technology and science fiction. The character Yoko Tsuno, a Japanese woman living in Brussels, is one of the leading examples of the female-fronted comics that appeared in the European juvenile magazines during this period. All Yoko Tsuno stories first appeared in Spirou magazine and later as an album series published by editions Dupuis. He has an adopted Korean daughter, who inspired him to draw the character Morning Dew, the little Chinese girl from Le Dragon de Hong Kong, who was adopted by Yoko Tsuno.

They were introduced in two batches. The first were in 1938, by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with a further batch (built to a similar design) in 1956 by the then nationalised British Railways (BR). When introduced by the LMS, they were officially known as Class AM3. They were designed for, and operated on, the Wirral & Mersey lines from Liverpool to West Kirby, New Brighton, and Rock Ferry. There were few places on their network of closely spaced stations to attain their maximum speed, except for the open section between Moreton and Meols. All but one set were withdrawn and scrapped by 1985. The final set was used on special Merseyrail services until 1988, and this preserved set was kept at the Electric Railway Museum near Coventry until moved to the Locomotive Storage Ltd warehouse at Margate. Overview A 1938 unit stands at the platform, next to two later 1956 units in the sidings, at West Kirby, in 1982. When introduced by the LMS, the class was officially known as Class AM3.This LMS classification scheme should not be confused with the Class 303 EMUs, which were also known as AM3 under the BR scheme, prior to the introduction of TOPS. The two batches were almost identical, a difference being that the 1938 stock had passenger door-open buttons mounted on the doorleaf itself, whereas on the 1956 the buttons were on the bodyside next to the door. Motor units could be identified from the driving trailers by the ventilation louvres in the bodyside near the car ends which led to ducting down to the motors. Originally, these trains featured a flat front. Emergency end doors were added, in 1972, as part of a Department of Transport directive for when working in a tunnel. The trains were fitted with four position marker lights on the front, which were used throughout their life as indicators to signalmen - both top lights for Rock Ferry, both right-hand lights for West Kirby, and one top light for New Brighton. When first introduced they were seen to be of a very advanced design for a mainline railway's suburban passenger trains, featuring things such as air-operated sliding doors which were opened and closed by the guard (hitherto trains either had \\"slam doors\\" or hand-operated sliding doors). Class 503 were the first group of electric trains on the main British railway system with air-operated power doors, located at the quarter points of each coach under the control of the guard, which became a later general standard. Builders They were not built in the LMS's own workshops, but by contractors in Birmingham, Metro Cammell of Saltley who built the motor coaches, and Birmingham RC&W; of Smethwick, which built the underframes. Both of whom had prior experience with building this type of train for the London Underground. Significant points of similarity can be seen between the Class 503 and the London Underground O and P stock, produced shortly beforehand by Birmingham RC&W.; The traction motors were supplied by British Thomson-Houston. Operation Between 1936 and 1938, the Wirral lines were modified and electrified using a 650 V DC third rail system. The new stock was used on the West Kirby line on weekdays, and the New Brighton and Rock Ferry lines on Sundays. including inter-running onto the Mersey Railway through to Liverpool, while the older Mersey Railway electric units were now used on the New Brighton route, during the week. After the 1956 stock was built, it was normal for the West Kirby route to be operated by the newer stock, and the New Brighton/Rock Ferry routes to be operated mostly by 1938 stock. When the Liverpool loop lines were opened, the stock became fully mixed on all routes. The units spent most of their working lives on the commuter routes between Liverpool and the Wirral; routes which latterly became known as the Wirral Line of Merseyrail. In 1977, three six-car trains were transferred to the Northern Line. They mainly worked the Kirkby to Garston service until 30 October 1981, and were then returned to the Wirral Line. Wartime destruction and replacements On the night of 12‚Äì13 March 1941 four of the 1938 cars, two trailers and two driving trailers, were destroyed by wartime bombing while standing at Birkenhead North in the same air raid which severely damaged Birkenhead Park station, and destroyed much else of Birkenhead and Wallasey. The two associated motor cars remained spare until the 1956 batch was built, when four replacement cars were added to the production. This accounts for the unbalanced number of cars produced in 1956. A known feature of the Ian Allan ABC rolling stock books for many years was that the destroyed cars continued to be listed, incorrectly, until well into the 1960s and after the replacements had been built. Interiors Loading gauge restrictions meant the class did not have the width, or length, which was possible with the Class 502 Liverpool to Southport sets introduced shortly afterwards, to a somewhat similar design. Seats in second class were 2+2, and in first class 2+1, and all seats aligned properly with the windows, which were generous arrangements for such short journeys. The Class 508 units introduced as their successors in 1985 were notably less attractive in these respects. The first class seats, which occupied most of the length of the trailer car, were retained unaltered when first class accommodation was discontinued, and from having been little used for much of the trains' lifetime became the most popular accommodation. Maintenance The main maintenance depot was at Birkenhead North, dedicated to the units. Careful attention allowed them to remain in good condition right up to their final withdrawal in 1985, unlike some other units elsewhere in the country at this time. Every four years, major overhauls, including full repaints, were conducted at Horwich Works, near Bolton. Along with other North-West EMUs, a set would be formed up at Birkenhead North with a match wagon and hauled by locomotive to Horwich. Until 1962, sets were hauled to Horwich via the West Kirby to Hooton Line and, later on, the route was via the Mid-Wirral Line. Formation A six-car set at Rock Ferry, in 1983. It was normal for the trains to operate as 6-car sets at peak times, reduced to 3-car sets off-peak. As all routes doubled their frequency at peak times as well, much of the stock spent a considerable amount of time out of service. There was no major stabling point on the system, various sidings dispersed around the network being used. For much of the trains' life, effort was put into deciding whether to leave the off-peak formations as 6-car on any day. For instance, during Christmas shopping weeks, or fine Summer Sundays, when the network used to handle much additional traffic from Liverpool and Birkenhead, to the seaside town termini of New Brighton and West Kirby. Numbering British Railways numbers were: * Driving Motor Brake Second (DMBS) ** M28672M-M28690M (19 cars 1938, Metro Cammell). ** M28371M-M28394M (24 cars 1956, Metro Cammell). * Trailer Second (TS) (Trailer Composite (TC) prior to mid-1970s) ** M29702M-M29720M (19 cars 1938, 29702-12 by Metro Cammell, 29713-20 by BRCW). 29708/17 destroyed 1941. ** M29821M-M29846M (26 cars 1956, 29821-30 by BRCW, 29833-46 by Metro Cammell). 29831-2 by BRCW as war replacements. * Driving Trailer Second (DTS) ** M29271M-M29289M (19 cars 1938, BRCW). 29277/86 destroyed 1941. ** M29131M-M29156M (26 cars 1956, 29131-54 by BRCW). 29155-6 by BRCW as war replacements. Livery The units were introduced with an all- over maroon livery by the LMS. From 1949 to 1956, the livery which BR applied was malachite green. Following this, BR green, with a yellow warning panel on the cab ends, was applied. By the early 1970s, the livery was all-over Rail Blue, with the cab ends repainted as full yellow. From the late 1970s, the livery became BR blue and grey, which the units carried until withdrawal. The preserved set was repainted in LMS all-over maroon, in 1985. Withdrawal and preservation =Withdrawal= A preserved signboard from the Class 503 farewell tour, at the Wirral Transport Museum, Birkenhead. Although the six BR manufacturer's plates remain on the board, the six LMS plates have been removed. The class was replaced by Classes 507 and 508. Although some had been withdrawn from June 1980 onwards, the majority of the Class 503s were progressively withdrawn from June 1984, the final service train running on 29 March 1985. This was followed by a farewell tour on 13 April 1985. Cars 28672, 29271 and 29702 had been used as a sandite unit on the Northern Line, after initial withdrawal in 1981. The departmental number of 977115 was allocated to car 29702 but never carried. This set was again withdrawn on 6 December 1984. DMBS car 28686 was gutted during a fire brigade exercise on 19 June 1983, before being left at Cavendish sidings. Some units were scrapped at Cavendish sidings on the Birkenhead Dock Branch line, whilst others were scrapped at the nearby Mollington Street depot. The remainder were scrapped at Alexandra Dock, BREL Horwich and also in Northwich, mainly under contract to Vic Berry, TW Ward and HP Cartwright. =Preservation= The preserved LMS Wirral and Mersey unit at the Electric Railway Museum, Coventry. A single set, formed of vehicles 28690, 29720 and 29289, was earmarked for preservation. Though never carried on the unit, the set was numbered under the BR TOPS code as 503 019. This was the last of the units built in 1938 to have been brought into service. The unit is also one of the only two pre-war main line EMUs in existence, which are still in original formation. The other being the 2-BIL belonging to the National Railway Museum. The set was kept in serviceable condition and operated occasional special trains on the Merseyrail network until 1988. During this period, the set was used for the opening of the electrified line between Rock Ferry and Hooton on 30 September 1985 and for special services during Christmas 1985. At the same time, Merseyrail decided not to preserve a second set, due to a lack of spares. Following this, the surviving set participated in the Merseyrail 100 celebration on 6 April 1986. The unit, named Ivor T. Davies G.M. on 14 March 1988, was purchased by Wirral Borough Council in 1991 and stored at Kirkdale until 1996. Two parts of the set were then sold and kept at Steamport, Southport. Meanwhile, the Driving Trailer coach (DTS) was kept at the Wirral Transport Museum. The two parts of the unit, which were sold, have been owned by the Suburban Electric Railway Association since purchase by its forerunner, the Mersey and Tyneside Electric Preservationists in 1996, and were stored at the Electric Railway Museum on the outskirts of Coventry. After transport of the Driving Trailer coach from Birkenhead, the entire unit was correctly reformed at the Coventry museum in October 2010, for the first time in over 20 years. The Driving Motor coach (DMBS) interior was open to the public during museum open days. In 2017, the Electric Railway Museum announced that it would be forced to close and relocate its collection. The Class 503 set was moved in May 2018, to the Locomotive Storage Ltd facility in the former Hornby Railways warehouse in Margate.

The film stars Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, Lola Forner, Benny Urquidez and Jos√© Sancho. The film was shot in Barcelona, Spain. The film was a box office success in East Asia. In Japan, the film was released as Spartan X. Jackie Chan with his stunt team were nominated for Best Action Choreography, for both Wheels on Meals and Project A, at the 4th Hong Kong Film Awards, winning the award for Project A. Wheels on Meals spawned the Spartan X franchise. In 1984, it was adapted into the early beat 'em up video game Spartan X (released as Kung-Fu Master internationally). There was also a sequel video game, Spartan X 2, and a Spartan X comic book series. The Spartan X franchise grossed an estimated total revenue of approximately worldwide. Plot Thomas and David are cousins who run a fast food van in Barcelona. The food is delivered by Thomas, who rushes around the square on a skateboard. After fending off a biker gang they continue business as normal. They pay a visit to David's father, who is in a mental institution, and bump into Sylvia, the daughter of David's father's girlfriend. Thomas encourages his cousin to try to ask her out on a date, but David chickens out of this, making the excuse she would have said no anyway. Later that night, while at the van serving food, Thomas inadvertently bumps into Sylvia, who is pretending to be a prostitute. She is actually a pickpocket, and she robs a man in a bedroom and runs away to their fast food van. Both Thomas and David are enamored by her, but after allowing her to stay in their apartment that night, they wake to find Sylvia and their money gone. The next day, they bump into Moby, a bumbling private investigator who is also tracking Sylvia. They later discover that Sylvia is the heir to a sizable inheritance that a criminal gang is trying to steal from her. When she is kidnapped, Thomas, David and Moby team up to save her, infiltrating the villains' castle and defeating them in a martial arts battle. The final scene of the film shows David, Thomas and Sylvia reunited. Sylvia asks for a summer job, and Moby asks David and Thomas if they wish to work as private detectives with him, which they refuse.

Superstitious Golden Harvest executives however demanded the title change because their two previous films with titles that began with the letter 'M' ‚Äì Megaforce and Menage A Trois ‚Äì were both box office flops. =Casting= The three action star brothers, Yuen, Chan and Hung, are long time best friends and had been Peking Opera School colleagues in their youth. The release of Wheels on Meals came in the midst of their most prolific period working together as a trio. The three men had acted together on Chan's Project A and the first of Hung's original Lucky Stars trilogy, Winners and Sinners in 1983. Wheels on Meals was released in 1984, and a year later they were reunited twice more for the Lucky Stars semi-sequels My Lucky Stars and Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars. This was something of a golden period for Hong Kong cinema-goers, as three of the nation's most beloved action stars performed together on screen. The film also features cameo appearances from fellow Lucky Stars Richard Ng and John Shum as mental patients in the hospital attended by the father of Yuen's character. Wheels on Meals was the first of two films which paired star Jackie Chan against former professional kickboxing champion Benny Urquidez (the other being the 1988 film Dragons Forever). Their fight in this film is typically regarded as one of the greatest on-screen martial arts fights ever performed. At one point in the final battle between the pair, a spin-kick performed by Urquidez is so quick that the resulting airflow extinguishes a row of candles. This is shown onscreen, with no cuts or trick photography. Co-star Lola Forner appeared in another Jackie Chan film, Armour of God (1987). =Filming= Audio commentator Bey Logan explains why Sammo Hung decided to shoot the film outside of Hong Kong. By the time it was made in 1984, shooting in Hong Kong had become practically impossible ‚Äì firstly, because the action stars had become so famous that they could not walk through the streets with impunity, and secondly due to the mounting difficulties in obtaining a permit from the government in order to film in Hong Kong. Bruce Lee had paved the way for Hong Kong filmmakers shooting abroad with the 1972 film Way of the Dragon, whose location filming was done in Italy, whereas the interiors had been shot at Golden Harvest studio. When Hung took his cast and crew to Barcelona, he wanted to strongly establish the locations in Barcelona as real, and to avoid shooting interiors at Golden Harvest. In comparison to Hong Kong, the Spanish authorities were very cooperative in allowing the use of locations for filming, even for car chases and fight scenes. Awards and nominations *1985 Hong Kong Film Awards: **Nominated: Best Action Choreography Box office During its Hong Kong theatrical run, Wheels on Meals grossed 21,465,013 (), becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of the year in Hong Kong. In Taiwan, where it ran during SeptemberOctober 1984, it became the third highest-grossing film of the year, earning (US$601,075). In Japan, where it released as Spartan X, it grossed (), becoming the sixth highest- grossing foreign film of 1985. In South Korea, it was the second highest- grossing film of 1985, with 307,751 box admissions in Seoul, equivalent to an estimated (). Combined, the film's total estimated box office gross in East Asia was approximately , equivalent to adjusted for inflation. Home release On 30 January 2006, DVD was released in a two disc platinum edition at Hong Kong Legends in UK in Region 2. Unlike the majority of Chan's later films, the standard DVD release of Wheels on Meals does not contain the usual outtakes over the final credits. However, a VHS release of the film did exist in the mid-1980s under the title Spartan X, which has the outtakes intact. Spartan X franchise =Video games= The arcade video game, Spartan X (the film's Japanese title), was developed by Irem in 1984. Originally inspired by the Bruce Lee film Game of Death (1972) during development, the final game was released as a tie-in in for Wheels on Meals in Japan. It was re-titled Kung-Fu Master for worldwide release without using the film's license. The arcade game laid the foundations for the beat 'em up genre of action video games, and inspired the 1988 French film Kung Fu Master. The game was ported to the Famicom/NES console in 1985 as Spartan X in Japan, and released as Kung Fu in Western markets. The Famicom/NES version sold 3.5million cartridges worldwide, including 1.42million in Japan and 2.08million overseas. At a retail price of , the game grossed an estimated () in Japan. Internationally, at a retail price of US$24.99, the game grossed an estimated overseas, bringing the game's estimated worldwide retail sales revenue to approximately . The game had two sequels. Vigilante was released for arcades in 1988. Spartan X 2 was released in Japan for the Famicom console in 1991. An image of Thomas, Chan's character in the film, was used in the title screen and cutscene of the 1995 unlicensed Super Famicom game Hong Kong 97 as the game's character, Chin, a fictional relative to Bruce Lee. =Comic books= Between 1997 and 1998, a series of Spartan X comic books were published. Three issues of Jackie Chan's Spartan X: The Armour of Heaven were published in 1997, and four issues of Jackie Chan's Spartan X: Hell Bent Hero For Hire were published in 1998.

The specific gravity of the liquid ingredients increases from top to bottom. Liqueurs with the most dissolved sugar and the least alcohol are densest and are put at the bottom. These include fruit juices and cream liqueurs. Those with the least water and the most alcohol, such as rum with 75% alcohol by volume, are floated on top. These drinks are made primarily for visual enjoyment rather than taste. They are sipped, sometimes through a silver straw, one liqueur at a time. The drink must be made and handled carefully to avoid mixing; however, some layered drinks, such as shooters, are generally drunk quickly.

The square of this side, 120, is a congruum: it is the difference between consecutive values in the arithmetic progression of squares 72, 132, 172. Equivalently, the two annuli between the three yellow circles have equal areas, times the congruum. In number theory, a congruum (plural congrua) is the difference between successive square numbers in an arithmetic progression of three squares. That is, if x2, y2, and z2 (for integers x, y, and z) are three square numbers that are equally spaced apart from each other, then the spacing between them, , is called a congruum. The congruum problem is the problem of finding squares in arithmetic progression and their associated congrua. It can be formalized as a Diophantine equation: find integers x, y, and z such that :y^2 - x^2 = z^2 - y^2. When this equation is satisfied, both sides of the equation equal the congruum. Fibonacci solved the congruum problem by finding a parameterized formula for generating all congrua, together with their associated arithmetic progressions. According to this formula, each congruum is four times the area of a Pythagorean triangle. Congrua are also closely connected with congruent numbers: every congruum is a congruent number, and every congruent number is a congruum multiplied by the square of a rational number.  Examples  As an example, the number 96 is a congruum because it is the difference between adjacent squares in the sequence 4, 100, and 196 (the squares of 2, 10, and 14 respectively). The first few congrua are: :24, 96, 120, 216, 240, 336, 384, 480, 600, 720 ‚Ä¶ .  History  The congruum problem was originally posed in 1225, as part of a mathematical tournament held by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, and answered correctly at that time by Fibonacci, who recorded his work on this problem in his Book of Squares.. Fibonacci was already aware that it is impossible for a congruum to itself be a square, but did not give a satisfactory proof of this fact.. Geometrically, this means that it is not possible for the pair of legs of a Pythagorean triangle to be the leg and hypotenuse of another Pythagorean triangle. A proof was eventually given by Pierre de Fermat, and the result is now known as Fermat's right triangle theorem. Fermat also conjectured, and Leonhard Euler proved, that there is no sequence of four squares in arithmetic progression..Euler's proof is not clearly written. An elementary proof is given in .  Parameterized solution  The congruum problem may be solved by choosing two distinct positive integers m and n (with m > n); then the number 4mn(m2 ‚àín2) is a congruum. The middle square of the associated arithmetic progression of squares is (m2 + n2)2, and the other two squares may be found by adding or subtracting the congruum. Additionally, multiplying a congruum by a square number produces another congruum, whose progression of squares is multiplied by the same factor. All solutions arise in one of these two ways.. For instance, the congruum 96 can be constructed by these formulas with m = 3 and n = 1, while the congruum 216 is obtained by multiplying the smaller congruum 24 by the square number 9. An equivalent formulation of this solution, given by Bernard Fr√©nicle de Bessy, is that for the three squares in arithmetic progression x2, y2, and z2, the middle number y is the hypotenuse of a Pythagorean triangle and the other two numbers x and z are the difference and sum respectively of the triangle's two legs.. The congruum itself is four times the area of the same Pythagorean triangle. The example of an arithmetic progression with the congruum 96 can be obtained in this way from a right triangle with side and hypotenuse lengths 6, 8, and 10.  Relation to congruent numbers  A congruent number is defined as the area of a right triangle with rational sides. Because every congruum can be obtained (using the parameterized solution) as the area of a Pythagorean triangle, it follows that every congruum is congruent. Conversely, every congruent number is a congruum multiplied by the square of a rational number.. However, testing whether a number is a congruum is much easier than testing whether a number is congruent. For the congruum problem, the parameterized solution reduces this testing problem to checking a finite set of parameter values. In contrast, for the congruent number problem, a finite testing procedure is known only conjecturally, via Tunnell's theorem, under the assumption that the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is true.

He served as the third Governor of Dakota Territory. Early life Faulk was born at Milford, Pike County, Pennsylvania, the son of John Faulk and his wife Margaret Heiner, a descendant of General Daniel Brodhead IV. Faulk moved with his family to Kittanning, Pennsylvania, where he was educated. He learned the printing trade and later edited the \\"Armstrong County Democrat.\\" He studied law and became involved with the Democratic party. Faulk served as county treasurer and then joined the Pennsylvania militia. Because of the slave issue, Faulk left the Democratic party to support John C. Fr√©mont in 1856 and Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Career Faulk was appointed chief clerk at the Yankton Agency in 1861 and worked for Dr. Walter A. Burleigh(son- in-law to A.J. Faulk). After the Santee uprising in 1862, he and his daughters returned to Pennsylvania. Dakota Territory Governor, Newton Edmunds assisted the investigation by a congressional committee of Walter Burleigh's corrupt behavior on the Yankton Reservation from 1861 to 1864; and, Burleigh responded by presenting charges against Governor Edmunds to President Andrew Johnson. Burleigh recommended that Edmunds be replaced by Andrew J. Faulk. In August 1866, President Johnson dismissed Newton Edmunds and appointed Faulk as Governor of Dakota Territory. After arriving at Yankton, Dakota Territory on September 3, 1866, Faulk relieved Edmunds of his duties and served as the interim Governor until officially assuming the office on March 16, 1867. Because of reports of pine timber and mineral wealth in the Black Hills, Faulk wanted to exclude that area from any future Indian reservation and to open it to white settlement. General William T. Sherman said that whites had no right to enter and occupy the Black Hills; since, the Indians had not ceded the area. In 1868, a group of entrepreneurs planned to invade the Black Hills without military protection. Officially, Governor Faulk said that he did not sanction this invasion; while, his rhetoric actually encouraged it. Because of his efforts to open the Black Hills to white settlement, Faulk was popular with entrepreneurs and adventurers in Dakota Territory. On May 10, 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant removed Faulk as governor and replaced him with John A. Burbank. Faulk remained in the Dakota Territory and went on to fill a vacancy in the mayor's office in Yankton in 1869 before becoming clerk of the United States District Court for Dakota Territory in 1873. When Governor Nehemiah Ordway attempted to remove the Dakota Territory capital from Yankton, Faulk worked to have Ordway dismissed. On April 19, 1877, Faulk participated in the meeting to adopt a statehood resolution; and in 1883, he attended the constitutional convention. Death Faulk continued to reside in Yankton, South Dakota, until the time of his death. He died on September 4, 1898, in Yankton, South Dakota.

Burbank Early life and career Burbank was born at Centerville, Wayne County, Indiana. After finishing school, he entered into the merchandising business with his father. In 1853, Burbank laid out the site of Falls City, Nebraska, and became the town's first mayor. He also served as postmaster and was a businessman in the community. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Burbank as agent for the Iowa and Sac Indian tribes in Missouri. After working in the office of the Governor of Indiana and then in the wholesale crockery business, Burbank moved to western Dakota Territory and assisted in the organization of Wyoming Territory. On May 10, 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Burbank as the Governor of Dakota Territory at a time when factions within the territory's Republicans were quarreling. When he took office, Burbank intended to make money in Dakota Territory through speculation and patronage. During his first year and a half in office, he became a member of the real estate firm, J. R. Hanson and Company. Because of his financial interests, Burbank neglected his duties as Governor and became unpopular as a result. He used his authority as Governor to abuse federal patronage to improve his own financial well being. In 1873, the Secretary of the Dakota Territory, Edwin S. McCook, took over as acting governor in Burbank's stead, but was assassinated in Yankton on September 11, 1873 by Peter P. Wintermute, a disgruntled constituent. Burbank managed to become reappointed as Governor with the help of his brother-in-law, Senator Oliver P. Morton. After a scandal involving the Dakota Southern Railroad, Governor Burbank finally resigned on January 1, 1874. Death After his departure from the office, he returned to Indiana and spent the rest of his life in the town of Richmond, dying on December 17, 1905 at age 78.

The Tors√•ker witch trials took place in 1675 in Tors√•ker parish in Sweden and were the largest witch trials in Swedish history. In a single day 71 people (65 women and 6 men) were beheaded and then burned. Laurentius Horn√¶us The trials began when Johannes Wattrangius of Tors√•ker parish told Laurentius Christophori Horn√¶us of Ytterl√§nn√§s parish to investigate witchcraft in his parish. Ytterl√§nn√§s and Tors√•ker were both in the Diocese of H√§rn√∂sand of the Lutheran Church of Sweden. Horn√¶us was zealous in his work ‚Äî by the time his task was complete, 71 people had been beheaded and burned. 65 of these were women, which was roughly one fifth of all women in the region.  Trial  The witch trial reached Tors√•ker as a result and a consequence of the great wave of witch hysteria known as stora ov√§sendet, which had begun to flourish over Sweden after the trial caused by Gertrud Svensdotter against M√§ret Jonsdotter in Dalarna in 1668. Sweden did not have separation of church and state, causing state-employed Lutheran priests to abide by government instructions. Lutherans called their ministers \\"priests\\" while in Sweden, and did not switch to the British term \\"minister\\" or \\"preacher\\" until in America in the late 1800s. The Lutheran clergy were ordered to use their sermons to inform their congregations of the crimes committed. Thus, the rumour of the witches spread over the country, where witch-hunts had earlier been a rarity. Horn√¶us was ordered to perform an investigation by order of the special commission which had been created to deal with the suddenly erupted witch panic. The priest had two boys stand at the door of the church to identify the witches by an invisible mark on their forehead as they went in. On one occasion, one of these boys pointed at the wife of the priest himself, Britta Rufina. People gasped, but she, as she told her grandson who wrote down the story then slapped the boy, and he quickly apologized when he saw who he had pointed at, and said he had been blinded by the sun. Horn√¶us was a priest with a terrifying reputation. The witnesses of the witch trial were mostly children, as the main accusations of the witches was that they had abducted children on the sabbath of Satan, and Horn√¶us had several methods to get them to give the testimony he wanted. He whipped them, he bathed children in the ice cold water of a hole in the ice in the lakes in winter, he put them in an oven, showed them fuel and pretended that he would light the fire in the oven and boil them. His grandson, J√∂ns Horn√¶us, who wrote down the story in 1735 after it was dictated by his grandmother, Laurentius Horn√¶us' wife Britta Rufina, was quoted as saying: \\"I remember some of these witnesses, who by these methods were in lack of health for the rest of their lives\\". He adds that children were still, sixty years afterwards, afraid to go near the house where his grandfather lived. On 15 October 1674, the witch trial of Tors√•ker opened. About one hundred people, of both sexes, were accused by the children. Even though this was the biggest witch trial in the country, the original documents of the trial provide little information of bad quality. The documents of 1674 simply summarize that the trial was very similar to the other trials and was very typical in every way, except for the uncommonly large number of victims. This would mean that the prisoners were accused of abducting children to the sabbath of Satan in Blockula. The best source for the trial is instead an account written by the grandson of the priest, J√∂ns Horn√¶us, who wrote down the story in 1735, sixty years afterwards, dictated by his grandmother, the priest's wife, Britta Rufina, who was an eyewitness to the trial and almost herself accused. About one hundred people were accused, but it is unclear how many were convicted and not executed. J√∂ns Horn√¶us claims many of those convicted escaped, and that some of the women were not executed because of pregnancy. The prisoners were kept in several different places in the village. They were given almost no food but were allowed to receive food from their relatives.  Execution  After the last sermon in the church of Tors√•ker, the prisoners, 71 people (65 women and 6 men) were led to the place of execution. J√∂ns Horn√¶us describes the execution in his book, where he wrote down the exact words of his grandmother, the eyewitness Britta Rufina, and she describes it like this, after a speech in the church: > Then they began to understand what would happen. Cries to heaven rose of > vengeance over those who caused their innocent deaths, but no cries and no > tears would help. Parents, men and brothers held a fence of pikes. (By which > she meant that the men of the village, the family members of the prisoners, > surrounded the prisoners with weapons) They were driven, seventy one of > them, of which only two could sing a psalm, which they repeated when they > walked as soon as it ended. Many fainted on the way out of weakness and > death wish, and those were carried by their families up until the place of > execution, which was in the middle in the parish, half a mile from all the > three churches, and called \\"The Mountain of the Stake.\\" On the mountain, the prisoners were decapitated away from the stakes, so as not to drown the wood in blood and make it hard to light, and when they were dead, their families took off their clothes and lifted their bodies on the stakes, which were lit and burned until they went out by themselves. The families of the executed then went home, according to Britta Rufina, without showing any emotions, as if they were completely numbed.  Aftermath  The Tors√•ker executions had, even at the time they occurred, dubious legitimacy. Neither the commission or any local courts had the rights to conduct any executions. They were expected to report their sentences to the higher court, which was to confirm them before the sentences could be carried out. The high court normally only confirmed a minority of the death sentences. In the case of Tors√•ker, the local court commission did not report the sentences to the high court, but executed the prisoners directly without confirmation of the sentences from their superiors, and the execution was therefore not lawful. The commission was also called from Tors√•ker to the capital to answer for their actions. They were defended by the local authorities in Tors√•ker, but there were to be no more executions in Tors√•ker. The witch-hunt in the country continued; after the Tors√•ker witch trial, it reached the capital, where it lasted until 1676 and ended with the execution of Malin Matsdotter in Stockholm, after which the authorities proved that the child witnesses were lying and it had been a mistake. In 1677, all the priests in the country were ordered to tell their congregations in the churches that the witches had now been expelled from the country forever to avoid further witch trials. In Tors√•ker, the boys who had pointed at the women at the church, the so-called \\"visgossarna\\" (the tale boys), were found with their throats cut.  Memorial stone  In 1975, a memorial stone was erected in Tors√•ker in honor of the victims of Tors√•ker witch trials.

After receiving his education, Ordway entered the mercantile and banking businesses. During Abraham Lincoln's bid for the Presidency in 1860, Ordway served as chairman in New Hampshire for the new Republican party. In 1862, he was appointed General Agent of the Post Office Department for the New England states. From 1863 until 1875, Ordway served as Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. He organized Center Market in Washington, DC and controlled it for the remainder of his life. From 1875 until 1880, Ordway served as state senator in New Hampshire. The New Hampshire congressional delegation nominated Nehemiah Ordway for the office of Governor of Dakota Territory. In May 1880, he was appointed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. Ordway was confirmed on June 1, 1880; he arrived in Yankton with his wife and son on June 23, 1880. Nehemiah G. Ordway, c. 1865 During his time as governor, Ordway made efforts to move the territorial capitol to Bismarck. This action angered political leaders in Yankton and Sioux Falls. Citizens of Yankton viewed Ordway as corrupt. On February 2, 1881, nine consecutive days of snowfall started in Dakota Territory, resulting in food and fuel shortages. Governor Ordway sought Army and Indian supplies until private donations could be obtained. Eventually, he obtained $7000 in cash contributions as well as six tons of relief supplies. According to records, Governor Ordway engaged in a number of questionable dealings. In May 1881, Richard F. Pettigrew filed charges against Governor Ordway, insisting on his removal from office. On June 2, 1883, Ordway successfully moved the capital of Dakota Territory from Yankton to Bismarck with the assistance of Alexander McKenzie, an agent for the Northern Pacific Railway. In the fall of 1883, representatives of southern counties made further efforts to remove Ordway from office. He was indicted for corruption and President Chester A. Arthur replaced him with Gilbert A. Pierce in 1884. After leaving office, Ordway remained in Bismarck for a number of years because of investments. He lobbied for the Northern Pacific Railway and fought against separate statehood for the southern counties. During the 1890s, Ordway returned to New Hampshire, where he managed two large farms and spent the rest of his life. Nehemiah G. Ordway is the namesake of the community of Ordway, South Dakota.

The player wins if two of their numbers, on a given ticket, are among the random ones. The problem of how many tickets the player must buy in order to be certain of winning can be solved by the use of the Fano plane. The solution is to buy a total of 14 tickets, in two sets of seven. One set of seven is every line of a Fano plane with the numbers 1-7, the other with 8-14, i.e.: 1-2-5, 1-3-6, 1-4-7, 2-3-7, 2-4-6, 3-4-5, 5-6-7, 8-9-12, 8-10-13, 8-11-14, 9-10-14, 9-11-13, 10-11-12, 12-13-14. Because at least two of the winning numbers must be either high (8-14) or low (1-7), and every high and low pair is represented by exactly one ticket, you would be guaranteed at least two correct numbers on one ticket with these 14 purchases. 21/26 of the time you will have one ticket with two numbers matched. If all three winning numbers are either high or low you would either have one ticket with all three numbers (1/26 chance of this occurring), or three different tickets that each matched two (4/26 chance).

Pierce Pierce County, North Dakota was named in his honor. Biography Gilbert Pierce was born at East Otto, Cattaraugus County, New York. He and his parents moved to Indiana. Pierce attended the University of Chicago; where he studied writing, literature, and law. He enlisted in the ninth Indiana Volunteers as a second lieutenant in 1861. By 1864, Pierce was a colonel and an inspector general of the War Department. In 1868, he became a member of the Indiana House of Representatives. From 1868 to 1871, Pierce was a journal clerk of the United States Senate. After resigning, he edited a Republican Chicago newspaper called the \\"Inter Ocean\\" as well as wrote a number of plays, novels, and sketches. In 1877, Pierce became managing editor of the \\"Inter Ocean\\" before assuming a similar position for the \\"Chicago News.\\" On June 25, 1884 Gilbert Pierce was appointed Governor of Dakota Territory by President Chester A. Arthur. Because of the corruption of his predecessor, Governor Pierce's appointment was treated with suspicion by residents of Dakota Territory. Because of bad feelings over the moving of the territorial capital, Pierce chose to be sworn in at the former capital city of Yankton on July 25, 1884 before assuming office at the new capital of Bismarck. With time, the new Governor gained respect in the territory. Governor Pierce vetoed a bill to move the capital from Bismarck to Pierre. He and the legislature did agree to establish the School of Mines at Rapid City. Pierce vetoed a bill to grant equal suffrage to women. He was a proponent of statehood and quickly signed a bill into law to authorize a state constitutional convention for southern Dakota Territory. In August 1886, Governor Pierce resigned but remained in office until February 5, 1887. After leaving office, he served in Bismarck as a correspondent for newspapers in St. Paul, Minnesota. After North Dakota became a state in 1889, Pierce was elected to one term as United States Senator. In 1891, he purchased a half interest in the Minneapolis Tribune before selling it to become business manager of the Chicago Post and Times-Herald. In 1893, Pierce was appointed U.S. Minister to Portugal by President Benjamin Harrison; but failing health forced Pierce to resign after only a few months.

Church was born in Brooklyn, New York. He was educated at the Hudson River Institute at Claverack, New York. After studying law at the office of Judge N. B. Moore, Church was admitted to the bar. He practiced law with Judge Moore until eventually practicing by himself in 1874. Church was a member of the New York State Assembly (Queens Co., 1st D.) in 1883, 1884 and 1885.'The Argus Almanac A Political and Financial Annual,' 1880: pg 100 Then, President Cleveland appointed Church as judge in the Third District of Dakota Territory. Because of Church's good reputation as a judge, President Cleveland appointed Louis Church as Governor of Dakota Territory. A number of Democrats in Dakota Territory were disappointed in the appointment because they had expected the appointment of Dakota resident Frank M. Ziebach. Church became governor on February 21, 1887. He scrutinized every bill and restrained excessive spending with his veto power. He allowed the reform school to be established at Plankinton. Church opposed the division of Dakota Territory into two separate states. Governor Church and former Governors, Nehemiah G. Ordway and John L. Pennington, wanted Dakota to enter the Union as a single state. In spite of his integrity, Church became very unpopular as governor because of his opposition to separate statehood. When Benjamin Harrison defeated Cleveland as president, Church became a lame duck who was generally ignored by the territorial legislature. On March 4, 1889, Harrison was inaugurated as president, and Church resigned as governor on March 9, 1889. After leaving office, Louis Church returned to practicing law, first in Huron and then in Everett, Washington. During a trip to Alaska in 1897, Church died after developing pneumonia.

Their name \\"Pillagers\\" is a translation of , which literally means \\"Pillaging Men\\". The French called them , also a translation of their name. The French and Americans adopted their autonym for their military activities as the advance guard of the Ojibwe in the invasion of the Dakota country. They settled first on Leech Lake and gradually pushed westward from that point.

These included the following: * Northern Bands ** Red Cedar (Cass) Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (' - \\"where there are many red cedar\\")1 ** Turtle Portage Band of Chippewa Indians, located about Turtle River and Turtle Lake, between Leech Lake and Red Lake.2 ** Lake Winnibigoshish Band of Chippewa Indians (') * Eastern Bands ** Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe (') *** Bear Island (on Leech Lake) *** Boy Lake *** Pine Point (on Leech Lake) ** Pillager (') *** Upper Crow Wing River (', literally ‚Ä≥Raven's Wing River Men‚Ä≥) *** Wing River * Western Bands ** Otter Tail Lake Band of Chippewa Indians ** Otter Tail River :1 There also was a similarly named different Red Cedar Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa who was amalgamated with the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians. :2 There also was a similarly named different Turtle Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa who was amalgamated with the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. =Unification= Through the treaty process with the United States, the Pillager Band were settled on reservations in north-central Minnesota. A majority were placed on the following three reservations, established under the 1855 Treaty of Washington : * Cass Lake Reservation * Lake Winnibigoshish Reservation * Leech Lake Reservation Through additional treaties with the United States, the Leech Lake and Lake Winnibigoshish reservations were nearly doubled in size in the late nineteenth century. When the White Earth Reservation was created in 1867, the western Pillagers living about Otter Tail Lake agreed to relocate to that reservation so they would no longer be landless. In 1934, the Cass Lake, Lake Winnibigoshish and Leech Lake Pillagers, together with the White Oak Point Reservation of the Mississippi Chippewa and the Removable Lake Superior Chippewa Bands of the Chippewa Reservation, agreed to a merger and re-organization. Together, these central Minnesota peoples formed today's Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, consolidated chiefly on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. The successors apparent of the Pillagers are: * Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe * White Earth Band of Chippewa In turn, that year the Leech Lake and White Earth bands participated in writing a constitution for a new tribal government.

The company was subsequently floated on the Australian Stock Exchange. On Christmas Eve, 1993, the firm's sole asset, the printing plant, was destroyed by fire. It had been insured at replacement value (A$53.2 million), more than three times its purchase price, and the share price skyrocketed. The fire was blamed on a staff barbecue, but suspicions of arson have persisted. Known investors included: * Rene Rivkin, a Sydney stockbroker and entrepreneur * Graham Richardson, a former Labor Senator and associate of Kerry Packer * Eddie Obeid, a Labor politician * Trevor Kennedy, a businessman and former Packer executive * Rodney Adler, an entrepreneur * Sean Howard, a businessman and one of the founders of internet company OzEmail * Bill Hayden, a former Labor leader and Governor-General of Australia * Ray Martin, a television personality who appeared on the Packers' Nine Network The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) commenced an investigation into the ownership of a 38% stake in the company via secret Swiss bank accounts. Rivkin denied any knowledge of the ownership of the stake at the time, but in 2003 ASIC discovered that he himself, in partnership with Richardson and Kennedy, had been using Swiss bank accounts to trade in Offset Alpine and other companies. Rivkin committed suicide in 2005, before the investigation was completed, after being jailed on an unrelated insider trading matter. In January 2006 after a two-year legal battle, ASIC gained access to the relevant Swiss banking records. In September 2006 it was revealed that Richardson had almost $1.5 million in Swiss accounts which he had failed to declare to the Australian Tax Office. In 2010 ASIC discontinued its investigation.

It is home to the University of Detroit Mercy Titans basketball team. The arena opened in 1952. The building was dedicated on May 25, 1952 as the Memorial Building. The first basketball game was played on December 2 of that year when the Titans defeated Kalamazoo College, 75‚Äì61. In 1977, the name was changed to Calihan Hall in honor of Bob Calihan, the Titans' first basketball All- American who went on to become the school's winningest coach. The National Basketball Association (NBA) Detroit Pistons played some games in Calihan Hall in the late 1950s. The Titan Pep Band is featured at all men's and women's home basketball games in Calihan Hall. Capacity at Calihan Hall was listed at over 10,000 in the 1960s and 70s, and standing-room admissions allowed attendance in excess of that figure; since then, limitations ordered by fire marshals and other safety personnel have reduced capacity to the current figure of 7,917. Detroit Catholic High School League (CHSL) playoff games are regularly held at Calihan Hall, which has also hosted numerous Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) tournament games. The University of Michigan hosted the championship game of the 2017 Women's National Invitation Tournament at Calihan Hall due to the unavailability of the Crisler Center, its on-campus home. The Wolverines defeated Georgia Tech 89-79 in three overtimes. On December 5, 2011, the playing surface was named Dick Vitale Court in honor of longtime ESPN analyst Dick Vitale, who began his head coaching career at the University of Detroit in 1973 and later served as the school's athletic director.

As the FIA had announced rule changes for Group 6 Prototype- Sports Cars limiting engine displacement to 3000 cc, as in Formula One, Porsche designed the 908 as the first Porsche sports car to have an engine with the maximum size allowed. The previous Porsche 907 only had a 2200 cc Type 771/1 flat-8 engine developing 270 hp. The new 3-litre Type 908 flat-8 engine produced 257 kW (350 hp) at 8400 rpm. Being traditionally air-cooled and with only 2 valves per cylinder, it was still down on power compared to more modern F1 designs which delivered over , but were not suited to endurance racing. The 908 originally was a closed coupe to provide low drag at fast tracks, but from 1969 on was mainly raced as the 908/2, a lighter open spyder. A more compact 908/3 was introduced in 1970 to complement the heavy Porsche 917 on twisty tracks that favored nimble cars, like Targa Florio and N√ºrburgring. Sold off to privateers for 1972, various 908s were entered until the early 1980s, often retro-fitted with Porsche 934-based 2.1-litre turbocharged flat 6 engines.  1968: 908/01  Despite winning the 1000km N√ºrburgring, the 908 was anything but convincing in 1968. The older and smaller 2200 cc 907 had started the season with dominating wins and later delivered better results than Porsche's first serious attempt in the prototype category. Meanwhile, the older 4.7-litre Ford GT40s Group 5 Sports Cars were winning races on the faster tracks, with the Ford P68 being a failure, Ferrari remaining absent, and the Alfa Romeo 33 still utilizing a 2000cc engine. With the minimum production requirement for the 5000cc Group 5 Sports Car category reduced from 50 units to 25 for 1969, Porsche decided to go one step further and build the required 25 examples of a new 12-cylinder car, the Porsche 917. This risky investment should take about a year, though, and the 908 was supposed to deliver results in the meantime. The 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans were postponed from June to the end of September due to political unrest in France, setting the stage for a showdown between the 908s and the GT40s. The Porsche 908 LH Long Tails were the fastest in qualifying and the early stages of the race, but it showed that Porsche had not taken advantage of the additional time to improve the 908. Troubles with the alternator caused delays and even disqualifications as the new Porsche team leaders had misinterpreted the repair rules. Once again, a V8-powered Ford won, and a 907 Long Tail came in second in front of the sole surviving standard 908. In addition, Ford won the 1968 International Championship for Makes.  1969: 908/02  Le Mans 1969, shown at the N√ºrburgring in 1981 Porsche 908/02 of 1969 For 1969, the Group 6 prototype rules were changed, and Porsche lowered the weight of the Porsche 908/02 Spyder by , removing the roof and the long tails. Aluminium tube frames were used, with air pressure gauges to check them. The 1969 24 Hours of Daytona were a disaster for Porsche, as all three 908/02 failed, and a Lola T70 won. At the 12 Hours of Sebring, a Ford GT40 defeated a trio of factory- entered 908/2s. At that time, the more powerful Porsche 917 was introduced in Geneva, and it seemed that the career of the 908 would be over. But with the larger car having arrived, the 908 started to succeed. The next race was the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch, where the 908 was finally successful, finishing 1-2-3 ahead of a Ferrari 312P. With additional wins at the 1000km Monza, the Targa Florio, the 1000km Spa and an overwhelming 1-2-3-4-5 at the 1000 km N√ºrburgring, the 1969 International Championship for Makes was secured for Porsche by the 908/02, while the Porsche 917 suffered teething problems. On the other hand, the prestigious 24 hours of Le Mans was again won by a Ford GT40 in 1969, as the 917s had gearbox troubles after leading for many hours. A 908 challenged for the win, as Hans Herrmann came in as a very close 2nd behind Jacky Ickx. Herrmann's 908 low drag coup√© was fast on the straights, but near the race end the brake pads wore down, indicated by a light that was introduced with the 908s. The team gambled on not changing the pads, which allowed Ickx to pass under braking.  1970 - 1971: 908/03 Porsche 908/03 in 1970 (Hans Herrmann) Porsche 908/03 of 1971, with fins (Jo Siffert) Despite the more powerful 917 improving towards the end of 1969, the career of the 908 would continue. On rather twisty and slow tracks like N√ºrburgring and Targa Florio, the 917 was not suited well even after being modified to the \\"917K\\". So rather than trying to make \\"one size fit all\\", Porsche built dedicated cars for each type of racing track. Based upon the lightweight and short Porsche 909 which was used in hillclimbing, the new open cockpit version, the 908/03, was even shorter than the 908/02, and only weighed 500 kg (1,100 lb)- an astonishing figure for a long-distance racing car- in comparison, the 917K weighed about 840 kg (1,900 lb). This version was successful in the 1970 Nurburgring 1000 km and the Targa Florio, where typical speeds were only about half of the which the 917LH long tails could achieve at Le Mans. The 908/02 in which Steve McQueen finished second at the 1970 12 Hours of Sebring was also used as a camera car for the Le Mans (film) in the race itself. Steve McQueen originally intended to drive a Porsche 917 in the race, though this was vetoed by the studio funding the film. In 1971, vertical fins were added to the rear of the 908s which were outpaced at the Targa by two Alfa Romeo Tipo 33s. All entered 908s crashed (2 on the first lap; Brian Redman was badly injured after crashing 20 miles into his first lap), but Vic Elford had managed to set fastest lap. The next race at the Nurburgring saw a 1-2-3 finish for the 908 in front of two Alfas, but with Alfa scoring wins at Brands Hatch and Watkins Glen, it was proven that these prototypes could even beat the 917s. With the combination of the powerful 917 and the lightweight 908, Porsche dominated the International Championship for Makes each year from 1969 through to 1971.  1972 - 1981  Porsche 908/03, privately entered in 1973 Porsche 908.3 turbo of 1980, with airbox for the intercooler For 1972, the 5000 cc Group 5 Sports Car category was discontinued, and the 917 and its main rival, the Ferrari 512, became obsolete. In the 3000cc category, now renamed Group 5 Sports Cars, Porsche's main advantage was their low weight, as the engine was underpowered with . The new rules required a much higher weight () than Porsche could achieve (well under ), giving the advantage to Ferrari 312PB, Alfa Romeo T33TT and Matra with their more powerful F1-derived engines that had or more even in endurance trim. Porsche decided to end its 20-year history of factory sports car racing and sold the 908/03 cars to customers. Besides developing the 917/10 turbo for the Can Am series, the Zuffenhausen-based company focused on the development of the already aging Porsche 911, testing the 911 flat-6 with turbochargers. Yet a 3 year old Porsche 908LH Coup√© was entered by Reinhold Joest in the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing a strong 3rd. Customers continued to race several 908/3, fitted with extra weight as required by the rules. In 1975, some 908s were fitted with turbocharged engines, similar to those used in the Porsche 934 GT car. Even with 2.1-litre and a turbo factor of 1.4, the turbos by now outpowered normally aspirated 3-litre engines. Taking advantage of that, in 1976 the factory developed the Porsche 936 to compete in the new Group 6 Two-Seater Racing Car category that replaced the Group 5 Sports Car class. Unlike the 934 and 935, Porsche did not offer the 936 for sale, entering it in a few races only, mostly at Le Mans. Several customer-908s were upgraded with 936-style bodywork. The Porsche 908/80 Turbo of Joest and Jacky Ickx which finished 2nd in the 1980 24 Hours of Le Mans turned out later to have a real Porsche 936 chassis, though. The 908 has won the 1000km N√ºrburgring in three different decades, winning four years in a row from 1968 to 1971 and again in 1980, utilizing turbocharging for its final victory. 908s are still raced today in competitions such as the Classic Endurance Racing (CER) series.

It is home to the Youngstown State University Penguins basketball, volleyball, and swimming teams. The first event at the arena was a basketball game against the Ohio University Bobcats, which ended in a 68-59 Youngstown State victory. The arena, which originally seated 6,000, has undergone many changes since its opening. The Youngstown State women's basketball team moved into the arena in the mid-1970s. In 1983, permanent seats at both ends of the court and 1,260 chairback seats at mid-court were added. On September 15, 1996, YSU dedicated Veterans' Plaza directly in front of Beeghly Center. This $500,000 community project was funded in-part through private donations to honor all United States Veterans. In 2000, the court was repainted, two additional scoreboards were added and expanded press-row seating was created. In May 2002, the facility underwent more than $2.5 million in additional renovations, including a new front and rear lobby, new hallways and locker rooms and a new $150,000 sound system. The multipurpose facility includes an Olympic-sized swimming and diving facility, racquetball and squash courts, classrooms, and administrative offices. Beeghly is also home to the men's and women's basketball offices as well as the Olympic sports offices. In addition to YSU intercollegiate basketball and volleyball contests, as well as university events, Beeghly Center has served as the site for high school competitions, World Wrestling Entertainment matches (though the WWE now uses the newer Covelli Centre nearby when visiting Youngstown), concerts, tradeshows, and numerous other functions that dot the busy facility schedule throughout the year.

SIGMO stands for Synthetic, IntelliGent, MObility, and was developed by a team of high school students to demonstrate the capabilities of passive-dynamic actuation techniques. The technology used to enable SIGMO to walk is being applied to advanced prosthetic devices. Current prosthetic devices are nearing the limitations of the available technologies and require advancements such as customized motion, lower cost, and the development of light-weight materials. Existing humanoid robot systems such as ASIMO and QRIO use many motors to achieve locomotion. These motors reduce efficiency and add unnecessary weight and cost to the robot. SIGMO attempts to alleviate these symptoms by providing a system which uses no motors for locomotion, instead employing passive-dynamic technology. Passive-dynamic systems cite low power consumption, high durability, and low cost. The design is based on the skeletal structure of the human body, consisting of two legs with hip, knee, and ankle joints, each representing 1 degree of freedom (DOF). Movement is accomplished with the aid of gravity (walking down a slope) or by minimal actuation to enable the machine to walk on level ground. SIGMO was developed using proven methods of gravity-driven passive dynamic bipeds. Small actuators were added to the legs to provide walking capability on level ground. This method of locomotion is very energy efficient because it uses no motors for walking. The omission of motors also cites a drastic weight reduction, further enhancing the locomotive efficiency. This also frees up room inside the torso for the circuitry that controls SIGMO's movements, unlike other robots that require a \\"backpack\\" like attachment. SIGMO has an upper torso which mimics the movements of actual humans. The arms are motorized with small servo motors which enable SIGMO to manipulate objects within its grasp. The main chassis is fabricated of aluminum sheet metal, which has a high strength and light weight. The knee sockets are fabricated out of steel and aluminum. While the steel weighs more than the aluminum, this helps to transfer the weight load from the torso (contains heavy servo components) to the legs and feet which rest on the ground. An updated model of SIGMO, currently in the research and development stage, will incorporate more precise control over limb movement and directional stability. To add more functionality SIGMO will have more motors, but use each more efficiently than previous designs. Knowledge of actuation techniques gained from previous experiments will be applied to reduce complexity and maintain an efficient method of locomotion. A framework is in development to allow multiple configurations of the robot to lower production costs over time and increase flexibility of design during testing. The robust internal skeleton will be modifiable to serve as a platform for future designs. Intelligent maneuvering will also be tested with the new prototype to develop efficient algorithms and control models for both simple and complex environments.

Running for about in a general north-south direction, connecting rural portions of Ripley and Franklin counties. SR 229 was originally introduced in the early 1930 routed between Batesville and U.S. Route 52 (US 52) as part of SR 1. That section SR 1 became SR 229 a year later. In the late 1960s the road was paved. Route description The southern terminus of SR 229 is in downtown Napoleon, at the corner of Madison Street (US 421) and Main Street. SR 229 leads east from the intersection before turning southeast to head out of town. The road turns north-northeast at an T-intersection with the western end of SR 48. The highway heads towards Batesville as a rural curvy two-lane highway, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland. On the way to Batesville the road passes through the unincorporated community of Ballstown. SR 229 enters Batesville passing through Brums Woods, before turning due north onto Mulberry Street. SR 229 crosses a Central Railroad of Indiana tack, before curving onto Main Street. Main Street heads northeast entering downtown Batesville. SR 229 leaves Main Street and follows Boehringer Street northwest for one block, before turning northeast onto Walnut Street. Walnut Street leaves downtown by passing the Batesville Public Library. Northeast of downtown the state road passes through an intersection with SR 46. After SR 46, the road enters a commercial district and has an interchange with Interstate 74 (I‚Äì74). SR 229 continues through the commercial district until the road curves toward the north and leaves Batesville. North of Batesville the road passes many house before entering Oldenburg following Sycamore Street. SR 229 turns east onto Main Street passing through the historic district of Oldenburg. After the historical area SR 229 turns due north and Main Street ends. The highway continues north and leaves town. After Oldenburg SR 229 turns towards the east for a short distance, before curving back towards the north. The road passes through the unincorporated community of Peppertown. North of Peppertown SR 229 becomes curvy, some of which are very sharp. SR 229 ends at a T-intersection with US 52 in rural Franklin County, just west of the Whitewater River and the census- designated place of Metamora. No part of SR 229 is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highest traffic count is between SR 46 and I‚Äì74, where 24,559 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. The lowest traffic count is immediately north of SR 48, where 423 vehicles travel the highway on average each day.  History  In 1930, the Indiana State Highway Commission designated SR 1 along the modern routing of SR 229, between Batesville and US 52. SR 229 had its beginning in 1931 when it was designated from Napoleon to US 52, replacing SR 1 from Batesville to US 52. An interchange with I-74 was opened between 1963 and 1964. The entire roadway was paved between 1966 and 1967.

The home venue of the Pacific Tigers was constructed in 1950 for football and later hosted women's soccer; it was closed in 2012 and demolished two years later. Construction Pacific Memorial Stadium was built in 1950 after the successful fund drive which netted $165,000. Most of this money was through the sale of pre-ordered tickets (scrip), which were usable over a 10-year period. Construction began on the earth-filled structure in May 1950. Astonishingly, it was finished on time for the home opener (fifth game of the season) on October 21, a build time of less than six months. The field's approximate alignment was north-northwest to south-southeast. The stadium originally seated 35,975 with room for expansion to over 44,000, but renovations reduced the capacity to a configuration of 28,000. It was the venue for a 1997 friendly soccer match between Brazil and Honduras; notable striker Ronaldo scored six goals and Brazil won 8‚Äì2. Upgrades The Pacific Club, which was added to the east-side of the stadium in 1973, was donated by Alex Spanos at a cost of $250,000. It sat up to 300, featuring glass walls and a great view of the stadium. When not in use for sporting events, it also held many university functions and gatherings. The scoreboard in the north end zone was erected in 1982 at a cost of $140,000 and measured . Thanks to donations from athletic boosters, lighting power at the stadium was upgraded from 35 to 75 footcandles in August 1986. Renaming Pacific Memorial Stadium was officially renamed Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium on October 15, 1988, to honor Amos Alonzo Stagg (1862‚Äì1965). He ended his head coaching career at \\"College of the Pacific\\" in 1946, and donated the land for the stadium to be built in 1950. Stagg is widely regarded as a pioneer in the development of sports, not only football but also basketball and baseball. Closure On February 26, 2012, the university announced it would close Stagg Memorial Stadium to conduct a feasibility study to assess needed repairs, upgrades and changes required to make the facility meet modern standards in conjunction with a financial assessment to determine if the stadium could be repaired or if it should be replaced. Demolition The university began removal of Stagg Memorial Stadium on February 24, 2014, to make room for new athletics facilities, including a dedicated tennis center with 12 courts and a clubhouse, and new fields for soccer and field hockey. The first Pacific field hockey home game on the new turf field at University of the Pacific was played on September 12, 2014 versus the University of Albany. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Eve Zimmerman Tennis Center was held on October 17, 2014. Tenants The stadium was home to the Pacific Tigers football program, beginning in 1950, until it was discontinued following the 1995 season. For many years it was also the home football field for nearby Stagg High School. The stadium was the sole home to the women's soccer team until its closure in 2012.

Birth and education He was born as Lars Christoffersson in H√§rn√∂sand in 1645. During the 17th century in Sweden, the Latinized form of peoples names were common and their birthplace was sometimes added as a family name. Hornaeus most likely is the Latinized version of H√§rn√∂sand. Lars started his theological studies in the 1660s and in 1667 he and his brother Petrus were both studying together at the University of Uppsala. Lars was ordained in 1672 and was then employed as an assistant or curate, to the \\"assistant minister\\" Olaus Erici Rufinius (1637-1672) in Ytterl√§nn√§s. Ytterl√§nn√§s is the parish for the city of Tors√•ker. He was also responsible for the annex parish in the Dal Hundred. Olaus Rufinius died in 1672, and Lars was appointed as the new \\"assistant minister\\" of Ytterl√§nn√§s. Tors√•ker witch trials In 1675 Laurentius Christophri Hornaeus engaged in the Tors√•ker witch trials, which became the largest witch-hunt in Sweden's history. Konservera pr√§st√§nkan It was traditional that when a minister died, the clergyman who replaced him would marry his widow, or his daughter, depending on their age. This was termed \\"preserve the minister‚Äôs widow\\" (konservera pr√§st√§nkan). Olaus Rufinius was already a widower when he died, and he had an unmarried daughter named Brita Olofsdotter Rufinia (1651-1730). Lars married Brita, and the wedding took place in the parsonage in Sunnan√•ker, in Ytterl√§nn√§s parish. Lars and Brita had a child: Lars Hornaeus (1682-1751) a minister, who would marry Elisabeth Wattrangia (1682-1743). Lars and Elizabeth would have a son: J√∂ns Hornaeus (1715-1778), a minister who documented the witch trials of his grandfather. Death Laurentius died on April 27, 1719 in Nordan√•ker, Ytterl√§nn√§s parish. He was buried under the old church in Ytterl√§nn√§s where a hatch in the floor between the altar and the door to the sacristy leads to his still preserved grave. Lars Larsson Hornaeus took over his father's pastorate in 1719 and led the congregation until his death in 1751.

Plot  In the 1930s in the United States,a sect composed of rich and eccentric libertines who reject any idea of love, considered artistic creation as a form of evil and tried to find in total sexual freedom the ecstasy of pure being. Following a conference that they called in New York in 1937, all members of the sect disappeared. Years later a journalist tracked them down to a secret location in the forests of South America, but is not heard from again.From out of a mist a huge flying boat wings its way through the nighttime sky. Inside, Spermula and her cohorts are on their way back to civilization to bring their message of peace and freedom to a world gone mad by \\"spermulising\\" men, which involves drawing off their sexual essence that causes aggression, acquisitiveness and jealousy. They take up residence in a mansion, whose neighbors include the town's mayor, his unhappy and abused wife, his assistant and a widow.

It has been described as \\"a decision in a non-constitutional legal context that had indirect non-legal, but profound, constitutional consequences.\\" Background Peter McLaren, one of the parties in the case. The case arose from a controversy that came to be known as the \\"Lumbermen's Feud\\". Peter McLaren owned a lumber mill and had added timber slides on the Mississippi river and its northern tributaries that flowed through land that he owned in Lanark County, Ontario, in order to provide for transporting his own logs. Boyd Caldwell owned a rival mill, and was attempting to drive 18,000 logs through those slides. McLaren sued Caldwell's firm, B. Caldwell & Son, to restrain them from passing or floating timber and saw logs through his slides. Caldwell claimed that McLaren was unable to prevent the use of the river for the passage of his logs because of the statutes in force in Ontario. McLaren, however, asserted that he had the right to do so under the common law. In support of Caldwell, Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat arranged the passage of the Rivers and Streams Act, 1881 which required the unobstructed passage of logs, timber, rafts, etc. down all waterways in the province, whether improved or not, subject to the payment of any reasonable tolls. This Act was disallowed by the federal government under Sir John A. Macdonald on the grounds that it infringed upon private property rights. This conflict added fuel to the ongoing quarrel between the federal and provincial governments; the bill was re-enacted and disallowed again in 1882 and 1883. In an 1882 debate in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Mowat maintained that the Rivers and Streams Bill fell wholly within provincial jurisdiction, and asserted that federal disallowance could only take place: #when the Act is altogether illegal or unconstitutional, #when illegal or unconstitutional in part, #in cases of concurrent jurisdiction as clashing with the legislation of the General Parliament #when it affects the interests of the Dominion Parliament. The courts below On initial application to the Court of Chancery of Ontario, Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot granted the interlocutory injunction that was requested. That injunction was overturned on appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Court of Chancery of Ontario, in Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot's subsequent decision on 16 December 1880,as quoted in the Privy Council decision held that Caldwell could not drive his logs as the streams were found not to have been navigable or floatable for saw logs or other timber, rafts, and crafts when in a state of nature, and issued the appropriate injunction. Appeal was allowed by the Ontario Court of Appeal, where Spragge CJO held that Ontario law (originally enacted as ), re-enacted as made all streams, whether naturally or artificially floatable, public waterways. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal's decision was reversed on the grounds that: :* the streams in question were not floatable without the aid of artificial improvements, :* the appellant had at common law the exclusive right to use his property as he pleased, and to prevent respondents from using as a highway the stream in question where it flowed through appellant‚Äôs private property :* as held in the 1863 decision in Boale v. Dickson, the Ontario statute in question extends only to such streams as would, in their natural state, without improvements, during freshets, permit saw logs, timber, etc., to be floated down them Appeal to the Privy Council Lord Blackburn, author of the JCPC ruling. The Privy Council held in favour of Caldwell, ruling that the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal (stating that the Upper Canada Act had been misconstrued as to its effect in Boale v. Dickson) was correct. After reviewing Upper Canada's laws in the matter that had been enacted as early as 1828, it further declared: Aftermath As a result of the Privy Council's ruling, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the Rivers and Streams Act, 1884, which the federal government decided not to disallow. In order to assert its own jurisdiction, the Parliament of Canada subsequently passed the Navigable Waters Protection Act. Subsequent legislation on the issue had mixed results. McLaren v Caldwell established the principle in Canadian law that waterways are open to all, and that while private interests can charge a reasonable amount for the use of any improvements they have made, they cannot refuse passage to anyone. The victory was essentially a political one - Mowat's refusal to back down in the face of Macdonald‚Äôs intransigence made it more difficult for the federal government to disallow legislation that clearly fell under provincial jurisdiction, and led Macdonald increasingly to send matters to the courts. Essentially, disallowance was considered to be inconsistent with the rule of law, as well as being incompatible with the political conception of Canadian federalism. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in turn, increasingly ruled in favour of the provinces, with a broad interpretation of what constituted local matters. In that regard, it has been estimated that, in its history, the Judicial Committee overturned about half of all appeals from the Supreme Court of Canada, while only overturning about a quarter of all appeals from other Canadian courts.

(also Muzio, Mutius) (2 December 1563 - 9 February 1645) was the sixth Superior General of the Society of Jesus. He was the son of a noble Roman family. Although he was destined for a general ecclesiastical career, a growing desire to enter the Society of Jesus culminated in his taking private vows to enter the novitiate. His parents opposed this, possibly because of the promise not to seek ecclesiastical office or status that Jesuits make. However he was able to receive permission from Pope Gregory XIII, a strong supporter of the Jesuits, a concession to enter the novitiate against his family's will.  Work  Vitelleschi taught logic in 1588‚Äì1589, natural philosophy in 1589‚Äì1590, and metaphysics in 1590‚Äì15891; later he was professor of theology, then prefect of studies and finally he was elected general of the Society of Jesus in 1615. His lectures on natural philosophy include Physics, De caelo, De generatione, and Meteorology.  Early missions in the Society  After entering the novitiate on 15 August 1583, he taught in the Roman College, and then was appointed rector of the English College, Rome, enjoying two stints (1592‚Äì1594, and 1597‚Äì1598). He was also Provincial of the then Neapolitan Province, and later the Roman Province. Apart from his fame as a good teacher and orator, the only historical details that we have from these times are a sermon that he delivered to Pope Gregory, on Good Friday in 1590, on the passion of Christ.  Vitelleschi in fiction  He is portrayed positively as a minor figure in the fictional 1632 series, also known as the 1632-verse or Ring of Fire series, an alternate history book series, created, primarily co- written, and coordinated by historian Eric Flint.

It derives mainly from the civil law systems of European countries, particularly Portugal, the Napoleonic Code and the Germanic law. There are many codified statutes in force in Brazil. The current Federal Constitution, created on October 5, 1988, is the supreme law of the country. This Constitution has been amended many times. Other important federal law documents in the country include the Civil Code, the Penal Code, the Commercial Code, the National Tributary Code, the Consolidation of Labor Laws, the Customer Defense Code, the Civil Procedures Code and the Criminal Procedures Code. The Constitution organizes the country as a Federative Republic formed by the indissoluble union of the states and municipalities and of the Federal District. Under the principles established in the Federal Constitution, Brazil's 26 federate states have powers to adopt their own Constitutions and laws. Municipalities also enjoy restricted autonomy as their legislation must follow the dictates of the Constitution of the state to which they belong, and consequently to those of the Federal Constitution itself. As for the Federal District, it blends functions of federate states and of municipalities, and its equivalent to a constitution, named Organic Law, must also obey the terms of the Federal Constitution. Division of powers The powers of the Union, as defined within the Constitution, are the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary, which are independent and harmonious amongst themselves. The head of the Executive is the President of the Republic, which is both the Chief of State and the Head of Government and is directly elected by the citizens. The Legislative, embedded in the form of National Congress and consists of two houses: The Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and the Federal Senate (upper house), both constituted by representatives who are elected by the citizens. The Judicial powers are vested upon the Federal Supreme Court, the Superior Court of Justice, the Regional Federal Courts and Federal Judges. There are also specialized courts to deal with electoral, labor and military disputes. The Judiciary is organized into federal and state branches. Municipalities do not have their own justice systems, and must, therefore, resort to state or federal justice systems, depending on the nature of the case. The judicial system consists of several courts. The apex is the Federal Supreme Court and is the guardian of the Constitution. Among other duties, it has exclusive jurisdiction to: (i) declare federal or state laws unconstitutional; (ii) order extradition requests from foreign States; and (iii) rule over cases decided in sole instance courts, where the challenged decision may violate the Constitution. The Superior Court of Justice is responsible for upholding federal legislation and treaties. The five Regional Federal Courts, have constitutional jurisdiction on cases involving appeals towards the decision ruled by federal judges, and are also responsible for cases of national interest and crimes foreseen in international pacts, among other duties. The jurisdiction of the Federal Judges include: being responsible for hearing most disputes in which one of the parties is the Union (State); ruling on lawsuits between a foreign State or international organization and a municipality or a person residing in Brazil; and judging cases based on treaties or international agreements of the Union against a foreign State or international body. State-level justice in Brazil consists of state courts and judges. The States of Brazil organize their own judicial systems, with court jurisdiction defined in each state constitution, observing that their legal scope is limited by those that do not concern the federal judicial ordainment. The legislative process begins, in broad terms, with a bill of law in one of the Congress Houses, either the Chamber of Deputies or the Federal Senate, thus called the Originating House. Once the bill is voted on, it can either be rejected or forwarded to the other house, which is called the Reviewing House. There the bill can be rejected, approved or amended to be then returned to the Originating House. Depending on the object of the bill, it is forwarded for the presidential sanction or veto, as a whole or in part. If the bill is vetoed, the members of the National Congress of Brazil can override such veto.Legal system of Brazil  Constitution and law  Palace of Justice in Bras√≠lia For centuries, as a Portuguese colony, Law enforced in Brazil was the Law of Portugal. Famous students of Brazilian colonial era, among them many revolutionaries, graduated from the important Portuguese University of Coimbra, located in Central Portugal. With the Independence of Brazil and the rise of the Empire, it was necessary to create an independent judiciary and also to give its staff a legal education in the country. In 1827, the first law schools in Brazil were founded: the Academies of Law and Social Sciences in S√£o Paulo and Olinda.History - Law in Brazil Brazilian law is largely derived from Portuguese civil law and is related to the Roman-Germanic legal tradition. This means that the legal system is based on statutes, although a recent constitutional reform (Amendment to the Constitution 45, passed in 2004) has introduced a mechanism similar to the stare decisis, called s√∫mula vinculante. Nevertheless, according to article 103-A of the Brazilian Constitution, only the Supreme Court is allowed to publish binding rules. Inferior judges and courts, and the public administration, are hence obliged to obey the interpretations of the Supreme Court. In more recent times, according to the judiciary structure framed in the Brazilian Constitution, judicial power is divided between judicial branch of the states and the Federal judicial branch, and they have different jurisdictions. The prerogatives and duties of judges are the same, the differences being only in the competences, structure and composition of the Courts.  Law and lawyers  Court of Justice in S√£o Paulo In 2007, there were 1,024 Law school programs in Brazil, with 197,664 law students. Law schools are present in each of the States of Brazil.Number of Law schools in Brazil In the United States the number of law schools were only 180. The U.S. State of Alaska does not have a law school.Number of Law schools in the United States In 2010, the total of lawyers in Brazil were 621,885. The State of S√£o Paulo had the largest number, 222,807 lawyers, one third of all working lawyers in the country. The State of Rio de Janeiro had 112,515 lawyers, and the State of Minas Gerais had 63,978 lawyers.Total - Lawyers in Brazil by State - Bar Association of Brazil The Course of Law is one of the most prestigious and promising in the country. With a duration of five years and at the end of the course the student becomes a graduate, can not yet exercise the profession. While studying in a law school, the student will have all the knowledge needed to pursue the many professions related to law school, but must first pass the examinationAbout the Bar Examination in Brazil of the Bar Association of Brazil (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil in Portuguese).About the course of law in Brazil The overall median income of the Brazilian lawyer was R$36,120 per year in 2007. The starting median income was R$20,040, and the top median was R$3,000,000. The Brazilian judge had an overall median income of R$170,000. The starting median income was R$150,500, and the top median was R$310,500. The Brazilian prosecutors had an overall median income of R$150,000. The starting median income was R$140,000, and the top median was R$270,000 per year.Median income in Brazil Nowadays, Brazilian judges and prosecutors, in almost all states, earn the same, and, in some states, prosecutors have a higher income. State-level judiciary Court of Justice in Recife =Trial courts= Each state territory is divided into judicial districts named comarcas, which are composed of one or more municipalities. The 27 Courts of Justice have their headquarters in the capital of each State and have jurisdiction only over their State territories. The Federal District only presents the federal-level judicial branch. Each comarca has at least one trial court, a court of first instance. Each court of first instance has a law judge and a substitute judge. The judge decides alone in all civil cases and in most criminal cases. Only intentional crimes against life are judged by jury. The judges of the courts are nominated after a selection process. There are specialized courts of first instance for family litigation or bankruptcy in some comarcas. Judgments from these district courts can be the subject of judicial review following appeals to the courts of second instance. =Justice tribunals= The highest court of a state judicial system is its court of second instance, the Courts of Justice. In each Brazilian State there is one Court of Justice (Tribunal de Justi√ßa in Portuguese). Courts of Justice are courts of appeal, meaning they can review any decisions taken by the trial courts, and have the final word on decisions at state level, though their decisions may be overturned by the federal courts. Some states, as S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais, used to have Court of Appeals (Tribunal de Al√ßada in Portuguese) which had different jurisdiction. But the 45th Constitutional Amendment to the Brazilian Constitution,45th Constitutional Amendment text in its article four, decreed their extinction in order to simplify the second instance structure. Second instance judgments are usually made by three judges, called desembargadores. These Courts are divided into civil chambers, which judge civil cases, and criminal chambers. Judges of the Courts of Justice overview one another. A Court can expel any judge who has displayed unethical behavior. Federal-level judicial branch Supreme Federal Court of Brazil Regional Federal Courts (in number of 5) have jurisdiction over circuits of several states and tend to be headquartered in the largest city of their territory. The regional courts are: *The Regional Federal Court of the 1st Region has jurisdiction over the Federal District and 13 States: Minas Gerais, Bahia, Piau√≠, Maranh√£o, Goi√°s, Mato Grosso, Amap√°, Tocantins, Par√°, Amazonas, Roraima, Rond√¥nia and Acre, with headquarters in Bras√≠lia, Federal District. *The Regional Federal Court of the 2nd Region has jurisdiction over two States: Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo, with headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro. *The Regional Federal Court of the 3rd Region has jurisdiction over two States: S√£o Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul, with headquarters in S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo. *The Regional Federal Court of the 4th Region has jurisdiction over three States: Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paran√°, with headquarters in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. *The Regional Federal Court of the 5th Region has jurisdiction over six States: Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Para√≠ba, Cear√° and Rio Grande do Norte, with headquarters in Recife, Pernambuco. =Superior courts= Superior Court of Justice of Brazil There are two national superior courts making up the Supreme Court, which grant writs of certiorari in civil and criminal cases: the Superior Court of Justice (Superior Tribunal de Justi√ßa in Portuguese) or STJ and the Supreme Federal Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal in Portuguese) or STF, the highest Brazilian court (decides issues concerning offences to the Brazilian Constitution). The STJ is the Brazilian highest court in non- constitutional issues and grants a Special Appeal (Recurso Especial in Portuguese) when a judgement of a court of second instance offends a federal statute disposition or when two or more second instance courts make different rulings on the same federal statute. There are parallel courts for labor law, electoral law and military law. The STF grants Extraordinary Appeals (Recurso Extraordin√°rio in Portuguese) when judgements of second instance courts violate the constitution. The STF is the last instance for the writ of habeas corpus and for reviews of judgments from the STJ. The superior courts do not analyze any factual questions in their judgments, but only the application of the law and the constitution. Facts and evidences are judged by the courts of second instance, except in specific cases such as writs of habeas corpus.

Both the specific term used and the definition of a qualifying vehicle vary from country to country, as well as within a country if it is a federation. Typically, an antique vehicle is defined by its age at the time at which antique vehicle registration is sought. As examples, this age is 20 years in the U.S. state of Connecticut, 25 years in the U.S. state of Virginia, 30 years in the Australian state of Queensland, 30 years in Sweden and Brazil, and 35 years in Singapore. The United Kingdom requires that the vehicle was built before January 1, 1973 although the assumption is made that a vehicle first registered before January 7, 1973 was actually manufactured in 1972 and is therefore exempt from tax. Antique vehicle registration may provide certain benefits, such as a reduced or waived registration fee, exemption from vehicle inspection, and/or distinctive vehicle registration plates. However, the owner's privilege of driving the vehicle may be significantly curtailed. For example, in Virginia, the use of a car registered as an antique is limited to participation in car club activities, parades, and the like, driving to and from such events, testing, obtaining maintenance and repairs, and occasional pleasure driving within of one's residence.Virginia Code ¬ß 46.2-730 Commuting to and from work is specifically forbidden in Virginia. While having similar rules to the Virginia example above, Tennessee does not allow transfer of antique license plates between owners when a vehicle is sold so the original owner must surrender the antique plate and the new owner must apply for a new one. As of 2009, Tennessee allows transfer of an existing antique tag from a sold vehicle by the selling owner to another antique vehicle owned by the same owner. Operation of a vehicle registered under Tennessee's Antique program requires the vehicle owner to sign an affidavit upon registration certifying their understanding of the Antique Motor Vehicle law, which prescribes that the car is owned strictly as a collector's item, and in exchange for permanent registration of the unmodified antique vehicle that the vehicle is to be used only for parades, tours, testing and servicing, and club events, and is prohibited from serving as general transportation for the owner on any day other than Saturday or Sunday. In Tennessee, upon sale of the antique vehicle, the special Antique Auto plate is to be surrendered to the office of the owner's county clerk. Connecticut has no driving or registration restrictions on autos so registered. In Sweden there are no specific limits and the requirement for a yearly vehicle inspection is reduced to a bi-annual. The special license plate may take the form of a newly manufactured license plate with a legend such as \\"Antique\\", \\"Historic\\", \\"Early American\\", or \\"Horseless Carriage.\\" The license plate has a separate number sequence from ordinary license plates and may have a distinctive color scheme (for example, in Brazil, plates do have a reversed color scheme: normal plates are black on gray and antique plates are gray on black). Virginia has two series of such plates, one of which is designed to look old. Alternatively, under certain circumstances, the special license plate may be an authentic license plate from the same year as the model year of the car (called various terms such as \\"Year of Manufacture\\" or \\"Vintage,\\" depending on the jurisdiction). Virginia allows the use of such plates if they are embossed (not stickered) with the appropriate year. Tennessee allows the use of antique model year license plates for antique cars provided the car is specially registered as an antique vehicle and the state issued antique tag and registration are kept inside the vehicle for inspection upon demand by law enforcement personnel. As of 2009 Tennessee allows the registration of an antique vehicle with age appropriate antique tag(s)(either one or two plates depending on vehicle production year) within certain guidelines and with use restrictions as above. While the YOM law allows vehicle owners to display the vehicles as they were when first produced, it may not be legal for road use in other states.

Following a strong summer ratings run, the show was recommissioned, and began its second run in January 2006. Its third and final run ended at the beginning of September 2006. The show's name was derived from a French proverb, to be 'riche comme Cr√©sus'. Croesus was a notoriously wealthy king of Lydia from 561/560 to 547 BC, and participates in the show as a resurrected, computer-generated skeleton that interjects insults and additional knowledge alongside Lagaf'. The second French adaptation of El Legado is Les 12 Coups de midi, which premiered June 28, 2010 on TF1.  Format of the show Each player is given ‚Ç¨50,000 before Round 1, \\"L'une ou l'autre\\" (One or The Other) in series 1 & 3 - renamed \\"La R√©ponse Masqu√©e\\" (Hidden Answer) in series 2 - where each player is given a question along with an answer; the player must decide whether the correct answer is the one they've been provided or the second answer yet to be revealed. An incorrect answer means the player loses a life; a second incorrect answer means they face the 'Duel', where they must nominate a player to answer a multiple choice question, the difficulty of which varies according to the contestant's choice of a random A-B-C element. If they get it right, they stay in the game and their opponent is eliminated, along with seizing whatever sum of money was in the opponent's pot, and vice versa should the contestant get it wrong. Round 2 comprises \\"La Patate Chaude\\" (Hot Potato) - \\"Le Cadeau Empoisonn√©\\" (Tainted Gift) in series 2 - \\"√áa passe ou √ßa casse\\" (Make or Break) in series 3 - each contestant receives three answers to a question without seeing the question itself; having seen the answers, they decide if they want to play that question; if not, they designate another player to answer it; should that player get it right, the player that passed loses a life; an incorrect answer at any point loses a life, also; two lost lives lead to a 'Duel' once again. In series 3, the format is inversed: the question is given to the player, who has to guess the correct answer. Round 3 comprises \\"La D√©charge √âlectrique\\" (Electric Shock) in series 1 & 3 - \\"La Mort Subite\\" (Sudden Death) in series 2 - the three remaining contestants are provided with 10 answers to a question. One of them is wrong; contestants take it in turns to keep giving answers until someone opts for the one incorrect option, leading to an instant 'Duel'. \\"La Demi-Finale\\" sees the two remaining contestants given 70 seconds each, and are asked quick fire multiple choice questions on an alternating basis (i.e. once contestant A has given their correct answer, contestant B will be asked their question); their respective clocks stop as soon as they've given a correct answer, and keep running until they have given a correct answer to a question; the first person to run out of time loses. In addition, if one contestant's clock falls below three seconds, the other contestant can win by giving one more correct answer while saving more time on their own clock. The winner does not accumulate the prize money of the loser in the semifinal, however, meaning the maximum prize money is ‚Ç¨200,000. \\"La Finale\\" consists of five multiple choice questions, all with five responses: the first three questions offer a second attempt at the answer if the contestant opts for an incorrect option; the first answer must be taken on the final two questions. All the answers are revealed one after the other at the end of the show - four correct answers wins the contestant ‚Ç¨2,000 and the chance to play again the following day. A full five correct answers wins the jackpot.  Trivia  * TF1's working title for Cr√©sus was L'h√©ritage, spawned by the Italian version of the show L'eredit√† (which translates as 'The Inheritance'), on which the French production is heavily based. * The show's title was shortened at the last minute from Riche comme Cr√©sus to simply Cr√©sus - the former how the show was referred to in some TV listings publications throughout its run. * Lagaf' pitched four formats of his own to TF1 before agreeing to host Cr√©sus - one of which was a reworked version of the UK game show Play Your Cards Right. * Since September 2009, the show is renewed under the name Les 12 coups de midi (The Stroke of Midday), aired daily at 12:00 AM on TF1 and hosted by Jean-Luc Reichmann, with almost inchanged rules. The Cresus' skeleton is replaced by a fairy named Eulalie. A sole addition is the final √âtoile Myst√©rieuse (Mysterious Star), in which a small fragment of an hidden picture is revealed every day. The contestant has to guess which star is on the picture. Additionally, the final contestant of a show comes to play again on the next show.

As of March 31, 2007, iStockpro closed. iStockpro was a more expensive version of iStockphoto that was never as popular as iStockphoto, and became redundant after the acquisition by Getty Images. On April 1, 2008 Getty Images disclosed, as part of its agreement to be sold to a private equity firm, that iStockphoto's revenue in 2007 was $71.9 million USD of which $20.9 million (29%) was paid to contributors. Founder and CEO Livingstone left iStockphoto in 2009. He went on to co-found competitor Stocksy United in 2013. In 2013, iStockphoto was rebranded as iStock by Getty Images, removing the word 'photo' to convey that the company offers stock media other than just photography, such as vector illustrations, audio, and video.

Ownership of material controversy  This background of a movie poster for the 2011 film The Roommate was provided by iStockphoto. The image is that of the Christy Administration building at Southwestern College. The college believes this image was used without their permission. The 2011 film The Roommate obtained photos from iStockPhoto for its promotional material. One of the photos used as its backdrop was the Christy Administration Building from Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas. The college administration voiced concern that permission to use the photograph of the building was not properly obtained and is investigating the legality of its use.

The performer exploits the ambiguous wording of their patter to win the bet in a manner unexpected by the audience. It is often recommended for beginning magicians due to its entertaining and self-working nature. The trick has its origins as a short con. It has been described as an \\"old, old trick...used by circus grifters against the gullible and the greedy.\\" When performing for amusement, the performer will usually decline to collect on the bet.  Performance  The performer claims that they will be able to find a spectator's card in the deck by some means such as touch alone. They allow the spectator to select a card, memorize it, and return it to the deck. They then deal through the deck, turning cards face up onto the table. When the spectator's card is reached, the performer continues past it, ensuring that the participant notices that their card has been seemingly ignored by the apparently incompetent performer. After dealing several more cards, the performer announces that \\"The next card I turn over will be yours!\\" The spectator, having seen the magician pass the selected card, assumes that the performer refers to the next card on top of the deck and believes that the magician will fail the trick. The performer will at this point offer to wager a sum of money that the next card they turn over will indeed be the spectator's. Knowing that their card has been passed over, the spectator will usually feel this is a safe bet. Once the bet is accepted, the performer reaches over to the line of dealt cards and turns the spectator's card face down, thus technically winning the bet in an unexpected manner.  Method  The magician will have forced the spectator's card in some manner, ensuring they knew its position in advance or could spot it later. One method is for the performer to note the bottom card of the deck prior to starting the trick. When the selection is returned to the deck, the magician has it placed on top and gives the deck a cut, placing the card they noted above the selection. While dealing through the deck, the magician knows that the card after the one they noted (the original bottom card of the deck) is the selection.

In 1994, the Food and Drug Administration of the United States granted Mash an Investigational New Drug license, to permit her to research the addiction-stopping capabilities of ibogaine (an oneirogen that occurs in some plants). A lack of funding and other barriers prevented the research from proceeding. Mash and her colleagues had previously discovered that ibogaine is a prodrug that metabolizes into a psychoactive called 12-hydroxyibogamine (or, noribogaine). In the late 1990s she provided some assistance to Healing Transitions Institute for Addiction, a drug detoxification clinic in Canc√∫n where physicians oversaw patients' ibogaine treatments.

He served in the second-ranking post under Governor Buddy Roemer from 1988 to 1992. Background Hardy's parents, who married in 1939, were Florent Hardy, Sr., (1913‚Äì2003) and the former Agnes Angelle (1904‚Äì2008) of Cecilia in St. Martin Parish. Agnes Angelle was a homemaker, schoolteacher, and principal who was visited at school by former state education superintendents T. H. Harris and Shelby M. Jackson. Agnes's brother, Bob Angelle, and hence the maternal uncle of Paul Hardy, was a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1934 to 1964 and House Speaker from 1957 to 1960. Agnes's father, and hence Paul Hardy's maternal grandfather, was Drauzin Angelle, a constable, deputy sheriff, and a Democratic power broker in St. Martin Parish during much of the first half of the 20th century.\\"Drauzin Angelle\\", A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography, Vol. 1 (1988), p. 15 Paul Hardy has a sister, Mary Agnes Belleau and her husband, Dr. Charles Dewey Belleau, of Baton Rouge, and a brother, Florent Hardy, Jr., Ph.D., a long time employee of Louisiana State Archives and 2014 Public Official of the Year by the Louisiana Association of Museums. Hardy was born in Lafayette, Louisiana.\\"Louisiana: Paul Hardy\\", Who's Who in American Politics, 2007-2008 (Marquis Who's Who: New Providence, New Jersey, 2007), p. 660 In 1960, he graduated from Cecilia High School. In 1965, he received his bachelor's degree from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then the University of Southwestern Louisiana, from which his mother also graduated. While Hardy was on the USL track team, he won the Gulf States Conference high jump competition for two consecutive years. In 1966, Hardy received his law degree from Loyola University College of Law in New Orleans, and at the age of twenty-three, he began practicing law in St. Martinville with the firm Willis and Hardy. State senator and secretary of state In 1972, Hardy was elected as a Democratic state senator from Iberia and St. Martin parishes. The defunct Baton Rouge State Times named him the \\"Outstanding Newcomer\\" of the year after his first legislative session in 1972. He served alongside fellow Democrat Carl W. Bauer, who represented St. Mary and St. Martin parishes. In 1974, state Senator Hardy was named \\"Conservationist of the Year\\" among the elected official category by the Louisiana Wildlife Federation. In 1975, Hardy was elected, again as a Democrat, as Louisiana Secretary of State in another upset. An opening appeared when veteran Secretary of State Wade O. Martin, Jr., who was then a Democrat but later switched to the Republican Party, stepped down to launch an unsuccessful gubernatorial attempt. Hardy came from behind to beat his fellow Democratic opponent, State Representative P.J. Mills of Shreveport. In the primary, Mills had led with 49 percent of the vote. Hardy narrowly prevailed in the runoff‚Äîofficially the general election in Louisiana. He polled 388,780 votes (51.5 percent) to Mills' 366,510 (48.5 percent). Running for governor at 37 In 1979, Hardy ran for governor. Endorsed by former Governor John McKeithen, he carried eighteen parishes in the nonpartisan blanket primary, but he missed securing a general election berth by 4 percentage points. Hardy finished in fourth place with 227,026 votes (16.6 percent). In a disputed third place was outgoing Lieutenant Governor James E. \\"Jimmy\\" Fitzmorris, Jr., of New Orleans, with 280,760 (20.6 percent). The general election would feature Republican David C. Treen of Jefferson Parish, with 297,674 (21.8 percent), and Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Louis J. Lambert of Ascension Parish, with 283,277 (20.7 percent). Hardy hence lost a general election slot by some 56,000 votes. Fitzmorris filed suit in the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge, but Judge Douglas Gonzales, a Republican, ruled that Fitzmorris failed to provide evidence that enough fraudulent votes were cast for Lambert to impact the outcome of the second-place candidacy. Though he was still then a Democrat, Hardy endorsed Treen over Lambert. In 1978, he had supported the Republican Jimmy Wilson, a former state representative from Vivian for Louisiana's 4th congressional district seat in Congress, rather than the successful Democrat, Buddy Leach of Leesville. In 1976, Hardy endorsed then U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., over Jimmy Carter of Georgia, who polled Louisiana's ten electoral votes.Shreveport Times, November 20, 1979, p. 1B Thereafter, Treen, who narrowly defeated Lambert in the general election, appointed Hardy as Louisiana's secretary of transportation. While there, he supervised the spending of a record $2 billion on highways. When Hardy vacated the secretary of state's position, the two top votegetters, Sandra Thompson, director of the Atchafalaya Basin Culture, Recreation, and Tourism project, and State Senator James H. \\"Jim\\" Brown of Ferriday, went into a general election showdown. Brown emerged a narrow winner. Republican lieutenant governor Hardy switched parties and ran as a Republican in 1987 for lieutenant governor. First though he was for two weeks in January 1987 a gubernatorial candidate once again. After intraparty rival, U.S. Representative Bob Livingston of suburban New Orleans, defeated Hardy by a five-to-one margin at a caucus straw poll in Alexandria, Hardy said that he would not be a disrupting factor in the race. He therefore endorsed Livingston and incorrectly predicted that Livingston would be elected governor that year.\\"Guste bows out; Hardy jumps in,\\" Minden Press-Herald, January 7, 1987, p.1\\"Hardy withdraws from governor's race\\",Minden Press-Herald, January 21, 1987, p. 1 Instead, Hardy faced five opponents in the race for lieutenant governor, including the two-term Democratic incumbent, Robert Louis \\"Bobby\\" Freeman of Plaquemine in Iberville. Also in the race with Freeman and Hardy was Democrat William Ford \\"Bill\\" Dodd of Baton Rouge, son of former Democratic Lieutenant Governor Bill Dodd, who served from 1948 to 1952.Minden Press-Herald, March 13, 1987 Primary results gave Freeman 586,335 (40 percent), Hardy 429,906 (29 percent), and Dodd 242,519 (17 percent). Three other Democrats polled a total of 14 percent of the primary vote.Louisiana Secretary of State, Primary election returns, October 24, 1987 In the general election held on November 21, 1987, Hardy upset Freeman, 521,992 (53 percent) to 460,199 (47 percent). While Hardy was winning as lieutenant governor, State Representative W. Fox McKeithen, son of John McKeithen, was elected to Hardy's former position as secretary of state.Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 21, 1987 Incumbent Secretary of State James H. \\"Jim\\" Brown, originally from Ferriday in Concordia Parish, who had succeeded Hardy in 1980, had vacated the post to make an ill-fated run for governor. As lieutenant governor, Hardy led the way to enact legislation creating \\"Tax Free Shopping,\\" which still today gives foreigners an incentive to visit Louisiana. In turn, this concept has resulted in increases in tourism-related jobs, and in 1989 alone increased tourist spending by a record $1.2 billion. In 1985, Hardy had assisted local entrepreneurs in the production of the full-length feature film of the Cajun movie Belizaire the Cajun which was filmed in at Acadian Village in Lafayette. He was the associate producer and played a bit part in the movie. Under his leadership thereafter as lieutenant governor, the economic impact of the movie industry increased by $51 million. In 1989, Phi Kappa Theta national fraternal organization presented Hardy with the \\"Man of Achievement\\" award. In 1991, he was presented with \\"The Order of the Plimsoll,\\" the highest award of the New Orleans World Trade Center. Defeat in 1991 Hardy was defeated for reelection as lieutenant governor in 1991 by the Democrat Melinda Schwegmann of New Orleans, daughter-in-law of Jefferson Parish state legislator, gubernatorial candidate in 1971, and grocery mogul John G. Schwegmann, Jr., (1911‚Äì1995). In the primary, Hardy and Schwegmann virtually tied, 624,371 (43 percent) for Schwegmann and 620,199 (also 43 percent) for Hardy.Louisiana Secretary of State, Primary election returns, October 19, 1991 In the general election, Schwegmann scored a large victory, 1,009,026 (59 percent) to Hardy's 693,412 (41 percent). There was speculation that Schwegmann benefited from coattails of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Edwin Washington Edwards, who won his fourth nonconsecutive term as governor in that same election over the controversial Republican David Duke. Edwards polled 1,057,031 votes (61 percent) to Duke's 671,009 (39 percent). Hardy hence ran just some 22,000 votes above Duke's tabulation.Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 16, 1991 Hardy thereafter retired from politics. After she left the office of lieutenant governor, Schwegmann switched to the Republican Party. After a stint in the legislature, she attempted to regain the lieutenant governorship in the 2003 jungle primary but was badly defeated by Democrat Mitch Landrieu, brother of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu. Jay Dardenne, like Hardy a former state senator and secretary of state, became the second Republican to hold the position of lieutenant governor, the winner of a special election in 2010 to succeed Mitch Landrieu, who was elected mayor of New Orleans. Private life in Baton Rouge Hardy is an attorney, banker, businessman, and political consultant residing in Baton Rouge with his wife Sandra \\"Sandi\\" Gatlin Hardy (also born 1943), a native of Grant Parish in north Louisiana.

S. (c. 1420 - c. 1468; previously known as the Master of 1466) is an unidentified German engraver, goldsmith, and printmaker of the late Gothic period. He was the first major German artist of old master prints and was greatly copied and imitated. The name assigned to him by art historians, Master E. S., is derived from the monogram, E. S., which appears on eighteen of his prints (variants appear on others). The title, Master, is used for unidentified artists who operated independently. He was probably the first printmaker to place his initials on his work. Remaining signed works by E. S. indicate that he was active in printmaking from 1450 to 1467, the latest date to appear on one of his prints. After this date, he is presumed to have died. He was the most distinguished German engraver before Martin Schongauer.  Life  Lovers on a Grassy Bank Master E. S. probably came from southwestern Germany or Switzerland, as did the engraver called the Master of the Playing Cards. This view rests mainly on stylistic comparisons with the contemporary painting of that region. Although evidence indicates that he was most active in the Upper Rhine region, there also is evidence that he visited Mainz, to the south on the Rhine at the confluence of the Main River opposite Wiesbaden, a major economic and cultural centre. None of the attempts to match documented persons with his initials have met with general acceptance. The term master meant someone who had completed an apprenticeship and ran his own workshop, as E. S. clearly did. Marriage and employing apprentices to learn the skills could sometimes also be requirements. E. S. probably came from a background and training as a goldsmith, rather than as a painter. He sometimes used goldsmith punches in his prints (for example, to make the circles on the borders of the clothes in the Delilah print above) and some works are clearly designs for metalwork. He was the first printmaker to sign his prints with an engraved monogram, which was standard practice on significant pieces of metalwork. He engraved two images of Saint Eligius, the patron-saint of goldsmiths. He liked to fill his engravings with decorative detail, sometimes overloading the composition, and only slowly does a sense of volume or recession develop in his work. Since his earliest prints show a practiced use of the burin, he is presumed to have worked as a goldsmith for some years before beginning printmaking. His date of birth is estimated on this basis. His level of production of prints probably means that he worked on these only during his later years. Another important printmaker and goldsmith, Israhel van Meckenem, was probably his leading assistant at the end of his career and forty-one of his plates passed to him, being reworked by van Meckenem.  Work  Letter N of the Fantastic Alphabet, Master E. S., c. 1465 Shestack divides the engravings of E. S. into three stylistic periods: around 1450, up to 1460, and after 1460. During the second period he made significant technical developments. Firstly, deeper incisions with the burin, which allowed more impressions to be taken from each plate, although the number still may have been limited to about sixty or so, before wear on the plate began to show and reworking was necessary for it to be used again. His use of hatching (parallel lines) and cross-hatching to depict shading and volume, steadily grew more sophisticated and his figure-drawing became more confident, sometimes overconfident. Many figures of this period have contorted poses even when at rest. In works from the third period, his figures are more relaxed and flat surfaces are given prominence in the compositions. Many faces of his subjects have a rather pudding-like appearance, and are overly-large for their bodies, which diminishes the quality of otherwise, fine works . Much of his work still has great charm, and the secular and comic subjects he engraved are rarely found in the surviving painting of the period. Lehrs catalogues three hundred and eighteen engravings by E. S. and of these, ninety-five are unique, and fifty exist in only two impressions (copies). There are a further thirty-eight engravings by his probable assistant, Israhel van Meckenem, which are considered to be copies of engravings by E. S. which have not survived. In total, Shestack estimates, there may have been about five hundred engravings by E. S. Hind notes the influence of the Master of the Playing Cards on the work of Master E. S. He adds that \\"E. S. does not rank high as an artist, but on the technical side he was one of the greatest influences in the progress of the art of engraving.\\"  Drawings  Baptism of Christ a drawing attributed to Master E. S., Louvre Two very fine drawings, universally accepted as works by E. S., are in Berlin and the Louvre, but there are others which are disputed. The composition of the Baptism of Christ (picture at right), which is in the Louvre, was turned into two engravings by E. S., in doing which he complicated the compositions, filling empty spaces with new detail. Shestack considers that this reveals that his compositional method, here and perhaps commonly, was to begin by copying accurately a painting or other work by someone else. He then, in working on the engraving, introduced extra detail in a goldsmith's style. Ars Moriendi He produced a series of eleven engravings for the Ars moriendi (The Art of Dying), a very popular devotional work. These were no doubt intended to be inserted into a manuscript copy of the book. The very controversial question of whether these were copies of woodcut versions of the same compositions in blockbooks was effectively solved in 1942, when Fritz Saxl published a set of manuscript illuminations using the same compositions found in the London library of the Wellcome Institute. These clearly predated all printed versions, all of which now can be seen to be derived from no doubt different versions of manuscript drawings in the same tradition. It has also been suggested that E. S. later designed the woodcuts for the earliest of the blockbooks, which are now seen as being created later than his engravings.

Those wishing to become members must climb all 35 Catskill High Peaks and, in a departure from the requirements of most other such clubs, climb Slide, Blackhead, Balsam and Panther mountains again in winter, which is defined by the Club's by-laws as the period from December 21 to March 21 regardless of the actual occurrences of the winter solstice and vernal equinox in particular years. The Club also awards a separate patch for those who go on to climb all 35 peaks during winter. Until fairly recently it was the only hiking organization with a specific Catskill focus. Membership 3500 Club summit canister, shown prior to change in color and removal of exterior text requested by NYSDEC. Members record their climbs on a tally sheet and then submit them to the Club's membership chair when they have completed their last required peak. This is mostly done on the honor system; however sometimes the tally sheets are cross- checked against the logs kept in the canisters the club maintains at the summits of the 13 peaks that lack a trail to the summit. there are 1,599 regular members and 626 winter members. Those who have not yet finished the prescribed 39 climbs (35 regular, 4 winter) are referred to as aspirants. Members and aspirants alike may subscribe to the quarterly newsletter of the organization, The Catskill Canister, for $10 per annum. In the case of members, this payment additionally represents an annual dues payment; those who are paid up are considered active members. The organization offers lifetime memberships. History The Club traces its origins to the early 1950s, when Dan Smiley, a descendant of the founders of Mohonk Mountain House and his fellow birders were trying to track down the elusive Bicknell's thrush, then considered an unimportant subspecies of the gray-cheeked thrush. Since it prefers to mate and spend its summers in cool, shady places like the boreal forests found on the summits of higher mountains in the Northeast, Smiley and his fellow birders drew up a list of the peaks in the Catskills over 3,500 feet and thus likely to have such forestation. Their goal was not to bag peaks but simply to find the thrush. Nonetheless, they published their list of (at that time) 33 peaks in a nature journal. Area hikers who saw it began organizing trips to the peaks with an eye toward completing the list, and in 1962 informally organized the club as a Catskill counterpart to the well-established Adirondack Forty-Sixers. Later that year William and Elinore Leavitt of Hudson became the first two members of the club, after newly issued maps resulted in the addition of Friday and Mount Sherrill to the list at the expense of Dry Brook Ridge. In 1966 the Club was formally incorporated, and has counted that year as its founding date ever since. The Leavitts and 23 others who had climbed all the peaks in the meantime were accepted as charter members. Three of the five people who had played important roles in founding the club were, for various reasons, never able to become members; and Dan Smiley himself died with only one climb left for membership. The peak list would remain in this form until 1991, when Southwest Hunter Mountain, a trailless peak lacking an official name, was added after a contentious membership vote. It had originally been left off the list due to uncertainty over whether it was really a separate peak or not and the difficulty of establishing where its summit was. Activities The Club sponsors hikes on almost every weekend of the year to the various peaks, and sometimes to other mountains of interest in the Catskills. It is also responsible for maintaining the trail over Peekamoose and Table mountains, and does litter cleanup on the section of Route 214 south of Stony Clove Notch (Both routes are currently part of the Long Path long-distance hiking trail). Every spring it holds an annual dinner in Kingston along with its membership meeting, at which new members and winter members from the previous year who are in attendance receive their patches and any matters requiring the vote of the full membership are taken up. It is usually followed by a presentation on some matter of interest concerning the Catskills. All activities are listed in the Club‚Äôs quarterly newsletter, the Catskill Canister, which also includes poetry, short articles about hiking and the Catskills and news about members. Advocacy It has also advocated for the interests of hikers in the Catskills, lobbying against the construction of a trail up the north ridge of Slide and in favor of expanding the amount of Forest Preserve designated as wilderness, for example. In recent years the Club has also begun to take a more active stewardship role, helping to raise money for construction and maintenance efforts and land purchases. =Canister controversy= This role brought it into conflict with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which manages the Catskill lands, in 1999 when DEC's Unit Management Plan for the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area called for the removal of the canisters from the trailless peaks in that unit, arguing that they were not consistent with wilderness values and contributed to degradation of the summits. After an overwhelming response in favor of retaining them, DEC and the Club reached a compromise in the pending update to the Catskill Park State Land Master Plan in which DEC would take over ownership of the canisters, the names of mountains would be removed from the exteriors and the canisters themselves repainted a dull grey on those summits that lie within areas designated Wilderness by the DEC.

The station broadcasts at 88.9 FM in Kelowna. History The station was launched in 1987. Prior to its launch, CBC Radio programming aired in Kelowna on private affiliate CKOV 630 in the AM band, while most of its other transmitters were rebroadcasters of Vancouver's CBU. Local programming CBTK-FM produces its own local morning show, Daybreak South with Chris Walker, as well as a local afternoon show, Radio West with Sarah Penton, which airs across the whole interior of British Columbia. Rebroadcasters On April 12, 1985, the CRTC approved an application by the CBC to amend the broadcasting licences for CBXH, CBDA and CBKI by changing the frequencies from 1450 to 1540; 1240 to 1560; and 1450 to 1350. These AM transmitters were eventually converted to FM or shutdown. =FM conversions= * On October 13, 2011, CBTK applied to convert CBRD 860 to 97.1 MHz. The application was approved on December 15, 2011. CBRD's callsign was replaced by CBTK-FM-1 once the flip occurred. * On August 16, 2013, CBTK-FM applied to relocate CBRJ 860 to 107.3 MHz. This application was approved on October 31, 2013. * On September 23, 2014, the CBC was approved to convert CBUI 740 to 102.5 MHz. * On September 1, 2017, the CBC applied to convert CBUM to 91.3 MHz.

As well another low-power AM transmitter CBWD 900 in Donald was also deleted. Radio One programming in these communities are available from adjacent transmitters CBXE-FM and CBUQ-FM, the closest Radio One transmitters to Parson. =Split of CBYK-FM into separate network= CBTK-FM was previously repeated on CBYK-FM Kamloops and on 22 CBC radio repeaters in the Thompson and Cariboo regions. On October 28, 2011, the CBC filed an application with the CRTC to convert CBYK-FM to an anchor of a new regional CBC Radio One network. The CRTC approved the new regional network on March 30, 2012, with a start-up date slated for October 9, 2012. CBUC-FM, which was originally to have been part of the new network, will remain a repeater of CBTK-FM, following interventions from various parties, including the City of Salmon Arm, that the region is more economically-tied with the Okanagan region than with Kamloops. Shortly after CBYK-FM's launch as a separate station, residents of Revelstoke complained to the CRTC that they were not consulted by the CBC when they switched their local repeater, CBTO-FM 91.3, to CBYK-FM's programming; e-mails made to the city's mayor's office show that 80% of listeners prefer programming from Kelowna, while only 20% prefer the new Kamloops programming. The CRTC later said that it is up to the CBC to decide which programming originates for CBTO-FM, not the CRTC. After city officials contacted the CBC, BC spokesperson Lorna Haeber said that the CBC would make a decision on the issue \\"shortly\\", but failed to elaborate how or when the decision will be made. The CRTC subsequently issued a notice that it had approved an application by the CBC to change the local programming source of its Radio One transmitter in Revelstoke from Kamloops back to Kelowna. The change was implemented on January 2, 2014.

Multiple surveys among nature lovers have ranked it as the country's most beautiful peak. Readily accessible along maintained marked trails and with the exceptional vistas afforded from its summit, it is the hikers' favorite mountain in the western part of the High Tatras. Kriv√°≈à has also been a major symbol in Slovak ethnic and national activism for the past two centuries. It has been referenced in works of art from 19th-century literature, through paintings, film documentaries, to a Polish rock track. A country-wide vote in 2005 selected it to be one of the images on Slovakia's euro coins. Name The name Kriv√°≈à, first recorded as Kriwan in 1639, is derived from the root kriv- meaning \\"bent\\" or \\"crooked\\". It reflects the angled appearance of its shape when viewed from the west and south, characterized in the work from 1639 as an \\"oxtail\\" (cauda bubula in the Latin original).David Fr√∂lich, Medulla Geographiae Practicae, Peregrinantium inprimis usui, deinde Historiarum & rerum hoc tempore bellicosissimo gestarum... 1639; referenced in several works including: Ivan Bohu≈°, Alojz Lutonsk√Ω and J√°n Olejn√≠k, Kriv√°≈à. 1968. The Slovak name is used in other languages including in Polish, rather than its potential Polonized version (Krzywa≈Ñ), except occasionally in Podhale in the immediate vicinity of the Tatras. Two adjacent peaks in the nearby Mal√° Fatra range carry the same name, and so does the village of Kriv√°≈à farther away in southern Slovakia. History =Elevation= Based merely on visual observation, Kriv√°≈à competed for the status of the highest mountain in the High Tatras with Lomnick√Ω ≈°t√≠t, which dominates the view from the east, until 1793 when the latter was accurately identified as the higher of the two (but wrongly as the highest peak in the mountain range, an error corrected by Ludwig Greiner in 1837): \\"The weather was very fine, and the Krivan, having got in the night a cap of snow, looked sublime...\\" R. Townson, 1793 > [Kriv√°≈à] is generally said to be the highest of all the Alps in the > Carpathian chain; but this opinion is not supposed to be founded upon any > measurement.Robert Townson, Travels in Hungary, with a short account of > Vienna in the year 1793. 1797. The relative elevations of the two mountains were determined by the English natural historian Robert Townson, who ascended both peaks in August 1793 and also made an early recorded comment on Kriv√°≈à's aesthetic appeal: > The weather was very fine, and the Krivan, having got in the night a cap of > snow, looked sublime. [...] 1888 yards above the village of Vasetz [Va≈æec]; > the Krivan is therefore something lower than the Lomnitz Peak [Lomnick√Ω > ≈°t√≠t]. The exact elevation of Kriv√°≈à is currently recognized as Kriv√°≈à is believed to have the greatest height from its base in the whole Tatras, as it rises from the bottom of the K√¥prova valley or from Tri Studniƒçky up to . =Ascents= Before 1800 A travel book Ungarisher oder Dacianisher Simplicissimus written by Daniel Georg Speer in 1693 mentions a current legend (may have more ancient roots) explaining how Krivan got its shape. Lucifer (the carrier of light) flew over Tatras carrying some people to hell. His foot tripped on the tip of Krivan which got bent, and losing his balance he dropped the sinners who populated since the county of Liptov. Records of explorations by miners in the Kriv√°≈à massif date to the first half of the 15th century. Their presence increased during the gold rush of the 16th century. Although they may not have been the first to do so, it is probable that some of the miners reached the top of Kriv√°≈à; remnants of their shacks have survived below Priehyba Ridge at the elevation of about 2,000 m (6,560 ft.) through the present, and the highest, long abandoned, Ter√©zia Shaft is merely about 60 m (200 ft.) below the summit. The commercial exploitation of the meager deposits discovered at Kriv√°≈à proved to be barely viable. It was abandoned in the 18th century.Ivan Houdek, Osudy Vysok√Ωch Tatier; dejinn√Ω n√°ƒçrtok so zvl√°≈°tnym zreteƒæom na Kriv√°≈à. 1936. The Scottish doctor Townson who ascended it in 1793 provided some evidence that Kriv√°≈à was already a recognized occasional destination for tourists in the second half of the 18th century. His guide from Va≈æec had been to the top several times before and Townson saw him collect small coins from under a summit stone where hikers would leave them for luck. The first recorded ascent of Kriv√°≈à was by the Lutheran Pastor Andreas Jonas Czirbes from Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves on 4 August 1773.Several sources give the year as 1772, more say 1773 including: Szil√°rd Schermann, Sz√∂gescip≈ëk nyomai a K√°rp√°tok b√©rcein. 1937. Celebrities Frederick II The first celebrity to attempt ascent of Kriv√°≈à was the 30-year-old Habsburg Archduke Joseph in 1806, but the plan was abandoned due to inclement weather although parts of the winding road to the old gold mine high on the slopes had already been improved and a campsite built. The first VIP actually to reach the summit was the 43-year-old King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony in 1840. The plaque placed at the top to commemorate the first monarch who stood there was gradually destroyed by activists in the 1850s-1860s, who would have wished the inscription to include a comment in Slovak and who objected to where the inscription spoke of the Hungarian (ethnic) nation in reference to all the subjects of the Kingdom of Hungary. Lower nobleman , an influential publisher based at Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈° 20 miles from Kriv√°≈à, and his six friends climbed to the top of Kriv√°≈à on 24 Sept. 1835, which he described in the literary journal Hronka in 1837. The account may have stimulated its readers who lived farther away to follow their steps.Branislav Choma, Hornoliptovsk√Ω pante√≥n: Na 650. v√Ωroƒçie prvej p√≠somnej zmienky o hr√°dockom hrade z roku 1341. 1993. ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r The ascent that became most memorable in Slovak culture was by ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r, then a 25-year-old teaching assistant of Slovak at the Bratislava Lutheran L√Ωceum (a preparatory high school and college).

The historical winding road built by miners for horse-drawn ore carts and used by hikers in the past, including the participants of the revered 1841 excursion, is between the green and blue trails and links up with the green trail above the timberline below Priehyba Ridge.It is shown with a dash-dotted line on this map: \\"Kriv√°≈à, mapa.\\" vysoke- tatry.sk The road is not marked, the Tatra National Park management decreed it off limits. It is partly obscured by shrubby mountain pines at higher elevations. Kriv√°≈à has been favored by those appreciative of its aesthetic and historical allure, as well as by those who seek vistas from the top. Polls of nature lovers at large as well as of connoisseurs have consistently rated it as Slovakia's most beautiful mountain. The 360-degree view from the top is among the best in Slovakia with the scenery ranging from the populated valleys of upper Liptov, Spi≈°, and distant parts of Podhale, to the rugged drops of its north face, and many of the notable peaks of the Tatras including Giewont over Zakopane, Rysy, Lomnick√Ω ≈°t√≠t, and Gerlach, the highest peak of the Carpathians. The panorama is framed by the Western and Low Tatras, and by mountain ranges beyond them in good visibility.Vladim√≠r Adamec, Slovensko: 69 vyhliadkov√Ωch vrcholov. 1981. View of the Western Tatras from the summit of Kriv√°≈à Cultural images =Early development= The mountain is mentioned by Nikolai Gogol as the abode of two Cossack brothers, Ivan and Petro, in his short story 'The Terrible Vengeance', written in 1832. After lower nobleman Ga≈°par Fej√©rpataky Belopotock√Ω (1794-1874) published an account of his 1835 ascent of Kriv√°≈à in the literary journal Hronka in 1837, its editor-in-chief Karol Kuzm√°ny (1806-1866) wrote the novella Ladislav (1838), whose title character, taking the long way home from Italy via Germany and the Polish Podhale, hikes to the summit of Kriv√°≈à where he and his friends talk about brotherhood among the Slavs, sing ethnically-nationally arousing songs, and imbibe Tokaj wine. Both works may have motivated the hike by ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r and friends in 1841 that inspired him to write two poems published in 1842.Jacek Ko≈Çbuszewski, Modele estetyczne liryki s≈Çowackiej romantycznego prze≈Çomu. 1975. Romantic poets soon became fervent admirers of the eye-catching mountain. Eugen V. ≈†parnensis (1827-after 1853) called Kriv√°≈à a marker of his homeland, the Slovaks were \\"Kriv√°≈à's children\\" for Janko Kr√°ƒæ, Samo Chalupka's poem saw the mountain as a symbol of their place among the nations.Pavol Maz√°k, et al. Dejiny slovenskej literat√∫ry 2: Nov≈°ia slovensk√° literat√∫ra, 1780-1918. 1984. =Popular culture= The significance the intellectuals began to ascribe to Kriv√°≈à and its images they created were gradually adopted by popular culture. An early instance is the poem Oh, Below Kriv√°≈à (Hej, pod Kriv√°≈àom; originally: Hej, pod Mur√°≈àom) by Samuel Tom√°≈°ik (1813-1887), which came to be seen as an anonymous folk song[chor and pa], \\"Profil: Slovensk√Ω pred≈°t√∫rovsk√Ω b√°snik Samuel Tom√°≈°ik sa narodil pred 195 rokmi.\\" TASR, 7 Feb. 2008. and is sometimes featured as such on folk albums.

The EE version was the only sarrusophone that was ever mass-produced in the United States. It was made by companies such as Gautrot, Couesnon, Romeo Orsi, Rampone (and Cazzani), Buffet Crampon (Evette and Schaeffer), and C.G. Conn.  Tone  The EE‚ô≠ sarrusophone has the tone of a reedy contrabass saxophone, while the CC sarrusophone sounds much like the contrabassoon. The BB‚ô≠ contrabass sarrusophone is the lowest of the sarrusophones, and was the lowest-pitched wind instrument until the invention of the EEE‚ô≠ octocontra-alto and the BBB‚ô≠ octocontrabass clarinets, and the BB‚ô≠ subcontrabass tubax. Contrabass sarrusophones come in two bore widths: big pipes, which sound mellower and softer, but are still reedy; and small pipes, which are extremely reedy. The EE and BB sarrusophones are transposing instruments. The contrabass sarrusophone is sometimes confused with the reed contrabass, to which it bears a superficial resemblance.  Reed  Contrabass sarrusophones take rather large reeds; they are larger than contrabassoon reeds. This leads to most people making their own reeds (as is the practice of most oboe and bassoon players). Contrabass sarrusophone reeds are still manufactured by Vandoren. Sarrusophones are traditionally played with a double reed, but single reed mouthpieces have also been used. These mouthpieces are similar in size to soprano or alto saxophone mouthpieces.  Size  Contrabass sarrusophones are extremely light for contrabass instruments, weighing only about as much as a baritone saxophone, and being approximately four feet tall, about the same height as a bass saxophone. This makes them more convenient to carry around, fitting into cars more easily, and putting less strain on one's muscles while carrying or playing it. Conn made contrabass sarrusophones, instead of contrabass saxophones, because the sarrusophones were easier to ship across seas, and to send through the mail, due to their lightness.  Use  = Classical = The sarrusophone is rarely scored in classical music today, but there are a few examples. Pieces written for it include Percy Grainger's Over the Hills and Far Away, Paderewski's Symphony in B Minor (Polonia), which called for three EE‚ô≠ contrabass sarrusophone players, Maurice Ravel's Rapsodie Espagnole, Sheherazade and L\`heure espagnole, and Arrigo Boito's Nerone. Paul Dukas also used it in his orchestral tone poem The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Claude Debussy includes the CC instrument in Jeux, as does Frederick Delius in Eventyr, Requiem and Songs of Sunset. Jules Massenet writes for it in Esclarmonde. The instrument is given notable solos in Arnold Bax's First Symphony, written in 1921‚Äì22. Igor Stravinsky's first fully serial work, Threni (1958), a symphonic/choral setting of passages from the Latin Vulgate of the Book of Lamentations, includes a sarrusophone in its unusual scoring, which also features a solo Flugelhorn. American composer Barney Childs composed a chamber work, The Golden Bubble (1967), for EE‚ô≠ contrabass sarrusophone and one percussionist. Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji frequently utilized the contrabass sarrusophone, calling for it in his 1st, 4th, and 8th piano concertos, Opus clavisymphonicum for piano and orchestra, his two orchestral symphonies and the Messa grande sinfonica.https://roberge.mus.ulaval.ca/srs/05-orche.htm = Jazz = The song \\"Mandy Make Up Your Mind\\" recorded in 1924 with Louis Armstrong features an extended solo by Sidney Bechet on EEb Contrabass Sarrussophone and continues to feature him for approximately the last half of the song.

Steven \\"Steve\\" Crosetti is a fictional character on the television drama series Homicide: Life on the Street portrayed by actor Jon Polito for the show's first two seasons. He is believed to be based on Baltimore Police Department Det. Terry McLarney, who was in the BPD homicide unit in David Simon's book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets; the character's ancestry was changed from Irish to Italian because Polito got the role.Interview with Polito: \\"There were two characters, and the one character I liked‚Äîwhich I eventually got to play‚Äîwas an Irish name\\" Crosetti is a veteran police detective who is partnered with Meldrick Lewis. A deeply religious man, Crosetti is shown to have both a scapular and a rosary. In one episode, he recounts an incident several years before when he had been gunned down, hit with at least three rounds. He spent considerable time in recovery, requiring multiple operations. As evidenced by the teleplay in \\"Gone for Goode\\" and later \\"Rockets' Dead Glare\\", Crosetti was fascinated and probably obsessed by the Lincoln assassination and rejected the belief that John Wilkes Booth was the lone assassin. In the first episode, he tells Meldrick he was up all night pondering the assassination. In \\"Rockets' Dead Glare\\", he is like a little kid when being shown Washington DC sites with any connection to Lincoln or Booth by the FBI Agent played by Ed Lauter. A dear friend of Crosetti's, a police officer named Chris Thormann, is shot in the head while apprehending a suspect. Thormann survives, but is left blind and deeply depressed. Crosetti tries his best to help him and his wife get through it, and forces himself into the investigation. Eventually, his emotions cloud his judgment and he apprehends the wrong suspect, but Lewis eventually arrests the right one. This storyline was based on the real-life shooting and blinding of BPD Officer Gene Cassidy, and is a major part of the David Simon book which spawned the series. Crosetti's own marriage had fallen apart sometime before the beginning of the series. He has a teenage daughter, Beatrice, whom Crosetti says \\"was as close to perfection as God allows.\\" He apparently has at least joint custody. Crosetti is very protective of her, and is appalled that her mother was indifferent to the girl's having a boyfriend over to spend the night. Crosetti is said to have taken an extended vacation at the end of season 2. Lewis mentions that he goes to Atlantic City. In the sixth episode of season 3, \\"Crosetti\\", Detectives Stanley Bolander and John Munch are called when a body is fished out of the bay. The body turns out to be Crosetti, and the initial evidence suggests a suicide. Lewis refuses to believe that Crosetti would kill himself, especially in light of his faith and his daughter. Lewis does everything he can to get the death classified a homicide, even going as far as to tell Crosetti's friends and neighbors not to give any information to Bolander (the primary detective on the case). He finally accepts the truth when he hears the medical examiner's report, which states that Crosetti had high levels of alcohol, tranquilizers, and antidepressants in his system and died by drowning. Lewis later recalls that before his vacation Crosetti had offered to give a him a childhood possession of his, a valuable vintage yo-yo, and realizes this was possibly a kind of going-away present. Because his death was a suicide, the department refuses an honor guard at the funeral. Frank Pembleton, unwilling to attend the church funeral after his faith was shaken on a recent case, stands alone in his dress blues on the station house steps, saluting the fallen detective as the procession goes by. Lewis carries a lot of guilt over Crosetti's death, thinking back constantly to see if there had been any hint of Crosetti's suicidal tendencies beforehand. His death also deeply affects the other detectives in the squad (especially during the third season), as the reasons for Crosetti's suicide are never explained. The episode itself mentioned job stress, the divorce, and a possible gambling addiction as possible motives; but never confirmed any specific reason. The actor who played Crosetti, Jon Polito, also expressed a certain discomfort with the character's committing suicide. Because NBC aired some of the Season 3 episodes out of order, a mention of a still living Crosetti appeared after the episode that revealed the suicide. Crosetti's final appearance is in the TV movie Homicide: The Movie, which concluded the series. Polito has a cameo role in which Crosetti appears in an afterlife sequence along with other deceased characters.

In every war fought by or within the United States, African Americans participated, including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the Civil War, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the World Wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other minor conflicts.  Revolutionary War  Crispus Attucks was an iconic patriot; engaging in a protest in 1770, he was shot by royal soldiers in the Boston Massacre. African Americans, both as slaves and freemen, served on both sides of the Revolutionary War. Gary Nash reports that recent research concludes there were about 9,000 black soldiers who served on the American side, counting the Continental Army and Navy, state militia units, as well as privateers, wagoneers in the Army, servants, officers and spies.Gary B. Nash, \\"The African Americans Revolution\\", in Oxford Handbook of the American Revolution (2012) edited by Edward G Gray and Jane Kamensky, pp. 250‚Äì70, at p. 254. Ray Raphael notes that while thousands did join the Loyalist cause, \\"A far larger number, free as well as slave, tried to further their interests by siding with the patriots.\\"Ray Raphael, A People's History of the American Revolution (2001), p. 281. Black soldiers served in Northern militias from the outset, but this was forbidden in the South, where slave- owners feared arming slaves. Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, issued an emancipation proclamation in November 1775, promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the British; Sir Henry Clinton issued a similar edict in New York in 1779. Over 100,00 slaves escaped to British lines, although only roughty 1,000 served on the front lines. Many Black Loyalist descendants now resident in Canada and Sierra Leone. Many of the Black Loyalists performed military service in the British Army, particularly as part of the only Black regiment of the war, the Black Pioneers, and others served non-military roles. In response, and because of manpower shortages, Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. All-black units were formed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts; many were slaves promised freedom for serving in lieu of their masters; another all- African-American unit came from Haiti with French forces. At least 5,000 African-American soldiers fought as Revolutionaries, and at least 20,000 served with the British. Peter Salem and Salem Poor are the most noted of the African-American Patriots during this era, and Colonel Tye was perhaps the most noteworthy Black Loyalist. African Americans also served with various of the South Carolina guerrilla units, including that of the \\"Swamp Fox\\", Francis Marion,Gray, Jefferson M., \\"Francis Marion Foils the British\\", Military History Quarterly, August 3, 2011. half of whose force sometimes consisted of free Blacks. These Black troops made a critical difference in the fighting in the swamps, and kept Marion's guerrillas effective even when many of his white troops were down with malaria or yellow fever. The first black American to fight in the Marines was John Martin, also known as Keto, the slave of a Delaware man, recruited in April 1776 without his owner's permission by Captain of the Marines Miles Pennington of the Continental brig USS Reprisal. Martin served with the Marine platoon on the Reprisal for a year and a half and took part in many ship-to-ship battles including boardings with hand-to- hand combat, but he was lost with the rest of his unit when the brig sank in October 1777. At least 12 other black men served with various American Marine units in 1776‚Äì1777; more may have been in service but not identified as blacks in the records. However, in 1798 when the United States Marine Corps (USMC) was officially re-instituted, Secretary of War James McHenry specified in its rules: \\"No Negro, Mulatto or Indian to be enlisted\\". Marine Commandant William Ward Burrows instructed his recruiters regarding USMC racial policy, \\"You can make use of Blacks and Mulattoes while you recruit, but you cannot enlist them.\\" The policy was formulated to set a higher standard of unit cohesion for Marines, with the unit to be made up of only one race, so that the members would remain loyal, maintain shipboard discipline and help put down mutinies. The USMC maintained this policy until 1942.  War of 1812  Painting of Battle of Lake Erie depicting one of Perry's African-American oarsmen in the boat and another African-American sailor in the water During the War of 1812, about one-quarter of the personnel in the American naval squadrons of the Battle of Lake Erie were black, and portrait renderings of the battle on the wall of the nation's Capitol and the rotunda of Ohio's Capitol show that blacks played a significant role in it. Hannibal Collins, a freed slave and Oliver Hazard Perry's personal servant, is thought to be the oarsman in William Henry Powell's Battle of Lake Erie.Copes, p. 63. This is in some dispute. See here Collins earned his freedom as a veteran of the Revolutionary War, having fought in the Battle of Rhode Island. He accompanied Perry for the rest of Perry's naval career, and was with him at Perry's death in Trinidad in 1819. No legal restrictions regarding the enlistment of blacks were placed on the Navy because of its chronic shortage of manpower. The law of 1792, which generally prohibited enlistment of blacks in the Army became the United States Army's official policy until 1862. The only exception to this Army policy was Louisiana, which gained an exemption at the time of its purchase through a treaty provision, which allowed it to opt out of the operation of any law, which ran counter to its traditions and customs. Louisiana permitted the existence of separate black militia units which drew its enlistees from freed blacks. A militia unit, In Louisiana, the 2nd Battalion of Free Men of Color, was a unit of black soldiers from Santo Domingo led by a Black free man and Santo-Domingue emigre Joseph Savary offered their services and were accepted by General Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans, a victory that was achieved after the war was officially over. Blacks fought at the Battle of Bladensburg 24 August 1814, many as members of Commodore Joshua Barney's naval flotilla force. This force provided crucial artillery support during the battle. One of the best accounts is that Charles Ball born 1785. Ball served with Commodore Joshua at the Battle of Bladensburg and later helped man the defenses at Baltimore. In his 1837 memoir, Ball reflected on the Battle of Bladensburg: \\"I stood at my gun, until the Commodore was shot down‚Ä¶ if the militia regiments, that lay upon our right and left, cold have been brought to charge the British, in close fight, as they crossed the bridge, we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time; but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs.\\"Charles Ball Slavery in the United States: A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Charles Ball, a Black Man, Who Lived Forty Years in Maryland, South Carolina and Georgia, as a Slave Under Various Masters, and was One Year in the Navy with Commodore Barney, During the Late War (New York: John S. Taylor 1837). Barney's flotilla group included numerous African Americans who provided artillery support during the battle. Modern scholars estimate blacks made up between 15‚Äì20%, of the American naval forces in the War of 1812.Charles E. Brodine, Michael J. Crawford and Christine F. Hughes, editors Ironsides! The Ship, the Men and the Wars of the USS Constitution (Fireship Press, 2007), 50. Just before the battle Commodore Barney on being asked by President James Madison \\"if his negroes would not run on the approach of the British?\\" replied: \\"No Sir‚Ä¶they don't know how to run; they will die by their guns first.\\"Elizabeth Dowling Taylor A Slave in the White House: Paul Jennings and the Madison's Palgrave (McMillen: New York 2012), p. 49. The Commodore was correct, the men did not run, one such man was young sailor Harry Jones (no.35), apparently a free black. Harry Jones was wounded in the final action at Bladensburg. Due to the severity of Jones wounds, he remained a patient at the Naval Hospital Washington DC for nearly two months.Register of Patients at Naval Hospital Washington DC 1814 With the Names of American Wounded from the Battle of Bladensburg Transcribed with Introduction and Notes by John G.

Register states \\"Harry Jones black boy wound Bladensburg\\". \\"Boy\\", in this context, was a reference to rank. Boys in early navy were simply young sailors in training aged 12 to 18. African Americans also served with the British. On April 2, 1814, Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane issued a proclamation to all persons wishing to emigrate, similar to the aforementioned Dunmore's Proclamation some 40 years previous. Any persons would be received by the British, either at a military outpost or aboard British ships; those seeking sanctuary could enter His Majesty's forces, or go \\"as free settlers to the British possessions in North America or the West Indies\\".The text of the proclamation has been widely published, and copies of the printed original are in UK National Archives WO 1/143 f31 and ADM 1/508 f579.Morriss, p. 98.William S. Dudley, editor The Naval War of 1812: A Documentary History Volume II. (Naval Historical Center: Washington, DC 1992), 324‚Äì325. Among those who went to the British, some joined the Corps of Colonial Marines, an auxiliary unit of marine infantry, embodied on May 14, 1814. British commanders later stated the new marines fought well at Bladensburg and confirm that two companies took part in the burning of Washington including the White House. Following the Treaty of Ghent, the British kept their promise and in 1815 evacuated the Colonial Marines and their families to Halifax Canada and Bermuda.Alan Taylor, The Internal Enemy Slavery and War In Virginia. 1772‚Äì1832 (WW Norton & Company: New York, 2013), pp. 300‚Äì305 and Appendix B.  1815 to 1840  From the Treaty of Ghent to the Mexican-American War, African Americans made up a significant part of the peacetime navy. Data for 1839 was collected by Commodore Lewis Warrington and forwarded to the Secretary of the Navy as a memorandum with the number of recruits from 1 September 1838 to September 17, 1839. This document provides data for five naval recruiting stations which in total reflect 1016 men entered or naval service, \\"of which 122 were Black\\" or 12% of the total.Sharp, John G., The Recruitment of African Americans in the U.S. Navy 1839, Naval History and Heritage Command 2019. Retrieved March 6, 2019.  Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War  A number of African Americans in the Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War were servants of the officers who received government compensation for the services of their servants or slaves. Also, soldiers from the Louisiana Battalion of Free Men of Color participated in this war. African Americans also served on a number of naval vessels during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, including the USS Treasure, and the USS Columbus.  American Civil War  USCT The history of African Americans in the U.S. Civil War is marked by 186,097 (7,122 officers, 178,975 enlisted)Herbert Aptheker \\"Negro Casualties in the Civil War\\" The Journal of Negro History, Vol. 32, No. 1 (January 1947), p. 12. African-American men, comprising 163 units, who served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and many more African Americans served in the Union Navy. Both free African Americans and runaway slaves joined the fight. On the Confederate side, blacks, both free and slave, were used for labor. In the final months of the war, the Confederate Army was desperate for additional soldiers so the Confederate Congress voted to recruit black troops for combat; they were to be promised their freedom. Units were in training when the war ended, and none served in combat.Bruce Levine, Confederate Emancipation: Southern Plans to Free and Arm Slaves during the Civil War (2005). *54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment  Indian Wars  Buffalo Soldiers of the 25th Infantry Regiment, 1890 From 1863 to the early 20th century, African-American units were utilized by the Army to combat the Native Americans during the Indian Wars.William H. Leckie and Shirley A. Leckie, The Buffalo Soldiers: A Narrative of the Black Cavalry in the West (University of Oklahoma Press, 2012). The most noted among this group were the Buffalo Soldiers: * 9th Cavalry Regiment * 10th Cavalry Regiment * 24th Infantry Regiment * 25th Infantry Regiment At the end of the U.S. Civil War the army reorganized and authorized the formation of two regiments of black cavalry (the 9th and 10th US Cavalry). Four regiments of infantry (the 38th, 39th, 40th and 41st US Infantry) were formed at the same time. In 1869, the four infantry regiments were merged into two new ones (the 24th and 25th US Infantry). These units were composed of black enlisted men commanded by white officers such as Benjamin Grierson, and occasionally, an African-American officer such as Henry O. Flipper. The \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" served a variety of roles along the frontier from building roads to guarding the U.S. mail.Charles L. Kenner, Buffalo Soerldiers and Officers of the Ninth Cavalry, 1867‚Äì1898: Black and White Together, University of Oklahoma Press, 2014. These regiments served at a variety of posts in the southwest United States and Great Plains regions. During this period they participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record. Thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these four regiments earned the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars.Frank N. Schubert, Black Valor: Buffalo Soldiers and the Medal of Honor, 1870‚Äì1898 (1997).  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  Segregated company during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War; Camp Wikoff 1898 Tenth Dragoons exercise in Cuba After the Indian Wars ended in the 1890s, the regiments continued to serve and participated in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (including the Battle of San Juan Hill), where five more Medals of Honor were earned. They took part in the 1916 Punitive Expedition into Mexico and in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. = Units = In addition to the African Americans who served in regular army units during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, five African-American Volunteer Army units and seven African-American National Guard units served. Volunteer Army: * 7th United States Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 8th United States Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 9th United States Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 10th United States Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 11th United States Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) National Guard: * 3rd Alabama Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 8th Illinois Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * Companies A and B, 1st Indiana Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 23rd Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 3rd North Carolina Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 9th Ohio Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) * 6th Virginia Volunteer Infantry (Colored Troops) Of these units, only the 9th U.S., 8th Illinois, and 23rd Kansas served outside the United States during the war. All three units served in Cuba and suffered no losses to combat.  Philippine-American War  After the Treaty of Paris, the islands of the Philippines became a colony of the United States. When the U.S. military started to send soldiers into the islands, native rebels, who had already been fighting their former Spanish rulers, opposed U.S. colonization and retaliated, causing an insurrection. In what would be known as the Philippine-American War, the U.S. military also sent colored regiments and units to stop the insurrection. However, due to the discrimination of African- American soldiers, some of them defected to the Philippine Army. One of those that defected was David Fagen, who was given the rank of captain in the Philippine Army. Fagen served in the 24th Regiment of the U.S. Army, but on November 17, 1899, he defected to the Filipino army. He became a successful guerrilla leader and his capture became an obsession to the U.S. military and American public. His defection was likely the result of differential treatment by American occupational forces toward black soldiers, as well as common American forces derogatory treatment and views of the Filipino occupational resistance, who were frequently referred to as \\"niggers\\" and \\"gugus\\". After two other black deserters were captured and executed, President Theodore Roosevelt announced he would stop executing captured deserters. As the war ended, the US gave amnesties to most of their opponents. A substantial reward was offered for Fagen, who was considered a traitor. There are two conflicting versions of his fate: one is that his was the partially decomposed head for which the reward was claimed, the other is that he took a local wife and lived peacefully in the mountains.  World War I  366th Infantry Regiment returning home from World War I service. 369th (15th N.Y.) who won the Croix de Guerre for gallantry in action, 1919 When the war broke out, several African-American Americans joined Allied armies. Most notably, Eugene Bullard and Bob Scanlon joined the French Foreign Legion within weeks of the start of the war. Of the twelve African-Americans who joined the Legion at the start, only two survived the war. The U.S. armed forces remained segregated through World War I. Still, many African Americans volunteered to join the military following America's entry into the war. By the time of the armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918, over 200,000 African Americans had served with the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, while 170,000 remained in the United States. Most African-American units were largely relegated to support roles and did not see combat. Still, African Americans played a notable role in America's war effort. For example, the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the \\"Harlem Hellfighters\\", was assigned to the French Army and served on the front lines for six months. 171 members of the 369th were awarded the Legion of Merit. German propaganda targeting the African-American troops in WWI Germany attempted to sway the African American troops with propaganda challenging their race-related rights back in the United States. Corporal Freddie Stowers of the 371st Infantry Regiment that was seconded to the 157th French Army division called the Red Hand Division in need of reinforcement under the command of the General Mariano Goybet was posthumously awarded a Medal of Honor‚Äîthe only African American to be so honored for actions in World War I. During action in France, Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died from his wounds, but his men continued the fight and eventually defeated the German troops. Stowers was recommended for the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but the nomination was, according to the Army, misplaced. In 1990, under pressure from Congress, the Department of the Army launched an investigation. Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers. On April 24, 1991‚Äì73 years after he was killed in action‚ÄîStowers' two surviving sisters received the Medal of Honor from President George H. W. Bush at the White House. The success of the investigation leading to Stowers' Medal of Honor later sparked a similar review that resulted in six African Americans being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in World War II. Vernon Baker was the only recipient who was still alive to receive his award. = Units = Some of the African-American units that served in World War I were: Louisville * 92nd Infantry Division ** 366th Infantry Regiment * 93rd Infantry Division ** 369th Infantry Regiment (\\"Harlem Hellfighters\\"; formerly the 15th New York National Guard) ** 370th Infantry Regiment (\\"Black Devils\\", formerly the 8th Illinois) ** 371st Infantry Regiment ** 372nd Infantry Regiment Support units included: * Butchery Companies, Nos. 322 and 363 * Stevedore Regiments, Nos. 301, 302 and 303d Stevedore Regiment and Stevedore Battalions, Nos. 701, 702 * Army Corps of Engineers: Engineers Service Battalions, Nos. 505 to 567, inclusive (but skipping 531‚Äì532, 538, 537‚Äì563) (57 total; about 1008 personnel per battalion) * Labor Battalions, Nos. 304 to 315, inclusive; Nos. 317 to 327, inclusive; Nos. 329 to 348, inclusive, and No. 357 * Labor Companies, Nos. 301 to 324, inclusive * Pioneer Infantry Battalions, Nos. 801 to 809, inclusive; No. 811 and Nos. 813 to 816, inclusive. A complete list of African-American units that served in the war is published in the book Willing Patriots: Men of Color in World War One. The book is cited in the \\"Further reading\\" section of this article. African Americans Veterans faced heavy persecution when they returned home from World War I and many African American veterans were lynched after returning from WWI.  Period between the world wars  Even though the U.S. government was nominally neutral in the wars waged by Fascists against Ethiopia and Fascists and Nazis against the Spanish Republic in the mid-1930s, African Americans found it hard to be neutral and many became Antifascist.African Americans in the Spanish Civil War: \\"This Ain't Ethiopia, But It'll Do.\\" Edited by Danny Duncan Collum. Victor A. Berch, chief researcher. New York: G.K. Hall and Co., 1992. = Second Italo-Abyssinian War = On October 4, 1935, Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia. Being the only non-colonized African country besides Liberia, the invasion of Ethiopia caused a profound response amongst African Americans.Aric Putnam \\"Ethiopia is Now: J. A. Rogers and the Rhetoric of Black Anticolonialism During the Great Depression\\", Rhetoric & Public Affairs ‚Äì Volume 10, Number 3, Fall 2007, p. 419. African Americans organized to raise money for medical supplies, and many volunteered to fight for the African kingdom. Within eight months, however, Ethiopia was overpowered by the advanced weaponry and mustard gas of the Italian forces. Many years later Haile Selassie I would comment on the efforts: \\"We can never forget the help Ethiopia received from Negro Americans during the crisis. ... It moved me to know that Americans of African descent did not abandon their embattled brothers, but stood by us.\\" = Spanish Civil War = When General Franco rebelled against the newly established secular Spanish Republic, a number of African Americans volunteered to fight for Republican Spain. Many African Americans who were in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade had Communist ideals. Among these, there was Vaughn Love who went to fight for the Spanish loyalist cause because he considered Fascism to be the \\"enemy of all black aspirations.\\" African-American activist and World War I veteran Oliver Law, fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War James Peck was an African-American man from Pennsylvania who was turned down when he applied to become a military pilot in the US. He then went on to serve in the Spanish Republican Air Force until 1938. Peck was credited with shooting down five Aviaci√≥n Nacional planes, two Heinkel He-51s from the Legion Condor and three Fiat CR.32 Fascist Italian fighters. Salaria Kea was a young African-American nurse from Harlem Hospital who served as a military nurse with the American Medical Bureau in the Spanish Civil War. She was one of the two only African- American female volunteers in the midst of the war-torn Spanish Republican areas.Gail Lumet Buckley, American Patriots: The Story of Blacks in the Military from the Revolution to Desert Storm, When Salaria came back from Spain she wrote the pamphlet \\"A Negro Nurse in Spain\\" and tried to raise funds for the beleaguered Spanish Republic.  World War II  Despite a high enlistment rate in the U.S. Army, African Americans were not treated equally. At parades, church services, in transportation and canteens the races were kept separate. A quota of only 48 nurses was set for African-American women, and the women were segregated from white nurses and white soldiers for much of the war. Eventually more black nurses enlisted. They were assigned to care for black soldiers. Black nurses were integrated into everyday life with their white colleagues. Phyllis Mae Dailey was sworn into the United States Navy Nurse Corps as the first African-American servicewoman in World War II. The first African-American woman sworn into the Navy Nurse Corps was Phyllis Mae Dailey, a Columbia University student from New York. She was the first of only four African-American women to serve as a Navy nurse during World War II. Many soldiers of color served their country with distinction during World War II. There were 125,000 African Americans who were overseas in World War II (6.25% of all abroad soldiers). Famous segregated units, such as the Tuskegee Airmen and 761st Tank Battalion and the lesser-known but equally distinguished 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, proved their value in combat, leading to desegregation of all U.S. armed forces by order of President Harry S. Truman in July 1948 via Executive Order 9981. Battery A of the 452nd AAA Battalion, November 9, 1944 Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. served as commander of the Tuskegee Airmen during the war. He later went on to become the first African-American general in the United States Air Force. His father, Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., had been the first African-American brigadier general in the Army (1940). Admiral Chester W. Nimitz pins Navy Cross on Doris Miller, at ceremony on board warship in Pearl Harbor, May 27, 1942 Doris Miller, a Navy mess attendant, was the first African-American recipient of the Navy Cross, awarded for his actions during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Miller had voluntarily manned an anti-aircraft gun and fired at the Japanese aircraft, despite having no prior training in the weapon's use. On April 14, 1943, Joseph C. Jenkins became the first African-American commissioned officer in the United States Coast Guard. He was joined first by Clarence Samuels on August 31, 1943 and then by Harvey C. Russell Jr. in February 1944. In March 1944, the Golden Thirteen became the Navy's first African-American commissioned officers. Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. became a commissioned officer the same year; he would later be the first African American to command a US warship, and the first to be an admiral. The Port Chicago disaster on July 17, 1944, was an explosion of about 2,000 tons of ammunition as it was being loaded onto ships by black Navy sailors under pressure from their white officers to hurry. The explosion in Northern California killed 320 military and civilian workers, most of them black. It led a month later to the Port Chicago Mutiny, the only case of a full military trial for mutiny in the history of the U.S. Navy against 50 African-American sailors who refused to continue loading ammunition under the same dangerous conditions. The trial was observed by the then young lawyer Thurgood Marshall and ended in conviction of all of the defendants. The trial was immediately and later criticized for not abiding by the applicable laws on mutiny, and it became influential in the discussion of desegregation.http://www.sarahsundin.com/port-chicago-the-mutiny-trial-2/ During World War II, African-American soldiers served in all fields of service. In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, General Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing all-white companies. Consequently, he made the decision to allow 2000 black servicemen volunteers to serve in segregated platoons under the command of white lieutenants to replenish these companies. These platoons would serve with distinction and, according to an Army survey in the summer of 1945, 84% were ranked \\"very well\\" and 16% were ranked \\"fairly well\\". No black platoon received a ranking of \\"poor\\" by those white officers or white soldiers that fought with them. These platoons were often subject to racist treatment by white military units in occupied Germany and were quickly sent back to their old segregated units after the end of hostilities in Germany. Despite their protests, these brave African-American soldiers ended the war in their old non-combat service units. Though largely forgotten after the war, the temporary experiment with black combat troops proved a success - a small, but important step toward permanent integration during the Korean War. A total of 708 African Americans were killed in combat during World War II.Michael Clodfelter. Warfare and Armed Conflicts- A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500‚Äì2000. 2nd Ed. 2002 . In 1945, Frederick C. Branch became the first African-American United States Marine Corps officer.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two CBs that were \\"colored\\" units, the 34th and 80th. Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers. The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made national news. The Commander of the 80th had 19 enlisted dishonorably discharged for sedition. The NAACP and Thurgood Marshall got 14 of those reversed. In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored. The proposal was approved, but not acted on. The lack of stevedores in combat zones was a huge issue for the Navy. Authorization for the formation of cargo handling CBs or \\"Special CBs\\" happened mid-September 1942.This week in Seabee History, Sept 17‚Äì23, Seabee Online Magazine, NAVFAC Engineering Command, Wash. Navy Yard, DC. live.mil/326-2/ By wars end 41 Special CBs had been commissioned of which 15 were \\"colored\\". They were the first fully integrated units in the U.S. Navy. V-J Day brought the decommissioning of all of them. The Special CBs were forerunners of today's Navy Cargo Handling Battalions of the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group (United States). The arrival of 15 colored Special CBs in Pearl Harbor made segregation an issue for the Navy.Historical Content Significance, Naval Aviation Supply Depot Hut 33 at Waiawa Gulch, Peral City, U.S. Dept of Interior, Nat. Park Service, p. 10 For some time the men slept in tents, but the disparity of treatment was obvious even to the Navy. The 14th Naval District felt they deserved proper shelter with at least separate but equal barracks. Manana Barracks and Waiawa Gulch became the United State's largest colored military installation with over 4,000 Seabee stevedores housed there. It was the site of racial strife to the point that the camp was fenced in and placed under armed guard. The Seabees would be trucked back and forth to the docks in cattle trucks. Two naval supply depots were located at Waiawa Gulch. Of note were the actions of the 17th Special Naval Construction Battalion and the 16th Marine Field Depot on Peleliu, September 15‚Äì18, 1944. On D-Day the 7th Marines were in a situation where there were not enough of them to man the lines and get the wounded to safety. Coming to their aid were the two companies of the 16 Marine Field Depot(segregated) and the 17th Special Seabee (segregated). That night the Japanese mounted a counter-attack at 0200 hours. The Field Depot Marines are recorded as again having humped ammunition, to the front lines on the stretchers they brought the wounded back on and picked up rifles to become infantrymen. By the time it was over nearly the entire 17th CB had volunteered alongside them. The Seabee record states that besides humping ammo and helping wounded they volunteered to man the line where the wounded had been, man 37mm that had lost their crews and volunteered for anything dangerous. The 17th remained with the 7th Marines until the right flank had been secured D-plus 3.Princeton University Library, Marine Corps Chevron, Vol 3 Number 48, December 2, 1944 According to the Military History Encyclopedia on the Web, were it not for the \\"Black Marine shore party personal\\" the counterattack on the 7th Marines would not have been repulsed.Peleliu, battle for (Operation Stalemate II) ‚Äì The Pacific War's Forgotten Battle, September‚ÄìNovember 1944, (section: Hitting the Beach, 3rd paragraph), Military History Encyclopedia on the Web, by: Peter D Antill, Tristan Dugdale-Pointon, and Dr John Rickard, *On Peleliu, the white shore party detachments from the 33rd and 73rd CBs received Presidential Unit Citations along with the primary shore party, 1st Marine Pioneers.1st Marine Pioneers, PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION, First Marine Division, Reinforced, Assault and seizure of Peleliu and Ngesebus, Palau Islands, Part II.

Feb 7 2018 = Medal of Honor recipients = On January 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton, in a White House ceremony, awarded the nation's highest military honor‚Äîthe Medal of Honor‚Äîto seven African-American servicemen who had served in World War II. The only living recipient was First Lieutenant Vernon Baker. The posthumous recipients were: * Major Charles L. Thomas * First Lieutenant John R. Fox * Staff Sergeant Ruben Rivers * Staff Sergeant Edward A. Carter, Jr. Carter also has a Military Sealift Command vessel named after him. * Private First Class Willy F. James, Jr. * Private George Watson = Blue discharges = African-American troops faced discrimination in the form of the disproportionate issuance of blue discharges. The blue discharge (also called a \\"blue ticket\\") was a form of administrative discharge created in 1916 to replace two previous discharge classifications, the administrative discharge without honor and the \\"unclassified\\" discharge. It was neither honorable nor dishonorable.Jones, p. 2. Of the 48,603 blue discharges issued by the Army between December 1, 1941, and June 30, 1945, 10,806 were issued to African Americans. This accounts for 22.2% of all blue discharges, when African Americans made up 6.5% of the Army in that time frame.McGuire, p. 146. Blue discharge recipients frequently faced difficulties obtaining employmentShilts, p. 164. and were routinely denied the benefits of the G. I. Bill by the Veterans Administration (VA).B√©rub√©, p. 230. In October 1945, Black-interest newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier launched a crusade against the discharge and its abuses. Calling the discharge \\"a vicious instrument that should not be perpetrated against the American Soldier\\", the Courier rebuked the Army for \\"allowing prejudiced officers to use it as a means of punishing Negro soldiers who do not like specifically unbearable conditions\\". The Courier printed instructions on how to appeal a blue discharge and warned its readers not to quickly accept a blue ticket out of the service because of the negative effect it would likely have on their lives.B√©rub√©, p. 241. The House Committee on Military Affairs held hearings in response to the press crusade, issuing a report in 1946 that sharply criticized its use and the VA for discriminating against blue discharge holders.B√©rub√©, p. 234. Congress discontinued the blue discharge in 1947, but the VA continued its practice of denying G. I. Bill benefits to blue-tickets.  Integration of the armed forces  On July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 integrating the military and mandating equality of treatment and opportunity. It also made it illegal, per military law, to make a racist remark. Desegregation of the military was not complete for several years, and all-black Army units persisted well into the Korean War. The last all-black unit was not disbanded until 1954. In 1950, Lieutenant Leon Gilbert of the still-segregated 24th Infantry Regiment was court martialed and sentenced to death for refusing to obey the orders of a white officer while serving in the Korean War. Gilbert maintained that the orders would have meant certain death for himself and the men in his command. The case led to worldwide protests and increased attention to segregation and racism in the U.S. military. Gilbert's sentence was commuted to twenty and later seventeen years of imprisonment; he served five years and was released. The integration commanded by Truman's 1948 Executive Order extended to schools and neighborhoods as well as military units. Fifteen years after the Executive Order, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara issued Department of Defense Directive 5120.36. \\"Every military commander\\", the Directive mandates, \\"has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may gather in off-duty hours.\\"Department of Defense Directive 5120.36 While the directive was issued in 1963, it was not until 1967 that the first non-military establishment was declared off-limits. In 1970 the requirement that commanding officers first obtain permission from the Secretary of Defense was lifted, and areas were allowed to be declared housing areas off limits to military personnel by their commanding officer.Heather Antecol and Deborah Cobb-Clark, Racial and Ethnic Harassment in Local Communities. October 4, 2005. p 8 Since the end of military segregation and the creation of an all-volunteer army, the American military saw the representation of African Americans in its ranks rise dramatically.John Sibley Butler. \\"Affirmative Action in the Military Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science\\", Vol. 523, Affirmative Action Revisited (September 1992), p. 196.  Korean War  African-American prisoners of war in Korea in 1950. Jesse L. Brown became the U.S. Navy's first black aviator in October 1948. He died when his plane was shot down during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. He was unable to parachute from his crippled F4U Corsair and crash-landed successfully. His injuries and damage to his aircraft prevented him from leaving the plane. A white squadron mate, Thomas Hudner, crash-landed his F4U Corsair near Brown and attempted to extricate Brown but could not and Brown died of his injuries. Hudner was awarded the Medal of Honor for his efforts. The U.S. Navy honored Jesse Brown by naming a frigate after him‚Äîthe USS Jesse L. Brown (FF-1089). Two enlisted men from the 24th Infantry Regiment (still a segregated unit), Cornelius H. Charlton and William Thompson, posthumously received the Medal of Honor for actions during the war. U.S president Harry Truman decided to desegregate the armed forces on July 26, 1948. Truman believed that passing this order would help end racial discrimination. After two years went by North Korea invaded South Korea and the United States decided to send African Americans troopers over also. The war was very difficult for African American soldiers because they didn‚Äôt get a lot of respect from their comrades. In 1950, the American military arrested fifty members of all-black 24th infantry and falsely accused them of AWOL and cowardice in the presence of the enemy. Even though Harry Truman signed this executive order for desegregation in the armed forces, African Americans still had to come over other obstacles like falsely being accused and charged with actions they never committed while they were in active duty. Black companies were already miss-treated and when they came across an actual battle the results were devastating. 300,000 Chinese troops stormed across the Yalu River on November 24, 1950, and the 503rd Battalion found themselves directly in the line of fire. Since the all-black battalion wasn‚Äôt getting treated fairly and didn‚Äôt get the correct amount of supplies every other company got to fight back they lost the battle. Many were killed and many were locked up in a Chinese prison. The conditions in these prisons were cold and not enough food. The African American soldiers spent up to three years in the prisons. The reason for this was because the Chinese captors believed that African Americans were particularly vulnerable to anti-American propaganda because of the discrimination they faced back home and in their units. As a result, the Chinese subjected African Americans to anti-capitalist and anti-imperial brainwashing more than their white counterparts. African Americans were able to now fight in the wars but they still faced many acoustics and the Korean war was one of the hardest wars for an African American soldier fighting for his country. Through all this adversity about 600,000 African Americans served in the armed forces during the war and 5,000 lost their life in combat. Many were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star and Bronze Star.  Vietnam War  A U.S. soldier of 1st Battalion, 503rd U.S. Infantry battles for Hill 882, southwest of Dak To, November 1967 The Vietnam War saw many great accomplishments by many African Americans, including twenty who received the Medal of Honor for their actions. African Americans were over-represented in hazardous duty and combat roles during the conflict, and suffered disproportionately higher casualty rates. Civil-rights leaders protested this disparity during the early years of the war, prompting reforms that were implemented in 1967‚Äì68 resulting in the casualty rate dropping to slightly higher than their percentage of the total population.War within war; The Guardian; September 15, 2001Working-Class War: American Combat Soldiers and Vietnam: American Combat; Christian G. Appy; University of North Carolina Press; p. 19.Fighting on Two Fronts: African Americans and the Vietnam War; Westheider, James E.; New York University Press; 1997; pp. 11‚Äì16.African- Americans In Combat In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented the Medal of Honor to U.S. Army Specialist Five Lawrence Joel, for a \\"very special kind of courage‚Äîthe unarmed heroism of compassion and service to others.\\" Joel was the first living African American to receive the Medal of Honor since the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was a medic who in 1965 saved the lives of U.S. troops under ambush in Vietnam and defied direct orders to stay to the ground, walking through Viet Cong gunfire and tending to the troops despite being shot twice himself. The Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is dedicated to his honor. On August 21, 1968, with the posthumous award of the Medal of Honor, U.S. Marine James Anderson, Jr. became the first African-American U.S. Marine recipient of the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions and sacrifice of life. On December 10, 1968, U.S. Army Captain Riley Leroy Pitts became the first African-American commissioned officer to be awarded the Medal of Honor. His medal was presented posthumously to his wife, Eula Pitts, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Three out of the 21 African- American Medal of Honor recipients who served in Vietnam were members of the 5th Special Forces Group otherwise known as The Green Berets. These men are as follows: Sergeant First Class Melvin Morris, SFC. Eugene Ashley, Jr., and SFC. William Maud Bryant. Melvin Morris received the Medal of Honor 44 years after the action in which he earned the Distinguished Service Cross. Sergeant Ashley's medal was posthumously awarded to his family at the White House by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew on December 2, 1969.  Post-Vietnam to present day  General Colin Powell briefs President George H. W. Bush and his advisors on the progress of the Gulf War In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Army General Colin Powell to the position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making Powell the highest-ranking officer in the United States military. Powell was the first, and is so far the only, African American to hold that position. The Chairman serves as the chief military adviser to the President and the Secretary of Defense. During his tenure Powell oversaw the 1989 United States invasion of Panama to oust General Manuel Noriega and the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. General Powell's four-year term as Chairman ended in 1993. General William E. \\"Kip\\" Ward was officially nominated as the first commander of the new United States Africa Command on July 10, 2007 and assumed command on October 1, 2007. Ronald L. Green, former Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, is African-American. On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated as President of the United States, making him ex officio the first African-American Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. On August 6, 2020, Charles Q. Brown Jr. became the first African-American chief of a United States military service branch, when he took over as Chief of Staff of the Air Force.

The village has one public house, The Agar Arms, and a Church of England primary school (established in 1863), with about forty pupils. Warthill is home to St Mary's Church, which was built in the 19th century and is a good example of Victorian Gothic architecture. Brockfield Hall, a Georgian house completed in 1807, is situated nearby. It was built for Benjamin Agar by Peter Atkinson senior who worked in the office of John Carr (architect). Brockfield has an oval entry hall with cantilevered staircase. The house displays fine art and furniture, and mementos associated with the Fitzalan Howard family. There is also an unusual collection of glass walking sticks. The house is rectangular in plan, with a hipped slate roof. The most immediately noticeable feature is a large Venetian window on the first floor which is set in a semi-circular arch of stone panels.

His famous compositions for Love include \\"Alone Again Or,\\" \\"Old Man,\\" and \\"Orange Skies.\\" Biography =Early life= Bryan MacLean's mother was an artist and a dancer, and his father was an architect for Hollywood celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor and Dean Martin. Neighbor Frederick Loewe, of the songwriting team Lerner & Loewe, recognized him as a \\"melodic genius\\" at the age of three as he doodled on the piano. His early influences were Billie Holiday and George Gershwin, although he confessed to an obsession with Elvis Presley. During his childhood, he wore out show music records from Guys and Dolls, Oklahoma, South Pacific and West Side Story. His first girlfriend was Liza Minnelli and they would sit at the piano together singing songs from The Wizard of Oz. He learned to swim in Elizabeth Taylor's pool, and his father's good friend was actor Robert Stack. Bryan appears in the 1957 Cary Grant film An Affair to Remember singing in the Deborah Kerr character's music class. Maria McKee is his half-sister. At 17, Bryan heard The Beatles: \\"Before the Beatles I had been into folk music. I had wanted to be an artist in the bohemian tradition, where we would sit around with banjos and do folk music, but when I saw A Hard Day's Night everything changed. I let my hair grow out and I got kicked out of high school.\\" =Early music career= Bryan started playing guitar professionally in 1963. He got a job at the Balladeer in West Hollywood playing folk and blues guitar. The following year, the club changed its name to the Troubadour. His regular set routine was a mixture between Appalachian folk songs and delta blues, and he also frequently covered Robert Johnson's \\"Cross Road Blues.\\" It was there he met the founding musicians of The Byrds, Gene Clark and Jim McGuinn, when they were rehearsing as a duo. Bryan became good friends with David Crosby. During that time, Bryan also became friends with songwriter Sharon Sheeley, who fixed him up on his first date with singer Jackie De Shannon. With MacLean as equipment manager, the Byrds went on the road to promote their first single \\"Mr. Tambourine Man.\\" By the time the Byrds left for their first UK tour, MacLean was left behind and very disappointed. After an unsuccessful audition for a role in The Monkees, Bryan got into a car on the Sunset Strip that Arthur Lee was driving. Lee‚Äôs band, the Grass Roots (not to be confused with the popular rock band of the same name), was the house band at a club called the Brave New World. Lee knew that the colorful dancers and the scene that had followed the Byrds would follow Bryan, if Bryan joined his band, so Lee took Bryan to sit in with them at The Brave New World. =The Grass Roots= The members of the Grass Roots were Arthur Lee (vocals, harmonica, guitar, keyboards, drums), Johnny Echols (lead guitar, vocals), Johnny Fleckenstein (bass), Don Conka (drums), and Bryan MacLean (rhythm guitar, vocals). Despite the success of Lee and the others at the Los Angeles club, another Los Angeles band led by P. F. Sloan was first to record under the name The Grass Roots, which spurred Lee to change the name of his band to Love. =Love= Jac Holzman's Elektra Records signed Love, and they had a minor hit with their version of the Bacharach/David tune \\"My Little Red Book\\" and released their debut album Love to which Bryan contributed the melodic \\"Softly to Me,\\" as well as co-writing two other songs. He also contributed The Byrds' arrangement of \\"Hey Joe,\\" which he performed live, and sang the lead vocal on the record. In 1966, Love hit #33 on the US national chart with their proto-punk single \\"7 and 7 Is,\\" followed by their second album, in November 1966 Da Capo, featuring MacLean‚Äôs critically acclaimed \\"Orange Skies.\\" Despite their early success, by mid-1967 the 'classic' lineup was already falling apart, due to a combination of factors including internal tensions, complacency, lack of rehearsals, drug use, the growing creative rivalry between Lee and MacLean (MacLean was increasingly unhappy with Lee's domination of the songwriting) and Lee's refusal to tour or travel to promote their records. However, this lineup held together long enough to create their third (and final) album, Forever Changes, which is considered one of the finest rock albums ever, reaching #40 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the top 500 albums of all time, #6 on the NME 's (New Music Express's) 100 Best Albums Of All Time (2003) and #11 on Virgin's All-Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). It was entered into the National Recording Registry in May 2012. Much of the credit for the completion of Forever Changes is due to co-producer Bruce Botnick. After early sessions stalled due to the group's lack of rehearsal and preparation, Botnik hired in several members of legendary L.A. session cohort \\"The Wrecking Crew\\" to record with Lee and MacLean on two tracks - a tactic that effectively 'shocked' the group's recalcitrant rhythm section back into action, and after a brief period of intensive rehearsals, they returned to the studio and completed the remaining cuts for the album in just 64 hours. MacLean‚Äôs \\"Alone Again Or\\" is the opening track with Arthur Lee providing co-lead vocals. \\"Alone Again Or\\" was the sole single released from the album to appear on the Billboard singles chart (its B-side was Lee's \\"A House Is Not A Motel\\"). A remixed mono version of \\"Alone Again Or\\" was released as a promo single by Elektra in 1970. \\"Alone Again Or\\" initially peaked at #123 in 1968 in an edited version, while the longer, original album version spent three weeks on the singles chart in 1970 before peaking at #99, according to Whitburn's \\"Top Pop Singles: 1955-2010.\\" In 2010, \\"Alone Again Or\\" came in at #442 in a poll of the 500 greatest songs of all time conducted by Rolling Stone magazine (it was #436 in the 2004 poll). It had since been covered by many notable acts including UFO, Calexico, and The Damned. =Spiritual conversion and solo music career= Bryan was offered a solo contract with Elektra after the dissolution of Love, but his demo offerings were rejected by the label, and the contract lapsed. Subsequently, he wrote a film score that was not used. Thereafter he tried without success to record an album for Capitol records in New York. \\"I was alone in a hotel room in New York and I had lost practically everything,\\" Bryan was quoted as saying. \\"It occurred to me that I was in a tail-spin so I thought 'well, why don't I pray?' So I did, and nothing happened for about two or three weeks. At the end of that time, I was sitting in a drug store on 3rd Avenue having a drink, and suddenly the drink turned to sand in my mouth. I left the bar and when I reached the pavement and the daylight I knew something had changed. From that point on my life has been totally different.‚Äù Bryan joined a Christian ministry called the Vineyard, the same church that later converted Bob Dylan. During Friday night Bible readings, MacLean took the concert part of the session and was so amazed at the positive reaction he received that he gradually assembled a catalogue of his Christian songs. His next move was to open a Christian nightclub in Beverly Hills called The Daisy. When it closed in 1976, MacLean considered going full-time into the ministry but decided once again to devote himself to music. He played an unsuccessful reunion with Arthur Lee in 1978 on two dates but wasn't paid, so he turned down an offer for a UK tour which was to have been billed as the \\"original\\" Love. The Bryan MacLean Band got a gig supporting Arthur Lee's Love at the Whisky in 1982. Bryan also worked with his half sister Maria McKee and wrote the song \\"Don't Toss Us Away\\" for the debut album of her band Lone Justice. In about 1996, his Elektra Records demo tapes were discovered by his mother Elizabeth in the family garage, and after two years of persistent shopping around record companies, a deal was struck with Sundazed, who in 1997 released the CD Ifyoubelievein. \\"(It's), in a sense, the Love record that never was: solo demos and home recordings of fourteen original MacLean songs, all written in the earliest and most vital years of Love and all but three virtually unheard in any form since MacLean wrote them,\\" said David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine. In the album's liner notes, MacLean adds, \\"The music that is presented in this collection was written decades ago, when I was in the band Love, and was written with that band in mind, and had been intended to be performed by, and associated with the band, Love. I firmly believe that if things had been the other way around, by now, you probably would've already heard a great deal, if not all of what is assembled here. For one thing, I would've stuck around the band a lot longer, not feeling the frustration of having such a backlog of unpublished, and unperformed material, and the natural unfulfilled desire for recognition, or even vindication.\\" MacLean then completed a spiritual album of Christian music and was about to record another album when he died of a heart attack in a Los Angeles area restaurant on Christmas Day 1998.

The stars of the film include famous Soviet actors such as Savely Kramarov, Yevgeny Leonov, Georgy Vitsin, and Radner Muratov. The film was the leader of Soviet distribution in 1972, drawing 65.02 million box office admissions. Plot summary The movie follows the story of an amiable kindergarten principal named Troshkin who looks exactly like a cruel criminal nicknamed Docent (–î–æ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç, literally associate professor) that has stolen Alexander the Great's helmet at an archaeological excavation. Docent and his gang are caught by police, but Docent is imprisoned in a different jail than his mates. Since Troshkin looks identical to Docent, the police send him undercover to prison with the real criminals to get information about the stolen helmet. He must pretend to be the real felon Docent, so in order to be convincing, Troshkin, a well-educated and good- natured man, has to learn slang and manners of criminals.

These parental involvement laws require that one or more parents consent or be informed before their minor daughter may legally have an abortion. Minors and abortion in law =Australia= A minor does not require parental consent or notification except in Western Australia, where in the event of the woman being under 16 years of age one of her parents must be notified, except where permission has been granted by the Children's Court or the woman does not live with her parents. =Canada= In Canada, abortion is subject to general medical legislation, as there are no laws regulating abortion. Access varies by province and by region; though there are no legal restrictions to abortion. Most medical facilities in Canada do not share medical information with a parent without consent of their child who is seeking an abortion. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that the woman's partner, the father of the baby, has no right to veto her decision to undergo an abortion. Abortion is funded by the government. =France= A pregnant girl under the age of 18 may ask for an abortion without consulting her parents first, but she has to be accompanied to the clinic by an adult of her choice. This adult must not tell her parents or any third party about the abortion.Abortion Guide pages 34 and 35, from the French Ministry of Health =Greece= Girls under the age of 18 must get written permission from a parent or guardian before being allowed an abortion. =India= Minor girls under 18 need parental consent. Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, abortion is permitted on liberal grounds until 20 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions after 20 weeks are illegal, but a court may authorize such a late abortion in exceptional circumstances. =Italy= Parental authorisation is required if the woman is under 18. =New Zealand= New Zealand has no parental notification restrictions on under-sixteen access for abortion. =Norway= Parental consent is required if the woman is under 16 years of age. =Poland= Parental consent is always required if the woman seeking abortion is a minor. =South Africa= In South Africa, any woman of any age can get an abortion on request with no reasons given if she is less than 13 weeks pregnant. A woman under the age of 18 will be advised to consult her parents, but she can decide not to inform or consult them if she so chooses.Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1996 (Act No. 92 of 1996) However, she must give informed consent, meaning that if she is unable to understand the consequences of an abortion she cannot consent to one without the assistance of her parents or guardian.Christian Lawyers Association v Minister of Health and Others (Reproductive Health Alliance as amicus curiae) 2005 (1) SA 509 (T) (24 May 2004), Transvaal Provincial Division =Spain= In 2009, the Socialist government passed a bill that states that people aged 16 and 17 must inform their parents (but does not need parental consent) to obtain an abortion except if the child comes from an abusive household and such news will cause more strife. =Sweden= The current legislation is the Abortion Act of 1974. This states that up until the end of the eighteenth week of the pregnancy the choice of an abortion is entirely up to the woman, for any reason whatsoever. The law makes no distinction with regards to the age of the pregnant woman. =United Kingdom= Parental involvement laws in the UK; if the girl is seen as competent by medical staff no disclosure to parents is allowed. In most cases, girls aged 13 or above will be covered by this provision but pre-teenagers will not and parents, social workers and police can become involved to protect the child. Around 120 12-year-olds, at least five 11-year-olds and two nine-year-olds have had legal abortions since 1996. In 2005, Sue Axon, of Manchester, wanted the law changed to prevent girls under 16 getting confidential advice. However, the High Court had rejected a review of guidelines which state that terminations do not need parents' consent and doctors should respect girls' confidentiality. =United States = left320pxthumbMap showing which states require parental notification. In the United States, most states typically require one of two types of parental involvement‚Äì consent or notification, or both. 37 states require parental involvement in a minor's decision to have an abortion (21 states require parental consent only, 3 of which require both parents to consent; 11 states require parental notification only, 1 of which requires that both parents be notified; 5 states require both parental consent and notification; 8 states require the parental consent documentation to be notarized). In Delaware the law only applies to minors under 16, and in South Carolina to minors under 17. Parental involvement laws played a key role in forcing the Court to clarify its position on abortion regulation. The Court ruled, in essence, that parental involvement laws (and all other abortion regulation) can legally make it more difficult for a female to acquire an abortion. But there is a threshold beyond which the increased difficulties become unconstitutional. Requiring spousal involvement before a woman can acquire an abortion has been interpreted as falling on the unconstitutional side of that threshold, while parental involvement has been interpreted as falling on the constitutional side. Or, to use the language of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992), spousal notification laws place an \\"undue burden\\" on a woman's ability to get an abortion, whereas parental involvement laws do not. Parental involvement laws have three basic features. First, they are binding on minors, not adults. Second, they require, at minimum, that minors notify their parents before an abortion is performed, and in some cases consent from the parents. And third, they allow minors to acquire a judicial bypass if consent cannot be acquired. These regulations are but one example of the detailed fabric of abortion legislation and regulation that has evolved since the Supreme Court's decision to legalize abortion in its 1973 Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. The first major case involving parental involvement legislation was decided in 1976 in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth. This case involved a Missouri law that required consent from various parties before an abortion could be performed‚Äì written consent by the patient, spousal consent for married individuals, and parental consent for minors, specifically. The court ruled that the parental consent provision was unconstitutional due to its universal enforcement. The ability of a minor to acquire an abortion against her parent's wishes became a recurring theme in several more cases following Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth. Bellotti v. Baird (1979) addressed a Massachusetts law that required a minor to acquire parental consent before an abortion was performed. But, unlike the Danforth case, this law allowed for judicial bypass if consent could not be acquired. Similar reasoning can be found in H.L. v. Matheson (1981). This case ruled on the relatively milder regulation of parental notification as opposed to parental consent. In this case, the Court ruled that parental notification is constitutional since the parent could not veto the adolescent's final decision to acquire an abortion. In Planned Parenthood of Kansas City v. Ashcroft (1983), the Supreme Court ruled that parental consent is constitutional so long as it also allowed a judicial bypass if such consent could not be acquired. In Planned Parenthood of S.E. Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992), the Court placed parental involvement firmly within a broader set of legal principles governing a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Parental involvement, and other regulations, were constitutional so long that they did not place an \\"undue burden\\" on a woman's ability to acquire an abortion. In Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts v. Attorney General (1997), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found the requirement of both parents consenting to the minor's abortion unconstitutional, but upheld the parental consent of one parent. In November 2011, the Illinois Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the state must begin enforcing a 1995 law requiring parental notification. The Court ultimately agreed in July 2013 that the law ought to be enforced, with the parental notification law taking effect on August 15. In American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren (1997) 16 Cal.4th 307 the Supreme Court of California struck down the 1987 parental consent law of the state (which had been enjoined shortly after enactment, and thus never enforced). This case also made history because it was one of the few cases in the legal history of California where its Supreme Court granted a rehearing of a legal case, after it had previously ruled in American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren (1996) 51 Cal.Rptr.2d 201 that the law was constitutional. In Illinois no parent needs to be involved at any time.

The girl was impregnated by her own stepfather, who had repeatedly raped her since she was six years old. The doctors recommended the abortion because they believed the girl's youth would prevent her from delivering the twins safely. The affair shocked the Brazilian government and provoked disgust from President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. Pope Benedict XVI later gave a controversial speech in Angola where he condemned all forms of abortion, even those considered to be therapeutic. Therapeutic abortion is the term for abortions that are typically performed to save the life of the mother or in which the fetus has been found to have a defect incompatible with life.Radio Vatican See also {width=100% -valign=top width=50% *Abortion debate *Abortion law *Age of consent *Conscience clause (medical) *Emancipation of minors *Mature minor doctrine width=50% *Gillick competence *Paternal rights and abortion *Legal protection of access to abortion *Teenage pregnancy *Teenage pregnancy and sexual health in the United Kingdom *Youth rights }  References   External links  In support *Why We Need The Child Custody Protection Act‚Äì NRLC *Analyzing the Effect of State Legislation on the Incidence of Abortion Among Minors‚Äì Heritage Foundation In opposition * Restrictions on Young Women's Access to Abortion‚Äì NARAL * Parenthood.org/news- articles-press/laws-requiring-parental-consent-of-notification-for-minors- abortions.htm Laws Requiring Parental Consent or Notification for Minors' Abortions‚Äì Planned Parenthood Neutral *HealthVote.org‚Äì Non-partisan Analysis of California's Proposition 85 (Parental Notification & Waiting Period for Minors' Abortions‚Äì November 2006 Election) Abortion Abortion debate Abortion law Family law Sex laws Youth rights ","title":"Minors and abortion"},{"id":"3504863","text":"CBCV-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts the programming of the CBC Radio One network in Victoria, British Columbia, and throughout Vancouver Island, the Southern Gulf Islands, and the Sunshine Coast. It also reaches out to parts of Washington north of Everett, Washington, but is harder to listen to because of KSER on 90.7. It was the most listened to radio station in the Victoria Market in the Fall 2018 Numeris Diary Survey.http://assets.numeris.ca/Downloads/2018_Fall_Radio_DI_TopLineReports.pdf History The station was licensed by the CRTC in 1997, and was launched in 1998. At the same time, the station was licensed to add a rebroadcaster at Metchosin, and took over 13 existing rebroadcasters of Vancouver's CBU. Prior to the station's launch, Victoria was the only provincial capital in Canada without its own CBC Radio production centre. As of January 25, 2013, the station shares its studio facilities with independent television station CHEK- DT. Local programming The station's local programs are On the Island (hosted by Gregor Craigie) in the morning and All Points West (hosted by Robyn Burns) in the afternoon. Both programs broadcast exclusively on CBCV and its rebroadcasters on Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast. Transmitters The only major city on Vancouver Island without its own CBC Radio transmitter is Nanaimo. CBCV's signal on 90.5 MHz from Victoria only reaches as far north as Ladysmith, and its signal on 92.5 MHz from Powell River as received in the Nanaimo area interferes with KQMV from Seattle. Consequently, the only CBC Radio One signals that can be reliably received in the Nanaimo area are from CBU Vancouver, which air weekday morning and afternoon local programs from Vancouver instead of Victoria. The CBC applied to the CRTC to add a rebroadcaster of CBCV at Nanaimo in 2007, contemporaneous with an application to convert the Vancouver station to FM. As few FM frequencies remain available in the Vancouver-Victoria market, however, the applications were denied. CBU was permitted to add a nested low-power rebroadcaster in the urban core of Vancouver, but was required to maintain the AM signal to serve outlying areas, including Nanaimo. On October 20, 2015 the CRTC approved the CBC's application to operate a low-power FM rebroadcasting transmitter in Ucluelet, which will operate at 92.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 50 watts. The transmitter replaced the AM transmitter, CBXQ. On March 9, 2016, the CBC received CRTC approval to change the technical parameters of CBRY by changing the transmitter's class from A1 to A, by increasing the effective radiated power from 77 to 360 watts and by increasing the effective height of antenna above average terrain from -50.5 to -41.5 metres. On December 22, 2016, the CBC applied to convert CBUX 1170 to 92.3 MHz with the proposed callsign CBCV- FM-2. The CRTC approved the CBC's application on March 17, 2017.

History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Hottune in the Bulford hundred. Before the Norman invasion the manor was shared between Sprot and Gospatric, son of Arnketil. Afterwards they were split between the Crown and Hugh, son Baldric who installed Wulfbert of Hutton as lord of the manor. The latter part of the manor passed eventually to the Mowbray family until 1604 when the title became unused. The other part of the manor was in the possession of the Percy family of Kildale in the early 13th century. Other families that had possession included the Grays of York and the Thwaite family. The manor was once owned by an eccentric Englishman, Sir Robert Walker, Bt. He had his own narrow gauge steam railway, which provided transport around his large estate, and a fire brigade. The name is derived from Old English words hoh and -tun meaning a hill or spur of projecting land (hill) and settlement. The prefix Sand was added later to denote the type of soil in the area and distinguish it from other Huttons in the area. Governance The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It also lies within the Hovingham & Sheriff Hutton electoral ward of North Yorkshire County Council and the Ryedale South West ward of Ryedale District Council. The Parish Council has six members with representation split equally between the two villages of the Parish. Geography The village is located almost halfway between the A64 and A166 to the east of York. The nearest settlements are Claxton to the north and Upper Helmsley to the south. The 2001 UK Census, which separated the village records, recorded the population of Sand Hutton as 193, of which 158 were over sixteen years of age. There were 81 dwellings of which 54 were detached. By the time of the 2011 Census the population had increased to 213. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs's Food and Environment Research Agency is sited at Sand Hutton. Amenities There is a school, Sand Hutton CE Primary, which is in the catchment area of Huntington School in York for secondary education.

There is a community hall and is located in an area popular with shooting and other field sports.

It lies on the north bank of the River Ouse. History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Luctone in the Bulford hundred. The manor at this time was split between Thorfin of Ravensworth and Thorn of Linton. Afterwards the manor was granted to Robert of Mortain. The manor passed to Thomas de Ros, 4th Baron de Ros in the 14th century and remained in their family until the mid=16th century. At the beginning of the 18th century the manorial rights were sold to University College, Oxford, who built a school in the village in 1871. In the mid-18th century, Acts of Parliament were passed to make the River Ouse navigable. This included the building of a lock at Linton-on-Ouse that is now a Grade II Listed Building. There used to be a Catholic Chapel in the village between 1700 and 1855. Since 1937 Linton-on-Ouse has been home to a Royal Air Force station, RAF Linton-on-Ouse. Since 1957 the main role of the airfield has been the training of pilots.RAF Linton-on-Ouse In the summer of 1960 and 1961, the perimeter track of the airfield was used to form the 1.7mile Linton- on-Ouse Motor Racing circuit.

History The village was in existence at the time of the Norman invasion, as shown in the OpenDomesday on-line. In the 11th century it was known as Hipton from the Old English words heope and -tun, meaning Rose-hip settlement. Land in the area was held by Count Alan of Brittany around 1086 and by Richard de Camera. Various landowners over the next 150 years gave land to nearby St Mary's Abbey. After the dissolution, John Shipton had leased the manor which John Redman eventually bought from the Crown outright in 1557. By 1625 the manor had passed to William Scudamore of Overton, who eventually sold it the Bouchier family of nearby Beningbrough Hall and thence through succession to the Dawnay family. Community Centre In 1655, Ann Middleton, a Yorkshire philanthropist and wife of the Sheriff of York, left ¬£1,000 to build a grammar school in the village. She also left 20 shillings a year to the poor of Shipton. The grammar school stood until 1850, when the Lord of the Manor, the Hon. Payan Dawnay, knocked it down, and built a new one. The village public house was once known as The Bay Horse, and was originally built in 1730. It became The Dawnay Arms in Payan‚Äôs lifetime and shows the family coat of arms over the door. It is a Grade II Listed building. Land to the north of the village was used as an airfield (RAF Shipton) during the First World War. In the Second World War it was the base of a crashed aircraft recovery unit and then the site was used between 1953 and 1993 as a location for a government command and control bunker.

This method was first developed in the early 1980s combining innovations by a number of speed cubers. Czech speedcuber and the namesake of the method Jessica Fridrich is generally credited for popularizing it by publishing it online in 1997. The method works on a layer-by-layer system, first solving a cross typically on the bottom, continuing to solve the first two layers (F2L), orienting the last layer (OLL), and finally permuting the last layer (PLL). History Basic layer-by-layer methods were among the first to arise during the early 1980s cube craze. David Singmaster published a layer-based solution in 1980 which proposed the use of a cross. The major innovation of CFOP over beginner methods is its use of F2L, which solves the first two layers simultaneously. This step was not invented by Jessica Fridrich. According to Singmaster's report on the 1982 World Rubik's Cube Championship, Fridrich was then using a basic layer method, while Dutch competitor Guus Razoux Schultz had a primitive F2L system. The last layer steps OLL and PLL involve first orienting the last layer pieces, then permuting them into their correct positions. This step was proposed by Hans Dockhorn and Anneke Treep. Fridrich switched to F2L later in 1982. Her main contribution to the method was developing the OLL and PLL algorithms, which together allowed any last layer position to be solved with two algorithms and was significantly faster than previous last layer systems. CFOP, with small tweaks, is by far the most popular method that top cubers use. Users include Mats Valk, Feliks Zemdegs, and Max Park. The Method * The Cross ‚Äì This first stage involves solving the four edge pieces in one outer layer of the puzzle, centering around a commonly coloured centre piece. Many speedcubers usually solve the cross on the bottom side to avoid cube rotations, which slow down solve times. Cross solved (White on bottom) * First Two Layers (F2L) ‚Äì In F2L, corner and edge pieces are paired up and later moved to their correct location. There are 42 standard cases for each corner-edge pair including the case where it is already solved. It can also be done intuitively. 210x210px * Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL) ‚Äì This stage involves manipulating the top layer so that all the pieces therein have the same colour on top, at the expense of incorrect colours on other sides. This stage involves a total of 57 algorithms. A simpler version, called \\"two-look OLL\\" orients edges first and corners afterwards. Algorithms are usually performed two to three times for this version. It uses ten algorithms, three for edge orientation and seven for corner orientation. 210x210px * Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) ‚Äì The final stage involves moving the pieces of the top layer while preserving their orientation. There is a total of 21 algorithms for this stage. They are distinguished by letter names, usually based on what they look like with arrows representing what pieces are swapped around (e.g., A permutation, F permutation, T permutation, etc.). \\"Two-look\\" PLL solves the corners first and edges separately. It uses six algorithms, two for corner permutation and up to four for edge permutation. Also, a U-perm can be repeated if the user wishes to use even fewer algorithms at the expense of usually faster solve times. There also exist many advanced extension algsets to be used in companion to CFOP, such as COLL,https://jperm.net/algs/coll Winter Variation,https://jperm.net/algs/wv VLS, ZBLL, and more. However, it is not necessary to learn them in order to solve the cube. Competition Use CFOP is heavily used and relied upon by many speedcubers, including Rowe Hessler, Mats Valk, and Feliks Zemdegs, for its heavy reliance on algorithms, pattern recognition, and muscle memory, as opposed to more intuitive methods such as the Roux or Petrus methods. The majority of top speed cubers on the WCA ranking list are CFOP solvers, including the current 3x3x3 single world record holder (Yusheng Du (ÊùúÂÆáÁîü)), with a time of 3.47 seconds.Reconstruction of Yusheng Du's 3.47 World Record solve References External links * Jessica Fridrich's official site * CFOP method on Speedsolving.com Wiki * All OLL and PLL algorithms can be found on http://algdb.net/ * How to solve Rubik's Cube Rubik's Cube ","title":"CFOP method"},{"id":"3504977","text":"Newton-on-Ouse is a village and civil parish in the Hambleton District of North Yorkshire, England, about north-west of York.

The population of civil parish taken at the 2011 Census was less than 100. Details are included in the civil parish of Shipton, North Yorkshire. The East Coast Main Line passes to the east, not far from the village. History The village is mentioned three times in the Domesday Book as Ovretun in the Bulford hundred. The manor belonged to Earl Morcar, who had a hall in the village, at the time of the Norman invasion. Some of the land was the possession of the Church of St Peter in York and of Thorbiorn. The manor passed to the Crown and Count Alan of Brittany by 1086. Both granted the manor to St Mary's Abbey, York. The Hall that once stood in the village was the country seat of the Abbots until the dissolution. The Hall was demolished at some time in the 18th century, though earthworks indicate where the old moat may have been. Eventually the manor and estate came into the hands of the Bourchier, and thence the Dawnay, family at Beningbrough. The parish was once much larger and included the manors of Shipton and Skelton. The remains of the base of a limestone cross indicate that there may have been a church in the village at one time.

Pearl Lake is named for M. Pearl Hartt, the wife of pioneer sheep rancher, John Kelly Hartt. History John Kelly Hartt was a principal owner of three of the largest sheep companies in U.S. history--Pioneer, Cow Creek and Yellowstone. The sheep wintered near Rawlins, Wyoming. The Cow Creek and Pioneer sheep summered near Hahn's Peak, Colorado in the place that is now Pearl Lake. John Kelly Hartt died in the early 1950s, eventually resulting in the sale of the land by his wife, Pearl, to the U.S. Forest Service. That sale started the event that shifted this region from primarily agricultural to primarily recreational. Activities Recreational opportunities in Pearl State Park include camping, boating, fishing and picnicking. There are 36 campsites amongst the forest of fir, spruce and pine. In addition to tent camping, trailers and small motor homes are permitted. The park also has two yurts available for rent. The lake permits boating, including gasoline and electric motors (though boaters are restricted to wakeless speeds). Fishing (license required) is restricted to flies and artificial lures (no bait permitted). During the winter, due to snowfall (over annually), the roads and facilities are closed. However, the park is open for foot and snowmobile access. Cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and ice fishing are popular winter activities.

It lies on the York to Helmsley road about north of York. Stillington Mill was the endpoint of the Foss Navigation Act of 1793. History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Stivelincton in the Bulford hundred. The lordship of the manor was in the possession of the Archbishop of York St Peter at the time of the Norman invasion and remained so afterwards. The church continued to hold the land until 1616, when it was leased to a William Ramsden. The lease was then granted to Christopher Croft in 1625. During the first year of the Commonwealth, many church lands were put up for sale and Croft purchased the manor outright. Following the Restoration, Christopher Croft, son of the former, sought a grant from the church for the manor when many church lands were being reclaimed. He was Lord Mayor of York at the time and was knighted soon after. The Croft family held the manor until 1895 when it was sold. The name is derived from the name of a local Saxon settler, Styfel, and the Old English word tun, meaning farm. Therefore, as a whole it means Styfel's farm. Governance The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It also gives it name to the electoral division of North Yorkshire and the District ward of Hambleton District Council within which it lies. The local Parish Council has seven members that are re-elected every four years.

The B1363 road between York and Oswaldkirk runs north-south through the village following the old Turnpike set up in 1768. =Demography= In 1881 the population was recorded as being 600. The 2001 UK Census recorded the population as 741 in 326 households. The population was made of 50.2% males and 49.8% females, of which, 613 (82.7%) were over the age of sixteen years. There were 340 dwellings of which 155 were detached. The population of the village increased to 782 at the 2011 Census. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north to Yearsley with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 1,919. Amenities =Economy= The area around the village is farmland and much of the local business is still involved in this. There are some small local enterprises. The Post Office is run by the local community. There are two public houses, with the other former pub now being a food establishment. =Education= A National School was built on The Green in 1821 on the site of the current village hall. The present Primary School built in 1907 is located on Main Street and is within the catchment area of Easingwold School for secondary education. =Sports= Stillington Sports and Social Club was founded in 1959 when the joint committees of the existing Cricket and Football Clubs purchased six acres of land from the Church Commissioners. Cricket has been played at Stillington since the 1840s, in The Park by permission of the Croft Family. The club joined the York and District League in the 1880s.

It is found on reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, from the Red Sea in the west to Samoa in the east, and from the Yaeyama Islands in the north to the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in the south. Other common names include bumphead parrotfish, humphead parrotfish, double-headed parrotfish, buffalo parrotfish, and giant parrotfish. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Bolbometopon and is the largest herbivorous fish inhabiting coral reefs.  Species description  Unlike wrasses, it has a vertical head profile, and unlike other parrotfishes, it is uniformly covered with scales except for the leading edge of the head, which is often light green to pink. Primary phase colouration is a dull gray with scattered white spots, gradually becoming uniformly dark green. This species does not display sex-associated patterns of color change. The adult develops a bulbous forehead and the teeth plates are exposed, being only partly covered by lips. The species is slow-growing and long-lived (up to 40 years), with delayed reproduction and low replenishment rates. This species is gregarious and usually occurs in small aggregations, but group size can be quite large on seaward and clear outer lagoon reefs, exceeding 75 individuals.  Reproduction  The green humphead parrotfish, is sexually monochromatic, i.e. there is no initial or terminal phase in the life cycle of the adults. The fish spawn pelagically near the outer reef slope or near promontories, gutters, or channel mouths during a lunar cycle, usually spawning just prior to the new moon. They make use of spawning aggregation sites. Ritualized headbutting of males at Wake Atoll  Ecology  Newly settled juveniles are found in branching coral habitats (primarily Acropora) in sheltered lagoons. Small juveniles (<50mm) are often associated with Damselfish. Larger juvenile green humphead parrotfish are found in lagoons, often in seagrass beds, and the adults are found in clear outer lagoons and seaward reefs up to a depth of 30 m. They feed on benthic algae and live corals. Adult green humphead parrotfish may ram its head against corals to facilitate feeding. Each adult fish ingests over five tons of structural reef carbonates per year, contributing significantly to the bioerosion of reefs. The fish sleeps among corals, in caves and shipwrecks at night, usually in large groups.  Conservation  The large size, slow growth and schooling behavior of this species mean it is susceptible to overfishing. This species is highly sought after by fishermen throughout its range, and it has declined from overharvesting. Spearfishers and netters target large groups as they sleep at night. The species was identified as a Species of Concern by NOAA/NMFS in 2004, meaning that the species is thought to be threatened, but insufficient data are available to justify a listing under the Endangered Species Act. Habitat degradation and destruction has accelerated the decline. Juvenile habitats are susceptible to being degraded by poor water quality, such as run- off of sediments from logging. Spearfishing while scuba diving was banned in American Samoa in 2001. The waters surrounding Wake Island, Johnston Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll from the shoreline out to are protected as low-use marine protected areas, which means any person of the United States fishing for, taking, or retaining this fish must have a special permit. Also, it may not be taken by means of spearfishing with SCUBA gear from 6 pm to 6 am in the US Exclusive Economic Zone waters around these territories.

The definition can be split into two different phenomena, co-occurrence, which refers to the presence of two (possibly unrelated) fluorophores in the same pixel, and correlation, a much more significant statistical relationship between the fluorophores indicative of a biological interaction. This technique is important to many cell biological and physiological studies during the demonstration of a relationship between pairs of bio-molecules.  History  The ability to demonstrate a correlation between a pair of bio- molecules was greatly enhanced by Erik Manders of the University of Amsterdam who introduced Pearson's correlation coefficient to microscopists,Manders et al (1992). \\"Dynamics of three-dimensional replication patterns during the S-phase, analysed by double labelling of DNA and confocal microscopy.\\" along with other coefficients of which the \\"overlap coefficients\\" M1 and M2 have proved to be the most popular and useful.Zinchuk V et al (2007). \\"Quantitative colocalization analysis of multicolor confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images: pushing pixels to explore biological phenomena\\". Acta Histochem Cytochem 40:101-111. The purpose of using coefficients is to characterize the degree of overlap between images, usually two channels in a multidimensional microscopy image recorded at different emission wavelengths. A popular approach was introduced by Sylvain Costes, who utilized Pearson's correlation coefficient as a tool for setting the thresholds required by M1 and M2 in an objective fashion.Costes et al (2004) \\"Automatic and Quantitative Measurement of Protein-Protein Colocalization in Live Cells.\\" Costes approach makes the assumption that only positive correlations are of interest, and does not provide a useful measurement of PCC. Although the use of coefficients can significantly improve the reliability of colocalization detection, it depends on the number of factors, including the conditions of how samples with fluorescence were prepared and how images with colocalization were acquired and processed. Studies should be conducted with great caution, and after careful background reading. Currently the field is dogged by confusion and a standardized approach is yet to be firmly established.BOLTE and CORDELI√àRES (2006) \\"A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.\\" Attempts to rectify this include re-examination and revision of some of the coefficients,Adler and Parmryd (2010)\\"Quantifying colocalization by correlation: The Pearson correlation coefficient is superior to the Mander's overlap coefficient.\\" Krau√ü et al (2015). \\"Colocalization of fluorescence and Raman microscopic images for the identification of subcellular compartments: a validation study.\\" Analyst, volume 140, issue 7, pages 2360-2368. application of a factor to correct for noise,Adler et al. (2008) \\"Replicate based noise corrected correlations for accurate measurements of colocalization\\". and the proposal of further protocols,Curr Protoc Cell Biol \\"Quantitative colocalization analysis of confocal fluorescence microscopy images.\\" which were thoroughly reviewed by Bolte and Cordelieres (2006). In addition, due to the tendency of fluorescence images to contain a certain amount of out-of-focus signal, and poisson shot and other noise, they usually require pre-processing prior to quantification.Pawley JB (2006). Handbook of Biological Confocal MicroscopyZinchuk V et al (2011). \\"Quantifying spatial correlations of fluorescent markers using enhanced background reduction with protein proximity index and correlation coefficient estimations\\". Nat Protoc 6:1554-1567. Careful image restoration by deconvolution removes noise and increases contrast in images, improving the quality of colocalization analysis results. Up to now, most frequently used methods to quantify colocalization calculate the statistical correlation of pixel intensities in two distinct microscopy channels. More recent studies have shown that this can lead to high correlation coefficients even for targets that are known to reside in different cellular compartments. A more robust quantification of colocalization can be achieved by combining digital object recognition, the calculation of the area overlap and combination with a pixel-intensity correlation value. This led to the concept of an object-corrected Pearson's correlation coefficient. Examples of use Some impermeable fluorescent zinc dyes can detectably label the cytosol and nuclei of apoptizing and necrotizing cells among each of four different tissue types examined. Namely: the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and it was also demonstrated that colocalized detection of zinc increase and the well accepted cell death indicator propidium iodide also occurred in kidney cells. Using the principles of fluorescent colocalization. coincident detection of zinc accumulation and propidium iodide (a traditional cell death indicator) uptake in multiple cell types was demonstrated. Various examples of quantification of colocalization in the field of neuroscience can be found in a review.Zinchuk V & Grossenbacher-Zinchuk O (2009). \\"Recent advances in quantitative colocalization analysis: Focus on neuroscience\\". Prog Histochem Cytochem 44:125-172 Detailed protocols on the quantification of colocalization can be found in a book chapter. Single-molecule resolution Colocalization is used in real-time single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to detect interactions between fluorescently labeled molecular species. In this case, one species (e.g. a DNA molecule) is typically immobilized on the imaging surface, and the other species (e.g. a DNA-binding protein) is supplied to the solution. The two species are labeled with dyes of spectrally resolved (>50 nm) colors, e.g. cyanine-3 and cyanine-5. Fluorescence excitation is typically carried out in total internal reflection mode which increases the signal-to-noise ratio for the molecules at the surface with respect to the molecules in bulk solution. The molecules are detected as spots appearing on the surface in real-time, and their locations are found to within 10-20 nm by fitting of point-spread functions. Since typical sizes of biomolecules are on the order of 10 nm, this precision is usually sufficient for calling of molecular interactions Interpretation of results For the purpose of better interpretation of the results of qualitative and quantitative colocalization studies, it was suggested to use a set of five linguistic variables tied to the values of colocalization coefficients, such as very weak, weak, moderate, strong, and very strong, for describing them. The approach is based on the use of the fuzzy system model and computer simulation. When new coefficients are introduced, their values can be fitted into the set.

Career Her first film and starring role was in Banthuk Rak Pimchawee ('Love Diary of Pimchawee'), in 1961. She co-starred with popular leading man, Mitr Chaibancha, and they proved to be popular pair, starring together in more than 150 films. One of their most popular films was 1970's Monrak luk thung (, or 'Magical Love of the Countryside'), a musical rhapsodizing Thai rural life. In 1964, Petchara was named best actress by the Thailand National Film Awards committee for her role in Nok Noi, and received the award from King Bhumibol.

This ingredient lends a subtle bitterness to the otherwise rich and slightly salty tasting cheese. It is aged for at least sixty days. The fully ripe cheese has a creamy consistency in the center, and is traditionally eaten by slicing off the top and scooping out the inside. In 1999, the cheese was given protected-origin status, regulations that stipulate not only where it can be produced, but also that it can only be made with the milk of Merino and Entrefina sheep. These breeds have a low yield of milk, and it takes the milk of 20 sheep to make a wheel of Torta del Casar.

The term \\"Franks\\" may refer to an ethnic group or to the inhabitants of a territory called Francia. The first office was that of the mayors of the palace of the Merovingian kings of the Franks, whose powers increased as those of the kings declined. The second was that of the second-in-command to the early kings of France, the last incumbent of which succeeded to the throne in 987. This title was sometimes rendered as Duke of France (dux Franciae). The third instance was that of the rulers of the Frankish-inhabited lands of Germany, the so-called \\"tribal\\" duchy of Franconia. Dux et princeps Francorum Up until the time after Dagobert I, the title princeps (prince) had royal connotations. The first time it was used to describe the mayors of the palace of Neustria was in mid-7th-century saints' lives. The Vita Eligii refers to unspecified principes of the palatium of Neustria, and the Vita Baldechildis and Passio Leudegarii describe the mayors Erchinoald and Ebroin as princes. Pippin II first used the title princeps after his victory at the Battle of Tertry in 687. Both the Liber historiae Francorum and the Vita Dagoberti tertii refer to him by this title, but the continuation of the Chronicle of Fredegar uses only the title \\"duke\\". The historian Bede refers to Pippin II as dux Francorum, but the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon translator of Bede uses the term Froncna cyning (king of the Franks). The continuator of Fredegar refers to Ragamfred as a prince, but he only calls his rival, Pippin's son Charles Martel, a prince after his defeat of Ragamfred in 718. The princely title was used continuously from this point on for Charles and his descendants, the Carolingians, both in narrative and charter sources. In 742, Pippin's grandson, Carloman, held his great Concilium Germanicum, at which he addressed the assembled \\"servants of God and my great men ... who are in my kingdom\\" as \\"duke and prince of the Franks\\". The council declared that \\"without the patronage of the prince of the Franks it is impossible to defend the people of the church, the presbyters, clerics, monks and nuns of God.\\" When in 744 Carloman's brother, Pippin III, used the same title, he did not refer to \\"my kingdom\\", since by then a Merovingian king, Childeric III, had been appointed. The ducal/princely title used by the early Carolingians marked them off as peers of the duke‚Äìprinces of Aquitaine, also nominally under the Merovingians, rather than as sovereigns over them. Dux Franciae A charter from the reign of King Odo (888‚Äì898) for the church Saint-Aignan d'Orl√©ans that titles Robert the Strong dux Francorum is a 17th-century forgery. Between 936 and 943, the title dux Francorum was revived at the request of Hugh the Great, the most powerful magnate in France. A charter of King Louis IV of 936 refers to him that way, and a charter of Hugh's own from 937 employs the title. Its usage was not exclusive, however, since the title \\"count\\" (comes) continued to be used as well. In one charter, Louis explained that Hugh was second to him in all his kingdoms. This interpretation of the title dux Francorum was not universally accepted. According to Flodoard of Reims, the king only \\"invested Hugh with the duchy of France\\" in 943 in reward for the latter's help in returning the king from exile. The duchy of Francia (ducatus Franciae) comprised the region between the Loire and the Seine, the ancient kingdom of Neustria. On this contemporary understanding, Hugh's title was analogous to that of the dukes of Aquitaine, dux Aquitanorum, where the territorial designation (\\"of Aquitaine\\") was eschewed in favour of an ethnic one (\\"of the Aquitainians\\"). \\"Duke of the Franks\\" thus became the preferred title of the Robertian margraves of Neustria from 943. Walther Kienast suggested that the title served to connect Hugh with the previous duces Francorum, Pippin II and Charles Martel, and buttress his authority in Francia, from which he was frequently absent on visits to the royal court. Hugh died in 956 and was succeeded by his son and heir, the child Hugh Capet. In 960, according to Flodoard, \\"the king [Lothair] made Hugh [Capet] a duke, and added for him the country of Poitou to the land which his father had held.\\" The younger Hugh's first charter with the ducal title dates to 966, while the first royal charter with the title dates to 974. Lothair son, Louis V, already king of the Aquitainians, recognised Hugh as duke of the Franks in a charter of 979. The title fell into abeyance and the Neustrian march ceased to form an administrative unit after Hugh succeeded to the French throne in 987. Nevertheless, the officials and vassals (fideles) of the duchy of Francia became the chief men of the king of France after 987. Although the royal demesne was enlarged by Hugh's accession, royal action became more geographically restricted to Francia. Modern historians have proffered two interpretations of the 10th-century use of dux Francorum. Jan Dhondt and Walther Kienast argued that the title was a royal concession recognising the actual power acquired by the Robertians over the region known as Francia, that is, old Neustria. Thus the title was territorial in nature, reflective of Hugh's real power and a royal (legal) grant. Ferdinand Lot argued that the title was viceregal and represented authority in theory over the entire realm and in fact power second only to that of the king. Dux Francorum orientalium The emergence of the Duchy of Franconia from \\"a position of leadership amongst the Frankish nation in the eastern kingdom\\" in the late 9th century is poorly documented. The first clear duke was Conrad the Elder, who was also Duke of Thuringia. In 906 he died and was succeeded as duke by his son, Conrad the Younger, who was elected King of Germany in 911, without relinquishing his ducal office. Although it seems likely that Conrad's brother, Eberhard, held the duchy of Franconia during the reign of Henry I (919‚Äì36), the first reference to him with the title dux Francorum comes from the early in the reign of Otto I (936‚Äì73). In 956, Otto (II) the Salian inherited Nahegau from his father, Conrad the Red, then added Wormsgau, Speyergau, Niddagau and between the Neckar and the Rhine the counties of Elsenzgau, Kraichgau, Enzgau, Pfinzgau and perhaps Ufgau. Otto was Duke of Carinthia from 978 to 985, and after his retirement from Carinthian office was titled Wormatiensis dux Francorum (\\"Frankish duke of Worms\\"), the first titular dukedom in Germany. His son, Conrad, who succeeded him in Carinthia, was also titled \\"duke of Worms\\". Conrad III of Germany, before his election as king, held the title \\"Duke of the East Franks\\" (dux Francorum orientalium).

The cartoons originated from a series of love notes that Grove drew for her future husband, Roberto Casali. They were published in booklets in the late 1960s before appearing in strip form in a newspaper in 1970, under the pen name \\"Kim\\". They were syndicated soon after and the strip is syndicated worldwide today by Tribune Content Agency. One of her most famous drawings, \\"Love Is...being able to say you are sorry\\", published on February 9, 1972, was marketed internationally for many years in print, on cards and on souvenirs. The beginning of the strip coincided closely with the 1970 film Love Story. The film's signature line is \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\\" At the height of their popularity in the early to mid 1970s, the cartoons were earning Casali around five to six million dollars annually. Roberto Casali was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1975 and Kim stopped working on the cartoon to spend more time with him. Casali commissioned London-based British cartoonist Bill Asprey to take over the writing and drawing of the daily cartoons for her, under her pen name. Asprey has produced the cartoon continuously since 1975. Upon her death in 1997, Casali's son Stefano took over Minikim, the company which handles the intellectual rights. The strip appears daily except Sunday. Comic strip features Love Is... is a single-frame strip. The upper left-hand corner starts with a simple phrase which always begins with \\"Love Is...\\", the drawing appears in the middle and the remainder of the phrase at the bottom (along with the legal jargon). Each strip is independent of the others; there are no \\"series\\" of strips running for a period of time covering the same topic. The main characters are a man and woman depicted unclothed, with no primary or secondary sexual features shown other than the woman having nipples. It is clear which character is male and which is female due to tertiary features. The male has dark black, short hair while the female has light, waist-length hair. The characters have been featured in various stages of romance: just meeting, as boyfriend and girlfriend, and as a married couple. Sometimes, the male is shown in a military uniform. A 1974 strip has the male naming the female as \\"Kim\\",\\"Love is... your name pronounced by him while sleeping\\", 1974 while a 1971 panel has the female writing the letter 'R' in the beach sand. Both of these are consistent with original cartoonist Kim Casali and her husband Roberto. The strip occasionally includes the couple's two children. The boy and girl have the hair coloring of their opposite gender parent, and have been featured both as infants and as elementary school age. From time to time the female's parents (one or both) are shown, both parents have light hair and are featured as being elderly. The male's parents have also featured in the strips. They have similar looks as those of female's parents. In one of the strips, female is shown talking to her mother-in-law over the phone. A dog, Samson, is shown sometimes in their household, and in one strip they had a small grave with a stick with the name Fido on it, presumably a recently deceased pet dog. In one 2005 strip the couple are accompanied by two cats, and in 2009 the woman is shown crying over her deceased cat. The characters may appear single or together; when one is thinking about the other, the partner's face will appear (in various forms, such as a dream balloon, a photo or a screen saver). Items appearing in the strip are often shown in the shape of or featuring, hearts - symbolic of the strip's theme. The male is sometimes shown reading a newspaper named Daily Blah. Other men shown in the strips are different in their looks. They have curly blond hair and sometimes shown with a mustache, while the male is always shown with his usual black short straight hair. Other women shown in strips are short haired as compared to the female who has waist length hair. Although the strip generally deals with light issues, sometimes there are messages related to environment conservation and teaching their kids lessons about the environment. In one of the strips the characters are shown campaigning to save children. Alternate versions In the 1980s an alternate version of the strip ran in the \\"Cartoons\\" paper in the British newspaper the Mail on Sunday. This was a three- or four-panel strip, with the male and female characters drawn fully clothed. The Turkish version of the strip (A≈ük ...dƒ±r.) is sold in form of small pieces of comic strips wrapped around gum. Mobile app The cartoon has an official application on Apple's iTunes store.

He studied under director Kajiro Yamamoto, along with future directors Akira Kurosawa, Ishir≈ç Honda, and Senkichi Taniguchi. When the latter two trainees were drafted into WW2, Oda found his career accelerated. He was promoted to director in 1940 with Song of Kunya. Toho kept Oda working as a director of trivial films that had to be made in order to keep product flowing into the theaters, but which offered little time or room for artistic achievement. His most well-known credits are Lady From Hell (1949), Tomei Ningen a 1954 Japanese horror inspired by The Invisible Man, a follow-up to his earlier 1954 film Ghost Man. The only film he made ever to be shown outside Japan was the second Godzilla film, Godzilla Raids Again (1955), released in the United States as Gigantis, the Fire Monster. Toho insisted that Oda direct as many as seven movies a year, knowing that he could be trusted to deliver them on time.

Etymology The name Crayke is of Brittonic origin. It is derived from the neo-Brittonic Cumbric cr·∫π:g, meaning \\"a crag\\" or \\"prominent rock\\" (Welsh craig). Craik in Scotland has the same origin. History There is evidence that there has been a settlement here since the times of the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The village is named in the Domesday Book as Crec, part of the Yarlestre hundred and noted as belonging to the Bishop of Durham. The parish was formerly a detached part of County Durham (until 1844), due to its connection with St Cuthbert and the Diocese of Durham, which owned Crayke Castle. The seventh-century king Egfrid granted Crayke to the church in 685 to be used by Cuthbert on his visits to York, to which end Cuthbert founded a monastery here. Cuthbert died in 687AD. The monk Aediluulf wrote a poem Carmen de Abbatibus between 803 and 821 about the history of his monastery, and some scholars propose that the monastery, which was in the circle of Lindisfarne, was in Crayke. (For instance, Michael Lapidge in Anglo-Latin Literature 600‚Äì899, Hambledon Press, London 1996) According to the chronicler Symeon, the Northumbrian King Aelle appropriated Crayke and used it as his headquarters during the unsuccessful campaign against the Danes in 867. He also reports that when the congregation of St Cuthbert was wandering homeless during the seven-year period 875‚Äì882 the monks remained four months at Crayke. In Norman times the Bishops of Durham constructed a castle over the monastic cemetery, though no traces now remain. Links with Cuthbert and the bishopric of Durham are recognised in the dedication of the 1436 Anglican church to St Cuthbert, and the naming of the pub as the Durham Ox, (an allusion to the foundation myth of Durham). Governance The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency having previously been in the Vale of York UK Parliament constituency. It is part of the Stillington electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. It is also within the Stillington ward of Hambleton District Council. The Parish Council is made of seven councillors including the Chair. Geography The region around Crayke shown as an exclave of Durham, in Betts's Family Atlas, 1846. The village is at an elevation of at its highest point. The nearest settlements are Easingwold to the south-west; Stillington to the south-east; Brandsby to the north-east and Oulston to the north. The River Foss lies just to the east of the village. According to the 1881 census the population of the village was 501. In the 2001 UK Census the population was recorded as 390, of which 315 were over the age of sixteen and 206 of those were in employment. There are 168 dwellings of which 102 were detached. The village is served by the Easingwold to York bus route as well as a School Bus to Easingwold School. There is a public house and several local businesses in the village. There is a sports and leisure club on the outskirts where tennis and cricket are played. Education Primary education is available in the village at Crayke Primary School. The school lies within the Easingwold School catchment area for Secondary education. Religion In the Dark Ages, Crayke was home to Echa of Crayke, an eighth century Anglo-Saxon Saint, priest and monk-hermit, known for his holiness, healingPaul E.

Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982. St. Cuthbert's Church, Crayke There is a church in the village dedicated to St Cuthbert. It was so named following the time of the Danish invasions, when the body of St Cuthbert was unearthed and travelled around the north of England to protect it. The monks rested with his body at Crayke for a time. The present building was erected in 1490 in the Perpendicular style. In the 19th century there were Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist chapels in the village as well as a Catholic chapel, all now disused. Notable buildings The village is the site of a 15th-century castle. The Grade I listed building was constructed around 1450. There are 28 Grade II listed buildings in the village, including the Brandsby Royal Observer Corps monitoring post that operated from 1964 to 1991 at Zion Hill Farm on Key Lane. Its purpose was to monitor radioactive fallout in the event of a nuclear war. It was built underground to hold a staff of three who could live self-sufficiently for three weeks.

The Commission found that there was no evidence of this. *Foster disputed the paper's claims that he had tried to sell his story to Granada Television, though the Press Complaints Commission concluded that as he had appeared to try to sell the story any inaccuracy about the company he had tried to sell the story to was not significant. *The commission concluded that The Sun was entitled under the code to express its view that Foster had tried to \\"ruin\\" Tony Blair and that the paper had not breached the code when it had claimed on 17 December that Foster had not told the truth in a statement to the press. 2003 Ireland deportation Foster had also spent time living with his mother in Malahide, north of Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland in 2002, selling slimming pills called TRIMit through a company called Bellethos and asking investors to buy franchise rights for ‚Ç¨200,000.

The company hid Foster's involvement, and its advertising claimed the pills were 700% more effective than their rivals. Foster's business partner, Barrister, Sean Cousins, promoted the pills, kept silent on Foster's involvement in the business and the fact he knew the pills didn't work. The scam netted at least $1 million from 70 people who paid up to $42,000 each for the rights to distribute the pills.

Foster also denied he was a fraudster, claiming, \\"I've never stolen a cent in my life,\\" and that he does not lie. Denton commented that lying is not a habit for white collar criminals, but a business, and that Foster is \\"ultimately in the business of selling himself\\". Foster said he was ashamed of his conman title and \\"only a fool would enjoy the publicity I get.\\" Fiji arrest 2006 Late 2005, Foster returned to Fiji, gaining entry to the country and obtaining a work permit using a forged police clearance certificate to conceal his criminal record. He reportedly gained a lease on waterfront property at Champagne Beach, in the Yasawa Islands, and sought investors to develop a resort. Foster had again involved himself in local politics, offering financial support to the ruling SDL party for the successful 2006 re-election. However, he switched his support when the Qarase government was usurped in the Bainimarama military coup. Foster approached the military and offered to covertly obtain evidence that the Qarase regime had been corrupt. On 2 January 2007, the military released what it said was a secretly obtained video of a restaurant conversation between Foster and Navitalai Naisoro, the electoral strategist of the SDL party.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration banned the sale of SensaSlim with effect from 1 December 2011 for advertising breaches. He was released on A$125,000 bail in December 2011. The judge noted that Foster had complied with bail conditions since being released in 2009, was close to his sick mother and that she would benefit from him looking after her. In September 2012 he claimed in court that his only involvement with Sensaslim was to allow a promotional video to be filmed in his house, but denied being involved with production of the DVD. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission claimed that Foster assumed false identities while operating the scam, using the moniker IMOM, or \\"International Man of Mischief\\", in a table charting the development of the business and also to denote his own number in his mobile phone. Foster denied creating the table and claimed that the nickname referred to a former business partner. He was charged with contempt of court for breaching the 2005 Federal Court order banning him from taking part in the weight-loss industry. =2012 legal action= In January 2012, Foster took out a restraining order against a Gold Coast sports betting scheme proprietor, Philip Cropper, under the Peace and Good Behaviour Act. His solicitor asked the magistrate to regard a summons as having been served after having difficulties serving it, but the magistrate urged that further attempts should be made. Foster accused Philip Cropper of attempted blackmail, but withdrew the complaints in June. =2013 contempt of court conviction and disappearance= In 2013 the Federal court of Australia found Foster in contempt of court for his involvement with SensaSlim while still under the court ordered ban obtained against him in 2005.. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment but failed to appear and was sentenced in absentia. Foster claimed he would be provided with a Fiji protection visa if he could get an outstanding arrest warrant lifted. He sent photos of himself holding a Fijian national news broadsheet to a Sydney newspaper to give the impression he'd fled to Fiji. Local police denied they had been asked for help in apprehending him by Australian police. The notion that Foster would return to Fiji where he still had 2006 charges pending over the forgery of documents was greeted with skepticism there. He issued an appeal against the jail sentence for contempt while in hiding. On 14 February 2014, an Interpol Alert was issued for Foster for extradition to Australia to face contempt of court charges. Later it was found Foster had falsely purported to have been in Fiji from the time he absconded until his arrest in October 2014. = 2014 arrest and connection with Sports Trading Club = Foster was arrested near Byron Bay in New South Wales on 28 October 2014. He pleaded guilty to assaulting police and resisting arrest during the raid and was extradited to Queensland to serve a minimum of 18 months for the contempt of court conviction. Footage from the arrest showed he was operating sports betting scheme, Sports Trading Club, under the alias Mark Hughes. The company was owned by a Hong Kong company under his niece, Arabella Foster's, name. By late 2014, the Queensland Office of Fair Trading had received almost 400 complaints about Sports Trading Club, which claimed to have made a 1350% profit over eight months. Foster was granted conditional early release six months before the end of his sentence in October 2015. The reasons for the release were redacted from the ruling due to a claim that publication would place Foster at an unspecified risk. Foster's former lawyer and business partner Sean Cousins said of his former client's release that Foster \\"had mastered the art of escaping jail by becoming a prison informant\\". In December 2015 it was reported that Foster had forged the signature of a Queensland Justice of the peace on a sworn affidavit. The lawyer acting for victims became suspicious that the JPs name was misspelt and after tracking down a JP with the same registration number and similar name, provided the court with an attestation that the signature on the affidavit was not that of the JP in question. = 2015 police investigation = In December 2015 Australian police began investigating allegations that Foster had tried to hire a hitman to kill private investigator Ken Gamble. Mr Gamble had reportedly discovered proceeds from Fosters' most recent crime. The home of Fosters' mother and a property in Byron Bay had been raided and phones seized, but there were no indications that Foster's mother played a part. Foster had not commented by the end of December and police declined to comment as it was an ongoing investigation. = 2016 fine and ban = In May 2016 Foster was fined AU$660,000 and permanently banned from being a company director or having any business in the diet or health industry as a result of his involvement in SensaSlim. SensaSlim was fined a total of AU$3.55m. Fosters' involvement was carefully concealed from investors. He was behind the invention of a non-existent Swiss research institute, Institut de Recherche Intercontinental, which it was falsely claimed was conducting a large worldwide trial into the efficacy of SensaSlim. The court found that SensaSlim directors had concealed Fosters' involvement in the scheme, knowing that his reputation as a conman would put people off SensaSlim. Federal Court Justice David Yates described Foster as \\"beyond redemption\\". Justice Yates also said \\"He preys on the right-mindedness of others to cheat and deceive. In the present case, he lurked behind SensaSlim precisely for that purpose\\".. = 2016 racehorse investigation = In December 2016, it was announced that Azkadellia, winner of the 2016 Queen of the Turf would be stripped of A$1.5 million in prize money. The mare had been bought from Ciaron Maher Racing in 2014 for A$280,000 with money from Peter Fosters' failed online betting company Sports Trading Company. The horse was registered in the name of Arabella Racing Pty Ltd, formerly owned by a Hong Kong company controlled by Arabella Foster, niece of Peter. On August 31, 2014, she completed a declaration that Arabella Racing Pty Ltd owned the horse, though there were suspicions that she was providing a front for her uncle. Ownership of Arabella Racing Pty Ltd was transferred to a Canadian, Thomas Sebastian Cain, who in February 2015 completed a transfer-of-ownership form, declaring to racing authorities that he was the new owner of Azkadellia. He did not declare that he was formerly known as Matthew Thomas Reed and has been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in 2007 for smuggling cocaine and ecstasy tablets worth A$211 million into Queensland from British Columbia. On 25 August 2015, Cain completed a transfer of ownership to Ben Connolly, who bought the horse for A$60,000. Private investigator Ken Gamble described the sale as a \\"deliberate and covert attempt to deceive Racing Victoria and to conceal Foster's beneficial interest in the racehorse\\". After Mr. Gamble met with Racing Victoria in September 2016, the latter reopened an investigation into the bona fides of Azkadellia, banning the horse from racing until stewards completed their inquiry. = 2017 arrest = On 10 February 2017 Foster was arrested on the Gold Coast for \\"fraud related issues\\". He was then extradited to New South Wales over his alleged involvement in a 2013 sports betting scam. On 14 February the matter was mentioned, then adjourned, at Waverley Local Court. The charges are connected to his 2014 'Sports Trading Club' arrest. In March he was refused bail on the grounds that he posed an unacceptable flight risk; this was confirmed by the Supreme Court on 27 July 2017. = 2018 bankruptcy = In January 2018 Foster was declared bankrupt after failing to pay the ACCC $53,714 in costs. = 2018 ordered to testify in murder case = In February 2018 a Brisbane magistrate ordered Peter Foster to testify in the murder case against John Chardon, who was accused of murdering his wife, Novy Chardon. Foster claimed that John Chardon had confessed to shooting Novy in the back because she planned to divorce him. Chardon's lawyer did not fight the order. In May 2018 Peter Foster claimed that John Chardon had confessed to shooting his wife and weighing down her body to dispose of it by allowing the outgoing tide to pull it out into Southport Seaway. = 2020 arrest = On 20 August 2020, Foster was arrested in Port Douglas on alleged links to an international sports trading scam.

In 1884 he married the painter and writer, Henrietta Rae (1859‚Äì1928). They both painted nude figures in lush settings, and were criticised for an apparent tendency towards an excess of sensuality in some of their paintings. The Normands were based in London from 1885, where Ernest had his studio and received support from the circle around Lord Leighton. They lived in Holland Park, an area known as the residence of many other artists of the day.Caroline Dakers, The Holland Park Circle: Artists and Victorian Society, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1999. Frequent visitors to their home included Leighton, Millais, Prinsep, and Watts.Fish, p. 47. These more senior artists adopted the Normands, but their criticism was not always welcome.

It is a variety of Purbeck stone that has been quarried since at least Roman times as a decorative building stone, but this industry is no longer active. Geology Stratigraphically these limestone beds lie towards the top of the Durlston Formation of the Purbeck Group. They were deposited during the Berriasian age of the Early Cretaceous epoch. Purbeck Marble is not a metamorphic rock, like a true marble, but is so-called because it can take a fine polish. Its characteristic appearance comes from densely packed shells of the freshwater snail Viviparus.Arkell, W. J. (1947), Geology of the country round Weymouth, Swanage, Corfe Castle and Lulworth. London: HMSO for British Geological Survey.Clements, R. G. (1993), \\"Type-section of the Purbeck Limestone Group, Durlston Bay, Swanage, Dorset\\", Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society, 114, 181‚Äì206. Sussex Marble is similar in type. The 'marble' is properly classified as a biomicrudite, as it consists of large clasts (the snail shells) in a fine-grained limestone mud matrix. The individual marble beds (also known as 'seams'), lie between layers of softer marine clays and mudstone, laid down during repeated marine ingressions. Some of the beds contain iron oxide/hydroxide minerals, such as hematite or limonite, giving red or brown varieties, while other beds contain glauconite giving a green (or occasionally blue) colour. Occurrence Purbeck Marble is found at outcrop, or beneath superficial cover, all the way across the Isle of Purbeck from Worbarrow Tout in the west to Peveril Point in the east. The marble beds are never more than 1.2 m thick and are often much thinner. The outcrops lie within the Purbeck Monocline, with the beds dipping moderately steeply to the north. Use There is a single example of Purbeck Marble being used during the Bronze Age, in a cist at Langton Matravers. During the Romano-British period, Purbeck Marble was used for inscriptions, architectural mouldings and veneers, mortars and pestles, and other articles.Beavis, John (1971), \\"Some aspects of the use of Purbeck Marble in Roman Britain\\", Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society, 92, 181‚Äì204. Purbeck Marble was also quarried in medieval times and can be seen in virtually all the cathedrals of the south of England, in columns and slab panels and flooring. For example, it is used in Exeter, Ely, Norwich, Chichester, Salisbury, Lincoln, Llandaff, Southwark and Canterbury Cathedrals, and in Westminster Abbey.Leach, Rosemary (1978), An investigation into the use of Purbeck marble in medieval England, 2nd edition. Crediton: the author. Additionally, it was utilised in the 13th-century King's Table, a furnishing used in coronation events. It has been less used in modern times, but a remarkable example is the church at Kingston, Purbeck, Dorset built in 1874‚Äì1880. Kingston (St James) Church Though other strata of Purbeck Limestone are being quarried at the present time (2008), there are no active quarries in the Purbeck Marble. However Purbeck Marble is required from time to time for restoration work, and some was extracted in 1993.Haysom, Treleven (1998), \\"Extracting Purbeck Marble\\", Hatcher Review, 5(45), 48‚Äì54.

Together with fellow astronomers Marc Aaronson and Jeremy Mould, Huchra announced that based on their analysis of the brightness and rotational speed of certain spiral galaxies that the universe was nine billion years old, half the age that most astronomers had previously thought. In 1986, Val√©rie de Lapparent, Margaret Geller and Huchra published the surprisingly non-uniform distribution of galaxies at scales of several tens of megaparsecs from early results of the CfA Redshift Survey. De Lapparent, Geller and Huchra described the galaxy distribution as apparently lying on the \\"surfaces of bubble-like structures\\".

Geller is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a Fellow of the American Physical Society. In 1990, she was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Two years later, she was elected to the Physics section of the US National Academy of Sciences. From 2000 to 2003, she served on the Council of the National Academy of Sciences. She has received seven honorary degrees (D. S. H. C. or L. H. C.). Research Geller is known for observational and theoretical work in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy. Her long range goals are to discover what the universe looks like overall and to understand how it came to have the patterns we observe it to have today. In the 1980s, she made pioneering maps of the large-scale structure of the universe, which led to the discovery of the Great Wall.M. J. Geller & J. P. Huchra, Science 246, 897 (1989). She leads a project called SHELS which looks into mapping the distribution of mysterious dark matter in the universe. With the 6.5-m MMT, she is conducting a more distant survey of the middle-aged universe called HectoMAP. Geller has developed innovative techniques for investigating the internal structure and total mass of clusters of galaxies and the relationship of clusters to the large-scale structure. Geller is also a co-discoverer of hypervelocity stars which may be an important tracer of the matter distribution in the Galaxy.W. R. Brown, M. J. Geller, S. J. Kenyon, and M. J. Kurtz, Astrophys. J. Letters 622, L33 (2005). Films and Public Lectures Geller has made several films for public education. Her 8-minute video Where the Galaxies Are (1989) was the first graphic voyage through the observed universe and was awarded a CINE Gold Eagle. A later 40-minute film, So Many Galaxies...So Little Time, contains more sophisticated prize-winning (IEEE/Siggraph) graphics and was on display at the National Air and Space Museum. Geller has lectured extensively to public audiences around the world. She has lectured twice in the main amphitheater at the Chautauqua Institution. She is included in NPR's list of The Best Commencement Speeches, Ever. Her story about her entry into astrophysics and meeting the renowned astrophysicist John Archibald Wheeler, entitled \\"Mapping the Universe\\" was published by The Story Collider podcast on May 21, 2014. Books Geller's work is discussed in Physics in the Twentieth Century. Popular articles by Geller appear with those by Robert Woodrow Wilson, David Todd Wilkinson, J.

Laves was probably the first person trained in modern linguistic fieldwork and analysis to study Australian languages. He intensively studied six languages: 'Kumbaingeri' (Gumbaynggir) in northern New South Wales; 'Karadjeri' (Karajarri) at Lagrange Bay, north-west Western Australia; 'Barda' (Bardi) at Cape Leveque, north-west Western Australia; 'Kurin' (Goreng) near Albany Western Australia; and 'Hermit Hill' (Matngele) and 'Ngengumeri (Ngan'gimerri) at Daly River Northern Territory. On the basis of his work Laves concluded that all Australian languages belong to a single language family. After his fieldwork he returned to Chicago, married [1932] and followed his mentor, Edward Sapir, to Yale in New Haven, CT where he continued his graduate studies. Before completing his Ph.D. (which he never finished) he left Yale to be a teacher on the Navajo reservation at Shiprock, New Mexico. Several years later he returned to Chicago where he began a career with the International Harvester Company in Chicago. Laves never returned to linguistics or anthropology and only published two notes based on his work on Australian languages (listed below). His collection of materials from his fieldwork sat in storage until Mark Francillon (an anthropology student at the University of Chicago) heard about it and made contact with Laves in 1983. He arranged for the collection to be copied and deposited (as were the originals, sometime later) in the library at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.

The 4,000-seat hall opened on October 2, 1854. The review in The New York Times declared it to be an acoustical \\"triumph\\", but \\"In every other aspect ... a decided failure,\\" complaining about the architecture, interior design and the closeness of the seating; although a follow-up several days later relented a bit, saying that the theater \\"looked more cheerful, and in every way more effective\\" than it had on opening night. The Academy's opera season became the center of social life for New York's elite, with the oldest and most prominent families owning seats in the theater's boxes. The opera house was destroyed by fire in 1866 and subsequently rebuilt, but it was supplanted as the city's premier opera venue in 1883 by the new Metropolitan Opera House ‚Äì created by the nouveaux riches who had been frozen out of the Academy ‚Äì and ceased presenting opera in 1886, turning instead to vaudeville. It was demolished in 1926 to make way for the Consolidated Edison Building. Opera house The Academy of Music has been described as \\"the first successful dedicated opera house in the United States,\\" but it was not the first building in New York designed specifically for opera.It was not the first dedicated opera house built in the United States either, which was the Th√©√¢tre d'Orl√©ans, built in New Orleans in 1819 as the city's first house designed for opera. See Belsom, Jack (2007). A History of Opera in New Orleans That honor goes to the Italian Opera House built in 1833 by Lorenzo Da Ponte as a home for his new New York Opera Company, which lasted only two seasons before the company was disbanded and the theatre sold.Burrows & Wallace p.585 Over a decade later, in 1847, the Isaiah Rogers-designed Astor Opera House opened on Astor Place,Burrows & Wallace p.724 only to close several years later after a riot provoked by competing performances of Macbeth by English actor William Charles Macready at the Opera House and American Edwin Forrest at the nearby Broadway Theatre. By May 1853, the interior had been dismantled and the furnishings sold off, with the shell of the building sold to the Mercantile Library Association. It was the demise of the Astor Opera House that spurred New York's elite to build a new opera house in what was then the more genteel neighborhood of Union Square,Burrows & Wallace, pp.761‚Äì765 led by Moses H. Grinnell, who formed a corporation in 1852 to fund the construction of the building, selling shares at $1,000 each to raise $200,000.

The height of the proscenium opening was . Its first opera season was from October through December 1854. The Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company was engaged by US actor James Henry Hackett. The company performed Bellini's Norma for the inauguration of the theatre with Giulia Grisi in the title role and Giuseppe Mario as Pollione headlining the performance under Max Maretzek's baton. The first season's repertoire was ambitious, and included Semiramide and The Barber of Seville by Rossini; Norma and La Sonnambula by Bellini; and Don Pasquale, Lucrezia Borgia, La Favorita and Lucia di Lammermoor by Donizetti.Burrows & Wallace, p.961 Maretzek's company performed an annual season at the Academy through 1878. His company was not the only group active at the opera house as the theater during this time. Musicologist George Whitney Martin writes: > New York's Academy of Music, from 1854 to 1883 the city's leading house for > opera, did not offer a secure base to any opera company. And why? Because it > was primarily a real estate venture run by a board of investors seeking the > highest rent possible.\\" Other opera companies active at the Academy, including Jaime Nun√≥'s Havana Italian Opera Troupe and the Max Strakosch Italian Opera Company, the latter of which began performing at the Academy in 1860 only to merge with Maretzek's company in 1868. The Academy hosted several American premieres, including Rigoletto (1855), Il trovatore (1855), La traviata (1856), Aida (1873), Lohengrin (1874), Die Walkure (1877) and Carmen (1878). The Academy's opera season became the center of social life for New York's wealthy gentry, but from its inception, the Academy of Music not only presented opera, but also served as a theater, and a meeting and exposition hall for a wide variety of functions, including political rallies, charity balls and science and industry fairs, among other events. In 1860 it was the site of a reception for the Prince of Wales. After the Civil War, an organization called the Cercle Fran√ßaise de l'Harmonie began using the Academy as a venue for masked balls, also called \\"French balls\\", in which the nouveau riche men of New York society would rub elbows - and other body parts - with semi-dressed prostitutes and courtesans, with little regard for public decorum or modesty. These balls were covered by the press, which did little to dim the enthusiasm or ribald behavior of the participants. One reporter wrote that women were thrown in the air and then sexually assaulted \\"amid the jeers and laughter of the other drunken wretches on the floor ... [with] not a whisper of shame in the crowd\\".Burrows & Wallace, p.965 These spectacles grew in size over the following decades: in 1876, one such ball was attended by over 4000 people. Feminist editor Victoria Woodhull condemned the sexual hypocrisy of the French balls in 1873 in Woodhull and Clafliin's Weekly, complaining that the Academy of Music was being used \\"for the purpose of debauching debauched women; and the trustees of the Academy know this.\\"Burrow & Wallace, p.1015 Still, it was the opera season that made the Academy the mainstay of social life for New Yorks \\"uppertens\\", and the oldest and most prominent families owned seats in the theater's boxes. This emblem of social prominence was passed down from generation to generation. The inability of New York's wealthy industrial and mercantile families, including the Vanderbilts, Goulds and Morgans, to gain access to this closed society inspired the creation of the new Metropolitan Opera Association in 1880. The trustees of the Academy belatedly attempted to head off the competition by offering to add 26 new boxes to the 18 the Academy already had, to accommodate the Vanderbilts, Morgans, Rockefellers who were behind the planned new venue, but it was too late to fend them off.Burrows & Wallace, p.1074 The Metropolitan's new opera house at Broadway and 39th Street, twice the size of the Academy, opened in 1883. It contained three tiers of elegant boxes to display the wealth of the city's new economic leaders. The new opera house was an instant success with New York society and music lovers alike, and the Academy of Music's opera season was canceled in 1886.Hamilton, David, ed. The Metropolitan Opera Encyclopedia. Simon and Schuster, New York. 1987. pp. 249‚Äì250. In 1888 the Academy began to offer vaudeville. The Drury Lane import The White Heather had a successful 148-performance run for the 1897-98 season. Between 1895 and 1899, Rev. Thomas Dixon, Jr., delivered sermons there. From January 28 to March 1901, a revival of Clyde Fitch's play Barbara Frietchie appeared there. The venue was rented by labor organizations in the early 1900s and used to stage rallies. In 1926 it was demolished, along with its neighbor Tammany Hall, for the construction of the Consolidated Edison Company Building. Movie theater On the south side of 14th Street across from the site of the opera house, a movie theatre opened in 1927 which took the name the Academy of Music. It was built as a 3,000-seat deluxe movie palace by movie mogul William Fox, and was designed by Thomas W. Lamb. It served as a venue for rock concerts in the 1960s and early 1970s, with its name being changed to \\"The Palladium\\" by promoter Ron Delsner in September 1976.Rockwell, John \\"Refurbished 14th St. Palladium Opens With Program by the Band\\" The New York Times (September 20, 1976) In 1985, it was converted into the Palladium nightclub, designed by Arata Isozaki.White & Willensky The theater was bought and demolished by New York University, and replaced by the present Palladium Residence Hall, which opened in 2001.

Costigan is renowned for presiding over the Costigan Commission into organised crime. Background and early life One of eight children, Costigan grew up in Preston, a suburb of Melbourne and was educated by the Jesuits at St Patrick's College, East Melbourne, and at the University of Melbourne, where he obtained a law degree. He was admitted as a solicitor in Victoria in 1953 and became a barrister in 1957. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel in Victoria in 1973, and was admitted to practise throughout Australia and in Ireland. Costigan was the twin brother of Michael Costigan, a writer and editor; and an older brother of Peter Costigan, Lord Mayor of Melbourne from 1999 to 2001. Messenger describes him as truly decent person who persevered in the \\"cesspool of politics\\" because that is where the most good can be done for the most people. Career Costigan was active in the campaign to reform the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. At the main Reform meeting held at the Festival Hall, in Dudley Street, Melbourne on 22 January 1971 Costigan was a central and active voice demanding reform of the party. At the beginning of this large meeting, chaired by Tom Burns, Jim Cairns, Bob Hawke and George Crawford, Costigan seconded a resolution moved by Dally Messenger III that members of the Victorian Labor Party should have equal say with the Unions in the decision making processes of the party. The resolution was disallowed by the chairman. On the second morning of this meeting Frank Costigan and his supporters, Brian, Max and Norma Edgar, Dally Messenger III, Gerry Cunningham, John Champion et alii, distributed the significant 50-50 leaflet, which ultimately led to a compromise motion moved by Bob Hogg that 60% control stayed with the unions and that branch members, who hitherto had had no representation, were to enjoy 40%. Paul Strangio strongly underscores this Intervention Reform meeting as crucial to the success of the Labor Party in Victoria. > \\"How do we explain Victorian Labor's changed fortunes over recent decades? > The transformation of Victorian Labor can be traced back to federal > intervention in the branch in 1970. During its long electoral drought that > followed the 1955 split, Victoria Labor was renowned as the most doctrinaire > and militant of the state Labor branches. Indeed, it was the Left > counterweight to the Right-dominated New South Wales branch. By the late > 1960s, forces within the ALP - both from outside and inside Victoria - led > by Gough Whitlam, were convinced that Victorian Labor's intransigence was > not only a stumbling block to the party's success in this state, but was > keeping federal Labor out of office. Hence the rationale for intervention. > Undoubtedly, intervention breathed new life into the Victorian ALP.\\" Costigan, along with a group of lawyers including John Button, John Cain, Xavier Connor QC, Barry Jones, and Richard McGarvie, formed a reform group called \\"The Participants\\", which challenged the undemocratic state executive for control of the party and supported the political agenda of then opposition leader, and later prime minister, Gough Whitlam. In 1980, Costigan was appointed by the Australian Government to chair the Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union (commonly called the Costigan Commission or the Costigan Royal Commission). The commission moved from the investigation of union criminality to allegations of tax evasion and organised crime. It also included a severe condemnation of the dishonesty, negligence and incompetence of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. Costigan was subsequently involved in Catholic campaigns for social justice. He was a director and deputy chair of Jesuit Social Services. Described by Scott as a \\"tough-minded crimefighter\\", in the 1998 Australian waterfront dispute he accused the Patrick Corporation of using the same \\"bottom of the harbour\\" corporate strategies as he had exposed in his Commission. Costigan later mainly practised in Alternative Dispute Resolution, either as an arbitrator or mediator. In 2005 he was appointed chairman of the Australian branch of Transparency International, an anti-corruption coalition. Personal Costigan was survived by five children and ten grandchildren.

He was nicknamed Blouz, probably because of his short stature. The little that has reached us of his voluminous works reveal an exceptionally gifted scholar, with treasured knowledge of vast scope. Living mostly in the latter part of the thirteenth century, he was also the last of the higher class of the Armenian authors of the ancient and medieval ages. Erznkatsi wrote hymns, commentaries, odes, eulogies, a Martyrology, an astronomical treatise on celestial elements, and a grammar. He was personally known and honored in almost every center of learning in Greater Armenia and Cilicia. An outstanding orator, he was the main speaker on the occasion of the conferring of knighthood on Hetoum and Thoros, sons of King Leon III, which was celebrated at Sis in 1284. Having studied Latin, apparently at an advanced age, he translated certain parts of the Theology of Thomas Aquinas into Armenian.

Since 1995, Clavia's keyboards have been branded Nord. Company history =Digital drums= In 1983, Hans Nordelius and Mikael Carlsson began to work in the basement of a home located in the southern suburbs of Stockholm, creating the world's first dedicated digital drum for the commercial market, called the 'Digital Percussion Plate 1'. In 1984 an improved version that could play four sounds from an EPROM was released under the 'ddrum' name with the now signature red coloring. The same year a drum system was released with several sound modules in a rack, each with its own EPROM. The pads used to trigger the sounds were unusual for the time, since they used real drum heads, whereas other electronic drum kits of the time used rubber pads. This, together with a separate trigger for the snare drum's rim, made for a more realistic playing experience. The ddrum brand and products were sold in 2005 to their US distributor Armadillo who continues to manufacture drum products under the name. =Nord keyboards= In 1995, Clavia released the Nord Lead. Called \\"a magic piece of electronics\\" by Sound on Sound it popularized the virtual analog type of synthesis. In 1997 the Nord Lead 2 was released, with many improvements, including increasing polyphony from 4 to 16 notes. The Nord Lead 3 was released in 2001, with a reworked sound engine, better D/A converters and monophonic aftertouch. The most striking aspect of the Nord Lead 3 was that all the sound editing knobs had been replaced with infinite rotary knobs, where the value of the parameter was indicated by a LED 'collar' around the knob. The rotary knobs, LED collars and keyboard with aftertouch made the Nord Lead 3 an \\"absolute delight\\" but because of its higher price, the Nord Lead 2 remained in demand. And as some of the parts of the Nord Lead 3 were getting harder to source, Clavia released an updated version of the Nord Lead 2, called the Nord Lead 2x, with faster processors, better D/A converters and an upgraded polyphony to 20 voices. The Nord Lead 3 was discontinued in 2007, but the Nord Lead 2x remains in production. In 1997 Clavia released the Nord Modular, a virtual analog modular synthesizer. Called a \\"landmark in synthesis\\" it allowed you to essentially build your own virtual analog synthesizer. It too was later upgraded with the 2004 release of the Nord Modular G2, that gave it the same endless rotary knobs as the Nord Lead 3 and a larger keyboard with aftertouch. In 2001 the Nord Electro was released. It was designed to emulate the classical electromechanical keyboards like the Hammond organ, the Rhodes Stage 73, the Wurlitzer electric piano and the Hohner Clavinet. The pianos are samples but the organs are modeled using a \\"digital simulation\\". Im 2005, Clavia produced the Nord Stage, combining the organ and piano functions of the Electro with some of the synth functionality of the Lead, while adding other piano functionality and a version with 88 weighted keys. In October 2007 Clavia released the Nord Wave, which adds sample-player functionality to the virtual analog engine of the Nord Lead series and in March 2012 Clavia released the Nord Drum, a virtual analog drum synthesizer. and the Nord C1 Organ, a dual manual instrument containing the organ section from the Nord Electro 3, to which an emulation of a baroque pipe organ was added in 2009. The Nord Piano was released in 2010, which contained the piano section from the Nord Electro 3 with an 88 key hammer action keyboard. Clavia has continued to update each of these models, and in 2019 the Nord range included the Nord Stage 3, the Nord Piano 4, the Nord Electro 6, the Nord Lead 4 and the Nord Lead A1.

Her firm \\"Pauline Pottery\\" moved to Edgerton in 1888. Although the move to Edgerton allowed the firm to expand, employing up to 40 people during its most active phase, the 1893 death of Pauline Jacobus' husband, businessman Oscar, and the simultaneous financial panic that spread across America that same year, doomed the struggling art pottery company. A studio phase of the pottery continued until Jacobus' rural Edgerton home, \\"The Bogart,\\" was destroyed in a fire in July 1911. Jacobus died at a Dousman, Wisconsin retirement home, neglected and forgotten in 1930. In 2005, a large collection of Pauline Pottery went on permanent display in a museum located in the former Edgerton 1906 train depot. The collection is owned by the Arts Council of Edgerton.

Some Armenian and European scholars, such as G. Alishan, O. Torosyan, G. Fintigliyan, A. Sarukhan, G. Ter-Mkrtchyan (Miaban), S.

He was a close friend of Eznik Koghbatsi and Ghevond. Later, he was appointed Bishop of Georgia. He has been listed among the junior translators. His style is original, but somewhat obscure due to grammatical irregularities. To him have been attributed the translations of the three apocryphal books of the Maccabees.

The Mumun period is known for the origins of intensive agriculture and complex societies in both the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago. This period or parts of it have sometimes been labelled as the \\"Korean Bronze Age\\", after Thomsen's 19th century three-age system classification of human prehistory. However, the application of such terminology in the Korean case is misleading since local bronze production did not occur until approximately the late 8th century BC at the earliest, bronze artifacts are rare, and the distribution of bronze is highly regionalized until after 300 BC. A boom in the archaeological excavations of Mumun Period sites since the mid-1990s has recently increased collective knowledge about this formative period in the prehistory of East Asia. The Mumun period is preceded by the Jeulmun Pottery Period (c. 8000-1500 BC). The Jeulmun was a period of hunting, gathering, and small-scale cultivation of plants. The origins of the Mumun Period are not well known, but the megalithic burials, Mumun pottery, and large settlements found in the Liao River Basin and North Korea c. 1800-1500 probably indicate the origins of the Mumun Period of Southern Korea. Slash-and-burn cultivators who used Mumun pottery displaced people using Jeulmun Period subsistence patterns. Chronology =Early Mumun= The Early (or Formative) Mumun (c. 1500-850 BC) is characterized by shifting cultivation, fishing, hunting, and discrete settlements with rectangular semi-subterranean pit-houses. The social scale of Early Mumun societies was egalitarian in nature, but the latter part of this period is characterized by increasing intra-settlement competition and perhaps the presence of part-time \\"big-man\\" leadership. Early Mumun settlements are relatively concentrated in the river valleys formed by tributaries of the Geum River in West-central Korea. However, one of the largest Early Mumun settlements, Eoeun (Hangeul: Ïñ¥ÏùÄ), is located in the Middle Nam River valley in South-central Korea. In the latter Early Mumun, large settlements composed of many long-houses such as Baekseok-dong (Hangeul: Î∞±ÏÑùÎèô) appeared in the area of modern Cheonan City, Chungcheong Nam-do. Important long-term traditions related to Mumun ceremonial and mortuary systems originated in this sub- period. These traditions include the construction of megalithic burials, the production of red-burnished pottery, and production of polished groundstone daggers. =Middle Mumun= Ganghwa dolmen, South Korea Large Middle Mumun (c. 8th century BC storage vessel unearthed from a pit-house in or near Daepyeong, H= c. 60-70 cm. The Middle (or Classic) Mumun (c. 850-550 BC) is characterized by intensive agriculture, as evidenced by the large and expansive dry-field remains (c. 32,500 square metres) recovered at Daepyeong, a sprawling settlement with several multiple ditch enclosures, hundreds of pit-houses, specialized production, and evidence of the presence of incipient elites and social competition. A number of wet-field features have been excavated in southern Korea, indicating that paddy field rice-farming was also practiced. Representations of a dagger (right)and two human figures, one of which is kneeling (left), carved into the capstone of Megalithic Burial No. 5, Orim-dong, Yeosu, Korea. Burials dating to the latter part of the Middle Mumun (c. 700-550 BC) contain a few high status mortuary offerings such as bronze artifacts. Bronze production probably began around this time in Southern Korea. Other high status burials contain greenstone (or jade) ornaments. A number of megalithic burials with deep shaft interments, substantial 'pavements' of rounded cobblestone, and prestige artifacts such as bronze daggers, jade, and red-burnished vessels were built in the vicinity of the southern coast in the Late Middle Mumun. High status megalithic burials and large raised-floor buildings at the Deokcheon-ni (Hangeul: ÎçïÏ≤úÎ¶¨) and Igeum-dong sites in Gyeongsang Nam-do provide further evidence of the growth of social inequality and the existence of polities that were organized in ways that appear to be similar to simple \\"chiefdoms\\". Korean archaeologists sometimes refer to Middle Mumun culture as Songguk-ri Culture (Hanja: ÊùæËèäÈáå ÊñáÂåñ; Hangeul: ÏÜ°Íµ≠Î¶¨ Î¨∏Ìôî). Co-occurring artifacts and features that are grouped together as Songguk-ri Culture are found in settlement sites in the Hoseo and Honam regions of southeast Korea, but Songguk-ri Culture settlements are also found in western Yeongnam. Excavations have also revealed Songguk-ri settlements in the Ulsan and Gimhae areas. In 2005 archaeologists uncovered Songguk-ri Culture pit-houses at a site deep in the interior of Gangwon Province. The ultimate geographic reach of Songguk-ri Culture appears to have been Jeju Island and western Japan. Mumun culture is the beginning of a long-term tradition of rice-farming in Korea that links Mumun Culture with the present day, but evidence from the Early and Middle Mumun suggests that, although rice was grown, it was not the dominant crop. During the Mumun people grew millets, barley, wheat, legumes, and continued to hunt and fish. Settlement sites of the Mumun Period that are mentioned in the text of this article. =Late Mumun= The Late (or Post-classic) Mumun (550-300 BC) is characterized by increasing conflict, fortified hilltop settlements, and a concentration of population in the southern coastal area. A Late Mumun occupation was found at the Namsan settlement, located on the top of a hill 100 m above sea level in modern Changwon City, Gyeongsang Nam-do. A shellmidden (shellmound) was found in the vicinity of Namsan, indicating that, in addition to agriculture, shellfish exploitation was part of the Late Mumun subsistence system in some areas. Pit-houses at Namsan were located inside a ring-ditch that is some 4.2 m deep and 10 m in width. Why would such a formidable ring-ditch, so massive in size, have been necessary? One possible answer is intergroup conflict. Archaeologists propose that the Late Mumun was a period of conflict between groups of people. The number of settlements in the Late Mumun is much lower than in the previous sub-period. This indicates that populations were reorganized and settlement was probably more concentrated in a smaller number of larger settlements. There are a number of reasons why this could have occurred. There are some indications that conflict increased or climatic change led to crop failures. Notably, according to the traditional Yayoi chronological sequence, Mumun-esque settlements appeared in Northern Ky≈´sh≈´ (Japan) during the Late Mumun. The Mumun period ends when iron appeared in the archaeological record along with pit-houses that had interior composite hearth-ovens reminiscent of the historic period (agungi). Some scholars suggest that the Mumun pottery period should be extended to 0 BC because of the presence of an undecorated ware that was popular between 400 BC and 0 BC called jeomtodae (). However, bronze became very important in ceremonial and elite life from 300 BC. Additionally, iron tools are increasingly found in Southern Korea after 300 BC. These factors clearly differentiate the time period 300 BC - 0 from the cultural, technological, and social scale that was present in the Mumun pottery period. The unequal presence of bronze and iron in increased amounts from a few high status graves after 300 BC as sets this time apart from the Mumun pottery period. It is thus that, as a cultural- technical period, the Mumun was finished by approximately 300 BC. From about 300 BC, bronze objects became the most valued prestige mortuary goods, but iron objects were traded and then produced in the Korean peninsula at that time. The Late Mumun-Early Iron Age Neuk-do Island Shellmidden Site yielded a small number of iron objects, Lelang and Yayoi pottery, and other evidence showing that beginning in the Late Mumun, local societies were drawn into closer economic and political contact with the societies of the Late Zhou Dynasty, Final J≈çmon, and Early Yayoi. Mumun cultural traits As an archaeological culture, the Mumun is composed of the following elements: = Languages = According to Juha Janhunen and Alexander Vovin, Japonic languages were spoken in parts of the Korean Peninsula before they were replaced by Koreanic speakers.Vovin, Alexander (2013). \\"From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean\\". Korean Linguistics. 15 (2): 222‚Äì240. Whitman (2012) suggests that the proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC and coexist with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later founder effect diminished the internal variety of both language families. =Subsistence= * Broad-spectrum subsistence was practiced through the Early Mumun. That is to say, evidence excavated from pit-houses and other outdoor household features indicates that hunting, fishing, and foraging was occurring in addition to agriculture. * stone tools used in agricultural subsistence activities are common and include semi-lunar blades. * Intensive wet-field agriculture (paddy farming) was in place in the Middle Mumun. However, even the pit-houses of settlements associated with wet-field archaeological features show evidence that people were also engaged to some degree in hunting and fishing. =Settlement= * Large rectangular-shaped pit-houses were used in Early Mumun. These pit-houses had one or more hearths, and pit-houses with up to 6 hearths indicate that such features were the living spaces for multiple generations of the same household. * Some time after 900 BC, small pit-houses were the norm. The plan- shape of these pit-houses are square, circular and oval. They do not have interior hearths ‚Äî instead, the central area of the pit-house floor is equipped with a shallow oval 'work-pit'. * Archaeologists see this change in architecture as a social shift in the household. Namely, the tight and multi- generational unit housed under one roof in the Early Mumun changed fundamentally into households formed of groups of semi-independent nuclear family units in separate pit-houses. * The average settlement in the Mumun was small, but settlements with as many as several hundred pit-houses emerged in the Middle Mumun. =Economy= * Household production was the basic mode of the Mumun economy, but specialized craft production and a big-man-style redistributive prestige economy emerged in the Middle Mumun. * Archaeological evidence has documented cases in which it appears that surplus production of crops, stone tools, and pottery occurred in the Middle Mumun. * Artifacts that illustrate regional redistributive systems and exchange include greenstone ornaments, bronze objects, and some kinds of red-burnished pottery. =Mortuary practices= * Megalithic burials, stone-cist burials, and jar burials are found. * Some burials in the latter part of the Middle Mumun are especially large and required a significant amount of labour to construct. A small number of Middle Mumun burials contain prestige/ceremonial artifacts such as bronze, greenstone, groundstone daggers, and red-burnished ware.

The directorial debut of Kevin Spacey as well as the screenwriting debut of Christian Forte, it stars Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, and Gary Sinise. It tells the story of three small-time criminals who take hostages after being cornered by the police. The title refers to an anecdote told in the film, claiming that alligators will use an albino among them as sacrifice, so that the opposing alligators will be distracted and become prey themselves. Plot Brothers Dova (Matt Dillon) and Milo (Gary Sinise) are small-time crooks. They and their partner, Law (William Fichtner), pull a holdup in New Orleans that goes terribly wrong. A police officer is killed, as are two other men. The robbers flee to a local bar, Dino's Last Chance, desperately taking everyone inside hostage. Milo is seriously wounded and bleeding. Law is a sociopath who is ready and willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Dova is their leader, trying to keep the situation calm while federal agents, led by Browning (Joe Mantegna), surround the bar. A bar employee, Janet (Faye Dunaway), tries but fails to reason with the intruders. Her boss, Dino, behind the bar, secretly has a shotgun that he is hoping to get a chance to use. He does‚Äîgrabbing Law and holding it on him, but Law gets the upper hand and bludgeons him. Besides a barfly (John Spencer) who is barely coherent and a younger man, Danny (Skeet Ulrich) shooting pool, there is one other customer (Viggo Mortensen), a man named Foucard dressed in a business suit, who is strangely silent and inactive all his time there. As the life of Milo slips away and the robbers' demands to the cops go unmet, Dova decides whether to surrender or start letting Law shoot hostages one at a time. Law is especially terrified of going back to prison. Dova and Law prepare to take Danny as a hostage. But Janet pleads them not to as he is her son. It is revealed that Foucard is a wanted fugitive and the police really want him. Dova and Law prepare to give Foucard to the police and pretend that Foucard is the kidnapper and they are the hostages. Milo has Dova and Law swear on their mothers that they will not kill anyone. But when painted into a corner, Law is more than ready to kill and Dova agrees. Milo wants no more of it all and prepares to turn himself in. Dova holds a gun on him to keep him there. When Dova and Law leave, Milo takes the knife he was given off a hostage and uses it to finish himself off. Dova finds out and is in tears. They prepare to give the police the wanted Foucard. The police finally storm the place and opening fire on people, including Law and Foucard. Dova and the real hostages are allowed to vacate. Janet covers for Dova as he kept Law from killing the rest of the hostages. Dova is traumatized.

Produced since 1966 by Shure Incorporated, it has built a strong reputation among musicians for its durability and sound, and half a century later it is still considered the industry standard for live vocal performance microphones.Live Sound International, September/October 2002. Real World: Wired Vocal Microphones The SM58 and its sibling, the SM57, are the best-selling microphones in the world. The SM stands for Studio Microphone.History of Shure Incorporated Like all directional microphones, the SM58 is subject to proximity effect, a low frequency boost when used close to the source. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback onstage. There are wired (with and without on/off switch) and wireless versions. The wired version provides balanced audio through a male XLR connector. The SM58 uses an internal shock mount to reduce handling noise. A distinctive feature of the SM58 is its pneumatic suspension system for the microphone capsule. The capsule, a readily replaceable component, is surrounded by a soft rubber balloon, rather than springs or solid rubber. This gives notably good isolation from handling noise; one reason for its being a popular microphone for stage vocalists. Microphones with this feature are intended primarily for hand-held use, rather than on a stand or for instrument miking. The SM58 is unswitched, while the otherwise identical SM58S has a sliding on-off switch on the body. Other suffixes refer to any accessories supplied with the microphone: when a cable is provided, the model is actually SM58-CN, while the SM58-LC has no provided cable; the SM58-X2u kit consists of the SM58-LC and an inline X2u XLR-to-USB signal adaptor (capable of providing phantom power for condenser microphones, and offering an in-built headphone jack for monitoring).

It is one of the best-selling microphones in the world. It is used extensively in amplified music and has been used for speeches by every U.S. president since its introduction in 1965.TECnology Hall of Fame: 2004 In 2004, honoring its four decades of \\"solid, dependable performance\\", it was inducted into the first-ever TEC Awards TECnology Hall of Fame. Background The origin of SM57 may be traced to 1937, when Shure engineer Benjamin Bauer developed the first single-element directional microphone, the Unidyne, which had a cardioid pickup pattern. In 1959, another Shure engineer, Ernie Seeler, advanced the art of microphone design significantly with the Unidyne III. Seeler torture-tested the Unidyne III during three years of research and development and thereby, produced the SM series of rugged and reliable Shure microphone capsules. The \\"SM\\" stands for Studio Microphone;History of Shure Incorporated Seeler was an aficionado of classical music and expected the SM57 to be used for orchestras. Because he \\"despised\\" rock music, the TEC Foundation said that it was ironic that the microphone has become \\"a mainstay of rock music.\\" Characteristics The SM57 uses the same capsule as the popular SM58. Like the SM58, the SM57 is fitted with an XLR connector and features a balanced output, which helps to minimize electrical hum and noise pickup. According to Shure, the frequency response extends from 40 Hertz (Hz) to 15 kHz. The SM57 is manufactured in the United States, Mexico, and China. The Shure A2WS is an accessory windscreen for the SM57 that attenuates wind noise and plosives (\\"pop\\" sounds), and protects the microphone capsule. Use Shure SM57 microphones with A2WS windscreens installed on the lectern of former United States President Barack Obama. The microphone kit (two SM57 microphones, windscreens, microphone stands, and black right-angle XLR cables) is referred to as the VIP/high-profile microphone kit. The SM57 is a popular choice of musicians due to its sturdy construction and ability to work well with instruments that produce high sound pressure levels, such as percussion instruments and electric guitars. The School of Audio Engineering (SAE) recommends the SM57 (along with other makes and models) for four roles in a drum kit: kick drum, snare drum, rack toms, and floor tom. The cardioid pickup pattern of the microphone reduces the pickup of unwanted background sound and the generation of acoustic feedback. SM57s have also been a staple when reinforcing the sound from guitar amplifiers. Every U.S. president since Lyndon B. Johnson has delivered speeches through an SM57. It became the lectern microphone of the White House Communications Agency in 1965, the year of its introduction, and remains so. Due to its popularity, the SM57 has been counterfeited frequently by manufacturers in China and Thailand.Home Recording.

The tournament typically occurs during the second weekend of January. The school who wins that year's tournament often wins the year's Deaf Prep National Championship. Laurent Clerc? Laurent Clerc was born on December 26, 1785. An accident struck him at a young age: one side of his face was burnt after he fell into a fireplace. The fever resulting from the burnt ended with Clerc becoming Deaf. Clerc had such devoted parents who sought various medicinal cures before learning about the Royal Institution for the Deaf in Paris, France. Clerc‚Äôs parents enrolled him at the school where he was put under the guidance of the school‚Äôs director, Abbe Roche-Ambroise Sicard. The school utilized sign language as the language of instruction which allowed many of Clerc‚Äôs hidden talents to emerge. Clerc completed his study in seven years and was rewarded with the position of assistant teacher, in charge of the highest class at the Institution. He eventually moved up as teacher. An event happened in 1816 during Clerc‚Äôs eight year of teaching which changed his life forever. He met a young idealist from America, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, who was searching for an educational system for the Deaf. Gallaudet then observed Clerc working with students during numerous situations. Gallaudet ultimately asked Clerc to help him established the first school for the Deaf in America. Clerc accepted and bade farewell to his family, friends, and boss. Gallaudet and Clerc set sail from France on June 18, 1816. During the 52-day voyage, they continued to share their knowledge with each other. Upon arrival in America, Clerc and Gallaudet began fundraising efforts by having Clerc present on instruction methods for the Deaf with Gallaudet assisting as interpreter. They traveled along the east coast, from Boston to Philadelphia, for nearly seven months. They taught and interviewed parents of Deaf children, garnering community support at the same time. Their efforts paid off with the establishment of the first school for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut on April 15, 1817. Clerc taught there for the next 41 years providing lessons in sign language and teacher training. Clerc married a former pupil, Elizabeth Broadman, and fathered four children. Clerc died on July 18, 1869. Deaf people's lives nowadays would not have been possible without Laurent Clerc. As the first Deaf teacher in America, he contributed greatly towards the development of American Sign Language and deaf education.

He graduated from UCSB in 1993 with a B.A. degree in English literature. Elliot worked as a stringer for the Santa Barbara News-Press. He then moved on to graduate school at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, where he earned a Master of Science degree in 1999. He worked in television as a producer for Galaxy Productions before moving onto 20th Century Fox. He began there in comedy development and later worked in physical production. After graduating from Columbia, Elliott worked for Sports Illustrated for six years, covering events in most major sports.Josh Elliott's Biography Career =ESPN career= Elliott on the set of SportsCenter Elliott first joined ESPN in 2004 as a panelist for Around the Horn and Jim Rome Is Burning, as well as serving as guest co-host for Cold Pizza on ESPN2. On ESPN Classic, Elliott hosted the short-lived Classic Now, which aired from June 2005 to March 2006. He also started appearing as a co-anchor on ESPNEWS and reporting for SportsCenter. After Classic Now was canceled, Elliott began contributing to ESPN the Magazine and ESPN.com. When ESPN began airing SportsCenter live every weekday morning on August 11, 2008, Elliott was paired as an anchor with Hannah Storm for the first three hours of the programming block beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET. =Good Morning America= In May 2011, Elliott joined the team at ABC's Good Morning America following the departure of previous news anchor Juju Chang. He also started as a substitute anchor on the weekend edition of ABC World News, debuting on May 21, 2011. Joined by Lara Spencer, he also anchored Good Afternoon America, an afternoon spin-off broadcast from July 9 to September 7, 2012 as a temporary replacement for ABC's cancelled talk show The Revolution. =NBC= On March 30, 2014, it was announced by ABC News President Ben Sherwood that Elliott had signed a contract with NBC, and would depart ABC News and Good Morning America. Amy Robach was announced as his immediate replacement. With NBC, Elliott made $4 million per year, but a six-month non- compete clause prohibited him from appearing on news-related programming, relegating him primarily to NBC Sports programming such as the 2014 Kentucky Derby‚Äîwhere he made his on-air debut. Upon his hiring, it was believed that NBC was contemplating Elliott to serve as a future host of Today; in response, he told the press that he \\"[hoped] Matt Lauer is here when I step away from this gig 30 years down the road. I can tell you that the only discussions I have had, as they relate to news, [are] ways to supply sports content to them.\\" Elliott would, eventually, serve as a sports correspondent for the program. In December 2015, it was reported that Elliott had left NBC. = CBS = On March 1, 2016, CBS News announced that it had hired Elliott to serve as the lead anchor for its digital news service CBSN. Of the hiring, CBS News president David Rhodes explained that Elliott needed an \\"outlet\\", going on to say that \\"we're going to need from him as much as he can bring in these different areas of reporting and anchoring. It's another reason it's the perfect place for him because it‚Äôs kind of unlimited. We have some really hard-working people at CBSN, but we don't have enough of them.\\" On February 10, 2017, Elliott announced on-air that he would be leaving CBSN, but stated that \\"knowing how things work around here, I may see you again on Monday morning\\". Elliott had been told by an executive that CBS had desired to place him in a larger role as a field correspondent, under which he would have filed reports for CBS's television news programs. However, CBS executives were caught off-guard by the abrupt announcement, and were unaware of any plans for him to be promoted from CBSN. On February 13, 2017, Elliott was fired. =Other work= Elliott received a local Emmy Award in New York City in 2005 for writing and contributing to Angles on MSG Network and served as one of the co-hosts for Super Bowl XL for Westwood One Sports. In 2018, Elliott co-hosted Yellowstone Live on National Geographic Channel with wildlife expert Chris Packham, a four-night event showcasing the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem with feeds from dozens of live cameras and seven camera crews.https://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/yellowstone-live/ Personal life Elliott is divorced from Priya Narang, with whom he has a daughter.

The organization is classified as Orthodox by several organizations and government institutions, including the government of the Serbian province of Vojvodina and the Serbian Ministry of Interior. On 12 June 2012 Obraz was officially banned by the Constitutional Court of Serbia. While swearing allegiance to the Serbian nation and to the Serbian Orthodox religion, Obraz is committed to a struggle against those groups which it views as enemies of the Orthodox Serbian people, such as \\"Zionists (which they also include Kabbalists, Manichaeists, Freemasons and Illuminati), Ustashe (mainly Croatian nationalists), Muslim extremists (mainly Bosniak nationalists), Albanian terrorists (mainly Albanian nationalists), false pacifists (mainly Serbian human rights activists and NGOs), political partisans, sectarians (religious sects), perverts (which they include pedophiles and LGBT population), drug addicts and criminals (mainly Serbian mafia)\\". The movement‚Äôs ideology is mainly influenced by Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá, Dimitrije Ljotiƒá and the Yugoslav National Movement Zbor. Activities In late 2001 they staged the First Assembly of the Orthodox-National Youth at the Belgrade University after 1944. Participants in the Assembly were members of society ‚ÄúSveti Justin Filozof‚Äù, Serbian Assembly \\"Dveri\\", and the Serbian Orthodox priests. However most emphasised was the ‚ÄúSpiritual vertical of the Serb history and Serb people‚Äù. The rally underlined the spiritual authority of Justin Popoviƒá and Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá and urged creation of the Serb state in line with their ideas. There were many priests and also girls dressed in Serb folk-costumes. The Assembly also called on reconciliation between followers of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, and dissemination of their ideas in schools. Obraz praised war criminal indictees Ratko Mladiƒá and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá: \\"We salute the last of Serb heroes! Gen. Ratko Mladiƒá [...] and Dr. Radovan Karad≈æiƒá [...] led Bosnian Serbs in their fight for survival; we thank the great men for their sacrifices with a hope that our pages will strike a spark of inspiration for future generations.\\" According to Professor Dr. Ljubi≈°a Rajiƒá, the message on the Obraz' web site: \\"re-hashes old ideas of Svetosavlje, which attach primary importance to assembly-making, monarchy, clericalism, conservatism, and patriarchal culture. Moreover those ideas are currently openly espoused by contemporary ideologues of Serb nationalism, the far-right parties and some Serbian Orthodox priests‚Äù. \\"We are waiting for you!\\", a message to participants of the 2009 Belgrade Gay Pride Parade that was ultimately banned by the state.

Legal status On 28 February 2009, the Human and Minority Rights Ministry of Serbia sought to close Obraz and submitted an initiative to look into the legality of its work. In 2011, Obraz was submitted to the constitutional court of Serbia to be forbidden as an extremist organization and to prevent its registration under a different name. The leader of this organization Mladen Obradoviƒá is accused for calls for lynch of the LGBT population in Serbia in 2009 and 2010. He was convicted for 10 months sentence for LGBT bashing at the pride parade in 2009. He was also convicted for 2 years for the same crimes at the 2010 pride parade.

It has been suggested that it was first produced in the Interior Salish territory of British Columbia which was located in the upper basins of the Columbia and Fraser rivers, and included tribes such as the Columbia, Lillooet, Shuswap among others.Salish. (2016). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/topic/Salish  Ingredients  The typical ingredient list for Indian ice cream includes: * soapberries * water * some kind of sweetener Sugar is added as needed; the bitterness or sweetness of the berries can vary greatly between bushes, with bitter berries requiring the addition of more sugar.  Soapberry  Shepherdia canadensis RFA soapberry bush is generally described as a small to medium-sized, deciduous, broad-topped tree to 30' tall (max. 45') with pinnately compound leaves, clusters of flowers and a yellowish translucent fruit. Soapberries are part of the Elaeagnaceae Family. They are typically found scattered throughout the United States (but are rarely abundantly) in a wide range of soils, along stream bottoms, forest margins, and disturbed areas; southwestern U.S., south-central Plains; northern Mexico.Turner, Matt Warnock. 01/01/2009. Remarkable plants of Texas : Uncommon accounts of our common natives: Soapberry. : 95 Unrelated plants in the genus Sapindus produce highly toxic saponins and share the common name soapberry with the edible Canada buffaloberry. Other names for this soapberry include: * Western soapberry * wild china (-berry) * Indian soap-plant * jaboncilio * amole de bolita * Canada buffaloberry * russet buffaloberry * foamberry * soopolallie * cherioni  Sweeteners  Salal berries = Sweet Berries =  Salal Berries  One of the most common sweeteners used with Indian ice cream was salal berries (Gaultheria shallon). The main reason for this is that it was always available and always delivered a sweet flavour.  Thimbleberries  Rubus parviflorus, most commonly known as thimbleberry, was extensively harvested by the First Nations peoples for their deliciously sweet taste. They were added to teas or cakes and, of course, Indian ice cream. = Mild Sweeteners = Chamerion angustifolium 2012 G1  Fireweed  First Nations peoples, such as the Coast Tsimshian people, regularly use Chamerlon angustifolium, most commonly known as fireweed, as sweeteners in Indian ice cream. They would also use the outer part of the stem as a whipper for the soapberries. The roots of the Fireweed gives off a bitter taste but the petals have a spicy sweet taste. The petals would be the part that is harvested for making sweeteners.  Camas Bulb  The Camas bulb is part of the herb Cammassia quamash, for which First Nations peoples had many different uses. After the bulb is baked or boiled, it can be eaten like a baked sweet potato but with a sweeter taste. This can then be crushed and mixed together with the whipped Sxusem to give it a sweeter taste and a more solid texture. = Modern Sweeteners =  Cane Sugar  When sugar was introduced by the first European traders, it changed the eating habits of coastal First Nations people as it was a unique taste to them and it later became a treasured ingredient. It was mixed with Indian ice cream but it was said that too much would ruin the flavour.  Whipping process  The Thompson tribe used timbergrass (Calamoagrostis rubescens) to both dry and whip the berries as well as using the Rocky Mountain Maple bark as beaters. Some tribes have also whipped soapberries with bunches of inner cedar bark, thimbleberry branches or salal branches in birch bark bowls. It takes about 10 minutes to whip them this way, if you are whipping briskly.Evaluation of foam properties of saponin from Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil. (Aquifoliaceae) fruits. Scotti do Canto et al. The berries are placed into a great bowl that is absolutely free of oil or fat and are mixed with a sweetener. The mixture of berries is crushed and vigorously beaten in the manner of whipping cream in order to raise the typical foam of the sxusem confection. Similar to whipping egg whites, foaming is reduced in the presence of lipid contamination (grease, egg yolk, etc.). Foam depends on the ability of the surfactant (saponins in soapberries, denatured proteins in egg whites) molecules to bind with each other and create a hydrophobic interaction at the interface. When lipids are present, they interfere with this interaction and reduce the viscoelasticity of the foam.  Nutrition  In 125mL (100g) of Indian ice cream, an average of all common recipes, there are 37g of fat, 7g of protein, 130 mg of calcium, and small traces of iron, vitamin A, thiamin, and riboflavin. 125mL (50g) of soapberries contain only 1g protein, 10 mg calcium and traces of fats. To achieve the above nutritional profile, the Indian ice cream recipe used likely has added ingredients which differ from the traditional recipe which could include milk, eggs, nuts and dried fruit.  Consumption  The consistency of the dessert ranges from a thin, frothy liquid to a thick foam, which is determined by the amount of water added to the recipe. First Nations that originate from the Pacific Northwest, Oregon, Upper Tanana, and Flathead regions prefer to use larger amounts of water to attain a frothy drink. Areas like Clallam, Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, Bella Coola, and Alaska are more familiar with an ice cream-like consistency of their dessert, which comes from using small volumes, or even no water in their recipes. One variation of the recipe includes adding snow flavoured with smoked mountain goat fat after whipping the berries to give additional flavor. To prepare this, fresh snow is packed into a porous basket and hung high off the ground. Directly beneath it, fat is placed on the surface of a red-hot rock. As the smoke from the cooking of the fat rises to the basket, the snow is steeped with the fragrance of mountain goat fat. Modern variations may include the addition of fruits, such as bananas or raspberries, after whipping to increase the dessert‚Äôs sweetness.  Over-consumption  When consumed in large quantities, saponins can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and in extreme cases paralysis and death. Toxicity is extremely rare, however, with the LD50 dose lying between 50‚Äì100 mg/kg and the typical intake of UK family members at 15 mg per day. The effects of long term exposure can include hypertension, flaccid quadriplegia and hypokalkaemia among others. It is unlikely that Indian ice cream would be consumed in such large quantities as to cause these conditions. Given that Indian ice cream is composed primarily of trapped air, a more likely consequence of over-consumption is aerophagia, the abdominal discomfort that comes from swallowing too much air. A technique involving blowing bubbles with the ice cream in your mouth is said to reduce the likelihood of aerophagia (D. Alexcee, personal communication, March 16, 2016).  Harvesting  Soapberry plants exist as either male or female plants, however only the females produce berries. When soapberries are ripe for harvest, they will possess a variety of defining features. The first is color, being shades between that of orange and red and marginally translucent. The second feature that should be observed before harvesting is the size of the soapberry. A ripe soapberry is about 1/4-inch or less in diameter. The third defining characteristic of a ripe soapberry is its texture. If crushed, the ripe berries will produce a soapy foam. Finally, taste can be used as a measure of ripeness. Deemed by its bitter effects on the palate, a soapberry can be considered ready for harvest via taste. Soapberries are harvested in dry areas during the summer months of July, August, and September. Once ripe, soapberries are harvested not by handpicking them off the bush, but by use of a branch as a tool for knocking the ripe berries onto a collecting blanket below the bush. This method ensures that only the berries possessing the previously mentioned characteristics are collected for use.  Saponins  = Role in Biology = Saponins are the chemical compound which give soapberries their bitter taste and distinctive foaming abilities. As a component in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits of the shrub, it serves as protection against the growth of bacteria and fungus, as well as the foraging by insects and small animals. Herniaria Saponin I = Role in Colloidal Dispersions: Foam = Saponins are composed of polar sugar groups and non- polar groups of either steroids or triterpenes. This allows saponins, like other surfactants, to reduce the interfacial (or surface) tension found at the oil-water or air-water interface. In Indian ice cream, the reduced interfacial tension stabilizes the foam, greatly enhancing the foamability of the aqueous solution. In this capacity, it is the saponins found in soapberries that allow the formation of Indian ice cream. Like beating an egg white, agitating the soap berries introduces air into solution. Without a surfactant like the denatured proteins of egg whites or in this case, saponins, the air would quickly escape and the mixture would return to a solution. However, by stabilizing the interface of the dispersed and continuous phases of the foam, the air remains trapped in the agitated berry solution. When compared to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), a common synthetic detergent, saponins achieved only 37% of SLS foam height but a similar resistance to decay after being formed. This suggests that some properties of saponin foams are comparable to synthetic foams.  Additional uses  Saponin extraction can be executed in many ways. One of the most common soapberry processing method begins by crushing the berries, then soaking them in water, followed by treating the soapberry liquid with an aerated floating process which produces bubbles. Finally, the bubbles may be collected and left to set to form saponin extract. This saponin extract can then be used for many additional purposes. Soapberries have multiple uses besides that of a key ingredient in the popular Indian ice cream. Such uses include detergent for laundry, shampoo and soap. Soapberries can act as industrial emulsifiers, moistening agents, or foaming agents, and thus can be used as ingredients in multiple products for hygiene purposes. Saponins from natural sources like soapberries are currently approved for beverages in the EU to stabilize some beverage foams. Furthermore, some pharmacological effects, such as molluscicidal anti- inflammatory, antimicrobial, anthelmintic, antidermatophytic, antitussives and cytotoxic activities have been demonstrated in the saponins of plants.  Storage  Traditionally, soapberries were sun dried and stored in cedar boxes layered with thimbleberry leaves for protection. In the present, they can be frozen in well packed containers or canned in tin through thermal processing. Containers used to store these berries were not used for cooking or any other purposes to ensure grease would not come in contact with them.

Choirs The North American Choral Company, known to its members as the NACC, comprises five main choirs, and one special ensemble. Vox Animosa was formed of the remnants of Vox Vivida and Senior Company, and therefore the choir for elementary students. Singers practice and gain experience and confidence in singing multiple parts‚Äîmostly 2 or 3 part harmonies. The Vox Animosa uniform is pink or orange tunic top and black pants for girls, while boys wear a black shirt and black pants The Vox Lumina choir is made up of those who have recently been judged by the artistic director to be between the level of the Midwest Chorale and the Caritas choir. This group is the newest group in the North American Choral Company, having been formed in the summer of 2006. They mostly perform pop-influenced pieces. While their formal uniforms are black dresses, Vox Lumina members usually wear sparkly tunic tops and black pants. Vox Nova is an advanced chamber ensemble for older singers.

Plot Murdoch Troon (Stanley Baxter) is a dour Scot living and working for a local government authority somewhere in south London. A shy young man, his main excitement comes from cycling. After he's forced off the road by an impatient car driver, he tracks down the owner, only to find that he is Commander Chingford (James Robertson Justice), the domineering and acerbic owner of a sports car distributorship. Chingford reluctantly pays for the damage to Murdoch's cycle, but more significantly, Murdoch meets Claire (Julie Christie), Chingford's beautiful blonde daughter. He is smitten with her and, after she tells him she loves sports cars and would love to have one but \\"her great dictator\\" (meaning her father) won't allow it. Even though he can not drive, he is talked into buying a car to impress her by Murdoch's friend and fellow lodger, Freddie Fox (Leslie Phillips), a used car salesman and serial cad. Freddie sees a chance to ingratiate himself with Chingford and also to sell Murdoch a car. The car is a 1927 vintage Bentley 4¬Ω Litre Red Label Speed model, painted in British Racing Green and named The Fast Lady. Murdoch has his first driving lesson in a less exciting car, an Austin A40 Farina, which proves to be a comedy of disasters with a nervous instructor (Eric Barker). Freddie then makes a deal with Murdoch and offers to teach him, but the results are equally disastrous. Unwilling to give up, and determined to prove his love for Claire, Murdoch bets her father that he can drive the car. An experienced racing driver, Chingford is convinced that Murdoch has no hope of achieving this ‚Äî and bets him that he cannot. Murdoch takes Chingford for a drive in the Bentley and loses the bet. But the tables are turned when Chingford loses Murdoch's counter-bet that Chingford cannot drive back home in less than 30 minutes. He then reluctantly allows Claire to go out with Murdoch in the car. The day comes for Murdoch's driving test. Freddie has set him up with a 'bent' examiner, but Murdoch draws the 'wrong' examiner. As the test comes to an end (and the examiner is almost certainly going to fail Murdoch), the car is commandeered by police to chase a Jaguar car driven by escaping bank robbers. The high speed chase takes them through town and country, across a golf course (leaving in its wake, a trail of disasters) and eventually the robbers are caught. Chingford so admires his driving skill that he allows the couple to get engaged. The film features cameos and performances by many well- known comedy and character actors, including Dick Emery as a car salesman, Clive Dunn, Gerald Campion, Frankie Howerd, Bernard Cribbins, Bill Fraser, 'Monsewer' Eddie Gray and Fred Emney. A racing sequence also features brief appearances by drivers John Surtees and Graham Hill, along with Raymond Baxter and celebrated automotive journalist John Bolster. Note: The 'Fast Lady' is a 1927 Bentley 4.5-litre Red Label Speed model with Vanden Plas short chassis fabric body, registration number TU5987. It was sold by a specialist dealer in 2010.

The server transmits enough data about its internal state to allow its connected clients to maintain their own accurate version of the game world for display to players. They also receive and process each player's input.  Types  = Dedicated server = Dedicated servers simulate game worlds without supporting direct input or output, except that required for their administration. Players must connect to the server with separate client programs in order to see and interact with the game. The foremost advantage of dedicated servers is their suitability for hosting in professional data centers, with all of the reliability and performance benefits that entails. Remote hosting also eliminates the low-latency advantage that would otherwise be held by any player who hosts and connects to a server from the same machine or local network. Dedicated servers cost money to run, however. Cost is sometimes met by a game's developers (particularly on consoles) and sometimes by clan groups, but in either case, the public is reliant on third parties providing servers to connect to. For this reason, most games which use dedicated servers also provide listen server support. Players of these games will oftentimes host servers for the public and their clans, either by hosting a server instance from their own hardware, or by renting from a game server hosting provider. = Listen server = Listen servers run in the same process as a game client. They otherwise function like dedicated servers, but typically have the disadvantage of having to communicate with remote players over the residential internet connection of the hosting player. Performance is also reduced by the simple fact that the machine running the server is also generating an output image. Furthermore, listen servers grant anyone playing on them directly a large latency advantage over other players and cease to exist when that player leaves the game. However, listen servers have the advantage of being essentially free and not requiring any special infrastructure or forward planning to set up, which makes them common at LAN parties where latency and bandwidth issues are not a concern. They are also common in console games.  Host migration  In a listen server arrangement, \\"host migration\\" is a useful feature. Without host migration, if the player that is currently hosting disconnects for any reason (quitting, crashing, lost network connection, etc.), the current server stops functioning and gameplay ends. A host migration feature allows one of the other players to become designated as the new host, so that the game can continue. = Peer-to- Peer = In the client/server model outlined elsewhere in this article, clients receive processed data from the server and display it without much thought. In the alternative \\"peer-to-peer\\" model there is no server: each \\"peer\\" instead receives the raw input streams of each other player and determines the results itself. Peer-to-peer is generally considered obsolete for action games, but it still common in the real-time strategy genre due to its suitability for games with large numbers of tokens and small numbers of players. Instead of constantly transmitting the positions of 1000 troops, the game can make a one-off transmission of the fact that 1000 troops are selected and that the player in command of them just issued a move order. However, peer-to-peer has many disadvantages: * It is very difficult to keep all peers synchronized. Minute differences between peers can escalate over time to game- breaking paradoxes. * It is very difficult to support new peers joining part- way through a game. * Each peer must communicate with all other peers, limiting the number of connected players. * Each peer must wait for every other peer's message before simulating the next \\"network frame\\", resulting in all players experiencing the same latency as the player with the worst connection. = Listen-peer = Multiple listen servers collectively peer amongst themselves for listen-peer setting. This type of setting avoids the disadvantages of peer-to-peer communications among all clients and is a better alternative to dedicated servers for increased number of clients.  Tickrate  The rate at which a game server runs simulation steps is commonly referred to as its \\"tickrate\\". A \\"tick\\" is a number associated with each simulation step which is broadcast to clients to help them synchronise with the server. There are three reasons to limit the frequency of server simulation steps to a predefined tickrate: to conserve server and client bandwidth, to conserve server CPU time, and to allow clients to be certain of how much time has elapsed between each tick. The last point is important for internet games, as network updates from the server can arrive at different intervals or even an incorrect order.  Customization  Servers, particularly those of PC games, can generally be customized in ways that still allow unaltered clients to connect to them. These customizations can include tweaks to built-in game settings, content that is downloaded by clients when they join the game, and new code which changes the way that the server behaves. While server customization is popular with server administrators and players, it can be at odds with the desire of developers and other players for the game to be experienced as intended. It can also aggravate players by enabling abusive administrators to lie about what their server offers.

Khrizantema was designed to deal with current and future generations of main battle tanks and can also be used to engage slow and low flying aerial targets like helicopters. The 9M123 missile together with its associated guidance system forms the 9K123 missile system. Development The Khrizantema anti-tank missile was unveiled in July 1996 by the Konstruktorskoye Byuro Mashynostroyenia (KB Mashinostroyeniya - KBM) Engineering Design Bureau. The missile had started development in the 1980s and was designed as an all weather, multi-purpose missile system that could defeat current and future armoured units equipped with advanced armour protection, such as Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA). Khrizantema was envisaged as a replacement for a variety of different types of anti-tank missiles that remained in service with the Russian military, such as the 9K114 Shturm and the 9M120 Ataka-V. The system entered service with the Russian armed forces in 2005. Description The 9M123 missile is supersonic, flying at an average speed of 400 m/s or Mach 1.2 and has a range of between 400 and 6,000 meters. Propulsion is achieved by way of a single solid fuel rocket motor with two exhausts on either side of the missile. The off-set exhausts cause the missile to spin during flight. Guidance control is provided by two pop-out control surfaces at the rear of the missile. Four additional surfaces, just in front of the controls, help stabilize the missile during flight. The Khrizantema is unique among Russian anti-tank guided missiles as, depending on the variant of the missile, it can either be guided by laser or radar. The radar unit uses the millimeter wave band and the system automatically tracks the target and guides the missile in the radar beam; this form of guidance is LOSBR (Line-Of- Sight Beam Riding) that is ACLOS (Automatic Command to Line-Of-Sight). When guided using a laser, a continuous laser beam is generated towards the target and a sensor in the rear section enables the missile to ride the laser beam to the target; this form of guidance is LOSBR that is SACLOS (Semi-Automatic Command to Line-Of-Sight). This dual guidance system allows two missiles to be fired at two separate targets at once, with one missile guided by laser and the other by radar. Each missile carries a tandem HEAT warhead with a reported penetration of 1100‚Äì1250 mm RHA (Rolled Homogeneous Armour) behind ERA. Alternatively, a thermobaric warhead can be carried to engage soft-skinned targets, fortifications and manpower. 9P157-2 \\"Khrizantema-S\\" variant of the BMP-3 It is currently launched from the 9P157-2 Khrizantema-S tank destroyer, Mi-28 Havoc attack helicopter and most likely in the near future from the Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopter as well. The 9P157-2 Khrizantema-S is based on the BMP-3 chassis. The 9P157-2 carries two 9M123 missiles on launch rails, which are extended from a stowed position, the radar is also stowed during transit. Missiles are re-loaded automatically by the tank destroyer from an internal magazine with 15 rounds (missiles are stored and transported in sealed canisters) and can also accept munitions manually loaded from outside the vehicle. The manufacturer claims that three 9P157-2 tank destroyers are able to engage 14 attacking tanks and destroy at least sixty percent of the attacking force. The dual guidance system ensures protection against electronic countermeasures and operation in all climatic conditions, day or night. NBC protection is provided for the crew (gunner and driver) of each 9P157-2 in addition to full armour protection equivalent to the standard BMP-3 chassis and entrenching equipment. Trials of a modernized version completed in 2016. On the upgraded version were installed an IIR/TV sight with a laser rangefinder, a modified radar control system, an increased secrecy laser beam- riding channel, an automated battle management equipment set and a more powerful warhead for the 9M123 missile among others.http://kbm.ru/en/press- centre/829.html Variants *9M123 - Laser guidance with tandem HEAT warhead. *9M123-2 - Radar guidance with tandem HEAT warhead. *9M123F - Laser guidance with thermobaric warhead. *9M123F-2 - Radar guidance with thermobaric warhead. *9M123 Khrizantema-M - Upgraded version with extended range and combination of wave radar along with laser beam riding guidance. *9M123 Khrizantema-VM - Air to surface version for helicopters.

Life Born in Milano, Merz started drawing during World War II, when he was imprisoned for his activities with the Giustizia e Libert√† antifascist group. He experimented with a continuous graphic stroke‚Äìnot removing his pencil point from the paper. He explored the relationship between nature and the subject, until he had his first exhibitions in the intellectually incendiary context of Turin in the 1950s, a cultural climate fed by such writers as Cesare Pavese, Elio Vittorini, and Ezra Pound. He met Marisa Merz during his studies in Turin in the 1950s. They were associated with the development of Arte Povera, and they were both influenced by each other's works. He died in Milan in 2003. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1447610/Mario-Merz.html Work Merz discarded abstract expressionism's subjectivity in favor of opening art to exterior space: a seed or a leaf in the wind becomes a universe on his canvas. From the mid-1960s, his paintings echoed his desire to explore the transmission of energy from the organic to the inorganic, a curiosity that led him to create works in which neon lights pierced everyday objects, such as an umbrella, a glass, a bottle or his own raincoat. Without ever using ready-made objects as \\"things\\" (at least to the extent that the Nouveau Realistes in France did), Merz and his companions drew the guiding lines of a renewed life for Italian art in the global context. Fibonacci numbers by Mario Merz at the Centre for International Light Art in Unna, Germany. Many of his installations were accented with words or numbers in neon. The numbers counted off the Fibonacci progression, the mathematical formula (named for the Italian monk and mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci who discovered it) for growth patterns found in many forms of life, including leaves, snail shells, pine cones and reptile skins.Roberta Smith (November 13, 2003), Mario Merz, 78, an Italian Installation Artist New York Times. The pattern is identifiable as a sequence of numbers in which any given number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc., ad infinitum.Mario Merz, September 18, 2008 - January 6, 2009 Gladstone Gallery, New York. From 1969 Merz employed the Fibonacci sequence in performances and installations throughout his career to represent the universal principles of creation and growth: climbing up the Guggenheim Museum in New York (1971) or the spire of a Turin landmark (1984), or perched in neon on a stack of newspapers among the old masters of Naples' Capodimonte Gallery (1987).Christopher Masters (November 13, 2003), Obituary: Mario Merz The Guardian. In 1972 he illustrated the Fibonacci progression with a series of photographs of a factory workers' lunchroom and a restaurant progressively crowded with diners. His 1973 show at the John Weber Gallery in New York expressed the Fibonacci in a series of low modular tables.Roberta Smith (November 13, 2003), Mario Merz, 78, an Italian Installation Artist New York Times. In 1990 the sequence determined the form of a spiral assembled from sticks, iron and paper across 24 meters of a hall in Prato, near Florence. An installation of Fibonacci numbers by Merz is the landmark of the Centre for International Light Art in Unna, Germany. Merz became fascinated by architecture: he admired the skyscraper-builders of New York City; his father was an architect; and his art thereby conveys a sensitivity for the unity of space and the human residing therein. He made big spaces feel human, intimate and natural. He was intrigued by the powerful (Wagner, D‚Äôannunzio) as well as the small (a seed that will generate a tree or the shape of a leaf) and applied both to his drawing. In the 1960s, Merz's work with energy, light and matter placed him in the movement that Germano Celant named Arte Povera, which, together with Futurism, was one of the most influential movements of Italian art in the 20th century. In 1968 Merz began to work on his famous igloos and continued throughout his life, revealing the prehistoric and tribal features hidden within the present time and space. He saw the mobility of this typical shelter for nomadic wandering as an ideal metaphor for the space of the artist.Mario Merz, September 18, 2008 - January 6, 2009 Gladstone Gallery, New York. The neon words on his igloos are hallmark Italian phraseology: like \\"rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll,\\" they have the power of being the more than catch phrases or slogans, but the voice of his time in history. His first of the dome-shaped structures, \\"Giap's Igloo,\\" in 1968 was decorated with a saying by General Vo Nguyen Giap of North Vietnam: If the enemy masses his forces, he loses ground. If he scatters, he loses force. By the time of his first solo museum exhibition in the United States, at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, in 1972, Merz had also added stacked newspapers, archetypal animals, and motorcycles to his iconography, to be joined later by the table, symbolizing a locus of the human need for fulfillment and interaction.Biography: Mario Merz Guggenheim Collection. From the late 1970s to the end of his career, Merz joined many artists of his generation in returning periodically to more conventional media. In Le Foglie (The Leaves) (1983‚Äì84), measuring over 26 feet across, gold leaf squares are scattered around two large asymmetrical leaf-like forms.Mario Merz: Major Works from the 1980s, 1 November - 22 December 2012 Sperone Westwater, New York. He even, occasionally, carved in marble, with which in 2002 he made five statues displayed from the windows of a building at the International Sculpture Biennale in Carrara. Merz said: \\"Space is curved, the earth is curved, everything on earth is curved\\" and subsequently produced large curvilinear installations like the one at the Guggenheim in New York. This retrospective was the artist's first major museum show in the United States. These last works are formally transcendent and unusually light. His site-specific works in archaeological sites redeem spaces from touristy tedium with a single neon line, which serves as source of aesthetic inspiration. He had the wild, immediate perceptiveness of a child. His works encapsulate this nature together with an uncanny universality and versatility. In 1996, Merz collaborated with Jil Sander on a fashion show, including a wind tunnel of sheer white fabric twisted and filled with blowing leaves.Amy Spindler (October 8, 1996), When Designers Take Cues From Art New York Times. Along with six other collaborations between artists and fashion designers on the occasion of the first Biennale of Florence that same year, Merz and Sander were assigned an individual pavilion designed by architect Arata Isozaki. Merz and Sander transformed their pavilion, which was open to the outside, into a wind tunnel inspired by the form of a 10-foot diameter cylinder. One end of the tunnel was fitted with an oculus through which the viewer could gaze into a vortex of blowing leaves and flowers through the length of a suspended fabric cone.Heinz Peter Schwerfel (December 1996), Die Mode geht, aber die Kunst bleibt art ‚Äì Das Kunstmagazin. Exhibitions Merz had his first one- man exhibition, in 1954, at the Galleria La Bussola in Turin;Christopher Masters (November 13, 2003), Obituary: Mario Merz The Guardian. his first solo European museum exhibition took place at the Kunsthalle Basel in 1975. He has since been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions at institutions around the world, including Funda√ß√£o de Serralves, Porto; Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London (1975); Moderna Museet, Stockholm (1983); Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg; Fundaci√≥n Antoni T√†pies, Barcelona; Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1989); a two-venue retrospective at Castello di Rivoli and Galleria d‚ÄôArte Moderna, Turin (2005). In the years 1972, 1977, 1983 and 1992 Mario Merz participated in the documenta 5, 6, 7 and 9. In 1989, his work \\"Se la forma scompare la sua radice √® eterna\\" was installed at the Deichtorhallen. Recognition Merz was awarded the Ambrogino Gold Prize, Milan; the Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Vienna; the Arnold Bode Prize, Kassel; and the Praemium Imperiale for sculpture (2003). He was the subject of an atmospheric film, Mario Merz (2002), shot during the summer of 2002 in San Gimignano by the British artist Tacita Dean. The Fondazione Merz in Turin, Italy, regularly displays both the works of its namesake and sponsors exhibitions by living artists.

He was a member of the Academies of Science of USSR and Armenian SSR (the latter was founded by his brother Joseph Orbeli). Leon Orbeli became director of the Institute of Physiology in 1950. Orbeli played an important part in the development of evolutionary physiology and wrote more than 200 works on experimental and theoretical science, 130 of them journal articles. Career Levon (or Leon) Orbeli was born in Tsaghkadzor, Armenia (then Darachichag, Erivan Governorate, Russian Empire). He graduated from the Gymnasium in Tbilisi in 1899 and entered the Imperial Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. While still a student in the second course he began to work in the laboratory of Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849‚Äì1936). For the next thirty-five years, Orbeli's life and scientific career were closely connected with the work of Pavlov. Orbeli graduated from the Military Medical Academy in 1904 and became an intern at the Nikolai Hospital in Kronstadt, the Naval Hospital in St. Petersburg. This gave him the opportunity to continue his experimental research in Pavlov's laboratory. Orbeli's scientific career was spent in the leading Russian physiological centres, and he joined Pavlov in 1907, at the very height of Pavlov's research on conditioned reflexes. He was Pavlov's assistant in the Department of Physiology at the Institute for Experimental Medicine from 1907 to 1920. From 1918-1946 he was head of the Department for Physiology of the State Institute for Science Research P. F. Lesgaft, located at the Petrograd Scientific Institute in the Biological Station in Koltushi. Orbeli was professor of physiology at the First Leningrad Medical Institute from 1920 to 1931, and from 1925 to 1950 professor of physiology at the Military-Medical Academy. He was head of the latter from 1943 to 1950. Orbeli worked for two years abroad, with Karl Ewald Konstantin Hering (1834‚Äì1918) in Germany, John Newport Langley (1852‚Äì1925) and Joseph Barcroft (1872‚Äì1947) in England, and at the Marine Biological Station in Naples. After Pavlov's death in 1936, Orbeli, now Russia's most prominent scientist, was appointed director of the Pavlov Institute. From 1939 to 1946 he was secretary to the Department of Biological Science and vice president of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1956 Orbeli organized the I. M. Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and headed this institution until 1958. It was later renamed I. M. Sechenov Intstitute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. In 1935 he was elected an active member of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. In 1945 he was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. He held the rank of Colonel General.

When a problem is reported by a subscriber dialing the designated number (often (1)+611), it is filed and relayed through the Cross Front End, which is a link from the CRSAB to the LMOS network. The trouble report is then sent to the Front End via the Datakit network, where a Basic Output Report is requested (usually by a lineman). The BOR provides line information including past trouble history and MLT (Mechanized Loop Testing) tests. As LMOS is responsible for trouble reports, analysis, and similar related functions, MLT does the actual testing of customer loops. MLT hardware is located in the Repair Service Bureau. Test trunks connect MLT hardware to the telephone exchanges or wire centers, which in turn connect with the subscriber loops. The LMOS database is a proprietary file system, designed with 11 access methods (variable index, index, hash tree, fixed partition file, etc.). This is highly tuned for the various pieces of data used by LMOS. LMOS, which was first brought on line as a mainframe application in the 1970s, was one of the first telephone company operations support systems to be ported to the UNIX operating system. The first port of LMOS was to Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP 11/70 machines and was completed in 1981. Later versions used VAX-11/780s. Today, LMOS runs on HP-UX 11i systems.

On September 5, an abrupt shift in steering currents caused the system to turn north- northwestward. Early on September 6, the system intensified into a typhoon. Over the following two days, Babe quickly intensified, ultimately attaining its peak intensity early on September 8 with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) and a barometric pressure of 905 mbar (hPa; 26.72 inHg). Not long after reaching this strength, another shift in the steering patterns caused the typhoon to execute a prolonged counter-clockwise arc, causing it to track through the Ryukyu Islands southwest of Japan, as it interacted with a low pressure originating from the Korean Peninsula. During this time, the system gradually weakened and eventually it made landfall near Shanghai, China on September 11 as a minimal typhoon before dissipating inland the following day. Coincidentally, Typhoon Babe and Atlantic Hurricane Babe existed at the same time from September 3‚Äì9. Passing through the Ryukyu Islands as a powerful typhoon, Babe caused considerable damage in the region. More than 1,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 7,000 more were damaged or flooded. One person was killed on Amami ≈åshima and 77 others were injured throughout the country. Total losses reached ¬•6.1 billion (US$23 million). Offshore, over 100 vessels were affected by the storm, including a Panamanian freighter where 13 people lost their lives. In China, more than 24,000 homes were destroyed and nine people were killed. Meteorological history In late August 1977, an area of disturbed weather was noted south of Pohnpei. By September 1, a weak surface low accompanied by organized convection developed within the disturbance. Situated to the south of a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough, conditions were favorable for further organization and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Tracking steadily west-northwestward in response to a well-developed subtropical ridge extending from the International Dateline to China, the system was soon classified a tropical depression early on September 2. Hours later, a weather reconnaissance mission into the depression revealed winds of 75 km/h (45 mph), prompting the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Babe. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Miling. Initially, forecasters anticipated Babe to maintain its westward course as it strengthened and threaten the Philippines; however, its forward motion gradually slowed as it neared the region. On September 5, an upper-level trough formed over northeastern Asia and created a weakness in the subtropical ridge, allowing Babe to turn north-northwestward. Over the following two days, the storm quickly strengthened as divergence increased ahead of the storm, with Babe attaining typhoon status early on September 6 Between 0832 UTC on September 5 and 2204 UTC on September 7, the storm's barometric pressure dropped from 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18 inHg) to 907 mbar (hPa; 26.79 inHg), approximately 1.3 mbar (hPa; 0.04 inHg) per hour. Early on September 8, Babe attained its peak intensity with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) while situated approximately 465 km (290 mi) southeast of Ishigaki Island. This ranked it as the first and only super typhoon of the 1977 season. At this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated the storm to have had peak ten-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and a minimum pressure of 905 mbar (hPa; 26.72 inHg). Until September 8, Babe was forecast to continue northwestward into Taiwan and later China; however, another upper-level trough moved into northeastern China and further weakened the ridge. This in turn allowed a new area of low pressure to develop over the Korean Peninsula and cause Babe to curve northeastward. While moving northeastward, Babe gradually weakened and began to undergo a Fujiwhara-like interaction with the low near Korea as that system moved southwestward. Accelerating along a counter-clockwise arc, Babe moved through the Ryukyu Islands as a weakening typhoon on September 9 before taking a steady westward course into China. As the system passed through the archipelago, a pressure of 907.3 mbar (hPa; 26.80 inHg) was measured on Okinoerabujima. Babe eventually made landfall near Shanghai with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) before rapidly weakening over land. The system was last noted early on September 12 over Anhui Province. Impact Torrential rain fell across much of the Ryukyu Islands, Shikoku, and Kyushu. The highest total were observed in K≈çchi Prefecture, with Funato in Tsuno, K≈çchi measuring . The small island of Okinoerabujima reportedly experienced winds in excess of for two hours as the typhoon passed by. Nearly two-thirds of the homes across the island were damaged or destroyed by the storm and 73 people were injured. Most of the injuries across the island were caused by collapsing buildings. One person was killed on Amami ≈åshima and 77 others were injured across the Amami Islands. According to Japanese police, 1,146 homes were destroyed, mainly by flooding and landslides, while 1,097 more were damaged and another 5,826 were flooded. At least 14,927 people were left homeless. Losses across the country amounted to ¬•6.1 billion (US$23 million). About north-northwest of Okinawa, the Panamanian freighter May Cruiser became stranded and in danger of sinking on September 10 with its crew of 25. The Japanese Maritime Safety Agency deployed five airplanes and four patrol boats to search for survivors. Additionally, ten Japanese fishing boats in the area assisted in search and rescue. By September 12, rescuers found nine sailors and thirteen bodies, while three others remained missing. Elsewhere in the East China Sea, approximately 100 Japanese fishing vessels attempting to seek shelter from the storm were damaged. In China, wind gusts reportedly reached , resulting in extensive damage. Around 24,000 homes were destroyed and nine people were killed.

It runs east from the state capital Melbourne through the cities of Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Sale and terminating at Bairnsdale. Prior to its dismantlement in 1994, the line extended to Orbost. The dismantled section now comprises the East Gippsland Rail Trail, a shared bicycle, walking, and horseriding track. Services Metro Trains Melbourne operates suburban passenger services along the inner section of the line as the Pakenham line, while V/Line services operate as the Traralgon and the Bairnsdale lines. Freight services also use the line, operated by Qube Holdings. History Double headed coal train passing westbound through Warragul station ~1920 Coal train passing through Moe Station, ~1920 Traralgon railway station ~1920 The current end of the line at Bairnsdale Section of line at Morwell Loop upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project Rail lines were built to Gippsland in the 1870s and initially played a crucial role in developing agricultural industries in Gippsland as well as tourism. It also played a crucial role in the development of coal mining in the Latrobe Valley in the 1920s. At its peak, the railway travelled as far east as Orbost, and there are still frequent services to many of the towns. Some of the disused rail lines have been turned into tourist railways and/or rail trails. The Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company opened a line from Princes Bridge railway station to Punt Road (Richmond) and South Yarra in 1859, Prahran in 1859 and Windsor in 1860, connecting with the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company line. This line was extended to Dandenong, Pakenham, Warragul, Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Sale, Stratford and Bairnsdale between 1877 and 1879. It was extended to Orbost in 1916. The railway to Orbost opened in 1916 and operated until 1987, principally carrying timber and farming produce. In the early days of the railway's operation, dedicated passenger trains ran, but these ceased by the 1930s. The track infrastructure was dismantled in 1994. The line traversed a mixture of farmland, hills and heavily forested country. It included numerous bridges, including the Stoney Creek Trestle Bridge, the largest of its kind in Victoria. In 1954, the line beyond Dandenong was electrified, mainly because of the expected briquette traffic from the brown coal mines in the Latrobe Valley, and over the next two years most of the line between Dandenong and Pakenham was duplicated and provided with power signalling, although Narre Warren to Berwick was not done until 1962. In due course, the rail transport of briquettes petered out as industry converted to natural gas and homes were converted to other forms of heating. Electrification was cut back to Warragul in 1987, with suburban-style trains providing the services from there to Melbourne. Electrification was further cut back to Bunyip in 1998, before ceasing entirely beyond Pakenham in 2001. The line east of Sale was closed in 1994, but was reopened to Bairnsdale in 2004. In 2005, the Regional Fast Rail project upgraded one of the two lines between Pakenham and Traralgon. This project also included removing the remaining electrification infrastructure from Pakenham East to Traralgon, with the exception of a heritage-listed length in Bunyip.  Branch lines  The private SECV Morwell Interconnecting Railway bridge crossing the main Gippsland railway and the Princes Drive Exit on the west edge of Morwell A branch line was built north from Warragul in stages from the 1890s, reaching Noojee in 1919. This was closed in stages from 1954 to 1958. The narrow gauge Walhalla branch line was completed across mountainous country from Moe to Erica and Walhalla in 1910. The Platina to Walhalla section closed in 1944, Erica to Platina in 1952, and finally Moe to Erica in 1954. The northernmost section between Thomson and Walhalla stations has been reopened as a tourist railway by the Walhalla Goldfields Railway, and provides regularly scheduled trains. A branch line was also opened from Moe to Thorpdale in 1888, which was closed in 1958. The Yallourn branch was opened from Hernes Oak (between Moe and Morwell) to Yallourn in 1922 to serve the adjacent power station development. It was replaced by a line from Moe to Yallourn in 1953 because its route was required for brown coal mining, but the new line closed in 1987, having been disused since the late 1970s. The Mirboo North branch line was opened in stages from Morwell to Mirboo North between 1885 and 1886; however, it was closed in 1974. The route of the line was partly dug up as part of the Hazelwood open cut mine. The Maryvale paper siding also connects to the main line at Morwell and remains open today for regular freight traffic. The loop line via Maffra was opened from Traralgon to Heyfield, Maffra and Stratford in 1887 and closed in stages between 1987 and 1993. A branch line was opened from Maffra to Briagolong in 1889 and closed in 1952. Several timber tramways also existed from many of the stations between Pakenham and Yarragon.  Significance  The expansion of the railway in the late 1870s helped to develop Gippsland. It enabled milk from western Gippsland to be sold fresh into Melbourne while the dairy industry of East Gippsland provided cheese and butter. It also enabled development of west Gippsland's market gardening and orcharding industry for sale in Melbourne markets. It also encouraged the development of a tourism industry notably at Lakes Entrance. It did, however, end coastal shipping traffic and the use of Sale and Bairnsdale as ports. In the 1920s, the Gippsland railway played an important role in developing the mining of lignite coal and the development of the Latrobe Valley for power generation primarily serving Melbourne and Victoria. This saw the development of industry in towns such as Yallourn, Morwell, Traralgon, Moe, Warragul and Drouin. The development of the Gippsland Railway helped fuel the Melbourne land boom in the 1870s. The original departure point for the railway was Oakleigh with the line connecting Oakleigh and Melbourne not built until 1879. The Victorian Railways bought land in Oakleigh for use as workshops. Oakleigh became a centre of what was known as \\"railway fever\\" as developers developed and marketed houses close to rail lines between Oakleigh and other suburbs for use of workers travelling to and from their job. At the height of the land boom in 1888, land sales were being held two or three times a week in the district. The collapse of the land boom in 1889 eventually contributed to banking collapses in 1893, and the major depression of the 1890s. The Gippsland railway remains a significant passenger corridor on the V/Line network, although its use for freight business has now declined to only one major customer, being Australian Paper's export traffic from its mill in Maryvale.  Tourist railways and rail trails  Walhalla Goldfields Railway Many of the lines in Gippsland have closed because they had become uneconomic. Some of these have been turned into tourist railways including: * the Walhalla Goldfields Railway between Moe and Walhalla; Other stretches of line have become rail trails for use by bicyclists. These include: * the Noojee Trestle Bridge Trail in the upper reaches of the Latrobe River; * a section between Erica and the Thomson River on the former Walhalla line (pending eventual reconstruction of the Walhalla Goldfields Railway's tourist line between Thomson and Erica stations).; * Collins Siding to Tyers Valley Rail Trail near Moe; * Moe to Yallourn Rail Trail; * Mirboo North to Boolarra Rail Trail; * Great Southern Rail Trail from Leongatha to Foster; * Bass Coast Rail Trail Anderson to Wonthaggi; * East Gippsland Rail Trail from Bairnsdale to Nowa Nowa and Orbost; and the * Gippsland Plains Rail Trail from Stratford to Maffra.

The Mosquitos represent the best PNG born and bred male players from the clubs and teams of AFL PNG and is one of the nation's most successful sporting teams, currently ranked 2nd in the world behind Australia. Beginning as a state representative team in 1973 (when it participated in the Teal Cup), it debuted internationally against Australia at Under 17 level in 1977. Papua New Guinea is the most decorated nation in international Australian Football, having won the equal most Australian Football International Cup titles (3 - 2008, 2014, 2017) and five medals including 3 silver medals (2002, 2005, 2011), as well as three gold medals at the Arafura Games. Identity The team's nickname is the Mosquitos or \\"Mozzies\\" (aka Binatangs ‚Äì local PNG name for small insects, similar to a mosquito). The Mosquito's guernsey has the kumul (raggiana bird-of-paradise), a national symbol of PNG (and element of the national flag of Papua New Guinea), in the national colours of red, black and yellow. History In the early 1970s, Australian clubs began touring PNG to compete against selections of local players but it wasn't until 1973 that the national team first began to form. 1977 was a historic year for Papua New Guinean footy. The year saw the first ever international matches involving Australia at under 17 level between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The Australian Under 17 squad toured Papua New Guinea, and the PNG team reciprocated in Adelaide, with Australia dominating the game and taking the honours. The subsequent decline in the sport in PNG and growth of the sport in Australia did not see the Mosquitos compete again until 1995, when Aussie Rules was first played at the Arafura Games in Darwin, Northern Territory. That year PNG won the gold medal of the International division defeating New Zealand. In the same competition, PNG also competed against sides from Nauru, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. In 1996 the Mosquitoes played a curtain raiser to an Australian Football League match in Perth overwhelmingly defeating the Central Desert Eagles. In 1997, PNG successfully defended their Arafura Games title again defeating New Zealand. In 1999 won the gold medal again at the games, once again defeating New Zealand in the final. In 2000, the Mosquitoes were invited to play New Zealand in a curtain raiser to a pre-season AFL match in Wellington, but were unable to raise the funds required. In 2002, Papua New Guinea competed in the International Cup in Melbourne. PNG went through the competition undefeated only to lose to Ireland in the Grand Final. A minor setback to the representation of the Mosquitos was the cancellation of the 2003 Arafura Games due to SARS fears. Prior to the 2005 International Cup, AFL legend Mal Michael offered to play for the PNG side, but was ruled ineligible by the AFL. Although he was born in PNG, he did not satisfy the criteria since he had moved to Australia at too young an age. Despite Michael not being involved in the side, he tipped PNG to win the competition, hailing the strong growth in the local competitions. In the 2005 International Cup, PNG again went through the competition unbeaten only to lose the Grand Final to a much improved New Zealand national team. Papua New Guinea's best and fairest player (from the 2005 International Cup) is Navu Maha. Navu also won the award for the best player in the 2005 International Cup series and captained both the 2002 and 2005 teams. In early 2008, the national team secured its first major sponsor ‚Äì Telikom PNG ‚Äì which helped to fund the junior squads competing in Australia and the senior squad's International Cup campaign. In the 2008 International Cup, PNG, captained by Alister Sioni again went through the competition unbeaten, this time defeating New Zealand in a thriller. 2 points up at the final siren, 17-year-old Amua Pirika kicked a goal after the siren.

This is an advantage compared to the three different missiles required in the 9M120 Ataka-V complex. The use of the proximity fuze allows a near miss of up to 5 m and makes it possible to engage an air target at speeds of 500 m/s. The Vikhr missile laser beam control system provides for its precise guidance owing to data transmission to the missile in the course of its launch, which is excluded in homing systems. The laser guidance principle is identical to that used by 9M117 Bastion or 9M119 Svir antiarmor missiles. The Vikhr missile control system has high jamming immunity because its receiver faces the carrier, thereby protecting it from jamming signals. The high pinpoint target hit probability (reported 0.95 against stationary targets) is provided by the automatic target tracking system and highly accurate missile control system that makes allowance for changes in the parameters of the carrier and the target in the course of firing. The missiles can be fired singly or in pairs (at the same target to increase lethality). The high flight speed allows it to engage targets rapidly. The system is capable of launching Vikhr missiles against two to four targets during a 30-second period and starting at a range of 10 km, which increases its lethality to three to four times that of earlier systems.

Covering several decades from the 1960s to the late 1990s, it is about a man who marries three women and in turn ruins each of their lives. Accordingly, the book is about three rather than just one \\"Mrs. Kimble.\\" Mrs. Kimble won the PEN/Hemingway Award 2003 for outstanding first fiction. Plot summary Born in 1929, Ken Kimble is raised the son of a pastor in Missouri and becomes a minister like his father. While working as a chaplain in a Bible college in Richmond, Virginia he feels attracted to Birdie Bell, one of his female students. Ken, who is 32, marries the 19-year-old Birdie on the spot. The Kimbles have two children, Charlie and Jody. Soon after he is forced to resign over an alleged affair, Ken disappears with Moira Snell, one of his students. It takes Birdie many years to get over her husband's desertion. Only at the end of the novel, when she is 51, does Birdie find some solace with Curtis Mabry, her teenage sweetheart. In 1969, at the age of 40, Ken moves to Florida with Moira, where he finds work as a gardener. When he and Moira break up after a few months, he takes a room with Joan Cohen, a rich professional woman of Jewish descent about his own age. They soon become lovers and Joan sees Ken as her last chance at happiness, especially now that one of her breasts has been removed due to breast cancer. Ken pretends to have a Jewish background and, after getting married under Jewish law, starts working as a real estate broker. Joan realizes that she knows nothing about her husband's past when she finds an old photograph of his two children. Unable to have children of her own, Joan persuades Ken to fetch his children so that they can be raised in Florida. Ken tricks Birdie by offering to take the kids on vacation, which she naively accepts. At first, Charlie and Jody take Joan for a nanny. When he realizes the truth, Charlie steals some money from Joan and escapes with his little sister. Joan soon after dies of breast cancer. Ken inherits all her money and moves to Washington, D.C. to set up a new real estate business. In the late 1970s, he has a chance meeting with Dinah, who used to babysit Charlie and Jody. Although she is more than 25 years his junior, they get married in 1979 and have one son, Brendan. Ken one day sells his company and starts a government-funded project providing affordable accommodation for those in need, which gains him a lot of recognition in the community. Dinah has an extramarital affair until Ken, despite his lifelong strict diet and his regular exercise, has a heart attack in 1994 at the age of 65. Hoping that it might cheer Ken up, Dinah invites Charlie and Jody for Thanksgiving, but the family reunion only serves as an eye-opener to Ken Kimble's despicable character. After recovering from his illness, Ken leaves Dinah. It is soon discovered that he had been embezzling large sums of money from his non-profit organisation and that a small child has died in one of the houses he is responsible for because he refused to have a faulty furnace repaired. Ken dies alone in Florida.

Greene (also known as Mrs. Graham), who then died of septic peritonitis.

Early life He was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, on October 9, 1909, and was the son of the Anglican bishop of the diocese of Keewatin. His family moved to Kenora, Ontario, in 1924 and he received his secondary education there. He attended the University of Toronto where he received a general Bachelor of Arts in Astronomy and English. In the summer of 1928, he accompanied his father on a 3,800 mile journey to visit the Ojibway and Cree missions in Northern Ontario. Much of this venture was travelled by canoe. This experience established his interest in native culture and love of the bush in the Canadian Shield. In 1932, he attended the Ontario College of Education and received a High School Assistant's Certificate and Art Specialists Certificate. He also took a course in landscape painting. Later life In 1933, he was hired by the Geological Survey of Canada, and was assigned to survey the transition zone between the Precambrian formations of the Canadian Shield and the Hudson Bay lowlands. Among the muskeg and blackflies, he sketched the landscape and produced pencil portraits of the traverse crew at the survey camp. His inspiration as an artist came from the great northern landscapes that he loved to visit. His dramatic style is quite similar to that of the Group of Seven. In 1934, he attended the Ontario College of Art, graduating with honors, and moved to London, Ontario. Family In 1936, he married Irene Donner in a ceremony conducted by his father. Their honeymoon was a 500-mile canoe trip loop from Kenora to Red Lake. Their children were:Selwyn Dewdney Fonds, UWO * Donner Dewdney, a child psychiatrist, known for discovering the facial distortion effect among schizophrenic children * Alexander Dewdney, a mathematician, author, conservationist, environmental scientist and naturalist * Peter Dewdney, a photographer and gold prospector * Christopher Dewdney, an award-winning poet and non-fiction author; and Teaching In 1936, he began teaching at Sir Adam Beck Secondary School, London, Ontario, but resigned in protest at the demotion of a colleague in 1945. This experience was the subject of his first novel, Wind Without Rain. Art therapy With a growing family of three sons, he turned to illustrating books, writing, researching, editing and painting commissioned murals to support them. It was during this time that he became interested in art therapy when he was commissioned to illustrate Lionel Penrose's psychiatric 'M' test. In 1947, while working at Westminster Veterans Hospital in London, he began giving art instruction to some to the psychiatric patients. The positive results of this eventually afforded him the position of Psychiatric Art Therapist. He and his wife Irene were pioneers in the field of Canadian art therapy. His work, and particularly his wife's, led to the development of an art therapy training program at the University of Western Ontario in 1986. Rock art During the 1950s, his ongoing exploration of Northern Ontario introduced him to the ancient native pictographs painted in red ochre on the rocks. A chance meeting with Kenneth E. Kidd, curator of the ethnology department of the Royal Ontario Museum, led to an opportunity to join Kidd and help record the pictograph sites. By 1957, eleven rock-painting sites were recorded in Quetico Provincial Park. Between 1959 and 1965, with two of his sons as field assistants, he discovered and recorded rock art from the foothills of the Rockies to the Atlantic coast. By 1978, he had visited 301 sites in Canada and the U.S. In 1962, the first edition of Indian Rock Paintings of the Great Lakes was published, with Kenneth Kidd as co- author.Indian Rock Paintings of the Great Lakes, Internet Archive The Sacred Scrolls Dewdney learned of a secret society within the Ojibway, the Midewiwin, which purportedly embodied traditional ceremonial rituals of healing and sorcery and included four degrees of initiation. It is believed that some essential elements of the Midewiwin, which was first documented by Europeans in the early 18th century, were \\"elaborations of traditional Anishinaabe beliefs and practices\\".Angel, Michael, Preserving the Sacred: Historical Perspectives on the Ojibwa Midewiwin (University of Manitoba Press, 2002, ), p. 74,Meghan C. L. Howey and John M. O'Shea. \\"Bear's Journey and the Study of Ritual in Archaeology\\". American Antiquity, Vol. 71, No. 2 (April 2006), Society for American Archaeology, pp. 261-282. Elements of this belief system were recorded on scrolls made of birch bark, sewn together with cedar roots. His The Sacred Scrolls of the Southern Ojibway (1975), remains the only volume dedicated exclusively to this subject. Norval Morrisseau In 1960, Dewdney met Norval Morrisseau, a young native artist, and his encouragement and support helped promote Morrisseau as the country's best known Woodland artist. Dewdney edited Morrisseau's book Legends of My People. Dewdney wrote article about him in 1963 and 1965. At one time, Morrisseau and his family lived with Dewdney and his family at their home on Erie Avenue in London.Selwyn Dewdney, Norval Morrisseau & the Ojibwe Pictograph Tradition, rambin' boy Last years In 1978, he published his second novel, Christopher Breton. He died on November 18, 1979, following heart surgery. In 1980, two stands of white pine were planted at Agawa Bay in Lake Superior Provincial Park by the Ministry of Natural Resources to honor his memory. A plaque erected by the family stands against the Shield rock he loved so much, a few meters away from the Ojibway pictograph Mishibizhiw, the great horned lynx. In 1997, Selwyn's son, Alexander K. Dewdney, published Daylight in the Swamp, based on his father's bush diary, field notes and letters. Selwyn had been working on the original manuscript for the book at the time of his death.Daylight in the Swamp, Dunburn Books See also * Walam Olum * Birch bark document * Midewiwin * Wiigwaasabak * Petroglyphs * Pictographs Selected bibliography * 1946: Wind Without Rain.

Extensive quote from July, 1903 Automobile Topics magazine, titled '1903 Cross Country by Dr Jackson in his Winton Automobile' Crocker was born in Walla Walla, Washington on April 7, 1883. In addition to giving Jackson driving lessons, he also may have convinced Jackson to use a Winton vehicle for the trip. Jackson purchased a two-cylinder, 20-horsepower Winton motor car that he dubbed the Vermont for the journey, which was conceived following a $50 wager to prove that a four- wheeled machine could be driven across the country. The drive from coast to coast was financed by Jackson, using about $8,000 of his wife's money after his own went missing on the road. Crocker and Jackson departed San Francisco, California on May 23, 1903, and drove to New York City in about 63 days, arriving on July 26. They never collected the $50 wager. Crocker was primarily responsible for making the necessary repairs of the vehicle during the trip, which broke down frequently, especially on the harsh, unpaved roads of the West. The two men quickly became national celebrities. After the race, Crocker attempted to capitalize on his fame by seeking sponsors for a round-the-world auto tour, but it never materialized.

These towers are a part of the King Abdulaziz Endowment Project that aims to modernize the city in catering to its pilgrims. The central hotel tower, the Makkah Royal Clock Tower, has the world's largest clock face and is the third-tallest building and fifth- tallest freestanding structure in the world. The clock tower contains the Clock Tower Museum that occupies the top four floors of the tower. The building complex is metres away from the world's largest mosque and Islam's most sacred site, the Great Mosque of Mecca. The developer and contractor of the complex is the Saudi Binladin Group, the Kingdom's largest construction company. It is the world's second most expensive building with the total cost of construction totalling US$15 billion. The complex was built after the demolition of the Ajyad Fortress, the 18th-century Ottoman citadel on top of a hill overlooking the Grand Mosque. The destruction of the historically significant site in 2002 by the Saudi government sparked international outcry and a strong response from Turkey. Description The tallest tower in the complex is the tallest building in Saudi Arabia, with a height of . Currently it is the fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the world, surpassing the Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, China but shorter than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE, the Tokyo Skytree in Tokyo, Japan, the Shanghai Tower in Shanghai, China, and the Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China. The site of the complex is located across the piazza to the south from the main entrance (King Abdul-Aziz Gate) to the Masjid al Haram mosque, which houses the Kaaba. To accommodate worshippers visiting the Kaaba, the Abraj Al-Bait Towers has two large prayer rooms (one for men, one for women) capable of holding more than 10,000 people. The tallest tower in the complex also contains a five-star hotel, operated by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, to help provide lodging for the millions of pilgrims that travel to Mecca annually to participate in the Hajj.

Incidents =Construction fires= The Abraj-Al-Bait complex had two fire incidents during construction. The first fire accident was at Hajar Tower on 28 October 2008. It took 400 firefighters to put out the fire, which burned for 10 hours, consuming nine floors of the tower.Ibtisam Sheqdar: \\"Fire damages Makkah tower\\" Arab News, 1 May 2009 According to eyewitness reports, the blaze erupted shortly after midnight, and spread rapidly because of wood used for construction stored in the premises. Soon, the entire building was engulfed in smoke. Hospitals were put on high alert, but no injuries were reported. A civil defence spokesman said the fire started on the 32nd floor of the Hajar Tower.Mariam Al Hakeem: \\"Makkah hotel fire under investigation\\" Gulf News, 21 October 2008 The second fire struck the Safa Tower on 1 May 2009. No deaths or injuries were reported in the blaze which was quickly contained by Civil Defence. Eyewitnesses said the fire broke out soon after Asr prayer while some workers in the building were welding iron rods on wooden scaffoldings. The fire damaged a large part of the under-construction tower. According to Major General Adel Zamzami, director general of Civil Defence in the Mecca province, the fire broke out at the 14th floor and reached up to the 20th floor. =Controversy= The construction engendered some controversy as the location chosen for the towers was the historic 18th-century Ottoman Ajyad Fortress, which was demolished to make way for them.‚ÄòShame of the House of Saud: Shadows over Mecca‚Äô, The Independent, 19 April 2006 The development has been criticised by The Guardian for having \\"transformed a type of architecture that evolved from a dense urban grain of low-rise courtyards and narrow streets into ... an endlessly repeatable pattern for the decoration of standardised [concrete] slab(s)\\".Mecca's mega architecture casts shadow over hajj.

A shielding gas is sometimes used, but pressure is not applied. A major difference between EGW and its cousin electroslag welding is that the arc in EGW is not extinguished, instead remains struck throughout the welding process. It is used to make square-groove welds for butt and t-joints, especially in the shipbuilding industry and in the construction of storage tanks. Operation In EGW, the heat of the welding arc causes the electrode and workpieces to melt and flow into the cavity between the parts being welded. This molten metal solidifies from the bottom up, joining the parts being welded together. The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by a separate shielding gas, or by the gas produced by the disintegration of a flux-cored electrode wire. The electrode is guided into the weld area by either a consumable electrode guide tube, like the one used in electroslag welding, or a moving head. When the consumable guide tube is used, the weld pool is composed of molten metal coming from the parts being welded, the electrode, and the guide tube. The moving head variation uses an assembly of an electrode guide tube which travels upwards as the weld is laid, keeping it from melting. Electrogas welding can be applied to most steels, including low and medium carbon steels, low alloy high strength steels, and some stainless steels. Quenched and tempered steels may also be welded by the process, provided that the proper amount of heat is applied. Welds must be vertical, varying to either side by a maximum of 15 degrees. In general, the workpiece must be at least 10 mm (0.4 in) thick, while the maximum thickness for one electrode is approximately 20 mm (0.8 in). Additional electrodes make it possible to weld thicker workpieces. The height of the weld is limited only by the mechanism used to lift the welding head‚Äîin general, it ranges from 100 mm (4 in) to 20 m (50 ft). Like other arc welding processes, EGW requires that the operator wear a welding helmet and proper attire to prevent exposure to molten metal and the bright welding arc. Compared to other processes, a large amount of molten metal is present during welding, and this poses an additional safety and fire hazard. Since the process is often performed at great heights, the work and equipment must be properly secured, and the operator should wear a safety harness to prevent injury in the event of a fall. Equipment EGW uses a constant voltage, direct current welding power supply, and the electrode has positive polarity. The welding current can range from 100 to 800 A, and the voltage can range between 30 and 50 V. A wire feeder is used to supply the electrode, which is selected based on the material being welded. The electrode can be flux-cored to provide the weld with protection from atmospheric contamination, or a shielding gas‚Äîgenerally carbon dioxide‚Äîcan be used with a solid wire electrode. The welding head is attached to an apparatus that elevates during the welding process. Also attached to the apparatus are backing shoes which restrain the weld to the width of the workpieces. To prevent them from melting, they are made of copper and are water-cooled. They must be fit tightly against the joint to prevent leaks. References *Cary, Howard B. and Scott C. Helzer (2005).

Situs solitus is the medical term referring to the normal position of thoracic and abdominal organs. Anatomically, this means that the heart is on the left with the pulmonary atrium on the right and the systemic atrium on the left along with the cardiac apex. Right-sided organs are the liver, the gall bladder and a trilobed lung as well as the inferior vena cava, while left- sided organs are the stomach, single spleen, a bilobed lung, and the aorta. Variants on the normal picture are relatively uncommon. Complete reversal of all organs is known as situs inversus, while reversal of some organs but not others is called situs ambiguus or heterotaxy. Isolated reversal of the heart with normally-patterned viscera otherwise is termed dextrocardia. Development Although much of humans' external anatomy is bilaterally symmetric, many internal structures must be signaled to develop asymmetrically in order to form the normal situs solitus orientation. This induced asymmetry is thought to be achieved by a number of morphological factors that guide development. For instance, different levels of NODAL proteins on opposite sides of the embryo have been linked to proper bending of the embryonic heart, giving it its asymmetrical form. As for the question as to how these development-guiding proteins themselves become distributed asymmetrically throughout the embryo, a certain type of embryonic node cell has been identified with cilia known as nodal cilia that move only in a counter- clockwise orientation, thus potentially producing a sort of 'current' in the embryo that would asymmetrically distribute these molecules.

Participants include community members of all ages and status including those who are discriminated against due to language, gender, race, class, disability, etc. Through their art, they bring new insights and perspectives which raise awareness of hidden or overlooked issues and aspects of the community. Participants are asked to express their points of view or represent their communities by photographing scenes that highlight research themes. Common research themes include community concerns, community assets, social issues, and public health barriers.Wang, C. C., Yi, W. K., Tao, Z. W., & Carovano, K. (1998). Photovoice as a participatory health promotion strategy. Health promotion international, 13(1), 75-86. These photographs are collaboratively interpreted through discussions in both small and large groups, and narratives can be developed that explain how the photos highlight a particular research theme. These narratives are then used to promote dialogue to mobilize and help change- makers (i.e. policymakers) better understand and change the community. Thereby developing effective solutions and programs that address the issues and needs.Catalani, C., & Minkler, M. (2010). Photovoice: A review of the literature in health and public health. Health Education & Behavior, 37(3), 424-451. Background Photovoice was developed in 1992 by Caroline C. Wang of the University of Michigan, and Mary Ann Burris, Program Officer for Women's Health at the Ford Foundation headquartered in Beijing, China. The idea was built on the foundation that images and words together can effectively express communities and individual's needs, problems, and desires. In addition, the concept was strongly influenced by documentary photography, the concept empowerment, feminist theory, Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed to promote health education and his idea of critical consciousness.Wallerstein, N., & Bernstein, E. (1988). Empowerment Education: Freire's Ideas Adapted to Health Education. Health Education & Behavior, 15(4), 379-394. Photovoice was first used to empower the silenced rural women in Yunnan Province, China to influence the policies and programs affecting them.Wang, C., & Burris, M. A. (1994). Empowerment through Photo Novella: Portraits of Participation. Health Education & Behavior, 21(2), 171-186. Since then, the method has been used in different settings and populations, such as by refugees in San Diego seeking in‚Äìperson medical interpretation options, by homeless adults in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by Dr. Claudia Mitchell to support community health workers and teachers in rural South Africa, and by Dr. Laura S. Lorenz of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University in her work with brain injury survivors.Lorenz, LS (2010) \\"Brain Injury Survivors: Narratives of Rehabilitation and Healing.\\" Disability in Society, Ronald J. Berger, Series Editor. Boulder, CO and London: Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc. Modern implementation In the 21st century, some university professors have used the photovoice model to teach social work students. In addition, it has been used as a tool to engage children and youth, giving them a safe environment and opportunity to communicate their concerns and coping strategies to policymakers and service providers.Skovdal, M. (2011) ‚ÄúPicturing the coping strategies of caregiving children in Western Kenya: from images to action.‚Äù American Journal of Public Health 101(3): 452-453 In other words, photovoice is used at all levels as a tool for self- development, sharing awareness, advocacy, research, needs assessment, monitoring, etc. So the use of photovoice allows one to capture and widen their perspective on all levels of various issues. Variants Also known as \\"participatory photography\\" or \\"photo novella\\", photovoice is considered a sub‚Äìtype of \\"participatory visual methods\\" or picturevoice which includes techniques such as photo-elicitation and digital storytelling. These techniques allow research participants to create visuals that capture their individual perspectives as part of the research process.\\"Picturevoice: Health Communication Through Art.\\" Presentation.

An example of this is found in Project Lives, a participatory photography project used to create a new image of project housing dwellers, published in April 2015. Two other forms of picturevoice include paintvoice, stemming from the work of Michael Yonas, and comicvoice, which has been pioneered by John Baird's Create a Comic Project since 2008, and to a lesser extent by Michael Bitz's Comic Book Project.\\"Healthy Holidays: Lessons Learned from a Community Education Event.\\" Presentation.

(2010) International development In international research, photovoice has been seen to allow participants from the developing world to define how they want to be represented to the international community. The individuals are facilitated and given control to tell their stories and perspectives which empower them to be engaged and maintain a firm sense of authorship over their representations. This helps to convey a stereotype-free picture of what it means to live in a developing country to those supporting (i.e. funders and voters of the developed country) and doing international development (i.e. NGO and government agencies).Skovdal, M., Cornish, F., (2015) \\"Qualitative Research for Development: A guide for practitioners\\" Rugby, UK: Practical Action Publishing (Chapter 6 - Photovoice: Methodology and Use) In addition, photovoice allows the community to monitor the impact of the change created by development programs. This can help inform the outside agency about the process, true impacts (what is/isn't working and why), and complex reality, thus accompany wider and deeper research and analysis to improve the development progress.

Founded in 1933, the chain is known for its signature sandwiches of grilled meat, melted cheese, an oil & vinegar-based coleslaw, tomato slices, and French fries between two thick slices of Italian bread.Primanti Brothers , Pittsburgh Restaurant Reviews, About.com. During the 2007 James Beard Foundation Awards, Primanti's was named as one of \\"America's Classic\\" restaurants. History The original shop is located at 46 18th Street in Pittsburgh's Strip District, a busy area along the Allegheny River that was once filled with factories, warehouses, and produce yards. According to the restaurant, Joe Primanti, born in suburban Wilmerding, Pennsylvania, invented the sandwich during the Great Depression. His brothers, Dick and Stanley, later joined him. The Primantis opened their diner at Smallman Street and 18th Street in the Strip District and served the late-night and early-morning workers who were unloading fish, fruits, and vegetables. The tradition of the signature sandwiches (typically ordered by number based on a \\"menu\\" written on a huge chalkboard behind the counter) was to combine the sandwich and side of fries, held (grilled) together with eggs as a binding unit, straight from the grill into a hoagie bun. The sandwich was then wrapped in a sheet of newspaper and handed to the customer. This was done so the customer could then go back to his (hopefully loaded) truck and drive back to his shop while managing to eat the sandwich while driving without getting it all over his lap. It has also been a tradition for the late night crowd to go to Primanti's in the Strip District after the bars have closed, due to their hours of operation (at one time they were one of the few establishments open after 2 a.m.). There were several rows of bingo tables with benches and those \\"eating in\\" just crowded into any available space. It was comical to see the bar crowd (typically college students) interacting with the working crowd (typically truck drivers and dock workers from the trains). The unifying factor was usually local sports and Iron City, Duquesne or Rolling Rock 12 oz bottles. With the passing of Stanley Primanti in the early-1970s and John in 1974, Dick decided to sell the business to Jim Patrinos in 1975. Today there are 16 Pittsburgh locations, including at the city's major sports venues PNC Park, Heinz Field, and the PPG Paints Arena, as well as several other locations throughout the eastern United States. =Sports-themed specials= The chain expressed its support for the Pittsburgh Penguins during their back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in their 2015‚Äì16 and 2016‚Äì17 seasons, releasing two limited-time sandwiches in their honor. In 2016, it released a limited-time sandwich honoring the team's third line of Carl Hagelin, Nick Bonino and Phil Kessel, named the \\"HBK Sandwich\\". Late into the next season, the chain then introduced a sandwich called the \\"Canadian Pitts-Burger\\", honoring goaltender Marc-Andr√© Fleury during his eventually final season with the Penguins. The sandwich featured Canadian bacon and was also available at all Primanti Brothers locations for a limited time. Locations Oakland. Primanti Brothers locations are found throughout Pennsylvania, particularly in and around Pittsburgh. In addition to other Pennsylvania locations, restaurants have been established in South Florida, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Michigan and Indiana. Reception The Primanti Bros. version of a cheese steak sandwich. The AA battery, used as a size reference, is 2 inches (5 cm) tall. The restaurant and its signature sandwich have been featured in several national publications and television shows, including National Geographic magazine, Man v. Food, and Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America. Primanti Brothers made the Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes list of \\"1,000 Places to See Before You Die in the USA and Canada\\", and their sandwich is a featured Pittsburgh landmark on Yinztagram. The restaurant was mentioned on the April 21, 2008, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in an interview with Senator Barack Obama. Stewart suggested that Obama visit the restaurant for their \\"great sandwiches\\", which Stewart had enjoyed as a comedian on the club circuit. An ESPN.com rating of PNC Park mentioned that \\"the best [concession] item is the famous Primanti Brothers sandwich, a Pittsburgh institution\\", and granted this \\"signature concession item\\" an exuberant score of \\"5+++\\" (out of 5). This helped PNC Park to achieve its overall #1 ranking in the feature. =Credit card controversy= On March 9, 2011, U.S. District Judge David S. Cercone approved a settlement between Primanti Brothers and a customer in response to a lawsuit over the content of credit card receipts. In the suit, the plaintiff, Nora Hoxha, claimed that the restaurant's credit card receipts printed all, or if not all, too many digits of a customer's credit card number in violation of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. As part of the settlement, the restaurant agreed to provide affected customers with a free menu item and a side item or non-alcoholic drink. The restaurant also agreed to make a donation of $25,000 to the Carnegie Museums and pay up to $62,000 for the plaintiff's attorneys' costs.

Biography Julio and Dino Acconci were born on 9 September 1972 in Macau to an Italian father and a Karen (Myanmar) mother.http://hk.mtvchina.com/Artist/Soler/ They spent their childhood in Macau, The twins were raised Roman Catholic ‚Äì attended Yuet Wah College, an all-boys' Roman Catholic secondary school in Macau. When they reached adulthood, they moved to Italy and began to develop their music career. Later on, Soler was officially formed and became professional musicians signing to EMI Italy in 1996 with the release of their first single in Europe. Prior to their debut in Hong Kong, they returned to Macau in 1999. In 2001 Beyond's guitarist Paul Wong was searching for a guitarist to join his new rock band HANN, and Dino was invited over to Hong Kong for an audition. Dino's friendship with Paul soon led to Paul discovering Dino had a twin, Julio, who was in Julio's own words 'tagging along' to practices, but only after Paul mistook Julio for Dino. The idea of 'Soler' turning professional was a result of peer pressure from the friends of the Acconci brothers, who all echoed the same message ‚Äì that it was a waste of their vocal talent if they didn't at least give Hong Kong a crack. Soler soon turned professional when offered a contract with a new music label after a member of the audience was fascinated with one of their live gigs in Hong Kong. Career Prior to their 2005 debut, as an underground band which performed many live gigs, Soler has over the years developed a musical style that blends rock, soul and folk into one. Their music could best be described as folk rock with a bit of soul. Soler's live performances have had electrifying effects on Hong Kong's usually timid and reserved audience. Soler is also currently the only band from Macau producing Cantonese songs in Hong Kong. The brothers can speak several languages, including English; Cantonese, the official language of Macau; Mandarin; Italian; Portuguese; and Spanish. Dino can also speak a little bit of French. They mainly perform in English, Cantonese and Mandarin but also include Italian and Portuguese in their repertoire. On 15 July 2005, Soler released their debut album \\"Double Surround Sound\\" (ÈõôËÅ≤ÈÅì) which stormed the charts . The album includes songs sung in Cantonese alongside songs in English, with even a few sung in Mandarin. Their debut album sold so well in Hong Kong that Soler moved quickly to release their second album \\"Intuition\\", a Mandarin album, only 5 months later (on 19 December 2005), whilst juggling marketing duties, advertisements and Radio and TV appearances all in the same few months. Beyond's guitarist Paul Wong, is also a big fan of Soler. Prior to Soler's debut, Dino was a band member of the group HANN, a band formed by Paul Wong when he went solo. Wong has also helped to pen lyrics to some of Soler's Cantonese songs, most notable the hit single Tsunami, a song depicting the uphill struggle Soler went through before they became successful. On 7 July 2007 they performed at the Chinese leg of Live Earth in Shanghai. They are also hosts and main actors in English Made Easy 2011 and the third season in 2017. Debut Soler's Hong Kong debut, produced by US-based Lupo Groining, in early 2005 greatly exceeded their own expectations. The Acconci brothers were initially worried that, like their debut in Italy, their Eurasian ancestry would make it difficult for the Hong Kong locals to accept them, although people of mixed or full foreign appearance are usually received with interest rather than rejection by the Chinese people of Hong Kong. However, to their surprise Soler was a storming success ‚Äì as soon as their first song \\"Soul Lost\\" (Â§±È≠Ç) was aired on radio, listeners sat up and took notice of the 'gweilo band who sang in Cantonese'. With their popularity soaring, Soler became extremely busy as they were surrounded by the media and paparazzi, but with that Soler have also remained modest. They are fondly known to the media as \\"The Italian twins band\\", and it is now very common to hear their songs on Hong Kong radio channels, as well as seeing them make regular appearances on TV, print media and radio interviews. Commercial Radio 903 D.J. Inti, who hosts a popular weekly rock music programme on Saturday evenings, has been credited as one of the first people to help unearth the talented duo by inviting them onto her show \\"Band Time\\" (ÁµÑBAND ÊôÇÈñì) on 18 May 2005, a time when Soler was still not yet well known to the Hong Kong public. Inti's radio programme \\"Band Time\\" introduces overseas band music as well as introducing local Hong Kong underground bands with interviews. =Contract dispute and bankruptcy= Soler was a recording group with Hummingbird Music, however due to artistic differences, Soler left the company and signed to BMA Records. Hummingbird Music sued the group for not fulfilling the contract, which the court ruled Soler must pay the record company HK$6 Million in reparations including accrued interests. In 2012, the record company filed Soler for bankruptcy.

Starting in Nagano Prefecture, it is told about in the Ch≈´bu region and also in parts of the T≈çkai region, southern Kant≈ç region, T≈çhoku region, and so on. There are no legends of kudagitsune in Kant≈ç besides the Chiba Prefecture and Kanagawa Prefecture, and this is said to be because Kant≈ç is the domain of the osaki. Just like its name says, there are various legends about how they are small enough to fit into a bamboo pipe or about as big as a match box and would multiply until there were 75 of them, and so on. Another name for them is \\"izuna\\" (È£ØÁ∂±, meaning least weasel), and psychics in Niigata, the Ch≈´bu region, and the Kant≈ç region and \\"izuna-tsukai\\" (È£ØÁ∂±‰Ωø„ÅÑ, \\"izuna- users\\") in Shinsh≈´ have these and use them to gain supernatural powers and make divinations. It is believed that izuna-tsukai (izuna-users) make use of izuna for beneficial religious uses such as foretelling prophecies, and at the same time also for evil purposes such as to fulfill requests to make the izuna go possess and give illness to someone the requester hates.

It is said that the kudagitsune, following the master's will, would procure goods from other families, so a family that keeps and raises a kudagitsune would gradually grow wealthy, but it is also said that although the family does grow wealthy at first, the kudagitsune would multiply until there were 75 of them, and so they would eventually eat away at the family's wealth making them decline. is a creature supposedly employed by Japanese kitsune-tsukai, those who use foxes as spirit familiars. Its use is described in various books, as follows: In the the kuda- gitsune is described as a rat-sized fox which can be kept in a pipe. Overview According to the the kanko is a fox the size of a weasel or rat, with vertical eyes and thin hair. The magic-user summons the kanko to appear inside a bamboo pipe he is holding, whereupon the fox will answer all the questions it is asked. The origin of this practice is traced back to a yamabushi who obtained this art while undergoing strict asceticism on Mount Kinpu. These Kanko are said to be numerous in the northern mountains of Suruga, T≈çt≈çmi, and Mikawa Provinces.

His primary field of study was scientific axiology (the science of value) and he is known as its original theorist. His axiology is the basis of the Hartman Value Inventory (also known as the \\"Hartman Value Profile (HVP)\\",https://www.hartmaninstitute.org/about/hartman-value-profile/ which is used in psychology to measure the character of an individual.  Early life  Robert S. Hartman was born in Berlin, Germany on January 27, 1910. He studied at the German College of Political Science, and also at the University of Paris, the London School of Economics, and at the University of Berlin from which he received an LL.B. degree in1932. He started working as instructor in administrative law and the philosophy of law at the University of Berlin, and he also served as Assistant Judge of the District court, Berlin- Charlottenburg. In 1932 he left Germany for Britain and \\"started working for Walt Disney Productions as a copyright representative in Britain and later opened offices for Disney in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden where he met and married his wife. The Hartmans moved to Mexico City where he represented Disney Productions in Central America and the Antilles.\\"The Robert S. Hartman Collection, 1910-1973, retrieved 15 April 2008. [dead link, no archived version found]  Career  Hartman's rejection of Fascism brought him into conflict with the Nazi party and forced him to leave Germany, using a fake passport, in 1932. He legally changed his name, which originally was Robert Schirokauer, to the name on his passport, Robert S. (for Schirokauer) Hartman. In 1938, using a Swedish alien¬ís passport, he, his wife, and son left Europe for Mexico, where they lived until their immigration in 1941 to the United States, where they later became citizens. In 1941 he migrated to the United States and became a citizen. He did his doctoral work in philosophy at Northwestern University in 1946. He taught at the University of Berlin and at Lake Forest Academy near Chicago. He was a professor of philosophy at the College of Wooster (1945 - 1948) and at Ohio State University (1948 - 1956) and was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1955 - 1956) and at Yale University in 1966. Hartman was a Research Fellow and Exchange Professor at the National University of Mexico from 1956 - 1957, and from 1957 until his death he was a research professor of philosophy there. From 1968 until his death Hartman also held an appointment as a professor of philosophy at the University of Tennessee. In the late 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research. From 1950-1957 he was Chairman of the Commission on Peace for the International Council of Community Churches. He served as Executive Director of the Council of Profit- Sharing Industries, and wrote its first manual. He was a founder of the Deutsche Institute fur Social-Wirtschaftliche Betriebsgestaltung (industrial organization). He was a founding sponsor of the American Association for Humanistic Psychology. He has been credited with being the founding spirit behind the prevailing business-retirement plan in the United States today, the 401K Plan. He was the first President of the American Society for Value Inquiry, founded in 1971 by James Wilbur. He served as consultant for the practical application of Value Theory with AT&T;, General Foods, General Electric, and IBM.  Death  Hartman died in Cuernavaca, Mexico on September 20, 1973. He had one child, a son, Jan. Jan Hartman was an Emmy-winning screenwriter, author, and playwright. He died of heart failure in October 2006. For the previous 10 years, Jan lived in Hertfordshire, England, with his wife, Stacey McNutt, a book editor.  Work  He was the subject of doctoral dissertations, including that of a former Chairman of the Philosophy Department at the University of Tennessee, Professor John Davis, as well as of Marvin Charles Katz, whose thesis was later published as a book entitled Trends Towards Synthesis. He has published papers on the phenomenology of group measurement, on universal constants in Physics (in his role as a philosopher of science), on the logic of description and valuation, on the contribution of St. Anselm, and on the Concept of Self in S√∏ren Kierkegaard. = Value theory = The reference book Who Knows What listed Hartman as one of the two living authorities on value theory (the other was Charles W. Morris (1903-1979). Among Hartman's publications are the report on Value Theory for the Institut International de Philosophis 1949-1955, published by UNESCO; his magnum opus The Structure of Value (1967 Southern Illinois University Press); and at the time of his death in 1973 he was working on a manuscript entitled The Measurement of Value. Another critical work is his Knowledge of Good (Robert S. Hartman, Arthur Ellis and Rem B. Edwards, 2002 Rodopi Press) a thorough study of all the philosophical discussions of goodness and what gaps exist in a complete philosophy of value. Hartman shows how his Formal Value Theory fills these gaps. Robert S. Hartman Institute The Robert S. Hartman Institute for Formal and Applied Axiology was founded in 1976https://www.hartmaninstitute.org/ and exists for the sole purpose of advancing the axiological work of Robert S. Hartmanhttps://www.hartmaninstitute.org/mission-and-purpose. The Institute was developed in cooperation with heirs of Robert S. Hartman to advance study relating to Robert S. Hartman's unpublished and unfinished works held in the collections of the graduate library of the University of Tennessee, Knoxvillehttps://www.hartmaninstitute.org/access-hartman-s-research. The Hartman Institute affirms the importance of a diversity of approaches to the formalization, interpretation, and application of Hartman‚Äôs theory, and it has no allegiance to any particular business model or organization.https://www.hartmaninstitute.org/mission-and-purpose =The Journal of Formal Axiology= The Journal of Formal Axiology is published once a year, since 2008, by the Robert S. Hartman Institute. Each edition is focused on advancing formal axiology and the value theory of Robert.S. Hartman and includes articles dealing primarily with axiological practice and application, as well as with theoretical issueshttps://rshi.memberclicks.net/journal-of-formal-axiology. Articles may be critical, constructive, creative, theoretical, or applied, and are focused on advancing our understanding of Hartmanian axiology and/or what can be done with ithttps://rshi.memberclicks.net/journal-of-formal-axiology. =Membership Types= The Robert S. Hartman Institute is a volunteer-run organization made up of a global membership basehttps://rshi.memberclicks.net/member-benefits- and-options. Membership types include Professional Membership, Teacher/Instructor Membership, Student Membership, and Axiological Service Provider Membershiphttps://rshi.memberclicks.net/axiological-service-provider- requirements.  Published Works  Hartman was a prolific writer with some of his works published and many available in their original manuscript form at the University of Tennessee Knoxville Archives. The Robert S. Hartman Institute is working diligently to bring as many of these manuscripts to publication as possible. = The Structure of Value: Foundations of Scientific Axiology = Hartman's revolutionary book introduces formal orderly thinking into value theory. It identifies three basic kinds of value, intrinsic goods (e.g. people as ends in themselves), extrinsic goods (e.g. things and actions as means to ends), and systemic goods (conceptual values). All good things share a common formal or structural pattern: they fulfill the ideal standards or \\"concepts\\" that we apply to them. Thus, this theory is called \\"formal axiology\\" Some values are richer in good-making property-fulfillment than others, so some desirable things are better than others and form patterned hierarchies of value. How we value is just as important as what we value, and evaluations, like values, share structures or formal patterns, as this book demonstrates. Hartman locates all of this solidly within the framework of historical value theory, but he moves successfully and creatively beyond philosophical tradition and toward the creation of a new value science = The Knowledge of Good: Critique of Axiological Reason = This book presents Robert S. Hartman's formal theory of value and critically examines many other twentieth century value theorists in its light. = Five Lectures on Formal Axiology = During the final decade or so of his life, Hartman frequently delivered a series of lectures in which he outlined the need for a scientific theory of human values, the theoretical requirements demanded of an effective value theory, and his rationale behind the development of the particular value theory he developed, which he named formal axiology. He named these lectures, collectively, Five Lectures in Formal Axiology. Written as they were for oral delivery, they have a cadence and clarity to them that make them a pleasure to read. Hartman concludes these lectures with a description of how his theory might be applied in various real-world situations. Specifically, he discusses how formal axiology can be applied to studies of economics and political economies, including profit sharing; to international affairs, including matters of war and peace; and to personal ethics. To Hartman, nothing less than the survival of human existence depends on this. = The Revolution Against War: Selected Writings on War and Peace = Hartman devoted much of his extraordinary intellectual capacity to understanding and articulating the political, philosophical, psychological, and spiritual causes of war so that humankind could stop waging war and start living together in peace. This collection of essays by Hartman reveal, for the first time in one place, the range and depth of his thoughts on this subject. It also traces how his own understanding of the role of war in human society evolved during his lifetime. It was his study of war that led, in large part, to his development of the value theory for which he is best known‚Äîformal axiology. Hartman's ideas, if understood and embraced, may well lead to fulfillment of his hope that we can learn to live in peace.

At the end of the Vietnam War several units were brought back to the United States and deactivated or redesignated, creating 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing as it is constituted today. =The Gulf War & the 1990s= The wing saw action again as part of I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF), conducting operations in Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. It deployed over 40 squadrons of aircraft, flew over 18,000 sorties while operating from 6 airfields throughout the theater.Warren: 403-404. After the end of hostilities, 3rd MAW aircraft provided support in Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Southern Watch over Iraq. The wing was once more called into service in Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. In 1999, 3rd MAW relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California. =Global War on Terror= The fall of 2001 saw the beginning of the War on Terrorism, and 3rd MAW since deployed several detachments in support of the ongoing Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In the fall of 2002, the wing began deploying to Kuwait to prepare for combat operations in Iraq.

VEIL is compatible with multiple formats of video signals, including PAL, SECAM, and NTSC. The technology is based on a steganographically encoded data stream in the luminance of the videosignal. A recent application of VEIL, the VEIL Rights Assertion Mark (VRAM or V-RAM) is a copy-restriction signal that can be used to ask devices to apply DRM technology. This has been seen as analogous to the broadcast flag. It is also known as \\"CGMS-A plus VEIL\\" and \\"broadcast flag on steroids.\\" There are two versions of VEIL on the market: * VEIL-I, or VEIL 1, has raw speed of 120 bits per second. It is used for unidirectional communication (TV‚Üídevices) with simple devices or toys, and to deliver coupons with TV advertising. It manipulates the luminance of the video signal in ways difficult to perceive to human eye. * VEIL-II, or VEIL 2, has speed of 7200-bit/s and is one of the technologies of choice for interactive television, as it allows communication with VEIL servers through devices equipped with backchannels. VEIL-II-capable set-top boxes can communicate with other devices via WiFi, Bluetooth, or other short-range wireless technologies. VEIL 2 manipulates the average luminance of the alternate lines of the signal, where one is slightly raised and the other one is slightly lowered (or vice versa), encoding a bit in every pair of lines. The symbols (groups of 4 data bits) transmitted by VEIL-II system are encoded as \\"PN sequences\\", sequences of 16 \\"chips\\". Groups of 4 chips are encoded in pairs of lines. Each line pair is split to 4 parts, where the luminance is raised or lowered (correspondingly vice versa in the other line). In NTSC, 4-bit symbols are encoded in groups of 8 scan lines. With 224 lines per field this equals 112 bits per field, or 7200 bits per second of broadcast. VEIL-II uses scan lines 34 to 258. The PN stands for \\"pseudo noise\\" and signifies the 0.5/0.5 relative frequencies of ones and zeroes. In practice, 20 chips per line are preferred, increasing redundancy and allowing for better error detection. The PN encoding is a form of spread spectrum modulation. Stripping the VEIL signal from the video is supposed to be more difficult than tampering with the VBI, therefore VEIL-I is proposed as a DRM tool. The signal can survive recording to video, and various sorts of digital compression. The detection devices are low-cost and can be used in a range of devices, from toys to cellphones.  Use in toys  The technology was developed for The Batman TV series, for transmitting data from the video on- screen to a line of Batman toys based on the series, supplying them with information about the series and unlocking their hidden capabilities. For example: * The Batwave Communicator Handheld Device, when within 10 feet in the line of sight from the TV, will show engine graphics, diagnostics, weapon systems, and enables various games stored in the device. * Batwave Batman Action Figure will pop wings from its back and light up the emblem on its chest when subjected to the videosignal from the TV. * Batwave Batmobile with Handheld Device will turn on various LEDs acting as its lights, play sounds, and \\"capture\\" various weapons from the show. This technology is also used in other toys, for example Toby Terrier. VEIL was used in various ad campaigns for Foster's Lager. The campaign incorporated the use of VEIL decoders inside little figures of the famous cricket players Boon and Shane Warne. The toys would make comments during the cricket matches while in front of the television. Other uses As of December 2005, VEIL was proposed as a DRM tool to counter the analog hole, as a technological measure legally enforced by the US Digital Content Security Act. In this regard, it is a more fine- grained successor to Macrovision. VEIL acts together with CGMS-A signal (\\"broadcast flag\\") in the vertical blanking interval, where it is used to encode the Rights Assertion Mark (RAM) signal. The CGMS-A can be stripped too easily from the analog signal, therefore the presence of RAM but absence of CGMS-A will tell the copy protection system to deny the copy.

Those considered anti-social included primarily the Romani but it was also used until 1942 to describe alcoholics, homeless, beggars, nomads, and prostitutes. Women deemed to be anti-social included sex-workers, nonconformists, and lesbians. The term \\"asocial\\" was originally applied to heterosexual women who engaged in sex outside of marriage, which included prostitutes. Usage The black triangle in the context of the marking system for prisoners in Nazi concentration camps. =Nazi= The symbol originates from Nazi Germany, where every prisoner had to wear a concentration camp badge on their prison clothes, of which the design and color categorized them according to the reason for their internment. The homeless were included, as were alcoholics, those who habitually avoided labor and employment, draft dodgers, pacifists, Roma and Sinti people, and others. = Romani = While the black triangle was originally a symbol for many groups, by the beginning of the Final Solution it was being exclusively used for Romani people. The Final Solution included the extermination of all Romani people. =Lesbian= Nazis considered lesbians anti-social and a huge threat to the purity of German society, hence the badge was used to identify them. =Disabled people= Some UK groups concerned with the rights of disabled people have adopted the symbol in their campaigns. Such groups cite press coverage and government policies, including changes to incapacity benefits and disability living allowance, as the reasons for their campaigns. \\"The Black Triangle List\\" was created to keep track of welfare-related deaths due to cuts by the Department for Work and Pensions.

She won Badminton three consecutive years (1957‚Äì1959), and was the first woman rider in the UK to achieve international success. Biography Born on 12 March 1936, Willcox began riding in childhood, and participated in Pony Club. She rode in her first three-day event with partner High and Mighty, an Arabian/pony cross, in 1955 at the young age of eighteen. Her first ride around Badminton occurred a year later, where she managed to capture second place. After a few more years Willcox won the event with High and Mighty in 1957, leading the competition start to finish. She won the Badminton title again with High and Mighty the next year, with a 22-point lead after dressage, widening to a 47-point lead by the end of the event. Willcox also competed in the 1957 European Championships with High and Mighty, earning both team and individual gold medals. The partnerships also won a team gold at the 1959 European Championships. However, women were not allowed to ride in the Olympic Three-Day competition at this time, and so she was unable to participate. Her mount was sold to Ted Marsh, to be used by the British Team, although High and Mighty was, in the end, never selected. Sheila Willcox married, becoming Sheila Waddington, and returned to Badminton in 1959 with her new, and inexperienced, mount Airs and Graces. She won the dressage, but had to go slow cross-country due to the ground conditions. However, a rail down in show jumping by fellow competitor David Somerset allowed her to clinch the win. To this day, she is the only rider to have won Badminton three years running. Willcox also won Little Badminton in 1964, riding Glenamoy. Willcox competed successfully for several years, winning eight major titles. However, a fall in 1971 at the Tidworth Horse Trials left her partially paralyzed, and she gave up eventing and focused on dressage. She went on to gain success in this equestrian sport as well, reaching the Grand Prix level on Son and Heir. She died on 9 June 2017 at the age of 81.Three-time Badminton winner Sheila Willcox dies aged 81 References * Sly, Debbie and Hugh Thomas. Badminton Horse Trials: The Triumphs and the Tears.

They are first known from the Middle Carboniferous (late Serpukhovian or early Bashkirian in age), and include some of the earliest known flying insects. Overview Despite their very early appearance in the insect fossil record, they represent a specialised group of Palaeodictyopteroidea (Palaeozoic beaked insects), unique among representatives of that group in having evolved the ability to fold their wings over their thorax and abdomen in a manner similar to, but not homologous with, the Neopteran insects. The nymphs also had an unusual appearance, being covered in numerous hairlike filaments. Diaphanopterodea are distinguished by a number of other characteristics, and are generally considered to be a monophyletic group. About ten families are known. The group died out at the end of the Permian period, victims of the End-Permian mass-extinction, without leaving any descendants. References * Carpenter, F. M. 1992. Superclass Hexapoda.

The original station was made of wood. It was later torn down and temporarily replaced with a board-and-batten shed close to Woodstock, which created much local indignation. A new brick station to replace it was constructed at the West Hurley Dike of the Ashokan Reservoir. The depot was torn down in 1967. Water service was available for steam engines at this station. A water tower was located northwest of the station, which served water plugs located between the tracks. Present condition The West Hurley station area still retains a single, siding that was used by the railroad to store the first half of a train when it was necessary to break a train while coming up the 2% grade from Kingston. The Catskill Mountain Railroad planned to use the siding as a storage track for four passenger cars, a ballast hopper and a gondola, which were to be brought up from Kingston in 2007. The foundations of the depot are still easily seen, and the CMRR planned to further clear out the area around the station and the siding in 2007.

Although still a very difficult character to beat, he is portrayed as being considerably weaker than he is in the comics. He also has a specific set of stylized sound effects whenever his powers are used. Additionally, his personality is very similar to Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's original comics, the same one used by John Byrne in the reboot of the DC Universe from 1986: somewhat rough and aggressive, although remaining the personification of moral excellence. *Superman first appears in his eponymous series. As with the comics, he is the sole survivor of Krypton's demise, caused by Brainiac in this continuity. He is portrayed with the same powers and weaknesses, but like average people of Earth cannot breathe in space and thus requires a space suit. He also wears a special lead suit for protection against kryptonite. Superman's reputation becomes jeopardized in the two-parter Legacy, where he gets brainwashed by Darkseid and set upon Earth, losing the trust of many, including Professor Hamilton and giving Lex Luthor an advantage. His baby age, who only appears in The Last Son of Krypton, the first episode, is voiced by Jesse Batten. His teenaged self, who only appears in The Last Son of Krypton, as well as the episode New Kids in Town, is voiced by Jason Marsden. Tim Daly voices the adult character. *Superman next appears in the Batman Beyond two- parter The Call. He wears a different suit of black and silver, but is shown to have aged slower than anyone on Earth, due to his Kryptonian DNA, as Bruce Wayne jokes about. He is first shown disguised as a bystander that is taken hostage by Inque, but he quickly reveals himself and takes her out. He then shows up at the Batcave to recruit Terry McGinnis, the new Batman, into the Justice League, apparently in order to help him find a traitor within the league. Bruce and Terry both discover the traitor to be Superman himself, and Bruce gives Terry a piece of kryptonite, referring to the events of Legacy. However, it is then discovered that Superman had been under the control of a starfish-like alien (Starro) that he had saved a long time ago. Terry frees Superman, and the two help the rest of the league send the aliens back. Superman was voiced by Christopher McDonald, the voice of Jor-El in the DCAU, due to an idea that Superman sounds more like his father as he ages. *Superman next appears in Justice League, now voiced by George Newbern. Daly was supposed to return, and had even done initial recordings, but was ultimately too involved with other television shows and had to be replaced. Superman, having already got back his reputation that Darkseid had put at stake, forms the league, along with Batman. He begins to wonder about what might happen to him after the events of the Justice Lords, what with his counterpart giving into the urge and killing Luthor. Superman was originally designed with a shine in his hair, along with wrinkles and squintier eyes in order to make him look more detailed, but was redesigned again with his look from Superman after it was not well received. *Newbern returns to the role of Superman in Static Shock, where he helps the title character battle against Toyman. In this series, Superman is given full eyes with blue irises, compared to his other appearances within the DCAU. *Superman is again voiced by Newbern in Justice League Unlimited. In this series, he nearly gives into the urge to become like his Justice Lord counterpart, attempting to lobotomize Doomsday, who he instead finally banished into the Phantom Zone, much to the questioning of Batman and the general public. His doubts about not being like his Justice Lord counterpart are fleshed out in Divided We Fall, where a mechanical duplicate of his counterpart points out about his trust from the public and his power. Superman insists that he is not like his counterpart at all. Most noteworthy is after Flash apparently died defeating the Lex Luthor/ Braniac hybrid, he brought Luthor to eye level and said: \\"I'm not the man that killed President Luthor. Right now, I wish to heaven that I were, but I'm not.\\" It was because of this, Superman considered shutting down the Justice League, only to be talked out of it by Green Arrow. During the series finale, Destroyer, Superman briefly gets the upper hand on a resurrected Darkseid. He explains \\"I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard.\\", saying that he thus is always taking care of not to attack too hard or he might kill someone. With Darkseid, however, he says \\"But you can take it, can't you big man. What we have here is a rare opportunity for me to cut loose, and show you just how powerful I really am.\\" and punches Darkseid hard into the sky, through several buildings, and knocks him back into the ground, creating a huge crater. Darkseid then stuns Superman using the Agony Matrix, which causes him to feel extreme pain in every part of his body, and is about to kill him with a kryptonite knife when he is saved by Luthor, whom had agreed with Superman to stop Darkseid, or in his case, get revenge on him for taking a piece of Brainiac from him. Superman/Batman Mitch Watson revealed that there was a planned Superman/Batman animated series which Clark as a cub reporter coming to Gotham City, where he meets Bruce and begins his career as Superman.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media. WPRO's studio and transmitter (along with the studios for Cumulus' other Providence stations) are located in East Providence, at the Salty Brine Broadcast Center, named after WPRO's longtime morning host. WPRO programming is also heard on 99.7 WEAN-FM. The station is affiliated with the Westwood One Network, a subsidiary of parent company Cumulus Media. Programming Much of WPRO's weekday lineup is locally produced. WPRO is an affiliate of the New England Patriots Radio Network. It had carried Boston Red Sox baseball from 1986 to 2005. In 2006, the affiliation moved to WEEI-FM (now WVEI-FM). History The earliest ancestor to WPRO, WKBF, began broadcasting from Cranston, Rhode Island on June 15, 1924, owned by Dutee Wilcox Flint and operating at 1050 kHz; in January 1925, the call letters were changed to WDWF, reflecting the owner's initials, and the station moved to 680 kHz That December, Lincoln Studios began to share ownership of the station with Flint; Lincoln broadcast its programming under the call sign WLSI. WDWF and WLSI moved to 800 kHz. by June 30, 1927, to 1090 kHz in October, to 1150 kHz in November, and to 1210 kHz in February 1928. By 1930, the studios for WDWF and WLSI were located in Providence. =The Cherry & Webb era (September 1931‚ÄìApril 1959)= Providence department store Cherry & Webb acquired the station in September 1931, and merged the two stations under a single license with the call letters WPRO. The merged station formally relaunched on October 16. The purchase made Cherry & Webb the third department store in Providence to get into radio broadcasting, after the 1922 launches of Shepard Stores' WEAN (now WPRV, a sister station to WPRO) and The Outlet Company's WJAR (now WHJJ). The following February, Cherry & Webb purchased another station at 1210 kHz, WPAW in nearby Pawtucket, which had been granted a license in August 1926 as WFCI, owned by Frank Cook Inc. and operating at 1160 kHz, moved to 1330 kHz by June 30, 1927, to 1240 that August, and to 1210 kHz in November 1928, concurrent with the change to WPAW. Following the acquisition, the station used WPAW in tandem with WPRO until 1933. The station moved to its current frequency, 630 kHz, in 1934. WPRO was an affiliate of the short-lived American Broadcasting System in 1935; in 1937, the station joined the CBS Radio Network, replacing charter affiliate WEAN. Although WPRO's city of license was changed from Cranston to Providence soon after Cherry & Webb took over, the station's transmitter remained in Cranston until its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane; it then constructed a new transmission facility in East Providence. FM service was added on April 17, 1948 with the debut of WPRO-FM (92.3 MHz), and a television sister station, WPRO-TV (channel 12), went on the air March 27, 1955. =The CapCities era (April 1959‚Äì1993)= Cherry & Webb exited broadcasting in April 1959, selling the WPRO stations to Capital Cities Television Corporation, which eventually became Capital Cities Communications. Soon afterward, WPRO ended its CBS Radio affiliation and became Providence's top-rated top 40 station, competing against WICE (now WPPB) and, later, WGNG (now WSJW). The station's studios were moved to the transmitter location in East Providence in 1974; WPRO's previous studio location, which until then had also continued to house what had become WPRI-TV even after that station was sold by Capital Cities in 1967, was then donated to public television station WSBE-TV. That same year, WPRO-FM adopted its own top 40 format, and the AM side began a gradual evolution to adult contemporary that would continue through the remainder of the decade. During the 1980s, the station again began to shift its format by gradually adding talk shows to its schedule; it also became an affiliate of ABC Radio by 1984, two years before ABC was purchased by Capital Cities. WPRO discontinued its remaining music programming on March 20, 1989, moving to an all-talk format. =Tele-Media takes over (1993‚Äìpresent)= Capital Cities/ABC sold WPRO to Tele-Media in 1993; this put the station under common ownership with WLKW (the former WEAN) and WWLI. Tele- Media, in turn, sold its stations to Citadel Broadcasting (which would eventually purchase the radio assets of former station owner ABC [by then part of Disney] in 2007) in 1997. WPRO added its simulcast on WEAN-FM on March 11, 2008. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. Citadel Broadcasting was purchased by Cumulus Radio in 2013. =Former on-air staff= WPRO's longest-serving on-air staff member was Salty Brine, who served as the station's morning host from 1943 until April 28, 1993. Other former WPRO voices include sportscaster Bryan Fustukian (as Vik Armen). New York media personalities who previously worked at WPRO include WABC host Mark Simone, WMCA \\"Good Guy\\" Jack Spector, WCBS-TV correspondent Magee Hickey, CBS staff announcer Hal Simms, WCBS-FM personality Dave Stewart (as David Spencer on WPRO), and former Providence mayor Buddy Cianci until his death on January 27, 2016.

Overview Cited as \\"a leading light of the Michigan space-rock scene\\" by AllMusic, the minimalist group formed in 1993 around the core husband-and-wife duo of guitarist Carl Hultgren and bassist/singer Windy Weber. (Most of the band's pieces feature no vocals, however.) The band was prolific from the outset up to 2001, whereupon they took a hiatus of a few years. The music of Windy & Carl borrows heavily from the sounds of 1980s era bands on 4AD Records, specifically that of Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and various other dream pop and shoegazer acts. Unlike noteworthy prior drone/ambient artists (such as Cluster, Brian Eno, Popol Vuh, et al.), Windy & Carl's drones are primarily derived from guitar, particularly via usage of delay effects, reverb effects, and E-Bow, rather than synthesizers. Another noteworthy aspect of W&C;'s sound is the absence of drums. History \\"Hultgren first began recording instrumental guitar drone pieces in 1992, when he self-released a cassette tape named Portal before teaming up with Weber\\". It was later reissued on CD by BaDaBing owner Ben Goldberg. Windy & Carl then participated in Darla Records' Bliss Out Series in 1997, contributing the maxi-EP Antarctica. That year, they also issued the limited-edition album/maxi-EP A Dream of Blue on U.K. label Ochre Records, with individually painted cover art by Weber (on the 10\\" vinyl version). Depths was released by Kranky in early 1998. In 1999, the couple teamed up with synthesist Greg Gasiorowski to record under the name Five Way Mirror. They released a few singles under that moniker, in addition to Transcendence, a 1999 full-length album. Consciousness came out on Kranky in 2001. The band then went on hiatus (after Weber's mom died), returning with Dream House/ Dedications to Flea in 2005. (Flea was their recently deceased dog.) There was a singles compilation released in 2001, Introspection, which is 3 CDs of singles, live tracks and previously unreleased recordings. In 2006, they released Akimatsuri, a one track (33:16 min) limited album under their label Blue Flea. It was recorded at their home between March and October 2006. The unique track is made up of 5 subtracks. Windy & Carl have been a mainstay of the various Terrastock music festivals. In the fall of 2000 they released a CD with The Lothars, titled & Windy & Carl & The Lothars that featured live performances by each band from the San Francisco Terrastock festival as well as a 28-minute collaborative piece recorded at the London Terrastock festival. The group has issued several other split recordings as well as a 3-CD box set, Introspection: Singles & Rarities 1993-2000. They embarked on a national tour in the summer of 2001 with Landing; the bands released a split tour-only EP to commemorate it. A highlight of this tour was being able to perform a private audience show for Sonic Youth. October 2008 saw the release of Songs for the Broken Hearted ‚Äì their 4th album in 11 years for Kranky. In December 2008, American webzine Somewhere Cold ranked Songs for the Broken Hearted No. 5 on their 2008 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame.

It is located on Missouri Supplemental Route E, approximately ten miles east of Pineville. Powell is located on Big Sugar Creek. The community includes some homes, a couple of businesses, and a post office. It is part of the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, AR-MO Metropolitan Statistical Area. The 1915 Powell Bridge, a single-lane pin-connected Pratt through truss bridge, is 0.4 mile southwest of the community and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. A new bridge beside the 1915 structure handles all vehicular traffic, while the old Powell Bridge serves as a pedestrian crossing.  History  This community sits near the juncture of Big Sugar Creek and Mikes Creek. Powell was once a thriving community and still retains many remnants of this time. At one time it had multiple general stores, a blacksmith, a gas station, several churches and a watermill. One of its general store buildings still stands and is occasionally in operation as is the Albert E. Brumley and Sons/Hartford Music Company, which has operated out of Powell since the 1940s. Owned and operated by the late gospel composer Albert E. Brumley, the hymn and songbook publishing operation is now run by his son Robert Brumley. Albert E. Brumley's best known song, \\"I'll Fly Away (hymn)\\" has been recorded by multiple Grammy Award winning musicians and even inspired the name of a television series. Brumley also started an annual, though now defunct, Hill and Hollow craft fair and concert in a field next to his house in Powell. Through the years such celebrities as Minnie Pearl and Grandpa Jones, of country music and Hee Haw fame, performed at the venue. Brumley, along with his wife, the former Goldie Schell, are buried in Fox Cemetery just outside Powell, along with other local pioneers. Several older structures still exist in the community, but are no longer in use, such as the First Baptist Church building, the Hill and Hollow exhibit hall and an old gas station.

Founded in 1949, it is considered one of the best universities in South Korea. Kyung Hee University is part of the Kyung Hee University System, which offers comprehensive education from kindergarten through graduate school. As of 2018, about 33,000 students were enrolled in Kyung Hee University. The university is composed of 23 undergraduate colleges, 1 general graduate school, 13 speciality graduate schools and 49 auxiliary research institutions. The university offers a study abroad program in partnership with 434 sister universities in 69 countries. Kyung Hee University is known for its prestigious College of Korean Medicine, which is considered a leading school in traditional Korean medicine and other traditional Asian medical practices.  History  Kyung Hee University originated in 1949 as Sin Heung Junior College, a 2-year college. Amid the financial crisis of the Korean War, Young Seek Choue bought the struggling school in 1951 and had it accredited as a 4-year undergraduate college in 1952. In 1954, the graduate school was established. The college was renamed Kyung Hee University in 1960. The university hosted the 1968 conference of the International Association of University Presidents, first proposed in 1981 the UN International Day of Peace, organized the 1999 Seoul International Conference of NGOs, held the 2009 World Civic Forum, ran the 2011 UNAI-Kyung Hee International Symposium, and has spearheaded the Global Common Society movement. In 1993 Kyung Hee received the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education. In 2006, Kyung Hee and the University of Pennsylvania initiated the Penn-Kyung Hee Collaborative Summer Program and two years later a formal Global Collaborative with Peking, Ritsumeikan, and Moscow State universities; the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs; and the Conference of NGOs (CoNGO). Symbols The university emblem is the Chinese character for \\"university\\" and has a world map in the background. This symbolizes Kyung Hee's vision for globalization as well as an open mind and humanism for the world. The university mascot is visualized through the mane of the Laughing Lion, the torch which sheds light on the truth, and the dove, an international symbol of peace. Magnolia is the official flower of Kyung Hee University and the magnolia logo embodies the qualities that Kyung Hee stands for such as resilience, beauty, generosity, and unity.

In 1972 its researchers demonstrated a drug-free acupunctural anesthesia. In 1998 Kyung Hee established the International Studies of Korean Medicine to broaden its reach to international scholars. The following year it established the Graduate School of East-West Medicine Science (GSM) in order to blend Eastern and Western diagnostic methods. The College of Korean Medicine and the Graduate School of Medicine have integrated the two traditions within the Kyung Hee Medical Center and active collaboration occurs between the college and the biomedical engineering department on acupuncture therapy, chronic medical conditions, palsy, and geriatric diseases. The medical center is divided into the General Hospital, Dental Hospital, Korean Medicine Hospital, East-West Medical Center, and the Medical Science Research Institute. In a 1999 study, the Kyung Hee Korean medicine curriculum consisted of 60 percent Eastern and 40 percent Western research and practice. Physical education The Dept. of Physical Education at KHU was set up as the Dept. of Physical Education in Korea in 1949, and became a stepping stone to play a pivotal role in Korean Physical education. It was promoted to the college of Physical education upon completing the construction of the largest gym in Asia in 1955. The doctoral program was opened in 1980 for the first ever time in Korea. Currently, five departments are operated within the college of Physical education: Physical Edu, Sports medicine, coaching, Golf management and Taekwondo.  Campus  Kyung Hee University has three campuses. The university's original campus is Seoul Campus (245 acres), located in the Dongdaemun District of Seoul, and established in 1954. In 1979, the university established its second campus, the Global Campus (510 acres) in Yongin, near Suwon.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media, and airs a Talk radio format. The station's studios are located in East Providence and the transmitter site is located separately in East Providence just east of the Seekonk River. The station operates at 5,000 watts around the clock and serves the Providence metropolitan area. While its sister stations WPRO and WEAN-FM simulcast mostly local talk shows, WPRV's schedule mainly comes from nationally syndicated talk programs, much of which are produced by Cumulus Media subsidiary Westwood One, along with some locally produced brokered programming in afternoon drive. Programming WPRV is the Providence affiliate for First Light, America in the Morning, The Chris Plante Show, The Dave Ramsey Show, The Mark Levin Show, The Savage Nation, Red Eye Radio and Westwood One News, the latter airing at the top of each hour. The station also serves as the Providence affiliate for the New York Yankees Radio Network, the Boston Celtics Radio Network, and also carries Brown University football and men's basketball. History WPRV was originally WEAN, Rhode Island's first radio station (that callsign now belongs to a sister FM station). WEAN's first broadcast was on Friday evening, June 2, 1922, for the benefit of \\"Block Aid\\". The broadcast was arranged in conjunction with the radio editor of the newspaper The Providence News. WEAN would receive its first license 3 days later, on June 5, 1922.The F.C.C.'s history cards for WEAN; retrieved April 3, 2019. WEAN was originally owned by the Shepard Stores of Boston, and starting in the late 1920s, received programming from Boston sister station WNAC, now WRKO. This would form the cornerstone of the Yankee Network, a regional radio service feeding newscasts and other programs throughout the region. In the early 1950s, WEAN was sold to the Providence Journal-Bulletin newspaper. By the 1960s, WEAN was a middle-of- the-road outlet, transitioning to adult contemporary music by the 1970s. From 1975 to 1977, WEAN was an affiliate of NBC's short-lived News And Information Service, or \\"NIS,\\" a 24-hour all-news radio network and branded \\"All News 79 WEAN.\\" When NIS folded in 1977, WEAN continued as an all-news station. Affiliation switched to CBS and while the station carried a considerable amount of CBS news content, most news originated locally, with a local news staff that numbered as high as 22 members (not all full-time, but all working for the news department.) WEAN continued as an all-news station (Newsradio 79, WEAN), morphing in the early 1980s into all-news much of the day, but with local talk in certain dayparts and syndicated late-night talk. It continued as such, branded \\"Newstalk 790, WEAN\\" until shortly after the Journal-Bulletin sold it on April 1, 1985. WEANers and Wagon WEANie Wagon After ownership changes, WEAN changed callsigns to WWAZ, with classical music, followed by oldies; then adult standards under the callsign WLKW. WLKW switched formats and callsigns in 1998 to sports as WSKO (\\"The Score\\"), airing local and national sports shows (including ESPN Radio programs), with most programs simulcast with WSKO-FM 99.7 (which was replaced by WEAN-FM, a simulcast of WPRO). The sports format was discontinued on March 10, 2008. Hosts over the years included John \\"Coach\\" Colletto, Andy Gresh, Scott Cordischi, John Rooke, Steve Hyder, Jess Atkinson, Amy Lawrence, Scott Zolak, John Crowe, and Bryan Morry. After dropping sports, the station took on its current callsign, as well as an oldies format, largely provided by Scott Shannon's The True Oldies Channel from ABC Radio; The Oldies format was discontinued on April 13, 2009. WPRV moved to a Business News and Talk format, including shows from Bloomberg Radio, although today much of the business programming has been scaled back and replaced with syndicated talk shows.

The character made his first appearance on 14 November 1989, when he arrived in the village alongside the rest of the Tate family ‚Äì his father Frank (Norman Bowler); stepmother Kim (Claire King); and younger sister Zoe (Leah Bracknell). Initially a decent man, Chris was left permanently resentful of his life after a plane crash in 1993 left him paralysed from the waist down. His storylines on the show included his numerous feuds, including one with his father Frank; a longstanding rivalry with his stepmother Kim; and his marriages with local villager Kathy Glover (Malandra Burrows), her best-friend Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay), and scheming businesswoman Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). Towards the end of his story arc, Chris learned that he had an inoperable brain tumour and used this opportunity to get revenge on Charity for cheating on him with her cousin Cain (Jeff Hordley). After wasting all of his money to ensure that Charity would be left with nothing, Chris committed suicide to frame her for his \\"murder\\" ‚Äî with the character making his final appearance on 18 September 2003 as a corpse following his death an episode earlier. Characterisation Chris was initially portrayed as a decent man, but was left permanently resentful of his life after a plane crash in 1993 left him paralyzed from the waist down. The character then became much more jaded and bitter, often using his intelligence and assets to exact revenge on those he perceived to have hurt him. Radio Times described Chris as a \\"wealthy bad boy\\" and \\"one of the most complex, conniving characters in Emmerdale history.\\" Storylines Chris first appeared in November 1989 when his father Frank and stepmother Kim bought Home Farm. He was the managing director of his father's haulage firm. He had owned a flat in Skipdale, but moved into Home Farm soon afterwards to be closer to love interest Kathy Merrick (Malandra Burrows). He had a tense relationship with his father Frank Tate (Norman Bowler), partly due to the death of Chris's mother Jean, who had died five years ago from cancer, and Frank's remarriage to his secretary Kim, who was only a few years older than Chris and had been having an affair with Frank whilst Jean was ill. Despite the turbulence between father and son, Chris was close to his younger sister, Zoe Tate. When Frank admitted he had helped Jean die when she was terminally ill, Chris initially accused Frank and Kim of plotting his mother's death. Chris was also unimpressed when Kim persuaded Frank to have an operation to reverse his vasectomy. Chris and Kathy began dating and Chris wrote a song for Kathy to sing at a village concert, 'Just This Side of Love' (which was released as a single sung by Malandra Burrows). They briefly split up over Chris's gambling habits after he lost his motorbike in a poker match to Alan Turner (Richard Thorp), but reunite and marry on 5 November 1991. The marriage began to break down a year later when Chris found out Kathy knew that Kim was having an affair with village toff Rt. Hon. Neil Kincaid (Brian Deacon). In the row that follows, Chris nearly hit Kathy, and later confides in Zoe that he is worried that he has inherited their father's temper. He also admitted that although he wanted children, Kathy didn't. When former alcoholic Frank relapses into drinking again, Chris sees an opportunity to gain control of the business by buying Kim's shares, mortgaging his and Kathy's cottage to do so, Kathy only finding out when Frank confronts her. As it turned out, Zoe joined forces with Frank to vote down Chris. Kathy, angry at his actions, begins an affair with American wine merchant Josh Lewis (Peter Warnock), and plans to leave Chris. On 30 December 1993, Chris spent the evening in Skipdale with a friend, unaware Kathy was planning to leave him that night. He was supposed to pick up Kathy and meet Zoe in the Woolpack but went straight to the pub and was there when a plane crashed into the village. Chris was trapped in the wreckage of the wine bar with his family thinking he was still in Skipdale. He was eventually discovered by Kathy's lover, Josh, and was dug out overnight. He suffered spinal injuries and was left paraplegic. Chris was very bitter about being disabled and realised that Kathy was only with him out of duty. He formed a bond with Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay), whose brother, Mark, died in the plane crash, and she began giving him swimming lessons. The friendship became an affair and Kathy found out when she saw them kissing on their third wedding anniversary. When Kathy found out Rachel was expecting Chris's child, she threw Chris out of his wheelchair. Rachel went into labour prematurely after discovering that her stepfather Joe Sugden (Frazer Hines) had died. She gave birth to a baby boy named Joseph Mark after her stepfather and brother. Chris and Rachel soon fell out with Frank over his interference with Joseph. Chris and Rachel got married on 7 December 1995 with only Jack (Clive Hornby) and Sarah Sugden (Alyson Spiro) as witnesses. The marriage lasted less than a year because of Chris's increasingly selfish and money- grabbing ways. Rachel later died, leaving Chris custody of Joseph. When Frank died of a heart attack in 1997. Chris was convinced that Kim had killed him. Kim admitted to Chris that she had watched his father die. When Chris tried to blackmail her into giving him custody of his half-brother James, Kim hit Chris over the head and tipped him out of his wheelchair, pouring whisky over him before escaping with James by helicopter. In 1999, Chris was held hostage by an employee, Liam, who revealed that he was Frank's illegitimate son and Chris's half-brother. Chris eventually formed a bond with Liam and was upset when he was shot dead by Zoe 'rescuing' Chris In 2001 Chris married for a third time, to prostitute Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). However, Zoe didn't like Charity and told Charity it was because of her history, but it soon transpired that Zoe fancied Charity herself. She offered Charity money to leave Chris and Charity responded by kissing her. The two then famously had a lesbian affair, which lasted for several months. Charity became alarmed by Zoe's obsessive behaviour and tried to end the fling, but Zoe secretly recorded Charity confessing to the affair on tape and blackmailed her into signing a prenuptial agreement, so she would always have a hold over her. Charity then confessed all to Chris, and he surprised her by forgiving her and ripping up the prenup. He later forgave Zoe after she was diagonised with Schizophrenia. In 2003 Chris discovered that Charity had had a baby when she was 13 and given it up adoption, after Emily and Paddy Kirk's 13-year-old foster child Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb) claimed she was Charity's daughter. He was shocked to discover that Debbie's father was Charity's cousin Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). In later 2003 he threw Charity out after discovering that she had been having an affair with Cain. Learning that he had an inoperable brain tumour and only months to live, Chris began frittering away all his money to ensure Charity would be left with nothing. He said a tearful goodbye to Zoe and Joseph and then arranged a meeting with Charity where he poisoned himself in order to frame his wife for his murder. He died on the floor of Home Farm in the same spot where his father had died six years previously. His last word was 'whore'. In April 2004, Charity gives birth to Chris‚Äôs son Noah Tate (Alfie Mortimer) and after Zoe does a DNA Test, Chris as revealed to be Noah's father. In 2017, Joe Tate (now Ned Porteous) returns to the village to seek revenge on Charity for his father's death. In 2018, Charity tells Noah (now Jack Downham) the truth of Chris's murder and him framing her for murder. Reception Chris' on-screen death on 18 September 2003 was watched by 10.25 million viewers.

Overview Restoration of Mazothairos They were characterized by beak-like mouthparts, and similarity, between their fore- and hindwings, and an additional pair of winglets on the prothorax, in front of the first pair of wings. They are known as \\"six-winged insects\\" because of the presence of a pair of wings on each of the thoracic segments. The mouthparts were elongated, and included sharp piercing stylets, and possibly a sucking pump-like organ. Unlike modern sucking insects, such as the Hemipterans, the mouthparts were held vertically below the head, or projected forwards. They probably used these organs to suck juices from plants, although some may have been ectoparasites, or predators. Some types attained huge size. For example, Mazothairos had a wingspan of about . Another distinctive feature was the presence of unusually long cerci, about twice the length of the abdomen. The Palaeodictyoptera are a paraphyletic assemblage of basal palaeodictyopteroidean insects, rather than a clade, because they gave rise to other insect orders. They range in time from the Middle Carboniferous (late Serpukhovian or early Bashkirian in age) to the late Permian.

Quartzite, a non-foliated metamorphic rock. Foliation in geology refers to repetitive layering in metamorphic rocks.Marshak, Stephen, Essentials of Geology, W. W. Norton 3rd Ed, 2009 Each layer can be as thin as a sheet of paper, or over a meter in thickness. The word comes from the Latin folium, meaning \\"leaf\\", and refers to the sheet-like planar structure. It is caused by shearing forces (pressures pushing different sections of the rock in different directions), or differential pressure (higher pressure from one direction than in others). The layers form parallel to the direction of the shear, or perpendicular to the direction of higher pressure. Nonfoliated metamorphic rocks are typically formed in the absence of significant differential pressure or shear. Foliation is common in rocks affected by the regional metamorphic compression typical of areas of mountain belt formation (orogenic belts). More technically, foliation is any penetrative planar fabric present in metamorphic rocks. Rocks exhibiting foliation include the standard sequence formed by the prograde metamorphism of mudrocks; slate, phyllite, schist and gneiss. The slatey cleavage typical of slate is due to the preferred orientation of microscopic phyllosilicate crystals. In gneiss, the foliation is more typically represented by compositional banding due to segregation of mineral phases. Foliated rock is also known as S-tectonite in sheared rock masses. Examples include the bands in gneiss (gneissic banding), a preferred orientation of planar large mica flakes in schist (schistosity), the preferred orientation of small mica flakes in phyllite (with its planes having a silky sheen, called phylitic luster ‚Äì the Greek word, phyllon, also means \\"leaf\\"), the extremely fine grained preferred orientation of clay flakes in slate (called \\"slaty cleavage\\"), and the layers of flattened, smeared, pancake-like clasts in metaconglomerate. Formation mechanisms Foliation is usually formed by the preferred orientation of minerals within a rock. Usually, this is a result of some physical force and its effect on the growth of minerals. The planar fabric of a foliation typically forms at right angles to the maximum principal stress direction. In sheared zones, however, planar fabric within a rock may not be directly perpendicular to the principal stress direction due to rotation, mass transport, and shortening. Foliation may be formed by realignment of micas and clays via physical rotation of the minerals within the rock. Often this foliation is associated with diagenetic metamorphism and low-grade burial metamorphism. Foliation may parallel original sedimentary bedding, but more often is oriented at some angle to it. The growth of platy minerals, typically of the mica group, is usually a result of prograde metamorphic reactions during deformation. Often, retrograde metamorphism will not form a foliation because the unroofing of a metamorphic belt is not accompanied by significant compressive stress. Thermal metamorphism in the aureole of a granite is also unlikely to result in the growth of mica in a foliation, although the growth of new minerals may overprint existing foliation(s). Alignment of tabular minerals in metamorphic rocks, igneous rocks and intrusive rocks may form a foliation. Typical examples of metamorphic rocks include porphyroblastic schists where large, oblate minerals form an alignment either due to growth or rotation in the groundmass. Igneous rocks can become foliated by alignment of cumulate crystals during convection in large magma chambers, especially ultramafic intrusions, and typically plagioclase laths. Granite may form foliation due to frictional drag on viscous magma by the wall rocks. Lavas may preserve a flow foliation, or even compressed eutaxitic texture, typically in highly viscous felsic agglomerate, welded tuff and pyroclastic surge deposits. Metamorphic differentiation, typical of gneisses, is caused by chemical and compositional banding within the metamorphic rock mass. Usually, this represents the protolith chemistry, which forms distinct mineral assemblages. However, compositional banding can be the result of nucleation processes which cause chemical and mineralogical differentiation into bands. This typically follows the same principle as mica growth, perpendicular to the principal stress. Metamorphic differentiation can be present at angles to protolith compositional banding. Crenulation cleavage and oblique foliation are particular types of foliation. Interpretation Foliation, as it forms generally perpendicular to the direction of principal stress, records the direction of shortening. This is related to the axis of folds, which generally form an axial-planar foliation within their axial regions. Measurement of the intersection between a fold's axial plane and a surface on the fold will provide the fold plunge. If a foliation does not match the observed plunge of a fold, it is likely associated with a different deformation event. Foliation in areas of shearing, and within the plane of thrust faults, can provide information on the transport direction or sense of movement on the thrust or shear. Generally, the acute intersection angle shows the direction of transport. Foliations typically bend or curve into a shear, which provides the same information, if it is of a scale which can be observed. Foliations, in a regional sense, will tend to curve around rigid, incompressible bodies such as granite. Thus, they are not always 'planar' in the strictest sense and may violate the rule of being perpendicular to the regional stress field, due to local influences. This is a megascopic version of what may occur around porphyroblasts. Often, fine observation of foliations on outcrop, hand specimen and on the microscopic scale complements observations on a map or regional scale. Description When describing a foliation it is useful to note * the mineralogy of the folia; this can provide information on the conditions of formation * the mineralogy in intrafolial areas * foliation spacing * any porphyroblasts or minerals associated with the foliation and whether they overprint it or are cut by it * whether it is planar, undulose, vague or well developed * its orientation in space, as strike and dip, or dip and dip direction * its relationship to other foliations, to bedding and any folding * measure intersection lineations Following such a methodology allows eventual correlations in style, metamorphic grade, and intensity throughout a region, relationship to faults, shears, structures and mineral assemblages. Engineering considerations In geotechnical engineering a foliation plane may form a discontinuity that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope construction.

Science fiction literature contains many positive depictions of technologically enhanced human life, occasionally set in utopian (especially techno-utopian) societies. However, science fiction's depictions of technologically enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist. The more pessimistic scenarios include many dystopian tales of human bioengineering gone wrong. Examples of \\"transhumanist fiction\\" include novels by Linda Nagata, Greg Egan, Zoltan Istvan, and Hannu Rajaniemi. Transhuman novels are often philosophical in nature, exploring the impact such technologies might have on human life. Nagata's novels, for example, explore the relationship between the natural and artificial, and suggest that while transhuman modifications of nature may be beneficial, they may also be hazardous, so should not be lightly undertaken. Egan's Diaspora explores the nature of ideas such as reproduction and questions if they make sense in a post-human context. Istvan's novel The Transhumanist Wager explores how far one person would go to achieve an indefinite lifespan via science and technology.Giulio Prisco (May 15, 2013). \\"book review  The Transhumanist Wager\\". kurzweilai.net. Rajaniemi's novel, while more action oriented, still explores themes such as death and finitude in post-human life. Fictional depictions of transhumanist scenarios are also seen in other media, such as movies (Transcendence), television series (the Ancients of Stargate SG-1), manga and anime (Ghost in the Shell), role-playing games (Rifts and Eclipse Phase) and video games (Deus Ex or BioShock). Transhumanist literature = History = Among the earliest works to portray transhumanism is the story of Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus. Victor himself is an early transhumanist character, attempting to overcome death through chemistry. The moral of the story is that man should not try to play God, serving as a criticism of the values of the transhumanist ideology that science and technology can be used to overcome the human condition. Following Mary Shelley's work, several of the stories by H.G. Wells also address this theme. The Invisible Man and The Island of Dr. Moreau both involve scientific men whose failed experiments in tampering with nature result in the story's conflict. The cyberpunk genre is heavily influenced by transhumanism, generally criticizing the use of technology to improve human life by showing the consequences resulting in its misuse. Works such as Neuromancer, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and the manga series Akira, all demonstrate worlds unbridled with technological advancement to improve the human race, used to reinforce divides among social classes. The idea of high-tech, low- life, results in rampant poverty frequently exploited by an upper-class made immortal through cybernetic enhancement. Cyberpunk as a genre attempts to caution against transhumanism by exposing the problematic elements of the social economy that supports it. =Notable transhumanist authors= * Neal Asher * Margaret Atwood * Iain M.

In the first two decades of the twenty-first century, however, there has been a surge of films and television shows focusing on the superhero genre. There are many superheroes whose stories are propelled or entirely result from dealings with transhumanism. From The Incredibles, to Iron Man, to The Batman saga, there have been plenty of heroes who did not receive their powers naturally, and therefore represent the great leap human beings may take into improving their own condition. Additionally, because these films represent the most popular trend in the medium today, they indeed represent a glimpse into the ideological shift of western culture as a whole. The fixation on normal men and women improving themselves artificially seems to have become a very widely accepted and celebrated idea. * 2001: A Space Odyssey * The 4400 * 2B * Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. * Akira * Alphas * Altered Carbon * Andromeda * Avatar * Battlestar Galactica * Beneath the Planet of the Apes * Bicentennial Man * Bio Booster Armor Guyver * Brainstorm * Caprica * Chappie * Childhood's End * Crest of the Stars * Cyborg * Dark Angel * Dark City * District 9 * Doctor Who * Elysium * Ex Machina * Fringe * Galatea 2.2 * Galaxy Express 999 * Gattaca * Ghost in the Shell * Her * Heroes * H+ (a web series) * Humans * Intersellar * Jupiter Ascending * Kamen Rider Build * The Lawnmower Man * Limitless * Lucy * The Matrix franchise * The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya * Mobile Suit Gundam * Mutant X * Neon Genesis Evangelion * Ninja Robots * Orphan Black * The Outer Limits episodes: ** \\"The Sixth Finger\\" * Pacific Rim * Powder * Prometheus * RoboCop franchise * Stargate SG-1 * Star Trek: The Original Series: **\\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" **\\"Charlie X\\" **\\"Miri\\" **\\"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\\" **\\"Space Seed\\" **\\"Metamorphosis\\" **\\"Spock's Brain\\" **\\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\" **\\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" * Star Trek: The Next Generation **\\"Hide and Q\\" **\\"The Nth Degree **\\"Q Who\\", \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" and \\"I, Borg\\" * Star Wars * Strange Days * Terminator Salvation * Texhnolyze * Transcendence * Tron franchise * Episodes of The X Files **\\"Killswitch\\" * Watchmen * X-Men * Years and Years In comics or graphic novels *Akira *Battle Angel Alita/Gunm * The webcomic Dresden Codak stars a transhuman cyborg named Kimiko Ross who augments her body over the course of the strip's stories. * The comic Transmetropolitan is about a transhuman society several centuries in the future that includes many cyborgs, uploaded humans, and genetically modified mutants. * The dystopian graphic novels Upgrade and Monkey Room by Louis Rosenberg convey satirical views on the human march towards singularity.

However unlike many transhuman or posthuman futures depicted by authors on the subject, Warhammer 40,000 is bleak, violent and filled with war and even with the existence of posthuman gods (like the Emperor of Mankind or his Primarchs) humanity is still beset on all sides by threats‚Äîincluding those of actual, supernatural gods, namely the Chaos Gods, the two Orkish deities, Gork and Mork, and their fungal offspring and the C'Tan, the star eating gods who tricked the Necrons into becoming what they are now.

The decision upheld consensual group sex and Swinging activities in a club and alleged bawdy-house as being consistent with personal autonomy and liberty. Labaye was accompanied by a sister case, R v Kouri. Background Jean‚ÄëPaul Labaye of Montreal was charged with operating a \\"common bawdy-house,\\" a violation under section 210(1) of the Criminal Code, for owning the club l'Orage, in which persons who paid membership fees and their guests could assemble and engage in group sex and oral sex and masturbate. All of these activities were consensual and, while members paid the club membership fees, the members did not pay each other in exchange for sex. Having been found guilty, Mr. Labaye was fined $2,500.CBC News, \\"Swingers clubs don't harm society, top court rules,\\" December 21, 2005, URL accessed 23 December 2005. Decision The majority of the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, held that Mr. Labaye should not have been convicted, thereby overturning the Quebec Court of Appeal. In determining whether Mr. Labaye was truly guilty of owning a bawdy- house, the Court had to decide whether the activities taking place within should be classified as indecent, since bawdy-houses are, by definition, houses in which prostitution or indecency occurs or is planned to occur. The Court first noted that morality was of no use to determining whether these activities were indecent. Only the objective standards of decency established in Canadian law would be of use, and those standards were concerned with whether any harm has been done. In reviewing precedent, which included Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen (1985) and R. v. Butler (1992), the Court noted that it has been established, first in the 1985 case, that \\"obscenity\\" is defined as exceeding what Canadians would be able to socially accept (although there are some things that certain Canadians will not like but nevertheless will accept). Moreover, the obscenity must be harmful to certain people. In R. v. Butler and Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice), it was further established that whether something harms or threatens to harm to certain people is important to determining whether something is indecent, and indeed harm became the only measure of indecency in Canadian law. (The dissent disputed this point, arguing that only now, with this decision, had harm become the only measure.) At any rate, in R. v. Labaye, the Court approved of the harm-only approach and wrote that \\"Harm or significant risk of harm is easier to prove than a community standard\\" of decency. The Court went on to establish more guidelines as to how to measure harm. First, the Court wrote that what is indecent under the Criminal Code is what is contrary to principles in constitutional or other important laws. The whole of society has beliefs on what it needs to operate; the beliefs of individuals or certain political beliefs that something might be harmful is, in contrast, not enough. Moreover, the harm in indecency must be serious. The Court explored these definitions in depth, noting that values that can be said to be essential to society include liberty and equality. Freedom of religion, another key Canadian value, indicates that no particular religion will shape the definition of indecency. Hence, indecency in Canadian law is something that threatens someone's liberty, exposes something undesirable to people, forces someone to commit a misdeed (this includes material \\"depraving and corrupting susceptible people\\" and \\"material that perpetuates negative and demeaning images\\"), or harms someone engaging in certain acts. In examining the question of what cases in which people are exposed to things they do not want to see can be considered indecent, the Court was mindful that sex is a more open subject in society, but nevertheless \\"there may be some kinds of sexual conduct the public display of which seriously impairs the livability of the environment and significantly constrains autonomy.\\" This was especially important to the law at the basis of R. v. Labaye. It was concluded that in this particular case, Mr. Labaye was not guilty of indecency because of the actions he took to make sure only willing people would see the sexual conduct. In considering the issue of whether the harm is serious, the Court wrote that \\"The threshold is high\\"; certain things that certain Canadians will not like should be allowed to exist, unless it becomes so serious it threatens the society. While the measurement of the seriousness of the indecency would involve some \\"value judgements,\\" the Court wrote that some objective guides could be provided by avoiding unwritten values, and by considering circumstances. In cases where the indecency is of a kind where people are exposed to undesirable things, an accused would be guilty if there is \\"a real risk that the way people live will be significantly and adversely affected by the conduct.\\" Consent to see the activity will not amount to harm or indecency. In this particular case, the Court found that the seriousness of the harm need not even be considered because no evidence of harm was found, and even so \\"there appears to be no evidence that the degree of alleged harm rose to the level of incompatibility with the proper functioning of society. Consensual conduct behind code-locked doors can hardly be supposed to jeopardize a society as vigorous and tolerant as Canadian society.\\" The Court added the case was different from R. v. Butler because nothing was involved that encouraged sexist attitudes. \\"There is no evidence of anti-social attitudes toward women,\\" the Court wrote, \\"or for that matter men.\\" This was because all of the sex was consensual and not prostitution. Nor was the threat of sexually transmitted diseases enough to constitute harm in relation to the specific charge of indecency. This is because these diseases are more of a health issue than a harm that comes exclusively from deviant sex. Dissent A lengthy dissent was written by Justices Michel Bastarache and Louis LeBel. The dissenting justices criticized the majority's definition of indecency as \\"neither desirable nor workable,\\" since it did not follow certain precedent and discarded the \\"contextual analysis of the Canadian community standard of tolerance\\". While harm is an important consideration, that does not mean Canadians would be able to accept certain sexual conduct. Standards can be drawn upon \\"principles of social morality drawn from legislation.\\" Moreover, the importance given to harm in R. v. Butler was \\"adopted to fill a vacuum,\\" to connect past case law regarding community standards to views that some material encourages sexist attitudes, and \\"it does not follow from Butler, Tremblay and Mara that the courts must determine what the community tolerates by reference to the degree of harm alone.\\" In this particular case, the dissenting justices believed that the screening out of people who did not want to see the sexual conduct was not rigorous enough, and that \\"The community does not tolerate the performance of acts of this nature in a place of business to which the public has easy access.\\" See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (McLachlin Court) References External links CBC news story Supreme Court of Canada cases 2005 in Canadian case law Canadian criminal case law ","title":"R v Labaye"},{"id":"3506533","text":"The United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) unites the three main political independence movements seeking independence for Western New Guinea (West Papua) under a single umbrella organisation. The ULMWP was formed on 7 December 2014 in Vanuatu uniting the Federal Republic of West Papua (NRFPB), the West Papua National Coalition for Liberation (WPNCL) and the National Parliament of West Papua (NPWP). History In October 2013, the West Papua National Council for Liberation made an unsuccessful application to join the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG). Indonesia had earlier been granted observer status in 2011 for Papua (province) and West Papua (province). The MSG advised that West Papua independence organisations must first unite for any future applications to be considered. In December 2014, all West Papuan independence movement groups united under a single umbrella organisation, the United Liberation Movement for West Papua in Vanuatu. In February 2015, Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa according to Benny Wenda, stated he was shocked that West Papua is still not free. In 2004, the Bishop had asked the UN to review the Act of Free Choice. In June 2015, the ULMWP was granted MSG observer status as representative of West Papuans outside the country while Indonesia was upgraded to associate member. In September 2016, at the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly, the Prime Ministers of Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Presidents of Nauru and Marshall Islands, called for UN action on alleged human rights abuses committed on West Papua's indigenous Melanesians. The Solomon Islands stated that human rights abuses were linked to the pursuit for independence, and Tuvalu raised autonomy. Indonesia responded that the allegations were false and fabricated. The Solomon Islands said that Indonesia should give UN special rapporteurs access to West Papua to prove allegations were false. In October, the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination initiated an early warning and urgent action procedure, and requested Indonesia to formally respond to allegations of racial violence by mid-November, where Indonesia never responded to the UN hearing. 261x261px In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands raising human rights abuses and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report. Indonesia replied that it rejected Vanuatu's allegations. Also, a joint NGO statement was made raising the depopulation of indigenous West Papuans and health and medical services especially in remote areas. Indonesia replied that the allegation of depopulation of Papuan community is simply baseless. In May 2017, at the Council of Ministers of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) a joint statement by Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau, and the Marshall Islands raised human rights abuses which were described as slow-motion genocide and called for a resolution to support self- determination. Papua New Guinea suggested a fact-finding mission. Guinea- Bissau compared the plight of West Papua to East Timor. In May 2017, eleven New Zealand parliamentarians from four political parties signed the Westminster Declaration, which calls for West Papua‚Äôs right to self- determination to be legally recognised through an internationally supervised vote. In September 2017, at the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, the Prime Ministers of the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu once again raised human rights concerns and the Caribbean nation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Vanuatu called for a Human Rights Council investigation into killings and human rights abuses by Indonesian security forces and appealed to world leaders to support self-determination with the Solomon Islands also calling for self-determination. Indonesia denied all the allegations and stated that West Papua would remain part of Indonesia. On 26 September 2017, ULMWP spokesperson Benny Wenda claimed that at the United Nations General Assembly he presented a secret petition for self-determination signed by 1.8 million West Papuans to the Special Committee on Decolonization. The Chair of the Special Committee on Decolonisation, Rafael Ram√≠rez, subsequently responded that he had not received a petition and even if one was presented it would be outside the mandate of the committee. Ram√≠rez said that the committee accepts Indonesia's sovereignty over West Papua and that his office had been \\"manipulated\\" for political purposes. On 1 December 2017, Benny Wenda was elected Chairman of the ULMWP following an organisational restructure. Jacob Rumbiak now serves as the International Spokesperson. Organisational structure =National Parliament of West Papua= The National Parliament of West Papua (PNWP) incorporates the National Committee for West Papua (KNPB). =West Papua National Coalition for Liberation= The West Papua National Coalition for Liberation (WPNCL) is a group for organisations seeking independence that was formed on 20 December 2005. Its Secretary General is Rex Rumakiek. The Coalition aims to raise the issue of West Papua in Oceania's regional organisations. It is seeking observer status for West Papua at the Melanesian Spearhead Group, which it was granted in 2015, and has announced it would request the Papua New Guinean government to bring up the question of West Papua at the Pacific Islands Forum.  International support  Unlicensed graffiti in Vanuatu advocating for the liberation of West Papua Vanuatu has been an advocate for the liberation of West Papua. The 11th Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Charlot Salwai, spoke 'in support of West Papuan human rights and self-determination'. Various other pacific leaders also provided their support at the United Nations. International non-governmental actors have also demonstrated their belief in the cause. The political graffiti to the right reflects the continued efforts by Vanuatu citizens in advocating for the liberation of West Papua. Indonesia has criticised Vanuatu for undermining Indonesian sovereignty, but it has not fettered their ongoing political and cultural support.

The Esan are traditionally agriculturalists, trado- medical practitioners, mercenary warriors and hunters. They cultivate palm trees, Irvingia gabonensis (erhonhiele), Cherry (Otien), bell pepper (akoh) coconut, betel nut, kola nut, black pear, avocado pear, yams, cocoyam, cassava, maize, rice, beans, groundnut, bananas, oranges, plantains, sugar cane, tomato, potato, okra, pineapple, paw paw, and various vegetables. The modern Esan nation is believed to have been organized during the 15th century, when citizens, mostly nobles and princes, left the neighbouring Benin Empire for the northeast; there they formed communities and kingdoms called among the aboriginal peoples whom they met there. There are on the whole 35 established kingdoms in Esanland, including Amahor, Ebelle, Egoro, Ewohimi, Ekekhenlen, Ekpoma, Ekpon, Emu, Ewu, Ewatto, Ewossa, Idoa, Ifeku, Igueben, Ilushi, Inyelen, Irrua, Ogwa, Ohordua, Okalo, Okhuesan, Onogholo, Opoji, Oria, Orowa, Uromi, Udo, Ugbegun, Ugboha, Ubiaja, Urhohi, Ugun, Ujiogba, Ukhun, and Uzea.

However, these kingdoms were colonized, along with the Benin Empire, by the British Empire during September 1897, only gaining independence 63 years later in 1960 when Nigeria became independent from British Colonial rule. After independence, the Esan people have suffered from civil war, poverty, and lack of infrastructure.

Retrieved on 1 November 2014. and there is a strong Esan diaspora. Etymology and identity The term Esan has been applied to the Esan people for thousands of years, and was used before contact with Europeans. It is believed by many historians that the name 'Esan' (originally, 'E san fia') owes its origin to Bini (meaning, 'they have fled' or 'they jumped away'). 'Ishan' is an Anglicized form of 'Esan', the result of colonial Britain's inability to properly pronounce the name of this ethnic group. It is believed that similar corruption has affected such Esan names as ubh·∫πkh·∫π (now 'obeche' tree), uloko (now 'iroko' tree), Abhuluim·∫πn (now 'Aburime'), etc. Efforts have however been made to return to status quo ante. For academic purpose, Esan refers to # the ethnic group that occupies central Edo State; # (plural unchanged) a person or the people collectively from this ethnic group; # the language of these people which, linguistically, is of the Kwa subdivision of the Niger-Congo language family; # something of, related to, or having Esan origin e.g. uro Esan (=Esan language), ot·ªç Esan (=Esan land), ·ªçgh·∫πd·∫π Esan (=Esan banana). In the pre-colonial era, Esans carried a crow's foot tribal scar below their eyes. History =Pre-historical/classical period= According to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah-forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years ago. These people were likely associated with the Nok people and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests. To this day, northern Esan dialects have more in common with Northern Edo languages such as Etsako and Owan than southern Esan dialects do, which happen to be closely related with Edo. These \\"proto-Edoid\\" peoples grew yam, oil palm and vegetables, but also hunted and gathered. Starting from 500 AD to 750 AD, these hunter-gatherers started to colonize the savannah-forest ecosystem of Esanland and the forest ecosystem of the Benin Empire. They created a pre-Esan, pre-Edo society that built advanced structures such as moats and walls around family properties. These enclosures were, at maximum, three to five kilometers in diameter, and demarcated residential and agricultural property. Those properties enlarged to become villages, and by 800 AD, these village coalesced to form kingdoms with hierarchies. Modern-day digs in the region have found that these walls were situated in the eastern Benin Empire and northern Esanland. Settlements were close to permanent springs on the northern plateau, but never next to intermittent springs. Esanland‚Äôs culture, language and growth were majorly influenced by the mass exoduses to Esan territory from all adjacent polities Communities on Esanland‚Äôs southern and eastern fringes (Ewohimi, Ewatto, Ekpon, Amahor) were heavily populated by Igbos and Igalas (into Uroh); from the north came the Emai into Ukhun, Idoa, and Amahor and the Etsako into Irrua); and from the south came the Itsekiri (into Ekpon) and Urhobo (into Ujiogba). The biggest influence on Esanland came from Edo, founders of Benin Empire. In 1460, Oba Ewuare passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking. These laws proved too restrictive for many citizens, and these citizens fled the kingdom to Esanland. This exodus shaped Esanland‚Äôs modern cultural identity and gave rise to the term \\"Esan,\\" or \\"refugee.\\" Oral tradition has heavily supported this theory. Prominent Esan and Edo historians have collected stories about this migration. = Pre-colonization = Esan kingdoms had a varying degree of autonomy, but were ultimately controlled by the Benin Empire. The Oba approved the of Esanland, and Esan kingdoms paid tribute to Benin. Yet, several wars between Esan kingdoms and Benin were recorded. This was due to the Oba, at ascension on the throne, sending white chalk to the Esans as a term of friendship. If the chalk was rejected, then the Oba would try to invade Esanland. The varying political stabilities of Benin and the Esan kingdoms also led to warfare. Such warfare was so common that there is no recorded history of peace between all of the Esan kingdoms and Benin. Esanland was extensively involved in world trade. Benin‚Äôs sovereignty over Esanland enabled it to send long-distant traders, or Ekhen procured cloth, ivory, peppers, and slaves for European merchants in Yorubaland, Esanland, and Afenmai. Portugal primarily received blue cloth, or from Esanland in exchange for tobacco, brandy, mirror, beads, and firearms, primarily through . During the 16th century, the Uzea War occurred. This war was between the Uromi Kingdom and the Benin Kingdom. The war lasted from 1502 to 1503, and resulted from a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba of Uromi. The war ended at the town of Uzea, when both leaders were killed. However, in peaceful times Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and the sacking of Akure in 1823. During the nineteenth century, northern Esanland was continually attacked and sacked by the Muslim Nupe people in the hunt for slaves and converts to Islam, having previously taken over the Kukuruku peoples‚Äô lands. Many Esan kingdoms from the south helped in the battle to fend off the Nupes. The battles came into the Esans‚Äô favor; several Nupe and Etsako warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. The nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products. = Esan warfare and colonization = Prince Okojie and his entourage. In 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland proved to be harder to conquer than the Benin Kingdom because of its strong autonomy: Kingdoms chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue. The first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a guerrilla warfare strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901. On March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by Prince Okojie, was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar. This process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued guerilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain‚Äôs part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division. agogo bell. The agogo is a very important instrument in Esanland. It is used to help keep of the rhythm of the region's various dances, and the translation of hour in Esan is agogo. =Performing arts/music= Esan dance is dominated by the Igbabonelimhin, an acrobatic dance performed mostly by young males. Igbabonelimhin involves spinning and somersaulting to a timed beat. This dance was mostly performed at New Year's. Today, the dance is taken as a unique symbol for Esans everywhere.

(Dr.) Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, former President of the United Nations Human Rights Council Religion and folklore Esan folktales and folklore, like the igbabon·∫πlimhin and akhu·∫π, serve as forms of learning and entertainment. The Esan have prominent traditional rulers who keep order in a society where beauty and manners are intertwined. Despite the long-term impact of Christianity, the Esan are largely traditional and a large number practice traditional beliefs in the form of worship of ancestral spirits and other gods. A large percentage of Esan are Christians, mostly Catholic and recently of other denominations. Esan has various dialects all of which stem from Bini and there is still close affinity between the Esan and the Bini, which leads to the common saying \\"Esan ii gbi ·∫∏do\\" meaning, Esan does not harm the ·∫∏do (i.e. Bini). There have been other translation of that saying, Esan gbe Edo which means Esan have conquered Bini. Traditional Esan religion has many similarities to traditional Edo religion, due to the Esan migration to the northeast during the 15th century from the Benin Empire. There are many deities of the Esan religion: * Osanobua, the main Edo-Esan god. This name for God was brought over to Christianity and its missionaries, and thus the translation for God in Esanland is Osanobua. * Olokun * Esu, the Esan trickster god. This god is shared with Yoruba and Edo myth. The name Esu was used as a translation for Satan by Christian missionaries. * Osun, the Esan god of medicine. This is where the surname Okosun, or son of medicine, originated from.

The Laplace expansion is of didactic interest for its simplicity and as one of several ways to view and compute the determinant. For large matrices, it quickly becomes inefficient to compute when compared to methods using matrix decomposition. Calculation of the determinant by Laplace expansion utilizes the cofactor and the minor. The i, j cofactor of the matrix B is the scalar Cij defined by :C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij},, where Mij is the i, j minor of B, that is, the determinant of the (n ‚àí 1) √ó (n ‚àí 1) matrix that results from deleting the i-th row and the j-th column of B. Then the Laplace expansion is given by the following :Theorem. Suppose B = [b_{ij}] is an ntimes n matrix and choose any fixed i,j in { 1,2... n }. Suppose i^{'} is a fixed choice of iin {1,2... n }. Then its determinant leftBright = det(B) is given by: : begin{align} det(B) &= left[(-1)^{i^{'}+1} b_{i^{'}1} det(M_{i^{'}1})right] +left[ (-1)^{i^{'}+2} b_{i^{'}2} det(M_{i^{'}2})right] cdots +left[ (-1)^{i^{'}+n} b_{1n} det(M_{i^{'}n})right]  &= sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^{i^{'}+j} b_{i^{'}j} det(M_{i^{'}j})  end{align} :where det(M_{ij}) is the minor of element B_{ij}, i.e. the determinant of the submatrix M_{ij} formed by removing the i^{th} row and the j^{th} column of matrix B.  Examples  Consider the matrix : B = begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3  4 & 5 & 6  7 & 8 & 9 end{bmatrix}. The determinant of this matrix can be computed by using the Laplace expansion along any one of its rows or columns. For instance, an expansion along the first row yields: : begin{align} B & = 1 cdot begin{vmatrix} 5 & 6  8 & 9 end{vmatrix} - 2 cdot begin{vmatrix} 4 & 6  7 & 9 end{vmatrix} + 3 cdot begin{vmatrix} 4 & 5  7 & 8 end{vmatrix} [5pt] & = 1 cdot (-3) - 2 cdot (-6) + 3 cdot (-3) = 0. end{align} Laplace expansion along the second column yields the same result: : begin{align} B & = -2 cdot begin{vmatrix} 4 & 6  7 & 9 end{vmatrix} + 5 cdot begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3  7 & 9 end{vmatrix} - 8 cdot begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3  4 & 6 end{vmatrix} [5pt] & = -2 cdot (-6) + 5 cdot (-12) - 8 cdot (-6) = 0. end{align} It is easy to verify that the result is correct: the matrix is singular because the sum of its first and third column is twice the second column, and hence its determinant is zero. Proof Suppose B is an n √ó n matrix and i,jin{1,2,dots,n}. For clarity we also label the entries of B that compose its i,j minor matrix M_{ij} as (a_{st}) for 1 le s,t le n-1. Consider the terms in the expansion of B that have b_{ij} as a factor. Each has the form : sgn tau,b_{1,tau(1)} cdots b_{i,j} cdots b_{n,tau(n)} = sgn tau,b_{ij} a_{1,sigma(1)} cdots a_{n-1,sigma(n-1)} for some permutation with tau(i)=j, and a unique and evidently related permutation sigmain S_{n-1} which selects the same minor entries as . Similarly each choice of determines a corresponding i.e. the correspondence sigmaleftrightarrowtau is a bijection between S_{n-1} and {tauin S_ncolontau(i)=j}. The explicit relation between tau and sigma can be written as : sigma = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & cdots & i & cdots & n-1  tau(1) (leftarrow)_j & tau(2) (leftarrow)_j & cdots & tau(i+1)(leftarrow)_j & cdots & tau(n) (leftarrow)_j end{pmatrix} where (leftarrow)_j is a temporary shorthand notation for a cycle (n,n-1,cdots,j+1,j). This operation decrements all indices larger than j so that every index fit in the set {1,2,...,n-1} The permutation can be derived from as follows. Define sigma'in S_n by sigma'(k) = sigma(k) for 1 le k le n-1 and sigma'(n) = n. Then sigma' is expressed as : sigma' = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & cdots & i & cdots & n-1 & n  tau(1) (leftarrow)_j & tau(2) (leftarrow)_j & cdots & tau(i+1) (leftarrow)_j & cdots & tau(n) (leftarrow)_j & nend{pmatrix} Now, the operation which apply (leftarrow)_i first and then apply sigma' is (Notice applying A before B is equivalent to applying inverse of A to the upper row of B in Cauchy's two-line notation ) : sigma' (leftarrow)_i = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & cdots & i+1 & cdots & n & i  tau(1) (leftarrow)_j & tau(2) (leftarrow)_j & cdots & tau(i+1) (leftarrow)_j & cdots & tau(n) (leftarrow)_j & nend{pmatrix} where (leftarrow)_i is temporary shorthand notation for (n,n-1,cdots,i+1,i). the operation which apply tau first and then apply (leftarrow)_j is : (leftarrow)_j tau = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & cdots & i & cdots & n-1 & n  tau(1) (leftarrow)_j & tau(2) (leftarrow)_j & cdots & n & cdots & tau(n-1) (leftarrow)_j & tau(n) (leftarrow)_jend{pmatrix} above two are equal thus, : (leftarrow)_j tau = sigma' (leftarrow)_i : tau = (rightarrow)_j sigma' (leftarrow)_i where (rightarrow)_j is the inverse of (leftarrow)_j which is (j,j+1,cdots,n). Thus : tau,=(j,j+1,ldots,n)sigma'(n,n-1,ldots,i) Since the two cycles can be written respectively as n-i and n-j transpositions, : sgntau,= (-1)^{2n-(i+j)} sgnsigma',= (-1)^{i+j} sgnsigma. And since the map sigmaleftrightarrowtau is bijective, :begin{align} sum_{tau in S_n:tau(i)=j} sgn tau,b_{1,tau(1)} cdots b_{n,tau(n)} &= sum_{i=1}^{n}sum_{sigma in S_{n-1}} (-1)^{i+j}sgnsigma, b_{ij} a_{1,sigma(1)} cdots a_{n-1,sigma(n-1)} &= sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{ij}(-1)^{i+j} sum_{sigma in S_{n-1}} sgnsigma, a_{1,sigma(1)} cdots a_{n-1,sigma(n-1)} &= sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{ij} (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij} end{align} from which the result follows. Similarly, the result holds if the index of the outer summation was replaced with j. Laplace expansion of a determinant by complementary minors Laplaces cofactor expansion can be generalised as follows. = Example = Consider the matrix : A = begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  5 & 6 & 7 & 8  9 & 10 & 11 & 12  13 & 14 & 15 & 16 end{bmatrix}. The determinant of this matrix can be computed by using the Laplace's cofactor expansion along the first two rows as follows. Firstly note that there are 6 sets of two distinct numbers in namely let S=left{{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{2,3},{2,4},{3,4}right} be the aforementioned set. By defining the complementary cofactors to be : b_{{j,k}}=begin{vmatrix} a_{1j} & a_{1k}  a_{2j} & a_{2k} end{vmatrix}, : c_{{p,q}}=begin{vmatrix} a_{3p} & a_{3q}  a_{4p} & a_{4q} end{vmatrix}, and the sign of their permutation to be : varepsilon^{{j,k},{p,q}}=mbox{sgn}begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  j & k & p & q end{bmatrix}, text{ where } p eq j,q eq k. The determinant of A can be written out as : A = sum_{H in S} varepsilon^{H,H^prime}b_{H}c_{H^prime}, where H^{prime} is the complementary set to H . In our explicit example this gives us :begin{align} A &= b_{{1,2}}c_{{3,4}} -b_{{1,3}}c_{{2,4}} +b_{{1,4}}c_{{2,3}}+b_{{2,3}}c_{{1,4}} -b_{{2,4}}c_{{1,3}} +b_{{3,4}}c_{{1,2}} [5pt] &= begin{vmatrix} 1 & 2  5 & 6 end{vmatrix} cdot begin{vmatrix} 11 & 12  15 & 16 end{vmatrix} - begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3  5 & 7 end{vmatrix} cdot begin{vmatrix} 10 & 12  14 & 16 end{vmatrix} + begin{vmatrix} 1 & 4  5 & 8 end{vmatrix} cdot begin{vmatrix} 10 & 11  14 & 15 end{vmatrix} + begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3  6 & 7 end{vmatrix} cdot begin{vmatrix} 9 & 12  13 & 16 end{vmatrix} - begin{vmatrix} 2 & 4  6 & 8 end{vmatrix} cdot begin{vmatrix} 9 & 11  13 & 15 end{vmatrix} + begin{vmatrix} 3 & 4  7 & 8 end{vmatrix} cdot begin{vmatrix} 9 & 10  13 & 14 end{vmatrix}[5pt] &= -4 cdot (-4) -(-8) cdot (-8) +(-12) cdot (-4) +(-4) cdot (-12) -(-8) cdot (-8) +(-4) cdot (-4)[5pt] &= 16 - 64 + 48 + 48 - 64 + 16 = 0. end{align} As above, it is easy to verify that the result is correct: the matrix is singular because the sum of its first and third column is twice the second column, and hence its determinant is zero. = General statement = Let B=[b_{ij}] be an matrix and S the set of -element subsets of , H an element in it. Then the determinant of B can be expanded along the rows identified by H as follows: :B = sum_{Lin S} varepsilon^{H,L} b_{H,L} c_{H,L} where varepsilon^{H,L} is the sign of the permutation determined by H and L, equal to (-1)^{left(sum_{hin H}hright) + left(sum_{ellin L}ellright)}, b_{H,L} the square minor of B obtained by deleting from B rows and columns with indices in H and L respectively, and c_{H,L} (called the complement of b_{H,L}) defined to be b_{H',L'} , H' and L' being the complement of H and L respectively. This coincides with the theorem above when k=1. The same thing holds for any fixed columns. Computational expense The Laplace expansion is computationally inefficient for high dimension matrices, with a time complexity in big O notation of O(n!). Alternatively, using a decomposition into triangular matrices as in the LU decomposition can yield determinants with a time complexity of O(n^3).Stoer Bulirsch: Introduction to Numerical Mathematics The following Python code implements Laplace expansion recursively: def determinant(M): # Base case of recursive function: 2x2 matrix (such that det(M) = ad - cb) if len(M)  2: return (M[0][0] * M[1][1]) - (M[0][1] * M[1][0]) else: total = 0 for column, element in enumerate(M[0]): # Exclude first row and current column.

Huexotzinco, (Way- hoat-ZINC-o) is a town southeast of Mexico City, in the state of Puebla. In 1521, the Nahua Indian people of the town were the allies of the Spanish conqueror Hern√°n Cort√©s, and together they confronted their enemies to overcome Moctezuma, leader of the Aztec Empire. Cort√©s's indigenous allies from Tlaxcala were more successful than those Huejotzinco in translating that alliance into privileges in the colonial era and the Huejotzincan's petitioned the crown for such privileges. A 1560 petition to the crown in Nahuatl outlines their participation.James Lockhart, \\"Letter of the Cabildo [town council] of Huejotzinco to the King, 1560,\\" in We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico, James Lockhart, editor and translator, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993, pp. 288-297. After the conquest, the Huexotzinco peoples became part of Cort√©s's encomienda holdings. While Cort√©s was out of Mexico from 1529 to 1530, the First Audiencia sought to strip Cort√©s of his intervened in the daily activities of the community and forced the Nahuas to pay excessive taxes in the form of goods and services. When Cort√©s returned, the Nahuas of Huejotzinco joined him in a legal case against the abuses of the First Audiencia. The Huexotzinco Codex has testimony enumerating the abuses by Nu√±o de Guzm√°n when he took over the encomienda in the name of the crown. Indigenous supporting Cort√©s's lawsuit claimed that Guzm√°n extracted large amounts of tributes from the town, but also that they were compelled to serve Guzm√°n as he went to war. Several indigenous witnesses testified to the fact that the lord of Huextzinco was compelled to participate, but that until a horse was procured for him he refused to serve. At this time horses were very expensive, since they were not native to the New World and at the end of the 1520s likely there were few born locally. The horse, according to the testimony of one Esteban, previously named Tochel (or Tochtli, \\"rabbit\\"), cost \\"twenty-one small gold ingots.\\" Esteban also says that for the 600 men outfitted for war, the cost was 27,000 pieces of cloth.\\"Huejotzinco Codex,\\" in The Harkness Collection in the Library of Congress, J.

This Agiulf has sometimes been identified with Aioulf.Thompson, \\"The Suevic Kingdom of Galicia,\\" 298 n40. According to the local and contemporary chronicler Hydatius, after the sack of Braga and the execution of Rechiar, the previous Suevic king, by the Visigoths, the Gothic king, Theodoric II, led his army south into Lusitania while one of his commanders, Aioulf, deserted him and remained behind in Galicia hoping to make himself king of the Sueves there.Thompson, \\"The Suevic Kingdom of Galicia,\\" 168. However, the later, Pannonian historian Jordanes records that Aioulf was a Warnic cliens (retainer) of Theodoric appointed by the king to administer the Suevi and who, being provoked by the Suevi themselves, sought to make himself king but was defeated by Theodoric's army in the first engagement, captured, and executed. According to E. A. Thompson, Jordanes is less reliable than Hydatius for three reasons: he lived further away both in time and space from events in Galicia, his record for accuracy is less reputable, and his bias for the Goths led him to make the disloyal Aioulf a Warni and to involve the Suevi themselves in the act of betraying Theodoric. More significantly, however, Jordanes mentions the Suevic bishops being greeted by Theodoric \\"with the reverence due to episcopal rank (pontificali reverentia)\\", an anachronism considering the Suevi were pagans in 457.Thompson, \\"The Suevic Kingdom of Galicia,\\" 169.

During his four season at Virginia, the Cavaliers took the NCAA title twice (1991 and 1992) and were co-champions once (1989). In 1992, he was the team captain as a senior. Imler was a two-time second-team All-American. While at Virginia, he majored in sports medicine. In 2000, SoccerAmerica magazine named Imler to its College Team of the Century. Professional In 1994, Imler played for the Delaware Wizards of USISL. In 1995, he moved to the Raleigh Flyers. In February 1996, D.C. United of Major League Soccer (MLS) drafted Imler in the third round (30th overall) in the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. He spent the 1996 season in central defense with United, playing in nineteen games as the team took both the 1996 MLS Cup and 1996 U.S. Open Cup titles. United released Imler in 1997 and he signed with the Worcester Wildfire of USISL. At the same time, he pursued a return to MLS and had a two- week try out with the New England Revolution. On May 7, 1997, the Revs signed Imler as a Discovery Player after impressing the coaches during his trial. The Revs waived Imler on November 10, 1997. In 1998, he signed with the Charleston Battery, but tore his anterior cruciate ligament during a pre-season game which led to his losing the entire 1998 season.Battery Plagued by Injuries In 1999, Imler played one game, twelve minutes total, for the Charleston Battery.Player register The Battery then released him and he finished the season, and his career, with the Lehigh Valley Steam. National and Olympic teams Imler was a member of the U.S. team at the 1987 U-16 World Cup in Canada. He then went on to play with the U.S. U-20 national team, but was not a member of the team at any cups. In 1991, Imler was part of the U.S. gold winning soccer team at the Pan American Games. He then continued to play for the U-23 national team leading up to the 1992 Summer Olympics. Imler started all six games as the U.S. qualified for the tournament. He was then named to the U.S. soccer team for the games. At the Olympics, the U.S. went 1-1-1 and did not qualify for the second round. On March 23, 1993, Imler earned his only caps with the U.S. national team in a 2-2 tie with El Salvador. However, in the 43d minute, he tore ligaments in his right knee during the game and was replaced by Yari Allnutt who scored a goal. Imler never appeared again for the senior national team.

The series takes place in \\"The Box\\", a playhouse made entirely of cardboard boxes, where two hosts, Tony James and Vivian Bayubay McLaughlin, make crafts, sing songs, and act out plays. Two special episodes were released on VHS by Walt Disney Home Video, Out of the Box: Trick or Treat, and Out of the Box: Happy Holidays. Trick or Treat is also available on the DVD entitled Rolie Polie Olie: A Spookie Ookie Halloween. The series was created and executive produced by Douglas Love and was based on his series of books from HarperCollins. Three seasons were filmed at Lifetime Studios in New York City. The series earned three Parents' Choice Awards for excellence in television and an Emmy nomination. The show was believed to be lost due to the lack of home-video releases. This rumor was discredited when the entire series became available to stream on Disney+ on November 12, 2019. Overview Every day, a small group of neighborhood children come and play in \\"The Box\\", an imaginary clubhouse made entirely out of painted cardboard boxes. Tony James and Vivian Bayubay McLaughlin play games, do crafts, sing songs, and act out stories in the box. The singing is usually in the beginning of the episode, while the crafts are in the middle, and the stories are at the ending. The show ends with either Tony or Vivian walking the kids home, then coming back to sing the Goodbye Song. The song is either sung a cappella by Vivian and with Tony tapping on a pumpkin or some other object, but in three episodes Tony plays it on his guitar In two episodes the kids join in to the Goodbye song after they finished they wave to the viewers and the camera would move out as a piano ending of the goodbye song plays in one episode Vivian told the viewers that she will tell Tony they are thinking of him.

In the U.S. state of New York, I-95 extends from the George Washington Bridge in New York City to the Connecticut state line at Port Chester. From the George Washington Bridge, which carries I-95 across the Hudson River from New Jersey into New York City, it runs across upper Manhattan on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway and continues east across the Harlem River on the Alexander Hamilton Bridge and onto the Cross Bronx Expressway. In the Bronx, I-95 leaves the Cross Bronx at the Bruckner Interchange, joining the Bruckner Expressway to its end. North of the interchange with Pelham Parkway, it then continues northeast via the New England Thruway (which is part of the New York State Thruway system) out of New York City into Westchester County and to the Connecticut state line, where I-95 continues on the Connecticut Turnpike. Route description =Manhattan= I-95 enters New York from New Jersey on the George Washington Bridge on a concurrency with U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and US 9. As the bridge's eastern approach enters Fort Washington Park, I-95 enters exit 1, which services New York State Route 9A (NY 9A, the Henry Hudson Parkway). Access is also provided to 181st Street. After crossing Fort Washington Avenue, the interstate goes underground, providing a ramp to 178th Street, which is where US 9 forks to Broadway. I-95 continues east under Washington Heights, entering an interchange with the Harlem River Drive along with Amsterdam Avenue. =The Bronx= After exit 2, I-95 crosses over the Harlem River and enters the Bronx, entering an interchange with the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87), which is marked both exit 1C (following with the Cross Bronx Expressway) and exit 3A B (matching with the Trans-Manhattan Expressway). Now the Cross-Bronx Expressway, I-95 and US 1 continue east over University Avenue and enter exit 2A, which serves Jerome Avenue. Crossing over the Grand Concourse, the six-lane expressway crosses into exit 2B, which is for Webster Avenue. This interchange also marks the eastern end of the I-95/US 1 concurrency. Passing south of Tremont Park, the Cross Bronx westbound serves exit 3, which serves Third Avenue. Congestion on the Cross Bronx Expressway westbound approaching exit 4B At East 176th Street, the Cross Bronx Expressway turns southeast, entering exit 4A eastbound, which marks the northern terminus of NY 895 (Sheridan Boulevard). After crossing the Bronx River, the expressway enters a full interchange, exit 4B, with the Bronx River Parkway. After a curve from the parkway, the Cross Bronx begins paralleling East 177th Street and enters exit 5A, which connects to White Plains Road in Parkchester. Continuing southeast, the roadway enters exit 5B, Castle Hill Avenue, which is an eastbound-only exit. After Castle Hill Avenue, the route enters exit 6A, which reaches the Hutchinson River Parkway at the Bruckner Interchange. Changing to the Bruckner Expressway, which runs to the northeast, I-95 enters the Bruckner Interchange with the northern termini of I-678 and I-278; the Cross Bronx Expressway Extension turns southeast along I-295 at the same interchange. After the Bruckner Interchange, I-95 crosses Tremont Avenue before crossing over I-695 (the Throgs Neck Expressway). Southbound, exit 7A serves I-695, while northbound the two interstates merge. Continuing north, the Bruckner Expressway and I-95 parallel Bruckner Boulevard and run along the western edge of Pelham Bay Park. Entering exit 8A southbound services Westchester Avenue while northbound, exits 8B and 8C serve the Pelham Parkway and Shore Road through the park, which marks the northern end of the Bruckner Expressway. Now known as the New England Thruway, I-95 leaves Pelham Bay Park and enters exit 9, a junction with the Hutchinson River Parkway. In the middle of the interchange with the Hutchinson River, exit 10 forks to the left, reaching Gun Hill Road. Now paralleling Baychester Avenue, which also services exit 11 and Bartow Avenue, the New England Thruway continues north and enters exit 12 which connects to Baychester. Conner Street is connected to via exit 13 before I-95 turns east and crosses over the Hutchinson River. After crossing the river, the route enters an interchange once again with the Hutchinson River Parkway (exit 14) but this time westbound only. =Westchester= Shield for the New England Thruway used between 1958 and 1970. Crossing through the northern reaches of Pelham Bay Park, I-95 turns more northeast and enters Westchester County. Now in Pelham Manor, the route crosses through Pelham Country Club, entering exit 15, which connects to US 1 (Main Street). After US 1, the route crosses out of the Pelham Country Club, entering New Rochelle. Crossing over Metro-North Railroad tracks, the interstate turns northeast and crossing through downtown New Rochelle, reaching exit 16, serving several local streets including Cross Avenue, Cedar Street and Garden Street. North of exit 16, the New England Thruway enters its lone toll gantry along the alignment, serving the northbound direction only. The road continues northeast through New Rochelle, passing exit 17 as it enters the town of Mamaroneck. Exit 17 connects to Chatsworth Avenue in the Larchmont section. Passing a pedestrian footbridge for the Larchmont station, crossing over NY 125 (Weaver Street). Winding north through Mamaroneck, I-95 enters exit 18A, servicing Fenimore Road in the village of Mamaroneck. Turning northeast again, I-95 enters exit 18B, a partial cloverleaf interchange with Mamaroneck Avenue before crossing into the town of Harrison. The road turns east, crossing over NY 127 (Harrison Avenue), and enters exit 19, the western terminus of the Playland Parkway, which connects the expressway to Rye Playland as the road enters Rye. The route crosses through the Rye Village area, entering exit 20, which connects to US 1 (Boston Post Road) and the village. Almost immediately after exit 20, exit 21 marks the eastern end of the Cross-Westchester Expressway (I-287). Proceeding westbound, exit 21 and nearby exit 22 (Midland Avenue and Port Chester) are merged, but are separate exits going eastbound. Crossing through the eastern edges of Port Chester, I-95 reaches the Byram River and crosses into Connecticut, becoming the Connecticut Turnpike. History Robert Moses first recommended the construction of what became the New England Thruway in 1940. Construction began in 1951, but major work on the highway did not commence until 1956-1957. By 1950, the New York State Thruway Authority assumed control of the construction and made the New England Thruway a part of the Thruway toll system. Construction lasted until 1961. I-95 was assigned on August 14, 1957, as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, and has always run along its current path in New York. The route was overlaid on the under- construction New England Thruway northeast of New York City and assigned to the then-proposed Cross Bronx and Bruckner Expressways through New York City. The thruway opened in October 1958, connecting the Bruckner Expressway and the Connecticut Turnpike. The final sections of the Cross Bronx and Bruckner Expressways were finished in 1963 and 1972, respectively. Prior to the 1972 completion of the Bruckner, coinciding with the completion of the new Bruckner Interchange, the old Bruckner Boulevard (once part of NY 164) was used by through traffic. =Exit numbers= The first change to exit numbers along the New England Thruway section of Interstate 95 was in April 1980 when the section was converted for sequential exits. Prior to the change, the Cross Bronx Expressway and New England Thruway sections had different exit numbering systems. More specifically, exit 19 on the Cross Bronx Expressway was followed immediately by exit 2 on the New England Thruway. As a result, because exit numbers on I-95 repeated themselves in close succession, the old exit numbering system frequently caused confusion. As part of an experiment, I-95 was one of the few roads in New York to receive mileage-based exit numbers. This was implemented over both the Port Authority section and the NYSDOT section of the highway (Exits 1A through 8C). The Thruway section (which had originally carried its own sequential exit numbers) was then renumbered by the Thruway Authority to a system of sequential numbers starting from 9 (where the mileage-based system left off). This led to a situation in which Exits 1 through 8 were mileage based (all but one of which contained lettered suffixes as a result) and Exits 9 through 22 were sequential. Around 2005, NYSDOT began a project to renumber I-95 with sequential numbers throughout. However the idea never fully got traction with all three agencies. The Port Authority did complete the renumbering on its section of the road. NYSDOT itself renumbered only one section of the road in Parkchester. Meanwhile, the Thruway Authority did not renumber any of the exits on its stretch of the road. This led to a situation from 2005 through 2012 in which some exits were signed with two different numbers, while some numbers were repeated twice, but only on some of the signs. Finally, in 2012, NYSDOT restored the mileage-based numbers to its portion of the highway, which once again line up with the Thruway portion. This has eliminated all of the exit number conflicts, with one exception. The exception exists because the Port Authority has not changed the numbers back on its portion of the road creating a confusing situation at the Amsterdam Avenue exit, which is maintained by NYSDOT southbound but the Port Authority northbound. The exit is signed as Exit 1B southbound (which is the proper number within the mileage-based), but as Exit 2 northbound (a holdover from the failed renumbering project). Exit list Exit numbers on the New England Thruway (north of exit 8C) are sequential, but exit numbers on the remaining section are mileage-based. Auxiliary routes =Current= * I-295 runs southeast from the Bruckner Interchange along the Cross Bronx Expressway, then south over the Throgs Neck Bridge and Clearview Expressway to its terminus at Hillside Avenue, just south of the Grand Central Parkway. It was once signed as part of I-78 and was planned to terminate at the John F. Kennedy International Airport. * I-495 runs from the Queens-Midtown Tunnel east along the Long Island Expressway to Riverhead, crossing I-295 in Queens. It was once planned to continue west to I-95 in New Jersey; that part is now Lincoln Tunnel and New Jersey Route 495. It was also to go east and meet I-95 again in either Connecticut or in Rhode Island. This would have made I-495 a bypass road for I-95. * I-695 is a short route along the Throgs Neck Expressway, connecting I-295 to I-95 in the Bronx. It was once signed as part of I-78. The number had been used for other plans, including a route parallel to Woodhaven Boulevard and an upgrade of the West Side Highway and Henry Hudson Parkway. =Former= * I-895, also known as the Sheridan Expressway, was a short connection from I-278 to I-95 in the Bronx. It was planned to continue north from I-95 to rejoin it near Pelham Bay Park, making it another bypass road. I-895 was downgraded to NY 895 in 2017, and was converted to a boulevard between 2018 and 2019.

He was not recorded as a king (rex), though Hydatius wrote that inter Frumarium et Rechimundum oritur de regni potestate dissensio (\\"between Frumar and Rechimund arose a dissension of the power of the kingdom\\"). In 457 the Suevi split into two factions, one headed by Maldras raiding Lusitania and another led by Framta remaining in Galicia. After a few months of rule, Framta died and Rechimund appeared as his successor. While it is possible that the Suevi were living under a diarchy, it is more likely that the two factions remained independent of one another. Maldras' eventual successor, Frumar, was also not described as a king, but in 464 or thereabouts the entire Suevic nation was unified under a king named Remismund. Presumably, Rechimund and Frumar had battled for the throne and both had been eliminated, paving the way for Remismund.

He adjusted analytical techniques and quality control, was involved in the development of the first modern light beer, creating many new, unique, and successful specialty beers. He is regarded by some as the father of light beer, although the light beer that he developed used a process originated by, and obtained from, Swiss chemist Hersch Gablinger.\\"The First Beer With No Carbohydrates\\", Hartford Courant, Jan. 5, 1967, p. 44 Life and career Owades was born in Manhattan, the son of Jewish parents, and raised in the Bronx. His father, Shmuel, was a dressmaker. In 1939 he graduated from City College of New York (undergraduate), followed by New York University Tandon School of Engineering (Master's and PhD in biochemistry, 1944, 1950), with a dissertation on cholesterol titled Sterol Sulphates: A Study of Œ±Cholesterylene and Other Decomposition Products. After wartime work for the US Navy, he went on to Fleischmann's Yeast, Schwarz Laboratories in Mount Vernon, New York (where he taught the Schwarz Brewing Course), and Rheingold Breweries in Brooklyn, where he became Vice President‚ÄìTechnical Director. At Rheingold, Owades developed the recipe for Gablinger Beer, one of the first reduced calorie beers. Gablinger was brewed using a process invented by chemist Dr. Hersch Gablinger of Basel, Switzerland. Dr. Gablinger's process involved adding an enzyme (amyloglucosidase) to the wort during fermentation that converted nonfermentable starch into fermentable sugar. The use of this process eliminated carbohydrates from the finished beer, and allowed its caloric content to be reduced by about one-third, while also making it less filling. After Rheingold officials traveled to Europe and sampled Dr. Gablinger's beer, Rheingold bought the exclusive rights to use his process. Using Dr. Gablinger's process, Owades developed the recipe for Gablinger Beer, which was introduced by Rheingold in late 1966. Following his time at Rheingold, Owades went to work in Greece for the K. Fix Brewery, then moved to Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, Missouri, followed by Carling Breweries in Boston. In 1975 Owades formed the Center for Brewing Studies in San Francisco,www.manta.com where he provided consulting services to many micro- and mid-sized brewers and taught annual seminars, becoming known as \\"the Godfather of the Brewing Industry\\". Among his consulting clients were New Amsterdam Brewing in New York City; Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco; Boston Beer Company, where he developed the highly successful Samuel Adams lager; New Century Brewing, for whom he created Edison light beer; the Olde Heurich Brewing Company; and Rheingold Brewing, where he re-created the original Rheingold lager. Owades held many patents in the field of brewing and elsewhere. Owades received the 1994 Award of Merit from the Master Brewers Association of the Americas, and spoke before many brewing organizations. He was among those awarded the Sesquicentennial Medal as a distinguished alumnus by NYU Polytechnic University. He wrote the articles on beer and alcohol metabolism for the Encyclopedia of Food Science and Technology. He was named to the Board of the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where in 1999 he endowed the Joseph and Ruth Owades Chair in Chemistry. Owades died at his home in Sonoma, California on December 16, 2005.

Lapper played collegiate soccer at UCLA from 1988 to 1991. While a Bruin, Lapper won the 1990 National Championship, earning first team All American honors. While in college, Lapper also played with the local Los Angeles Heat of the Western Soccer League in 1988 and 1989. He was a WSL First Team All-Star in 1989. International Lapper made his debut for the United States on April 7, 1991 against South Korea. Lapper played for the U.S. 1991 Pan American Games gold medal soccer team, the 1992 Summer Olympics soccer team and the 1995 Copa America team which placed fourth at that tournament. In 1993, he played every U.S. game as a sweeper. When Bora Milutinoviƒá moved to a flat-back four defensive scheme, Lapper found himself relegated to the bench in favor of Alexi Lalas. However, he did make the U.S. team which played as host in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. This team advanced to the second round where it lost to Brazil, but Lapper failed to enter any of the U.S. games. He played several more matches at the end of 1994 and into 1995, but on August 16, 1995, he earned his last cap in a losing match to Sweden.

Lapper soon found himself in the position of so many American players in Europe during those years. The new manager, Gerd Roggensack, had no interest in American soccer players and Lapper found himself unable to even make the substitute list. At the time that Krautzun was fired, Wolfsburg stood at the top of the German Second Division. By the end of the season, it had slipped to fourth and failed to win promotion to the First Division. Lapper requested a transfer and in 1995, the team sent him to British Second Division club Southend United for ¬£100,000. At the time, Southend was pushing for promotion to the Premiership, but when it actually faced demotion to the second division in 1997, Lapper left Southend to sign with Major League Soccer (MLS).

The order was formerly named Protodonata, the \\"proto-Odonata\\", for their similar appearance and supposed relation to modern Odonata (damselflies and dragonflies). They range in Palaeozoic (Late Carboniferous to Late Permian) times. Though most were only slightly larger than modern dragonflies, the order includes the largest known insect species, such as the late Carboniferous Meganeura monyi, Megatypus, and the even larger early Permian Meganeuropsis permiana, with wingspans of up to . The giant Upper Carboniferous dragonfly relative, Meganeura monyi, attained a wingspan of about . Museum of Toulouse. The forewings and hindwings are similar in venation (a primitive feature) except for the larger anal (rearwards) area in the hindwing. The forewing is usually more slender and slightly longer than the hindwing. Unlike the true dragonflies, the Odonata, they had no pterostigma, and a somewhat simpler pattern of veins in the wings. Most specimens are known from wing fragments only; with only a few as complete wings, and even fewer (of the family Meganeuridae) with body impressions. These show a globose head with large dentate mandibles, strong spiny legs, a large thorax, and long and slender dragonfly-like abdomen. Like true dragonflies, they were presumably predators. A few nymphs are also known, and show mouthparts similar to those of modern dragonfly nymphs, suggesting that they were also active aquatic predators. Although sometimes included under the dragonflies, the Protodonata lack certain distinctive wing features that characterise the Odonata. point out that the colloquial term \\"giant dragonfly\\" is therefore misleading, and suggest \\"griffinfly\\" instead.  Size  Model of a meganisopteran. Controversy has prevailed as to how insects of the Carboniferous period were able to grow so large. The way oxygen is diffused through the insect's body via its tracheal breathing system puts an upper limit on body size, which prehistoric insects seem to have well exceeded. It was originally proposed in that Meganeura was only able to fly because the atmosphere at that time contained more oxygen than the present 20%. This theory was dismissed by fellow scientists, but has found approval more recently through further study into the relationship between gigantism and oxygen availability. If this theory is correct, these insects would have been susceptible to falling oxygen levels and certainly could not survive in our modern atmosphere. Other research indicates that insects really do breathe, with \\"rapid cycles of tracheal compression and expansion\\". Recent analysis of the flight energetics of modern insects and birds suggests that both the oxygen levels and air density provide a bound on size. A general problem with all oxygen related explanations of giant griffinflies is the circumstance that very large Meganeuridae with a wingspan of 45 cm also occurred in the Upper Permian of Lod√®ve in France, when the oxygen content of the atmosphere was already much lower than in the Carboniferous and Lower Permian. suggested that the lack of aerial vertebrate predators allowed pterygote insects to evolve to maximum sizes during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, maybe accelerated by an \\"evolutionary arms race\\" for increase in body size between plant-feeding Palaeodictyoptera and meganeurids as their predators.

Early life and education Allnutt was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and his family moved to Mexico when he was a year old. He is Jewish. He played street soccer in Mexico, but did not join an organized team until his family moved to San Diego, California when he was ten. Three years later, he began playing for the top youth club La Jolla Nomads, coached by Derek Armstrong. He moved up the clubs age groups, winning the McGuire Cup with the U-19 team. After graduating from University City High School in 1989, Allnutt played with the Nomads' senior team, also coached by Armstrong, the San Diego Nomads of the Western Soccer League. That year the Nomads won the WSL championship, defeating the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks 1‚Äì0. That autumn, Allnutt entered the University of Portland where he played forward on the Clive Charles coached men's soccer team from 1989 to 1992. He was a four-year starter on the team, scoring 27 goals and assisting on 17 others. He earned second-team All-American honors his senior year, 1992. On May 5, 2010, the school inducted Allnutt into its Athletic Hall of Fame. National teams In 1991, he played for the U.S. at the Pan American Games. He scored a goal in a 2-1 first round victory over Honduras. In 1992, Allnutt continued to play for the junior national team when he started all three games for the United States at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. While Allnutt played forward for Portland, he slotted back into the midfield or defensive winger with the Olympic and national teams. The U.S. team went 1-1-1 in group play and failed to make the second round. He earned his first cap with the senior national team later that year when he came on for Cobi Jones in a September 3 victory over Canada. He played one more game for the national team in 1992 and three in 1993. He scored in his only start for the team, a 4-1 loss to Honduras on March 25, 1993. In 2005, at the tail end of his career, he played for the United States in the 17th World Maccabiah Games. Allnutt helped the team take silver, losing to Argentina in the finals. Professional In 1993, the Portland Pride of the Continental Indoor Soccer League drafted Allnutt, but he lost the entire year after having surgery in June for torn groin ligaments. In 1994, he joined the Los Angeles Salsa of the American Professional Soccer League. Using his previous years living in Mexico, with his fluency in Spanish, Allnutt then moved to Mexico, where he became a forward on Primera Divisi√≥n A (division below the Premier Division) Inter de Tijuana. He scored 27 goals during his time with the team. He also spent time with Club Irapuato. While in Mexico, the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer drafted Allnutt in the 6th round (55 overall) of the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. However, the Revs released him on April 12, 1996. He signed with the Carolina Dynamo of the USISL Select League in March. On May 22, 1996, the Dynamo sent Allnutt on loan to the Kansas City Wiz for one game. In that game, he was a second half sub, playing 45 minutes and scoring a goal against the Revs. After being released by the Wizards, Allnutt joined the Carolina Dynamo for two seasons, earning team MVP honors both years. In 1996, he was the captain of the 1996 USISL Select League All Star Team. In 1997, he was the co-captain of the Dynamo and the team's leading scorer. He was named to the league's All Star list, known as the First XI, in 1997. On November 4, 1997 Allnutt signed with the Rochester Raging Rhinos. In 1998, he scored 14 goals and again made the A-League First XI. In 1999, Allnutt was part of the Rhinos team which took the 1999 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup becoming the only second division club to beat an MLS team (Colorado Rapids). Allnutt scored one of the goals for Rochester in that game. In 2000, the Rhinos continued its winning ways, by running away with the A-League championship, defeating the Minnesota Thunder 3-0 with Allnutt bagging one of the goals. In 2001, Allnutt again made the A-League First XI. His outstanding play led to the New England Revolution drafting him, for a second time, in the fourth round (42 overall) of the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Allnutt played only nine games with the Revs, not scoring a goal and assisting on only one.

Early career Morrison was born in New York (which was then under British occupation in the final days of the American War of Independence), the son of a senior Commissariat officer. He joined the British Army as an Ensign in 1793, and was present as a Lieutenant in the Anglo- Russian invasion of Holland in 1799, where he was severely wounded at the Battle of Egmont-op-Zee. He was promoted rapidly through purchase and in 1808, he was in command of the 2nd Battalion of the 89th Foot in Ireland as a Major. Inspecting field officers commented favourably both on the battalion and on Morrison himself. In November 1809, he exchanged into the 1st West India Regiment to gain promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel, serving in Trinidad. In July, 1811, he returned to the 2/89th as its commanding officer. The battalion was stationed in Gibraltar in 1812 when war broke out between Britain and the United States, and it was despatched to reinforce the British troops in Canada. Battle of Crysler's Farm In October 1813, the 2/89th were stationed at Kingston in Upper Canada when news arrived that a large American force was descending the Saint Lawrence River, intent on attacking Montreal. Morrison was placed in command of a Corps of Observation which included his own battalion, and was ordered to pursue and harass this American army. His force, numbering 900 and supported by gunboats under Captain William Mulcaster, was encamped at Crysler's Farm on 11 November. Major General James Wilkinson, commanding the American army, determined to drive Morrison's force away before proceeding further down the river. On favourable ground and using the classic British tactics of fighting in line and firing deliberate controlled volleys, Morrison's troops easily repulsed the American attack, even though outnumbered three to one, and captured a 6-pounder gun which the Americans abandoned as they retreated. Later career and death In July 1814, Morrison was severely wounded at the Battle of Lundy's Lane, and saw no further action in the War of 1812, although he was a member of the court martial board which tried Major General Henry Procter for negligence following the defeat at the Battle of Moraviantown. After the war, he transferred to the deactivated Sicilian Regiment and went on half pay until 1821. He then became Lieutenant-Colonel of the 44th Foot, which was posted to Calcutta in India. He was promoted to Brigadier-General to command a brigade in an expedition to the province of Arakan during the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824. Although the expedition was successful, Arakan was notorious for malaria and other diseases, and Morrison and many of his men fell ill with tropical fever. He died at sea on the voyage back to Britain. In early 1809 he had married Elizabeth Hester Marriott of Worcester. He and his wife had no children.

History and mission  Terry Belanger founded the Book Arts Press at the Columbia University School of Library Service in 1972 as a laboratory for various programs concerned with the history of books and printing, descriptive bibliography, the antiquarian book trade, and rare book and special collections librarianship. When Belanger became University Professor and Honorary Curator of Special Collections at the University of Virginia in 1992. The BAP and its collections moved with him to Charlottesville, its name was changed in 2000 to Rare Book School, and for the most part the Book Arts Press name was restricted to RBS publications. At UVa, RBS supports courses concerning the history of the book and related subjects. It carries on exhibition and publication programs under the Book Arts Press imprint, and it sponsors public lectures‚Äînotably the annual Sol. M. and Mary Ann O'Brian Malkin Lecture in Bibliography. But its principal activity is an annually-offered schedule of about 30 short non-credit courses on subjects ranging from the history of bookbinding to modern fine printing. The majority of these courses are offered in Charlottesville, but courses are also currently offered in New York City (at the Grolier Club and at The Morgan Library & Museum), in Baltimore (at the Walters Art Museum and Johns Hopkins University, in Washington, DC (at the Freer Gallery of Art/Arthur M. Sackler Gallery), in Cambridge, MA (at Houghton Library), in New Haven, CT (at the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library), and in Bloomington, IN (at the Lilly Library). Many of its faculty are world-renowned in their field, and it has extensive teaching collections. Its students apply competitively for admission to the school's five-day courses. RBS students, typically about 40 years old, include curators and rare book librarians, established and young academics, antiquarian booksellers, book conservators and binders, and book collectors. The school employs a course evaluation system in which attendees write detailed prose accounts of their experience at the school. Their comments are then mounted permanently and in their entirety on the school's web site.  Collections  RBS has a collection of printing presses and equipment that includes a full-scale reproduction of a wooden common press (of the sort Benjamin Franklin might have used), a 19th-century Washington iron hand-press (such presses could be broken down and loaded into a Conestoga wagon), and a 20th-century flatbed cylinder proof press (a Vandercook SP-15, favorite of modern private-press letterpress printers). RBS's printing-house comprises 200 cases of printing type (including the 48-case Annenberg collection of wood type), a small Brand etching press, and various pieces of hand bookbinding equipment. RBS owns about 50,000 books and 20,000 prints, dating from the 15th century to the present. Many of the books‚Äîincluding a large collection assembled to illustrate the history of cloth bookbindings‚Äîare on display in the McGregor Room of Alderman Library. Others may be seen in glass-fronted bookcases in the Dome Room of the Rotunda (the original library of the university), located a short distance from Alderman Library on the Central Grounds of the university. Other collections are kept in the RBS classroom and studio‚Äîrooms which, together with the Pressroom, make up the RBS suite in Alderman Library. RBS classes make heavy use of the RBS collections. The institute annually attracts about 300 students, who come for one or more five- day non-credit courses taught by an international roster of specialists in the history of the manuscript book, typography, book illustration, bookbinding, descriptive bibliography, rare book librarianship, and related subjects. While they are at UVa, many RBS students and faculty members live on the Lawn in rooms designed by Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the university. The physical arrangement of the RBS book and print collection supports both classroom and independent study. The books are generally shelved by date (rather than by author or subject), to show the chronological development of parchment, leather, cloth, and paper bindings. Many of the prints are filed by technique (rather than by artist or engraver), to facilitate the identification of illustration processes. Other RBS collection arrangements assist the study of various formats, genres, materials, and physical features such as sewing structures, endpapers, and dust-jackets. An unusual feature of some of these collections is the presence of multiple copies (sometimes as many as a dozen or more) of the same (or almost the same) book‚Äîa duplication valuable not only for facilitating group viewing in the classroom but also for demonstrating the bibliographical principle that almost exactly the same can be another way of saying quite different. RBS also maintains a library of about 2,000 recently published books on various aspects of the history of the book: paper making, typefounding, typography, printing, illustration, binding, publishing, bookselling, collecting, the antiquarian book trade, and related areas. This non-circulating reference collection ensures that the most useful books for RBS's purposes are always close at hand. Supplementing this library are much larger holdings on the same subjects in the Alderman Library stacks and in various UVa special collections.  Website  Rare Book School's website contains a variety of material of potential interest to those who wish to pursue the study of the history of the book and related fields, whether independently or within a classroom setting. All RBS courses have advance reading lists, freely available to all who wish to consult them, whether admitted to a course or not. There is a frequently updated of the principal librarians, curators, directors, and the like working in member institutions of the Association of Research Libraries. The school's faculty directory provides information about many prominent students of book history and related subjects. The website Links page provides a short but carefully structured guide to various resources in the field, and it provides information about current and previous RBS exhibitions, and forthcoming and previous public lectures (generally about a dozen per year). James Green, Librarian of the Library Company of Philadelphia, gave Rare Book School lecture no. 500 in July 2007.  Exhibitions program  In 1995, RBS began to mount book exhibitions in the Dome Room of the UVa Rotunda, the principal room of the University. (The UVa Library's Special Collections department mounted its own exhibitions in Alderman Library's McGregor Room until 2004, when it shifted its operations to a space in the new building, Harrison/Small.) Most of the exhibitions have been conceived and mounted by students in one or another of Terry Belanger's undergraduate courses in the history of the book. Among the more notable student exhibitions are \\"Books Go to War: Armed Service Editions in World War II],\\" curated in 1996 by Daniel J. Miller ('96); \\"Two for a Nickel,\\" an exhibition of Thomas Jefferson and Monticello ephemera, curated in 1999 by Elliot Tally ('99); \\"Reading with and without Dick and Jane: the Politics of Literacy in c20 America\\", curated in 2003 by Elizabeth Tandy Shermer ('03); and \\"The Call of the Wild: Character Building and the Boy Scout Handbook,\\" curated in 2005 by William Ingram ('05). RBS's ongoing program of large-scale book exhibitions using undergraduate curators who have almost complete control over their contents is thought to be the only one of its kind in the United States. Other RBS exhibitions include the widely reviewed Alt URL \\"Eyre Apparent: An Exhibition Celebrating Charlotte Bronte's Classic Novel,\\" co- curated by John Buchtel (formerly on the RBS staff) and Barbara Heritage (RBS curator of collections, which traveled to the Peabody Institute Library at Johns Hopkins University in 2007, after its 2005-06 showing in the Dome Room.  Governance  During its Columbia University years, RBS had no independent existence; it was part of the University's School of Library Service. When the library school closed in 1992 and RBS moved to the University of Virginia, the school became a non-profit corporation in Virginia. RBS was granted tax-exempt (501(c)(3)) status by the Internal Revenue Service in 2002, and UVa's Alumni Fund, which had held RBS's assets in trust since 1992, turned them over to the RBS Board of Directors, and the school became fully independent. In 2007, RBS was granted Affiliated Foundation status by UVa's Board of Visitors. the chair of the RBS Board of Directors was John Crichton (San Francisco, CA); Szilvia Szmuk-Tanenbaum (New York, NY) was vice-chair; Beppy Landrum Owen (Orlando, FL) was secretary; Joan M. Friedman (Urbana, IL) was treasurer. Michael F. Suarez, S.J., was the executive director of Rare Book School.  Succession  In 2007, RBS director Terry Belanger announced that he planned to step down as director of RBS in 2009. In the summer of 2008, UVa and RBS established a joint search committee chaired by Beverly P. Lynch to find a successor. On June 18, 2009, UVa President John T. Casteen III announced that Michael F. Suarez had accepted appointments as University Professor and Professor of English at UVa and as director of RBS, effective September 1, 2009.  Friends of Rare Book School  Rare Book School and the Book Arts Press are supported by a 650-member friends group, the Friends of Rare Book School. Since 1976, individual Friends have contributed more than $2 million, as well as many gifts in kind. In addition, more than two hundred North American and European libraries have donated unwanted, damaged, and defective books (or parts of books) both old and new to the RBS collections. There are five classes of Friends. The regular membership is $50/year. Good Friends of Rare Book School contribute $100 or more/year, Very Good Friends pay $250 or more/year, Close Friends pay $500 or more/year, and Best Friends donate $1,000 or more/year. As part of their membership, Friends of Rare Book School receive an occasional newsletter, and a copy of the Book Arts Press Address Book, published every other year.  The Campaign for RBS  At the beginning of 2006, RBS embarked on the public phase of a $2 million endowment campaign (the school's endowment then stood at about $150,000). The campaign was supported by a $333,000 3:1 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, awarded in June 2006, and by a bequest of approximately $835,000 from the late Mary Ann O'Brian Malkin. The first phase of the campaign ended in December 2008, having raised $1 million in NEH matching funds.  Year-round staff  The year-round staff members at Rare Book School are: * Michael F.

Bakley was fatally shot while sitting in Blake's parked car outside a Los Angeles-area restaurant in May 2001. In 2002, Robert Blake was charged with Bakley's murder, solicitation of murder, conspiracy and special circumstance of lying in wait. In March 2005, a jury found Blake not guilty of the crimes. Seven months later, Blake was found liable in a wrongful death lawsuit brought against him by Bakley's children. Officially, Bakley's murder remains unsolved. Early life Bonny Lee Bakley was born in Morristown, New Jersey\\"Blake Transferred To County Jail As He Awaits Murder Charges\\" , WMAQ-TV, April 19, 2002. Accessed October 15, 2007. \\"The Morristown, N.J., native had a criminal record for a 1989 drug-related arrest in Tennessee, where she associated herself with singer Jerry Lee Lewis and his sister.\\" to arborist Edward J. Bakley and his wife, Marjorie Lois Bakley. Bakley had three siblings: Margerry Lisa Bakley, Joe Bakley, and her half-brother Peter Carlyon from her mother's second marriage. She was raised by and lived with her grandmother in Glen Gardner, New Jersey while her mother operated an antique business at 6 Kossuth Street in Wharton, New Jersey. Bakley dropped out of high school at age 16 and decided to go to New York City to pursue a career in modeling and acting at the Barbizon School of Modeling. She met an immigrant named Evangelos Paulakis who needed to get married in order to stay in the United States. Bakley agreed to marry him for a price, but then she almost immediately ended the marriage and he was deported.ThoughtCo profile of Bonny Lee Bakley At age 21, she married her first cousin Paul Gawron. At roughly five years, this would prove to be the longest of her ten marriages, and they had two children together: Glenn and Holly. The couple divorced in 1982. In an effort to support herself, Bakley began a mail-order business sending nude pictures of women, including herself, to men. She also ran \\"lonely hearts\\" ads in magazines advertising for a \\"male companion.\\" After communicating with the men who answered her ads, she would ask for money for rent or travel expenses. Bakley's business and scams eventually afforded her enough money to buy several houses in Memphis and a house outside Los Angeles. She was unsuccessful, however, in her Hollywood career as a singer and actor under the stage name Lee Bonny. Legal issues Due to the nature of Bakley's mail-order business and other dealings, she was arrested several times. In 1989, she was arrested in Memphis for drug possession and fined $300. In 1995, she was arrested for attempting to pass two bad checks from an account of a Memphis record company. Bakley was fined $1,000 and sentenced to work on a penal farm on weekends after she plea bargained down to lesser charges. In 1998, she was arrested in Little Rock, Arkansas for possessing five driver's licenses and seven Social Security cards with different names. She used the IDs to open various post-office boxes in order to run her \\"lonely hearts\\" scam. Celebrity obsession Bakley had a history of pursuing celebrities. Her friends and relatives described her as \\"celebrity-obsessed.\\" Tapes of Bakley's phone conversations reveal that she was starstruck and determined to marry someone famous. \\"Being around celebrities,\\" she once said, \\"it makes you feel better than other people.\\" In 1990, she moved to Memphis and began pursuing singer Jerry Lee Lewis. Bakley eventually did meet Lewis and even became close friends with Lewis' sister, Linda Gail Lewis. In 1993, Bakley claimed that the daughter she gave birth to, Jeri Lee, was Lewis' child. However, DNA tests later disproved her claim. After Jeri Lee's birth, Bakley decided to relocate to California. She left Jeri Lee with her ex-husband Paul to raise, but continued to financially support the child. While in California, Bakley pursued other celebrities, including Dean Martin, Frankie Valli (Bakley claimed they dated when she was a teenager. Valli denied the claim), and Gary Busey. In 1991, Bakley became interested in Christian Brando. Christian, the eldest son of Academy Award- winning actor Marlon Brando and actress Anna Kashfi, became a media fixture when he was tried for the murder of his half sister's boyfriend, Dag Drollet. Brando pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to ten years in prison. While he was in prison, Bakley began writing him and sending photos. After his release in 1996, Brando and Bakley began a romantic relationship. In 1999, Bakley discovered she was pregnant and initially thought that Brando was the child's father. In June 2000, she gave birth to her fourth child, a daughter she named Christian Shannon Brando. =Marriage to Robert Blake= While Bakley was involved with Christian Brando, she was also dating actor Robert Blake whom she met at a jazz club in 1999. After the birth of daughter Christian Shannon Brando, Bakley told Blake that she was unsure of the child's paternity and that he might be the father of the child. Blake insisted on a paternity test which later determined that Blake, not Brando, was the father of Bakley's youngest child. After paternity was established, the child's name was legally changed to Rose Lenore Sophia Blake. Blake agreed to marry Bakley under the condition that she sign a temporary custody agreement. Under the agreement, Bakley agreed to monitored visits with Rose and to get written permission for her friends and family to visit Blake's property. The agreement also stipulated that if either spouse decided to end the marriage, the other spouse would retain custody of Rose. Bakley's attorney advised her not to sign the document because he thought it was \\"lopsided\\". Eager to marry Blake, she ignored her attorney's advice and signed the agreement on October 4, 2000. Bakley and Blake were married in November 2000. Although they were married, the couple never lived together. Bakley and Rose lived in a small guest house beside Blake's house in Studio City of the San Fernando Valley. The relationship was reportedly rocky; Blake was distrustful of Bakley and hired a private investigator to find more information about her. Blake later found out that Bakley had continued to operate her \\"lonely hearts\\" ad scam during the marriage. Marriages and children Before her marriage to Robert Blake, Bakley was married ten times (many of the marriages were short-lived with one lasting a single day). Her eighth husband was Glynn Wolfe, famous for holding the record for the largest number of monogamous marriages. Bakley had four children: a son named Glenn and a daughter named Holly with her first cousin and second ex-husband Paul Gawron; a daughter named Jeri Lee Lewis (born July 28, 1993) with an unspecified man, after DNA tests disproved her claim that the child was fathered by Jerry Lee Lewis; and daughter Rose Lenore Sophia Blake (born in June 2000 and initially named Shannon Christian Brando) with actor Robert Blake. Death On May 4, 2001, Blake took Bakley to an Italian dinner at Vitello's Restaurant on Tujunga Avenue in Studio City. Afterward, Bakley was killed by a gunshot wound to the head while sitting in her car, which was parked on a side street around the corner from the restaurant. Blake claimed that he had returned to the restaurant to collect a gun which he had left there, and was not present when the shooting occurred. The gun that Blake claimed he had left in the restaurant was later determined not to have fired the shots that killed Bakley. She was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills Memorial Park in Los Angeles. Criminal and civil suits On March 16, 2005, Blake was found not guilty of the murder of Bonny Lee Bakley, and of one of the two counts of soliciting a former stuntman to murder her. The other count of solicitation was dropped after it was revealed that the jury was deadlocked 11‚Äì1 in favor of an acquittal. Blake's defense, led by M. Gerald Schwartzbach, attacked the credibility of associates who alleged Blake had wanted to hire them to kill Bakley, and also raised the possibility the victim was murdered by one of the men she had conned out of money in the past. Law professor Laurie Levenson stated the prosecution established a possible motive for murder (Blake's vitriol towards Bakley due to his belief she'd tricked him into fathering a child to access his wealth), but had failed beyond that to prove Blake directly or indirectly was responsible for killing her. CBS News legal analyst David Hancock wrote: \\"there was no single part of their case that was strong enough to overcome the many weak links.\\" Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley, commenting on this ruling, called Blake a \\"miserable human being\\" and the jurors \\"incredibly stupid.\\" Blake's defense team and members of the jury responded by stating that the prosecution had failed to prove its case. During the trial, the defense alleged that Bakley was a drug addict who used her oldest daughter, Holly, for prostitution. On November 18, 2005, Blake was found liable for the wrongful death of his wife in a civil trial. Bakley's three eldest children sued him, asserting that he was responsible for their mother's death. The trial included a famous Perry Mason moment when Eric Dubin, the attorney for Bakley's family, called the girlfriend of Blake's longtime bodyguard and co-defendant Earle Caldwell to the stand and asked if she believed they were involved in the crime, something no one had asked her before. \\"Dead silence filled the court,\\" Dubin recalled. \\"Tears filled her eyes as she paused for what seemed like a decade, then leaned into the microphone and said that yes, she did believe that they were involved.\\" The jury ordered Blake to pay $30 million. In 2006, Blake filed for bankruptcy, with debts of $3 million for unpaid legal fees as well as state and federal taxes. On April 26, 2008, an appeals court upheld the civil case verdict, but cut Blake's penalty assessment in half, to $15 million. Blake's attorneys had protested that jurors improperly discussed the Michael Jackson and O. J. Simpson verdicts during deliberations of his case, but the appeals judge ruled that such discussions were not improper. On April 9, 2010, the state of California filed a tax lien against Blake for $1,110,878 in unpaid back taxes.

It chronicles the plight of the environment and the Lorax, who \\"speaks for the trees\\" and confronts the Once-ler, who causes environmental destruction. As in most Dr. Seuss works, most of the creatures mentioned are original to the book. The story is commonly recognized as a fable concerning the danger of human destruction of the natural environment, using the literary element of personification to create relatable characters for industry (as the Once-ler), the environment (the Truffula trees) and activism (as the Lorax). The story encourages personal care and involvement in making the situation better: \\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\\" It was Dr. Seuss's personal favorite of his books. He was able to create a story addressing industrial/economic and environmental issues without it being dull: \\"The Lorax came out of me being angry.

Project MUSE. Web. October 20, 2014. . Plot A young unnamed boy living in a polluted area visits a strange isolated man called the Once-ler on the Street of the Lifted Lorax. The boy pays the Once-ler fifteen cents, a nail, and the shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail to hear the legend of how the Lorax was lifted and taken away. The Once-ler tells the boy of his arrival in a beautiful valley containing a forest of Truffula trees and a range of animals. The Once-ler, having long searched for such a tree as the Truffula, cut one down and used its silk-like foliage to knit a Thneed, an impossibly versatile garment. The Lorax, who \\"speaks for the trees,\\" emerged from the stump of the Truffula and voiced his disapproval both of the sacrifice of the tree and of the Thneed itself. However, the first other person to happen by purchased the Thneed for $3.98, so the Once-ler was encouraged and started a business making and selling Thneeds. The Once-ler's small shop soon grew into a factory. The Once-ler's relatives all came to work for him and new vehicles and equipment were brought in to log the Truffula forest and ship out Thneeds. The Lorax appeared again to report that the small bear-like Bar-ba-loots, who eat Truffula fruits, were short of food and had been sent away to find more. The Lorax later returned to complain that the factory had polluted the air and the water, forcing the Swomee-Swans and Humming-Fish to migrate as well. The Once-ler was unrepentant and defiantly told the Lorax that he would keep on \\"biggering\\" his business, but at that very moment, one of his machines chopped down the very last Truffula tree of them all. Without any raw materials, the factory shut down and the Once-ler's relatives promptly abandoned him in the now-decimated environment. The Lorax said nothing but with one sad backward glance lifted himself into the air \\"by the seat of his pants\\" and disappeared behind the smoggy clouds. Where he last stood is a small pile of rocks with a single word: \\"UNLESS\\". The Once-ler pondered the message for years, in solitude and self-imposed exile. In the present, as his buildings fall apart around him, the Once-ler at last realizes out loud what the Lorax meant: \\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\\" He then gives the boy the last Truffula seed and urges him to grow a forest from it, saying that, if the trees can be protected from logging, then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back. Inspiration It is believed that a Monterey cypress in La Jolla, California was the inspiration for The Lorax. On June 16, 2019, the tree was reported to have fallen.Michelle Lou The tree thought to have inspired Dr. Seuss' 'The Lorax' has fallen June 16, 2019 CNN Reception Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed The Lorax as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\". In 2012 it was ranked number 33 among the \\"Top 100 Picture Books\\" in a survey published by School Library Journal ‚Äì the second of five Dr. Seuss books on the list. In a retrospective critique written in the journal Nature in 2011 upon the 40th anniversary of the book's publication, Emma Marris described the Lorax character as a \\"parody of a misanthropic ecologist\\". She called the book \\"gloomy\\" and expressed skepticism that its message would resonate with small children in the manner intended. Nevertheless, she praised the book as effective in conveying the consequences of ecological destruction in a way that young children will understand. Controversy In 1988, a small school district in California kept the book on a reading list for second graders, though some in the town claimed the book was unfair to the logging industry.\\"California: Chopping Down Dr. Seuss\\". Time. October 2, 1989. Terri Birkett, a member of a family-owned hardwood flooring factory, authored The Truax,\\"Truax\\". Terri Birkett. National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA) Environmental Committee. (PDF). offering a logging-friendly perspective to an anthropomorphic tree known as the Guardbark. This book was published by the National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA). Just as in The Lorax, the book consists of a disagreement between two people. The logging industry representative states that they have efficiency and re-seeding efforts. The Guardbark, a personification of the environmentalist movement much as the Once-ler is for big business, refuses to listen and lashes out. But in the end, he is convinced by the logger's arguments. However, this story was criticized for what were viewed as skewed arguments and clear self-interest, particularly a \\"casual attitude toward endangered species\\" that answered the Guardbark's concern for them. In addition, the book's approach as a more blatant argument, rather than one worked into a storyline, was also noted. The line \\"I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie\\" was removed more than fourteen years after the story was published, after two research associates from the Ohio Sea Grant Program wrote to Seuss about the clean-up of Lake Erie. The line remains in the home video releases of the television special, in the audiobook read by Rik Mayall, and in the UK edition published by HarperCollins Children's Books. Adaptations Placard \\"We speak for the trees\\", reference to The Lorax, at the People's Climate March (2017). =1972 television special= The book was adapted as an animated musical television special produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, directed by Hawley Pratt and starring the voices of Eddie Albert and Bob Holt. It was first aired by CBS on February 14, 1972. A reference to pollution of Lake Erie was spoken by one of the Humming-Fish as they depart; it remains in DVD releases of the show, although later removed from the book. The special also shows the Once-ler arguing with himself, and asking the Lorax whether shutting down his factory (thus putting hundreds of people out of work) is practical. An abridged version of the special is used in the 1994 TV movie In Search of Dr. Seuss, with Kathy Najimy's reporter character hearing the Once-ler's story. =2012 feature film= On March 2, 2012, Universal Studios and Illumination Entertainment released a 3-D CGI film based upon the book. The release coincided with the 108th birthday of Seuss, who died at 87 in 1991. The cast includes Danny DeVito as the Lorax, Zac Efron as Ted (the boy in the book), and Ed Helms as the Once-ler. The film includes several new characters: Rob Riggle as villain Aloysius O'Hare, Betty White as Ted's Grammy Norma, Jenny Slate as Ted's neurotic mother Mrs. Wiggins, and Taylor Swift as Audrey, Ted's romantic interest. The film debuted in the No. 1 spot at the box office, making $70 million, though it received mixed reviews. The film eventually grossed a domestic total of $214,030,500. =Audiobooks= Two audio readings have been released on CD, one narrated by Ted Danson in the United States (Listening Library, ) and one narrated by Rik Mayall in the United Kingdom (HarperCollins, ). =Musical= A musical adaptation of The Lorax was originally included in the script for the Broadway musical Seussical, but was cut before the show opened. From December 2, 2015, to January 16, 2016, a musical version of the book ran at the Old Vic theatre in London, with former Noah and the Whale frontman Charlie Fink, who also wrote the music for the production.

It is located in the Sapna valley in the district of Amadiya. In the village, there are Chaldean Catholic churches of Mart Shmune, Sultana Mahdokht, and Mar Awda. There is also a church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Etymology According to local tradition, the name of the village is derived from \\"ara\\" (\\"land\\" in Syriac) and \\"aden\\" (\\"Eden\\" in Syriac), and thus translates to \\"land of Eden\\". History It is suggested that one or all of the churches of Mart Shmune, Sultana Mahdokht, and Mar Awda may have been constructed over a thousand years ago. Local tradition attests that the church of Sultana Mahdokht was constructed by a pilgrim who was instructed to build a church there in a dream from the saint after he had discovered a relic of the saint's arm. The population of Araden were likely adherents of the Church of the East long before the 14th century. The village was a notable centre of manuscript production, and the earliest surviving manuscript copied at Araden is dated to 1571. The inhabitants of Araden were converted to Chaldean Catholicism in the 1830s by Joseph Audo, archbishop of Amadiya, and Dominican missionaries. Therefore, in 1850, 50-75 Chaldean Catholic families inhabited Araden, and were served by two functioning churches and one priest as part of the archdiocese of Amadiya. By 1913, the community had expanded to 650 Chaldean Catholics, with two priests, two schools, and one functioning church. The village was inhabited by 515 Assyrians in c. 1933, and the church of Mart Shmune was rebuilt in 1935. A small Jewish community resided at Araden until their emigration to Israel in 1950-1951. The village's population fluctuated dramatically, as it grew to approximately 5000 Assyrians, with 474 families, in 1954, then decreased to 1049 people in the census of 1957. At the onset of the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1961, Araden was inhabited by c. 3000 people, with 350 families, in which year the village was bombed and then razed by 700 Iraqi government forces, dispersing the villagers, some of whom were killed by government-allied Kurdish irregulars under the leadership of Mahmud Agha Zebari, father of the Kurdish politician Hoshyar Zebari. At the war's end in 1971, c. 80 families returned to Araden, but most were forced to take refuge elsewhere in 1975 after the resumption of violence with the eruption of the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War. Araden was rebuilt in subsequent years, but its population continued to be targeted, resulting in the murder of three Assyrians in 1974-1975, and assassination of the village mukhtar (headman) Dinkha Eshaya in 1981. The village was completely destroyed and its inhabitants displaced by the Iraqi government in 1987 by which time Araden's population had grown to 220 families, and there were two schools. The churches at Araden were spared destruction after negotiations with the Iraqi forces. The conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991 spurred some of the village's former inhabitants to return, and a number of houses were rebuilt with the support of Hanna Kello, Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Amadiya, in 1992-1993. By 2004, Araden's population had grown to 35 families, and in early 2009, 234 displaced Assyrians, with 72 families, resided at Araden. By 2011, the Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs had constructed 90 houses, a school, and hall, restored 25 houses and the churches, and developed the village's infrastructure. The village was populated by 320 Chaldean Catholics in 2012, however, only 46 families reside at Araden as of 2013. It was reported that the vicinity of the village was bombed by the Turkish Air Force after the commencement of Operation Tigris Shield in June 2018, and Turkish airstrikes had disrupted farming.

Haldankar. The work was painted 1945‚Äì46 and is currently stored in the Sri Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery at the Jaganmohan Palace in Mysore, India. The painting is currently on display on the second floor of the museum, in an enclave with a curtained window. The enclave is normally darkened, which highlights the subtlety of the glowing brass lamp in the piece. When the light is turned on, the painting reveals remarkably subtle shades of pink and lavender in the woman's sari. Opening the enclave's curtain leads to yet another distinct view of the painting, the natural light exposing even more subtle gradations and details. The painting shows an Indian woman holding a lighted lamp in one hand, the other hand covering the light of the lamp from the front. The woman is in a simple and traditional Indian saree. The effect of the painting is heightened by the shadow of the woman in the back. The painting is housed in a special room at the Sri Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery. It is displayed in an enclave with a curtained window. The enclave is normally darkened, which highlights the subtlety of the glowing lamp in the painting. One can see in the dark the hand which is covering the candle ‚Äî which is the only thing that is giving out light ‚Äî is glowing very bright red, seems that it is authentic ;her hand really seems to be glowing due to the lamp's light.

On 2 February 2017 she turned 100. She had four daughters and one son (Meena Shertukade, Lali Akojwar, Jyoti Shah, (Sandhya) Sonali Punatar, and Rajprakash Uplekar). The young woman had to stay in the perpetual position for three hours continuously. Furthermore, he made this portrait with watercolours. He used this as his medium because he wanted to show the world that he could make a painting without a single mistake, unlike the oil paint which can be corrected using white paint.

Simulation can be performed at varying degrees of physical abstraction, such as at the transistor level, gate level, register-transfer level (RTL), electronic system-level (ESL), or behavioral level. Use in verification Logic simulation may be used as part of the verification process in designing hardware. Simulations have the advantage of providing a familiar look and feel to the user in that it is constructed from the same language and symbols used in design. By allowing the user to interact directly with the design, simulation is a natural way for the designer to get feedback on their design. Length of simulation The level of effort required to debug and then verify the design is proportional to the maturity of the design. That is, early in the design's life, bugs and incorrect behavior are usually found quickly. As the design matures, the simulation will require more time and resources to run, and errors will take progressively longer to be found. This is particularly problematic when simulating components for modern-day systems; every component that changes state in a single clock cycle on the simulation will require several clock cycles to simulate. A straightforward approach to this issue may be to emulate the circuit on a field-programmable gate array instead. Formal verification can also be explored as an alternative to simulation, although a formal proof is not always possible or convenient. A prospective way to accelerate logic simulation is using distributed and parallel computations.Software system for distributed event-driven logic simulation. Ladyzhensky Y.V., Popoff Y.V. Proceedings of IEEE East-West Design & Test Workshop(EWDTW'05). IEEE EWDTW, 2005, p.119-122 To help gauge the thoroughness of a simulation, tools exist for assessing code coverage, functional coverage and logic coverage tools.  Event simulation versus cycle simulation  Event simulation allows the design to contain simple timing information ‚Äì the delay needed for a signal to travel from one place to another. During simulation, signal changes are tracked in the form of events. A change at a certain time triggers an event after a certain delay. Events are sorted by the time when they will occur, and when all events for a particular time have been handled, the simulated time is advanced to the time of the next scheduled event. How fast an event simulation runs depends on the number of events to be processed (the amount of activity in the model). While event simulation can provide some feedback regarding signal timing, it is not a replacement for static timing analysis. In cycle simulation, it is not possible to specify delays. A cycle-accurate model is used, and every gate is evaluated in every cycle. Cycle simulation therefore runs at a constant speed, regardless of activity in the model. Optimized implementations may take advantage of low model activity to speed up simulation by skipping evaluation of gates whose inputs didn't change. In comparison to event simulation, cycle simulation tends to be faster, to scale better, and to be better suited for hardware acceleration / emulation. However, chip design trends point to event simulation gaining relative performance due to activity factor reduction in the circuit (due to techniques such as clock gating and power gating, which are becoming much more commonly used in an effort to reduce power dissipation). In these cases, since event simulation only simulates necessary events, performance may no longer be a disadvantage over cycle simulation. Event simulation also has the advantage of greater flexibility, handling design features difficult to handle with cycle simulation, such as asynchronous logic and incommensurate clocks. Due to these considerations, almost all commercial logic simulators have an event based capability, even if they primarily rely on cycle based techniques.Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook, by Lavagno, Martin, and Scheffer, , a survey of the field of EDA.

Life and career Cordeiro was born in Santo Andr√©, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. He began singing at 6 years old when he joined a church choir called \\"Cordeirinhos do Senhor\\". He went on to become famous as a street singer. He had his first TV performance with his own version of the aria of the Queen of the Night (W. A. Mozart). In 1996, he won the \\"Pr√™mio Sharp\\" for the best Brazilian pop singer. Cordeiro first toured Europe in 1995. He was greatly acclaimed after his concerts, especially in Germany, where he also performed on national TV. His repertoire covers everything from opera and lieder to traditional Brazilian folksongs to 1970s disco music. It includes covers of Nina Hagen, Janis Joplin, Grace Jones, Prince and √âdith Piaf, along with medieval psalms. As a vocal talent, Cordeiro is comparable to exotic Peruvian singer Yma Sumac, who in her heyday also had a four-octave voice. Indeed, Cordeiro covered one of Sumac's songs: \\"Babal√∫\\". Today, Cordeiro performs mainly in South America, with a recent brief stint in Germany. He has lived in Germany for over a decade due, he says, to the homophobic harassment he suffered in Brazil. He is married to German writer Oliver Bieber.

Chamran was chosen as its military head. Upon his return to the US in 1965 he founded a group, Red Shiism, in San Jose with the aim of training militants. His brother, Mehdi, was also part of the group. In 1968, he founded another group, the Muslim Students‚Äô Association of America (MSA), and it was led by Ebrahim Yazdi. The group managed to establish branches in the United Kingdom and France. In 1971 Chamran left the US for Lebanon and joined the camps of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Amal movement.

The book was published by Viking Press on May 8, 2000, and won the 2000 National Book Award for Nonfiction. It was adapted into a film of the same name, which came out in late 2015. Summary The Essex, an American whaleship from Nantucket, Massachusetts, sank after a sperm whale attacked it in the Pacific Ocean in November 1820. Having lost their ship, the crew of the Essex attempted to sail to South America in whaleboats. After suffering from starvation and dehydration, most of the crew died before the survivors were rescued in February 1821. In retelling the story of the crew's ordeal, Philbrick utilizes an account written by Thomas Nickerson, who was a teenage cabin boy on board the Essex and wrote about the experience in his old age; Nickerson's account was found in 1960 but was not authenticated until 1980. In 1984, an abridged version of his account was finally published. The book also utilizes the better known account of Owen Chase, the ship's first mate, which was published soon after the ordeal.

The main reason for this is that in cool or cloudy conditions many people are unaware that they are still vulnerable to the burning effects of the sun's UV radiation, so fail to take precautionary sun protection measures. This increases their risk of sustaining a sunburn, which they may then falsely attribute to the wind. The fact that windburn was really misattributed sunburn, rather than an actual condition in its own right, was shown as early as 1936 by English skin specialist Charles Howard White of Cambridge and American physicist William Henry Crew of New York University. Nonetheless, the accepted existence of windburn remains a popular and widely held misconception. Prevention and treatment The treatment of windburn is the same as for sunburn. Prevention measures involve wearing protective clothing, sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses, and seeking shade. Wind as a contributing factor There may be contributing factors of the wind to windburn, and similarly, sunburns. Most importantly, the cooling effects of the wind decrease the perception of heat and burning, meaning individuals are less likely to seek shade or to protect themselves against the sun, and are more likely to stay exposed to the burning effects of the sun's UV radiation for longer. Along with being cooling, the wind also has a drying effect on the skin, which may exacerbate the symptoms of a sunburn. There are also some claims that the natural oils and moisture in the skin are reduced in cold conditions, making the skin more vulnerable to the drying effects of the wind and the sun's UV radiation, and thus more easily burnt in situations where people may not expect to be sunburnt, such as in the snow.
