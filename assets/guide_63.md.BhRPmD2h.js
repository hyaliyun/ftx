Life and career Parveen Singh Bancil was born in Tanzania in 1967, where his mother died when he was two years old. The family moved to London. He began writing plays in 1985. =HAC period= In 1986 aged 19, Bancil joined Hounslow Arts Co-op. One of four professional British Asian theatre companies at the time, HAC was the only one to be telling stories from a 2nd generation British Asian perspective. While most were writing about partition, or leaving their homeland, Parv Bancil was writing about his world, and tackling issues that were affecting British Asian youth, such as gang culture, drugs, crime and identity. From 1986 to 1989 he wrote four plays: Curse Of The Dead Dog (1986), How's Your Skull Does It Fit (1987), Kings (1988) and Bad Company (1989). And he quickly gained a reputation as a dynamic, uncompromising and controversial writer, long before it was fashionable. He also acted in many plays, was the founder member of One Nation Under A Groove Innit, (an umbrella organization that produced comedy), was one half of a comic double act called The Khrai Twins, based on two bumbling drunken Southall gangsters, and a member of a comedy trio called the Sycophantic Sponge Bunch. He was also part of a spoof rock band called The Dead Jalebies. Formed in 1987, they toured nationally and opened for Asian Dub Foundation in 1991 at the Camden Underworld. They also supported the Voodoo Queens in 1993. =Nadir= In 1991 he was the recipient of a BBC Radio 4 Young Playwright Award for his play Nadir, about a young second generation Asian man fresh out of prison. It was produced and directed by Frances-Anne Solomon, and performed by actors Rita Wolf, Nina Wadia, Neran Persaud and Ravinder Gill. \\"I wrote a play for BBC Radio set in the near future when Britain was being run by an extreme right-wing government. Everyone had to swear allegiance to the country and if they didn't adhere to British culture they were not welcome. The BBC tried to ban it until four producers stood by me and put their necks on the line for it. The critics said it was laughable, that it would never happen. But now we have an immigration policy and people do have to swear allegiance to the flag (the so-called Britishness test where applicants for citizenship have to demonstrate a knowledge and integration of British culture).\\" =Ungrateful Dead= By this point HAC had disbanded. But in 1993 Bancil wrote Ungrateful Dead, a play about a young Sikh man's descent into a world of gangs, violence and drugs. The play had a huge impact on audiences, and lead to a residency at The Royal Court Theatre. =Papa Was A Bus Conductor= In 1995 Bancil wrote Papa Was A Bus Conductor, a comedy satire about a dysfunctional family that was an early flowering of the British Asian comedy boom that spawned Goodness Gracious Me. It was his first play to receive a TimeOut Critics Choice. And it was the first of its kind to spark a trend for a whole spate of Asian comedy that followed over the next 10 years. =Crazy Horse= Bancil's next two plays were to define him as one of the \\"In Yer Face\\" writers that dominated the 90s. In 1997 he wrote Crazy Horse. It follows Jas, a young man trying to deal with the death of his mother by losing himself in a world of petty crime, until a tragic accident forces an estranged father and son to confront each other, but with sinister consequences. It was developed through 'Wild Lunch' with Sarah Kane and was directed by Vicky Featherstone, and received another Time Out Critics Choice. =Made In England= The following year Bancil then wrote Made In England, initially commissioned as a 15-minute piece by the Red Room. It was first performed as a full-length play in October 1998. Set against the backdrop of the music industry and \\"cool Britannia\\", it looked at the idea of trading your cultural identity for success. This play received Time Out Critics Choice twice. =Later work= Bollywood Or Bust (1999) a farcical comedy, and Recall (2000), a combined dance theatre piece with Darshan Singh Bhullar, followed. The next few years saw Papa and Made In England re staged and Bancil also began to become known as a cultural commentator, writing articles for magazines and newspapers, and often contributing to radio and television debate. He also began to write and present TV documentary and venture into film and screen writing. 2007 saw another collaboration with Bhullar for Find Me Amongst The Black. And from 2008‚Äì2009 he was on an attachment with The Soho Theatre. In 2010 he had two new stage plays, Dead Leaves and Rude Boy, ready to go into production. After taking a year out to study film-making, Bancil began writing screenplays. He also became known as a cultural commentator. In 2008 he asked \\"what have multicultural arts policies done for us?\\" in a piece for The Guardian. Personal life He was married to actress Shivani Ghai. He died in London on 1 April 2017.

TRENDS in Cell Biology. 12:347-49 Early life and education Sabatini is a native of Argentina who attended medical school in Rosario at the National University of the Litoral. He began his research career at the University of Buenos Aires, in the laboratory of Eduardo De Robertis, a founder of modern cell biology, where he developed skills in electron microscopy. In 1961, as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, he traveled to the United States, first for a six-month stint at Yale University to work with histochemist Russell Barnett, and then to work with George Palade and Philip Siekevitz at the Rockefeller University. While at Yale University he introduced glutaraldehyde as a fixative for electron microscopy and cytochemistry.Sabatini DD, Bensch K, Barrnett RJ. 1963. Cytochemistry and electron microscopy. The preservation of cellular ultrastructure and enzymatic activity by aldehyde fixation. J.

Sabatini Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology Vol. 21, 2005 Academic career After finishing his PhD, Sabatini joined the faculty at Rockefeller and in his own laboratory continued studies on protein trafficking in the ER. With a group of young associates (Nica Borgese, Mark Adelman, and Gert Kreibich), collaborating with Gunter Blobel, he continued research on the mechanism that ensures the co- translational translocation and vectorial discharge of nascent polypeptides into and across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In in vitro experiments they discovered that the microsomal membrane protected the N-terminal portion of nascent polypeptides synthesized in membrane bound ribosomes from proteolytic attack by exogenous enzymes.Sabatini, D.D. and Blobel (1970).

The vegetation is mostly permanently flooded rainforest. The ecoregion is relatively intact apart from a large area that was damaged by a failed flood control program in the 1960s. It is inaccessible, so logging is difficult, and the soil is unsuitable for farming. The main threat comes from oil exploration, which would bring an influx of settlers into the delta. Location The Orinoco Delta swamp forests in the lower delta plain of the Orinoco River are one of Earth's largest intact areas of wetlands. They cover an area of . The forests extend from the base of the Paria Peninsula in the northeast of Venezuela south across the Orinoco Delta floodplain to the Waini River of Guyana. The ecoregion is bounded on the Gulf of Paria and the Atlantic Ocean by stretches of Amazon-Orinoco-Southern Caribbean mangroves. It contains sections of Orinoco wetlands. To the northwest it adjoins the La Costa xeric shrublands. To the west it adjoins the Llanos and to the south it adjoins the Guianan moist forests. Physical The terrain is flat, with typical elevations of above sea level, but in the south there are terra firme levees up to high. The soils are alluvial deposits carried by rivers from the Andes of Colombia and Venezuela. The Orinoco fans out into large and small distributaries in the delta, which wind through a landscape of permanent wetlands and marshes, oxbow lakes and levees. Climate The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Annual rainfall varies by location from , and is highest in the south. A wet season generally lasts from April/May to December. At a sample location at coordinates the temperature is relatively stable throughout the year, slightly cooler in January and July and slightly warmer in May and October. Yearly average minimum temperature is and maximum is with a mean temperature of . Yearly total rainfall is about . Average monthly rainfall varies from in February to in July. Ecology The Orinoco Delta swamp forests are in the Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. The ecoregion is part of the Guianan Moist Forests Global Ecoregion, which also includes the Guianan moist forests and the Paramaribo swamp forests. =Flora= The Orinoco delta is largely covered by permanently flooded tropical ombrophilous swamp forest, which support various endemic species of plants, with areas of wetlands, mangroves and terra firma rainforest. Most of the vegetation consists of hydrophilous trees and palms, with many epiphytes and scattered herbaceous plants. Hardwood trees include Carapa guianensis, Ceiba pentandra, Dimorphandra excelsa, Hirtella triandra, Inga punctata, Manilkara bidentata, Chlorocardium rodiei, Pentaclethra macroloba, Pterocarpus officinalis, Symphonia globulifera and Terminalia obovata. Palms, often growing in stands of one species, include Astrocaryum aculeatum, a√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea), Manicaria saccifera and Mauritia flexuosa. =Fauna= The critically endangered Orinoco crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius) The swamp forests are home to species that include Orinoco crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), jaguar (Panthera onca), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata) and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja). Endangered species include the Orinoco crocodile, giant otter and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis). Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". A flood control program in the 1960s dammed the Ca√±o Manamo, which reduced water levels in the upper delta. This part of the delta became tidal and much more saline than before, with a drastic impact on the flora and fauna. Otherwise the swamp forests are mostly intact. The highest risk now comes from oil exploration, which would bring more people into the region and cause forest clearance for food and building materials. The way of life of the indigenous Warao people would be disturbed by the newcomers. In some areas the a√ßa√≠ (Euterpe oleracea) and moriche (Mauritia flexuosa) palm trees are over- exploited. Although the region is largely inaccessible, there is growing concern about logging. The cleared land is poor quality and cannot support farming. There are two indigenous reserves, which do not provide much protection, and several conservation units. The Delta del Orinoco Biosphere Reserve is a sustainable use unit. Part of it covers wetlands. The Imataca Forest Reserve is another sustainable use unit with a portion that covers the eastern coastal wetlands. National parks in Venezuela are fully protected, and cover parts of the wetlands and surrounding ecoregions. They include the Delta del Orinoco National Park, the Turu√©pano National Park in the north of the ecoregion and the Mariusa National Park that protects wetlands along the Ca√±o Macareo.

People with disabilities and the disability community occupied federal buildings in the United States in order to push the issuance of long-delayed regulations regarding Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Prior to the 1990 enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act was the most important disability rights legislation in the United States. Background The events leading up to the 504 sit-in stemmed from the failure to enforce the legislation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Early versions of the Act were vetoed by President Richard Nixon in October 1972 and March 1973. In 1972, Disabled in Action demonstrated in New York City with a sit-in protesting one of the vetoes. Led by Judith E. Heumann, eighty activists staged this sit-in on Madison Avenue, stopping traffic. In 1972 demonstrations were also held by disabled activists in Washington, D.C. to protest this veto; among the demonstrators were DIA, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the National Paraplegia Foundation, and others. The Act was eventually signed into law in 1973. The text of Section 504 states: ‚ÄúNo otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall solely on the basis of his handicap, be excluded from the participation, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.‚Äù This means no disabled person should be excluded from any program, service, or similar which receives federal funds. Before the passage of Section 504, disability was viewed as a personal deficit and responsibility, which conforms to the medical model of disability. After the passage of Section 504, people began to understand disability as a societal problem, being disabled was not caused by the person, but rather by the construction of society, as illustrated by the social model of disability. With the passage of Section 504, discrimination of people with disabilities was legally documented. Hubert Humphrey, who worked before Section 504 to pass civil rights legislation regarding the rights of people with disabilities, said of Section 504: ‚ÄúThe time has come to firmly establish the right of disabled Americans to dignity and self-respect as equal and contributing members of society and to end the virtual isolation of millions of children and adults.‚Äù Policies surrounding the treatment of people with disabilities followed the mindset which started in the Colonial Era with laws regarding people with cognitive and psychological disabilities. The laws of that time were to protect the community from the financial burden of caring for people with such disabilities. The laws largely were in place until the American Revolution. These sorts of laws set the paternalistic mentality and stereotypes regarding people with disabilities in motion. These stereotypes of people with disabilities as being second-class citizens remained through the Civil Rights Movement and scholars argue still exist as demonstrated by the persistence of the medical model of disability. The passage of Section 504 was only the beginning of the progress needed for the civil rights of people with disabilities to be acknowledged; regulations were needed. First, the definition of disability had to be clarified, then a clear definition about what constituted discrimination regarding disability was needed, and, finally, the enforcement procedures and timelines had to be developed. Without these regulations, the courts were able to interpret the legislation of Section 504 however they preferred. The United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) was to provide the regulations addressing Section 504. Drafting regulations From the passage of Section 504 in 1973 to 1977 there were no published regulations. During these years, people with disabilities and interested parties filed a lawsuit in federal court regarding the regulations. The judge ruled that the regulations must be issued, but did not provide a deadline. Institutions that must comply with Section 504 opposed the publication of regulations. Some Office for Civil Rights attorneys drafted regulations and sent the drafts to the Secretary of HEW. The HEW then sent the drafted regulations to Congress and Congress sent the draft back to HEW. The disability community further pushed for the regulations. The American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities (ACCD) was formed and organized to push for the issuance of the regulations. After a period of public comment, the final regulations were waiting for Secretary Joseph Califano‚Äôs signature. The Carter administration took office around this time. HEW set up a task force to discuss the regulations. No disabled people were represented on the task force. The task force weakened the regulations, which meant changes in coverage and enforcement. The ACCD demanded the regulations be issued by April 4, 1977 without changes, and warned if they did not, action would be taken. A sit-in at eight HEW regional headquarters was planned for the following day if Secretary Califano did not comply. Events On April 5, 1977, activists began to demonstrate and sit-in at the HEW offices found in regions including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and Seattle. The two most noteworthy protests occurred in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The Sit-in was conceived by Frank Bowe and organized by the ACCD. The protesters demanded the signing of regulations for Section 504. There were about 300 people in Washington, D.C. who marched to and then demonstrated inside the HEW building where Secretary Califano‚Äôs office was. Although he met with a few protest representatives, including Frank Bowe, he still did not sign the regulations. This action led many protesters to continue their sit-in overnight, but they then left after 28 hours. The more successful sit-in occurred in San Francisco, planned by Judith Heumann, Kitty Cone, and Mary Jane Owen, lasted until May 4, 1977, a total of 25 days, with more than 150 people refusing to leave. It is the longest sit-in at a federal building to date. Close to 120 disability activists and protesters occupied the HEW building. = Protests across the United States = By April 1977 disability activists had grown tired of waiting. Having tried multiple options, including letter-writing, lobbying, and personal pleas, they decided to call for a national protest if Califano did not sign the regulations by April 4, 1977. After Frank Bowe, head of the ACCD, failed to convince the new administration, approximately 300 protesters in Washington, DC marched outside Califano‚Äôs house and then into his office demanding that he sign the regulations. Across the country, other people with disabilities joined in the 504 Sit-in, either picketing or occupying HEW regional offices. In addition to Washington D.C., protests took place in Boston, Seattle, New York, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and Denver. All dissipated out after officials made them disperse or waited them out. In Washington DC, protesters held out for 26 hours that included a standoff between them at Califano who climbed on top of a table to say that the regulations needed further study. In New York another six protesters had to leave due to lack of food and medications. = San Francisco 504 occupation = In San Francisco over the previous years, organizers Judy Heumann and Kitty Cone had been laying the groundwork among local organizations, community members, and people with disabilities themselves to educate them about the law and its significance. Heumann and Cone realized they needed to plan for something bigger than protesting outside in order to put pressure on regional HEW Director Joseph Maldonado who reported to his boss in Washington, Joseph Califano. They followed the lead of student activists at the time that called for occupying administration buildings on campuses across the country. Organizing an occupation that involved people with disabilities presented certain challenges that helped spur the decision to occupy. Due to the physical nature of their disabilities, and given the Federal Building's inaccessibility (one of the things that Section 504 was supposed to address), it was difficult to move large numbers of people with disabilities in and out of the building. This meant having to plan for a longer occupation in advance but without alerting too many participants so as to prevent law enforcement from barring entrance to the building. It worked in the occupiers' favor that there had never been such a large protest involving so many disabled people before. A prevailing view held that people with disabilities were pathetic and deserving of pity, and therefore incapable of such political actions. This same perspective made officials reluctant to risk a public relations embarrassment that would result from arresting participants. The day after ACCD's April 4 deadline for signing the 504 regulations had passed, over 500 disabled people and their allies attended a rally on Civic Center Plaza where various speakers addressed why Califano needed to sign them. Heumann urged the crowd to ‚Äúgo and tell Mr. Maldonado that the government cannot steal our civil rights!‚Äù Television stations and newspapers covered the initial confrontation between the protesters and Maldonado, who appeared to have no idea about the regulations or his boss‚Äôs stand in Washington. Then approximately 150 people with disabilities and their allies streamed into the Federal Building at 50 United Nations Plaza. Occupiers included people with many different disabilities. They also included many nondisabled allies such as ASL interpreters, personal care attendants, and parents of children with disabilities. The group was primarily young and racially diverse. Unlike most other major protest movements at the time (with the exception of Women's Rights), the 504 Occupation was led by women, with queer women playing an especially prominent role. They climbed to HEW regional director Maldonado's office on the 4th floor and refused to leave. Initially, HEW officials in San Francisco tried to remove them using similar tactics to those in other cities. But the large number of people, combined with the Bay Area‚Äôs atmosphere of activism and social justice, meant that the protesters had many outside allies. A number of people with disabilities had participated in the Civil Rights Movement and anti-Vietnam war protests which allowed them to understand calls for disability rights as part of the general foment of Bay Area social movements.  Support  Organizers Kitty Cone and Judy Heumann had built networks among activists for other causes and organizations, which was new for disability rights activism. Over months and years, they had cultivated relationships with groups such as the Black Panther Party, Glide Memorial Church, the Gay Men‚Äôs Butterfly Brigade, Delancey Street, the United Farm Workers, and others. The protesters also had the support of politicians that included San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, Congressmen Philip Burton, George Miller, and Senator Alan Cranston. Georgia senator Julian Bond visited the occupation. Letters of support came from Cesar Chavez and labor unions, including the International Association of Machinists (IAM). The Salvation Army provided mattresses and blankets. This outside support enabled the occupation to continue until the regulations were signed on April 28, 1977. Especially important was the help from the Black Panther Party which, in the spirit of its food programs, provided hot meals daily in support of fellow Panther Bradley Lomax and his assistant Chuck Jackson. Meanwhile, support from the Mayor‚Äôs office and from some HEW staff working in the building made life easier inside. The City brought in inflatable air mattresses and portable showers and had new pay phones installed after HEW officials in DC had ordered the lines to be cut. Outside the building, hundreds of supporters held daily vigils. This kept the occupation in public view and encouraged the protesters to hold on. A few outside supporters even decided to join those inside.  Life inside  Protesters found life inside the building for 26 days both difficult and life-changing. Because of the need to keep the occupation secret at the beginning, most arrived with only a toothbrush and necessary medications. Some people with disabilities had medical needs that required special attention such as eating and taking medications at set hours and being turned at regular intervals during the night to avoid getting bedsores. Because many had entered the building without their usual care-takers, they turned to their fellow occupiers to assist them in the tasks of daily living. Blind people became attendants to quadriplegics who in turn read printed information to the blind people. This created strong bonds among the protesters and educated them about disabilities other than their own. Occupiers found innovative ways to transform an office building into a temporary place for over one hundred people to live. For example, they used duct-tape and other materials to seal off an air conditioner in Moldonado‚Äôs office to create a refrigerator for storing medications. Committees formed that gave everyone a job related to the occupation: food, safety, clean-up, entertainment, communications/media, fundraising. Feeding such a large group was essential to keeping the protest going. Initially some people could enter and leave the building. This made it possible for them to collect donations of money and food. Major outlets such as McDonald‚Äôs and Safeway contributed in the spirit of ‚Äúhelping the handicapped‚Äù until it became clear that protesters were engaging in civil disobedience. Within the first few days members of the Black Panther Party arrived to volunteer to feed all of the occupiers, including Brad Lomax and Chuck Jackson. ‚ÄùWe support you because you're asking America to change, to treat you like human beings, like you belong,‚Äù one explained, ‚ÄúWe always support people fighting for their rights.\\" When FBI agents tried to prevent them from delivering food, the Panthers held their ground. After that, the Panthers provided hot meals each day until the end of the occupation and never asked for money. Eight of the approximately 120 occupiers who remained in the building went on a hunger strike to underline the urgency of the cause. Protesters celebrated Easter and Passover with a mass, a seder, and a hunt for eggs. When the FBI began restricting entry, occupiers convinced building guards that ASL interpreters and anyone provided healthcare needed to be free to come and go. During the many hours of boredom, protesters learned enough ASL that guards allowed some to move more freely. Thus the occupation was rather fluid. Some protesters even described sneaking off to the beach. People slept on the floor in sleeping bags and blankets that were smuggled in. Some found places under desks or at the foot of a stairway. There was an unused elevator that became a favorite place for intimate encounters. There were some issues with cleanliness, including reports of lice and crabs. Occupiers held daily meetings in one of the larger meeting rooms to keep people informed, to run the occupation, and to make plans. Because not everyone could fit, smaller networks united by disability, being from the same city, or linked by identities such as being queer sent representatives who would report back. Each committee also reported daily on what was important. Decisions were always discussed and arrived at collectively. Care was taken to make sure that each person felt their voices had been heard. Communicating with the outside world was challenging in an era before computers, cell phones, and fax machines, especially when HEW officials ordered the office phone lines to be turned off. The building‚Äôs few pay phones quickly filled with coins as the phone company stopped coming to collect them. The occupiers became resourceful. In addition to unfurling banners out the windows, they used Deaf people inside the building to transmit messages in sign language through windows on the fourth floor to other interpreters outside on the street below. They used this way so that press releases got out into the public and occupiers got news of the outside world. To pass the many hours of boredom waiting inside an office building, occupiers played cards, sang, held wheelchair races, and talked late into the night. Friendships and intimate relationships formed. Occupiers, some who had never spent time away from home before, were meeting other people with the same and different disabilities to their own. They argued and bonded and discovered people with a common sense of purpose. They also gained confidence. One young woman filmed during the occupation said, \\"I used to know what I would wish for. I wanted to be beautiful. I wanted to stop being a cripple. But now I know I am beautiful.\\" Summing it up later, another participant explained: \\"It didn't matter if you were mentally retarded, blind or deaf. Everybody...felt, We are beautiful, we are powerful, we are strong, we are important.\\"  \\"The Hearing\\"  As the occupation dragged on, organizers sought ways to keep morale up and media attention focused on the protest. Ten days in, they came up with the idea of working with representatives Philip Burton and George Miller to host a day- long hearing in the building so that protesters could educate America about the plight of people with disabilities. The sympathetic politicians declared the 4th floor of 50 UN Plaza ‚Äúa satellite office of Congress,‚Äù which brought television and newspaper reporters. As cameras rolled, dozens of protesters testified on one of several panels related to specific disabling conditions: blindness, deafness, addiction, and others. In a highly public way, people with disabilities were educating Americans about low employment rates, housing discrimination, lack of educational opportunities. During the hearing a low- ranking HEW official sent from Washington let slip that Califano was considering making twenty-two changes to the 504 regulations. These included eliminating rules that would require hospitals and schools to provide ramps and other features for access as well as setting up special schools for disabled children rather than keeping them in mainstream schools. The official used the term \\"separate but equal,\\" a fact that made them even angrier and strengthened their resolve. Disability rights leader Ed Roberts - then head of the California State Department of Rehabilitation and who visited the occupation regularly - condemned this solution, stating: \\"Integration is the key word: people with disabilities have to come back into our society.\\"  Some San Francisco protesters go to Washington, DC  Two weeks into the occupation, protest leaders realized that in order to succeed, they would need more national attention. Twenty-five people reflecting racial and disability diversity were elected to travel to the nation‚Äôs capitol where they planned to meet with groups on the east coast and put more pressure on politicians. The IAM helped raise money for airline tickets and for travel once the protesters were in Washington. In these early days of the disability rights movement, it was hard to find accessible transportation, public or private, for people who used wheelchairs. This meant they had to travel in the back of a dark U-Haul truck that had a cargo lift. They slept on the floor of a church. In Washington, protesters had meetings with congressional representatives, a challenge at a time when many federal buildings - including the Capitol - were not accessible for people in wheelchairs. They also held candle-light vigils outside the wealthy suburban home of HEW Secretary Califano where they sang ‚ÄúSign 504‚Äù to the tune of the Civil Rights Anthem ‚ÄúWe Shall Overcome.‚Äù. They even protested outside of President Jimmy Carter‚Äôs church, but Carter slipped out the side door. Another day, they held a large rally in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House that attracted hundreds of supporters. Conclusion Califano signed the regulations on April 28, 1977. This protest was significant not only because its goal was achieved, but also because it was the foremost concerted effort between people of different disabilities coming together in support of legislation that affected the overall disability population, rather than only specific groups.

It does not require weights, although they can be placed on the stomach. Steps There are four steps in the exercise. *The person lies on their back with knees bent * They slowly raise their buttocks and pelvis off the floor as high as possible * Hold position * Repeat Benefits The pelvic floor is a \\"broad sling of muscles, ligaments and sheet-like tissues that stretch from your pubic bone at the front of your body, to the base of your spine at the back\\". The pelvic floor is resistant to stretch and weight as it bounces back. However, after carrying weight for long periods of time, it can become stretched. Additionally, weight on the pelvic floor can weaken its resistance and contribute to its loss of shape over time. Performing this exercise routinely can strengthen glutes, abs, and lower back muscles. As a result, doctors may recommend pelvic lifts to reduce lower back pain, improve posture, and improve bladder control.

Development  The album takes a casual easygoing approach that marries Brickell's laid-back songs with the skills of the seasoned session professional musicians. The album consists of a certain amount of improvisation. The first song, a one- minute tune called \\"Meat on Your Bones\\", was spontaneously written and recorded, setting a tone of not taking the recording of the music too seriously for the first few songs, aiming for loose, spontaneous, and inviting, creating a playful band dynamic. Gadd, who is the de facto bandleader, reports that the song creation process has Brickell creating songs, and the rest of the band develop the ideas, inspiring music of the others. Brickell reports that the band transforms the song into something with a lot more personality than she had conceived. Brickell found that working with The Gaddabouts inspired a joy of music creation because instead of playing a song 50 times, with the seasoned crew they could develop the song they wanted in one take, keeping everything as live as possible in the studio.

G√¢teau nantais is a soft, round pound cake, made of flour, sugar, salted butter, eggs, and almond meal, then dampened with a punch of rum and lemon, sometimes with an apricot gel√©e centre. The round shaped cake top is topped with a white glaze thinned with rum, although lemon or orange blossom water can be substituted if the cake is to be served to children. It is recommended to make the cake a day before it is intended to be served. It keeps very well. An earlier version of the recipe, without eggs, reportedly kept for three to four weeks. In the modern recipe, the icing is white, whereas earlier versions were an amber colour. A cookbook from the 1890s called for lemon peel to be grated into the cake's batter. The batter was firm enough to be stretched with a rolling pin and cut into rounds with a dough cutter. This version used a sprinkling of almond meal and sugar as a topping for the cake prior to cooking, and did not call for rum. In the 18th century, the port of Nantes was enriched by the triangular trade and saw many goods from the Caribbean colonies such as cane sugar, dark rum, and vanilla; ingredients that were later used in the composition of the Nantes cake. Because of this, it is sometimes called the \\"traveller's cake\\". It is considered a regional speciality of Nantes. Columnist says it was created in 1820 by a Roleau, master baker of Nantes. This \\"high-end\\" dessert was once served by housewives to their guests. It fell somewhat into oblivion until its revival by the biscuit factory LU, from 1910 to 1972. In the late 1990s, LU gave their recipe to Gilbert Debott√©, who managed the Debott√© patisserie. Since it became popular again in the 20th century, pastry chefs and cooks in Nantes have served it in its most classic version, or have been inspired to create variants including additional ingredients.

History In 1975, the state of New York passed the State Environmental Quality Review Act to better establish a process when looking to add new developments on a site. From 1976 to 2005 there have been alterations to the Changes or Applications and Amendments categories. Who Must Apply This applies to any group that is deciding to approve a funded sponsored action through private or public financials. These groups include the following; * Authorities * Special Boards * Districts * Local Government * State Government Any project or action classified under Type I has to follow SEQRA requirements. A Type I action is any class of actions that unavoidably is going to have significant impacts on the environment. Enforcement There is no one agency that has the power to enforce SEQRA. The formation of the legislation enables it to be self- enforcing. The agencies responsible for an action that falls under SEQRA requirements must under its own power meet these regulations. The regulations that are issued are provided through the Department of Environmental Conservation. Do Not Apply If the project is listed under the statewide and agency SEQRA regulations are listed under the Type II list then it is determined not to have a large impact on the surrounding environment. Type II actions are classified as the project not having any significant impacts on the surrounding environment, or actions that have been exempted from SEQRA reviews.  Satisfying Requirements  When going forward to satisfying the SEQRA requirements there is an 11 step process that you need to follow. Step 1 Is the action being taken subject to SEQRA. If yes then it needs to be classified as a type II Action or Type I Action. Step 2 The correct environmental assessment form needs to be completed and reviewed. Step 3 A coordinated review is set up by all agencies involved in Type 1 Actions. Step 4 This is the step where the agency that is taking the lead will make its determination on the significance. Step 5 The preparation of the draft EIS is started by the lead agency or the applicant can. Step 6 The lead agency that received the draft EIS has 45 days to review and see if it is the draft is adequate for public review. Step 7 The publishing notice that the EIS has been accepted for the public review. Step 8 After the notice of complete of the EIS a public comment period then begins. Step 9 A debate on weather a public hearing should be held. Step 10 This is where the lead agency is held accountable for checking the precision on the final EIS statement. This should be finalized 45 days after the final hearings or 60 days after the filing of the draft EIS. Step 11 The final step is involves each agency writing their own SEQRA findings statement for that project. This has to be completed after the final EIS statement and before the final decision the agency makes. Findings certify that the project has met requirements of Part 617. Critical Areas These are specific geographical areas that local agencies can deem Critical Environmental Areas (CEA). To designate an area to this stand it mus have one of more of the following characteristics ; # a threat or benefit to human well being # a natural setting that includes things such as areas of important aesthetic or scenic quality, wildlife habitat, and vegetation. # values that include agricultural, cultural, archaeological, historic, or educational # Essential geological, ecological, or hydrological sensitivity that can be altered by any change around it.

It was first published in late 1903, both in the United Kingdom and in U.S.A. Some of the poems were new; some had been published before (notably \\"Recessional\\", of 1897), sometimes in different versions. Description In 1903, the United Kingdom consisted of four nations: England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It was soon suggested that Kipling's \\"five nations\\" were the \\"five free nations of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa [i.e. Cape Colony], and 'the islands of the sea' [i.e. the British Isles]\\" ‚Äîall dominated by Britons; and except in the last case, by recent settlers. That suggestion was endorsed some one hundred years later. No author seems to have suggested that the \\"five nations\\" included India which, as the British Raj, was the basis of Britain's claim to imperial greatness.

Association (also known by its Swedish name, F√∂reningen JA!) is an art collective based in Sweden. The collective was founded in 2005 and continues to be active today. The collective creates art through the use of enactments and performances. The YES! Association is known primarily for art exhibitions that deal with themes of gender, sexuality, race, and capitalism.  Formation  The YES! Association was founded in 2005. It originated out of an art exhibition entitled ‚ÄúArt Feminism - strategies and effects in Sweden from the 1970‚Äôs until today‚Äù. Responding to a perceived lack of equity in Swedish public art institutions, members of the YES! Association proposed a document, dubbed the ‚ÄúEqual Opportunities Agreement‚Äù. The YES! Association used their live work ‚ÄúPress Conference /Performance‚Äù, a part of the broader exhibition, to provide art institutions with the opportunity to sign the agreement. Institutional signatories would have committed to engage in concrete actions to increase diversity and equity, particularly through the use of quotas. If it had been signed by the art organizations the agreement would have been legally binding. However, no institutions present at the time agreed to sign the document.  Key figures  The YES! Association is composed of original founding members and newer participants. Founding members include * Malin Arnell, a feminist artist whose work engages with concepts of intimacy and power. * Johanna Gustavsson, an artist whose work focuses on pedagogy. * Line S. Karlstr√∂m, an artist with a focus on the interplay of power and identity. * Anna Linder, a feminist artist known for her work in moving images. * Fia-Stina Sandlund, a Swedish artist known for feminist art films. Other members of the collective over the years include: * √Ösa Elz√©n, an artist whose work focuses on post-colonial and intersectional feminist theory. The YES! Association has collaborated with artists and institutions including Melanie Cervantes, Regina Jos√© Galindo, Gluklya, Victoria Lomasko, Pauline Boudry/Renate Lorenz, Liza Morozova, Tanja Ostojic, Mujeres P√∫blicas, Bureau of Melodramatic Research, and Anna Zvyagintseva. In addition, The YES! Association has received support from the Swedish Arts Council through the IASPIS program, facilitating collaborations with queer artist Lee H. Jones.  Themes  Artistic works by The YES! Association have predominantly dealt with themes of gender, sexuality, race, and capitalism. Drawing on the feminist activist roots of the artists making up the collective (see above for an overview of Key Figures), exhibitions have investigated the role of women and other equity seeking groups in both the art world and society more broadly. In these works, several sub-themes emerge: = Equity and diversity in art = The founding work of the YES! Association was an activist call for accountability and increased diversity in Swedish public art. Since the 2005 work ‚ÄúPress Conference /Performance‚Äù, the YES! Association has used a variety of platforms such as radio interviews, panels, and articles to argue that contemporary art must do a better job of representing equity seeking communities. In particular, the YES! Association has used the exploration of notions of privilege and oppression to illustrate divides in the art world. = Intersectional feminist theory = The YES! Association‚Äôs artwork has repeatedly come back to investigations of intersectional modes of feminist art. In particular, the collective has focused on the benefits and drawbacks of knowledge that is based on categories. Through their work, the YES! Association has challenged the utility of binaries, making a feminist argument for a more intersectional understanding of identity. Their work rarely looks at ‚Äòwomen‚Äô as an isolated category, opting instead to include considerations such a class, race, and sexuality, as well. = Hannah Arendt = Political theorist Hannah Arendt has been cited as both a theme and inspiration in the work of the YES! Association. A Jewish-American thinker, Arendt was born in Germany and fled Europe during the Second World War. Her work dealt largely with systems of power, particularly political hierarchies such as totalitarianism. A noted woman theorist in a field dominated by men, Arendt is often held up as an example of feminist excellence (though she herself may not have used the label ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù). The YES! Association has created works that drew on Arendt‚Äôs commitment to the spread of ideas and conversation. The collective has also collaborated with associations devoted to the memory of Arendt, such as The Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities at Bard College. = Notable works = The works of the YES! Association have taken a variety of forms but commonly include aspects of performance and dialogue.  ‚ÄúPress conference /performance‚Äù, 2005, Performance.  For the piece, members of the YES! Association put forward a document entitled the ‚ÄúEqual Opportunities Agreement‚Äù. The document aimed to legally bind Swedish public art institutions to uphold quotas to improve diversity. The performance was executed in the Dunker Culture House.  \\"(Dis)agreements? ‚Äì the utility, effectiveness, and problematics of categories.\\" 2010. Performance, a video, an agreement, a teach-in, and a letter.  The work used a video and teach-in discussion to consider diversity in art institutions. The work took place at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art of Brooklyn Museum.  ‚ÄúSMOKING AREA‚Äù, 2012, Floor Painting.  ‚ÄúSMOKING AREA‚Äù paid tribute to political theorist Hannah Arendt. The work used a floor painting made with yellow paint to create a designated space where viewers/ participants could come, smoke, and discuss ideas. The floor painting aimed to further the aims of Arendt, whose work argued for the power of friendship and dialogue. The work was hosted by the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College.  ‚ÄúI am talking about something happening right here, right now‚Äù, 2012, Discussion.  This work operated as a discussion with Lee H. Jones. Using an activist framework, the discussion centered around the interplay of institutions and labour. The work was funded by IASPIS. = Notable Exhibitions =  \\"Art Feminism ‚Äì Strategies and Consequences in Sweden from the 1970s to the Present\\", 2005.  This was the first exhibition that the YES! Association participated in. The Dunker Culture House served as the host institution. The YES! Association performed their work ‚ÄúPress Conference /Performance‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe Privilege Walk/Symposium ‚Äì Feminist and intersectional aspects of contemporary art‚Äù, 2008.  The exhibition operated as a symposium held over the course of a weekend at the Lilith Performance Studio in Malmo, Sweden. Components included lectures, film screenings, performances, and workshops. Thematically, the exhibition focused on the Swedish art movement and persisting equity concerns.  ‚Äú(art)work(sport)work(sex)work‚Äù, 2015.  The exhibition was hosted by the Power Plant in Toronto, Canada. The work was commissioned in conjunction with the 2015 Pan Am games. It considered the three fields of art, sport, and sex work.

Early life and career  Tremblay grew up in Seneca, Missouri, a rural community near Joplin, Missouri. In 2007, she moved to Lincoln, Nebraska. While there she wrote, produced and starred in Tiny Red Universe, a short film which aired on IFC. In 2012, she released Heartland: A Portrait of Survival. The film documents the effects of the 2011 Joplin tornado which destroyed a quarter of the city and caused about $2.8 billion worth of damage. Tremblay, who was living in Los Angeles at the time but had previously lived in Joplin, had relatives still living in her hometown. She traveled to the town with a film crew and documented the aftermath for a four-week period. The film, which features several stories like the Joplin Found Photos project, was shown at the Omaha Film Festival, and at St. Louis International Film Festival. In 2014, Tremblay released In the Turn, a documentary film that revolves around a ten-year-old transgender girl from Timmins, Ontario. The film began as a Kickstarter project to profile the Vagine Regime, \\"a queer roller derby collective,\\" in a documentary film. Tremblay received a message from Crystal's mother that recounted the negative experiences her daughter has had in asserting her gender identity and how she is unable to participate in a sports because of this. Tremblay, who herself identifies as queer, decided to refocus the documentary around Crystal. In 2016, Tremblay was awarded a National Artist Fellowship at the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation.

Mauriziano (1811-1878) was a respected merchant, part of a family originally from Sampierdarena (S. Petri ad Arenaria) where the Palazzo Centurione- Carpaneto still stands.Marchetti, Rita Nello (2014). Caterina e l'Angelo: Il volto popolare e l'anima nobile del Cimitero di Staglieno.

After school, he worked as a shop-boy in a joiner's workshop in Sampierdarena, where Scanzi met him. Later, he started his own workshop, becoming a successful carpenter and wood carver. Symbolism The sculpture depicts an angel, standing astride a small boat, beginning to secure the sails at the end of a journey. His garments are streaming behind him, suggesting a strong wind. The prow of the boat is the stoic face of a woman, and under the prow the water swirls. Ropes are coiled in minute detail inside the boat (even though the average cemetery visitor would not be able to see them), and at the back of the boat is an embroidered cushion, slightly dented from a head resting there until a moment earlier. dearmissfletcher.wordpress.com/, retrieved 25 June 2017 The boat would be a familiar symbol to anyone in 19th century Genova‚Äîa seaport town‚Äîand the Angelo Nocchiero - Angel Helmsman - reminds the viewer of the spiritual boatmen of ancient mythology, whose job it was to transport the departed into the afterlife.

The class is named after US Army Staff Sergeant Michael Ollis, a Staten Islander who was killed in action during the War in Afghanistan in 2013. History Early work on the class began in August 2014, after a study into the future of Staten Island Ferry's fleet showed that the most economical course would be new-build ships instead of rebuilding existing vessels. The Elliott Bay Design Group was awarded a contract to design the new ships, which will replace and , resulting in one additional ship in the Staten Island Ferry fleet. The following month, substantial funding for the project, covering the construction of two ships, was secured with a $191.6 million federal grant from the Hurricane Sandy relief bill. As part of the new order, city officials allowed passengers to vote on the types of seats that would be installed in the new fleet. In November 2016, Eastern Shipbuilding was confirmed as the low bidder for constructing the ships, and the shipyard was awarded the contract with a notice to proceed on March 1, 2017. The final price for construction of the three vessels was $314 million; in addition to the federal grant, state and city funding was also used. The first vessel, , was expected to be delivered in mid-2019, followed later that year by , named after an early African American settlement on Staten Island. The as-yet-unnamed third vessel would have been delivered in 2020. A petition to name the third Ollis-class ship after Staten Island firefighter John G. Chipura, who died in the September 11 attacks, reached 11,000 signatures by September 2017. Other proposed namesakes include Russel Timoshenko, an NYPD officer killed in the line of duty in 2007. In October 2018, the timeline for the ferries' delivery was pushed back. Some of the parts for the first two Ollis-class ferries were being manufactured at Eastern Shipbuilding's shipyard in Panama City, Florida, which had been severely damaged after Hurricane Michael that month. MV Michael H. Ollis was launched in November 2019, with an expected delivery date of August 2020. MV Sandy Ground was launched in June 2020.

Geography According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the community has an area of ; of its area is land, and is water. History  Before being established as Crystal Beach, the land was originally owned by the Washburn family, who maintained a large grape farm. In 1929, Paul Ritchie, owner of Finger Lakes Company, purchased the farm and the subsequent land. He began planning a large housing development in the area. The company built a grid of roads, and dedicated land for neighborhood parks. 965 30 ft x 80 ft lots were built for housing. Midway through building the new cottages at Crystal Beach, the Great Depression hit, and all development seized. Many of the homes built after the Great Depression were built by non-professional individuals, which is why we see a large variation of style and quality of homes in the Crystal Beach area today. In 2016, the mean price of all housing units was $267,468. Public Parks * Deep Run Park **Deep Run Park is Carry In/Carry Out park that is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day.

As a stained glass artist, she was a disciple of stained glass designer, Selwyn Image. Newill was a member of the Birmingham Group, an informal group of artists and craftsment that worked in Birmingham, England. Biography Mary Jane Newill was born in Shropshire, England in 1860. She studied at the Birmingham School of Art in the 1880s and 1890s. Fellow students included Charles March Gere, Sidney Meteyard, and Henry Payne. Awarded a John Skirrow Wright scholarship in 1880, Newell continued her studies in Paris. She returned to Birmingham and was hired to teach embroidery and design at the Birmingham School of Art in 1892, a position she occupied until 1919. In 1893, Newill's Babes in the Woods stained glass panel cartoon was displayed at the annual Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in London, only the second stained glass design by a female artist to be exhibited, and the first by a woman who later became a successful commercial artist. The drawing was later used by Christopher Whall as an illustration in his influential manual, Stained Glass Work (1905). Newill's drawings are similar to her mentor, Selwyn Image's work. \\"Although her subsequent stained glass work developed in interesting and original ways, it always retained echoes of Image's graphic simplification in the drawing.\\" Newill had her own studio in central Birmingham by 1906, at a time when there were few women working in the profession. She was a designer for the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts and a member of the Birmingham Group and of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. Most of Newill‚Äôs stained glass work was commissioned and purchased for private residences. Two public examples of her work are a window in the lady chapel of St. Mary and St. Ambrose Church in Edgbaston, and a window in the Wrockwardine Church in Shropshire. Embroidery by Newill and her students was displayed at the International Exhibition of 1906 in Christchurch, New Zealand. Some of her embroidery projects were commissioned for churches. Examples of her needlework are held in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

The black and white ‚Äúmurder mystery-melodrama comedy‚Äù stars James Kirkwood Sr., Madge Bellamy, and ZaSu Pitts. It was adapted from the play The Nightcap written by Guy Bolton and Max Marcin.

A partial 16mm print exists in a private collection, missing the original opening credits and three scenes from the ending. A complete copy of the film was rediscovered by Richard Scott in his basement, a former Winnipegger now living in Mississauga, Ontario. Scott's father used to work at the Eatons department store in Winnipeg; the store had offered a film library, but shut it down in the 1940s and got rid of its stock. His father brought home 15 films and a projector. The films then sat in a box in Scott's basement for 30 years before being rediscovered in early 2017. Upon discovery, Scott contacted the L. Jeffrey Selznick School of Film Preservation at the George Eastman Museum in Rochester, New York, about the films. Museum staff put him in touch with a media archivist at the University of Toronto, who went to Scott's home and picked up the box films to examine back at the school. After a few weeks, the University got back to him; they were going to restore and digitize all the films. The newly restored Secrets of the Night was then screened for Scott and 100 guests at the University of Toronto in March 2017, with a pianist providing the soundtrack.

Vila was an individual linked to design, to aspects of decorative comfort, to pictorial work, but from the training of architecture and above all, in cultivated sensitivity that formed in the roots of his family life. After his early training in painting with Rafael Arzeno, he took up an artistic career at an art course at the University of Puerto Rico and graduated as an architect at the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. He also attended the American University and the √âcole Am√©ricaine des Beaux-Arts in the Palais de Fontainebleau in France. He died on April 1, 2005 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.  Architectural development  Miguel Vila Luna was officially introduced during the so-called \\"twelve years of Balaguer\\", from 1966 to 1978, which mark the Dominican territory an unavoidable stage in the development of national architecture and urbanism. Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, former president of the country, was able to choose well, at this stage, his architects. The list of outstanding projects designated for several specific architects is long and plentiful. Miguel Vila led a new style among Dominican professionals, in which he dedicated himself to the discipline of including landscaping in buildings. After Balaguer's two reelections, his control over the architecture was reduced. In addition, the interactional architectural scene changes drastically. A new generation of postmodernity arises including architects such as Miguel Vila, Pl√°cido Pi√±a, Te√≥filo Carbonell, Angel Giudicelli, Oscar Imbert, Gustavo Luis \\"Cuquito\\" Mor√©, T√°cito Cordero, among others. In those years, Miguel Vila, with his unequaled leadership among the youngest architects, produced a series of private works that imposed part of the aesthetic guidelines of postmodernism. Vila, whose work began in the early 1970s under the laws of modern architecture, gradually penetrated the study of regional architecture to his enthusiastic attachment of historicist architecture, from where he developed multiple proposals that produced a whole environment of innovations in the national scenario.\\"Convocan a su IX Bienal Internacional de Arquitectura de Santo Domingo.\\" El Nuevo Diario. Llego la hora del arquitecto, 10 Sept. 2008. Web.http://www.elnuevodiario.com.do/mobile/article.aspx?id=119205. Convinced of the aesthetic strength of architecture as a key element for a better quality of life, Miguel Vila developed particular work for space and formal capacities, which was advanced for his era. This became references for the architects of the period which reproduced his criteria of integrating architecture with the exterior. The sequence, spatial categorization, and wealth of decorative resources were set by Vila as motivators for the coexistence. His treatment of the walls in which he rejected the edges and framed the gaps were part of his language, which was used for a whole generation. His followers became, later, protagonists of architecture committed to tropical solutions. Mor√©, Gustavo Luis. Historias para la construcci√≥n de la arquitectura dominicana, 1492‚Äì2008. Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic: Grupo Le√≥n Jimenes, 2008. Print. Since its inauguration, Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic has undergone significant changes in its original concept of architecture. The designs of Miguel Vila, Roberto Copa, William Cox, Rafael Eduardo Selman, Jose Horacio Marranzini and his son Alejandro have been important in its development.  Artistic style  In 1963, his pictorial works appeared in the XI National Biennial. In 1979, Micky recorded his first exhibition which was held in Paris, in the Ives Brun gallery. He headed a movement with the poet Manuel Antonio Rueda Gonz√°lez that offered the following traits: a plurality of readings of the work, active participation in the spectator's interpretation, inseparability of color and form, integration of universal and local elements, and motivations to the plastic and psycho-philosophies. His artistic movement of futurism was rich in followers. His works resemble futurism and are bountiful in brilliant compositions of color and movement.Santos, Danilo De los.

Their style was influenced by the orfeones which grew popular in northern Spain in the mid-19th century, and their popularization in the island was linked to the emancipation of African slaves in 1886. The common instrumentation of the coros featured a viola (a string-less banjo used as a percussion instrument), claves, guitar, harp and jug bass. History =Background= During the 19th century, the Cuban government only allowed black people, slaves or free, to cultivate their cultural traditions within the boundaries of certain mutual aid societies, which were founded during the 16th century. According to David H. Brown, those societies, called cabildos, \\"provided in times of sickness and death, held masses for deceased members, collected funds to buy nation-brethren out of slavery, held regular dances and diversions on Sundays and feast days, and sponsored religious masses, processions and dancing carnival groups (now called comparsas) around the annual cycle of Catholic festival days.\\" Brown, David H (2003). Santer√≠a Enthroned. The University of Chicago Press: Chicago, IL. p. 34. At the cabildos in the town of Trinidad some choral groups existed since mid-19th century that performed the so called tonadas trinitarias. There are some references that by 1860, the tonadas trinitarias were interpreted during the local festivities by choirs from different neighborhoods, which used to gather together to compete while they paraded through the streets.Fr√≠as, Johnny: Notes to the CD Tonadas Trinitarias. Conjunto Folkl√≥rico de Trinidad. EGREM LD ‚Äì 4383. Also within the cabildos of certain neighborhoods from Havana, Matanzas, Sancti Sp√≠ritus and Trinidad, some choral groups were founded during the 19th century that organized competitive activities, and in some occasions were visited by local authorities and neighbors that gave them money and presents. Those choral societies usually were named after their neighborhoods, and in some occasions they counted with one hundred or more members. Most probable of their chanting aimed to distract local authorities from investigating the real purpose of their gatherings, which was to celebrate ritual activities related to their original African religions.Veitia, H√©ctor (1974). Tonadas Trinitarias. =Development= The origin and development of the coros de clave is linked not only to the local cabildos, but also to the traditions imported by immigrants from northern Spain, in particular the similarly named coros de Clav√© (after Catalan composer Jos√© Ansemlo Clav√©). Starting in 1845, Clav√© established orfeones (French-style choirs) made up of working-class people in Barcelona. Similar choral traditions spread throughout the north of Spain, including Galicia, where the movement was called . According to some authors, including Odilio Urf√© and Ned Sublette, upon introduction in Cuba, the coros de Clav√© lost their accent, becoming coros de clave. The coros de clave became popular in Cuba between the 1880s and the 1910s. They comprised as many as 150 men and women who sang in 6/8 time with European harmonies and instruments. Songs began with a female solo singer followed by call-and-response choral singing. As many as 60 coros de clave might have existed by 1902, some of which denied any African influence on their music. Examples of popular coros de clave include El Arpa de Oro, La Juventud, La Generaci√≥n and Flor del D√≠a.D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal: Discograf√≠a de la M√∫sica Cubana. Editorial Corripio C. por A., Rep√∫blica Dominicana, 1994, p. 122. From the coros the clave evolved the coros de guaguanc√≥, which comprised mostly men, had a 2/4 time, and incorporated drums. Famous coros de guaguanc√≥ include El Timbre de Oro, Los Roncos (both featuring Ignacio Pi√±eiro, the latter as director), and Paso Franco. Some scholars such as Argeliers Le√≥n nonetheless argue that the coros de clave and coros de guaguac√≥ evolved independently of each other. The coros de guaguanc√≥, which were considerably more africanized, gave rise some of the first authentic rumba groups, particularly guaguanc√≥ groups. Nonetheless, guaguanc√≥ also had its roots in another rumba style known as yamb√∫, which itself derived from the Bantu yuka genre. Some rumba groups such as Clave y Guaguanc√≥ and Grupo Afrocuba de Matanzas carried part of the coros de guaguanc√≥ repertoire into the late 20th century. Musical characteristics The coros de clave share their name with the percussion instrument used as accompaniment, the Cuban claves, which execute the main rhythmic pattern, the vertical hemiola (also characteristic of the contradanza). The vertical hemiola constitutes the most essential element of the sesqui√°ltera rhythm, and consists in the practice of superimposing a binary rhythmic pulse over a ternary one, as follows: Vertical Hemiola. The accompaniment of the choirs frequently included a guitar and the percussion was executed over the sound box of an American banjo from which the strings were removed, due to the fact that African drums performance was strictly forbidden in Cuban cities.Sublette, Ned: Cuba and its music. Chicago Review Press, Inc., 2004, p. 264. Usually a soloist started a song by singing a nonlexical melody and also improvised variations of the themes sung by the choir. A participant called \\"censor\\" was dedicated to supervise the language utilized in the songs.Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 54. Clave genre The musical style of the coros de clave, and particularly its rhythm, gave rise to a popular song genre called clave, which most probably served as the original prototype for the creation of the criolla genre.Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 60. Both genres, the clave and the criolla, became very popular within the Cuban vernacular theater repertoire.

Life Born at Richmond, Surrey on 5 August 1760, he was the only son of Basil Woodd (1730‚Äì1760) and his wife Hannah (died 12 November 1784), daughter of William Price of Richmond. He was educated by Thomas Clarke, rector of Chesham Bois in Buckinghamshire, and matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 7 May 1778, graduating B.A. in February 1782 and M.A. in 1785.

In 1646 it was owned by Thomas Hutchinson (MP) and occupied by Lady Hutchinson, mother of Colonel Hutchinson. The front was reconstructed in 1728-33 for William Hallowes. Alterations were made in 1742, and it was again remodelled in 1833 when it was converted into the Judges' lodging by the architects Henry Moses Wood and John Nicholson. For a brief period in 1887 it was lived in by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. The lodgings had to be specially furnished for her stay at the expense of the Mayor of Nottingham. In 1922 it was then converted to County Council offices, with additions in 1930. Two adjacent properties, 17 and 19, were demolished in 1931 to provide car parking for the court opposite. There were further additions to County House in 1949. It housed the Nottinghamshire County Record Office from 1966 to 1992.

Around 150 S√°mi people gathered at the assembly from Norway and Sweden. 6 February has since become the S√°mi National Day. The S√°mi Assembly of 1917 was the first S√°mi National Assembly. The S√°mi who took part in the assembly were from both Norway and Sweden. The meeting was held at the Methodist Church in Trondheim from 6 to 9 February 1917. The S√°mi National Day is celebrated on 6 February to commemorate the beginning of this assembly. Around 150 participants gathered at the assembly, of which the majority consisted of Southern S√°mi from Nordland, Tr√∏ndelag and Hedmark. Elsa Laula Renberg (1877‚Äì1931) from Helgeland and the S√°mi Women's union at Brurskanken initiated the assembly. Renberg was the assembly's chairwoman and gave the opening speech at the meeting. The other major S√°mi leader at that time, Daniel Mortenson from R√∏ros/Elg√•, was also a chairman and gave a lecture at the assembly about reindeer farming and how it had become hampered by the Joint S√°mi Act (\\"Felleslappeloven\\") of 1883. The lecture sparked a debate that led to the forming of a separate committee concerning reindeer farming by the assembly. The committee later presented a proposal for a new reindeer farming act, which influenced the final shaping of the law in 1919. The other main issue at the assembly was the demand for a separate S√°mi school, where children were taught and allowed to write in the S√°mi language.  Background  Elsa Laula Renberg (1877‚Äì1931) was a reindeer herder in the Brurskanken mountains south of Mosj√∏en. She was the assembly's initiator. The picture was probably taken in 1916 as part of the promotion for the assembly. Daniel Mortenson from Elg√•/R√∏ros was one of the most active S√°mi politicians at that time. He was a reindeer herder, edited the newspaper Waren Sardne, took part in establishing several S√°mi organizations, and was elected as chairman for this assembly. Painting by Astri Aasen. In the years preceding the assembly, S√°mi people in both Norway and Sweden felt that their culture and livelihoods were threatened. Therefore, in the years 1904-1910, both S√°mi organisations and journals started to arise. = Territory restrictions and Norwegianization = The Joint S√°mi Act of 1883 was the first major attempt by the authorities to \\"gain control of the Sami's reindeer herding\\". The law applied to both Norway and Sweden, and established territories for reindeer grazing. The law introduced the principle of collective liability for all shareholders in the reindeer grazing territories for damages inflicted by the reindeer on the local agriculture. In 1894, the boundaries for reindeer grazing were established, yet important grazing areas such as Trollheimen and Gauldalsvidda fell outside these boundaries. With the Supplementary S√°mi Act of 1897, landowners received the right to prohibit reindeer herding outside of the reindeer grazing territories. Prescriptive rights and common law were thus disregarded. However, the legal regulation of reindeer herding was in constant motion, and several commissions worked on the reindeer herding question up until the next reindeer herding act came in 1933.Jernsletten (1991) In Sweden, the \\"limit of cultivation\\" had given S√°mi nomads the right to use grazing land in the areas of the country that were situated above rural communities. These territories, however, were eventually adopted by new settlers, a process that has been characterized as \\"rural colonization\\", so that the reindeer herds were pushed away from the known grazing areas. The S√°mi's liability for reindeer damages remained however. Questions of territory and grazing rights were particularly a problem in the Southern S√°mi areas. In the Northern S√°mi areas of Troms and Finnmark, the biggest challenge was Norwegianization, within \\"schools, industries, the church, defense and intelligence - often in a close (and intimate) relation\\". The pressure was particularly directed at S√°mi in \\"transitional districts\\" in coastal areas and remote fjords.Otnes 1970; p. 129 A part of this was due to the school governor not wanting S√°mi teachers to teach in S√°mi villages where they could \\"be to the detriment of their S√°mi knowledge\\"; they should therefore be sent to non-S√°mi villages. Outside of Namsos, the S√°mi school in Havika had started in 1910 as a boarding school for children from Southern S√°mi families; the school was in many ways a \\"Norwegianization school\\", but was also a meeting place for the S√°mi. The S√°mi missionary organisation was founded in 1888, and from the beginning, made a conscious effort to use the S√°mi language. After national assembly resolutions in 1912 and 1913, the organisation adopted into its bylaws that \\"the organisation should in no respect be in violation of the State's work concerning the church and schooling\\". This was interpreted as supporting the Norwegianization effort.Borgen (1997), p. 11‚Äì25 In Sweden, the authorities, through a school reform in 1913, had split S√°mi children into two groups, the so-called \\"category splitting\\": children of reindeer herding S√°mi went to \\"the Nomad school\\", whilst children of non-nomadic S√°mi went to regular schools, where they lost their S√°mi identity. This was called \\"Lapps should be Lapps\\" politics, where \\"real S√°mi\\" were defined in a way that ostracized large groups of S√°mi. The question of reindeer herding across the border between Norway and Sweden had been a difficult topic during the Karlstad Convention. From ancient times, the Sami reindeer herders placed little emphasis on national borders, and had let their reindeer graze in Sweden during the winter and in Norway during the summer. Through the Lapp Codicil of 1751, this tradition was regulated by contract between the countries.Eventually, as a majority of these Sami became Swedish citizens, grazing and reindeer herding rights from Sweden became a burden for Norway. During the negotiations of 1905, it was thought this cross-border reindeer herding included 80,000-100,000 Swedish reindeer in Troms and Nordland, and in comparison there were only 7000 Norwegian reindeer grazing in Sweden during the winter. During the Karlstad Convention, this was finally resolved so that Norway accepted the grazing rights from Sweden, but was curtailed so that reindeer migration had to occur after June 15, six weeks later than previous regulations.  Lectures and discussions at the assembly  There were four key issues on the assembly schedule: reindeer grazing, legislation, schooling, and organisation issues. In addition, there was a lecture on tuberculosis, a slide show lecture by reindeer herding officer Kristian Nissen about \\"Sami and reindeer in Norway\\", and a historical lecture by \\"Headmaster Prytz\\" about the R√∏ros S√°mi, emphasising the assault on the S√°mi at Dalbusj√∏en in 1811. The programme also included a civic reception, a dinner at the Trade Association, theatre visits, and a tour of the cathedral. The assembly was conducted in Norwegian, partly due to Norwegian-speaking guests, and partly due to the difference between the Northern S√°mi and Southern S√°mi languages. Johan Roska apologised during the discussions that one could not use their own language at the assembly. = The question of reindeer herding = Marie Finnskog from R√∏ros was emissary and took part in the assemblies of both 1917 and 1921. During the discussion on the Joint S√°mi Act, she gave a longer contribution where she said that \\"the right to own land and grazing territories belonged to the S√°mi, who were in fact the country's first settlers\\". Painting by Astri Aasen. Johan Roska from Nesseby. Roska advocated that a S√°mi newspaper should be started. Painting by Astri Aasen. Mortenson held the lecture on reindeer herding. The topic was discussed in relation to the \\"domestic relationships\\" and the \\"international (Norway/Sweden) relationships\\". The discussion on domestic relationships concerned first and foremost the loss of grazing land as a result of the farming of new land and other expansions in agriculture. Furthermore, grazing damages and compensation procedures for this were discussed, in addition to the distrust between the S√°mi and the farmers/villagers. Mortenson argued for a more business-orientated meat production in reindeer herding, with larger herds of reindeer. Renberg disagreed; she \\"maintained that the key condition is rational herding, whether it is about milking or producing meat\\". \\"Allow those Sami who want to produce meat to do so, but also allow us with herds of approx. 100 reindeer the right to live according to the old Sami way of life\\". Mortenson was also concerned about a recent Supreme Court ruling on grazing rights and compensation in R√∏ros that had gone against the S√°mi there. The international relationships concerned the question of grazing across the border between Sweden and Norway. The assembly agreed to a resolution where it was requested that the common law of free grazing would be maintained, and that the State had to buy or expropriate new grazing land to substitute grazing land that was now built upon. Changes in the rules concerning compensation for grazing damages caused by reindeer were demanded. They also wanted to changes to the rules regarding the sale of unmarked reindeer; such that the profits from this in the future could go to common S√°mi causes. Lawyer Ole Tobias Olsen jr. from Mosj√∏en also attended the assembly and was active in the discussions about herding laws, in addition to that, he was one of the keynote speakers on the topic \\"legislation\\". Olsen had worked together with Renberg earlier, and was chosen as legal consultant to the committee that would work on the question of reindeer herding further. The others on the committee were Thomas Renberg (Elsa Laula Renberg's husband) and Nils Kappfjeld from Helgeland, Nils Andersen Nursfjeld and Per Larsen Jomafjeld from Nord-Tr√∏ndelag, and Johan Barrok and Mortenson from S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag. This committee met again in Mosj√∏en a few weeks after the national assembly, and delivered in 1919, a separate proposal for a new reindeer herding law. = Legislation = Lawyer Olsen and the Swedish jurist Torkel Tomasson introduced the legal issues. Tomasson discussed the Joint S√°mi Act and highlighted several instances that \\"did not form a harmonious relationship with the Sami's interests\\"; he also said that the internal agricultural colonization \\"had deprived the Sami one right after another\\". He also criticised the provisions that regulated reindeer migration between Sweden and Norway, and thought that these were both contrary to the nature of the reindeer and common law. Olsen discussed the rules concerning compensation for grazing damages caused by reindeer; the current practice was often that the damages were assessed with prejudice by the affected farmer's neighbours and friends. The same farmers and their friends also sat in on the full bench trial, thought Olsen. In the discussion after these lectures, the damages inflicted on reindeer by the villagers' stray dogs was also cited. The discussion on herding and legislation were closely linked, and took up most of the time at the assembly. The resolutions dealt with these issues together. = Organisation issues = To initiate the establishment of a S√°mi organisation, Martin Tranm√¶l, former editor of the Trondheim newspaper Ny Tid, had been invited to the assembly. He recommended a structure with regional associations, municipal associations, and a nationwide association or a Scandinavian union. Johan Roska from Nesseby advocated that a S√°mi newspaper should be started. He thought that it should be published in Norwegian, whilst Gunnar Johnsen Vesterfjeld from Helgeland thought that such a newspaper could be written in both Norwegian and S√°mi. The committee formed to draw up a proposal for a new reindeer herding law were also asked to consider the organisation issue. = Schooling = A high priority during the assembly was the demand for a separate S√°mi school, and that children had to be taught in the S√°mi language. The issue was introduced by a lecture from the Swedish Nomad School-inspector, Vitalis Karnell, who gave an account of the new school system in Sweden. However, the assembly felt that this solution was not relevant in Norway. The discussion was otherwise marked by criticism of the S√°mi school in Havika, criticism that was concerned with both practical and principle questions. After the common assembly was ended on Friday, and in line with the Friday discussions, a special meeting was held on Saturday 10 February concerning schooling.. Sanna Jonassen from Fosen/Namsos had initiated this meeting. The discussion concluded with a resolution that was attached to the minutes of the assembly. It was demanded that \\"the State should be obliged to provide S√°mi education while retaining the S√°mi language in the schools, with S√°mi overseers and teaching of such subjects, which are necessary for the S√°mi to know if they want to be able to exist as reindeer farmers\\".\\"Protokoll Norske lappers...\\" (1991) The resolution points out that this should be arranged in different ways in Southern S√°mi and Northern S√°mi regions, given that in Southern S√°mi areas, the S√°mi kept on settling down there. It was also felt that it was the State, and not the S√°mi missionary organisation, that should have responsibility for education. = Two factions during the assembly = An impression that there were \\"two factions\\" during the assembly has attached itself to the meeting, an impression that was established in Adresse Newspaper's report from the assembly in the same week. Later historiography has alternated between minimizing this point, and highlighting it. Mortenson and Renberg were regarded as leaders of each faction. The two had experiences of different forms of reindeer farming. In R√∏ros, Mortenson had already in 1902 begun to shift from intensive reindeer herding nomadism to extensive meat production. Renberg's grazing district in Helgeland belonged to the part of Southern S√°mi reindeer herders who were the last to give up the close nomadic life with the reindeer. Mortenson argued for a modernization of reindeer herding. \\"Thus, there were representatives of two different herding methods that met, with somewhat contrasting interests in relation to what they wanted to achieve with regard to the revision of the reindeer herding laws. Mortenson wanted reindeer husbandry to be integrated into Norwegian society and wanted a law that would fit accordingly. Renberg was deeply rooted in the traditional, nomadic reindeer herding and was keen to preserve S√°mi values and traditions\\". Mortenson was not concerned with S√°mi education in schools either. Renberg had a starkly contrasting view. This view has been described as a \\"special demand\\" from Renberg's side, and a \\"general demand\\" from Mortenson's side. It was clear during the assembly that government representatives preferred general, unspecified demands. Nissen succeeded in rejecting a draft resolution from the two Finnmark S√°mi on the grounds that it concerned \\"special interests\\".  Notes  References .

History The museum was founded in 1991 as the Children's Museum of Snohomish County, as part of a countywide initiative to establish children-oriented places in Snohomish County by the county government's Children's Commission. It opened in 1993 at a storefront in nearby Marysville, but was forced to move to a temporary space in downtown Everett in 1995. The county government planned to locate the museum permanently at McCollum Park in Mill Creek, but plans fell through during the late 1990s, leading to a donation by the Schack family to fund a permanent museum in downtown Everett. The new $4.75 million museum, a former Everett Mutual Bank branch with of space, opened on October 17, 2004, and was renamed the Imagine Children's Museum. In its first year at the expanded location, the museum reported an attendance of 146,000, more than quadruple its annual attendance at its temporary locations. In 2020, the museum announced plans for a four-story expansion that would add in the southern parking lot. The expansion project, which would cost $25 million, is planned to open in 2022 and include exhibits on woodland habitats, a puppet theater stage, and an outdoor construction crane. Exhibits and programs The Imagine Children's Museum is designed as an activity center for children between the ages of one and twelve years, with over 20 exhibits. Some of the exhibits are reflective of life in Snohomish County, including a child-sized airplane cockpit, a bus donated by Everett Transit, and a theater stage. The museum's rooftop was converted into an outdoor playground in 2005, including a two-story wooden tower, climbing wall and other play areas.

The pigmented bar can either contain red pigment (phaeomelanin) or black pigment (eumelanin) whereas the apigmented bar is always white. The locus is therefore often referred to as an ‚Äòeumelanin diluter‚Äô or ‚Äòmelanin disruptor‚Äô. Typical sex-linked barred breeds include the Barred Plymouth Rock, Delaware, Old English Crele Games as well as Coucou de Renne.  Plumage appearance  The presence of a white bar on a dark background is distinguishing sex-linked barring from Autosomal barring, another plumage pattern in chickens which is created by a black bar on a light color background (white/ beige or brown) as exemplified by the breed Egyptian Fayoumi. The absence of pigment in the white bar has been attributed to a lack of pigment producing cells (melanocytes) in the feather follicle during feather growth. Initially it was proposed that this lack was the result of cell death as a consequence of the B locus mutation but later research demonstrated that the lack is the result of premature cell differentiation rather than apoptosis. Male chicken of traditional sex-linked barred breeds like the Barred Plymouth Rock usually show much wider and clearer white bands than females of the same breed. Further characteristics of sex-linked barred chickens are the dilution of skin pigment in the legs as well as a white dot at the top of the head of freshly hatched chicks which can be used for autosexing: homozygous males have a much bigger spot than hemizygous females.  Genetics  Sex-linked barring has been established as the dominant locus B by traditional mendelian genetics in the beginning of the 20th century. The responsible gene was predicted to be located on the Z chromosome and since male birds are homogametic (ZZ), they can be either hetero- or homozygous for sex-linked barring. Females are always hemizygous at this locus (ZW). In 2010 Swedish scientist have identified four mutations located in or around the tumor suppressor locus CDKN2A, which appear to be associated with sex-linked barring. The four mutations are organized in 3 different alleles named B0, B1 and B2. All alleles carry two non-coding mutation located in regulatory regions of the gene (the promoter and intron) but only B1 and B2 carry two additional missense mutations in a functional important domain of the protein. The B1 allele is causing the typical sex- linked barring phenotype/ appearance and is present in most modern sex-linked barred chicken breeds. Females or male chickens carrying the B2 allele in the heterozygous condition show a defined barring pattern but in the homozygous condition, males are essentially white with very little pigmentation. This phenotype has been initially described as a distinct but closely related mutation, however, it was later assigned to the same gene and termed ‚ÄòSex- linked Dilution'. The B0 allele only carries the two non-coding mutations and its contribution to the barring pattern remained unknown as it only occurred in breeds that also carry the Dominant white mutation which is masking the effect at the B locus.). Recently scientists have removed the Dominant white mutation from chickens of those lines and were able to show that those chickens show a very light barring pattern. They named the phenotype ‚ÄòSex- linked Extreme Dilution‚Äô. As chickens with the B0 allele show the weakest barring pattern compared to those that have the coding mutation in addition, the scientists propose an evolutionary scenario in which the non-coding mutations occurred first and the two missense mutations later in time and independently. As only the combination of both non-coding and missense mutations give the desired and pronounced barring pattern, B0 alone is not present in modern Sex-linked barred breeds anymore.  Molecular pattern formation in the feather follicle  Scientists were able to show that either both or one of the non-coding mutations present in all B alleles, cause an up- regulation of the activity of CDKN2A. ). With more of the gene product, which is called ARF (Alternate Reading frame Protein) in the cell, more of p53 is protected from degradation. p53 is a transcription factor which in turn activates more genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. As a consequence the cell stops dividing and starts to prematurely produce pigment. The missense mutations in the B1 and B2 allele, however, have an opposite effect. Both missense mutations lead to a malfunctioning ARF protein, which is counteracting the effect of the higher activity of the gene to some degree. The premature production of pigment is still obvious but less strong as observed in the B0 allele. It is intriguing that the missense mutation in the B1 allele is much more disruptive for the protein function than the one in the B2 allele and the scientists believe that this is the reason for the observed phenotypic differences between those two alleles. When the melanocyte progenitor cells start to migrate up from the bottom of the follicle into the barbs where they will make pigment, they further divide until a sufficient number of pigment cells is achieved. As a consequence of the up-regulation of CDKN2A, most cells will stop dividing and make new cells but instead start producing pigment- a black bar is emerging from the feather. But eventually, there will not be enough pigment cells anymore. As they are recruited from the bottom of the feather follicle, the feather keeps on growing, creating the white bar. With the new set of pigment cells, the cyclic behavior starts again, creating alternating pigmented and apigmented bars.  Sex-linked barring mutations and melanoma  Mutations in CDKN2A have been associated with the occurrence of familial melanoma in humans. Changes in its gene product ARF often cause the cell to lose their ability for self-induced cell death or cell cycle arrest, which are mechanisms of cells to manage uncontrolled cell divisions and therefore the occurrence of cancer. It is intriguing that chickens carrying the B1 or B2 allele with a malfunctioning ARF do not show any higher prevalence to any type of cancer and are usually considered very sturdy and easy to keep breeds. It is also astonishing that the majority of the egg and meat production industry is relying on chickens, which have a defect in a tumor suppressor gene.

She was sunk in 1942 by a German U-boat. Construction Acacia was laid down by Fabricated Shipbuilding Corporation and Coddington Engineering Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the mine planter USAMP General John P. Story, for the U.S. Army, sometime around 1 October 1918. She was named for Major General John Patten Story, Chief of Artillery 1904‚Äì1905. She was launched on 15 September 1919 and was delivered around 1 May 1920, then commissioned into the Army's Mine Planter Service at Milwaukee. Service history =Army ‚Äì transfer to the Lighthouse Service= Acacia was a mine planter, USAMP General John P. Story, originally built for the U.S. Army in 1919. Although intended for the Coast Defenses of Pensacola, Florida, she never served there. Transferred in November 1920 to the Army Supply Base, Brooklyn, New York. Transferred in April 1921 to Fort Totten, New York in the Coast Defenses of Eastern New York. Transferred in August 1921 to Fort Monroe, Virginia in the Coast Defenses of Chesapeake Bay. The ship was decommissioned on 10 November 1921. Six vessels of this type were transferred to the U.S. Lighthouse Service at no cost in 1921‚Äì1927 and redesignated as Speedwell-class lighthouse tenders, also functioning as buoy tenders. The original intent was for these vessels to serve a dual purpose: mine planter in case of a war, and lighthouse tender during peacetime. Unfortunately, this conversion proved to be impracticable and too expensive and they were modified exclusively for service as tenders at a cost of between $41,022 to $110,963. Each had a turtleback forecastle installed and their anchors were mounted high to prevent the ship from being hung up on a buoy she was servicing. A steel main deck was added forward; new windows were installed in the pilothouse, and a new refrigerating plant was added. All vessels were then commissioned from 1923 to 1927 with new names. =Lighthouse Service and Coast Guard service= Acacia was assigned to the San Juan, Puerto Rico, area 21 April 1927. The ship‚Äôs field of operations included Puerto Rico and adjacent islands, Virgin Islands, Guant√°namo Bay, and Cuba. Although the ship was designated as a lighthouse tender she was also used to perform construction and repair of stations, small structures, piers, etc. in addition to her work of tending aids to navigation. After the San Felipe hurricane on 13 September 1928, the crew nicknamed themselves \\"The Acacia Construction Company\\" because of the number of repairs they performed. She ran aground off Fajardo, Puerto Rico, in September 1932, during a hurricane, probably the San Ciprian hurricane, but was safely refloated. The ship's main mission was in to place and repair aids to navigation equipment, in which they maintained approximately 255 during her time in service. The crew supported shore lights, unwatched lights, lighted buoys, unlighted buoys and beacons, and radio beacons on both the Panama Canals Atlantic and Pacific sides, the western Caribbean, Morro Puercas and the Jicarita Island Lights. In addition, Acacia rendered numerous salvage services involving vessels and persons in distress. The most notable was the rescue of the Brazilian training ship Almirante Saldanha. The vessel and its crew were given up for lost after the ship had run aground off San Juan Harbor Entrance 25 July 1938. Acacia rescued her crew, and the rescue created a celebration in Brazil and gained the attention of international officials. In June 1938, Boatswain Ora Doyle took command of the tender from Master John A. Anderson, who transferred to command . In late 1939, Acacia and the cutter towed the seized Italian tanker Colorado, which had its engine room damaged through sabotage by its interned crew, from San Juan to Galveston, Texas for repairs, one of the longest towing operations in Coast Guard history to that time. Sinking On 15 March 1942, from 11:37 until 12:11, while en route alone from Cura√ßao, Netherlands West Indies to Antigua, British West Indies, Acacia was sunk by gunfire from the as part of Operation Neuland approximately south of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The U-boat opened fire on the unarmed tender with 68 rounds from her /45 caliber deck gun, 92 rounds from her /83 caliber anti-aircraft (AA) gun, and 70 rounds from her /65 caliber AA gun. Acacia caught fire and the entire crew of Acacia abandoned ship before she sank by the stern. The survivors were located by a PBY \\"Catalina\\" and picked up by . They were landed at San Juan 16 March 1942. She was the only U.S. buoy tender sunk by enemy action during the war. Acacia sank at , about southwest of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

Like many lobopodians, it had nine pairs of lobopods (legs). It was well adapted to filter-feeding and probably did so from the nearest high vantage point.  Morphology  Ovatiovermis had nine pairs of lobopods. The first two pairs were elongate and had approximately 20 pairs of spines on each lobopod, with a bifid claw at each tip. The third to sixth pairs of lobopods were shorter and their paired spines were much smaller. On these four pairs of lobopods the spines were only large near the tip. The last three pairs of lobopods did not have the paired spines, showing that these spines were used for filter-feeding. Instead these lobopods had hooked claws with which it could grip one of the corals or sponges found at the time and rear up into the current. At the anterior end of the animal it had an evertible proboscis, with its mouth at the end. This would probably have been used to suck any particles of food which had been caught off the spines, possibly in a similar manner to a sea cucumber. Its head was not well separated from the body. Also on the head Ovatiovermis had two small (0.1mm diameter) and probably very primitive visual organs. Close examination of the fossils revealed traces of calcium compounds in the claws of the back three legs and around the mouth and proboscis. There were also calcium traces found in the gut, but this may have been fragments of shell attached to its food rather than the animal\`s organs.  Etymology  Ovatiovermis comes from the Latin 'ovatio' 'I clap' and 'vermis' 'worm'. This refers to the position it would have adopted when filter-feeding, standing on its rear pairs of lobopods and waving front limbs above its head. cribratus also comes from Latin, and means 'that which sieves'.  Evolutionary importance  Ovatiovermis was a member of the luolishaniid group of lobopodians. Caron and Aria, in their article on Ovatiovermis, suggest that luolishaniids, hallucigeniids and superarthropods (Arthropoda, Tardigrada and Onchyophora) all form the Panarthropoda superphylum, rather than hallucigeniids and luolishaniids being closely related to onchyophorans. This pushes the date for this splitting well back into the Precambrian. All luolishaniids were filter-feeders, and this is one of the characteristics that they are classified by - the other is the small head and thick neck, unlike in hallucigeniids which had a bulbous head and a thin neck.
