It is a rounded, densely branched, small shrub with thin red branches and scattered small leaves. The flowers are arranged in small groups on the ends of the branches, their most obvious feature being long, red, pointed bracts surrounding each flower and a longer red style with scattered hairs near its tip. Description Scarp darwinia is a densely branched, glabrous, rounded shrub growing to high. It has thin red branches with the leaf bases having wings that extend down the stems. Its leaves have a petiole less than long, and a leaf blade long, linear in shape and triangular in cross-section. The tip of the leaves is sharply pointed. The flowers are arranged in groups of 4 to 8 near the ends of the branches. The groups of flowers are surrounded by narrow egg-shaped, pointed bracts up to long. The bracts are green, yellowish or yellow and red. The petal lobes are about long and , enclosing the stamens, staminodes and the lower part of the style. The style is red and long with scattered hairs near its tip. Flowering occurs during October or November. Fruit rarely forms but is a nut containing one or two seeds. Taxonomy The first formal description of D. apiculata was published by Neville Marchant in 1984 in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (apiculata) is a Latin word meaning \\"small-pointed\\" alluding to the distinctly pointed leaves. Distribution and habitat This darwinia is currently only known from three populations in the Darling Scarp where it grows in jarrah-marri woodland in shallow, gravelly soil or sandy loam over laterite near granite boulders. Ecology Scarp darwinia is killed by fire but regenerates from seed stored in the soil. Its pollination mechanism is not known but similar darwinias are pollinated by insects or birds. Some Darwinia species are susceptible to dieback disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, but initial trials suggest that this species may be resistant. The main threats to the remaining populations include too- frequent fires, road and firebreak maintenance, weed invasion, illegal rubbish dumping and mining. Conservation Darwinia apiculata is classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and an Interim Recovery Plan has been prepared. It has also been listed as \\"Endangered\\" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) \\"due to the severe fragmentation of populations and continuing decline in the number of mature individuals.\\" References apiculata Endemic flora of Western Australia Endangered flora of Australia Myrtales of Australia Rosids of Western Australia Plants described in 1984 ","title":"Darwinia apiculata"},{"id":"51547106","text":"Hickcox is a surname.

Druga Prikazna), is an annual three-day literary event, taking place in Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia. The name of the festival refers to the idea of affirming the local and global faces of otherness in culture and literature. At its inauguration in 2016, the festival's topic was ‚ÄòLiterature and Activism‚Äô, and was inspired by the ‚ÄúColorful Revolution‚Äù protests in the county. Origin and history The inauguration of the festival corresponded with the mass protests, organized by the civil sector in Macedonia, against alleged corruption within the country's political elite. The idea behind the festival is to \\"harvest\\" the creative energy from the street protests and transform them into artistic expressions of the desire for democratization and emancipation. Another objective of the festival is to popularize literature and culture, both of which, according to the organizers, have been quite marginally maintained in the country due to a widespread poverty and poor cultural demand. Themes Dragan Protiƒá and Nikola Gelevski at the festival The phrase ‚ÄòAnother Story‚Äô, selected as a name of the festival, aims at affirming the otherness in culture and literature, as well as of the many faces of local and global otherness. The main message of the Another Story Festival is tolerance and the desire to create another, different kind of Macedonia - one more open and accepting towards to diversity. The main subject of Another Story is short fiction, however, the festival also covers hybrid literature forms, as literary forms that combine written word with music, graphics, media, theory, etc. Guests Every year the festival gives out a grand prize. In 2016 the winner was David Albahari, a renowned Serbian Jewish writer from Belgrade.

She spent decades working with the neurons of Aplysia californica, studying post-synaptic nerve response. She discovered that one neurotransmitter can have multiple types of receptors, which could vary in level and type of response. Kehoe worked for the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, where she has made many other discoveries in neuroscience.  Early life  JacSue Kehoe was born on October 23, 1935 in Cleveland, Ohio. Her mother was a former doctoral candidate turned English teacher. Her father was an employee of the Chrysler Corporation. The youngest of three, Kehoe and her family moved to Evansville, Indiana for the duration of World War II for her father‚Äôs work. After the war they migrated back to the city, where Kehoe discovered her interest in the performing arts. She became assistant to the dramatic arts teacher at her high school: this position inspired her to become a theater director. She attended Northwestern University to pursue a degree in theater. After two years pursuing her theater degree, she switched her major to experimental psychology. Human behavior was a major interest of the field. Kehoe performed experiments testing memory for her honor‚Äôs thesis. After two years she graduated Northwestern with a bachelor's degree in experimental psychology. Kehoe continued her education at Brown University. She focused on the function of the nervous system and its relation to psychology, furthering her understanding of human memory. She performed experiments concerning the proactive and retroactive inhibition of memory retention on pigeons, earning her Ph.D. in 1961.  Career  Kehoe joined the psychology faculty of Brown University, before moving to Washington, D.C. to continue her research. As a postdoctoral fellow at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research she furthered her study of discrimination learning in pigeons, rats and squirrels and became increasingly focused on the physiological basis of behavior. In a nearby lab Felix Strumwasser was using neurons from Aplysia Californica, a species of sea slug, to study circadian rhythms. These cells were ideal for studying the effects of neurotransmitters on neuron behavior: using discarded Aplysia ganglia and equipment provided by Strumwasser‚Äôs lab, Kehoe began her study of synaptic physiology. In 1964 Kehoe moved to Paris to continue her work on Aplysia at the Institut Marey. She began experimenting to identify the neurotransmitter that brought about postsynaptic potentials (PSP). Attempting to use curare, a Cholinergic antagonist, to this end, she observed instead a change in the cells' spontaneous synaptic activity. This activity was unusual, so she refocused her research on this hyperpolarizing response for several years. After many tests using a setup of her own design Kehoe discovered that methyl- xylocholine, an Adrenergic neuron blocker, inhibited the K-dependent response she had found in the cells. This was unusual, as the Aplysia response she was researching was cholinergic and was not expected to change with the addition of an adrenergic inhibitor. From this data Kehoe determined that both the adrenergic and cholinergic responses she observed involved the same receptor. She determined that multiple receptors for a particular neurotransmitter could be found on a neuron, each receptor could change the conductance of the neurotransmitter in a different and independent manner, and that the postsynaptic response could vary from cell to cell. Kehoe then took a position as a full-time researcher at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (C.N.R.S.). In 1968 she and Philippe traveled to Cambridge on sabbatical, where they continued their research. Kehoe worked under Gabriel Horn in the anatomy department, who arranged for her to be admitted to High Table at King's College. At the time High Table was all male‚ÄîKehoe was the first visiting female academic to be granted access. In the same year her husband Philippe accepted a teaching position in Paris, so that they could operate their own lab. Upon their return from Cambridge they were given space for their lab at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. Over the following summers Kehoe also acted as an instructor at a research program in the United States. Working under Harvard University‚Äôs James Watson at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory she taught courses to Harvard students with an interest in neuroscience research. Kehoe continued to travel the world, giving seminars and conferences on her discoveries, as well as performing her own experiments. She continued her research to identify the neurotransmitters used in Aplysia, turning her attention towards glutamate receptors in the late 20th century. In 2002 she and Philippe gave up their lab to other researchers, and moved their research to the lab of their colleagues, Alain Marty and Isabel Llano, in another part of Paris. As of 2017 Kehoe continued researching neurotransmitters and their effects.  Personal life  In 1967 Kehoe married fellow researcher and French native Philippe Ascher. In the fall of 1968 she had her first son David. Her second son Ivan was born after she began working at Cold Spring. Until her death, she has spent most of her life in Paris with her husband and their two children.

He was acclaimed by his fellow Dubliners as a hero for his decisive victory over the O'Byrne clan of County Wicklow at the Battle of Bloody Bank in 1402.O'Byrne Irish Independent 18/4/2012 He was a member of the prominent Drake family of Drakerath, County Meath, who were a junior branch of the wealthy English landowning Drake family of Ash, Devon. Sir Francis Drake is said to have belonged to another branch of the same family, although this has been disputed. John was a close relative, possibly a son, of Richard Drake of Drakerath, who was High Sheriff of Meath in 1385, and he was probably the John Drake who held the same office in 1422. Matilda (or Maud) Drake, who married the eminent judge Sir Christopher Bernevall, was a close relative, possibly a sister, of John.Ball The Judges in Ireland Battle of Bloody Bank Drake was elected Mayor of Dublin for the first time in 1401. In the summer of the following year the O'Byrnes, who periodically raided Dublin, moved a large force of mercenaries to the banks of the River Dargle at Bray in County Wicklow, about twelve miles south of Dublin city. There they remained for some days, being apparently uncertain which way to proceed. This fatal hesitation gave the Walsh family, who owned nearby Carrickmines Castle, time to warn the authorities in Dublin of the impending raid. O'Byrne Drake, who seems to have been given sole power to deal with the emergency, acted quickly and decisively: he assembled a large and well-armed force of Dublin citizenry, assisted by the fighting monks of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. His forces fell on the mercenary camp at the Dargle, and defeated them with heavy loss of life.O'Byrne The casualties on the O'Byrne side were so high - one estimate puts the death toll on their side at 4000 - that the area became known as Bloody Bank, and was so called until the nineteenth century.O'Byrne The outcome of the battle did much to enhance the security of Dublin and the Pale (the counties adjoining Dublin). At the same time it greatly weakened the power of the O'Byrnes, who were forced to acknowledge the authority of the English Crown, and to surrender the key fortress of Newcastle MacKynegan, near present day Newcastle, County Wicklow.O'Byrne Drake's popularity was greatly enhanced by his victory at Bloody Bank, and he served three terms as Mayor in all, finally stepping down in 1412. A thanksgiving ceremony to celebrate his achievements was held at Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin in 1402. Drake was the first Mayor of Dublin to carry the city's ceremonial sword and mace, which were gifts to the people of Dublin from King Henry IV of England. Reputation Although he was a hero to the people of Dublin, Drake was regarded in quite a different light by the O'Byrnes, who maintained that the \\"battle\\" at Bloody Bank was actually an unprovoked massacre, since they had not attacked nor intended to attack Dublin (although what else they meant to do with such a large army is unclear). They did not forget or forgive him: a much later ballad composed by an O'Byrne descendant referred bitterly to Drake as the general who slaughtered hundreds of innocents at the Dargle.

However, the rail gap between Kotri and Multan was considered a hassle as the Indus River and Sutlej River were major obstacles to cross at the time. In 1871, the Indus Valley State Railway was inaugurated and construction began on extending the railway line from Multan south towards Bahawalpur (crossing the Sutlej River) and on wards to Rohri.

William Hamilton, FRSE, MRIA, FSAS (1755-1797), was an Irish Protestant minister, geologist, meteorologist and antiquarian, killed by a mob due to his pro-British views. His book, Letters Concerning the North Coast of Antrim, was pivotal in the vulcanist understanding of the history of the planet and was translated into several languages.The Chronologer‚Äôs Quest, Patrick Wyse Jackson He founded the group, the Pal√¶osophers, which together with the Neosophers, later merged to create the Royal Irish Academy. Life He was born on 16 December 1755 in Derry in Ulster, Ireland, the son of John Hamilton, a merchant. He studied at the University of Dublin, graduating BA in 1776. In 1779 he was granted an MA and also made a Fellow of the University. In 1788 (apparently during a visit to Scotland) he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Walker, Adam Smith and James Hutton. In 1790 he was appointed Church of Ireland Rector of Clondavaddog (sometimes called Faust) on the Fanad Peninsula on the north coast of County Donegal in Ulster. The parish lies on the shores of Lough Swilly. In this role he acted as both clergyman and local magistrate, and in the latter represented the views of the British authorities, and caused increasing friction with some of his parishioners and with the local Catholic community. This came to a head in 1797. In February, his parsonage was attacked and he sought (and received) an armed military guard from the county. On 2 March he took a boat trip on Lough Swilly and bad weather caused him to divert to the small hamlet of Sharon Glebe, near Manorcunningham. Here he took shelter in the house of Dr Waller, a friend. However, the locals learned of this and took advantage, Dr Waller‚Äôs house not being as well guarded as the minister‚Äôs. The mob outside threatened to burn the house down. When Dr Waller‚Äôs wife was shot and killed whilst looking down on the crowd from an upper window, the servants could stand it no more. They forcibly ejected The Rev. Hamilton out of the house, where he was instantly killed by the angry mob. The servants hid behind the locked door and on opening it in the early hours of 3 March found the corpse of the unfortunate minister still lying there. The action was an important precursor to the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and typified the anti-establishment feeling within the Irish community. Whilst Hamilton was wholly Irish, his pro-British stance was no longer being tolerated. He left a wife and nine children. He is buried in Derry Cathedral.

Interindividual (differing from person to person) variability is usually regarded as a source of noise for research. However, in recent years, it has become an interesting source to study sensory mechanisms and understand human behavior. With the help of modern neuroimaging methods such as fMRI and EEG, individual differences in perception could be related to the underlying brain mechanisms. This has helped to explain differences in behavior and cognition across the population. Common methods include studying the perception of illusions, as they can effectively demonstrate how different aspects such as culture, genetics and the environment can influence human behavior. Optical Illusions =Bistable Motion= A motion quartet is a bistable stimulus - it consists of two dots that change their position from frame to frame. This position change can either be interpreted as horizontal or vertical movement by viewers, and this experience can switch during viewing between interpretations. Depending on the aspect ratio of the two dots' positions, one or the other state is perceived longer or more often. At an aspect ratio of one, the illusion is biased towards the vertical perception. The reason for this might be the way the human brain processes the signals from both eyes in the visual system. The right half of an eye's field of view is processed by the left hemisphere, and the left half by the right hemisphere. A stimulus moving vertically only involves one field of view and so one hemisphere, while a stimulus moving vertically from one field of view to the other involves both hemispheres, and requires communication between them. The delay caused by this additional signalling might be the cause for the bias. There are also individual differences in the way the motion quartet is perceived: Some people require a different aspect ratio to perceive both axes of movement than others. A study using diffusion tensor imaging further showed differences in the structure of the corpus callosum, the primary connection between the two hemispheres, might be the origin of these differences. =Object size estimation= There exist a variety of illusions that make objects appear bigger or smaller compared to their real size. Two such illusions are the Ebbinghaus and the Ponzo illusions. The Ebbinghaus illusion makes a dot seem bigger because it is surrounded by smaller dots, while the Ponzo illusion exploits human perspective processing by making a dot appear bigger because it seems farther away. Schwarzkopf et al. found that the size of the primary visual cortex (V1) has an effect on the magnitude of these illusions. The larger the subject's V1 surface area was, the less the subjects fell for the illusion. This is hypothesized to be due to the fact that a larger V1 dedicated to the same portion of the visual field means a lesser effect of later, fixed-size visual areas (which are the ones that are responsible for the illusion effect). Auditory Illusions =McGurk Effect= The McGurk effect is an auditory illusion in which people perceive a different syllable when incongruent audiovisual speech is presented: an auditory syllable \\"ba\\" is presented while the mouth movement is \\"ga\\". As a result, the listener perceives the syllable \\"da\\". However, according to Gentilucci and Cattaneo (2005), not everyone perceives this illusion; only about 26% to 98% of the population are susceptible to this illusion. One of the psychological models that explains the interindividual differences in speech perception is the fuzzy logic model of speech perception According to this model, a categorization process is carried out when processing speech sounds. When listening to a stimulus, the features of the acoustic signal are analyzed. Subsequently, this signal is compared with the features that are stored in the memory; finally the sound is classified into the category that best fits. However, this classification may have a blurred boundary respectively to the category which the sound belongs to. As a result, the final decision may depend on integration of multiple sources of information. When the McGurk effect is presented the auditory and visual components of the speech are separately evaluated before being integrated. In those who perceive the McGurk effect, the visual information has a higher influence on the perception of the ambiguous audiovisual information and thus the sound is classified as \\"da\\". Many studies have concluded that the area responsible for the perception of this phenomenon is the left superior temporal sulcus(STS). This area is critical for the multisensory integration of visual and auditory information during speech perception. Moreover, there is a correlation between the activation of the STS and the perception of the McGurk effect. In that sense, if the left STS correctly integrates the mismatched audiovisual information, a McGurk effect is perceived; if the left STS is not active, the visual and auditory information are not integrated and thus a McGurk effect is not perceived. In one study blood-oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) was used to measure the brain activity in perceivers and non- perceivers of the McGurk effect while presented with congruent audiovisual syllables, McGurk audiovisual syllables (auditory \\"ba\\" + visual \\"ga\\" producing perception of \\"da\\"), and non-McGurk incongruent syllables( auditory \\"ga\\" + visual \\"ba\\" producing auditory perception of \\"ga\\"). The researchers found that there was a positive correlation between the amplitude of response in the left STS and the probability of perceiving the McGurk effect. In other words, the subject with the weakest STS activation to incongruent speech had the smallest probability of experiencing a McGurk percept; whereas the subject with the strongest STS response had the highest probability. Beauchamp et al. (2010) highlight the critical role of the left STS in audiovisual integration. They applied single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the STS of McGurk perceivers during presentation of McGurk stimuli. The perception of the McGurk effect decreased from 94% to 43% and the subjects reported perceiving only the auditory syllable. Following from that, Beauchamp et al. conclude that the left STS is crucial for the audiovisual integration and thus for the perception of the McGurk effect. Moreover, another study suggests that the basis of the interindividual differences in the perception of McGurk effect lies in the eye movements of the subject when viewing the talker‚Äôs face. The experimenters carried out an eye tracking study and measured the eye movements of the participants while viewing audiovisual speech. They found that people who spent more time fixating the mouth of the talker were the more likely to perceive the McGurk effect than those who rarely fixated on the mouth of the speaker. =Other auditory illusions= Representation of the pitch class circle with respect to tone height Interindividual differences have also been researched for the Tritone paradox illusion. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a half octave. Each tone is made of a set of harmonics which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to Diana Deutsch,Deutsch, D. (1991). The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 8(4), 335-347. the perception of the tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the pitch of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the pitch class with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch found that for people from California, the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern England it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups. Other illusions found by Deutsch whose interpretation depends on interindividual differences is the phantom words illusion. This illusion consists of the continuous presentation of two meaningless syllables. In order to experience the illusion, it is necessary that the listener sits between two loudspeakers, one to the left and the other to the right. The syllables are presented offset in time, in such a way that while one syllable is coming from the left, the other syllable is coming from the right loudspeaker. It was shown that after a period of time, people start hearing words. According to Deutsch, the perceived words depend on the language spoken by the listener, their knowledge and their expectations. According to Shinn-Cunningham (2008), when the information is incomplete or contradictory, the perceptual system often fills this gaps with plausible interpretations and in that way allows new information to be efficiently processed. Effect of Culture on Perception The framed line test Several studies have shown that differences between individuals play a significant role in determining how a stimulus is perceived. These differences among people, in turn, are greatly influenced by one's own socio-cultural contexts. The research indicates that cultural factors influence the process of perception not just on lower-level (such as object perception and attention deployment), but also on the higher-order functions (such as theory of mind and emotion recognition). The two major cultures analyzed in these studies were mostly Western and East Asian cultures because of the considerable differences in the social structure and practices. Western culture was referred to as an analytical culture whereas Eastern culture was referred more as a holistic culture. More specifically, individualism and freedom are the predominant values in Western societies, which in turn demand interpretation of an object in its absolute terms independent of its context. In contrast, Eastern culture is known for its emphasis on collectivism and interdependence on each other, where interpretation of an object is often in relation with its context A pioneer study examining these cultural differences in visual perception was conducted by Kitmaya et al. (2003). The findings of that study provide behavioural evidence on how cultural factors affect visual perception and attention deployment. For the study, Americans and Japanese were taken as subjects. The visual stimulus shown to the subjects consisted of a square figure with a line hanging from the centre (the framed line test). First was the absolute condition, where the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in its absolute length, to a new square box independent of its size. Second was the relative condition, in which the task was to redraw the line proportionally similar to context of the new square box. The results show that Americans perform better in the absolute task which requires analytical processing of stimulus independent of it context, whereas the Japanese performed better at the relative task which demands the holistic processing of the stimulus in relation to its context. In line with these findings, Hedden and colleagues (2009) used the same visual stimuli to investigate the neural activity with the help of fMRI. Participants of the study were asked to judge the length of a vertical line, either including the contextual information or ignoring it. The results revealed that separate brain regions were employed while performing the task, either incorporating the contextual information or avoiding it, based on one's own culture. The areas associated with attentional control in the frontal and parietal region of the brain were highly activated when the subjects performed the task which was incongruent to their cultural pattern. That is, the activity in the fronto-parietal region enhanced when East Asians had to ignore the contextual information, while similar enhancement happened for Americans when they had to incorporate the contextual information. These findings illustrate that the function of the neural mechanisms are also modulated to some extent by one's own culture. A follow-up fMRI study by Gutchess, Welsh, Boduroglu, and Park (2006) confirmed the previous findings by using a rather complex stimulus, which consists of only the object pictures, object with background pictures and only the background pictures without the object. This particular study was done on East-Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Though the performance of both subject groups was equally good, the activity of the involved brain areas was significantly different. Non-Asian Americans had a higher activation in the object processing areas in the ventral visual cortex during the object recognition task whereas the East-Asian Americans exhibited higher activity in the left occipital and fusiform areas which are associated with perceptual analysis.

He held command of No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron twice during World War II, and again during the Korean War. Cresswell was credited with being the first RAAF pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft at night over Australian soil, the only man to serve as commanding officer of an RAAF squadron on three occasions during wartime, and the first officer to lead a jet-equipped Australian squadron in combat. His performance in Korea earned him both the Commonwealth and the US Distinguished Flying Crosses. Born in Tasmania, Cresswell worked as an apprentice electrician before joining the RAAF in July 1938. He initially commanded No. 77 Squadron from April 1942 to August 1943, flying P-40 Kittyhawks in defence of Australia's North-Western Area against Japanese raiders. Cresswell claimed the squadron's first aerial victory‚Äîthe first by an Australian over the mainland‚Äîin November 1942. He was wing leader of No. 81 (Fighter) Wing in New Guinea from May 1944 to March 1945, simultaneously commanding No. 77 Squadron for a second time between September and December 1944. In September 1950, during the Korean War, Cresswell took command of No. 77 Squadron in combat for the third time. He oversaw its conversion from P-51 Mustangs to Gloster Meteors, becoming the first RAAF commander of a jet squadron in war. As well as Meteors, Cresswell flew F-80 Shooting Star and F-86 Sabre jets in combat while on attachment to the United States Air Force in Korea. He handed over command of No. 77 Squadron for the last time in August 1951, but flew six more missions as a Meteor pilot in 1953. Cresswell was responsible for converting pilots to jet fighters as commanding officer of No. 2 Operational Training Unit in Australia from 1953 until 1956. He resigned from the RAAF the following year, and flew with Bobby Gibbes' Sepik Airways in New Guinea before joining de Havilland Australia in 1959. Initially engaged by the company as a pilot, he later became a salesman. Cresswell resigned from de Havilland in 1974, but maintained his connection with military aviation, including No. 77 Squadron. He died in December 2006, aged eighty-six. Early life Richard Cresswell was born in Franklin, near Launceston, Tasmania, on 27 July 1920.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 5‚Äì7 He was the only child of English immigrants George Cresswell, an engineer, and his wife Constance (n√©e de Havilland). His father died when Dick was three-and-a-half, and he later moved to Sydney with his mother. For three years he lived with another family in Balgowlah, and commenced his schooling at Manly West. He again lived with his mother in Potts Point between 1931 and 1938, continuing his education at Double Bay and Randwick. After leaving Randwick High School in 1935, he began technical studies at Ultimo as part of an electrical apprenticeship with Westinghouse.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 7 Fired partly by his mother's stories of joy flights in pre-war Britain, and a desire to become a flying boat captain for Imperial Airways, Cresswell applied to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) in September 1937. Receiving no answer from the RAF, he applied for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and was accepted.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 7‚Äì8 He entered No. 1 Flying Training School at Point Cook, Victoria, as an air cadet in July 1938. Over the next twelve months he learnt to fly in Avro Cadet, de Havilland Gipsy Moth and Westland Wapiti trainers, and graduated as a pilot officer.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 8‚Äì9 His first posting was to No. 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at Richmond, New South Wales, where he began flying Hawker Demon fighters in July 1939.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 10‚Äì11 Cresswell recalled a mix of excitement and panic within the squadron when World War II broke out two months later: \\"The second night we all slept on the hangar floor next to our aircraft. Imagine it: there was war over in Europe and here we were at action stations!\\"Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 441‚Äì442 World War II After a brief posting to Point Cook in early 1940, Cresswell undertook the instructors' course at Central Flying School in Camden, New South Wales.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 13 He then became an instructor at No. 2 Service Flying Training School, which was formed at Wagga Wagga in July and operated Avro Ansons and CAC Wirraways.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 13‚Äì14RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, p. 102 The school's commander, Frederick Scherger, advised Cresswell to grow a moustache to overcome his youthful appearance. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in January 1941.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 14 Following the bombing of Darwin by Japanese forces on 19 February 1942, Cresswell was posted to Williamtown as a liaison officer with the 9th Squadron of the US 49th Pursuit Group (later the 49th Fighter Group), which operated P-40 Kittyhawks and would shortly transfer to Darwin to provide air defence for the North-Western Area.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 18‚Äì19Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 136‚Äì137 The RAAF had meanwhile raised three fighter units‚ÄîNos. 75, 76 and 77 Squadrons‚Äîequipped with Kittyhawks recently delivered from the United States.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 139‚Äì141 Cresswell, newly promoted to squadron leader, assumed command of No. 77 Squadron at Pearce, Western Australia, on 20 April. At twenty-one, he was younger than most of his personnel.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 19‚Äì21 Drawing on his technical experience at Westinghouse, he encouraged his pilots to respect their aircraft and the ground crews that maintained them.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 16, 21 Initially responsible for the air defence of Perth, No. 77 Squadron transferred to Batchelor Airfield near Darwin in August, becoming the first RAAF fighter unit to be stationed in the North-Western Area.RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, p. 54Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, pp. 89‚Äì91 It moved to another of Darwin's satellite airfields, Livingstone, in September.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 644 Cresswell led the squadron in the defence of Darwin against Japanese raiders and claimed its first aerial victory just after 5 a.m. on 23 November 1942, when he destroyed a Mitsubishi \\"Betty\\" bomber.Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 250‚Äì251 It was the first \\"kill\\" for an Australian squadron over the mainland, and the first night victory over Australia. When he returned to base and was asked what he felt like, Cresswell replied, \\"Breakfast\\". He souvenired the radio operator's seat from the bomber's wreckage. alt=Mustachioed man in forage cap and khaki uniform, next to a single-engined military aircraft In February 1943, after No. 1 (Fighter) Wing and its three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons became operational in the Darwin area, No. 77 Squadron was transferred to Milne Bay in New Guinea.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 651Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 267, 291 It came under the control of the newly formed No. 71 Wing, which was part of No. 9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile formation in the South West Pacific Area.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 23‚Äì24Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 144 The Japanese attacked Milne Bay on 14 April, and Cresswell claimed one of four bombers (and a fighter) credited to No. 77 Squadron.RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, p. 55Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 285‚Äì287 The next month, No. 77 Squadron began moving to Goodenough Island, where it was controlled by No. 73 Wing.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 33‚Äì36Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 43‚Äì44 As Japanese fighter opposition was limited, Cresswell led the squadron in several ground-attack missions over New Britain.Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 320 He was due to hand over command to his designated successor, Flight Lieutenant Daryl Sproule, on 2 August, but Sproule crash-landed during a raid the same day and was captured and executed by the Japanese.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 71 As a result, Cresswell remained in command another three weeks.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 46 On 28 August 1943, Cresswell was ordered to report to Port Pirie, South Australia, for \\"flying duties\\", but found instead that he was to be court-martialled for \\"conduct to the prejudice of good order and Air Force discipline\\". The charge arose from an incident in July 1942, when Cresswell had stayed overnight at Port Pirie's mess and had fired his revolver into the floor next to the feet of another officer who apparently had been annoying him.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 46‚Äì47Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 251 Cresswell was found guilty and lost three months' seniority. He considered resigning his commission but was placated by the Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 47 Cresswell was promoted to wing commander in January 1944, backdated three months to eliminate the penalty of his court-martial.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 47‚Äì48 After instructing at No. 2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, Victoria, Cresswell was appointed wing leader of No. 1 Wing on 25 February 1944, at the specific request of its commander, Group Captain Peter Jeffery, to help reduce Spitfire accident rates.Watson, Killer Caldwell, p. 101 In March, No. 1 Wing hurriedly despatched two squadrons to Western Australia in response to fears that a Japanese naval force would raid the Perth area; no attack ensued, and the squadrons returned within two weeks.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 136‚Äì139 Darwin was by now free of Japanese raids and Cresswell left on 12 May to become wing leader and temporary commander of No. 81 (Fighter) Wing in Townsville, Queensland. Comprising three Kittyhawk squadrons, including No. 77, the wing transferred to Noemfoor in western New Guinea as part of No. 10 Operational Group (later First Tactical Air Force), which had taken over No. 9 Group's mobile role and was supporting the US landings along the north coast of New Guinea.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 249 Cresswell arrived at Noemfoor on 26 September 1944 to be informed by No. 81 Wing's new commander, Group Captain Gordon Steege, that he did not need a wing leader. Instead, Steege assigned Cresswell to command No. 77 Squadron, for the second time during the war. Cresswell questioned the decision through official channels, with the result that he retained the position of wing leader, as well as the command of No. 77 Squadron.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 50‚Äì51 The wing flew 1,125 sorties against Japanese buildings, stores and transport in October and November, dropping over of bombs for the loss of fifteen aircraft and eleven pilots.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 386‚Äì390 The following month, Group Captain Wilfred Arthur replaced Steege as commander of No. 81 Wing, and Cresswell handed over command of No. 77 Squadron, while continuing to serve as wing leader.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 54 Arthur recommended Cresswell for a Distinguished Flying Cross, but according to biographer George Odgers this was \\"'lost' in the system\\".Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 2 The relegation of First Tactical Air Force to areas of operation bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale. Arthur produced a \\"balance sheet\\" to demonstrate that No. 81 Wing's combat results were not worth the cost in ordnance and casualties, setting in train events that would culminate in the so-called \\"Morotai Mutiny\\" the following April, when eight senior pilots, including Arthur and fellow aces Clive Caldwell and Bobby Gibbes, protested by attempting to resign their commissions.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 443‚Äì450 Cresswell was by then in Australia on leave, having posted out from No. 81 Wing in March. Though in complete accord with the aims of the \\"mutineers\\", he believed that attempting to resign their commissions en masse was not an appropriate response.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 61 Between wars alt=Overhead shot of single-engined fighter aircraft in flight Cresswell was on the twelve-week War Staff Course at the RAAF Staff School in Mount Martha, Victoria, when hostilities ended in the Pacific; the course finished on 28 September 1945.Hurst, Strategy and Red Ink, pp. 7‚Äì9 He was then tasked with developing a P-51 Mustang conversion course, to train pilots for service with No. 81 Wing, comprising three Mustang squadrons, including No. 77, as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 65‚Äì66 On 1 February 1946, the crew conversion unit, CCU (Fighter), was established at Williamtown.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 71‚Äì73RAAF Historical Section, Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations, pp. 169‚Äì171 Cresswell served initially as the CCU's chief instructor, and then as commanding officer from 29 March 1947. At the same time, he took command of the Williamtown base, as well as No. 78 (Fighter) Wing, which controlled two Mustang squadrons and several ancillary units.No. 78 Wing, \\"Operations Record Book\\", p. 117 He had married a war widow, Bettine Harrison-Owen (n√©e Cotter), on 27 July 1946 at St John's Church in Toorak, Victoria. CCU (Fighter) disbanded on 7 July 1947, but Cresswell remained in command of Williamtown and No. 78 Wing until March 1948.No. 78 Wing, \\"Operations Record Book\\", p. 147 After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell served on the directing staff of the first two courses held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six- month course on 13 June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following demobilisation.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 67‚Äì69Hurst, Strategy and Red Ink, p. 15 On 10 July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No. 21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.RAAF Historical Section, Bomber Units, pp. 58‚Äì60Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 69 Korean War When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, No. 77 Squadron was the only remaining RAAF unit of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan.

According to George Odgers, his prior command of the squadron in combat and long experience flying single-engined aircraft, including the Mustang, meant that \\"it would have been very difficult to find a RAAF fighter pilot who could equal Squadron Leader Cresswell's qualifications\\".Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 79‚Äì80 Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war Air Force, noted that Cresswell was considered \\"a good organiser and a 'goer'\\". In an unusual move, the RAAF did not raise him to wing commander; he became No. 77 Squadron's longest-serving commanding officer of the Korean War, but also the only one ranked squadron leader.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 112Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 155 This had the effect of ranking him below the US squadron commanders with whom he had to cooperate and of leaving him without an operations officer of squadron leader rank to whom he could delegate some of the day-to-day tasks of running his unit.O'Neill, Australia in the Korean War, p. 312 Squadron Leader Cresswell (right) commanding No. 77 Squadron, with Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson (centre) and Group Captain Dallas Charlton (left) commanding No. 91 Wing, South Korea, December 1950 Spence's loss was a heavy blow to the squadron, and Cresswell's first task after arriving in Japan on 17 September 1950 was to restore morale. Pilot Jim Flemming recalled that Cresswell \\"led from the front\\", undertaking four sorties on 20 September, his first day of operations.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 62‚Äì64 No. 77 Squadron transferred from Iwakuni in Japan to Pohang, South Korea, on 12 October to support UN troops advancing northwards from the Pusan Perimeter following General Douglas MacArthur's amphibious landing behind North Korean lines at Inchon.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 227‚Äì228 On 20 October, the squadron became a component of the RAAF's newly established No. 91 (Composite) Wing, headquartered at Iwakuni, but was under the operational control of the US 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 228 Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni-based wing headquarters was not always in tune with frontline requirements, and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, BCOF commander and the theatre's senior Australian officer, and the RAAF's Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Scherger, former commander at Wagga Wagga.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 73, 79Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 110 China entered the war in October 1950, and No. 77 Squadron undertook its first sorties against Chinese ground forces on 1 November.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 229 It flew its first missions supporting the Australian Army four days later, when Cresswell led attacks on Chinese armour opposing the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, at Pakchon.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 91Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 84 The 3rd Battalion's Major Bruce Ferguson described No. 77 Squadron's close support as \\"the closest I have ever seen\\".Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 92 On 16 November, the Australians began moving forward with the 35th Group to Yonpo, near Hamhung.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 102Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 80 From Yonpo they flew missions against Chinese forces surrounding the US Marines at Chosin Reservoir; Cresswell personally commanded several night sorties, attacking Chinese positions with machine guns and rockets.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 88‚Äì89 The Communist advance resulted in the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to Pusan in early December. Cresswell had made a point of briefing his squadron every night during the developing crisis to avoid any panic arising from unsubstantiated rumours; the commander of the US Fifth Air Force, Lieutenant General Earle E. Partridge, praised him for his leadership.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 102‚Äì104Stephens, Going Solo, p. 231 Since November 1950, the Communists had been operating a Russian- designed swept-wing jet fighter, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, that outclassed all other fighters in the theatre except the new F-86 Sabre.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 229‚Äì230 The MiGs were often flown by seasoned Soviet Air Force pilots, whose deployment was unofficial, and denied at the time by the Soviet Union.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 107, 140 The RAAF tried to purchase Sabres to replace No. 77 Squadron's Mustangs but deliveries could not begin until 1954, so in December the Australian government agreed to buy British Gloster Meteor straight-wing jet fighters. In January and February 1951, while awaiting delivery of the Meteors, Cresswell gained jet experience by converting to F-80 Shooting Stars and flying ten combat missions on attachment to the USAF's 8th Fighter Group.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 119‚Äì121Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 111‚Äì112 This convinced him that the Meteors would require radio compasses to navigate in bad weather, and with the support of the USAF he succeeded in having these fitted.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 114‚Äì115 No. 77 Squadron completed its last Mustang mission on 6 April 1951 and returned to Iwakuni the next day to begin converting to Meteors.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 126 Since July 1950 it had been credited with destroying sixty armoured vehicles and guns, 600 other vehicles, and over 2,000 buildings. Sixteen Mustangs had been destroyed and thirteen pilots killed.O'Neill, Australia in the Korean War, p. 345 The squadron's loss rate in Korea was higher than it had sustained in a similar period during World War II.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 121 On 20 April, the Americans awarded Cresswell the Air Medal for \\"meritorious service\\" and the Distinguished Flying Cross for \\"superior flying ability and extraordinary achievement\\". Permission to wear the decorations was gazetted on 22 June and 13 July, respectively. alt=Twelve men in flying suits in a semi-circle around another man in front of a twin-engined jet aircraft Though it had operated mainly as a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No. 77 Squadron's primary role in the RAAF was interception, and it was hoped that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in Korea.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 231‚Äì232 Cresswell therefore arranged for the USAF to lend him a Sabre to simulate a MiG-15 in combat training with the Meteors at Iwakuni; he determined that the Meteor's manoeuvrability and rate of climb allowed it to match the swept-wing jet below , so the best air-to-air tactic would be to work in concert with USAF Sabres operating at high level while the Australians flew at lower altitudes.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 132‚Äì133 On 20 July, No. 77 Squadron began moving to Kimpo, South Korea, where it was tasked by the USAF's 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 132Stephens, Going Solo, p. 233 Cresswell took the squadron on its first Meteor operation on 29 July, an offensive sweep in \\"MiG Alley\\" between the Yalu and Chongchon Rivers on North Korea's border with Manchuria, making him the first officer to lead an RAAF jet squadron in combat.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 2, 133 After encountering ill-directed anti-aircraft fire over Pyongyang, the Australians saw MiG-15s parked in an airfield on the Chinese side of the border‚Äîwhere UN forces were forbidden to attack‚Äîbut, somewhat to Cresswell's annoyance, the Communists refused to take off and fight.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 133‚Äì135Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 142‚Äì143 He led the squadron on further offensive sweeps with USAF Sabres, and missions escorting B-29 Superfortresses, but had no contact with MiGs in the air before completing his term as commanding officer and handing over to Wing Commander Steege on 16 August 1951.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 234Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 143‚Äì145 Although no longer commanding a squadron, Cresswell continued flying in Korea. He secured another attachment to the USAF and converted to the F-86 Sabre in early September 1951.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 137‚Äì138 Between 22 September and 1 October, he flew ten combat missions in Sabres with the 336th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, dogfighting with MiG-15s on several occasions and damaging one.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 141‚Äì142Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 147 Cresswell left for Australia shortly afterwards, having flown a total of 144 sorties during the war: 110 in Mustangs, fourteen in Meteors, and ten each in Shooting Stars and Sabres. He was recommended for the Commonwealth Distinguished Flying Cross for \\"leadership of high order\\" on 23 October 1951; the award was promulgated on 8 January 1952. According to Alan Stephens, \\"many who were familiar with his performance thought the higher Distinguished Service Order would have been more appropriate. There were suggestions that his occasional flamboyance, confidence and impressive combat experience were resented by more pedestrian senior RAAF officers\\". Upon returning to Australia, Cresswell was promoted to wing commander and appointed Fighter Staff Member at the RAAF Directorate of Operations.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 148 In late 1952 he was \\"dared\\" to fly from the Royal Australian Navy aircraft carrier HMAS Sydney, and did so in a Hawker Sea Fury after completing conversion.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 149 In his capacity as RAAF Fighter Staff Member, Cresswell returned to Korea in March‚ÄìApril 1953, flying six Meteor sorties with No. 77 Squadron, and reporting deficiencies in instrument flying and air combat technique among the pilots.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 149‚Äì150Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 230 An armistice ended the Korean War on 27 July.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 242 After Korea alt=Mustachioed man in flying suit and helmet alighting from cockpit Post-war demobilisation had seen the disbandment of all the RAAF's operational training units, and conversion of new pilots to combat aircraft became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, and the advent of the Korean War and the introduction of jets exacerbated shortfalls in operational training.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 167‚Äì168, 364 Cresswell recalled that as commanding officer of No. 77 Squadron in Korea he had to send several replacement pilots back to Australia: \\"I don't blame the pilots, but I do blame the Air Force system. We had no operational training units, no operational training system and, as a result, the pilots came to Korea poorly trained and without instrument ratings. They just couldn't operate in the area.\\"Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 150 The RAAF re-formed No. 2 Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU) in March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at Williamtown, No. 2 OTU was initially equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and de Havilland Vampire jets.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 62‚Äì64Stephens, Going Solo, p. 489 Cresswell assumed command on 21 May 1953. He established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight in November, to prepare for the introduction into service of Australian-built CAC Sabres.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 156Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 348‚Äì349 As well as performance testing, the flight was responsible for teaching air-to-air combat techniques, to fill a capability void caused by the departure of many veteran fighter pilots of World War II, and the RAAF's operational focus on ground attack rather than air combat in Korea. To facilitate the training, Cresswell and another pilot developed the RAAF's fighter combat instructor course in 1954. This course was administered at Williamtown by No. 2 OTU's successor formation, No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit until 2017, when responsibility for conducting it was transferred to the Tactics and Training Directorate. On 3 December 1954, Cresswell led a formation of twelve No. 2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No. 77 Squadron upon its return from Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 153 His successor as commanding officer of the conversion unit took over on 27 March 1956. Cresswell was posted to RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, as Director of Air Staff Policy. The position put him in line for promotion to group captain but, as he admitted later, \\"I had itchy feet and I felt the Service had already given me all the operational flying I was likely to get.\\"Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 160 He decided to resign his commission in December 1956, and was discharged from the RAAF on 30 April 1957. Later life On 13 June 1957, Cresswell became regional manager of a Melbourne firm salvaging metal from the battlefields of New Guinea, but the company wound up its operations in Australasia barely a month later. Bobby Gibbes then offered him the position of chief pilot with his New Guinea-based Sepik Airways. Cresswell flew Noorduyn Norseman and Junkers Ju 52 aircraft out of Goroka until October 1958, when he was hospitalised with hepatitis.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 160‚Äì163 He attempted to rejoin the RAAF the following year but was found to be suffering from malaria and dengue fever, as well as the after-effects of hepatitis.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 163‚Äì164 On 6 October 1959, he joined de Havilland Australia to fly DHC-2 Beavers in Antarctica.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 164 Cresswell's first marriage had failed after his return from the Korean War in 1951.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 145 He married Margaret Schwennesen, a pilot, on 23 December 1959 at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne; the couple had two daughters.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 164‚Äì165 Cresswell began flying in Antarctica on 14 January 1960, mapping sections of the continent claimed by Australia. The task was cut short on 3 February, when the RAAF Antarctic Flight pressed his Beaver into service after three of its aircraft were lost in a blizzard at Mawson. De Havilland then assigned Cresswell to fly personnel and equipment for Australian Blue Metal in northern and central Australia. Between November 1960 and March 1961 he was involved in another Antarctic expedition, but in the end did little flying. De Havilland subsequently appointed Cresswell its sales representative in Canberra; in this capacity he travelled abroad and on one occasion flew the DHC-4 Caribou, shortly to be purchased by the RAAF for tactical transport in the Vietnam War.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 165‚Äì166 After a series of minor heart attacks and two bypass operations, Cresswell resigned from de Havilland late in 1974 to live in South-East Queensland; his family elected to remain in Canberra.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 168 Cresswell continued his interest in military aviation, maintaining his RAAF connections, and patronising the Australian War Memorial (AWM) and the No. 77 Squadron Association.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 168‚Äì169 In April 1975 he presented the AWM with the radio operator's seat from the \\"Betty\\" he shot down in November 1942. After divorcing Margaret, he married a third time in 1979 but his new wife died two years later, and he returned to Canberra in the mid-1980s at the urging of his daughters. In 1992 he led members of No. 77 Squadron in a march through the streets of Perth, which had granted the unit freedom of entry in recognition of its role in the city's defence fifty years earlier.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 3 Cresswell also undertook speaking engagements, including the annual veterans' symposium at the Australian Command and Staff College (ACSC). On 23 July 1998, he was at Williamtown for the formal presentation of the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation that had been awarded to No. 77 Squadron on 1 November 1951 for its performance in the Korean War.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. 144‚Äì145 He visited the newly completed Bradbury Aircraft Hall at the AWM in August 2000, commenting, \\"The past has a very strong will to live\\". The following April, he was among thirty-two Korean War veterans selected to represent Australia at fiftieth anniversary commemorations of the conflict being held in South Korea. Cresswell died in Canberra of a heart attack on 13 December 2006, aged eighty-six, and was survived by his second wife Margaret and their two daughters.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 169 His funeral was held at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, which was overflown by four F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters from No. 77 Squadron in a \\"missing man\\" formation. In 2007, an exercise at the ACSC was named after Cresswell.

The probability that the next medication will achieve seizure freedom drops with every failed AED; for example after two failed AEDs the probability that the third will achieve seizure freedom is around 4%. Drug- resistant epilepsy is commonly diagnosed after several years of uncontrolled seizures however in most cases it is evident much earlier. Approximately 30% of people with epilepsy have a drug-resistant form. When 2 AEDs regimens have failed to produce sustained seizure-freedom, it is important to initiate other treatments to control seizures. Next to indirect consequences like injuries from falls, accidents, drowning and impairment in daily life, seizure control is critical because uncontrolled seizures -specifically generalized tonic clonic seizures- can damage the brain and increase the risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy called SUDEP. The first step is for physicians to refer their DRE patients to an epilepsy center in which a presurgical evaluation can be carried out in order to assess whether a patient is a candidate for epilepsy surgery or not. For those patients who are not surgical candidates, those who decline brain surgery or those in which brain surgery fails to produce long term seizure freedom, vagus nerve stimulation and/or a diet can be recommended.  Surgery  In epilepsy surgery a distinction can be made between resective and disconnective procedures. In a resective procedure the area of the brain that causes the seizures is removed. In a disconnective procedure the neural connections in the brain that allow the seizures to spread are disconnected. In most cases epilepsy surgery is only an option when the area of the brain that causes the seizures - the so-called epileptic focus can be clearly identified and is not responsible for critical functions such as language. Several imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance tomography and functional techniques like electrocorticography are used to demarcate the epileptic focus clearly. =Lobe resection= Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in which the epileptic focus is in the temporal lobe, is one of the most common types of epilepsy in adolescents and adults. Hence temporal lobe resection, during which the whole temporal lobe or just a part of the temporal lobe for example the hippocampus or the amygdala is removed, is the most common epilepsy surgery procedure. Between 40 and 60% of patients that undergo temporal lobe resection are continuously seizure free The surgery itself is very safe with a mortality of 0%. The risk for neurologic complications from a temporal lobe resection is around 3 to 7% =Lesionectomy= if the source of seizures is a lesion for example a scar tissue from a brain injury a tumor or malformed blood vessels this lesion can be removed surgically in a lesionectomy. =Corpus callosotomy= Corpus callosotomy is a palliative procedure for specially severe cases of epilepsy. This corpus callosum is a large bundle of nerve fibers that connects both brain halves with each other. To prevent the spreading of seizures from one brain hemisphere (brain half) to the other the corpus callosum can be split. This procedure is mostly carried out on patients with so-called drop attacks that come with a very high risk of injury and in which the epileptic focus is not clearly delimitable. It is very rare that a corpus callosotomy causes seizure freedom however in half of the patients the dangerous drop attacks are less severe. After a corpus callosotomy among others there is the risk that language is temporarily or permanently impaired. The younger a patient is at the time of the corpus callosotomy, the better the prognosis. =Functional hemispherectomy= This procedure is a modern adaptation of the radical hemispherectomy in which one brain hemisphere is removed to prevent the spread of seizures from one brain hemisphere to the other. In the functional version only a part of the hemisphere is removed but the connections to the other brain hemisphere are cut through. This procedure is only performed on a small group of patients under the age of 13 that have severe damage or malformation of one hemisphere, patients with Sturge Weber syndrome or patients with Rasmussen's encephalitis. The functional hemispherectomy can achieve long-term seizure freedom in over 80% of patients however often at the price of hemiplegia and hemianopsy. The death rate is around 1 to 2% and 5% of patients develop a hydrocephalus that needs to be treated with a shunt. =Multiple subpial transection= Multiple subpial transection (MST) is a palliative procedure that is considered when an epileptic focus can be identified but cannot be removed because it is in a functionally relevant brain region- a so- called eloquent region. In an MST nerve fibers are disconnected so that seizures cannot spread from the epileptic focus into the rest of the brain. Between 60 and 70% of patients experienced a seizure reduction of over 95% after an MST and the risk for neurologic deficits is around 19%. =Vagus nerve stimulation = Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) involves implanting a pacemaker-like generator below the skin in the chest area that intermittently sends electrical impulses to the left vagus nerve in the neck. The impulses are mediated to the brain by the vagus nerve and thereby help to inhibit electrical disturbances that cause seizures. The antiepileptic effect of vagus nerve stimulation increases over several months: after two years around half of VNS patients experience a reduction of their seizures by at least 50% and after 10 years the average seizure reduction is around 75% Furthermore, in most patients mood (VNS has a significant anti-depressent effect and is approved for depression in some countries), alertness and quality-of-life are increased significantly within the first year of vagus nerve stimulation. VNS patients can induce an extra stimulation themselves with a VNS magnet when they noticed that a seizure is approaching and it has been shown that the majority of seizures can be interrupted this type of on-demand stimulation. The procedure to implant a vagus nerve stimulator is very safe: no case of death related to VNS implantation surgery has ever occurred. Infection of the tissue pocket in which the generator is located that requires antibiotic treatment occurs in around 3% of patients. The most common side effect is hoarseness or change in voice. Headaches and shortness of breath are less common. In most cases, side effects only occur during activity of the stimulation (mostly every 3 to 5 minutes) and reduce over time. In most cases VNS does not replace antiepileptic medication. Patients must continue their antiepileptic medication however in many cases the dose can be reduced over time so that patients suffer less from side effects of the medication. The battery of the VNS generator can depending on the model and the settings can last between 3 and 10 years. =VNS with cardiac-based seizure detection= In 82% of epilepsy patients the heart rate increases quickly and suddenly upon a seizure This is known as ictal tachycardia. Ictal tachycardia is so characteristic that it can be distinguished from the slow gradual increase of heart rate that occurs during physical activity. This way in the majority of epilepsy patients seizures can be detected in the ECG. In addition to classical VNS, some new VNS generators continuously monitor heart rate and identify fast and sudden heart rate increases associated with seizures with intelligent software. Then an automatic additional stimulation can be triggered to interrupt, prevent or alleviate the seizure. This new generator type was shown to detect and treat at least four out of five seizures and 60% of seizures were shown to be interrupted with this heart-rate triggered stimulation. The earlier in the course of the seizure the stimulation occurred the quicker the seizure ended generally seizures were shown to be reduced by around 35% by stimulation Diets For over 100 years it has been known that a diet with a high fat content and a low carbohydrate content can reduce seizures. Radically curbing carbohydrate intake imitates starvation and forces the body to draw energy from ketone bodies that form when fat is metabolized instead of drawing its energy from sugar. This state is called ketosis and it changes several biochemical processes in the brain in a way that inhibits epileptic activity. On this basis there are several diets that are often recommended to children under 12 years old, but are also effective in adults. =Ketogenic diet= In Europe the ketogenic diet is the diet that is most commonly recommended by doctors for patients with epilepsy. In this diet the ratio of fat to carbohydrates and proteins is 4:1. That means that the fat content of the consumed food must be around 80%, the protein content must be around 15%, and the carbohydrate content must be around 5%. For comparison the average western diet consists of a carbohydrate content of over 50%. After one year on the ketogenic diet the success rate (seizure reduction over 50%) is between 30 and 50% and the dropout rate is around 45%. Although the ketogenic diet can be very effective some families report that it's not compatible with daily life on the long run because it's too restrictive as bread pasta and sweets are forbidden in the ketogenic diet. In puberty with increasing autonomy it can be difficult for adolescents to follow the diet strictly. For this reason a fat ratio of 3: 1 instead of 4: 1 can be recommended to make meals more palatable. Side effects of the ketogenic diet can be constipation, tiredness and after a long term diet, in one out of 20 patients, kidney stones. =MCT-Ketogenic diet= In the 1960s it was discovered that when medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) fats are metabolized in the body more ketone bodies are produced then from metabolizing any other fat. Based on this mechanism the MCT ketogenic diet a modification of the ketogenic diet was developed and it has nearly replaced the classic ketogenic diet in the USA. In the MCT ketogenic diet MCT oil is added to ketogenic meals, which allows the carbohydrate content to be increased to around 15 to 20%. This way some patients find the meals more enjoyable. The success rate of the MCT ketogenic diet does not differ from the classic ketogenic diet however not all children can tolerate the necessary large amounts of MCT oil which is also very expensive. =Modified Atkins= A modified Atkins diet describes the long term practice of the first phase of the popular Atkins diet the so-called induction phase to reduce seizures through ketosis. In this diet the fat content of the nutrition is slightly lower than in the ketogenic diet at around 60%, the protein content is around 30% and the carbohydrate content is around 10% rendering the diet less restrictive and more compatible with the daily life compared to the ketogenic diet. Several studies show that the modified Atkins diet produces a similar or slightly lower seizure reduction to the ketogenic diet. Some physicians, especially in the USA, recommend the modified Atkins diet because they assume that patients will adhere to it on the long-term because it is more compatible with daily life and the meals are more enjoyable. It has also been concluded in another study that the diet is well tolerated and effective in hard to treat childhood epilepsy. =Other= Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus is approved for DRE in some countries in Europe, but has been and continues to only be used in a very few patients. After 5 years of DBS a seizure reduction of 69% and a 50%-responder rate of 68% was reported in a randomized-double blinded trial. The rate of serious device related events was 34% in this study. Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) is approved for DRE in the USA and involves stimulation directly to 1 or 2 seizure foci when abnormal electrocorticographic activity is detected by the devices software. After 2 years of RNS a seizure reduction of 53% was reported in a randomized-double blinded trial as well as a rate of serious device related events of 2.5%. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is approved for DRE in some European countries and involves externally stimulating the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the ear. tVNS failed to demonstrate efficacy in a first randomized-double blinded trial: responder rates did not differ between active and control groups potentially indicating a placebo effect behind the 34% seizure reduction seen in the patients who completed the full follow-up period.

She is the founder of the Centre for English Corpus Linguistics (CECL) and is best known for her pioneering work in the field of Learner Corpus Research. She has mainly published in the areas of corpus linguistics, learner language, contrastive linguistics, translation studies and lexicography.  Career  Sylviane Granger completed her entire career at UCLouvain. After studying English and Dutch philology, she started as a research fellow at the FNRS in 1972. She later took on a teaching assistant position in English language and linguistics, and in 1981 she obtained her PhD under the supervision of Jacques Van Roey. Her PhD dissertation was about the use of be + past participle in spoken English with a special focus on the passive. She then continued her career as a professor in English language and linguistics. In 1991, she founded the Centre for English Corpus Linguistics, whose main research focus is learner language and contrastive linguistics. During her first sabbatical leave in 1995, she taught at Lancaster University and completed the volume Learner English on Computer, which came out in 1998. She took a second sabbatical in 2002 during which she taught at Columbia University. In 2016 she was appointed to a Francqui Chair at the University of Leuven-Kortrijk. She retired in September 2016 and is now an Emeritus professor.  Learner Corpus Research  Her pioneering work on learner language set the cornerstone for the field of Learner Corpus Research. One of the main tenets of the discipline is that learner language is best approached holistically and naturalistically. Within this framework, she launched the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) enterprise. ICLE is a collection of rigorously controlled written learner productions in English that are comparable across first language backgrounds. The first version, containing nine language backgrounds, came out in 2002. The second version, released in 2009, contains data from 16 learner populations, and a third version is in the making. Its spoken counterpart, the Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage (LINDSEI), came out in 2011. Besides those two, she also launched the collection of a number of other corpora, such as LOCNESS, PLECI and LONGDALE. She is also the co-founder and president of the Learner Corpus Association and consulting editor for the International Journal of Learner Corpus Research.

It includes five residences and several outbuildings, most of which are agricultural in character, representing the area's shift in use in the 20th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The village of South Newbury consists of a small collection of residences and some associated outbuildings. It is located at the junction of Doe Lane and Doe Hill Road, the latter being a former alignment of United States Route 5, which now runs just to the east of the village. Four of the five houses are clustered at the junction, while the fifth, part of a farm complex, is located a short way to the south. The houses are unusually architecturally diverse for such a small collection, in some cases combining elements of different styles. Two of the houses in particular were built in the early 19th century as Federal style houses, and have substantial Italianate elements that were added later. with South Newbury is one of the first places to be settled in the town of Newbury. The early residents were drawn to the area by the rich farmlands of the Connecticut River floodplain, and by the water power offered by Hall's Brook, which descends to the river east of the district. The first mill on the brook was built in 1764, and in the 19th century several mills lined its banks, all since destroyed either by fires or spring floods. The village also benefited as a stop on the stagecoach route that ran along the river. Development was effectively arrested when the new alignment of US 5 bypassed the area.

It is on the left (west) bank of the Purus River, downstream from Boca do Acre. The Inauini/Teuini Indigenous Territory to the north partly overlaps the national forest. It is bounded to the west by the Mapi√°-Inauini National Forest. To the south it adjoins the Camicu√£ Indigeous Territory. It takes at least six hours to cover the road from Rio Branco to Boca do Acre, and the same length of time by boat on the Purus River and then the Mapia stream to reach the central village of C√©u do Mapi√°. This community in the forest is devoted to consecration of the shamanic-Christian syncretism of Santo Daime. During the dry season access is limited to the Purus River. Environment Average temperatures range from . Rainfall is from annually. Rain mostly falls in the months of October to April, while the driest season is from June to August. The topography is a plateau with hills and flat areas dissected by deep valleys. The alluvial areas that are flooded by the Purus River are relatively fertile due to sediments from the Andes. However, most of the soils are very poor and acidic. The vegetation is entirely dense rainforest. In the higher terra firma areas and the valley slopes the canopy reaches . The main tree species are Dinizia excelsa, Manilkara huberi, Anacardium species, Parkia pendula and Bertholletia excelsa. In the v√°rzea forest along the Mapi√° stream (Igarap√© Mapi√°) the canopy is typically high. The Mapi√° is densely occupied, with many areas of deforestation along its course. In general the area beyond the village of C√©u do Mapi√° and the Teuini stream is well-preserved. History The Purus National Forest was created by federal decree 96.190 of 21 June 1988, with an estimated area of . It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The forest is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources).

This was amended to 300 families on 31 December 2008. The management plan was approved on 18 March 2009. The consultative council was created on 10 March 2010. Economy In July 2007 the Residents Association of C√©u do Mapi√° Village (Associa√ß√£o de Moradores da Vila C√©u do Mapi√° - AMVCM) began to implement community forest management in the village's zone of community use in partnership with the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, the Federal University of Vi√ßosa and the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden. The plan is to produce sufficient quantities of wood to meet community demand. As of 2010 the community was engaged in subsistence farming and raising small animals. There were 600 residents. The community has an area of for forest management, and plan to use per year for logging. The community zone of use is , of which potentially could be used for forest management.

(1957). Theory and history, p. 1. This position is based on the presupposition that humans differ radically from other objects in the external world. Namely, humans purposefully aim at chosen ends and employ chosen means to attain them (i.e. humans act), whereas other objects in nature ‚îÄ such as, for example, sticks, stones, and atoms ‚îÄ do not.id., p. xiii. Methodological dualism is not a metaphysical or ontological doctrine, and refrains from making such judgments.id., p. 1.  Overview  Ludwig von Mises' insistence on methodological dualism was a reaction against ‚Äúthe ‚Äòmethodological monism‚Äô preached by behaviorists and positivists who [saw] no basic reason to approach human behavior and social phenomena differently from the way natural scientists approach molecular behavior and physical phenomena.‚ÄùWhite, L. (2003). The methodology of the Austrian school economists, p. 17. Mises states that the sciences of human action deal with ends and means, with volition, with meaning and understanding, with ‚Äúthoughts, ideas, and judgments of value‚Äù. Action is the purposive use of chosen means for the attainment of chosen ends, and ideas, beliefs, and judgments of value (called mental phenomena) determine the choice of both means and ends.Mises. (2008). Human action: A treatise on economics, pp. 11-3. Thus, these mental phenomena occupy a central position in the sciences of human action for, as Mises argues, ‚Äúacts of choosing are determined by thoughts and ideas.‚ÄùTheory and history, p. 11. In arguing for methodological dualism, Mises states because the natural sciences have not yet determined ‚Äúhow definite external events [‚Ä¶] produce within the human mind definite ideas, value judgments, and volitions‚Äù,Mises. (1962). The ultimate foundation of economic science, p. 83. this ignorance splits our knowledge into two distinct fields, the ‚Äúrealm of external events‚Äù on the one hand, and the ‚Äúrealm of human thought and action‚Äù on the other. Thus Mises‚Äô conception of the sciences of human action ‚îÄ i.e. praxeology and thymology ‚îÄ is based on this methodological dualism. Mises argues that because we are ourselves thinking and acting beings we can reflect, through introspection,Theory and history, p. 283-4. on the meaning of action, of intention and volition, of ends and means, and on our ideas, beliefs, and judgments of value. This kind of reflective knowledge, Mises insists, is knowledge from within us, ‚Äúis our own because we are men‚Äú,Human action, p. 64. whereas we are not stones or atoms and so we cannot reflect on what it means to be these things.

His broadway debut was in the original all Asian cast of Pacific Overtures in 1976 where he played Kayama. He was the only non-American member of the cast. In fact, he came to America specifically to audition for this role, after having missed the Tokyo auditions for the musical. Once he was cast, he emigrated to America. Reviews for the show were mixed, but Sato received praise for his performance. He was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical in 1976, but lost to Sammy Williams of A Chorus Line. His voice can be heard on the cast recording of Pacific Overtures. In 1979, he played several roles in the play Fanshen about the Chinese revolution at the ACT Theatre in Seattle. He later played Wenqing in Peking Man, a play by Cao Yu at the Horace Mann Theater in New York City in 1980. At the Perry Street Theater in New York City, he acted in Dick Brukenfeld's historical drama \\"Extenuating Circumstances\\", wherein an American man is accused of killing a young Chinese girl in Canton, China in 1821. Later in his career, he appeared on television in the show Spenser: For Hire on the episode \\"My Brother's Keeper\\", where he was reunited with his Pacific Overtures castmate Mako Iwamatsu. In 1987, he played the scientist in Penn & Teller's TV movie \\"Invisible Thread\\". While touring the West coast with Pacific Overtures, he met his wife Janice Kanemitsu, who was a dancer on the tour. They were married on October 17, 1976 and divorced in 1979.

They initially made radios, and then battery chargers. In 1934 they began to build battery electric road vehicles, producing both cars and milk floats, which were marketed under the Wilson Electric marque. Vehicle production ceased in 1954, but they continued to make chargers and rectifiers. In 1974, they became part of Westinghouse Davenset Rectifiers Ltd, owned by Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd and in 1986 the Leicester site was closed, with manufacturing transferring to Chippenham. At least one of the commercial vehicles and three of the cars have been preserved. History The business of Partridge Wilson Engineering was formed in 1926, by Clifford Partridge and H.G.A. Ross Wilson. The company was located on Loughborough Road, Leicester, and they produced radios. These were marketed as Davensets, as they were radio sets that could pick up broadcasts from the historic transmitter 2LO, which was located at Daventry. By 1930, the number of staff had increased to 7, and the company moved to Evington Valley Road, where they started to produce battery chargers. The chargers automatically regulated the charging current, using a type of gas-filled resistance or Barreter lamp. A review of their products which appeared in the garage equipment section of the Motor Show in 1932 noted that the chargers could be used without removing the battery from the vehicle, and that if the charger was placed underneath the radiator of a commercial vehicle, it would prevent it from freezing in cold weather. Battery-electric road vehicles were added to the Partridge Wilson product line in 1934, and the company expanded quite rapidly, employing some 500 staff by 1945. Following the end of the Second World War, Partridge Wilson embraced a new technology, imported from America, for the fast charging of batteries. They showcased their Davenset fast charger at the 1948 Commercial Motor show. It used a selenium rectifier, came mounted on a wheeled chassis to make it easier to move around a garage, and could charge a starter battery in about an hour. They also exhibited a new pistol grip battery tester. The company became part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd in 1974, and traded as Westinghouse Davenset Rectifiers. The Leicester factory closed in 1986, when manufacturing moved to Chippenham, Wiltshire. Electric road vehicles In 1934 Partridge Wilson produced their first electric van, suitable for a payload of 5-6 cwt, and branded the Wilson Electric. It was fitted with a 29-cell, 129 Amp-hour battery manufactured by Exide Ironclad, and had a range of , with a top speed of . Speed control was arranged by switching of the motor fields and the battery cells, so that a starting resistance to limit the initial current through the motor was not needed. Early customers included the West Ham Electricity Department, who bought two standard chassis in 1934, which were fitted with streamlined bodies by Tomlinson (Marylebone) Ltd. They had a capacity of 5-7 cwt, and were powered by a 24-cell battery made by D P Kathanode driving a Metropolitan-Vickers motor. This arrangement gave a top speed of about and a range of . The Electric Vehicle Committee of Great Britain was established in 1934. Its aim was to promote, develop and protect the electric vehicle industry, not only in Britain, but throughout the British Empire. In recognition of their entry into this field, Partridge Wilson were allowed to appoint a representative to the committee. The first vehicle proved to be a success, and in early 1935, they introduced the MW model, for a 15 cwt payload. The centrally-mounted GEC traction motor drove the rear wheels through a propellor shaft and a Moss overhead-worm type axle. The 60 volt, 192 Amp-hour Exide Ironclad batteries provided a range of . In 1935 they introduced a variant of the MW model, similar to their existing 15 cwt design, but adapted for a payload of 20-25 cwt. The vehicle was powered by Exide Ironclad batteries, with control through floor-mounted accelerator and brake pedals. Pressing the accelerator caused a number of relay contacts to close, at a preselected rate controlled by a fluid dashpot. Despite the increase in payload, they managed to keep the price the same as for the lighter model. As part of their mandate, the Electric Vehicle Committee of Great Britain jointly organised a conference at Southport, Merseyside with the borough electrical engineer of Southport, which took place in December 1935. Partridge Wilson showed their vehicles, as did four other manufacturers, and also showed their chargers, as did the Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company. It was one of several such conferences which were planned to take place. The company increased their prices at the beginning of 1937, by which time they were offering seven vehicles in their LW range, and three in their MW range. =Development= In February 1937, they produced what they claimed was the first all-electric mobile fish-and-chips saloon. Beneath a serving counter was an oven, which was fitted with two sets of electric elements. One set could be plugged into a mains electrical socket, and was used to bring the oven up to temperature. Once it was hot, the second set were powered from the vehicle's battery, but the amount of current drawn was somewhat lower, as it only had to maintain the temperature. Two months later, they showcased a mobile milk bar, complete with egg-whisking machines, fountains and a refrigerator, again powered from the vehicle battery. A milk tank held of milk. Later in the year they held a competition for ideas to improve or develop their products. Prizes of 10, 5 and 3 guineas were offered. The next new vehicle was the 12 cwt Bulldog van, announced in late 1937 and showcased at a convention held in Manchester, again organised by the Electric Vehicle Committee, and hosted at the Salford Corporation Electricity Works. In 1939, the Commercial Motor magazine noted that there were several models available, with payloads from 5 cwt to 18-22 cwt, and that the Wilson-Scammell Electric Horse was in production. This was similar to the Scammell Mechanical Horse which had found favour with railway companies for local deliveries. It was a three-wheeled tractor unit, which could be coupled to a two-wheeled trailer, fitted with a van body or a flat bed. The trailer could carry 4 tons, and the vehicle had a range of , based on five stops per mile. Road speed was around when fully laden, and the speed was controlled by a mechanical controller, with no electro-mechanical contactors. The Wilson Spaniel was demonstrated at a meeting at Wanstead, London in April 1939. The chassis, which was based on their SLW model, was rated at 8-9 cwt, and Wilson's only offered them in fleets of six vehicles. The Exide Ironclad batteries were charged using a Davenset 3-phase group charger. In early 1940, they were at the fourth annual exhibition of battery-electric vehicles, held in Manchester. The vehicle they showcased was a streamlined van, which could hold light parcels. They had developed a new type of controller, called the Wilson Monopac, which gave good acceleration, with no \\"snatch\\" when starting. The lack of a heavy payload gave it a range of . =War years= By 1943, Partridge Wilson were producing vehicles with payloads of 7/10 cwt, 15 cwt, 18/25 cwt, and 40 cwt. The first three were aimed at the retail delivery market, and so were mainly supplied as bread vans and milk floats, while the 40 cwt model was designed as a lorry. All models were fitted with series traction motors and Bendix brakes. The 7/10 cwt model included a drum-type controller, with a constant delay between the stages. The larger vehicles used a fluid foot controller to regulate the speed of the vehicle. By this time they were using starting resistances, which were switched out of circuit as a camshaft on the controller rotated. Power was transmitted to the rear axle through a propellor shaft with Hardy-Spicer flexible couplings and a spiral bevel gear. On the larger models, the propellor shaft had Hardy-Spicer needle- roller joints, and was connected to an overslung worm drive on the rear axle. There was also a 30 cwt lorry with a tipping body available, although Hills in his summary of electric vehicles gives no further details, and the Wilson- Scammell electric horse was still in production. The war years presented a number of challenges. A number of companies worked together through the Standardization Sub-Committee of the Electric Vehicle Association, to produce a specification for a standard vehicle, following a recommendation by the Ministry of Supply. The result was a vehicle where every part had been standardized, and could be made by any of the manufacturers. The design included a four-speed delay action controller, operated hydraulically by a foot pedal, which was manufactured by Partridge Wilson. Other companies involved in the consultation included Brush, Metropolitan-Vickers, Midland Electric Vehicles, Morrison-Electricar and Victor Electrics. However, by 1943, restrictions meant that new battery-electric vehicles could only be supplied to essential users, and the quota for 1943 was just 500 vehicles in total. Special permission was given to build three prototypes of the standard vehicle, which made its debut in January 1944. It could carry a payload of 20 cwt, and tests had shown that it had a range of . After a demonstration, Sir Felix Pole, president of the Electric Vehicle Association, and a number of others, including Mr H G Wilson of Partridge Wilson, who had chaired the standardization sub-committee, met with Lord Leathers, the Minister of War Transport. Although no clear end to the war was in sight, Partridge Wilson were already looking to a time when it would be over, and circulated a questionnaire to most of the larger seaside resorts in 1944, to gauge support for an idea that they were proposing. They suggested that fleets of battery- electric single deck passenger vehicles could be used to offer tourists the chance to go sightseeing or to tour the town in which they were staying. A number of positive responses were received, and it was suggested that the presence of such vehicles would promote the sales of electric goods vehicles. =Post-war demise= After a gap of 11 years, the Commercial Motor show was held again in 1948, and Partridge Wilson used it to display the Wilson Beavermajor chassis. This was a 25 cwt vehicle, with a range of . The batteries, which were mounted between the frames, powered a motor, which was located behind the cab. Suspension was provided by semi-elliptic springs, and the vehicle was the first battery-electric to use Girling mechanical-hydro brakes, a system where the front brakes were hydraulically operated, while the rear brakes were controlled mechanically. The control panel gave four forward and reverse speeds, with delays between the transition from one speed to the next being automatic. In early 1949, Mr E E Grant, who had worked for Partridge Wilson for 20 years, moved to join Hindle Smart and Co in Manchester, to develop their range of electric vehicles. The range was stated to be the Helecs, which was Hindle Smart's own product, the Jen-Helecs, which they had built for Jensen Motors, and the Wilson. Hindle Smart had also purchased the goodwill of the Sunbeam battery-electrics. Another indication of links between the two companies was an advert in Commercial Motor magazine on 1 July 1949, which mentioned that there was a Jen-Helecs drivers club, for drivers of Jen-Helecs, Sunbeam and Wilson Electric vehicles. Membership entitled the user to a free badge. Wilson Electrics were shown at two further exhibitions. These were the 1950 Commercial Motor show, where two Wilson Major 25 cwt vehicles were on display, one a milk float and the other a bread van, and the International Bakers' and Confectioners' Exhibition, held at Olympia in October 1951, where they displayed 15 cwt and 25 cwt vehicles. The 15 cwt model was a bread van, and was en route to the Uganda Electricity Board, where it would act as a demonstrator. Wilson Electric vehicles ceased to be produced in 1954. =Battery-electric cars= Partridge Wilson produced a small number of battery-electric cars around 1935. The bodywork was designed by Arthur Mulliner, and looked like a petrol car in its styling. It was fitted with a 64-volt battery, which provided a range of about and a top speed of . It was comparatively expensive, at nearly twice the price of a Morris Ten, and only 40 vehicles were sold. Preservation There is a Wilson Electric vehicle on display at The Transport Museum, Wythall, near Birmingham. It is a model BMW 10-cwt bread van, registration number LBC 136, which was built in 1954 for Frears & Blacks bakery. An earlier vehicle, originally supplied to the Electricity Department of Coventry Corporation in 1935, but converted into an ice-cream van in 1947 by Cox's Ices, was on display at the Snibston Discovery Museum until its closure in 2015. It carries the registration number AWK 230. Two of the electric cars are also preserved, both owned by the same collector, who lives in Devon. Wilson also produced an experimental cabriolet in 1936, which is also preserved in Devon.

He dedicated his life to improving education for African Americans and his prowess in teaching allowed him to make great strides in providing better and equal education. In addition to teaching, Atkins worked to better his community by improving the health, housing, and economic status of the African American community.  Early life  Born to two former slaves, Atkins was born into slavery on a farm in North Carolina rented by his former master, Capt. E. Bryan. In 1880, after many years of public education, Atkins enrolled at St. Augustine's Normal and Collegiate Institute in Raleigh, North Carolina. Here, he was introduced to Anna Julia Cooper, an accomplished student at St. Augustine's college, who mentored Atkins and inspired him to continue pursuing education. With Cooper's help, at the young age of 17, Atkins began his teaching career at a rural public school in North Carolina.  Education  Atkins first began his education from his earliest years of attending schooling in Haywood, NC, where he progressed to top of his class. After teaching at a local school, he then enrolled at St. Augustine's College Raleigh, NC in 1880.  Career  Atkins' career began in 1880, when he began teaching at a rural school in North Carolina. After graduating from St. Augustine's College, Atkins was offered a teaching position in his hometown of Chatham County. There, his dedication to his work was recognized by Dr. J. C. Price, and in 1884, Price brought him to Livingstone College in Salisbury and offered him the job of head of the grammar school. Atkins served as the head of the grammar department for six years and during the last two years of his time there, worked as the treasurer of the college. While serving as principal at Depot Street Public School in Winston-Salem, NC, which was the largest public grammar school for African-Americans in NC, Atkins began his work to improve living conditions for African Americans. In 1892, him and his wife, Oleona, were the first settlers in the Columbian Heights neighborhood, where Atkins would establish a community that would be serve as a \\"center of mutual understanding, respect, and regard of one race for the other.\\" The new area proved to be a suitable environment for a new school. In 1892, in Columbian Heights, Atkins founded the Slater Industrial Academy, now Winston-Salem State University, where he served as president for over 30 years (1892-1904 and 1913-1934).  Legacy  In 2011, Winston-Salem State University established the Simon Green Atkins Society to honor those that make significant contributions ($1,000 or more) to the university. This money supports the university's most important priorities. In addition to the Simon Green Atkins Society, WSSU also implemented the Simon Green Atkins Scholars Society, an undergraduate program of both curricular and co-curricular aspects as well as many experimental learning initiatives. The goal of the program is to provide \\"personal attention, top faculty, enlightening seminars, illuminating study- abroad experiences, numerous research opportunities, and career-building internships,\\" in order to enhance education experience and prepare students for their future. A house Atkins built in Winston-Salem in 1893, now known as the S. G. Atkins House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Simon G. Atkins Academic & Technology High School, a magnet high school in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is named for Atkins.

Throughout her life she advocated for her tribe, helping to improve educational opportunity and economic development as well as promoting a resurgence of appropriation for Indian culture and heritage.  Childhood and early life  Priscilla Freeman Jacobs was born in 1940 to Clifton Freeman and Vara Patrick and was the first born of her 3 other siblings. They grew up in the Ricefield area of the Waccamaw-Siouan community, about 37 miles from Wilmington, North Carolina where her family made a living through logging and forestry. At 9 years old Jacobs traveled to Washington, DC with a delegation of the Waccamaw-Siouan community to ask federal recognition from the US Congress to stand as an Indian Tribe. However, the bill did not pass. After her father, Clifton Freeman, became chief in 1941, she accompanied him to many country wide meetings, learning about the challenges her people faced and watching as he worked to secure jobs, and improve infrastructure for the Waccamaw-Siouan. She was educated in the American Indian schools, a local school, (open from the 1920s-1960s) which primarily taught literacy, mathematics, history and respect for her heritage and then studied secretarial work at the Miller Mott Businesses College of Wilmington. After graduating, she returned home to work for her fathers logging business and in 1961, she married Welton Jacobs who was also Waccamaw-Siouan. They had two children: Ray Freeeman and Welton Jacobs.  Career  Throughout the 1960s Jacobs and her father worked to re-introduce the pan-Indian powwow as a way to bring solidarity and recognition to the Tribes. Finally in 1970 Jacobs, led the group who organized the first modern Waccamaw-Siouan powwow. This was a big step in regaining the identity of the Waccamaw-Siouan after the Indian schools had been closed. In Jacobs' own words: > \\"[The purpose was]... to revive our Indian culture. This was a way of doing > it - of letting people see... It was our intention to bring [Indian] people > together for fellowship, to see what each other was doing, to share our arts > and crafts with one another, [to share] the progress.\\" After the loss of the Indian schools this was seen as the greatest thing to unify around. The Waccamw Sioux have organized their powwow annually each October since 1970.Bonney, Rachel, and Paredes, J. Anthony, eds. Contemporary American Indians : Anthropologists and Indians in the New South. Tuscaloosa, US: University Alabama Press, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 5 October 2016. In 1974 Jacobs acquired five acres of land from the International Paper Company to use as the Waccamaw center of tribal life. Today that area has grown to thirty acres and includes a daycare, office, and ball field. This ownership of the Waccamaw culture was a part of the larger national cultural renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s which was characterized by the growing participation in powwows and the emergence of a national generalized Indian Identity. Jacobs succeeded her father as chief of the Waccamaw-Siouan when she was 45, after his death in November 1985. Although her brothers were next in line for the chieftainship, they declined, choosing instead to focus on running the family's logging business. Her inauguration as chief was held at Frontier Fort near Wilmington in 1986 making her the first female chief of the Waccamaw Sioux and one of very few in the country. Her tribal board was made up mostly of family. Jacobs adamant activism is partially responsible for the formation of the N.C. Commission of Indian Affairs and she acted as the first secretary of the commissions board of directors and later on she became community developer. Between 1971 and 1973, she represented the Waccamaw Sioux at the Coalition for Eastern Native Americans alongside her father. She was a participant in the N.C. Indian Unity Conference and was part of the collaborative force that formed the Waccamaw-Siouan Development Association (WSDA) whose goal is to develop programs for and improve education, economic development, and culture. Not only was Jacobs a social and political figurehead for her tribe but she was also a spiritual leader. She grew up in the christian church and with the influence from her grandfather, Riley T. Freeman, who was a bible school teacher, she carried that throughout her whole life. She was a minister as well as bookkeeper and secretary before she became chief and her faith is deeply interwoven with her pride in her Indian heritage. She ceased to be chief in 2005.

London: Pavilion Books Limited, 1995. The good climate and soil meant that the south of the peninsula was coveted by the Norsemen and Normans because it had \\"great plentie\\" of corn and cattleLockley, R.M.: The Regional Books: Pembrokeshire, pages 49-50. London: Robert Hale & Company, 1972. The county has prime agricultural land, much of which is located at about 70m above sea level, while to the north, the Preseli Hills rise to 500m above sea level and form uplands that are made up of heather and bracken, which are used for grazing sheep.Pressdee, Colin: Food Wales: A Second Helping, page 76. Cardiff: Graffeg Books, 2008. Consequently, Pembrokeshire is classed as one of the most fertile counties in Wales, with its 392,300 agricultural acres having 14% of its land classed as of good quality, 67% being classed as medium quality and 19% being classed as poor quality.Lockley, page 128 However, agricultural production is subject to market forces and in the 1890s, as a result of the Panic of 1893, a deep agricultural depression led to the area under cultivation falling by a third. Many labourers and farmers had no option but to emigrate to the New World and many of the large farming estates were sold. World War I brought prosperity again, but by the 1930s, as a result of the Great Depression, there was another agricultural depression which lasted until World War II. During the Post-war period agriculture has benefited from marketing schemes and marketing boards, which have helped in the regulation, marketing and distribution of the county's agricultural production.Lockley, page 21 Simmental bull waiting to be judged at the Fishguard show Today, the county is well known for its excellent food, having capitalised on the quality of its agricultural produce. Gilli Davies notes that Fishguard is known as a mecca for the gourmet, while St Davids has developed a reputation in recent years as a centre for good food shops and Milford Haven is known for its range of local foods and delicatessen items.Davies, page 147. Meat and poultry The Pembrokeshire coast is made up of high cliffs, large bays, small coves and estuaries backed by rolling pastures which are good for dairy farming.Davies, page 144 The interior of the county is dominated by the River Teifi and its valley of dairy and mixed farms.Pressdee, Colin: Colin Pressdee's Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 12. London: BBC Books, 1995. Sheep are kept on most farms, with the larger farms of the south of the county favouring breeds such as Clun Forest sheep, Suffolk sheep and Cheviot sheep, while in the north, the farms of the Preseli Hills are stocked with Welsh Mountain sheepLockley, page 22 thumb Boys evacuated from London help to feed the cattle on a farm in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1940 Pembrokeshire also produces beefPressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery\\", page 100 from breeds such as Welsh Black cattle, a native cattle breed. This breed has developed, in part, from the extinct breed known as Pembroke cattle. Gilli Davies notes that, in Pembrokeshire, the Welsh Black cattle grow to a large size and are good milk producers, due to the county's rich pasture. This led to Welsh Black cattle in Pembrokeshire being recognised as a distinct race and the Welsh Black of Castlemartin, Pembrokeshire now have their own herd book. By the nineteenth century the breed had developed into two distinct strains: the smaller the North Wales variety and the bigger Castlemartin, or South Wales, type.Davies, page 144. However, R. M. Lockley noted that, by the twentieth century, the long horns and dual purpose nature of the Welsh Black made it less popular. Farm specialisation meant that the breed was substituted for specialised beef or milk breeds. Hereford (cattle) became popular for beef production while Friesian cattle were used for milk production.Lockley, pages 49-50 However, the Welsh Black has since made a comeback and is regaining in popularity, with Welsh Black meat now sold across the county at retail outlets and farm shops. A Misericord in St Davids Cathedral depicting a merchant receiving a meal of a pig's head, served by a female servant. Colin Pressdee notes that Pembrokeshire is also known for its poultry, with the Pembrokeshire turkey having become as well known as Aylesbury duck.Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery \\", page 12 Geese were also commonly kept, with the county once having a reputation for its Michaelmas Geese, which were also known as Green Geese. These were once to be found on every farm, village green and piece of common land in the county.Lockley, page 23 Poultry, including hens and turkeys, continue to provide an important side-line to Pembrokeshire farming, especially on the medium and smaller farms Fish The coastline of Pembrokeshire has an extensive wild fishery with small fishing fleets traditionally operating out of Fishguard, St Davids, Solva, Tenby and Milford Haven. The larger fishing trawlers operate from Milford Haven, which was recognised by Lord Nelson as \\"one of the greatest natural harbours in the world\\".Pressdee, Food Wales \\", page 75 In 1890, there were 1,660 fishing vessels using Milford Haven's docks and it became one of Britain's most successful fishing ports. However, Milford Haven became less busy after World War II, although in 1950 its trawlers still landed about 5-6% of the UK's wet fish (chiefly European hake) and had the UK's fifth largest fleet. Milford Haven now acts mainly as a base for foreign-registered trawlers which export most of their catch to continental markets. The trawlers and small fishing craft bring prosperity to Milford Haven and exploit the hake-fishery of the west coast and south-west of Ireland, with herring being landed in season.Lockley, page 108 Prime fish landed at the port includes common sole, turbot, plaice, monkfish and European seabass, which fetch high prices. The smaller trawlers catch crab, lobster, crayfish, herring, whiting (merlangius), pollock and salmon, or line fish for mackerel. The old fish market at Milford Haven docks has closed but a smaller, trade only, market has opened instead. Milford Haven also has a marina and restaurants. Fishguard harbour is the ferry port for Ireland and is a commercial centre, but according to Pressdee the wild coast from St Davids to St Brides Bay houses the best secrets of the entire coastline.Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery\\", page 12 He considers North Pembrokeshire to be more rugged and beautiful than the south. It also has a number of fishing ports which once exported stone from the limestone and slate quarries of the area. These ports, such as Porthgain, Abereiddy, Pen Clegyr and Tresinwen now have small fleets of working craft and pleasure boats. They serve local pubs and restaurants that produce fresh seafood and farm produce and which vary with the season and tides. Pressdee cites The Harbour Lights Restaurant at Porthgain, Jemima's near Haverfordwest and Tates in Fishguard as popular examples of such places.Davies, pages 144 ‚Äì 145 Sculpture of herrings, overlooking Fishguard harbour, and erected in recognition of the harbour's fishing and trading history, the sculpture is by John Cleal and was erected in 2006 (photo by Pauline Eccles). The winter herring industry gives large landings of fish, especially around the estuary of the River Cleddau at Llangwm, Pembrokeshire. This was once an important component of the county's inshore fishery, with the catch being made into kippers and bloater (herring) at Milford Haven's fish docks.Pressdee, Food Wales \\", page 81 At Llangwm the inhabitants formerly lived exclusively by fishing cockle (bivalve)s, oysters, mussels and clams collected at low tide from the Llangwm boats, which were the modern equivalent of the British osier or coracle.Lockley, page 104 Oysters are an important shellfish crop and the principal oyster beds were found at Penna Mouth, Lawrenny, Llangwm and Milford Haven. They were once delivered by packhorse throughout South Wales. Farmed rock oysters, a Pacific species, have been used to re-stock some oyster beds, although native oysters are making a comeback around Carew, Pembrokeshire and Benton Castle at Milford Haven.Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery\\", page 18 However, the shellfish industry has disappeared from around the Llangwm part of the coast. Seabirds were once taken for food and, because they came from the sea and lived on fish, they were regarded as fish for religious purposes, when meat was required to be replaced with fish in the diet.Lockley, page 64 Fruit and vegetables The English built their castles across Pembrokeshire to defend the south of the county from the Welsh to the north. The boundary that developed, known as the Landsker Line, follows the January isotherm (contour line) of 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Below this line the milder winters promote the growth of winter crops.Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery\\", page 11 This means that farmers can grow new grass earlier in the year than other parts of the county.Davies, page 142 It also means that early new potatoes can become an important cash crop, subject to competition from earlier crops of potatoes imported from the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Pembrokeshire early potatoes in plastic bags produced by Blas y Tir The main crops are early potatoes, winter brassicas and root vegetables with the harvesting period being between end of October and mid-May.Davies, page 142. South Pembrokeshire is known for its root vegetables and Pressdee notes that, until recently, there were not many recipes using them, although dishes such as creamed swede have since become popular.Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery\\", page 128 Other Pembrokeshire crops include cauliflower, asparagus and soft fruitPressdee, Food Wales \\", page 76 Cauliflowers require a frost free climate when the curd is developing and the mild climate of Pembrokeshire means that it is an important local crop, with the county supplying this vegetable to national markets.Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery\\", page 137 Barley field. Barley growing below Castell Mawr Hillfort, Pembrokeshire Central Pembrokeshire, from the River Cleddau estuary to the west coast, grows cereals for cattle, while most coastal farms are laid down to 50% arable land and with 40% under short ley farming, with 10% permanent pasture close to the farm. The arable rotation often included early potatoes, in the first and second years, sometimes with sugar beet or broccoli in the same year, when the potatoes are taken out in June, then three corn crops, the last under sown with a three-years ley, the sequence may be varied, depending on the price of early potatoes, broccoli and sugar beet. Oats are the most popular crop, followed by early potatoes, barley for seed, wheat and sugar beet. Pembrokeshire has also produced a number of varieties of Welsh apples, including Pren Glas and Pig Aderyn. These two varieties are from St Dogmaels. Pren Glas is an early season eating apple, while Pig Aderyn is a mid-season eating apple with scarlet stripes and a top that resembles a bird's beak (pig aderyn). Two other Pembrokeshire varieties include Wern and Pigeon's Beak. Wern is an early dessert apple variety of nineteenth century origin which is good for eating and cooking. Pigeon's Beak (Pig y golomen) is said to originate from Pembrokeshire but is also found in Denbigh and Anglesey. Other apple and fruit varieties may exist and await rediscovery. Milk, cheese and ice cream After World War I, when corn prices collapsed due to the depression, many farms moved into milk production in order to benefit from the guaranteed prices offered by the Milk Marketing Board. This suited the sheltered inland valley farms, with high rainfall, which are well suited to grass production. This led to many small farms producing milk and reducing their arable acreage. However, over-production led to the introduction of milk quotas, which had a positive side-effect, in that it led to a growth in specialist and small scale artisan cheese making in Pembrokeshire.Pressdee, Food Wales \\", page 83 Calon Wen (which means White Heart) is a Welsh co- operative of dairy farmers who established themselves in order to sell milk to local people and comprises 20 members in north and south-west Wales and is based in Narberth, Pembrokeshire.

History Country house cuisine has been recorded in a number of historical recipe books from the county. Anne Phelps of Withybush House, Haverfordwest (now demolished), compiled a recipe book in about 1770. Recipes include Haricot Mutton, Green Pea Soup and Baked Beef.Freeman, Bobby: Traditional Foods From Wales, page 288. New York: Hippocrene Books Inc., 1997. An eighteenth century cook book associated with Slebech Hall (also demolished) includes recipes such as Cream Pancakes, Baked Herrings, Mr Anson's Pudding (Mr Anson was related to the owners of Slebech and later became Earl of Lichfield), Lemon Sponge, Boodle Club Cake (associated with Boodle's, London) and Amber Pudding.Freeman, pages 295-300 A recipe book from Stackpole Court (also demolished, although the Stackpole Estate remains) includes recipes such as The Duke of Marlborough's White Fish Sauce, Doctor Oliver's Biscuits, A recipe for currie, A patty, British champagne (made from gooseberries) and Duke of Norfolk's Punch (drink).Freeman, pages 301-309 In 2009, the actress and television presenter Jenny Kenna published \\"Susan's Secrets, A Victorian Kitchen in Wales\\". Her great grandmother, Susan Elizabeth Webb, was a cook who started work at age fifteen in Victorian era Pembrokeshire and kept a notebook of recipes popular at that time. The book also sets out her grandmother's story.Kenna, Jenny: A Victorian Kitchen in Wales. Cardiff: Ceiniog Press, 2009. The Withybush, Slebech and Stackpole cook books are held by Pembrokeshire Records Office. \\"Traditional Food From Wales\\", a book on Welsh cuisine by Bobby Freeman (writer and cook), contains the recipes mentioned above. Freeman, originally from England, ran a \\"pioneering Fishguard restaurant\\" in the 1960s which specialised in Welsh cuisine and she went on to write numerous books on Welsh cookery. According to Freeman, all the hand written recipe collections compiled in Welsh country houses in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries \\"are no different from their counterparts compiled in English mansions and do not contain a single reference to traditional Welsh dishes or methods of cooking\\".Freeman, page 16 This led to Freeman's \\"long search to authenticate Welsh cookery\\" much of which was passed orally from mother to daughter\\".Freeman, page 14 According to Freeman, the first record of Welsh cuisine, since the Laws of Hywel Dda and the poets of Medieval Welsh literature, was written down in the prize winning Eisteddfod entry of Mati Thomas, in 1928. Freeman arranged for the translation of this work, which is a unique collection of very old Welsh recipes collected from the memories of Welsh cooks while they were still alive to recall them.

Pembrokeshire recipes Original Pembrokeshire recipes include: Katt Pies, these are lamb and dried fruit pies traditionally eaten while droving livestock on the route between Wales and London and sold at fairs throughout South Wales. They became particularly associated with the Templeton Fair, held annually in Pembrokeshire on 12 November. Pembrokeshire Faggots are savoury faggots made with pig's liver, suet, breadcrumbs and onions. They were popular after pig-killing in Pembrokeshire in the nineteenth century.Jones, John: Croeso Cymreig, A Welsh Welcome, Recipes For Some Traditional Welsh Dishes, page 14. Cardiff: John Jones Publishing Ltd, 1986. Pembrokeshire laverbread cakes are made from pan- fried Laver bread, oats and lemon Migiod, or yeast buns, are traditional to Pembrokeshire and were part of the New Year celebrations in the past. They are eaten warm and glazed with melted honey.Freeman, Bobby: Welsh Country Cookery, Traditional Recipes from the Country Kitchens of Wales, page 14. Talybont, Ceredigion: Y Lolfa, 1988.() Traditions associated with St David The vegetarian diet has a long tradition in Pembrokeshire, being linked with the cult of St David. In the ‚ÄúLife of St David‚Äù written by Rhygyfarch it is recorded that, after a day of manual labourWyn Evans, J., and Wooding, Jonathan M.

St David lived on bread, water and herbs, as did each subsequent Bishop of St David's until bishop Morgeneu I broke the tradition and was, as a consequence, slain in 999.Wade-Evans, A.

Noted as one of the first African women in South Africa to hold a solo exhibition, she was a pioneer in visual arts in her country, for which she was given the Presidential Order of Ikhamanga in Silver. As a self-taught artist, she drew influences from her cultural background and the landscape around her. Early life Gladys Mgudlandlu was born in the Peddie district near Grahamstown in 1917 (some sources give 1923 or 1925). She was raised mainly by her grandmother, who taught her traditional painting styles from their Xhosa and Fingo heritage, and about the birds native to their region. She qualified as a teacher in 1941, at Lovedale College. She was also registered as a nurse-in- training in Cape Town in the 1940s.Joe Dolby, \\"Gladys Mgudlandlu\\" REvisions. Mgudlandlu worked as an art teacher in Langa, Cape Town at the Athlone Bantu Community School for fifteen years. However, when the Bantu Education Act of 1953 was enforced, Mgudlandlu was not allowed to teach at the school under the apartheid regime. Prior to dedicating herself to art full-time, she went to teach briefly at schools in Nyanga and Gugulethu. Career Mgudlandlu taught at Athlone Bantu Community School until 1953, and at Nyanga West Primary School from 1953. She painted at night after work. Mgudlandlu‚Äôs style was influenced by her grandmother‚Äôs indigenous painting techniques. As a child, her grandmother who was a muralist taught her about visual art. Her grandmother‚Äôs death, seen by some as not only a great loss but a liberation for Mugudlandlu, sparked a sort of artistic awakening. Mgudlandlu draws from her rural childhood, and depicts her memories of youth in a dream-like state. Her works feature indigenous birds, rural landscapes, and depictions of vibrant African villages. She loved birds and was often called unontaka which means \\"the bird lady\\" in . In an interview by the Sunday Chronicle, she said \\"Birds have always been my companions. I am a very lonely person. They are the only real friends that I have had. Sometimes I think I should have been a bird. I even paint like a bird. You will notice that all my landscapes are done from a bird‚Äôs view, high up and far away\\". She described her painting style as a mix between Impressionism and Expressionism, although a ‚Äúdreamer imaginist\\" is what she liked to be called. With just a paraffin lamp, the artist would work and create art. She never used electricity and would continue this tradition throughout her career. Her work contained two main vantage points: ground level and a bird's eye view. When painting from a ground level vantage point, she would paint animals while her high vantage points painting's subjects were landscapes. These landscapes were inspired by her childhood ventures, climbing up on mountains and rocks. She was exhibiting in the early 1960s, enough for Bessie Head to comment from exile in Botswana in 1963 that Mgudlandlu's work was \\"escapist,\\" \\"childish,\\" and aimed at white audiences. Her introductory solo exhibition was in Cape Town in 1961 at the Liberal Party offices in Parliament Street. Before this initial exhibition of Mgudlandlu's work, no black female artist had been recognized exhibiting in a Western art tradition, they had all remained anonymous. The medium of the works exhibited in the were gouache. Mgudlandlu herself claimed that she was a first; \\"I think that I can claim to be the first African woman in the country to hold an exhibition,\\" she told a newspaper in 1962. \\"As far as I know, I am the only African woman who has taken painting seriously.\\"\\"Gladys Nomfanekiso Mgudlandlu\\" LifewithArt.com. This characterization has been found to be inaccurate by art historians.Tamara Warren, \\"Nontobeko Ntombela and the Art of Curating\\" Life & Times (15 May 2012). After being injured in a car accident in 1971, Mgudlandlu stopped painting and showing her works.Smithsonian Institution Libraries, Monographs on African Artists: An Annotated Bibliography.

Death and legacy Mgudlandlu died at Guguletu in 1979, aged 61 years. In 2007, Mgudlandlu was posthumously awarded the Presidential Order of Ikhamanga in Silver for her contributions to South African art.Order of Ikhamanga, The Presidency, Republic of South Africa. A biography by Elza Miles, Nomfanekiso Who Paints at Night: The Art of Gladys Mgudlandlu was published in 2003.Elza Miles, Nomfanekiso Who Paints at Night: The Art of Gladys Mgudlandlu (Fernwood Press 2003). A show of works by Mgudlandlu and Valerie Desmore, titled \\"A Fragile Archive,\\" was on display at Johannesburg Art Gallery in 2012.\\"Exhibition Examines SA's Past\\" Joburg.org.za (17 January 2012). Filmmaker Kemang Wa Lehulere made \\"The Bird Lady\\" (2015), a short documentary about Mgudlandlu.Mary Corrigall, \\"Award-winning Artist's Focus Forerunners\\" IOL (10 July 2015). Works by Mgudlandlu are in the collections of the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum.About the Collection, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum. Mgudlandlu herself and her exhibitions have provided historians and the general public with the current understanding of rural and township life in the recent past. This is because she drew inspiration from her Xhosa heritage and the customs/rituals that she grew up learning [. Unfortunately, many of her works have deteriorated over time because they were primarily in gouache on card.  Two Blue Birds  Gladys Mgudlandlu often depicted birds, the subject matter of her gouache on card painting Two Blue Birds, a work shown in her 1962 Exhibition at the Rodin Gallery in Cape Town. In a Mgudlandlu quote shared by Michael Stevenson, Mgudlandlu expresses her affinity with the creatures, \\"Birds have always been my companions‚Ä¶ I am a very lonely person. They are the only real friends I have had. Sometimes I think I should have been a bird. I even paint like a bird. You will notice that my landscapes are done from a bird‚Äôs view, high up and far away\\"  Houses in the Hills  Houses in the Hills(1971) depicts ugly and oppressive houses that are the antithesis of the organic homes of the traditional African homesteads. These houses are the products of apartheid and \\"glare accusingly at the viewer\\". The discord between the yellow-browns and blue-purples serve to accentuate the harsh mood.  Gugulethu  Gugulethu (1964) is a work similar to many other landscapes by Mgudlandlu in which she depicts houses that are the results of the apartheid. These type of works can be seen as idealizations, but looking closer reveals that Mgudlandlu had constructed them to convey intentional bizarre qualities. Her work was deemed intuitive and not intentional, meaning her choices were often looked over. The clear nod to impressionism and post-impressionism is seen in the cubism-esque,repetitive and exploratory brushstrokes that can also be found in European post- impressionist artist's works such as Cezanne. The chaos and disorder of this township \\"play upon the rules of perspective\\". Her bird's eye view perspective can be seen here and is thought of as an expression of her personal sadness and disappointment with these living conditions, as well as a \\"desire for liberation\\".

It started with fifty-three beds and about half of its cases were maternity patients. In 1958 it became the Louise Margaret Maternity Hospital, and closed in 1995. The old hospital is part of a group of historic buildings with legal protection and, as of 2016, is expected to be used in a redevelopment project. History = Early years = Nurses and other staff of the new hospital, 1898 The \\"lying-in\\" or post-natal ward c1908 The Duchess of Connaught, formerly Princess Louise Margaret, laid the foundation stone for the hospital bearing her name on 1 March 1897, just as her husband, the Duke of Connaught, was taking over Aldershot Command. She declared the new building open on 25 July 1898 in a ceremony with a military band, guard of honour and a service with three clergymen. A bouquet of pink roses was presented by an officer's daughter before the Matron, Miss Hodgson, and the Commanding Officer, William Watson Pike, a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps, showed her round.'New Hospital at Aldershot', Dover Express, 29 July 1898, p.2 The new yellow-brick building with slate roofs echoed the construction materials used by its larger neighbour, the Cambridge Military Hospital. It cost ¬£12,600 to buildSevenoaks Chronicle and Kentish Advertiser, 29 July 1898 and had \\"sanitary blocks\\" incorporated in \\"Italianate\\" corner towers towards the back. There were fifty- three beds arranged in eleven wards of different sizes, including wards named for Queen Victoria, the Duke of Connaught and Lord Lansdowne. The staircases had shallow steps, supposed to help nurses in long dresses run up and down. A \\"fine\\" tiled operating theatre was added in 1908 and officially opened by the Duchess in 1909. It had a new sort of \\"brilliant light\\" and Doulton basins and sinks \\"fitted with the latest kind of mixing valves for hot and cold water with elbow-action and sprays\\". Within a couple of years the hospital was treating around 1000 cases annually: about half in its General Division and half in its Maternity Division which had twenty-five \\"swing cots\\" along with twenty-five beds. As well as the Matron or Lady Superintendent there were fourteen nurses in 1908. All were qualified but seven of them were short-term appointees doing additional training in midwifery. The hospital was already an officially recognised midwifery training school preparing twenty nurses a year for the Central Midwives Board examination. By 1912 there were two weekly clinics: one for tooth extraction and one for \\"special gynaecological outpatients\\". = The 1920s and 1930s = Children's ward c1908 with rocking horse Queen Mary on the Queen Mary Wing in 1926 A 1926 extension with rooms for officers' wives and children was intended to offer medical facilities at \\"moderate charges\\" to women of the officer class, matching what was available to their menfolk.'Hospital For Officers' Wives', The Times, 6 Jan, 1927, p. 7 Queen Mary was said to be interested in this new policy of the military authorities and granted permission for a new extension to be called the Queen Mary Wing. This wing was in fact two separate \\"unpretentious\\" extensions to east and west which blended in with the original building and provided accommodation for up to six women and eight children.'The Queen's Visit To Aldershot', The Times, 22 May 1926 p. 15 The Queen made donations towards it: a cheque, linen and silver plate with her crest on. She also presented the hospital with a rocking horse and brass cot once used by Edward VIII. After unveiling a stone tablet in the wall and naming the new wing, she continued to visit the hospital regularly, as she had already been doing for several years. Her visits to the hospital and to a nearby children's home named after her could be combined with frequent royal visits to inspect military activities like cavalry training.'Their Majesties At Aldershot', The Times, 15 July 1910, p. 10 In 1928, when the British Medical Association was promoting the benefits of antenatal care, they used the Louise Margaret Hospital as a good example. In a group of 2000 women who gave birth there, all but one had had antenatal care and there were only two maternal deaths.'Saving the Lives of Mothers', Yorkshire Evening Post, 23 July 1928, p. 9 Similar claims of successful outcomes of antenatal care at the hospital were made in 1924 by the commanding officer of the time, Edward L. Moss. 1928 was also the year that the matron, Agnes Charlotte Markwick, was awarded the Royal Red Cross. She was a member of the Queen Alexandra‚Äôs Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS). The previous decades had seen the nursing staff becoming more integrated with the QAIMNS. The matron who preceded Markwick, Edith Mary Beesby, was at the Louise Margaret by 1910, and, while still there, was made a matron of the Queen Alexandra Military Families Nursing Service in 1921. A nurses' home was built next door in 1937 and joined to the hospital with a single-storey brick corridor. Money from the Aldershot Tattoo helped fund the hospital and other military welfare projects via the Aldershot Command Charities Trust. = The 1950s = In the early 1950s newborn babies at the hospital had a room off the maternity ward and were \\"all carefully numbered and ticketed\\". They slept in \\"a series of wooden trays set round the walls\\", according to the writer John Hay Beith. The babies' bathroom had basins where a nurse could control the water by foot, leaving both hands free for handling the baby. In the era of the National Health Service it was no longer appropriate to charge officers' families for using the Queen Mary Wing. Not only was the \\"private\\" accommodation free but rooms were sometimes available \\"for the dependants of Other Ranks\\". Beith reported that Queen Alexandra military nurses enjoyed a posting here as a \\"welcome alternative to nursing men only\\". He also described volunteer welfare officers helping with occupational and recreational therapy. In 1958 general nursing was discontinued and it became the Louise Margaret Maternity Hospital. Royal attention continued in this period with Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret both visiting. = Recent history = The derelict Louise Margaret Hospital in 2016 In the 1980s administrators made the Louise Margaret an \\"annexe\\" to the Cambridge Hospital next door. The last baby was born there in 1995, shortly before the hospital closed for ever on the 18 January. It was soon sold to the local authority, Rushmoor Council, who are treating it as a historic building of local importance, given extra weight by its relationship to nearby buildings, especially the Cambridge Hospital. They have carried out detailed conservation and heritage surveys with a view to redeveloping not only the hospital but adjacent sites too. Council planning documents support the idea of removing all post-1926 additions and turning the Louise Margaret Hospital into housing.

It was released in September 1996. The game is a spin-off of The Oregon Trail. It is the second video game in the Amazon Trail video game series, succeeding The Amazon Trail and preceding Amazon Trail 3rd Edition. It was included in a games bundle with the Quantex 5500, and in the Trail Mix Social Studies Bundle with The Oregon Trail 3rd Edition and MayaQuest: The Mystery Trail. The Quantex QP6/333 M-1c package also included the game in its software package.  Production  The aim of this educational video game is to teach players about the \\"culture, ecology, and history of the Amazon River\\". The game was donated to The Strong National Museum of Play. The bulk of new content to the Amazon Trail series is not added in this game, but rather to its own sequel, Amazon Trail 3rd Edition: Rainforest Adventures. Richard D. Thompson was the game's video director.  Plot  The game starts with a mysterious incident at the Museum of Ancient Art, which results in the player ending up in the Amazon. Players are then sent to find a local cure to a disease, with the end goal being to reach the city of Vilcabamba.  Gameplay  Featuring \\"the same gameplay and educational styling\\" as The Oregon Trail, players take a virtual trip up the South American Amazon River in a canoe in an interactive learning journey. The game has 3 levels of difficulty. Players receive points by remaining healthy, using their resources wisely, and conversing with characters correctly. The best players have their names put into a high score list. A fishing meter shows how hard the harpoon is thrown when fishing. Tour guides ask the player questions which they must respond to further the game. The game includes four river guides, 17 assignments, and 50 characters.  Critical reception  Janice Reutter wrote in the Science and Children journal that the game is \\"an exciting, adventurous journey\\" with \\"attractive graphics\\", \\"mysterious and intriguing sound effects\\", and \\"beautiful 3D...scenes\\". The Boston Herald favourably compared it to its \\"pretty simple\\" and \\"not very attractive\\" predecessor Amazon Trail, deeming it a \\"good buy for families who don't yet have Amazon Trail\\". Computer Shopper said a software package that included the game was a \\"great starting point for the first-time buyer\\". The Washington Posts review included testimony from their \\"kid software tester\\" Sarah Phillips, who said that parts of the game could be \\"pretty neat\\" or \\"extremely frustrating\\". MECC deemed it \\"one of the most compelling interactive adventures ever\\". TESL-EJ described it as \\"wonderful\\" and \\"imaginative\\".

Martin Sloop (March 9, 1873 - January 13, 1962) was instrumental to the improvement of healthcare and education in the mountains of North Carolina. She is most notable for founding, expanding, and developing the Crossnore School, serving as director until 1959. In 1953, Sloop published Miracle in the Hills, her autobiography detailing her lifelong efforts in medicine and education reform.  Early life  Sloop was born in Davidson, North Carolina on March 9, 1873. She pursued her college education from both Statesville Female College and Davidson College. Although she sought to pursue a medical degree from North Carolina Medical Institute in Davidson, her gender barred her from studying anatomy there. She ended up receiving her degree from the Women‚Äôs Medical College of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1906. Sloop had aspirations to complete missionary work outside of the United States, but served as a medical missionary in the mountains of North Carolina instead.  Career  After graduating from the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia, Sloop took an internship at the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston in hopes of gaining medical experience. Later, she became a resident physician at Agnes Scott College in Atlanta. Sloop founded the Crossnore School in 1913 with her husband, Dr. Eustace H. Sloop. At the time it was only a town church used four months out of the year. The teachers had little to no education or experience, and students did not attend regularly. Sloop was determined to provide the children in the mountains with a higher education. She started an organization that sold used clothes to fund the school. Over the next 40 years, Sloop would build the one-room schoolhouse into a complex of twenty buildings and over 250 acres, providing a nine-month, eleven-grade education. In 1924, the Daughters of the American Revolution pledged their support to the school, and four years later a hospital was added to the school. By 1939, the Crossnore School was taking in both orphaned and abandoned children. Sloop even changed state law, raising the required attendance age to 16. Another major success of the Crossnore School was its weaving program, founded in 1920. The weaving program allowed women to weave rugs, coverlets, and other handicrafts that were either sold by the school or used in the women‚Äôs homes. Because of the success and growth of the program, Crossnore built a Weaving Room specifically for the crafts program, which was funded by clothes Sloop sold, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and other educational associations and acts. By the fall of 1924, the school‚Äôs statistics determined that 38 students wove at school looms and 11 women wove at looms in their households. The program had an overall positive impact on both the community and on middle-class women, raising the morale of these women and bettering the moral status of the community.  Accomplishments  Published in 1953 by McGraw-Hill Publishers, Miracle in the Hills is the autobiography and personal memoir of Sloop. It was written in conjunction with Legette Blythe and recounts the forty years Sloop and her husband spent fighting for the betterment of the mountain children in Crossnore, North Carolina.  Later life and death  In her later life, Sloop entrusted the care over the Crossnore School with her son, daughter, and son-in-law. Sloop served as director of the Crossnore School until 1959, and died soon after in 1962 at the age of ninety.  Awards  In 1951, Sloop was named America‚Äôs Mother of the Year. US Highway 221 in North Carolina is named after her in honor of her efforts, the Dr. Mary Martin Sloop Highway.

Overview BTC was found in Qatar in 1997 to offer retail complexes in the region, giving a space for shopping, dining, and entertainment. It has progressed over the years in developing premium malls, entertainment, real estate, and high end brands. The chairman and managing director of BTC is Abdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Rabban. Projects The Landmark Shopping Mall, built in 2000, and the Villaggio Shopping Mall, built in 2006, are the company's two most prominent retail complexes, that have had an impact on Qatar's development. The Landmark Shopping Mall is recognized for its innovation in the region in combining shopping and leisure, while the Villaggio Shopping Mall was focused on bringing luxury brands to the region. The company also plays a large role in the development of real estate projects in Qatar, focusing its efforts on residential, commercial, and luxury hotel projects. BTC has aimed to expand its efforts beyond Qatar, and develop its projects in other countries in the GCC. BTC boasts itself on its connections in the State of Qatar and in the Gulf region. It has partnered with JW Marriot to develop hotels in both Doha and Bahrain, and has joint ventures with Azadea Group, Remza-BTC, Rash Fashion, Jawad, and Cineco on its retail projects. BTC has established itself as a successful player in Qatar and the Gulf States with a reputation as a multi-million riyal holding and investment company. Controversies With BTC being one of the two shareholders of Villagio Mall, Al Rabban was implicated in the 2012 Villaggio Mall Fire incident. This mall fire occurred on a BTC property, Villaggio Mall, and killed 19 people, 13 of whom were toddlers. The fire caused the most damage in Gympanzee daycare center. In the investigation, the daycare center was said to have not acquired the obligatory licensing as a nursery by the ministry of social affairs. Due to this, the daycare did not meet the required safety conditions. The investigation blamed the May 2012 fire and its damages on \\"lack of adherence to laws, systems and measures by all concerned parties to different degrees.\\" The owners involved were charged in Qatar, and the prosecution argued that the defendants did not comply with the necessary health and safety requirements, and that it was not licensed to operate. In 2013, Al Rabban was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter due to negligence, and was sentenced to six years in prison. During the 5 hour closing statement of the case, Al Rabban's defense attorney stated that his client did not own any shares in the mall, despite his clear ownership ties to the property. Additionally, during the appeals hearing, the defense lawyers questioned why no one from the U.S. sports firm, Nike, had been charged, considering the fire started in their store at the mall. Al Rabban was later cleared of his charges, and the court deferred his sentence his firm, the Qatari Company for Real Estate and Commercial Projects. In Al Rabban's retrial in April 2016, he failed to appear in court, and had his lawyer notify the court that he could not attend because he was traveling. Additionally, Al Rabban is married to the niece of Sheikh Thani bin Abdullah al-Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling family, the chairman and managing director of Ezdan Real Estate, the head of Tadawul Holding Group's board, and the founder of Qatari charity RAF. Al-Thani's real estate firm, worth $16 billion, is the largest in the MENA region based on its market capitalization, and his holding company has a capital of over $7.5 billion. He is also a large contributor and leader for prominent Islamic banks in Qatar, including the International Islamic Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank, and Masraf Al Rayan. Al Thani's charity, a semi- official Qatari government charity has been associated with terrorist organizations and terror financing. In one instance, Shafi Al Ajmi, a designated Al Nusra terrorist financier who boasted of receiving funds to prepare mujahedeen in Syria, asked donors to send money to RAF charity.

Mary Reynolds Babcock was the daughter of R.J Reynolds and Katharine Smith Reynolds and therefore inherited considerable wealth from her father's foundation of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. She was a founder for both Zachary Smith Reynolds Foundation and Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. She and her husband Charles Babcock gifted Wake Forest University 350 acres, and the university moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Early life Mary Reynolds Babcock was one of four children: one sister, Nancy Reynolds, and two brothers, R. J. Reynolds Jr., and Zachary Smith Reynolds. Mary was the second child born to R.J and Katharine Reynolds, as well as their first daughter. Mary's father died when she was only ten, and her mother passed away when she was sixteen. As a child, Mary Reynolds Babcock went to a small private school in Reynolda and eventually went on to Salem Academy to further her education. This schooling was later followed by schooling at Miss Wright's School in Pennsylvania. After she graduated from high school she went to Paris and studied art, a passion of hers. In 1936, her father, R.J. Reynolds, left her an inheritance of thirty million dollars. At this point in her life, she was considered to be one of the wealthiest women in the world. With this money, she made many donations to various causes with a focus on local education. Mary Reynolds Babcock and her husband Charles Babcock Marriage Mary Reynolds Babcock married Charles Henry Babcock, an investment banker from Philadelphia, and had four children. Charles Babcock was an influential businessman and a public-minded citizen whose influence continues to be felt throughout the state of North Carolina and especially the Piedmont in the twenty-first century. Death Babcock died of cancer in 1953. Her will provided twelve million dollars for a trust established as the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. She died in New York City and was buried in Winston-Salem. Foundation Mary Reynolds Babcock started the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation, which was established in 1953 after the death of her brother, Zachary Smith Reynolds. It had a broad mandate to support the 'betterment of mankind and furtherance of the public welfare'. She later started the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. The Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation's mission is to \\"help people and places to move out of poverty and achieve greater social and economic justice.\\" By the 1960s, both foundations were controlled by interlocking boards composed primarily of Reynolds family members, including Charles (Charlie) H. Babcock, Mary Reynolds's husband; R.J. Reynolds Jr.; and Anne Reynolds Forsyth, Zachary Smith Reynold's daughter from his first marriage. By the 1960s, the Reynolds' wealth had passed into the hands of a second generation of family members who were far removed from the political and economic struggles of the workplace. They played no role in the day-to-day management of Reynolds Tobacco. They took their cues instead from the culture of mid-twentieth-century American philanthropy, which puts its faith in social engineering and the use of private wealth to advance the common welfare. Some examples include Alliance for Appalachia, Blueprint NC, and Federation of Child Care Centers of Alabama. Wake Forest land grant Charles and Mary Reynolds Babcock donated 350 acres from the family estate for the relocation of Wake Forest University. From 1952 to 1956, 14 buildings were constructed on the Winston-Salem campus. The school was officially moved to Winston-Salem in the summer of 1956.

Wallace, 78, Is Dead; Pioneer Leader at Cessna Aircraft,\\", December 23, 1989, The New York Times at NYTimes.com One account describes Wallace as having made up his mind at age 10 to make his life in aviation. In his early adulthood, Dwayne entered the aeronautical engineering program at the Municipal University of Wichita, in Wichita, Kansas (one of the nation's first three such programs), and graduated in May/June 1933 (historian Ed Phillips says June 1932), the first (of many) to graduate that university with a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering. While at Wichita U., Wallace learned to fly from his uncle's test pilot, George Harte. He soloed in the Cessna CG-2 after only an hour and 45 minutes training, and advised changes to the glider that resulted in the Cessna CG-3. He first soloed in Travel Air biplane in March 1932, earning his private pilot's license in 1933. (Later he would advance to a commercial pilot license, with multi-engine and instrument-flight ratings.) Early career Upon his graduation, in May 1933, Wallace entered the workforce during the depths of the Great Depression. His uncle Clyde Cessna's enterprise had been taken over by its investors, and had closed its doors‚Äîejecting Clyde and his son, Eldon Cessna.Bissionette, Bruce, The Wichita 4: Cessna, Moellendick, Beech & Stearman, 1999, Aviation Heritage, Destin, FL. (from interviews with Matty Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Olive Ann Beech, Dwane Wallace, Herb Rawdon, Walter Burnham, and other principals). However, Wallace was able to find work assisting one of his uncle's former business partners, aviation pioneer Walter Beech, at the newly formed Beech Aircraft Corporation in Wichita‚Äîwhich, ironically, was operating from rented space in the closed Cessna factory. Wallace assisted the development of the Beech Model 17 \\"Staggerwing\\" biplane, one of the more advanced aircraft of its time. Takeover of Cessna Aircraft Co. In 1934, following Beech's relocation out of the Cessna factory, Dwane, with lawyer-brother Dwight, approached their uncle Clyde with the idea of a proxy fight to try and regain control of Cessna Aircraft, reopen the factory, and resume aircraft development and production. Traveling the country to meet and persuade investors, and committing to them that the three family leaders would work with little or no pay, the Wallace brothers won the proxy fight. At a stockholders' meeting on January 10, 1934, they seized control of the company‚Äîwith Clyde serving as figurehead president, while the Wallace brothers (Dwane as plant manager and engineer, Dwight as secretary/treasurer) ran the company. Clyde's son, Eldon (also an aeronautical engineer), remained at the company until a disagreement with Wallace over salary led to his departure in the Summer of 1935. In December 1935, tired of aviation and longing for his old farm, Clyde sold his stock in the company to the Wallace brothers, though remained the figurehead president. Within about a year, in October 1936, shortly before Wallace's 25th birthday, Clyde resigned, leaving Wallace fully in charge. Cessna career For the next four decades, Dwane Wallace would lead Cessna, transforming it from a small-but-noted maker of light planes into the world's foremost producer of such aircraft, and a major source of many other types of civilian and military aircraft, including jets. Throughout his career, Wallace was described as totally focused on the company. According to successor Russ Meyer, Wallace did not play golf or tennis, and had \\"absolutely no avocation [except] Cessna.\\" Despite his achievements, and the scope of his wealth, power and influence, Wallace had a reputation for shyness and humility, and was known to humbly mingle and dine with factory workers. In his early years as company president, he also test- flew, raced and sold planes, painted them, pitched for the lunchtime softball team, fetched water for factory workers, and swept floors. Shyness notwithstanding, according to his long-time second-in-command, Del Roskam, Wallace was a \\"hands-on\\" manager, \\"a good people-person,\\" who would tour the factory, meeting foremen and workers, and talking through problems with them personally. =The Great Depression years= Starting in 1933, Wallace aided Clyde and Eldon Cessna in developing their CR-3 aircraft, a much-improved variant on the Cessna Model A series, and also produced older Cessna DC-6A cabin monoplanes. In 1934, Wallace, with help from Eldon and others, designed the Cessna C-34 (for \\"Cessna ‚Äì 1934\\"), an exceptionally low-drag airplane, offering 162-mph speed with a 145-horsepower engine, and delivered the first one to a customer in 1935. The plane (and its variants), introduced wing flaps to Cessna, allowing a lower-drag wing, and easier landing in small areas. The plane won numerous races and competitions. When Wallace won a major national efficiency-and-performance competition‚Äîthe Detroit News Trophy at the All American Air Races‚Äîfor the third year, in a C-34 variant, the Cessna Aircraft design was awarded the trophy permanently, and given the title \\"World's Most Efficient Airplane.\\" The notoriety boosted sales, and in 1936, the company sold 33 of the planes. > NOTE: Some controversy exists among historical accounts of the development > of the C-34. Eldon Cessna, and historians acquainted with him, have credited > its design to Eldon. However, most historical accounts (mostly produced by > Cessna personnel or authors aided by the company while under the control of > Dwane Wallace), credit the design to Wallace ‚Äì some saying it originated in > Wallace's mind while still in college, though Eldon Cessna is commonly > credited with having been a contributing engineer, along with engineers Tom > Salter and Gerry Gerteis. In addition to advancing the Cessna airplanes' reputation, and sales, exhibition flying at county fairs and major events, and trophy racing, also brought prize money, which helped keep the company solvent‚Äîmaking exhibition flying and racing necessary duties of Wallace's early Cessna career. The early years, during the Great Depression‚Äîwhile taking no salary‚Äîwere reportedly extremely difficult for the company and Wallace, and photos of him at the time show an extremely gaunt man. One enduring legend says that at one point he only had five dollars in the company bank account. Wallace added aircraft maintenance services to the company's business activity by February 1935. In 1937, Wallace hired an executive secretary, Velma Lunt, in 1937, and married her in 1941. She became a licensed pilot, certified to fly multi-engine aircraft, and worked closely with Wallace for many years. The two remained married until Wallace's death. (Eventually the couple had four daughters: Linda, Karen, Diana and Sarah*) (* the New York Times obituary says \\"Farah\\") In 1938, Wallace's review of twin-engined airplane market indicated opportunity for a new, inexpensive, light twin, and he began development of the Cessna T-50 Bobcat, which introduced twin engines and retractable landing gear to Cessna production aircraft. Though not formally trained in twin-engine aircraft, and not licensed for their operation, he taught himself to fly the Bobcat in 1939, as its test pilot. Gambling on a good market for the civilian plane, and potential military market for it upon the eruption of World War II in Europe, Wallace invested heavily in a new factory in May 1940. The gamble paid off. =World War II= Under Wallace, the Cessna Aircraft Company survived until the early years of World War II, before American involvement, when Wallace was able to secure contracts with the U.S. and Canadian government to build training plane variants of the Bobcat for the Royal Canadian Air Force (which was already aiding Great Britain in the war), and, as the Cessna AT-8 advanced trainer, it was acquired by the thousands by the U.S. Army Air Corps, to train most U.S. transport and bomber pilots for the war, and for use as a light transport. By war's end, over 5,000 had been delivered, making Cessna, undeniably, one of the nation's major plane-makers, though only with small planes. Additional wartime contracts‚Äîmaking parts of other manufacturers' military planes, and assembling Waco CG-4A combat transport gliders‚Äîhelped Wallace's company grow. The government funding supporting Cessna's manufacture of sections of advanced all-metal aircraft, such as engine cowls for the Douglas A-26 and tails for the Boeing B-29, enabled Cessna to leap ahead of other pre-war light plane makers (most of whom were largely relegated to producing their original frame-and-fabric aircraft, or similar planes, soon made obsolete by the technological leaps of the Second World War). During the war, Cessna became the first of Wichita's planemakers to win the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award, an award for excellence given to only 3% of U.S. defense contractors. Cessna would win it a total of five times. =Postwar years= Cessna re-entered the civilian plane market after World War II with a key advantage over most of its light-plane rivals: Cessna had the know-how and means to build all-metal light planes‚Äîan advantage accruing to Cessna from the company's rights to key metal-plane manufacturing technologies pioneered and patented by former Cessna Vice President Albin K. Longren, and Cessna's government-funded, wartime subcontracting work with large metal airplane sections. After the war, Wallace quickly developed an all-metal replacement of the C-34‚Äîthe Cessna 190 / Cessna 195, a speedy 6-seat, single-engine, executive aircraft, powered by a large, traditional radial engine. Wallace then guided Cessna away from the pioneering un-braced cantilever-wing design concepts of Clyde Cessna, towards more conservative- and-traditional, strut-braced, high wings‚Äîproducing the world's most successful line of single-engine light aircraft, ranging through numerous variants from the Cessna 120/Cessna 140 to the Cessna 207‚Äîdespite the industry's move towards cantilever wings. The 120/140 also was the beginning of Cessna's conversion to smaller-cabin aircraft with streamlined, flat, horizontal-cylinder engines. The 120/140's distinguishing feature, compared to other two-seaters of the time, was that it was one of the first all-metal light planes. Sleek, sturdy and modern, and cheaply mass-produced, the 120/140 largely devoured the market for two-seat light airplanes. In December 1946, Cessna produced almost as many planes as all its competitors combined. Most other U.S. light plane makers, by the early 1950s, were driven out of business by the 120/140 design, and by a long, postwar market recession. Cessna survived and prospered‚Äîstretching the 120/140 into the 4-seat Cessna 170 (which conquered its market segment, as well). When the postwar recession of the late 1940s and early 1950s wiped out most general aviation planemakers, Wallace diversified and survived adding an industrial division producing furniture and hydraulic equipment at a factory in Hutchinson, Kansas, He expanded the company's dealer network globally, and added a customer-finance division to the company, boosting sales substantially. Wallace, however, was slow to embrace the industry's shift towards nosewheel-equipped aircraft, replacing tailwheel-equipped planes. Allowing rival Piper to recapture much of the light plane market with its Tri-Pacer for several years. Eventually, Wallace responded with a nosewheel-equipped variant of the 170, the Cessna 172, which would eventually become the world's most popular light airplane (still in production as of 2016). By 1958, Cessna was producing more light aircraft than all four of its main competitors combined, eventually controlling over half the market. Starting in the late-1950s, Wallace added light twins to the Cessna line, and began the diversification of the Cessna line into almost every conceivable type and market. Wallace sought military subcontracting work, resulting in Cessna building major sections of various U.S. jet trainers, fighters and bombers‚Äîincluding the Lockheed T-33, Lockheed F-94, Republic F-84, Boeing B-47 and Boeing B-52. That work complimented Cessna's development of the Cessna T-37, selected by the U. S. Air Force as its basic jet trainer for several decades. In the late-1950s and early-1960s, Wallace decided to diversify Cessna, acquiring avionics-producer Aircraft Radio Corporation and propeller-maker McCauley Industrial Corporation. He expanded Cessna's Fluid Power Division (producing hydraulic cylinders for a wide range of industrial uses) in Hutchinson, Kansas, and opened Cessna parts or aircraft factories in Glenrothes, Scotland, Reims, France, and later in Mendoza, Argentina‚Äîalong with marketing and servicing centers at other places around the world. In 1964, to honor Cessna's international trade development, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, at a White House ceremony, presented Wallace with the Presidential \\"E\\" for Export Award. Along the way, under Wallace's guidance, Cessna produced \\"an airplane for every need\\"‚Äîalmost every conceivable type of light-to-medium, single-engine and multi-engine aircraft‚Äîincluding: gliders, bush planes, small military transports, floatplanes, aerobatic stunt planes, helicopters, executive aircraft, cropdusters, small airliners, military spotter and liaison aircraft, military trainers (propeller and jet), attack jets, and business jets‚Äîover 40 models in all. Not all of Wallace's ventures were successful‚Äîmost notably the four- engined Cessna 620 airliner, and the Cessna Skyhook helicopter line. Both were scrapped before any significant production. Ditto the four-seat, civilian version of the otherwise-successful Cessna T-37 military jet trainer. But many Cessna aircraft types, developed under Wallace, became the world's most popular of their kind, including the world's most popular line of floatplanes, the world's most popular training airplane (Cessna 150), the world's most popular light plane (Cessna 172/Skyhawk), the world most popular \\"high- performance\\" light plane (Cessna 182/Skylane), world's most popular bush plane (Cessna 185 / Skywagon 185), world's most popular cropdusters (Cessna 188/AgWagon). Wallace was President of Cessna Aircraft from 1935 to 1964, then advanced to chairman of the board. The company that Wallace had revived from the brink of bankruptcy, in 1935, had become, by 1972, the first company in world history to manufacture over 100,000 airplanes. In 1972, Wallace led the industry movement to establish a trade organization for general aviation aircraft manufacturers‚Äîseparate from the industry trade organizations for manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft. The new organization, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, selected founder Wallace as its first chairperson. Perhaps Wallace's most daring late-career venture was the first Cessna business jet, the Cessna FanJet 500, soon renamed Cessna Citation. Despite widespread criticism‚Äîeven mockery of the unusually slow business jet‚ÄîWallace held firm to the belief that it would be successful. Early sales paled against cross-town rival Lear Jet, whose Model 23 was (like most contemporary business jets) 150 mph faster, carrying more passengers, farther‚Äîthough also more expensive, more difficult to fly, and requiring longer runways. Wallace persisted, and the Citation line soon evolved into the world's most popular line of business jets, utterly eclipsing all rivals. By the end of his tenure in office, Wallace's Cessna Aircraft Co. had out- produced every other civilian airplane maker in world history, with over 170,000 aircraft produced‚Äîranging from fabric-skinned, taildraggers and two- seat training planes, to combat aircraft and business jets. =Retirement= In 1974, Wallace recruited aviation industry executive Russell W. Meyer Jr. from his role as president and CEO of rival Grumman American Aircraft Corp., and groomed Meyer to replace himself. Wallace then retired, in 1975, from the role of Cessna's chairman of the board‚Äîhanding over the company to Meyer, and stepping down to become a regular member of the board of directors.\\"Meyer\\" in \\"Men of the Future,\\" Flying Magazine, 50th anniversary special edition, Sept. 1977, p.369 Wallace quickly disappeared from the public eye, except for philanthropic activity (particularly in Wichita and for his alma mater, Wichita State University) with his wife Velma Wallace. But Wallace remained a consultant and director of the company well into the early 1980s, when he helped shape one of the company's most important aircraft, the Cessna 208 Caravan. His obituary in the New York Times reports that Wallace \\"severed his ties\\" with Cessna in 1983, following a dispute with his hand-picked successor, Meyer. Dwane Wallace died at age 78, after a lengthy illness, on December 21, 1989. Wallace had been a member of the Aviation Pioneers Hall of Fame, the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and the Quiet Birdmen.

However, in the 1960s, the Wallace name was attached to the company's new factory building, at the municipal airport on Wichita's southwest side. Additionally, in 1979, the new main building of the College of Engineering at Wichita State University‚Äîhis alma mater, which he had richly endowed‚Äîwas named Wallace Hall for him.

His birth and death dates are unknown. Based on dated and annotated drawings by his hand it has been concluded that he worked in Brussels between 1652 and 1665. As there is no record of the artist in the archives of the guilds of St. Luke of Brussels and Antwerp, it is assumed that he was an amateur artist.Charles Dumas, ‚ÄúAnthonie Crussens at Lawrence Steigrad Fine Arts A seated musketeer saluting a cavalier on a track The artist was possibly the father of Jasper Crussens, who produced drawings for the Affligem Abbey in West Brabant around 1699. Work Anthonie Crussens is mainly known for his drawings. Only one painting and one print by him are known while some 40 drawings by his hand have survived. About three quarters of his drawings are landscapes, often set in winter and mainly depicting hilly areas at the edge of a wood. The landscapes are always populated with a few figures such as hunters, horsemen, soldiers, peasants, fishermen or beggars. Some drawings include a castle or monastery in the vicinity of Brussels. An example is the Hunters resting on the board of a river in front of Tervuren Castle near Brussels (At Christie's 16 October 2013, Paris, lot 167).Anhonie Crussens, Hunters resting on the board of a river in front of Tervuren Castle near Brussels at Christie's Seated old man holding a pipe The remaining quarter of his drawings consist mainly of genre scenes: soldiers in action or satirical peasant figures engaging in activities such as singing, reading and smoking. It is believed that each of the figures represent one of the five senses. Examples are the three drawings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which symbolize Hearing, Smell and Sight. He often signed his drawings, which are almost all on vellum with framing lines and wide margins, which suggests that he intended them for sale.Anthonie Crussens, Landscape with horseman and two soldiers at Waddesdon Manor Nearly all of them have modest dimensions and are drawn in pen in brown ink, sometimes over traces of a sketch in black chalk. His drawing style, with sharp contours and many cross-hatchings, is very characteristic and easily recognizable. This style, which appears to imitate engravings, is reminiscent of late 16th-century drawings and was already old-fashioned in the middle of the 17th century. His Portrait of a Gentleman (At Lawrence Steigrad Fine Arts) is the only known portrait by his hand. It resembles more a tronie or genre figure, but unlike his other genre portraits, the person depicted is not a peasant but an elegantly dressed gentleman. His bearing and the figures in the background, including hunters and a horseman, seem to indicate a person of distinction. The man has his right hand in a sling. It is not known whether this depiction of a man with a broken arm had a specific, possibly satirical, meaning in 17th-century Flanders.

Rochester General Hospital has been serving the residents of the Rochester Region and beyond since 1847. Rochester General Hospital offers primary medical care and a broad range of specialties. Rochester General Hospital‚Äôs medical staff includes over 1,000 primary care physicians and specialists, many of whom have offices at the hospital and throughout the community. History Chartered in 1847 and established in 1864, the Rochester City Hospital opened during the last years of the American Civil War. Along with St. Mary‚Äôs hospital that was designated as a U.S. Army General Hospital, the City Hospital‚Äôs first major challenge was the treatment of 448 Union soldiers in the next two years. In the post-war years, the Hospital rapidly grew, embracing the advancement of medical technology, and becoming a leader in surgery and nursing. The Rochester City Hospital School of Nursing was established in 1880 and became the 12th nursing training program in the nation and the 3rd in New York State. Many graduates from the school would later have distinguished careers in nursing and as administrators and physicians. Rochester City Hospital in 1864. To reflect its all-encompassing mission, the hospital‚Äôs name changed to Rochester General Hospital in 1911. In the early years of the twentieth-century members of the medical staff responded to the Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918-1919 and became the nucleus of the organized military hospitals, Base Hospital 19 in the First World War and the 19th General Hospital later on in Second World War. The post Second World War years reflected a period of rapid growth and technological advancement. The hospital led the region by opening the first Premature Infant Nursery in Western New York in 1951. The absence of a hospital in the northern sections of the city prompted the establishment in 1956 of the new Rochester General Hospital Northside campus on Portland Avenue. While maintaining both the new ‚ÄúNorthside‚Äù campus and the original, now designated ‚ÄúWestside‚Äù campus, the hospital continued to embrace the leading advancements in medical technology. The Westside campus closed in 1966 leaving Northside as the Rochester General Hospital. The forerunner to the present Rochester Heart Institute, the Cardio- Pulmonary Laboratory opened in 1959 and installed the first pacemaker in 1963 closely followed by the first open-heart surgery the following year. Through the 1970s and 1980s the hospital continued to expand to serve the needs of the community. In response to evolving health care industry in 1984, Rochester General Hospital, along with its affiliates, combined with the Genesee Hospital, Newark-Wayne Community Hospital, and the Continuing Care Network to form the Greater Rochester Health system (GRHS.) In 1997 the Rochester General Hospital celebrated its 150th anniversary. This year also saw the system change its name to ViaHealth, which comprised the Rochester General Hospital, The Genesee Hospital, Newark-Wayne Community Hospital, The Behavioral Health Network and the Continuing Care network of long-term care providers. The organization again changed its branding name from Viahealth to the Rochester General Health System in 2008 to closer reflect its long history of commitment and service to the Rochester community.

In 2010, RGH cared for more than 100,000 patients in the emergency department, discharged over 32,356 inpatients, and performed more than 15,300 surgical procedures and over 1,159,000 outpatient encounters. =Sands- Constellation Center for Critical Care= Rochester General Hospital is currently constructing a 7 story, 312,000 square foot critical-care building, that will include 23 operating rooms, 128 private-acuity-adaptable patient rooms, and 14 special care nursery rooms. Rochester General received its largest gift in the hospital's history from Robert Sands of Constellation Brands. Upon approval from the State of New York, the facility is projected to be completed in late 2021. Hospital rating data The HealthGrades website contains the clinical quality data for the Rochester General Hospital, as of 2017.

A largely swampy terrain, it is the site of one of the last battles of King Philip's War to be fought in southern New England, on July 2, 1676. The battle is of interest to military historians because it included a rare use in the war of a cavalry charge by the English colonists. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Setting The battle took place in a swampy area of North Smithfield, with a hill to its west and a few small rises of solid land within the swamp. The swamp was, at the time of the battle, described by chroniclers as \\"a great spruce swamp\\". History By the summer of 1676, English colonists had gained the upper hand in King Philip's War, and the opposing American Indian tribes were generally in retreat. Many Narragansetts, based on southern Rhode Island, had fled to the Connecticut River valley after the Great Swamp Fight, a devastating assault on their central village by a combined English and Indian force in December 1675. In the summer of 1676, a band of approximately 100 Narragansetts led by female sachem Quaiapen returned to northern Rhode Island, apparently seeking to recover cached seed corn for planting. They were attacked by a force of 400, composed of 300 Connecticut colonial militia and about 100 Mohegan and Pequot warriors. The attacking forces had scouted the Narragansett position at the western edge of the swamp, and organized an attack over and around the hill to the west. A portion of the Connecticut militia were mounted dragoons, and the battle is believed to be one of the few in the war in which such forces actually saw mounted combat. The Narragansetts were driven into the swamp where many were killed, including Quaiapen. Her death spelled the end of organized Narragansett opposition in the conflict. Archaeology Due to the poor quality of the terrain, the battlefield area has escaped significant development, with only modest agricultural uses around its edges, and some residential development in the same areas. Archaeological investigation of the site (which is nearly landlocked by surrounding landowners) has yielded Narragansett domestic objects as well as lead shot, musket balls, and other military artifacts.

The ball was snapped to Chilson who threw a touchdown pass to Bohn to tie the score. Earl Loser scored Colorado's second touchdown, and Quinlan kicked a field goal to give Colorado its final tally of 17 points. Hartshorn also returned a kick 60 yards but was caught from behind. G. E.

She has been described as a feminist eugenicist.  Career  She and Francis Galton founded the Eugenics Education Society (now known as the Galton Institute) in London in 1907, with Galton serving as its first honorary president. She took the role of honorary secretary upon the Society's founding until 1920. The Eugenics Education Society believed that social class and poverty were directly linked to one's genetics and their ideals were closely linked to the Committee of the Moral Education League (1898). She also founded the Imperial Society for Promoting Sex Education and was the Deputy Chair of the Child Welfare Council. Therefore, the Society aimed to reduce poverty in England through reducing the birth rate of the lowest classes and those of low intelligence. In 1912, she was the driving force behind the Society's organisation of the first International Eugenics Congress in South Kensington. After 1920 she acted as the Society Council's vice-president and later was elected to serve on the consultative council, a position that she held until her death in 1955. Neville-Rolfe implemented the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913. She was also one of the establishing members of the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child (now known as Gingerbread) in 1918, where she worked on reforming poor-law institutions and hostels for unmarried mothers and their children. She was also a leading figure in the National Council for Combating Venereal Disease (NCCVD) which was founded in 1914. Upon the NCCVD's founding she held the position of Honorary Secretary. Later in the NCCVD's life she held the position of secretary-general. The NCCVD changed its name to the British Social Hygiene Council in 1926, and Neville-Rolfe remained working for them until her retirement in 1944.  Awards  She was awarded an OBE for her work during the First World War with the War Savings Committee in the Treasury. In 1941, she became both the first woman and the first non-American to receive the Snow Medal from the American Social Hygiene Association, for distinguished services to humanity.  Beliefs  Her beliefs in eugenics and prostitution developed when she trained and worked as a rescue worker in a shelter for troubled girls. She was determined to study these issues in efforts to eliminate prostitution and venereal disease. She stopped working at the shelter because she felt the staff were not well educated on physiology and reproduction. She then left to find work elsewhere in Bethnal Green, London, where even there, she thought this staff of rescue workers was not competent or knowledgeable about contraception. Because of this, she insisted they educate themselves further in the area of biological sciences. She also believe single mothers were not to blame as they had been manipulated and enticed by men. Because of this, she was determined to help educate these women on sex and contraception in order to prevent these mistakes from happening in the future. = Eugenics = Sybil Neville-Rolfe published an article in 1917 titled \\"The Eugenic Principle in Social Reconstruction\\" which detailed her beliefs regarding eugenics. She believed that certain people were genetically superior to other people within a society, and that these people who were genetically superior to their peers and born into the lower classes would rise up to attain a higher quality of life. They would do so because they were inherently more productive and useful people within society, which would be proven by the fact that they were able to achieve financial independence. Conversely, she felt that children born into families of people who had proven themselves to be of a higher genetic status than their peers could also be of a lower genetic worth than their parents and would naturally sink in status through the course of their life, and also never achieve the financial independence that is used in this system to prove one's genetic worth. She called this process eugenic selection. Throughout her life she made several assertions as to how eugenics could be implemented into the governing bodies and institutions in Britain to preserve the Anglo-Saxon race. She felt that changes needed to be made at both a social and government level to encourage people with better genetics to marry and have children together early in life while also discouraging people who could not attain financial independence, contracted a venereal disease, or were otherwise mentally deficient from having children. To this end she suggested several changes to social norms and the policies of the government, including: * Discouraging people who lived in workhouses from having children. * Discouraging homosexual relationships. * Encouraging young people to obtain financial independence early to allow them to marry and have children early in life. * Allowing for easier access to divorce, because if young people were going to marry early there would have to be a system in place that would allow for the rectification of mistakes in their choice of partner. * Changing the policies on illegitimate children to hold fathers accountable, along with the mother, for the care and support of their child even if that child was conceived and born out of wedlock. * Establishing a ministry of health with a strong department focused on eugenics to collect data and learn about the genetic stock of their country and how best to implement eugenic practices. * Encouraging eugenicists to participate in government to aid the implementation and understanding of eugenic practices. * Establishing an economic policy of housing that will address the problems London faced with housing at the time. This suggested policy included the setting of a minimum housing standard that would be met by the government to house people that could not attain the financial independence Neville-Rolfe uses as a standard of genetic superiority. She felt that once minimum standard of housing was established all people would naturally wish to live in a better condition than the minimum. To this end the efficient people of the community who were able to raise their standard of living would have proven that they were genetically superior to the others that could not achieve that goal, and would be encouraged to marry and have children early. * Establishing programs to teach people about the practice of using birth control to allow women and families more control over how many children they had and the timing of their pregnancies. * Requiring that people who want to marry submit a health declaration before being allowed to marry. She felt that upon implementation this measure would only be for informational purposes but eventually it would be possible to use this as a part of the process of the selection of citizens who were, or were not, genetically worthy of being allowed to marry and have children. * Implementing eugenic education in schools. She felt that it was paramount for teachers to learn about eugenic practices and teach their students about the importance of eugenics. * Implementing education about eugenics would eventually lead to a wider understanding of the duty she felt all people who were considered fit to share, and that is the duty to have children under the best possible marriage conditions and pass on their fitness and genetic heritage to the next generation. * Implementing a tax system that taxes citizens without children more than citizens with children. This would be implemented through a policy that focuses more on the total amount of taxes collected from a particular class, and that would allow for people with children to attain breaks in taxes while requiring people without children to pay more taxes to make up the difference, in order for the government to collect the same total amount of tax dollars from that particular class of person. Neville-Rolfe felt that this would encourage people to have children via providing a financial benefit as well as shifting the financial stress of taxes off of parents, who could then have more money to spend on the care of their children. = Prostitution = Throughout her life Sybil Neville-Rolfe took a stance against the practice of prostitution and suggested many ways in which this problem could be dealt with, especially within the article she published in 1918 titled \\"The Changing Moral Standard: Reprinted from The Nineteenth Century and After.\\" Instead of blaming the prostitute for the profession that she ended up in, Neville-Rolfe blames the degeneration of morals and the perpetuation of the profession by three different interest groups associated with the practice; The prostitutes themselves who supply the profession, those that purchase and demand their services, and the middle-men who encourage this practice for their own material gain. Each of these groups have their own distinct subgroups.  Supply  # The feeble-minded, who should have been cared for through provisions within the government that existed in this era to help prevent them from needing to turn to prostitution to support themselves. # The morally defective, who she felt should have been dealt with through amending the Mental Deficiency Act # Women charged and convicted of a crime who had served her sentence but, because of her conviction, finds it impossible to return to her profession or be hired into another respectable profession after serving her sentence. # Unmarried mothers, who were often disowned by their families and fired from their jobs because of their status of unwed motherhood. The social machinations of the era often prevented these women from being able to find respectable work and many unwed mothers were forced to turn to prostitution to pay for the care of themselves and their child. # Normal girls led astray by wanting to have a good time and the relaxation of moral codes that condemn premarital sex.  Demand  # Men who only turn to prostitution one or a few times before marriage, then marry and live a normal life. # Men who seek prostitutes and extra-marital sex after marriage # Men who are considered temperamentally unstable and seek out prostitutes habitually throughout the course of their lives.  Middle-men  # The brothel-keeper, which includes women who owned and ran brothels as well as pimps, who made money through bringing together supply with demand. # The property owner, who could make more money by renting their property to people who intended to use it for amoral and illegal practices. # The liquor and amusement purveyor. Sybil Neville-Rolfe felt that increasingly lax morals of the era were contributing to the problem of prostitution and felt that girls who left the home to take industrial jobs and attain independence were at a particular risk of becoming prostitutes themselves, who would fall under the category of normal girls who were led astray. She felt that without home influences that these girls were liable to fall to the temptation of premarital sex, as there was little provision for recreational activities for women outside of working. This would cause women to go out seeking amusements and, without considering ideas of social responsibility, they would engage in immoral behaviour. To combat this practice she suggested many changes to policy and current legislation, as well as the implementation of new legislation. These ideas included: * Provision of organised recreation for individuals before marriage regardless of gender. * Enforcement of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which was meant to suppress brothels. * Increased licensing requirements and shorter licence intervals for establishments used for amusement. * Provisions for the care and maintenance of unwed mothers throughout pregnancy and the child's infancy. * Provision of education of the dangers of disease and reasons to maintain chastity, including hygienic, social, and ethical reasons. * Establishment of a police force composed of women. * Amending the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913 to include the category \\"Morally Defective.\\" * Making the establishment of paternity of the children of unwed mothers the responsibility of the state, rather than that of the mother. This would then be used to provide for the woman and her child through the court system by forcing the father to pay for his child. * Create committees that women who practice prostitution can be referred to who will provide remand homes for women who are tried for prostitution. These homes would provide care, supervision, and when possible professional training to these women to help prevent them from falling back into prostitution.  Personal life  She was born Sybil Katherine Burney in Queen's House, Royal Naval College on June 22, 1885. She was the daughter of Admiral Sir Cecil Burney and Lucinda Marion Burnett. Her brother was Dennistoun Burney, a marine, aeronautical engineer, and Conservative MP. As a child, she often lodged in different naval quarters, but these moves were always temporary. She was home-schooled by French and English women who were privately hired governesses. She knew multiple languages as she traveled to France and Germany as a teenager, however even this knowledge did not compare to her yearning for a University education. Her first husband was Lieutenant Arthur Corry Gotto, whom she married on December 29, 1905, however this marriage was extremely brief due to his death in a coaling accident in September, 1906. Her second marriage was to Commander Clive Neville-Rolfe on March 24, 1917.  Bibliography  * The Changing Moral Standard.

As a member of the Gardiner‚ÄìHall gang, he participated in the 1862 Escort Rock Gold Robbery, Australia's largest gold heist. The following year, he was fatally shot by a squatter when the gang engaged in a two-hour shootout that became known as the Battle of Goimbla. Early life O'Meally worked as a stockman, looking after cattle and sheep on his father's farm, Arramagong Station in the Lachlan River valley. His father, Paddy O'Meally, also ran a shanty (a very basic hotel), called \\"The Weddin Inn\\", on Emu Creek. The inn was the only hotel in the district. John OMeally, and another one of Gardiner's gang, Alex Fordyce, sometimes worked at the shanty. The gold escort robbery was planned there. Bush ranger with Frank Gardiner On 15 June 1862 the gold escort coach that took the gold from the goldfields of Forbes to Bathurst was robbed. This was one of Australia's biggest robberies. O'Meally and several of his friends were in the gang led by Frank Gardiner. A week after the robbery the police, led by Sir Frederick Pottinger, captured two of the robbers, Henry Manns, and Charlie Gilbert. Charlie Gilbert was the brother of gang member John Gilbert. John Gilbert had nearly been captured but was able to escape. He went straight to \\"The Weddin Inn\\", and together with Ben Hall and O'Meally, captured the police and released the prisoners. Bushranger with Ben Halls gang In July 1863, O'Meally and Gilbert tried to rob the bank at Carcoar in broad daylight. This is believed to be the first daylight bank robbery in Australia. On 30 August 1863, O'Meally tried to rob John Barnes near Wallendbeen station (farm). Barnes owned shops in Cootamundra and Murrumburrah. O'Meally tried to take Barnes' saddle. Barnes rode off to try and get away, but O'Meally shot and killed him. Barnes is buried in the Cootamundra cemetery.

It is the largest of many salt lakes in the eastern end of the Great Victoria Desert. It is normally dry, except during and after periods of heavy rainfall. When it is full, the lake covers an area of around . It is part of the geological basin known as the Officer Basin. The smaller Lake Dey Dey is to the north. Since 1985, Lake Maurice is part of the lands belonging to the Maralinga Tjarutja, a southern branch of the Pitjantjatjara. The community of Oak Valley is near the western shore of the lake. The exposed surface of the lake normally consists of dry clay, silt or sand, covered with a salty crust. The area around Lake Maurice is very dry. Two wells have been drilled to the southeast and northwest of Lake Maurice, to search for uranium and other minerals. Both wells yield very low levels of groundwater. The water contains high levels of salt. It has also been found to contain radium and sediments from the Cambrian era. The elevation of the surface above mean sea level is .Geoscience Australia elevation data portal History The lake is named after the explorer Richard Maurice. Maurice went on at least eight expeditions to the Great Victoria Desert between 1897 and 1903. He was not the first European to pass through this region: Ernest Giles and his team had explored the area almost 20 years before. Giles saw the lake in 1875, but he did not give it a name. He described the area as barren, and wrote that he and his team found no game between Lake Maurice and the Western Australian border. Maurice, in his own expeditions, recorded information and collected specimens on the plants, animals and geology of the area. In 1904, a mining surveyor named Frank George led a prospecting expedition through this region. He used Maurice's camels and equipment and travelled northwest of Lake Dey Dey and across the border to the salt lakes in Western Australia. George named Lake Maurice, and he reported that the area was not likely to contain anything suitable for mining. The area around Lake Maurice was affected by the nuclear- weapon tests done during the 1950s. Dozens of Aboriginal families were removed from their ancestral lands and settled in towns far to the north (Ernabella), south (Yalata and Ooldea) and west (Cundeelee and Warburton). In the late 1940s, a single officer, Walter MacDougall, was sent to warn people in the area of the coming tests. The fallout from the hydrogen bombs was expected to harm or kill anyone within range. Officially, all were forced to leave their lands and were not allowed within 200 km of ground zero. Given that only one officer and an assistant were assigned to warn the people who lived across this huge area, many of the people were never informed, nor did they leave the area. Planes dropped information leaflets across the area, but the natives could not read the leaflets and were wary or afraid of the aircraft.

Early life and education  Wil Lou Gray was born on August 29, 1883 in Laurens, South Carolina. She was the middle child and only daughter of William Lafayette Gray and Sarah Louise Dial. Her father, William Lafayette Gray, was a lawyer, merchant-farmer, and state representative from Laurens County. Her mother, Sarah Louise Dial, was the sister of U.S. Senator Nathaniel B. Dial, The Grays were part of South Carolina's affluent class, devoted Methodists, conservative Democrats, and contributors to the industrial development of their town. At age nine, Gray lost her mother to tuberculosis. She graduated from Laurens High School in 1899. Will Lou Gray continued her education at Columbia College, graduating in 1903. She accepted a teaching position in a one-room, rural schoolhouse in Greenwood County. Teaching opened her eyes to poverty and inspired her to pursue graduate work at Vanderbilt University in 1905 and also Columbia University in 1910. While at Columbia University, Gray developed a progressive educational philosophy while studying under William Archibald Dunning and James Harvey Robinson. In 1911, she received her master's degree in political science.  Career  Gray's career began in 1903 in Greenwood, South Carolina where she taught at the Jones School. The Greenwood community did not see education as a priority, so Gray transferred to a teaching position in English at the Martha Washington College in 1907 and 1908. She then returned to her hometown where she became the principal of the Youngs School. It was here where she observed the issue of adult illiteracy and developed her passion for increasing education among adults. She was elected the supervisor of rural schools in Laurens County and in 1914, opened the first night school for adult education. Gray, who loved to travel, was once inspired during a trip to Switzerland in 1913. It was there where she saw a teacher on an education field trip with more than 100 boys. This influenced her belief in the importance of field trips for both students and teachers. She would later travel with her students and colleagues to different cities in South Carolina, such as Columbia and Charleston, and even to places like New York and Washington, D.C. In 1921, Gray founded the Wil Lou Gray Opportunity School, which is still the state of South Carolina's leader in providing alternative education. This organization's mission statement certifies that, \\"As an agency of state government, the school provides a wealth of academic and life skills training by SC state-certified teachers in modern classroom settings.\\"  Awards  In 1937 she won the Algernon-Sidney Sullivan Award by the University of South Carolina because of her service to mankind. She received a Service to the Black Race award from South Carolina State University. She received honorary doctorates from Columbia College, Clemson University, and Winthrop University. In 1950 the State American Legion granted her a plaque for her Distinguished Public Service. In 1974 she was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame and the Columbia Rotary Club honored her with the Paul Harris Fellowship Award. She was the only female nominee among thirty-four nominations for the South Carolina Man of the Half Century Award.

Early life and education  Annie Wealthy Holland was born in 1871 in Isle of Wight County, Va., next to the plantation her grandmother worked on as a slave. Holland‚Äôs parents, John Daughtry and Margaret Hill named her after Annie Wealthy of the Wealthy plantation, who had set Holland‚Äôs grandfather, Friday Daughtry, free. After finishing her studies at the Isle of Wight County School, Holland's grandfather sent her to Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute so that she could receive a higher education. However, after one year of school, Holland's grandfather's health began to fail, and so he could no longer assist her.  Career  After leaving school, Holland traveled to New York City, New York where she became held the job as a nurse for William Hill. But, after several months, her health began to fail, and she was forced to return home. While at home, she was asked to take charge of a school in her own county, and so she took an exam to receive her second grade certificate. After teaching for two years, Holland traveled back to New York City to complete a course in dressmaking. Holland then went on to teach for nine years, during which she earned her second grade certificate. In 1897, she became assistant principal of a school, and in 1905 became the principal. Following this job, in 1911 Holland became the teaching supervisor in North Carolina, where her job was to make sure that African American students in Gates Country received a well- rounded education. In 1914, she became a supervisor on the Jeanes Fund board, where she served as a consultant and assistant to teachers in the North Carolina area. Later, in 1920, Holland began organizing a negro parent teacher state association, and in 1928 held the first meeting in Raleigh, NC. The organization was meant to raise the standards of home life and bring home to give every child the highest level of spiritual, mental, physical, and moral education.  Death and legacy  Holland passed away on January 6, 1934, at age 63 while addressing a group of teachers in Louisburg, North Carolina, and was later buried in Franklin, North Carolina.

She helped run a prominent tavern in Salisbury, North Carolina that served as a ‚Äúresort‚Äù for many notable figures of the time. Her involvement with the tavern allowed her to support the Revolution by offering hospitality and charity to other supporters of the American cause. TOC Early life and family Steele was born in 1733 to a Scottish family, who had previously immigrated to Pennsylvania Province and later settled in Rowan County, Province of North Carolina. Steele's ancestors, the Maxwells, had a long lineage in Scotland and held numerous titles and awards. The Maxwell family originally earned its high status in Scotland about 600 years ago, when Sir Eustace Maxwell fought with Sir William Wallace in the Wars of Scottish Independence. Steele first married Robert Gillespie, and had two children with him, Robert Jr. and Margaret Gillespie. Not much is known about Robert Gillespie Jr., and all that is known about Margaret Gillespie is that she married Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, who was a Presbyterian preacher and teacher. Robert Gillespie Sr. died in 1760, after being scalped by Cherokee Native Americans during a siege of Fort Dobbs. After Robert Gillespie‚Äôs death, Steele Married her second husband William Steele, who was from Pennsylvania. They had one son together, John Steele. William Steele died before the Revolutionary War, which left Elizabeth Steele to raise three kids and run an ordinary tavern in Salisbury by herself. Steele also became involved in real estate speculation and was able to procure a small estate for herself. John Steele, Elizabeth Steele's only child by her second husband William Steele (a merchant, innkeeper, and local real estate speculator), went on to become appointed comptroller of the U.S. Treasury by President Washington. He also played a major role in defending the militia concept and criticizing a standing army accompanied by excessive executive authority. There is also a book written about him called the Papers of John Steele. Participation in the American Revolutionary War Elizabeth Steele, who was a Whig Patriot, is most renowned for aiding General Nathanael Greene on the morning of February 2, 1781 from her tavern in Salisbury in Rowan County, North Carolina. The encounter occurred at breakfast when a rather weary and disheartened General Nathanael Greene entered the tavern. He had been riding all night and had just learned of the death of General William Davidson at the hands of the British Lieutenant Colonel Banastre of the Tarleton‚Äôs Dragoons. Davidson was killed defending Cowan's Ford on the Catwaba River, near present day Davidson College, that also claimed the lives of 15-50 of his men in the Salisbury District Brigade. This was a blow to the war effort and put Greene in a difficult tactical situation as he had been waiting the entire night for those men to launch a counter attack on the British. It quickly became clear to Steele that Greene was in need of aid. She gave him breakfast to help bolster his spirits. Once Steele learned of his current situation, she went into the backroom of her tavern and, upon her return, drew from under her apron two small bags full of specie, probably the earnings of a number of years. General Greene accepted with thankfulness. The words she imparted with the funds are inscribed in a memorial at Thyratira Presbyterian Church, by the DAR. Quoted: \\"Elizabeth Maxwell Steel 1733-1791 -- Immortal Patriotism, By this gift she being dead yet speaketh. Salisbury - Feb. 1, 1781. To Nathaniel Greene in the darkest hour of his career, she gave 2 bags of gold and silver saying: \\"Take these, General, you need them & I can do without them.\\" This, that this woman hath done, shall always be told as a memorial of her. Oct. 7, 1948. Erected by the E.M.S. Chapter DAR, Salisbury, N.C., descendants & other patriotic citizens.\\" After Greene‚Äôs encounter with Steele, his circumstances improved greatly. While still in Salisbury, he garnered Mrs. Steele‚Äôs aid, and he discovered a collection of more than 1,700 Continental arms that were stashed away for the militia. They were then put to use in resupplying the war against the British. Legacy Steele's helping of Greene proved to be immensely important to improving his spirits and morale, which would soon translate into success on the battlefield in skirmishes in the coming days and months, notably at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in mid March. General Greene's biographer noted of his encounter with Steele: \\"Never, did relief come at a more propitious moment; nor would it be straining conjecture to suppose that he resumed his journey with his spirits cheered and lightened by this touching proof of woman's devotion to the cause of her country.\\"  References   External links  1733 births 1790 deaths People from Rowan County, North Carolina North Carolina in the American Revolution American people of Scottish descent 18th-century American businesspeople 18th-century American businesswomen American restaurateurs Women restaurateurs Drinking establishment owners ","title":"Elizabeth Maxwell Steele"},{"id":"51549093","text":"Khukri Rum is an iconic Nepalese oak vatted dark rum launched in 1959.

He undertook his first university level studies at Bielefeld University, concluding in 1991. During this period he achieved a Master of Arts degree and passed both levels of the national teaching qualification. In 1996 he received his doctorate from Bielefeld for a work (subsequently published as a book ) on Catholicism and Antisemitism in imperial Germany. After that he worked as a research assistant with Lutz Raphael at the University of Trier. Since 2005 Blaschke has been Project Leader in the Society Excellence Dependencies and Social Networks cluster. The project investigates the networks of Catholic churches and Catholicism researchers in the German Federal Republic.

Altman was an employee of the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU). She was also the general secretary of the International Defence and Aid Fund (IDAF).  Biography  Altman was the daughter of Lithuanian immigrants. She attended Jeppe High School for Girls. Altman, like other girls at her high school, sewed \\"for the poor Blacks\\" on Thursdays. Altman attended the University of Witwatersrand on a loan from the Transvaal Education Department that stipulated she teach after graduation. During her time at university, she took part in student demonstrations protesting the \\"Greyshirts and the bulldozing of Sophiatown.\\" She earned an undergraduate degree and then finished an Honours degree in History before spending a year at the Teachers' Training College in Johannesburg. She was almost expelled from the Teachers' Training College because of her activism, but she graduated and spent three years teaching at \\"all White schools.\\" After teaching, she started working for the anti-fascist Springbok Legion. In the Springbok Legion, she helped support ex-servicemen of color, where she was able to see the \\"disastrous effects of the Apartheid system on African men.\\" For three years, Altman and her husband lived in London. In 1952, she published The Law of the Vultures. The book was based on her experience working with the Springbok Legion. Not long after its publication and good critical reception internationally, a professor at the University of Witwatersrand called the book \\"subversive,\\" which caused many booksellers to return copies of the book. Altman joined the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU) in 1956 and quickly became very involved with the organization. Altman was the only full-time paid employee of SACTU between 1956 and 1963, where she worked as Assistant General Secretary. During this time, she kept in contact with South African unions and international unions, both. Her distribution of materials to libraries and trade unions around the world enabled the preservation of primary materials relating to SACTU. Altman represented SACTU at the Fourth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in 1957. During government sweeps in 1960, resulting in people becoming \\"emergency detainees,\\" Altman took refuge in Swaziland. She was banned in 1964 under the Suppression of Communism Act which prevented her from teaching and working with the unions. She left South Africa in 1964. Altman still helped SACTU, remotely, operating with others out of London. When Solly Sachs left the International Defence and Aid Fund (IDAF) in 1967, John Collins hired Altman to be in charge of administrative affairs. Altman was the general secretary of what was known as Programme 1, which helped secretly channel funds to defence lawyers in South Africa. She was very secretive about the system, using a secret code with her contacts and a system that was difficult to crack. Altman was also able to successfully deflect attempts by South African spy Craig Williamson, to infiltrate IDAF. Altman also edited books for IDAF under the Kliptown Books name. Collins died in 1982, and Altman stayed afterwards long enough to ensure that the reorganization was \\"firmly established,\\" and then retired. Altman was also involved in a programme that educated \\"Rhodesian blacks interned in camps.\\" Half of the cabinet of Robert Mugabe had degrees they had earned with Altman's help. Altman's role in working with IDAF became known after the release of Nelson Mandela. Altman died on 18 September 1999 in London.

Due to similarities of plot and dramatis personae, it is considered to be a German variant of the English play Hamlet, though possibly not William Shakespeare‚Äôs Hamlet, and is a problematic figure in discussions of Hamlet Q1 and the so-called Ur-Hamlet. Such discussions have helped to raise interest in the text, which primarily lived in obscurity before the discovery of Q1 in 1823. Fratricide Punished was first published in German from a written manuscript in 1781 and translated to English by Georgina Archer in 1865. Though the play is readily available online both in English and in German, the manuscript has been lost since its initial publication, and all subsequent editions of the text are, as such, at a remove from the original. Fratricide Punished is often referred to by its German title Der Bestrafte Brudermord, or Tragoedia der bestrafte Bruder-mord oder: Prinz Hamlet aus D√§nnemark.

While this may suggest a longer play, some scenes are quite scant. For instance, act three, scene seven contains just two sentences of dialogue from a single character. The play as published by Internet Shakespeare Editions runs approximately 545 lines. It contains minimal stage direction, restricting itself to character entrances, musical descriptions, and descriptors of physical action. The plot runs largely along the lines of the familiar Shakespearean Hamlet, but it differs on occasion both in its events and the order of those events, and is notable for its elements of comedic farce, which have been emphasized in various productions. The play begins with an induction, wherein Night, personified as a wicked, trickster-like figure, calls forth three \\"furies\\", Alecto, M√§gera, and Thisiphone, to assist her. She informs them that the new King of the land yearns for his sister-in-law and has murdered his brother‚Äîthe previous king‚Äîso that he might have her. Night wishes to cloud both their judgements to aid in their incestuous relationship but also to sow discord and jealousy into their marriage. She also intends to raise up a desire for revenge in those loyal to the slain king. Alecto, M√§gera, and Thisiphone agree to assist her. The play ends with an admonishment to those who would seek power through foul play to reconsider, as they will likely be repaid by similar means. The remainder of Fratricide Punished seems at once familiar to readers of Hamlet, yet at times strange. There are some important differences in the naming of characters. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these is Corambus, a name familiar in Q1 Hamlet but changed to Polonius in Q2 and the folio editions of Shakespeare's text. Corambus' son, Leonhard, is similarly named Laertes in those texts. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are noticeably absent, their roles replaced in part by unnamed Ruffians. The text also creates the character of Phantasmo to undertake a variety of roles, often comically. Other notable differences include the lack of Hamlet's \\"to be or not to be\\" soliloquy, among others, and Ophelia's decision to commit suicide by jumping down a hill. One of the more \\"slapstick\\" differences comes when the Prince has been sent to England, accompanied by his would-be assassins. He foils their attempt on his life by having them stand on either side of him. At the moment the assassins shoot, Hamlet falls to the ground with the result that they shoot one another instead of him. Similarities and differences between Fratricide Punished, Q1 Hamlet, and the second quarto and folio editions of Hamlet are a powerful point of discussion in academic discussions.  History  Surprisingly little is known about the history of Fratricide Punished prior to its publication, and there is little academic consensus about its early origins. The German editor H.A.O. Reichard, who first published excerpts from the manuscript in his Theater- Kalender auf das Jahr 1779 and went on to publish the work in its entirety in 1781 in his journal Olla Potrida, confirms only that the original bore the text \\"Pretz, den 27. Oktober 1710\\" (Pretz, October 27, 1710). Later, Nino Amico, referencing work by University of Catania professor Ingrid Hiller, claimed that the manuscript of Fratricide Punished was of a small format and some thirteen pages. Hiller's research, however, appears not to have been published and others have been unable to corroborate this elsewhere, such that even these scant details remain unconfirmable. While the date of October 27, 1710 clearly places the manuscript in time, if not necessarily the time it was written, the location of Pretz remains disputed. It is known from the original publication by Reichard that he obtained the manuscript of Fratricide Punished from Konrad Ekhof, a theater manager and historian, who had recently died. Ekhof's father-in-law had started a theater company in the town of Preetz, a location in Pl√∂n, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, in 1710. This has led Oxford professor Tiffany Stern to assert that the \\"Pretz\\" annotation on the manuscript most likely refers to Preetz, intuiting that Ekhof must have received the text from his father-in-law. Amico, however, places the text at Kloster Preetz, a nunnery. Still others have argued that \\"Pretz\\" refers to either the towns of Graz, Austria or Pretzsch, Germany. Whatever answers the manuscript might have provided to these questions were lost when the manuscript itself was lost, at least as early as 1888. With regard to the date of its writing, many scholars believe Fratricide Punished to be a manuscript developed over years of English performances in Germany beginning as early as 1586. Kareen Klein, building off a sizable scholarly tradition, traces the lineage from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, where troupes of English comedians, forced abroad by closed theaters at home, began touring continental Europe. They brought with them an expanded understanding of acting that included such fields as pantomime, dance, and clowning. Such physical skills were uncommon for continental actors of the time and would be necessary for performers looking to convey the meaning of their English-language scripts to audiences who spoke only German. That language barrier would, in time, cause the scripts of staples such as Romeo and Juliet and Titus Andronicus, and perhaps Hamlet, to be modified into simpler, more physical forms. Over time, as English troupes came to augment their numbers with German actors, their scripts would be translated into German editions. = Translation into English = Reflecting the importance of Q1 Hamlet on the perceived relevance of Fratricide Punished, the text was first translated into English by Georgina Archer, not for the sake of the play itself but rather for Albert Cohn's 1865 book Shakespeare in Germany. R.G. Latham provided another translation in 1872. Claiming that Archer's translation attempted to too heavily mimic the style of Shakespeare, and citing minor differences with Latham, Furness supplied a new translation in his 1877 Variorum collection. More recently, Christine Schmidle produced a translation for her 2010 theatrical production of the play, an experience that led her to believe that much of the comical effect of the work was a result of language barriers and adaptation experienced and undertaken by English actors performing in German-speaking lands.  Significance  = Relationship to Hamlet = While scholars generally agree that Fratricide Punished is a memorial reconstruction descended from some form of Hamlet, it remains uncertain from which Hamlet it comes. The differences and similarities between Fratricide Punished and the three major forms of Hamlet were examined line-by-line by George Duthie in his 1941 criticism of the so-called \\"bad quarto\\" of Q1, and the Variorum of Furness published the texts side-by-side as well. Their analyses found a play that contained elements both of Q1 Hamlet, published in 1603 but unknown until 1823, and the more familiar versions of the second quarto (1604) and folio (1623), as well as elements uniquely its own. This is a remarkably problematic finding for Shakespeare scholars, complicating an area already made difficult by the discovery of Q1. Indeed, the majority of what has been written about Fratricide Punished exists strictly to better understand its relation to Q1 Hamlet, such that it becomes troublesome to discuss one without the other. Yet, as it contains elements of all three versions, it seems clear that Fratricide Punished must have been reconstructed by an actor with knowledge of more than one version of Hamlet. Kathleen Irace, in presenting this, argues that the use of the name Corambus instead of Polonius firmly ties Fratricide Punished to Q1, as does the \\"increased villainy\\" of the King, who alone is responsible for devising the poisoning plot. Yet, some elements exclusive to Q2 and F1 are found in the text as well. Irace points out that the first portion of the King's speech in Act I, Scene II is missing from Q1 Hamlet but oddly present in Fratricide Punished. Meanwhile, elements exclusive to the text or shared only with Q1 would seem to some scholars to link Fratricide Punished to the Ur-Hamlet, a kind of primordial source text which some scholars have suggested was used by Shakespeare in creating his Hamlet. The existence of the Ur-Hamlet is debated in itself. Lastly, Duthie argues that the long gap between the assumed time of the text's creation and its discovery is wholly unaccounted for, leaving room for any number of changes. Zachary Lesser, discussing the impact of Q1 Hamlet on the popular reception of Q2 and F1, demonstrates the way that both Q1 and Fratricide Punished have been used to support arguments from multiple camps across decades of time, a testament to the ongoing significance of the work.  Production History  Though it may have been born from production, few productions of Fratricide Punished have been undertaken since its discovery. In 1924, William Poel, a British actor and theater manager who had staged a production of Q1 Hamlet in 1881, mounted a production of the play in Oxford, England at the New Oxford Theatre. His promptbook, later published, contends that the audience met the characters with a derision and laughter far removed from the typical experience of Hamlet audiences. Joe Falocco argues that, by choosing to perform both Q1 and Fratricide Punished, Poel was demonstrating a willingness to disregard the importance of Shakespeare's authorship in the text, in accordance with earlier understandings of authorship, a constant facet of Hamlet discussions. This is not to say that Fratricide Punished is without influence on theatrical productions. Both Q1 Hamlet and Fratricide Punished place their scenes in a different order than do the Q2 and folio versions of Hamlet, and this may have inspired stage directors to reorder their own productions of Hamlet in turn. = U.S. Productions = A version of Fratricide Punished was performed at the NADA theater in New York City for the Hamlet Festival of 1994 alongside a rap version of Hamlet entitled \\"The Trage-D of Prince Hammy T.\\" The play was directed by Randolph Curtis Rand. According to one reviewer, Rand chose to abandon more staid stage interpretations of Hamlet in order to highlight the comical elements of Fratricide Punished. Toward that end, Hamlet himself was portrayed wearing a loud tuxedo costume reminiscent of John Travolta's character in Saturday Night Fever, while the characters of the induction were portrayed as though members of The Addams Family.  Puppet Productions  In 1981, Nino Amico suggested that Fratricide Punished was a play adapted for performance by puppets, sparking mild academic debate as well as the imagination of theater producers. The Hidden Room Theatre company, following up on the extensive research done by Tiffany Stern on Amico's claims, produced a puppet version that included live musical accompaniment and pyrotechnics. The initial production was performed in Staunton, Virginia at the American Shakespeare Center's reproduction of the Blackfriars Theater and went on for a full run in Austin, Texas. The company also performed Fratricide Punished at Shakespeare's Globe Theater, University College, Oxford, and the Shakespeare Institute, as well as at Villanova University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a talk from noted Shakespeare scholar Zachary Lesser of the University of Pennsylvania, and at other universities. It used a translation provided by Christine Schmidle, who had previously performed a German-language version of Fratricide Punished at the Center in 2010. The Hidden Room Theatre won multiple awards for their performance, which was renewed for the 2016 season. Despite this success, the central premise of the performance remains unconvincing to some. June Schlueter, responding to Tiffany Stern's article, saw no basis for the assumption that Fratricide Punished was a play designed for puppets. Instead, she claims that the elements which lend themselves to puppets, such as the plays slapstick humor and physicality, are the result of actors adapting the work to make it more accessible beyond language barriers‚Äîa theme that Christine Schmidle also explored in her German language production of the play.  German Language Production  Fratricide Punished was performed in German at the American Shakespeare Center in 2010. The performance was conceived by Christine Schmidle, who would go on to translate the play for the 2015 puppet show there. Schmidle, like many scholars, believed the work to be the result of English comedic actors touring continental Europe in the late 1500s. By performing the play in German to an English speaking audience, she hoped to replicate (albeit in reverse) the kind of problems that those actors would have experienced in conveying meaning across language barriers. In an essay published by the Shakespeare Bulletin, Schmidle described the kinds of abridgments and added physicality that her troupe undertook in creating a play that would be accessible to the audience. Ultimately, she decided that Fratricide Punished represented a kind of road map to the play's origins, and that her performance clearly demonstrated that the differences existing between Hamlet and the text were made entirely in order to better convey meaning.

History The first use of electricity on a significant scale in Thailand was the lighting of the Grand Palace on the occasion of the birthday of King Chulalongkorn's (Rama V) on 20 September 1884. The king took a great interest in electricity, particularly its potential for street lighting. Bangkok's first power plant was constructed by the German firm, AEG. It began producing power on 20 December 1913. A succession of power companies with concomitant name changes followed. Siam Electricity Company Limited was an early power company. In 1939 its name was changed to Thailand Electricity Corporation Company Limited. In 1950 its concession expired and it was taken over by the government, renaming it Bangkok Electricity Authority, operating under the aegis of the Interior Ministry. On 1 August 1958 the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) was established by merging the Bangkok Electric Works and the Electrical Division of the Public Works Department to be responsible for providing power supply in Bangkok, Nonthaburi, and Samut Prakan. For electricity provision in Thailand's other 74 provinces, it is supplied by the Provincial Electricity Authority. Operations MEA maintains 18 district offices and 12 branch offices in its service area. Maximum demand for power peaked at 8,669 MW in 2014.

Camp was the subject of a high-profile removal hearing before the Canadian Judicial Council for his role in a 2014 sexual assault trial that he presided over. The judicial committee recommended that he be removed from the bench. In 2018 Camp was reinstated into the Law Society of Alberta. Early life and education Camp was born and grew up in South Africa. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in commerce in 1973, and a bachelor of laws in 1975, from Stellenbosch University. Career From 1978 to 1997, Camp was a member of the Johannesburg Bar, where he was an advocate of the Supreme Court of the Transvaal. From 1992 to 1998, he worked in Gaborone, Botswana. In 1998, he moved to Calgary and continued to work as a lawyer. Camp worked as a civil litigator, primarily in the areas of contracts, trust, and oil and gas law. In 2012, he was appointed as a judge to the Criminal Division of the Provincial Court of Alberta. On June 26, 2015, despite the controversy over a 2014 sexual assault trial, Conservative Justice Minister Peter MacKay appointed Camp to the Federal Court of Canada. =2014 sexual assault trial= In 2014, Camp was presiding over a sexual assault trial. When the alleged rape victim was testifying, Camp asked her why she \\"couldn't just keep [her] knees together\\" or \\"sink your bottom\\" into the bathroom sink to avoid being raped. Camp also described her as \\"the accused\\" throughout the trial, criticized her for not screaming while the alleged assault took place, and suggested she wanted to have sex. He asked her why she didn't \\"skew her pelvis\\" to avoid penetration. He also said that \\"sex and pain sometimes go together, that ‚Äî that's not necessarily a bad thing.\\" Camp later acquitted the defendant Alexander Wagar. After acquitting him, he told the defendant, \\"I want you to tell your friends, your male friends, that they have to be far more gentle with women. They have to be far more patient. And they have to be very careful. To protect themselves, they have to be very careful.\\" In October 2015, the Court of Appeal of Alberta struck down Camp's decision and ordered a retrial. The court said that Camp seemed to not understand the laws on consent and an alleged rape victim's sexual activity, and that judge may have used \\"sexual stereotypes and stereotypical myths, which have long since been discredited.\\" In January 2017, Wagar was acquitted in a retrial. The presiding judge, Jerry LeGrandeur, found the complainant was inconsistent and lacked credibility. =Canadian Judicial Council complaint and hearings= In November 2015, four Alberta law professors made a complaint about Camp's conduct to the Canadian Judicial Council. Thirty different groups and people also later made complaints to the council. Critics called the comments \\"misogynistic\\" and Camp a \\"rape myth propagator.\\" On December 22, 2015, Alberta Attorney General Kathleen Ganley ordered the CJC to hold an inquiry. The hearing was only the eleventh time in the 45-year history of the CJC that an inquiry was held, and in only two of those cases did the CJC recommend removal. The Federal Court announced that Camp would not hear any cases involving sexual assault while the council investigated.  Committee hearing  The CJC assigned a committee made up of three judges and two lawyers for the initial hearing. The hearing was held in September 2016. The alleged sexual assault victim testified, saying his comments had left her feeling confused, guilty and suicidal. Camp apologized at the hearing, and said that he had undergone counseling with experts to improve his understandings of sexual assault. He acknowledged that his knowledge of Canadian criminal law while he served as a judge at the sexual assault was \\"non-existent.\\" As he addressed the Panel, Camp again referred to the alleged rape victim as \\"the accused\\" and characterised her as a \\"fragile personality.\\" During the inquiry, University of Toronto law professor Brenda Cossman, a \\"leading Feminist law professor\\" hired by Camp to educate him on rape myths characterized his remarks insensitive, but that they were part of his attempts to get clarity on the details. According to Cossman, Camp's questions stemmed from prosecution and defense positions around the nature of consent and the details of the alleged assault, \\"To me, he was trying to address, albeit not in a very sensitive manner, issues already put into play by the defense and the Crown.\\" His comments regarding her knees took place during testimony establishing that the woman's pants were down by her feet, which pushed her legs nearly together. Likewise his comments on sex and pain were during a technical legal discussion on the nature of consent, and whether pain means a lack of consent.  Committee decision  On November 29, 2016, the committee recommended, by a 5‚Äì0 vote, that Camp be removed from the bench. The committee concluded that \\"Camp‚Äôs conduct is so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of the impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office.\\" The committee's recommendation was then considered by the CJC.  CJC decision and resignation  On March 9, 2017, the CJC recommended, by a 19‚Äì4 vote, that Parliament remove Camp from office. Camp submitted his resignation the same day. = Reinstatement = A public hearing was held November 17, 2017 and on May 22, 2018 the Law Society of Alberta reinstated Robin Camp as a lawyer in Alberta.

It is about long. History The street was previously much longer and stretched as far north as Oxford Street. The first section of the street was built in 1671 as Swallow Close, and was named after the 16th-century tenant Thomas Swallow. On John Ogilby's map of London in 1681, it is shown as running as far as Beak Street, which continues to what is now Oxford Street. Beak Street was developed by the end of the 17th century, and the road became known as Little Swallow Street as far as Glasshouse Street, then Swallow Street to Oxford Street, ending opposite Princes Street. It was the main road between Piccadilly and Oxford Street by the 18th century, and is marked as such on John Rocque's Map of London, 1746. In 1815, the majority of the street was demolished to construct Regent Street, a modern thoroughfare designed by John Nash. The former line of Swallow Street is roughly now where properties on the west site of Regent Street are. A small section of Swallow Street survives to the south, where Regent Street bends away at the Quadrant to reach Piccadilly Circus. The northern part of the street also survives as Swallow Passage and Swallow Place, parallel to the west of Regent Street. Properties =Churches= Front elevation of 1801 plans for a new Swallow Street Scotch Church building Richard Baxter, a Puritan church leader, preached from rooms hired in Swallow Street between April and November 1676. Thomas Tenison, a future Archbishop of Canterbury, is recorded to have established a chapel of ease in Swallow Street in the late 17th century, during the 1680-1691 period of his incumbency of St Martin-in-the-Fields, and perhaps in response to the huge rise in the population of the parish, from 19,000 in 1660 to 69,000 in 1685. Thomas Frognall Dibdin for a time held a preachership at the chapel. A Huguenot chapel, L'Eglise de Piccadilly, and known as the French Chapel was opened on Swallow Street in 1694 by a congregation removing from York Street. It continued until circa 1709, when the chapel lease was taken by a Scottish Presbyterian congregation which had previously met at Glasshouse Street. The church, led by James Anderson, was known as the Scotch Church, and during Anderson's life - perhaps in 1734 - a new meeting-house was built on Swallow Street. The merchant and philanthropist Alexander Birnie was an elder.Janette Holcomb, Early merchant families of Sydney, Australian Scholarly publishing, Melbourne, 2013. Page 43. The Presbyterian built a new church on Swallow Street in the 1801-1804 period. The missionary Robert Morrison was ordained at the Scotch Church in 1807. The church failed in the 1840s, and the lease was taken by Colonel Somers Lewis of the 4th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer, who converted the church into a drill hall. The lease was bought in 1884 by Charles Voysey, a Church of England cleric who had been deprived of his living for the unorthodoxy of his popular printed sermons. In 1885 he created a Theistic Church, which he maintained until his death in 1912, after which it split into two sects, one retaining the original name, the other the \\"Free Religious Movement\\". The building's lease was ended in 1915 and the church building demolished in the same year. Olive Willis attended and George May, 1st Baron May was married there. =Entertainment= The Goat & Star pub was at No. 12 and contained a music hall. It was rebuilt in 1899 and renamed the Swallow, incorporating a concert hall. In 1919, it was turned into offices. The Flyfishers' Club was based in Swallow Street from 1907 to 1941.

Inflorescences are white or grey-white with purple-brown spotting or veining and a small blackish or dark purple signal patch with a sparse, purple or dark purple beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it needs very dry conditions during the summer. The species is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN. Description The species is very similar in form to Iris sofarana, another Oncoyclus iris, from Syria and Lebanon. It has a short and compact brown rhizome,British Iris Society (1997) thick secondary roots and fine root hairs. Above the rhizome, there are 5-8 curved or falcate leaves of green or grey-green color. The narrow leaves, Leaves can grow up to long and up to 1 cm wide. They fade in winter and reappear in spring. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow tall. The stem has 1 or 2 spathes (leaf of the flower bud), which are inflated, slightly pale violet-purple tinged and up to long. It holds one terminal (top of stem) flower, blooming between March, and April. The large flowers are between in diameter. They are bi-coloured, and have a creamy white, grey-white, or white ground, which is covered in brown-purple, or purple, veining, or spotting. The veining is similar to the veining on the flowers of I. sofarana.

They have thinner, or finer veining and small dots than the falls. They have anthers about 2.5 cm long. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule that has not yet been described. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. A 1977 analysis of the genome of 47 species of Oncocyclus irises showed that the species has a chromosome count of 2n=20. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet damascena refers to coming from Damascus, Syria.David Gledhill In 1693, the name Iris damascena was used for a species of Polyanthus,Richard Weston John Ray (Editor) This name was later ignored due to Linnaeus' genus re-classification in 1753. On 23 March 1951, a specimen of the iris (now stored at the Herbarium Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de la Ville de Gen√®ve in Switzerland) was collected from a mountain in Syria. In 1957, the species and several other iris species from Syria were described by Werckmeister. The species was first formally described by Paul Mouterde in 'Nouv. Fl. Liban & Syrie' Vol.i n page 318 in 1966. Distribution and habitat The species is known only from the eastern slopes of Mount Qasioun north of Damascus, part of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range. It grows on calcareous soils in association with low alpine vegetation and grasses, at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation When first described by Mouterde in 1966, the species was assessed as \\"at risk\\" due to human collection of the rhizomes and the selling of the flowers in the roadside trade. The species was reported by Chaudhary in 1975 to be in danger of extinction, and although it was declared 'extinct' by some sources in 2013,Christopher Cumo (Editor) as of 2016 it is assessed as Critically endangered by the IUCN. An estimated 100 clumps of plants currently remain. A field study in 2011 declared the species to be highly endangered. The Syrian government has not yet given the species any protected status. The remaining population may benefit from the fact that part of its habitat is in a military area near the 'Qassioun Republican Guards Military Base' and other military facilities, which stops civilians accessing the area. The base and steepness of the habitat also stops construction or development. Cultivation The species is very rare in cultivation due to being highly endangered. If grown, it prefers to grow in a sunny, well drained, rocky habitat. In northern Europe or the US, it needs to be planted under glass within a greenhouse or glasshouse, in an alkaline soil (with limestone chippings). It should be planted in March, then dug up in September or October and stored in wood shavings. The plants can be harmed by aphids. =Hybrids and Cultivars= I. damascena has two known cultivars: 'Qassioumensis' and 'Magnifica'. The latter, also known as 'I. Damascena cv. Magnifica', is cream-colored with purple markings, dark purple signal and purple beard. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Further reading * Mathew, B. The Iris. 1981 (Iris) 48-49.

Al- Khulaifi was arrested in Qatar in March 2011 and held for a month without charge. Both before and after his arrest, al-Khulaifi advocated for individuals with close connections to terrorist organizations. Views Between early 2009 and 2010, Al-Khulaifi wrote a blog which recorded his personal and political views. In April 2009, al-Khulaifi published a post addressed to the Emir and people of Qatar. In the post, al-Khulaifi criticised the Qatari government for holding secular and what he called ‚Äúblasphemous‚Äù laws about alcohol consumption, bars, and discos. He held the government responsible for the spread of prostitution. Al-Khulaifi called the government \\"un-Islamismic\\" because it did not follow the selected Qur'anic texts he provided in his post. Al-Khulaifi also criticised the policies of the Qatar government concerning Israel. Al-Khulaifi objected to the visit of the Israeli politician, Shimon Peres to Doha. He suggested the Qatar government should sever diplomatic communications with Israel. Al-Khulaifi objected to United States military forces having a presence in Qatar from which to operate in Iraq and Afghanistan. Al-Khulaifi names Sayyid Qutb‚Äôs Milestones as his favorite book. Milestones is based on the Qutbic Islamist ideology. Human rights activism Until 2010, Al-Khulaifi served as Secretary-General of the Alkarama Foundation, a Swiss based human rights non-governmental organisation. The Alkarama Foundation stated that al-Khulaifi had left the organization in 2010 \\"to found a new organization for the defense of human rights\\". In early 2013, Doha News reported that al-Khulaifi was working with the Geneva- registered Adel Group for Human Rights. The Adel Group for Human Rights primarily examines cases of detention in Qatar. Al-Khulaifi wrote on his blog about such cases. Arrest and detention On March 2, 2011, al-Khulaifi was arrested at approximately 9 p.m. at his Doha residence by state security agents. The agents searched his house and car for two hours. Alkarama reported that an officer informed al-Khulaifi's wife that the agents had been sent by the Attorney General but that they were unable to produce a judicial warrant. Alkarama was concerned the arrest related to al-Khulaifi's work in the field of human rights. Al-Khulaifi was detained for a month. Following al-Khulaifi's arrest, Amnesty International released a statement of concern which said al- Khulaifi was at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Al Jazeera noted that Al-Khalaifi's last blog post prior to his arrest had criticized censorship in Qatar. His lawyer stated that he was detained \\"just for expressing his own opinion, it must be, because [he] was detained three, four, or ten times already by special security and he's still insisting in his own opinion\\". The Qatari government declined to comment. Al-Khalaifi was released with charge in April. = Reactions = Amnesty International criticized the arrest, calling for al-Khalaifi to have access to his lawyer and family and be guaranteed a fair trial and protection against torture. Front Line described his arrest as \\"directly related to his legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human rights\\" and called for his release; Index on Censorship also described him as an imprisoned \\"human rights activist\\". Freedom House discussed the incident in its 2012 Freedom in the World report alleging state censorship in Qatar, and Reporters Without Borders included al-Khalaifi on its list of imprisoned netizens. US conservative watchdog Accuracy in Media later criticized the reporting of the Qatar-owned network Al Jazeera on the al-Khalaifi case, for an article which concluded \\"The Qatari government could not be contacted for comment\\". A spokesman asked, \\"How could they not get comment from the very regime that owns them? That just doesn't make any sense.\\" Controversies and ties to extremism =Alkarama= Two of the Alkarama Foundation's founding members, Abdulrahman al-Nuaimi and Abd al-Wahhab al-Humayqani, have been listed as \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorists\\" by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Alkarama Foundation is alleged to have funded Islamist groups fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The president of the Alkarama Foundation, Mohamed Rabaan, is a member of the Global Anti- Aggression Campaign, a group led by Safar bin Abdul Rahman al-Hawali, a former mentor of Osama bin Laden.Bergen, Peter L. Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden. New York: Free, 2001. Print. The Global Anti- Aggression Campaign, which also lists al-Nuaimi as a member, has supported and hosted members of Hamas. The Alkarama Foundation said that al-Khulaifi had contacted the foundation regarding the arbitrary detention of Abdullah Ghanem Mahfouz Muslim Jouar and Salim Hassan Khalifa Rashid al-Kuwari. Jouar, referred to as \\"al-Khawar\\" by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is a member of an al-Qaeda network. According to the Department of the Treasury, Jouar delivered money, messages, and other material support to al-Qaeda elements in Iran and facilitated travel of members to Afghanistan for jihad. Al-Kuwari, who was based in Qatar was listed by the Department of Treasury as a member of the same network. The listing recorded that al-Kuwari \\"has provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in financial support to al-Qaeda and has provided funding for al-Qaeda operation\\". Like Jouar, al-Kuwari has facilitated travel for extremist recruits on behalf of Iran-based senior al-Qaeda members. Alkarama forwarded the concerns for the two men to the Qatari government in the hope of their release. =Association to French Embassy letter= On March 22, 2013, Muhammad Issa al-Bakr and Mansour bin Rashed al-Matroushi were arrested. They were accused of sending a threatening letter sent to the French embassy in protest of France's presence in Mali. According to a Doha News service, the letter demanded that the French government immediately cease its military campaign in Mali \\"or else you (the French) will be exposing yourselves to the wrath of people who love death as much as you love life\\". The letter also accused France of killing and torturing Malian Muslims and described France's policies as \\"terrorist\\" and \\"racist\\". Al-Khulaifi stated that \\"the letter we sent to the French Embassy carried no threat. It was advice.\\" The men were placed in solitary confinement from March 23 to March 27, 2013. They were released on April 18, 2013 and were subject to a travel ban. The Doha News service claimed that al-Khulaifi was an associate of the men. Al-Bakr was a coordinator of the Madad Ahl al-Sham charity which was likely a front for an al-Nusra Front financier.

Many of its organizers had participated in the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, two weeks earlier in Seneca Falls, a smaller town not far away. The Rochester convention elected a woman, Abigail Bush, as its presiding officer, making it the first public meeting composed of both men and women in the U.S. to do so. This controversial step was opposed even by some of the meeting's leading participants. The convention approved the Declaration of Sentiments that had first been introduced at the Seneca Falls Convention, including the controversial call for women's right to vote. It also discussed the rights of working women and took steps that led to the formation of a local organization to support those rights. Many of the organizers of the convention were part of a group of Quaker dissidents who had begun to associate with the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, the site of the convention. This group included the family of Daniel and Lucy Anthony, whose daughter, Susan B. Anthony, later became the most prominent national leader of the women's suffrage movement. History =Background= Early women's rights activists had to deal with the prevailing belief that a woman was obligated to let her husband or other male relative speak for her in public settings. There was bitter opposition to the idea of women voicing their opinions to \\"promiscuous audiences,\\" the name that was given to audiences that contained both men and women. In 1837, the Congregational Church of Massachusetts, a major force in that state, issued a pastoral letter to be read in every congregation that sharply criticized this practice, claiming it would \\"threaten the female character with wide-spread and permanent injury.\\"\\"Pastoral Letter of the General Association of Massachusetts,\\" 1837. Quoted in McMillen (2008), p. 63. Also see pp. 60‚Äì67. Despite the hostility, a small but growing number of women insisted on speaking out, especially in opposition to slavery. Some male abolitionists encouraged this practice while others refused to accept it. Disputes about the role of women began to disrupt the abolitionist movement, contributing to a split at a convention in 1840. Similar tensions were developing within educational institutions, which were just beginning to admit women at higher levels, and within the temperance movement. Concerned women activists in western New York organized the first women's rights convention, the Seneca Falls Convention, to discuss the rights of women on July 19‚Äì20, 1848 in the village of Seneca Falls.McMillen (2008), pp. 46‚Äì71. They called for similar conventions to be organized around the country. =Convention= Two weeks after the Seneca Falls Convention, several of its participants organized a follow-up convention in Rochester, New York, a city not far to the west that was the home of a number of reform activists. Like the earlier convention, the Rochester convention was open to anyone who was interested. Lucretia Mott, a prominent Quaker reform activist and an experienced public speaker who had been visiting the area from Philadelphia, was a featured speaker at Seneca Falls. At the plea of her friend Amy Post, one of the organizers of the Rochester convention, Mott agreed to stay in the area long enough to attend that convention also.Faulkner, Carol (2011). Lucretia Mott's Heresy: Abolition and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America, p. 142. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania. . The organizers gathered for a preliminary meeting on the day before the convention in Mechanics Protection Hall in Rochester to propose a slate of officers. Controversially, that slate included a woman, Abigail Bush, as president.Proceedings of the Rochester Convention, p. 1. The nominating committee consisted of Amy Post, Sarah D. Fish and Rhoda De Garmo. The other nominees for convention officers were: Laura Murray, vice- president; Elizabeth McClintock, Sarah L. Hallowell and Catherine A. F. Stebbins, secretaries. Mary H. Hallowell was elected as one of the secretaries when McClintock declined her nomination. McKelvey provides the full name of the Mechanics Protection Hall, which is simply called Protection Hall in the \\"Proceedings.\\" Abigail Bush The Rochester Convention met on August 2, 1848 in First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which \\"was filled to overflowing.\\"Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), p. 75. Amy Post called the convention to order and read the proposed slate of officers. Elizabeth McClintock, who was proposed as one of the convention's three secretaries, declined that position because she disagreed with the nomination of a woman as president. Bush's nomination as presiding officer was also opposed by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who \\"thought it a most hazardous experiment to have a woman President\\". (Mott and Stanton were key organizers of the Seneca Falls Convention, which had conceded to tradition by electing a man as its presiding officer.) Despite the misgivings of some of its most prominent members, the Rochester Convention elected Abigail Bush as its president, making it the first public meeting composed of both men and women in the U.S. to have a woman as its presiding officer. She conducted the meeting in a competent manner, quickly dispelling doubts about the wisdom of the convention's action.Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), p. 76. Bush later said, \\"at the close of the first session Lucretia Mott came forward, folded me tenderly in her arms and thanked me for presiding... When I found that my labors were finished, my strength seemed to leave me and I cried like a baby. But that ended the feeling with women that they must have a man to preside at their meetings.\\"Letter from Abigail Bush to Susan B. Anthony, 1898, reproduced by the University of Rochester Library in \\"Upstate New York and the Women's Rights Movement: The Seneca Falls and Rochester Conventions\\". Four years later, Mott herself presided at the Third National Women's Rights Convention in Syracuse.Gurko (1974), p. 159. Stanton afterwards apologized for her \\"foolish conduct\\" at the Rochester convention in a letter to Amy Post, saying, \\"My only excuse is that woman has been so little accustomed to act in a public capacity that she does not always know what is due to those around her.\\"Letter from Stanton to Amy Post, September 24, 1848, as quoted in McMillen (2008), p. 96 and footnote 53 on pp. 266‚Äì267. The secretaries of the convention were not accustomed to speaking in public. When they attempted to read the minutes of the preliminary meeting, they were unable to speak loudly enough to be heard throughout the room. Bush asked the audience to remember that the movement was still in its infancy and to listen with sympathy to speakers who had \\" trembling frames and faltering tongues.\\" Sarah Anthony Burtis, a schoolteacher with experience in making her voice heard, volunteered to read the minutes. The convention easily approved the Declaration of Sentiments that had been introduced at the Seneca Falls Convention, including the controversial demand for women's right to vote. Two African American men, Frederick Douglass and William Cooper Nell, both of whom were ardent abolitionists, spoke in favor of women's rights at the Rochester Convention.Wellman (2004), p. 212. A few men engaged women activists in debate, arguing, for example, that a marriage of equal partners could not possibly work because there would be no one to make the final decision in case of disagreement. Lucretia Mott replied that she knew of such marriages within the Quaker community, and they were functioning well.Proceedings of the Rochester Convention, pp. 13‚Äì14. The convention included a discussion of the rights of working women. It called for equal pay for equal work, and it assigned a Mrs. Roberts the task of establishing a committee to investigate the condition of working women in Rochester. After the convention, she set up the Woman's Protection Union in Rochester. McKelvey, the Rochester City Historian, said that, \\"Mrs. Roberts was apparently Mrs. Ruth Roberts, widow of the E. J. Roberts who had formerly edited The Rochester Craftsman, a paper which had displayed an interest in the workingman's movement led in New York by Frances Wright and Robert Dale Owen.\\" Mott thanked the Rochester Unitarians for allowing a women's rights convention to meet in their church. A few years earlier, she said, when the Female Moral Reform Society of Philadelphia asked if they could hold their annual conference in a church, they were given permission to meet only in the basement and only if they agreed that women would not be permitted to speak. The society was obliged to bring in one clergyman to preside over the conference and another to read the reports that the women had prepared.Proceedings of the Rochester Convention, p. 5. Newspapers in other communities generally were quite hostile to women's rights activities, but local newspaper coverage of this convention had a mixed nature. The Rochester Democrat said, \\"This has been a remarkable convention... The great effort seemed to be to bring out some new, impracticable, absurd, and ridiculous proposition, and the greater its absurdity the better.\\"Quoted in Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), p. 804. According to Hewett (2001), p. 134, this quote comes from the August 3, 1848 issue of the newspaper, which she refers to as the Daily Democrat. It approved, however, of the steps the convention had taken to ease the plight of working women. The Rochester Daily Advertiser made stereotyped references to men wearing petticoats and women wearing pants, but it approvingly noted that, \\"the discussions of the convention evinced a talent for forensic efforts seldom surpassed.Quoted in Hewett (2001), p. 134. Hewett does not provide the date for this issue of the newspaper. =Related information= The Rochester Convention was organized primarily by a group of Hicksite Quakers who had resigned from their local congregation in the mid-1840s after it disapproved of their public involvement in anti-slavery activities.Wellman (2004), pp. 119, 207, 211. About 200 Quakers with similar views had split from the main Quaker body in the area earlier in 1848 to form an organization called the Congregational Friends, later called the Progressive Friends. See Judith Wellman, \\"The Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention: A Study of Social Networks\\" in Journal of Women's History 3/1 (Spring 1991), Indiana University Press. Several member of that group subsequently associated with the First Unitarian Church, a center for reform activity and the site of the convention. Sanford's history says, \\"Our church was probably by strong majority abolitionist, an earnest group of Hicksite Quakers having attached themselves to the church as their own meeting grew inactive and faded out‚Äîthe Anthonys, Hallowells, Willises, Posts, Fishes, etc.\\" Of these, the Anthony family was particularly significant. Daniel and Lucy Anthony attended the Rochester Convention along with Mary Stafford Anthony, one of their daughters. Susan B. Anthony, another daughter, was teaching school in central New York at the time and did not attend the Rochester Convention. She later became, however, the most prominent national leader of the women's suffrage movement. The History of Woman Suffrage, the first volume of which was written in 1881 by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage, said the participants in the Seneca Falls Convention knew they had more to discuss, so they \\"adjourned, to meet in Rochester in two weeks.\\" In parliamentary procedure, an \\"adjourned meeting,\\" also called a \\"continued meeting,\\" is the name given to a meeting that is a continuation of an earlier meeting. The Rochester Convention is sometimes called the Adjourned Convention in Rochester.For an example of a reference to the \\"Adjourned Convention in Rochester,\\" see The next women's rights convention after Rochester was the one in Ohio Women's Convention at Salem, Ohio in April, 1850, which, like the Seneca Falls and Rochester conventions, was a regional meeting. The first in a series of National Women's Rights Conventions met in Worcester, Massachusetts In October, 1850.Wellman, Judith (2008).

The major difference between SAPT and supermolecular EDA methods is that, as the name suggests, SAPT computes the interaction energy directly via a perturbative approach. One consequence of capturing the total interaction energy as a perturbation to the total system energy rather than using the subtractive supermolecular method outlined above, is that the interaction energy is made free of BSSE in a natural way. Being a perturbation expansion, SAPT also provides insight into the contributing components to the interaction energy. The lowest-order expansion at which all interaction energy components are obtained is second-order in the intermolecular perturbation. The simplest such SAPT approach is called SAPT0 because it neglects intramolecular correlation effects (i.e., it is based on Hartree-Fock densities). SAPT0 captures the classical electrostatic interaction of two charge densities and exchange (or Pauli repulsion) at first-order, and at second-order the terms for electrostatic induction (the polarization of the molecular orbitals in the electric field of the interacting atom/molecule) and dispersion (see London dispersion) appear, along with their exchange counterparts. E_{\\\\rm int}^{\\\\rm SAPT0}=E_{\\\\rm elst}^{(1)}+E_{\\\\rm exch}^{(1)}+E_{\\\\rm ind}^{(2)}+E_\\\\text{exch- ind}^{(2)}+E_{\\\\rm disp}^{(2)}+E_\\\\text{exch-disp}^{(2)} Higher terms in the perturbation series can be accounted for using many-body perturbation theory or coupled-cluster approaches. Alternatively, density functional theory variants of SAPT have been formulated. The higher-level SAPT methods approach supermolecular coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] in accuracy.

Both of these were regional gatherings in western New York State. The Salem convention was the first women's rights convention to be organized on a statewide basis.Wellman, Judith (2008). \\"The Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention and the Origin of the Women's Rights Movement\\", pp. 15, 84. National Park Service, Women's Rights National Historical Park. Wellman is identified as the author of this document here. The first to be organized on a national basis was the National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts in October, 1850. Salem was a center for reform activity. Its inhabitants included a number of anti-slavery activists, many of them Quakers. The Anti-Slavery Bugle, an abolitionist newspaper, was published in Salem beginning in 1845.\\"Anti-Slavery Bugle\\", Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.\\" Library of Congress. A local group of the Progressive Friends, an association of Quakers who separated from the main body partly so they could be freer to work for such causes as abolitionism and women's rights, was formed in Salem in 1849.Thomas, Allen C., (November, 1920). \\"Congregational or Progressive Friends.\\" Bulletin of Friends' Historical Society of Philadelphia, Vol. 10, No. 1. p. 28. The local school board was composed of abolitionists from both wings of that movement: the followers of William Lloyd Garrison, who opposed involvement in political activity, and supporters of the Liberty Party, an abolitionist political party. All eight members of the school board had female relatives who participated in the Salem convention.Isenberg (1998), p. 216. Betsy Mix Cowles The call to the Salem convention declared that its purpose would be, \\"[T]o secure to all persons the recognition of equal rights, and the extension of the privileges of government without distinction of sex, or color\\".Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), p. 103. Betsy Mix Cowles was elected president of the convention. Cowles, who had ties to both wings of the abolitionist movement, was a long-time advocate for the rights of African Americans. She led the campaign against laws that discriminated against black children in public schools in Ohio.Isenberg (1998), pp. 19‚Äì20. In 1835 she became the leader of the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Ashtabula County. Jane Elizabeth Jones, an abolitionist lecturer, gave the convention's main address. Josephine Griffing, another prominent activist against slavery and for women's rights, served on the business committee.Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), p. 104. All of the convention's officers were women. Men were not allowed to vote, sit on the platform or speak during the convention. The male spectators were supportive, however, and when the convention was over, they created an organization of their own and endorsed the actions of the women's convention.Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), p. 110. The convention met less than a month prior to the opening of the state convention that revised the Ohio state constitution in 1850‚Äì1851. The Salem convention approved a memorial that was forwarded to the constitutional convention along with 8000 signatures.Isenberg (1998), pp. 15‚Äì17. The memorial concluded by saying: > The law should sustain and protect all who come under its sway, and not > create a state of dependence and depression in any human being. The laws > should not make woman a mere pensioner on the bounty of her husband, thus > enslaving her will and degrading her to a condition of absolute dependence. > Believing that woman does not suffer alone when subject to oppressive and > unequal laws, but that whatever affects injuriously her interests, is > subversive of the highest good of the race, we earnestly request that in the > New Constitution you are about to form for the state of Ohio, women should > be secured, not only the right of suffrage, but all the political and legal > rights that are guaranteed to men.\\"Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), p. 105.

He is particularly important as the author of Medulla destillatoria, a work of Paracelsian iatrochemistry which was published in many editions for well over a century. Life Conrad Khunrath was born around 1555 to the Leipzig merchant Sebastian Kunrat and his wife Anna. He had at least ten younger siblings, among them Heinrich Khunrath, who became known as an alchemist in his own right. By 1562, Conrad, still a child, had enrolled at Leipzig University, though this seems to have been only pro forma. In his youth, Conrad traveled around England where he learned the English language. He is known to have worked as a merchant from 1580; after the death of his father, Conrad also took over the cloth and vitriol trade. Subsequently, Khunrath expanded his professional activities into medical practice. His medications relied on spagyric or alchemical processes he developed himself. By 1594, Khurath resided in Schleswig. There he published the first edition of his magnum opus Medulla destillatoria, as well as a number of ancillary works and later editions. From about 1606 Khunrath worked as coin controller for the mint in Hamburg, managing the upheavals of the Kipper und Wipper financial crisis. He died, probably in Hamburg, shortly before 6 May 1613.See Max Bahrfeldt, ed., Nieders√§chsisches M√ºnzarchiv, vol. IV (Halle/Saale, 1930), 106, 122, 248.

Employees who work overtime hours experience numerous mental, physical, and social effects. Significant effects include stress, lack of free time, poor work-life balance, and health risks. Employee performance levels could also be lowered. Long work hours could lead to tiredness, fatigue, and lack of attentiveness. As a result, suggestions have been proposed for risk mitigation. Health and safety The health and safety effects of overtime work vary widely and much remains unknown. Some studies have reported numerous adverse health effects, including increased alcohol and tobacco usage, decreased birthweight in offspring, and decreased cognitive functioning found both subjectively and objectively using specialized testing. However, other studies have not established such relationships between overtime work and decreased health. Work shifts lasting 9‚Äì12 hours, work shifts exceeding 12 hours, and work weeks exceeding 40 hours have each demonstrated‚Äîin some studies‚Äîvarying levels of decreased cognitive testing performance and increased workplace injury. Inconsistencies between studies may be secondary to numerous workplace and employee factors, which make it difficult for researchers to establish specific causal relationships. A larger amount of data exist regarding the male workforce, whereas additional studies are needed to better assess impacts of overtime work and extended shifts on women. A survey about events between 1987 and 2000 found that in a cohort of 10,793 men and women, overtime work was associated with a 61% excess rate of injury compared to jobs without overtime. Injury rate was directly proportional to length of the work shift and number of hours in the work week. Study authors found excess injury risk not only associated with jobs that are more hazardous, but also with overall fatigue from working overtime and extended work shifts. Mental effects The mental effects on workers will vary based upon the work they do, the number of hours they work, and the individual working. Groupon performed a study in July 2016 on the effects of work. The results found that 38% work too much, 46% never had time to relax, and 60% of pollers have an unhealthy work-life balance. While this research showed some trends concerning the effects, other research has been performed to test the satisfaction levels of employees. A 2004 study of workers in Australia showed a trend that satisfaction levels decreased as the number of hours worked increased. They also stated that these effects could be lessened for those who enjoyed working extensive hours. These types of workers are more satisfied with their work-life balance. In addition to working satisfaction, another Australian longitudinal cohort study revealed poorer mental health in workers with long working hours. The authors conducted a 12-year longitudinal follow-up cohort consisting of 18,420 people and 90,637 observations. With the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) measure, they noted a 48% increased probability regarding mental health decline in those workers working 49‚Äì59 hours per week, compared with those under standard working hours (that is, 35‚Äì40 hours per week). The probability increased by 53% in those working more than 60 hours a week. They also found a difference by gender; among those working 49‚Äì59 hours per week, the SF-36 scores are lower among female than male, indicating worse mental health among female workers. These impacts can also be seen with working longer daily hours: even in the case of a 4-10 work week, with 40 hours spread over 4 days, the longer days were shown to have higher fatigue for government employees impacted. Similar gender differences were noted in other studies. In follow-up to the Whitehall study, a research team conducted a prospective cohort study following 2,960 middle-age full-time workers consisting of 2,248 men and 712 women. The results revealed a 267% increase in depression symptoms and a 284% increase in anxiety symptoms among those female workers working more than 55 hours per week, compared with those under standard working hours (35‚Äì40 hours per week). They also indicated a trend that for every 10-hour increase in weekly working hours, an associated 40% increase in depression symptoms and 31% increase in anxiety symptoms were noted. Similar trends were not noted among male workers. Similarly, Margot Shields surveyed 3,830 men and women between the ages of 25 and 54 who worked 35 hours or more per week between 1994 and 1997. She analyzed the relationship between working hours and depression. Her results found that women had increased likelihood of experiencing depression as more hours were worked. Suicidal ideation is another concern for overtime work. Research conducted in South Korea recruited 67,471 samples, and the results revealed 30% higher suicidal ideation among workers having working hours more than 60 hours (31% increase in male workers and 33% increase in female workers). There was also increased suicidal ideation noted among workers working for 51‚Äì60 hours per week in both males and females. In summary, mental effects related to overtime work include lower working satisfaction, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Among these, depression and anxiety are more predominant among female workers. Some research has proposed probable reasons for the gender difference. Female workers tend to take on more household responsibilities after work, which contributes to their mental stress. Also, female workers have been reported as relative minorities within the working place; at times experiencing lower job control, bullying, discrimination, etc.  Physical effects  Consecutive periods of working straight shifts, lack of breaks during the day, and consecutive days of working without a day off lead to decreased efficiency and productivity in workers. A synopsis of the book \\"Tired Cops: The Importance of Managing Police Fatigue\\" by Bryan Vila analyzed how these affected police officers in 2000. The abnormal work and sleep schedules were leading causes of the limited efficiency of police officers. This downturn in their effectiveness created unsafe environments for the communities around them. Long-term effects were researched by The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. They studied the link between overtime and the increased risk of cardiovascular disorder (CVD) events. Their results included evidence that showed that for people who worked at least 10 years for each additional hour worked, starting from the 46th hour, his or her risk of a CVD event increased by 1%. In addition to these health risks, Mar√≠a Beniell, who received her Ph.D. in Economics from the Center for Monetary and Financial Studies (CEMFI), researched the correlation between working long hours and the likelihood of individuals smoking, drinking, having a high body mass index (BMI), and being less physically active. The long-term effects of alcohol consumption include increased on-the-job injuries and loss of productivity, family problems, risk of high blood pressure, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, and more. The effects of smoking, in addition to similarities of the effects of alcohol, include increased risk of heart attacks, emphysema, and a large amount of cancers. Margot Shields' 1994‚Äì1997 study also analyzed the relationship between long hours and changes in weight, smoking, drinking, and exercising. For men, longer hours were associated with unhealthy weight gain. Increased smoking occurred for both men and women, and an increase in drinking existed for women. No relationship could be drawn regarding changes in physical activity. In Osaka, Japan, researchers completed a 5-year study on the effects of long work hours on hypertension in 1999. At the end of their study, they had surveyed 941 male Japanese white-collar workers. They concluded that long work hours are negatively-associated with the risk for hypertension. Authors of one paper performed a mental analysis on four published cohort studies and nineteen unpublished studies looking at the effect of \\"long working hours\\" (defined by the authors as 55 or more hours per week) to look for an association of developing Type II Diabetes compared to a referent group of workers only working 35‚Äì40 hours per week. They found that there was statistically-significant evidence for an association between longer working hours and development of Type II Diabetes, but only for individuals of low socioeconomic status such as manual laborers, when compared to other SES groups. The lower SES group working longer hours had a 29% increased risk of developing Type II diabetes; even after adjusting for physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, and obesity. However another author commented that residual confounding might account for this higher risk in the lower SES group compared to the higher SES group. They also postulated that sleep may be a mediator for this association, since inadequate sleep or sleep of poor quality / quantity can be a predictor of Type II diabetes. The workers in the lower SES group may have less control over their schedule, and this may include disruptive schedules interfering with circadian rhythm. One large-scale study using data from the Individual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working Population Consortium involving 85,494 workers from several European countries also looked at the effects of long work hours and the association with developing atrial fibrillation. These participants were free of atrial fibrillation at baseline. Mean age was 43.4 years. During follow up over 10 years, those working long hours (55 hours or more per week) were at 40% higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation compared to those working a standard 35-40 hour-week. In their study, the investigators controlled for age, sex, SES, smoking, BMI, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. The investigators also commented that this association between long working hours and atrial fibrillation appeared to be independent of classic risk factors of atrial fibrillation due to the similarities of the exposed group (long work hours) and the referent group. For Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), a meta- analysis of four prospective studies published in 2012 found a 1.4-fold increased risk of CHD associated with long working hours. The investigators also noted that this association was higher for men than women. They hypothesized underlying mechanisms for this association may include longer exposure to stress, sleep deprivation, and / or dysregulation of the HPA axis causing an increase in cortisol production. They also noted that this estimate might have been biased for several reasons. One reason could have been if workers with underlying CHD reduced their working hours in the years before a CHD event. A second reason could be due to confounding of SES. A meta-analysis adjusting for these factors found the risk of a CHD event to be 1.13 instead. Furthermore, the study authors also found a 1.3-times higher risk for those working long hours.  Social effects  Work-life balance is a major aspect of employees' lives. Naturally, the more hours someone works, the less time they will have to spend with their family or other leisure activities. In 2007, professors from Penn State Abington analyzed the tradeoff between working overtime and home and family life activities. A major finding was that workers struggled to take time off for personal or family needs. However, the additional income from working long hours could limit the actual impact of this loss of time. More specifically, the impact of having a child exponentially increased the impact of working overtime. Especially at a young age, it is very important in child development for the parents to be involved to provide care and positive experiences. Due to this reason, work-life conflicts arise much more frequently for parents, as stress levels are heightened. These effects are even worse for single parents.  Mortality risk  \\"Karoshi\\" (translated as worked to death) is a concern in Japan. A paper published in 2006 showed that over a quarter of Japan's workforce were working 50 hours or more per week with half of them working 60 hours or more per week. The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare launched an investigation in 2002 to examine 300 cases of possible Karoshi (death from being over-worked) during a time frame between 2002 and 2005. From their study, they recommended that employers offer a physician interview / guidance for any employee working over 100 hours overtime / month or if an employee requested a doctor's assessment. Overall research evidence has shown that long working hours increases mortality risk. A UK census-based longitudinal study of 414,949 people aged 20‚Äì64 years, showed that overtime work increases mortality risk in men working for more than 55 hours per week. The authors showed that mortality is higher in technical, semi-routine, or routine occupations (positions with high demand, low levels of control, or perceived imbalance between effort and reward). The authors also demonstrated that increased mortality risk was mainly attributed to cardiovascular disease. Similar results were found in other studies. A 30-year longitudinal study in Denmark of 5,249 employed Caucasian men aged 40‚Äì59 years showed that men working 41‚Äì45 hours per week had a 59% increased risk of mortality due to ischemic heart disease compared to men working less than 40 hours per week. The authors also found that physical fitness played a significant role, where among men with low physical fitness, those working more than 45 hours per week had more than twice the risk of death by ischemic heart disease compared to men working less than 40 hours per week; while this increased risk was not seen among the fittest men. Furthermore, a study based on data from the Swedish twin registry showed that there was an association between overtime work of more than 5 hours a week and increased mortality in women. This association was also seen in men, but only in the first five years of follow-up. In contrast, the authors showed that working less than five hours a week of overtime decreases the risk of mortality in men.  Counter arguments  Other studies argue that there is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between hours worked and short and long- term risks. Their claims include comments about factors that alter the outcome of effects. These include an individual's personality, occupation, and income. This research was done through a HILDA (Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia) survey in 2001 and was completed in 2004. Prior research into these counter-arguments was completed by a group of researchers in 1997. They found links between increased CVD events and mental health disorders along with decreases in production as the number of hours worked increased. However, they state that further research is necessary before definitive conclusions can be made, as factors of each individual have vast consequences on the effect of working overtime. In addition, workers who work overtime when it is not mandatory find that there are very minimal effects on their fatigue levels. In contrast, a Japanese study of 1,105 employees has demonstrated that longer working hours is associated with better health status in older employees. The authors of this study showed that overall health differed by age group, which reflects a generational difference with respect to their attitudes toward work. Among older workers, longer work hours might be beneficial as work-based social networks offer a structured environment, social support, and companionship.  Risk mitigation  While a definitive conclusion could not be made, suggestions exist to minimize the potential risks of long working hours. Creation of the work schedule should be managed properly to avoid multiple consecutive shifts, long periods of working without rest, and balanced breaks during the day. For families with children, it is very important that employees can manage their schedule for family or personal needs. This will help alleviate stress, provide flexible work hours throughout the year, and avoid many work-life conflicts. In 1981, Jay Kim and Anthony Campagna, researchers from Ohio State University, studied the effects Flextime. Flextime allows workers to change their start and end work time. They first analyzed a wide range of studies done on flextime. Then they separated 353 employees into two groups: one that allowed flextime, and one that did not (control group). Their study found that flextime largely reduced unpaid absences for employees. They also found a general increase in worker performance. Flextime could impact coordinating schedules and meetings, as employee work schedules may vary.

As one of the world's largest accumulations of recoverable oil, the recent discoveries in the Orinoco Belt have led to Venezuela holding the world's largest recoverable reserves in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia in July 2010. The Carabobo oil field is majority owned by Venezuela's national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA). Owning the majority of the Orinoco Belt, and its estimated 1.18 trillion barrels of oil in place, PDVSA is now the fourth largest oil company in the world. The field is well known for its extra Heavy crude oils, having an average specific gravity between 4 and 16 ¬∞API. The Orinoco Belt holds 90% of the world's extra heavy crude oils, estimated at 256 billion recoverable barrels. While production is in its early development, the Carabobo field is expected to produce 400,000 barrels of oil per day.  History  Despite no surface indications of petroleum, exploration led to a discovery well drilled in 1936, 25 miles north-northwest of Ciudad Bolivar. Drilled to a depth of 3,855 feet, 7 ¬∞API gravity oil was discovered in the Miocene tar sands. Nine months later, oil was struck again, this time in the current Giant Temblador field, 93 miles east-northeast. Preliminary exploration ended in 1967, and in 1987, Venezuelan consultant Anibal Martinez determined that the belt extends 285 miles westwards from Puerto Ordaz. Four fields were proposed from the six main producing areas in the belt. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's administration named the four fields from west to east; Boyac√°, Junin, Ayacucho, and Carabobo, with 36 licensing blocks. In 2010, the Carabobo field was split into three joint venture projects; Carabobo-1, Carabobo-2, and Carabobo-3. Formed in May 2010, the Carabobo-1 project is owned and operated by Petrocarabobo, a joint venture between PDVSA (60%), Repsol (11%), Petronas (11%), ONGC Videsh (11%), Indian Oil Corporation (3.5%) and Oil India (3.5%). In September 2013, Petronas announced its withdrawal from the project. The Carabobo-2 project is owned and operated by Petrovictoria, a joint venture between PDVSA (60%) and Rosneft (40%), formed in May 2013. The Carabobo-3 project is owned and operated by Petroindependencia, a joint venture formed in May 2010, composed of PDVSA (60%), Chevron Corporation (34%), Suelopetrol (1%) and Carabobo UK (JCU) - a joint venture between Mitsubishi, Japan Oil, Gas and Metal National Corporation (JOGMEC) and Inpex (5%). Due to the nature of extra heavy crudes, the oil produced from the Carabobo field has extremely high viscosities. Typical heavy crudes produced are around 10,000 cp, which is the viscosity of corn syrup. Recoveries in this area are naturally very low. As a result, emerging technologies have recently made recoveries high enough to produce the extra heavy crudes economically. Specifically, enhanced oil recovery methods have dramatically improved recoveries. Methods such as immiscible gas injection, polymer flooding, and in situ combustion, better known as fireflooding, have all seen limited success in the Carabobo field. However, steam injection and microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) have seen the most success. Microbial enhanced oil recovery, specifically, has received special attention. In 1999, Bognolo reported that biosurfactants not only reduced the viscosity of the Venezuelan heavy crude oils, but also increased their mobility in transport lines. Currently, the biodegradation of the heavy crudes has become an integral tertiary recovery method in the field, as it is a cost- efficient and eco-friendly way to drive the residual oil trapped in the reservoirs.  Geology  Carabobo is one of the four fields in the Orinoco Oil Belt. Located on the southern border of the East Venezuela Basin, the Orinoco Oil Belt extends 375 miles along the Orinoco River in the eastern part of Venezuela. The East Venezuela Basin is a foreland basin south of a fold belt formed from the progressive collision of the Caribbean plate and the passive margin of northern South America. Thrust faults associated with the fold belt resulted in the burial of Cretaceous and possibly older source rocks into the thermal window for oil. The Orinoco oil belt has many unique features from a geological point of view. All of these unique features are related to the tectonic events that formed the field. The first tectonic event that can be attributed to the formation of the field is when North America separated from Gondwanaland in the Late Triassic/Early Jurassic (~200 million years ago). The rifting in this period is represented by Late Jurassic basalts deposited in the Espino graben. This event led to the northern passive margin of South America. During the Cretaceous Period (~150 million years ago), the passive margin began to subside from organic rich sediments being deposited. This deposition includes the Querecual and San Antonio formations that would become source rocks for the Orinoco Oil Belt. The next tectonic event is referred to as a progressive collision of the Caribbean plate against the passive margin of northern South America. This collision occurred due to the continued movement of North America. As the Caribbean plate continues its eastward motion across the South American plate, it has continually collided with northern South America. These collisions began in the Eocene (~50 million years ago), became most intense in the Miocene (~25 to 10 million years ago) and continue through the present. This continuing collision led to the formation of thrust belts, which have been uplifted and eroded. Further south, flexural and isostatic uplift led to the uplift of the Guyana Shield. The uplift of the craton formed a foreland basin, known as the East Venezuela Basin, which received sediment from north flowing rivers. The Oficina, Merecure, and Freites sandstones were deposited in this period, which now contain most of the oil in the Orinoco oil belt. The Oficina formation is the primary reservoir rock in the Carabobo field. The thick shale sequence of the Carapita formation was eventually deposited in the foredeep to the north, which along with the Guyana Shield, became the seal for the reservoir. While the Guyana shield underwent erosion, the sediments were continually deposited in the East Venezuela Basin. This led to the burial of the Querecual and San Antonio formations, pushing them into the thermal window for oil. Due to the dipping of the formations against the Guyana Shield, the oil migrated updip a few hundred kilometers to the southern margin of the basin where it was then stratigraphically trapped. = Stratigraphy = Below is a figure of the stratigraphy of the Carabobo field. Three periods of deposition are prevalent, including the formation of the source rocks, reservoir rocks and seal. Faulting from the thrust belts are found throughout the field, and are known to trap oil. However, most of the oil can be found in the Miocene sandstones that are sealed by the Miocene mudstones and Guyana Shield. The source rocks, the Querecual and San Antonio formations, were formed in the Upper Cretaceous, and were organically rich. After burial, these source rocks were pushed into the thermal window for oil, and began to migrate updip into the Miocene sandstones. A stratigraphic pinch out of the Miocene Oficina formation sandstones against the Miocene Carapita mudstones created a trap for the oil of the Orinoco Belt to migrate updip from the deeper basin. A classic example of long distance migration, the oil from the Upper Cretaceous Querecual formation source rock travelled about 300 kilometers. In the Carabobo field, the reservoir tar sands are characterized by several depositional sequences of Miocene sandstones and mudstones. The reservoirs consist of the Oficina, Freites, and Merecure formations. Faulting and shale dispersion is common in these formations, leading to severe heterogeneity. This heterogeneity in the reservoirs severely reduce recovery efficiency in the field. Reservoirs have an average thickness of 60 meters and range in depth from 150 to 1,400 meters. thumb499x499pxFigure 2 Stratigraphy of the Orinoco Oil Belt = Source rock = The main source rocks for the Carabobo field are the Upper Cretaceous Querecual formation and San Antonio formation. The formations largely consist of black cherts and limestones and vary in hydrocarbon yield. It has been concluded that these formations entered the oil window progressively from north to south and thus proceeded to migrate updip. = Reservoir rock = The oil in the Carabobo field resides in the Oficina, Freites and Merecure sandstone formations. Formed in the Miocene era, these formations consist mostly of sands formed by the erosion of the uplifted Guyana Shield. The sands were carried along north flowing rivers of the time period and deposited on the southern margin of the East Venezuela Basin. Stratigraphically trapped, the reservoir contains extra heavy oil with an average gravity from 4 to 16 ¬∞API. = Trap and seal = The Oficina reservoir rocks are trapped by a stratigraphic pinch-out with the Guyana Shield. The thick shale sequence of the Carapita formation was deposited on top of the Oficina formation and provides the seal for the reservoir. Faulting is prevalent in the field, and known to occasionally trap oil. = Fluid migration = The Querecual is believed to have matured during the Oligocene (~33.9 to 23 million years ago), proceeding from north to south. During the fluid migration, the oil produced from the Upper Cretaceous Querecual formation underwent a drastic change. The oil was eventually trapped in the Oficina formation by the Guyana Shield and Carapita mudstones, but had to travel about 300 kilometers. Due to the long distance migration, the lighter fractions of the oil evaporated. Microbial activity further aided the transition to extra heavy oil.  Reserves  90% of the world's proven extra heavy oil reserves are located in Venezuela, mainly in the Orinoco Oil Belt. Extending over 55,000 square kilometers in area, with profitable reservoirs at least 50 meters thick, the Orinoco Oil Belt is considered the largest single hydrocarbon accumulation in the world, holding an estimated 1.18 trillion barrels of oil in place along with 135 trillion cubic feet of gas. The Carabobo oil field, the largest of the four fields, contains an estimated 513 billion barrels of oil in place split between its seven blocks. Carabobo-1, containing blocks Carabobo-1 North and Carabobo-1 Central, is the fourth largest onshore oil field in the world, containing 31 billion barrels of recoverable oil. The combined recoverable reserves of the three projects is estimated at more than 100 billion barrels.  Production  The Carabobo-1 project commenced production in December 2012, with its first well CGO-0005 producing 30,000 barrels of oil per day by 2013. It is expected to reach a peak production of 400,000 barrels of oil per day by 2018. The Carabobo-2 project is still in its early stage of development, yet to produce. The Carabobo-3 project has begun engineering for development, and expected to start producing 50,000 barrels of oil per day, with a peak production of 400,000 barrels of oil per day by 2020. Upgraders capable of processing 200,000 barrels of oil per day into a lighter synthetic oil are expected to be built by 2017 to convert the tar-like crude into an usable and exportable commodity. Many challenges are presented with the production of the extra heavy crude oil located in the Miocene tar sands. For starters, the extra heavy crudes have an average specific gravity of 4 to 16 ¬∞API, along with dynamic viscosities of 10,000 centipoise. These viscosities are equivalent to that of corn syrup, explaining the low recovery rates throughout the field. Stratigraphy is also a challenge to production, as the pinch out of the Miocene Ofacina formation is characterized by shale barriers caused by the juxtaposition of different mudstone and sandstone facies. Thus, many reservoirs in the field are less than 50 meters thick, which is deemed unrecoverable. Enhanced oil recovery methods have been implemented in the Carabobo oil field to improve the low recovery factors. Along with microbial enhanced oil recovery, which involves using microorganisms as biosurfactants to reduce the viscosities of the extra heavy crudes, immiscible gas injection, polymer flooding, and in situ combustion, better known as fireflooding, have all been used to improve the recovery of oil in the field. The advancements in horizontal drilling techniques have led to the use of steam assisted gravity drainage in extra heavy oil reservoirs. Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) involves drilling two holes, one above the oil and the other below. Steam is then injected into the upper hole, causing the steam to condense and heat the oil. The oil becomes less viscous, and drains into the hole below due to gravity. Using this method, recovery could be as high as 87%, which is a vast improvement over other methods in use for extraction of extra heavy crude oils.

Early life  Sheriff was born into a well-to-do South Carolina family and was the fifth child of seven. Her father, John Washington Sheriff, was a retail lumberman, and her mother a woman of ‚Äúmedical and educational philanthropy.‚Äù From a young age, she envisioned becoming a doctor, taking on this role when caring for her family's chickens, and playing with her dolls. She faced some doubt with the idea of studying medicine from her parents, as they thought it a ‚Äúchildish fantasy.‚Äù However, this did not keep her from attending the College of Charleston for two years before transferring to the Medical College of the State of South Carolina where she received her M.D. in 1926. Then, she interned at the Hospital of the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania and completed her residencies at the Children's Hospital in Washington, DC, and the Willard Parker Contagious Disease Hospital in New York.  Career  = Early career = She returned to Spartanburg, South Carolina in 1929 where she struggled to open a pediatrics practice for 2 years. Sheriff then received an invitation from the American Women's Hospitals Service to direct a unit in the Piedmont area of South Carolina, marking the beginning of her career in public health. As the Depression set in, Pellagra, a deficiency disease characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death, hit the poor Piedmont mill villages of South Carolina. During this time, Sheriff focused on her efforts on eliminating this disease and providing aid to working mothers through a ‚Äúhealthmobile,‚Äù a mobile clinic where she demonstrated healthy cooking practices, instructed women how to properly can fruits and vegetables, and examined the sick. This endeavor was highly successful, as Spartanburg saw a 50% reduction in pellagra from 1931 to 1933. Next, Sheriff opened four health clinics with assistance from the American Women's Hospital units she was in charge of. They provided assistance to mothers and infants and trained ‚Äúhealth aids,‚Äù who took their skills out into the rural communities. = Late career = In 1933, Sheriff was selected as the assistant director of the Spartanburg County, South Carolina Health Department. She became the director four years later. Spartanburg County Health Department was the most active health department during the time she was in charge, so active that Sheriff and other personnel were often lent to other counties. She was on the forefront of establishing the first family planning clinic in the United States that was affiliated with a county health department. She was the first female health officer who focused greatly on the needs of women and children. Sheriff went on to study public health at Harvard University upon receiving a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in 1936. She earned her Masters of Public Health the following year. In 1940, she took the position of assistant director of the Division of Maternal and Child Health in Columbia, South Carolina. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, she focused her efforts on programs to train and license midwives and later advocated for the prevention of child abuse. Sheriff retired from her positions as the deputy commissioner of the State Department of Health and Environmental Control and chief of the Bureau of Community Health Services in 1974.  Personal life  Sheriff married Dr. George Henry Zerbst at the age of 37, a former instructor. Her husband was an ophthalmologist, and they broke the conventional expectations of life revolved around family life. They spent a lot of time together, but they did not settle down and have kids. He died 33 years before she did. After she retired, she traveled the world, including South America, to help create programs in many different communities. She is an example of someone truly devoted to her work.

He was specifically targeted and fatally shot 5‚Äì7 times by two gunmen during a time of political discontent. The murder occurred around 9:30 am when Sarmiento walked from the local station after just finishing his morning news broadcast.  Personal  Among the last stories covered by Sarmiento was an accusation against a local Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate running for federal deputy who was seen accompanied in his political campaign by people using firearms reserved for the use of the Armed Forces. Oscar Valencia, the candidate, went on to win the election. Sarmiento did not have a wife or any children, but his brother is another Oaxaca journalist, Misael S√°nchez, of the newspaper El Tiempo. \\"I was at the radio station, put on the music and was considering scheduling, when I heard the detonations of firearm in the door,\\" said Guadalupe, who for five years accompanied Sarmiento in the project to install the station radio. The two subjects who completed the crime ran into the streets, one by Benito Juarez and the other by Porfirio D√≠az. The funeral was held on July 3, 2015. Career Filadelfo S√°nchez Sarmiento was a radio journalist and director for La Favorita 103.3 radio station. Sarmiento also wrote for local newspapers, including El Tiempo. La Favorita regularly received death threats toward Sarmiento on account of his criticism of public officials and his political stances. One local journalist, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal, told CPJ that S√°nchez had written reports criticizing local authorities' failure to implement adequate garbage pickup and to complete public works projects. Sarmiento had received death threats for some time, including at the office, by telephone or on Facebook and WhatsApp, but they had become more frequent recently, according to Imparcial Oaxaca. The newspaper reported that the journalist told his coworkers, \\"I'm afraid, be careful, they say they will bring me down.\\" According to The Yucat√°n Times, Mexico is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, and deaths like Sarmiento's are notorious in the southern state of Veracruz.PEN International ‚Äî Promoting freedom of expression and literature La Favorita celebrated its fifth anniversary of being on air just two months before the death of Sarmiento. Death Filadelfo S√°nchez Sarmiento was leaving the radio station La Favorita 103.3 when he was specifically targeted and fatally shot 5-7 times by two gang gunmen driving an unidentified vehicle on July 2, 2015 at 9 a.m. Sarmiento was killed as he moved down the street Margarita Maza de Juarez, in the district of San Francisco Municipal Railway fleet in the municipality of Miahuatl√°n de Porfirio D√≠az. He was shot after receiving daily death threats on account of his journalistic criticism. Sarmiento died instantly after being shot. After four hours of diligence, the remains were taken to the amphitheater of the Institute of Forensic Services for the purpose of law that an autopsy. During the review carried out at the site, they confirmed he had been shot four times, two of which entered the head. The bullets were confirmed to be 9mm casings. Context  At least four journalists were killed in connection to their work in South America in 2015. The largest number of attacks in 2015 took place in the states of Veracruz and Oaxaca, the same state Sarmiento was killed in. Journalist Kidnapping and murder of Mois√©s S√°nchez Cerezo was kidnapped in Veracruz in January and found decapitated and dismembered several weeks later. S√°nchez was the founder and director of the newspaper La Uni√≥n; the paper regularly criticized authorities for their failure to respond to local criminal activity, prompting death threats from the mayor of the town of Medell√≠n. In July, Veracruz Activist and journalist Rub√©n Espinosa, who had reported receiving numerous threats, was killed at an apartment in Mexico City. In Oaxaca, Mexico Armando Salda√±a Morales and Filadelfo S√°nchez Sarmiento were murdered in May and July, respectively. Sarmiento was known for coverage of local corruption, while Salda√±a antagonized criminal gangs with his reporting. In a crime not included in Committee to Protect Journalists tally, a community radio director in Oaxaca, Abel Bautista Raymundo, was killed in April, illustrating the frequent harassment and lack of protection for journalists in this sector. Miahuatlan was one of several locations in Oaxaca where election protests were mounted by members of the Coordinadora Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci√≥n, in which election materials were destroyed and political party offices attacked. The Director-General of UNESCO Irina Bokova urged the Mexican authorities to shed light on the killing of three journalists Filadelfo S√°nchez Sarmiento, Gerardo Nieto Alvarez and Juan Mendoza Delgado, who died between 26 June and 2 July. More than 80 media workers have been killed and another 17 reported missing in the past decade, according to Reporters Without Borders. Impact Sarmiento's death, coupled with the other horrendous deaths of fellow journalists in the same year, city officials were required to begin admitting the links between the deaths of these individuals and their profession due to Media rights groups demanding authorities investigate the deaths of three journalists in Mexico during the same week Sarmiento was killed. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the killing. It said that Sanchez Sarmiento hosted La Favorita and had written for local newspapers, including El Tiempo. He had received threatening phone calls. \\"We call on the Oaxaca, Veracruz and Guanajuato authorities to ensure that impartial, independent and thorough investigations are carried out and that those responsible for these despicable crimes are arrested,\\" Reporters Without Borders program director Lucie Morillon said. According to Freedom House, Low levels of funding and political will, bureaucratic rivalries, and lack of training are among the challenges that affect the federal government's ability to protect journalists. Journalists and human rights defenders who sought risk assessment and protection measures reportedly faced delays and inadequate safeguards, although some did benefit from the program during 2015, and the backlog of cases has been reduced. Nonetheless, ongoing problems were highlighted in an independent study conducted in 2015 by Espacio OSC, a coalition of civil society organizations. Reactions Oaxaca Gov. Gabino Cu√© Monteagudo called on state prosecutor Joaqu√≠n Ruiz-Gim√©nez to conduct a diligent investigation to solve the crime and arrest those responsible. Public officials were accused of often disregarded apparent links between such crimes and the victims' status as journalists. They were accused of refusing to admit Sarmiento's death had anything to do with his connection to the media. In the past, Veracruz authorities said Jos√© S√°nchez was a taxi driver rather than a journalist, and the federal attorney general's office were accused of using this justification for nonintervention in the case. Mexico City officials were similarly quick to blame Espinosa's death on his supposed presence at a party that featured prostitutes and drug use. As of year's end, at least one suspect had been arrested in the Salda√±a case; in the Espinosa case, several arrests were made, but Press freedom advocates assailed the investigation for failing to clarify numerous outstanding questions about the incident. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, despite increased international attention to the murders of journalists, governments fail to take action to reduce the high rates of targeted violence and impunity.

She was a founder of the Farmer Labor Party and in 1932 ran for Congress on its ticket. In the 1930s, she was considered one of the most influential women in the American labor movement and was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt to serve on the U.S. delegation to an International Labour Organization meeting in Europe. Early life and education Herstein was born in Chicago, Illinois to a Russian Jewish family that had emigrated to the United States from Lithuania. She was the youngest of six children of Wolf Herstein, the sexton of a synagogue, and Cipe Belle Herstein, who ran the C.B. Herstein Hebrew Book Store. Her father died when she was just 12, leaving the family in financial difficulties, and she was the only one of the children to go to high school. She graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in Latin and Greek (1907) and went on to get an M.A. from the University of Chicago (1924). Teaching After college, Herstein initially had difficulty getting a teaching job because of antisemitism. Once hired, she taught in various Illinois and Indiana high schools for five years before settling into the Chicago public school system. After a few years, she was promoted to teach at Crane Junior College, where she remained for the rest of her 36 years of teaching. One of her students, future Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, said Herstein inspired him to go into labor law. She also taught occasionally in junior colleges and at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Chicago, and the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry. Labor organizing and politics Around 1914, Herstein became active in labor organizing after joining a local affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers. She represented her union in the Chicago Federation of Labor (CFL) and for a quarter of a century was the only woman to serve on the CFL's executive board. She was also active in the local branch of the Women's Trade Union League and the Jewish Labor Committee, and she helped to organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first labor union led by African- Americans. In the 1930s, she headed up the workers' education program of the Chicago Works Progress Administration. She was known as an eloquent speaker and often went on speaking tours and radio shows. In the 1920s, she helped to found the Farmer Labor Party, and in 1932 she ran for Congress as its candidate, gaining less than 2% of the vote. In 1936, she worked for the reelection of President Franklin Roosevelt, and the following year he asked her to serve on the U.S. delegation to the International Labour Organization meeting in Switzerland. That same year, Life magazine referred to her as \\"the most important woman in the American labor movement\\". During World War II, Herstein served on the U.S. War Production Board as its Woman Consultant for the West Coast, where she helped women working in war industries. Herstein retired from teaching around 1951 but remained active in labor organizing and politics through the 1960s. She died in 1983, aged 97.

It is one of the oldest machairodont cat species in the Smilodontini and is believed to be an ancestor of Megantereon and Smilodon. Description Promegantereon is one of the oldest known true saber-toothed cats. Its fossils were discovered in Cerro de los Batallones, a Late Miocene fossil site near Madrid, Spain. However, it was only known from skull fragments from Eppelsheim until the early 1990s when the Cerro de los Battlones fossil beds were discovered. The animal was about high at the shoulder, similar to a leopard in size, but with a more supple body. The shape of its limbs suggests that it may have been an agile, scansorial climber, and could have hunted relatively large prey thanks to its elongate, flattened upper canines. In appearance it was highly similar to the contemporary Paramachairodus, so much so, they were and are often considered to be the same genus. However, due to its more primitive morphology as evidenced by Salesa et al. in 2002 with an in-depth description of its anatomy, Promegantereon ogygia is believed to be its own genus and species and therefore should remain separate from Paramachairodus. Paleoecology Promegantereon seemed to prefer open woodland habitat, as evidenced by finds at Cerro de los Batallones, which is a fossil deposit of Vallesian age. As a predator at Batallones, it would have hunted many of the relatively large herbivores of the time as well as the young of much larger animals. Such herbivores that it could hunt would have included horses like Hipparion, young of the hornless rhinoceros Aceratherium and the gomphotheriid mastodon Tetralophodon, the suid Microstonyx, and possibly the calves of silvatherid giraffes and boselaphine antelopes. Promegantereon would have competed for such prey with the Amphicyonid Magericyon, fellow machairodonts Machairodus and Paramachairodus, the bear Indarctos, and the small hyenid Protictitherium. While the much larger Indarctos, Machairodus and Magericyon would likely have been strongly competitive with for food and would likely have driven it from its kills when they sensed an opportunity, Paramachairodus and Protictitherium meanwhile, likely were less dangerous rivals that could be driven away or fought off. Pathology The specimens of Promegantereon at Batallones indicate that high percentages of canine breaks were present in this species. This indicates that they hunted in a similar manner to modern cats, a method of hunting that was much riskier due to the lack of protruding incisors.

This rifting continues through the early Cretaceous, and in the middle Cretaceous, begins to assist in the separation of Gondwana (In is what now southern Australia). During this same time, ocean crust is created to the west of Tasmania, and the separation of the Australian Plate from New Zealand, the Antarctic Plate, and the Campbell Plateau occurs.Mehin, K., and Bock, M. P., 1998, Cretaceous source rocks of the onshore Gippsland Basin Victoria; Victoria Initiative for Minerals and Petroleum Report 54, 98 p. During the late Cretaceous, more extension occurs in this region, which creates syn-rift troughs. This extension forms the central depression, which is an integral part of the petroleum system, and is the location of nearly all of the oil/gas fields in the Gippsland Basin. Also during the late Cretaceous, volcanism occurred due to the Tasman Sea rifting. From the Eocene to the middle Miocene, a compressional tectonic period begins, and forms a series of anticlines, as well as nearly all of the structural features present today.Mebberson, A.

Stratigraphy  = Strzelecki Group = The Strzelecki Group is a geologic group present in the Halibut Field area. The group was mainly deposited in the early Cretaceous. It is mainly composed of continental and lacustrine clastics. The lithology is predominantly nonmarine greywackes, and mudstones, with minor layers of sandstone, conglomerate, coals, and volcanoclastics. Depositional environments of this group include lakes, swamps, and floodplains. This group is the economic basement of the Halibut Field, meaning it is the stratigraphically lowest group for hydrocarbon production potential. This is known due to burial of 8 km or more in the offshore portion of the basin, which places the group in the overmature range. There is currently research being done on potential hydrocarbon reserves in the onshore portion of the Gippsland Basin. = Golden Beach Group = The Golden Beach Group lies unconformably above the Strzelecki Group, and was deposited in the late Cretaceous. The lithology of this group is shale, and sandstone. In addition to these major lithologic groups, there are also volcanic flows of andesitic- basaltic composition present.Clark, A. B. S., Thomas B.

S., and Lays, P., 1991, Tectonostratigraphic evolution of the south-east Gippsland Basin; The APEA Journal, v. 31, part 1, p. 116-130.Partridge, Alan D., 1996, Large break-up lakes of Bass Strait; Gippsland Basin Symposium, University of Melbourn, abstract, p. 3-6. The Kipper Shale Formation within this group is a 1,0000 m thick lacustrine shale. Though this would typically make a good source rock, it is believed that oxidation of organic matter inhibited the generation of hydrocarbons. = Latrobe Group = Stratigraphic Column of the Halibut Field, Australia The Latrobe Group is stratigraphically above the Golden Beach Group, and was deposited in the late Cretaceous to the Eocene. This group is the most valuable for hydrocarbon production, since it makes up the majority of the source rocks, and the reservoir rocks. The major rock types include sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, shale, coals, and volcanic rocks. These rock types are representative of alluvial, shoreline, and shallow shelf marine depositional environments.Douglas, J. G., 1976, Gippsland Basin; in Douglas, J. G., Abele, C., Benedek, S. Dettmann, M. E., Kenley, P. R., and Lawrence, C. R., Chapter 7, Mesozoic; in Douglas, J. G., and Ferguson, J. A., eds., Geology of Victoria, Geological Society of Australia Special Publication No. 5, p.158-176. The coals and shales of this group are the main source rock in this field, and throughout the basin. Sandstone from this group makes up the reservoir rocks, and exhibits a porosity of 20-25%, and a permeability of 5000-7000 millidarcies. This group has been subjected to much research due to its hydrocarbon implications. This has allowed researchers to reconstruct paleoshorelines, and paleoflow directions. Multiple transgressions and regressions are recorded in the rocks from the upper Paleocene to the Eocene. Throughout the area, the surrounding sandstones display a high amount of dolomite cement present, which drastically decreases porosity (it can make up to 30% of the total rock volume). Dissolution of this cement in hydrocarbon bearing sandstones, has not been completely understood by researchers. The small amount of research done on this phenomenon has pointed to hydrocarbon emplacement as the reason for dissolution. This is only due to the lack of evidence for other common causes of dolomite dissolution. = Seaspray Group = The Seaspray Group lies unconformably above the Latrobe Group, and was deposited in the Oligocene to the Miocene. This group makes up the majority of the seals in the region due to the unconformity with the Latrobe Group, as well as the low permeability of the rock types, which include shales, marls, limestones, calcareous claystones, siltstones, and sandstones. The typical depositional environments of these rock types, are low energy marine environments.  Petroleum geology  = Source rocks = The majority of the source rocks are coals, and coaly shales originating from the Latrobe group. The hydrocarbon formation is due to the high heat flow, and subsidence that occurred in the late Cretaceous through the early Paleocene. The shales of the Latrobe Group display Total Organic Carbon (TOC) values of 1-3% wt. = Reservoir rocks = Critical Moment of the Halibut Field, AustraliaThe reservoir rocks in this field are primarily sandstones from the Latrobe Group. The secondary porosity accounts for the majority of the porosity, and therefore its ability to contain hydrocarbons. The reason for this is due to the high amount of dolomite cement which filled up the pores, and then was dissolved by the hydrocarbons migrating into the pores. The porosity of the sandstones are 20-25%, and the permeability is 5000-7000 md. = Seals = The seals in this region are mainly marl, limestone, and sandstone from the Seaspray Group. These rock types are aided by being deposited on the Latrobe unconformity. This unconformity is due to the anticlines that formed in the Latrobe group being eroded, and then the Seaspray group being deposited on top of this erosional surface. = Traps = The traps in this oil field, are mainly late Eocene to middle Miocene in age. The traps were formed due to a small compressional event associated with the opening of the Tasman Sea. This is why anticlines, along with faults are the predominant trapping mechanism throughout the basin. The Halibut Field is located directly on an anticline, which serves as the trap. = Migration = Migration of the hydrocarbons is mainly vertical. Oil migration occurs from depths of 4‚Äì5 km, while gas migration occurs from depths of 5‚Äì6 km.  Production  The field was discovered in 1967, and has been producing oil and gas since 1970.Malek,R; Mehin,K, 1998 Oil and Gas Resources of Victoria Department of Natural Resources and Environment 1998 Petroleum Development The water depth is 73 m, and there are 14 producing wells. The oil water contact is located at approximately 2399 m depth. The porosity is 22%, and the permeability is 5000-7000 millidarcy. The oil gravity is 43.3, and is paraffinic. From 1970-2008 approximately 840,000,000 barrels of oil or approximately $105,000,000,000,000 (calculated with a price of $125.00 per barrel) was produced. The field is being produced by Esso Australia, which is a subsidiary of Exxon. The Gippsland Basin as a whole was Australia's largest petroleum producing basin from the mid 1960s when it was discovered until 1996 when the North West Shelf surpassed it. The basin was integral in Australia becoming a self sufficient petroleum producing country.
